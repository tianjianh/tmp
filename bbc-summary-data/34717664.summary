Tesla had a 50% rise in orders compared with the same period last year.
However higher costs hurt profits. Tesla's profits were $231m (Â£149m) in the period between July and September compared with $251m in 2014.
The company also announced it would release its Model 3 car, a mass market vehicle, at the end of March 2016.
The company expects to sell the Model 3 for $35,000.
Tesla opened two new stores in China this quarter and said it planned to open more as sales in the country grow.
Telsa reported it delivered 11,603 vehicles in the third quarter, slightly more than 11,580 it expected.
Shares of the company were up 7.5% in after-hours trading.
