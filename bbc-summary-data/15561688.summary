Get news notifications for your favourite sports

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
In the BBC Sport app you can now set notifications for football, cricket, tennis, golf and formula 1 news - ensuring you never miss any of the biggest stories from your favourite sports.

These five new notifications complement Top Stories, which already send out breaking sport news and reaction to more than 400,000 subscribers.
The notifications are easy to add - head to the My Notifications section of the menu and then choose the topics you are interested in.
You can also add score notifications for your football, rugby and cricket teams as well as Formula 1.
As an example, you might be a fan of Manchester City, the English football team, Lancashire cricket and Salford Rugby League, while also enjoying tennis.
In the app, you could set score notifications for Man City, England football, Salford and Lancashire, while also setting news notifications for football, cricket and tennis.
Whether it's a try for Salford, the start of a key Andy Murray match, a major football signing or the latest England cricket squad announcement, the news that matters to you would arrive on your homescreen.
Download the BBC Sport app on Android, iOS (Apple) or Kindle.
Notifications are notifications which pop up on to your phone's homescreen with key information. For example, if you set notifications for a football or rugby team, you can receive a notification every time a goal or point is scored in one of their matches, as well as notifications with the line-ups, half-time and full-time score.
Similarly, cricket fans might like to add England cricket notifications - these will let you know every time a wicket falls (with the batsman's score and team score), as well as notifications for end of innings scores and results.
The level of detail can be set for each type of notification, for example you might not want to know every time a wicket falls, you might just want the result. Similarly you might want Formula 1 notifications for qualifying but not the race itself if you're planning to watch the highlights later.
To add the notifications follow these steps.
You can of course easily turn notifications off - if, for example, you do not want to know the results of a match you're planning to watch highlights of on Match of the Day.
