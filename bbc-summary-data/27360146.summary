"Self-rule" referendums have been held in Ukraine's easternmost areas, with pro-Russian separatists claiming nearly 90% voted in favour in Donetsk region.

BBC reporters at polling stations in Donetsk and Luhansk regions spoke of chaotic scenes, no voting booths in places and no electoral register.
At least one person is reported to have been killed by armed men loyal to Ukraine's government.
Ukraine called the vote a "criminal farce" organised by Russia.
Western countries have also condemned the vote. Separatist leaders ignored a call by the Russian president to delay it.
The head of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic election commission Roman Lyagin told journalists that 89% voted in favour of self-rule, with 10% against, on a turnout of nearly 75%.
There are no results from the Luhansk area so far.

At the Primorsky polling station in Mariupol, a large crowd is gathered outside, waiting to vote. There is a crush of people inside.
Organisation is chaotic at best. There are no polling booths: people vote at the registration desks. People's details are hastily scribbled on generic forms. There is also a collection for money towards funding the Donetsk People's Republic.
The chairman of this polling station, Sergei Babin, said that people from other regions are permitted to vote here. He said their details would be taken down, and then, to ensure they haven't voted elsewhere, "the lists from different polling stations would be checked against each other".
Asked how long such a mammoth task would take, he replied "one day."
A Donetsk separatist leader, Denis Pushilin, told one Russian news agency that once the results are announced, all Ukrainian military troops in the region would be considered "occupying forces".
The shooting incident, in which separatist officials said at least one person had been killed, took place in Krasnoarmiisk, west of Donetsk city, after armed men supporting the Kiev government closed down a polling station.
A photographer with AP news agency reported seeing two people lying motionless on the ground.
A few hours before polling was due to close, separatist officials claimed turnout in Donetsk region had been close to 70% - but there was no independent confirmation. In other developments:
The ballot papers in Ukrainian and Russian ask one question: "Do you support the Act of State Self-rule of the Donetsk People's Republic/Luhansk People's Republic?"
A second round of voting is planned in a week's time, on joining Russia. Organisers also say they will boycott Ukraine's presidential elections on 25 May.
Ukraine's interim President Olexandr Turchynov has admitted many in the east supported pro-Russian militants, but warned the referendums were "a step towards the abyss".
