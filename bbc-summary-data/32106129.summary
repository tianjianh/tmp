SNP conference: Stewart Hosie to tell party it must turn polls into reality

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The SNP will "work like never before" to turn the party's current standing in the polls into MPs at Westminster, the party's depute leader will pledge.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Stewart Hosie will tell his party's conference in Glasgow that the only way to make sure Westminster delivers will be to have SNP MPs at Westminster.
Recent polling has suggested that the SNP is on course to winning the majority of Scotland's 59 seats.
The UK's electorate will vote for their next MPs on 7 May.
Mr Hosie, who succeeded Nicola Sturgeon as SNP deputy leader last November, will close his party's conference later.
With less than six weeks to go to the general election, he will say that a vote for the SNP is needed to help bring about an end to austerity and deliver more powers for Holyrood.
He will stress to delegates: "The only way to make sure Westminster delivers - on anything - will be to return the largest ever number of SNP MPs to Westminster."
With both the Conservatives and Labour "signed up to another Â£30bn of cuts" he will say the UK is "on track for a decade of austerity - unless we achieve change by voting SNP for investment in jobs and growth".
The MP will insist that while "austerity has failed" the nationalists offer a "real alternative" to the election.
Mr Hosie will add: "We know the opinion polls are in our favour. But this is only potential.
"Our job is now to work like never before. To turn this electoral potential into votes and seats. If we do that then this nation will prosper and flourish."
