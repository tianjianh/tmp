Contenders for The Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA) annual award include a castle, a former glass warehouse and a school sports pavilion.
The winners will be announced at a ceremony in Nottingham later.
This 19th century cart shed and outbuildings on the Chatsworth estate have been transformed into a series of teaching and presentation places. Architects used traditional stone, historic lime mortars and stainless steel to help preserve the buildings.
This house was designed in a curve to reflect the contours and meadows of the Peak District. The stone and natural timber material used were chosen to reflect a dry stone wall or a stone barn typical of the area.
Derby Arena includes a 250m indoor cycle track, 1,500-capacity grandstand and a sports infield. The venue has been described as "world class" by four-time Olympic gold medallist and Tour de France winner Sir Bradley Wiggins.
A garage, garden store and the remains of an old piggery have been demolished to make way for a new building that includes a kitchen and bathroom. Located between the main house and garden, the owners hope to use it as a weekend retreat.
Two buildings have combined to create a new entrance for the university's Clifton campus. They have replaced worn out 1960s' teaching blocks and incorporate classroom and lecture spaces.
This former 1970s glass warehouse has been turned into printmaking studios, a library, gallery and educational space. The restoration of the building, in the city's Cultural Quarter, was part funded by Arts Council England.
Visitors to Lincoln Castle can now complete a full circuit of the walls as part of the introduction of a series of stairwells, a new railing system and bridges. The project also created a new vault for their copy of Magna Carta and Charter of the Forest. It is, as such, the only place where both documents can be seen together.
The focal point of this Â£40m development in Nottingham is a 160m facade which has filled a hole in the city's streetscape. Balconies, pavilions and terraces on the south side of the building create viewing points for the canal below.
The Nottingham University Academy of Science and Technology (NUAST) offers a specialist curriculum to 14 and 19-year-olds. The three-storey entrance takes visitors into the school's innovation hub with screens allowing them to overlook the science and engineering activities inside.
This building, which has been built on the site of the previous pavilion, is a continuation of the school's 160-year cricketing history. It is also more energy efficient and allows for views across the school's rugby pitches.
This house was created on the site of a smaller, existing dwelling. It stands alone, remote from the nearest village, on a ridge of higher ground overlooking the rolling landscape of a nearby farm.
The building's protruding barrel-vaulted zinc roofs have been created to mimic Welbeck Abbey. The collection's entrance allows visitors to look out onto a line of trees and a 19th century lodge.
