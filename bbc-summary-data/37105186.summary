Business owners Ted and Lucy Hocknell died following the blaze at their home in Gannock Park West, Deganwy, Conwy, at about 07:40 BST on Tuesday.
Mr Hocknell, 93, was awarded the Ushakov medal by the Russian government in 2014 for helping to keep Arctic supply lines open during World War Two.
Friend Ian Turner said: "I am really going to miss him."
Mr Turner said his friend, a former policeman, once saved two children cut off by the tide on Llandudno's West Shore and chased and pinned down a handbag thief on his way home from the shops.
"He wouldn't have used the word hero, he just did what he did," he said.
"He was a really nice guy. It is very sad they had to go in such a way."
The couple owned Bryant and Hocknell furniture shop on Gloddaeth Street.
Mr Turner said Mrs Hocknell, 88, was a former hairdresser and a "real lady".
"She was a proper lady, she was always seen in town walking arm in arm with her sister," he said.
Aberconwy AM Janet Finch-Saunders said: "I think we're all stunned. They were such a dear, much-respected and well-liked couple, who were so well-known in the town.
"The town will miss them tremendously."
Following the blaze, thought to have been caused by an electrical fault, the couple were brought out of the house but died afterwards.
Another woman managed to escape before firefighters arrived.
