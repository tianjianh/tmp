Larne: Two houses attacked by men wielding 'hatchets'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Two houses in Larne, County Antrim, have been damaged in pre-dawn attacks by masked men armed with what are believed to have been hatchets.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
One of the homes attacked belonged to a 27-year-old man arrested last month as part of an investigation into dissident republican activity.
He was later released without charge.
Men smashed windows and damaged the door of a Seahill Road house at about 01:20 BST. A house on Fleet Street was attacked at roughly the same time.
A couple in their 20s and their young son - who were in the Seahill Road house at the time - were not injured.
At the Fleet Street property, damage was caused to the inside of the house as well as to windows and a door.
Again, a couple in their 20s who were in the house at the time were not injured.
The PSNI are working to establish whether there is a link between the two incidents and a car later found burned out in a field at Walnut Avenue in the town.
Sinn FÃ©in MLA Oliver McMullan has condemned those responsible for the attacks, and called on the PSNI to dedicate additional resources to the Larne area.
Mr McMullan said: "Attacks of this nature are becoming all too prevalent in Larne.
"There is a palpable fear within the local community as these attacks continue.
"There is a need to address this violence and intimidation as it cannot be allowed to continue at these levels."
