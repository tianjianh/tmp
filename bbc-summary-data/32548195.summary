Birmingham City club captain Paul Robinson has signed a new one-year contract with the Championship club.

The 36-year-old former Watford and West Bromwich Albion defender was without a club when he joined Blues on a one-month trial deal in September 2012.
But this new contract, in a player-coach role, is his fourth for Blues as he continues to extend a career that now totals more than 700 appearances.
Robinson has not figured since being sent off at Bournemouth on 6 April.
But he has still clocked up 36 appearances this season, taking his total number of games in a royal blue shirt to 119.
"Robbo is an influential person around the dressing room and been a good help to me since I've come in," Rowett told BBC WM. "And I still think he can offer something on the pitch.
"There is an opportunity to become a squad defender and still be influential around the club and help some of the youngsters in a coaching capacity, maybe one or two days a week.
"Sometimes it's hard to find someone that can offer a multitude of things. They can help the young players with that game understanding and that knowledge of winning things and doing things properly in football, because that's something you don't often get in academies.
"Every time he pulled on the captain's armband he gave it everything he's got. He's a real winner and a real leader and sometimes I don't think there are enough of those around clubs in the game."
