The 25-year-old, who made 11 appearances on loan at Rotherham United last season, began his career at city rivals Dundee United.
"At this time in my career this is the right place for me," said former West Brom and Hibernian player Allan.
Fellow midfielder Roarie Deacon, also 25, has signed a two-year deal with Dundee, having most recently played for non-league Sutton United.
The pair become Neil McCann's first signings since becoming permanent Dundee manager earlier this month, having earlier been interim boss.
Allan struggled to make an impact in his first season at Celtic Park, earning only three starts from 14 appearances.
Alan Stubbs, who signed him at Hibs, took the midfielder on loan at Rotherham after becoming Millers boss last summer. He returned to Celtic in January, but has not featured in a competitive match under Brendan Rodgers.
"I wouldn't say I have been disappointed," said Allan. "I have learned a lot. I think I am a better player for it.
"I got a [Scottish Premiership] winners' medal in the first year [at Celtic], I learned a lot from Brendan Rodgers in pre-season last year and I took the decision to go on loan - so I have no regrets.
"It didn't go well for me last season down south so it was about getting back up the road and getting playing again. That's why I made this decision.
"I am just happy to get the opportunity to play football week in, week out.
"Hopefully the club will get in the top six, get a cup run and I do well myself. That's my main aims."
England Under-19 international Deacon featured during Sutton's run to the FA Cup fifth round last term, where they were beaten by his former club Arsenal.
He scored 11 goals in 48 appearances last term.
