[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Maria Adams drove up and down the car park of Tesco in Roker, Sunderland, as her friend held on to a towel hanging out of the boot of her Nissan Juke.
Newcastle Crown Court heard her friend did not require a wheelchair but had jumped in one owned by the store to take part in the prank.
Judge Penny Moreland said the driving was a "piece of stupidity".
Adams, 20, from Whitburn, South Tyneside, admitted dangerous driving.
The court heard shoppers watched as the man in the wheelchair let go of the towel and was sent "whizzing along with the momentum".
She was disqualified from driving for two years, ordered to pay £1,369 prosecution costs and a £60 victim surcharge.
She was also given a four-month curfew and a 12-month community order.
