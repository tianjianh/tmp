Residents of a Scottish Borders town have voted resoundingly in favour of the construction of a bypass.

The ballot in Selkirk saw 82.7% back the move which has been debated for more than a decade.
The total number of votes cast was 451 - with 373 in favour and 66 in opposition with 12 spoiled papers.
The result was announced by Scottish Borders councillor Gordon Edgar, who is also vice-chairman of the  A7 Action Group.
Earlier this year Transport Minister Humza Yousaf said he was "open minded" about a bypass for the town.
He said the action group should make a renewed case for the project.
