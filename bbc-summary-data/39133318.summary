[SN]TITLE[SN]
Welsh dragon to feature on gold and silver coins

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Welsh dragon is to feature on a range of gold and silver bullion coins.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
It is part of the Royal Mint's "Queen's Beasts" series, which celebrates ten creatures from centuries of royal heraldry.
The red dragon design will appear on one ounce and quarter-ounce gold coins, as well as on a two-ounce silver coin.
Designer Jody Clark said: "I wanted to replicate the sense of strength and courage the beasts were designed to convey."
