Rebecca Minnock, 35, and Ethan disappeared from their home in Highbridge, Somerset, on 26 May.
Ms Minnock told The Sun she had "lost all trust and faith in the system completely" following a custody battle in which a judge ruled Ethan should live with his father.
Police say Ms Minnock may have been spotted in Cheltenham or Birmingham.
Ms Minnock contacted The Sun through a family member, the newspaper said.
She told the newspaper: "We're both safe and well and he is very happy."
She added: "I couldn't bear to leave my son. I just felt trapped.
"I know I'm going to be in a huge, huge amount of trouble.
"I've even got family members into trouble but it's my son and I need to put him first over myself or anybody else."
The newspaper said it did not know where Ms Minnock was hiding.
Speaking before Ms Minnock confirmed she and her son were safe, Det Ch Insp Marie Wright, of Avon and Somerset Police, said she was worried about the "emotional impact" on Ethan and his mother of weeks in hiding
"Rebecca needs to return Ethan back to the court process where he is going to live with his father," she said.
"Rebecca knows this and she is evading the court process.
"Ethan's father is very upset, as you would expect. Ethan needs to go and live with him."
On Sunday Ms Minnock's brother, sister and mother were arrested, accused of withholding information.
They told a judge at Bristol Crown Court they did not know her whereabouts - he said he had suspicions they knew more but released them from the court, saying he was "not satisfied" he could commit them for contempt of court based on the evidence he had heard.
Ms Minnock is about 5ft 3ins (1.6m) tall and of medium build. At the time of her disappearance she had dark wavy shoulder-length hair. Ethan has blond hair and blue eyes.
He has lived with his mother since his parents separated in February 2013.
A month later, his father Roger Williams, applied for contact with him.
On 27 May this year a district judge ruled Ethan should live with his father after finding Ms Minnock had made false allegations and obstructed contact between the father and son.
