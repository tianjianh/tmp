Police said the man's silver mountain bike collided with a black Mercedes.
The driver of the car, who was uninjured, stopped and has been helping police with the inquiries. The road was closed for several hours while crash investigation were carried out.
Officers have appealed for witnesses.

"I am appealing for anyone who saw either the man on his bike - he was wearing every day clothing and was not in specialised cycling clothes - or the car around this time.
"We would like to hear from anyone who can assist us in any way."
In a separate incident, police are also seeking information after a 59-year-old man was injured following a collision with a marked police car on  Edinburgh's Wester Hailes Road.
