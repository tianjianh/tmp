Lubov wishes she could have finished her studies before she got married to her husband, but she is very proud of her community's traditions and is keen to keep them alive.
She has tried living in urban areas, but says she cannot stand the noise.
Her story is part of a series of six short films for the BBC 100 Women season called 'Good Girl', in which young women around the world talk about the pressure to fit in with society's expectations.
Video produced by Olga Ivshina and Max Lomakin
