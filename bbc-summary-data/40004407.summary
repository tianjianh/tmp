Shaun Derry's job title at Cambridge United has been changed from manager to head coach after an end-of-season review by the League Two club.

The 39-year-old has been in charge since November 2015.
The head coach role "will allow Shaun to focus on the selection, tactics, coaching and management of the first team", according to a club statement.
Head of football operations Ben Strang will oversee other departments, including recruitment and the academy.
Derry led to U's to an 11th-placed finish in the fourth tier this season as they missed out on the League Two play-offs on the final day.
Cambridge chief executive Jez George said: "Shaun suggested to me that his title changed to head coach to more aptly describe his role, which had evolved within the overall structure of our football operation during the course of last season.
"To be clear, Shaun's autonomy in the overall management of the first team remains unaltered.
"The position of head coach rather than manager simply reflects our football structure, which ensures the long-term development of our infrastructure, staff and philosophy is implemented by a head of football operations.
"Ben Strang has gradually assumed more of these responsibilities, while still leading our recruitment department, so it makes sense that his responsibilities are clearly defined going forward."
