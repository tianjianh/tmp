Handscomb (110) joined David Warner and Matt Renshaw in making centuries as Australia - who are seeking a series clean sweep - declared on 538-8.
Josh Hazlewood then took two wickets in five balls to leave the tourists 16-2.
Azhar Ali (58) and Younus Khan (64) helped Pakistan reach 126-2 at close of play on day two, still 412 runs behind.
Handscomb, playing in his fourth Test, had resumed on 40 with Australia 365-3 and brought up his second Test century with a single off his 194th ball.
But the 25-year-old was out in bizarre circumstances when a television review showed his bat had dislodged a bail while playing a cut shot, resulting in a rare hit-wicket dismissal.

"Any time you can make a Test hundred is always going to feel amazing. It's just been incredible," said Handscomb, who will play for Yorkshire this season.
Renshaw earlier fell short of dislodging Don Bradman as Australia's youngest double centurion, the 20-year-old left-hander playing on to his stumps for 184 in the first hour of the day.
Debutant all-rounder Hilton Cartwright (37), Matt Wade (29) and Mitchell Starc, who hit two huge sixes in his 16, also departed before the declaration.
Pakistan bowlers Mohammad Amir and Yasir Shah both struggled with injuries as the visitors toiled in the field.
