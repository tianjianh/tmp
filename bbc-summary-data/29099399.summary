[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A teenager has been left with permanent facial scarring after an "unprovoked" slashing attack in Clydebank.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 16 year old was waiting for a taxi with two friends in Faifley Road in the early hours of Saturday morning when a man approached them.
Police said he began talking to them, then slashed the victim and walked off.
The boy was treated at the Western Infirmary, then transferred to the Southern General hospital where he needed a number of stitches.
The suspect is described as white, aged about 30, of stocky build and approximately 6ft tall.
He was wearing a dark-coloured Stone Island hooded jacket and had a Rangers scarf around his face.
Det Con Clare Moran, of Police Scotland, said: "This was a horrific attack on a young boy which has left him with permanent facial scarring.
"From what we believe, it was completely unprovoked, neither the victim nor his friends knew the assailant.  I am appalled that someone would do this then casually walk off.
"It is important that we trace this individual and I would appeal to anyone who was in the area or recognises the distinct description to come forward."
The attack took place at about 04:05 outside 174 - 190 Faifley Road.
Two hours later, in a separate incident, another teenager was also assaulted in Clydebank.
The 19-year-old was attacked at about 06:10 outside St Stevens Chapel in Park Road.
A witness saw the  man lying on the ground being attacked by two males with weapons.
The attackers then got into a silver or light grey coloured small car, thought to be driven by a third person.
It was driven off in the direction of Stevenson Street and Duntocher Road.
The victim was admitted to the Western Infirmary with injuries to his head, face and hand.
The suspects were described as white males, in their late teens to early 20s.  One was approximately 5ft 9in - 5ft 10in tall, of lean build, wearing dark clothing.
The other one was appromately 5ft 7in - 5ft 8in, of stocky build, wearing a white or grey coloured tee shirt.
Det Con Chris Norton said: "We have not yet been able to get a full statement from the victim to establish if he knew the motive for this senseless attack.
"Although it was relatively early in the morning, I would urge anyone who heard the disturbance or witnessed this crime to come forward.
"I would also ask anyone who saw the silver or grey coloured car in the area or has any information which may lead to identifying those involved to speak to police."
Anyone with information about either attack is asked to phone the CID at Clydebank on the non-emergency number 101.
