Belgian capital Brussels, 35 miles away, remains on a high state of alert amid the threat of Paris-style attacks.
The British team arrived in Ghent on Monday, a day later than planned as security arrangements for the final were confirmed.
"Everyone, I think, is very comfortable in the team," said Murray.
"It was obviously a bit concerning a few days ago," Murray added. "I think once we got here and got into the hotel, came to the venue and saw what it was like here, I think that made everyone a lot more comfortable."
Britain will try to win the Davis Cup for the first time since 1936 when the final - their first since 1978 - gets under way on Friday.
The team consists of Andy Murray and his brother Jamie, Kyle Edmund, James Ward and Dom Inglot, with Dan Evans included as a hitting partner. Including coaches and trainers, the playing staff in Ghent number 13 people.
British captain Leon Smith said it had been the correct decision to delay travelling by 24 hours, with the team arriving via Flanders airport on Monday.
Extra security measures have been put in place at the Flanders Expo for the three-day final, as Brussels remains under a security lockdown.
"We made the right decision to delay it - it helped calm things down a little bit," Smith told BBC Sport.
"I know it's a different picture in Brussels and of course there are natural concerns for people who were either opting to stay there or travel through there, but all I can say, and the team can say, is that it is very, very normal in Ghent.
"It is quiet, it's calm and we're not seeing any different issues here. Ghent feels very, very safe."
Murray added: "Everyone was a little bit concerned. Everything seems fine in Ghent. I know in Brussels it's a slightly different situation, but everything seems fine here. "
Smith liaised with the players over the weekend but Jamie Murray said he was "always planning on coming and playing".
He added: "Obviously things had happened that made it a bit more concerning. But we're here, we're training, business as normal. We're ready to play on Friday."
Andy Murray said: "I think we just listened to all of the right people. They have a fantastic security team here.
"At [most] ties you think everything is fine, and the security, you don't necessarily need it. But in situations like this, it's great we have such capable people that are able to give us the best advice."
The British team were well wrapped up when they faced the media on Tuesday, with the temperature in the venue around 3C as both teams practised.
Murray described conditions as "really cold", adding: "Hopefully it won't be like this over the weekend."
Smith has yet to make a decision on his second singles player, but Edmund, ranked 100th, could be in line to make his Davis Cup debut having won a Challenger title nine days ago.
"In sport you want to play, especially for your country," said the 20-year-old from Yorkshire. "You want to do your best. You just deal with it when it comes to it."
The captains must make their final team nominations one hour before the draw, which takes place at 13:00 GMT on Thursday.
