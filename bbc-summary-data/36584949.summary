[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An employee at ferry operator Caledonian MacBrayne has won an award for her efforts to help seven island weddings to go ahead.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Demi Wylie organised a small team to liaise with the couples and guests during industrial action that affected CalMac sailings in June last year.
Travel plans for more than 600 people were adjusted so they could reach the Western Isles weddings.
Ms Wylie, 23, was recognised at the 2016 Scottish Transport Awards.
She won the Frontline Employee of the Year category at a ceremony in Glasgow.
Ms Wylie is based in CalMac's contact centre in Gourock which handles calls across the company's services.
Ferries had been key to getting brides, grooms and many of their guests to ceremonies and venues for the weddings across the Hebridean islands chain.
Ms Wylie and her team identified services that were running, or running at different times, and rebooked the wedding parties on those ferries.
The industrial action came amid a row over tendering process for the Clyde and Hebrides Ferries Network.
