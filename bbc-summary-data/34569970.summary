Family horror film Goosebumps scared audiences up a treat at the North American box office at the weekend.

The movie, based on the popular children's book series, took $23.5m (£15.2m) in its first three days.
It stars Jack Black as horror writer RL Stine, whose imaginary demon creations are accidentally set free in a small town.
Ridley Scott's space adventure The Martian was bumped into second place, taking $21.5m (£13.9m).
The Matt Damon film has now taken $143.8m (£93m) in its third week of release.
Steven Spielberg's cold-war thriller Bridge of Spies, starring Tom Hanks, opened at number three with $15.4m (£10m).
Guillermo del Toro's gothic horror romance Crimson Peak did not fare as well in the Halloween period, debuting at four with $12.8m (£8.3m).
However with an R-rating - where those under 17 need to be accompanied by a parent of guardian to see the film - it was expected to have a more limited audience than the PG-rated Goosebumps.
'Horrendous result'
This weekend also saw the release of Cary Fukunaga's drama Beasts of No Nation, about child soldiers in Africa.
After making headlines earlier this year when Netflix bought the distribution rights for $12m (£7.8m), the film was simultaneously released in cinemas and on the streaming platform.
But the film, starring Idris Elba, only made $50,699 (£32,800) across the 31 cinemas it was shown at, averaging $1,635 (£1,057) per theatre.
Although rival distributors called it "a horrendous result", Netflix told Deadline it would not release information about the film's streaming performance, but added it was "very happy".
It is understood the film was given a limited theatrical release to qualify it for the upcoming awards season.
In a limited release, abduction drama Room also earned a respectable $120,000 (£77,600) from four screens.
