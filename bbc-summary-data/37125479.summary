The Ireland duo had been lying eighth overall going into the final event.
The pair are likely to go their separate ways after the Games, having previously competed in the 2012 Olympics, in which they were 14th.
Carrickfergus man Seaton, 26, and McGovern, 28, from Bangor, had been in fourth halfway through the competition.
Their position at that stage was boosted by a win in one of Saturday's races.
"We made a good start and things were looking good but it was a real tricky course," said McGovern after the final race.
Seaton added: "We had some really good races during the week and worked well as a team - we were just a bit unlucky with the wind shifts on Thursday.
"Obviously we are a bit disappointed as we came here to get a medal but at least we can walk away from the event saying we gave 100%.
"We pushed even harder for this cycle than we did for London 2012 and we can be proud of ourselves for that."
New Zealand's pre-event favourites Peter Burling and Blair Tuke secured the gold medal, with Nathan Outteridge and Iain Jensen of Australia taking silver and Erik Heil and Thomas Ploessel of Germany claiming bronze.
