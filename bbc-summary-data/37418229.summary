[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A conservation organisation has likened campaigners trying to halt the restoration of wetlands in the New Forest to "climate change deniers".

The attack on Friends of Latchmore Brook's tactics was made by the New Forest Association (NFA) in a row over work on a stream near Hyde.
The NFA said the Friends were using "inaccuracies" to support their case.
But the Friends said they were "not impressed" by the "language employed" by the NFA.
The scheme intends to recreate the stream's meanders which were present before Victorian engineers diverted the watercourse and drained the land, but campaigners want the area to remain as it is.
The planning application by the Forestry Commission is supported by the NFA which has entered into a war of words with Friends of Latchmore Brook.
Writing on the Friends' fundraising page, campaigner Fiona MacDonald cited concerns about lorry movements and the materials used, claiming the stream would be "irreparably damaged" and protected wildlife "destroyed".
NFA landscape committee chairman Brian Tarnoff described the group as "well meaning" but added they "ought to feel a little bit queasy over these inaccuracies, which could lead to allegations of a scam".
Dr MacDonald, a fish vet, said "the wording used" on its fundraising page was "based on scientific fact, plus expert comments and observations".
Forestry Commission surveyor Bruce Rothnie said his organisation had worked with independent wildlife experts and Natural England on the application, due to be determined next month.
He added: "Other organisations that are working to protect the New Forest, such as the New Forest Association and Hampshire and Isle of Wight Wildlife Trust, are supportive of our restoration work, which aims to return the rivers and streams that were artificially straightened to a state of naturalness, and offer the chance to improve the habitat for our wildlife."
