Jealous Christopher Revell, 31, smashed a pint glass over the Teesside-born singer's head while he was out with friends in a Redcar pub in August.
Mr Arthur, 28, who needed five staples to a head wound, was also punched.
Revell, who has 12 previous convictions for violence, admitted wounding with intent at Teesside Crown Court.
Prosecutor Nick Dry said: "James Arthur and his group were walking towards the beer garden when without warning or provocation Mr Revell smashed a glass forcibly on the back of his head.
"As he stumbled forward from the incident the defendant followed up with a punch."
He said Revell, a former cable fitter from Redcar, had initially denied using a glass.
Mr Dry added: "He claimed he had attacked [Mr Arthur] because he had slept with an ex-girlfriend some time ago.
"He said he had lost it and whacked him as hard as he could. He denied using a glass and said he had gone into a rage when Arthur smirked at him."
The court heard Revell has 12 previous convictions for offences including including battery and assault.
In a statement read out in court, Mr Arthur, from Middlesbrough, claimed he initially feared the injuries would affect his music career and said he felt nervous to visit friends and family in his home town.
Andrew Turton, defending, said Revell had lost his home and his job working offshore as a result of the attack.
Sentencing Revell, Judge Tony Briggs said: "It's clear from your record that you are someone who has difficulty controlling your temper."
