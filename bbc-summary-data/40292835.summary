Higgins, 23, made 38 appearances for Southport last season and now joins National League side Torquay following the Sandgrounders' relegation.
The former Chester and Telford right-back becomes the club's fourth summer signing following Josh Gowling, Jon-Paul Pittman and Jake Gosling.
"His athletic potential is fantastic and he's hungry to climb the league again," manager Kevin Nicholson said.
