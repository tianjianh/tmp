Scottish independence: Edinburgh University runs online referendum course

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The University of Edinburgh is running a six-week online course about Scotland's independence referendum.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
'Towards Scottish Independence? Understanding the Referendum' is the latest Massive Open Online Course (Mooc) being offered by the university.
The course is open to anyone and gets under way on 25 August.
It provides background information on the referendum and features online debates and video presentations.
Opinion polls will be held at regular intervals to find out if the course is affecting how participants will vote.
It is being led by political academics Professor Charlie Jeffery, Professor Nicola McEwen and Dr Alan Convery.
Professor Jeffery said: "We will place learners at the heart of the referendum question by examining arguments for and against independence, with lively debate guided by university academics.
"We will also ensure a distinct international dimension, by examining implications for other nations and regions whose populations have expressed desire for greater autonomy, including Catalonia, Flanders and Quebec."
The University of Edinburgh is running the course in partnership with the social learning platform FutureLearn.
Since the university launched their Moocs in July 2012, more than 900,000 people have signed up to take part.
