Slovenia's Peter Prevc became the first man ever to jump over 250m on Saturday.
The previous record of 246.5m was set in 2011 by Johan Remen Evensen from Norway.
But Prevc only held the record for 24 hours.
On Sunday Norway's Anders Fannemel went 1.5m further with a new world record of 251.5m.
Check out just how far the guys jumped in the clip above - it's pretty impressive.
