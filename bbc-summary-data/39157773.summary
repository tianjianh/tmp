Caddie is a specially trained autism assistance Labrador from the "Dogs for Good" charity and helps calm anxiety.
He was given to 13-year-old Joel Sayer from Newquay and has helped him carry out everyday tasks like brushing his teeth and walking to the shops.
Joel said: "Caddie is my special friend, my super dog. This world we live in I find hard, I find everything hard, but Caddie keeps me calm and keeps me safe."
The pair are finalists in the Crufts Friends for Life hero dog competition which celebrates dogs providing a "lifetime service, support, love and devotion".
