Mansfield manager Steve Evans says his players have given him "everything" after winning his first two games since taking charge of the League Two side.

Danny Rose scored the only goal as they earned their second home win in four days against Blackpool on Tuesday.
Evans took over from Adam Murray on 16 November with the team 18th in the table, but they are now up to ninth.
"I just said when I came in, the minimum you give me is everything," he told BBC Radio Nottingham.
"At the minute they're giving me everything, and we're still judging if they've got enough ability to play a part."
Evans praised Rose, 22, whose winning goal was his first since scoring against Newport on the opening day of the season.
"They made a mistake and a young man that's been out of the picture here, young Rosey, pops up and gets the goal," he said.
"There's no one out of the picture here, it's my job to embrace every player and give every one of them an opportunity and I'm glad he's taken it."
