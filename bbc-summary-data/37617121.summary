Concerns over Cardigan library council relocation plan

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Plans to move a town library to council offices are expected to get the green light on Wednesday.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The proposal, to change the use of council offices at Morgan Street in Cardigan, would mean the library is relocated from Canolfan Teifi, Pendre.
But there have been 13 letters of objection from the public, and a 1,000-strong petition has been handed to Ceredigion council.
Cardigan town council raised questions about parking and pedestrian crossings.
Objections from the public included access problems, a lack of computer facilities and that it would be located "on a very busy road and at a dangerous junction".
The move was also described as a "complete waste of money and time".
A report to the council said it had no control over the decision to close the existing library and that the new location was served by public transport and would be accessible by foot.
