Footage captured Simon King's camera showed a man climbing over a fence and making off across a garden at a property in Herne Hill, south London.
Nigel Batton, 43, was convicted of one count of burglary and one count of attempted burglary at Woolwich Crown Court.
Batton, of Marischal Road, Lewisham, was sentenced on Monday.
The burglary took place at a property in Hollingbourne Road in Herne Hill.
The footage, which showed Batton in a nearby property's garden, was captured on Mr King's camera, which streams live on his website, at about 03:45 BST on 12 January 2014.
After it was released by police, a number of people contacted officers and identified Batton.
Police said a scarf left at the scene of the crime contained Batton's DNA and a cardigan worn by the burglar in the video was also found at Batton's home address,
Det Con Marie Hamilton, from Southwark police, said: "The images from the fox family camera were brilliant and together with the forensics we have been able to ensure that Batton has been brought to justice."
Mr King has featured in various BBC programmes including Springwatch, Big Cat Diary and Planet Earth.
