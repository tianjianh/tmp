They join Will Keane, Lazar Markovic, Ryan Mason, David Meyler and Moses Odubajo on the sidelines.
Tottenham await news on whether full-backs Kieran Trippier and Kyle Walker will be fit to return.
Christian Eriksen is likely to be recalled after being rested against Leicester on Thursday, while Filip Lesniak could be handed a start.
Martin Fisher: "On the final day of last season, Tottenham travelled to an already relegated club and lost 5-1. I very much doubt that lightning will strike twice.
"A year ago Spurs were physically and mentally exhausted after failing to overhaul Leicester in the title race. They're in much better shape now as Leicester themselves can testify after being hit for six on Thursday.
"Hull's immediate return to the Championship was effectively confirmed when they choked at home to Sunderland.
"Their future looks grim. Marco Silva is already being linked with other managerial jobs. The likes of Harry Maguire, Sam Clucas and Andrew Robertson will be targets too. Off the field the ownership issue remains unresolved.
"This might be their last Premier League game for some time."

Hull boss Marco Silva: "I want the players to play with the motivation to end the season well in front of our own fans.
"That is our focus, but of course we are playing against a team that is in a good place at this moment.
"Tottenham have had a very good season and play some very good football, but we want to give our fans one last good result this season."
Tottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino: "We will keep the players that we want to keep. Maybe we will sell the players that we want to sell.
"I think we are so, so, so calm about our big players and they are so happy here.
"We are building a very exciting project."
Tottenham said goodbye to White Hart Lane with a deserved win over Manchester United and they will want to finish the season strongly despite missing out on the title.
