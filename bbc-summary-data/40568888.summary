The flight, known as the BBMF, is based at RAF Coningsby in Lincolnshire, and has one of only two airworthy Lancaster bombers in the world.
It was formed to honour those involved in the Battle of Britain and has taken part in thousands of events over the years.
Prince William, who is the flight's patron, also spoke to veterans.

Veteran Rusty Waughman, 94, who was a Lancaster pilot from 1943 to 1944, spoke to Prince William.
He said he was 20 when he first piloted a Lancaster bomber.
He said 101 Squadron, which performed radio counter-measure duties, had a 60% "attrition rate".
"To survive, we were very fortunate," he said.
The Battle of Britain was the German air force's attempt to gain air superiority over the RAF.
Their ultimate failure was one of the turning points of World War II and prevented Germany from invading Britain.
