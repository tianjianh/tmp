[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Police have been sent a letter claiming a man who has been missing for three weeks is dead.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Chris May, 28, was last seen at his home in Kelvedon, Essex, on 25 May. His Volkswagen Golf was found abandoned in the village of Fairstead.
A letter sent by Royal Mail to Witham police station stated Mr May was the victim of an assault which led to his death.
Essex Police said the author might have "vital information" about the case.
Det Ch Insp Marina Ericson said she was treating the investigation to find Mr May as seriously as though it were a murder investigation.
"My enquiries surrounding this letter have unfortunately not been able to determine its author," she said.
"I have been able to establish that some of the content is inaccurate but the author may have vital information which could help my team establish what has happened to Chris.
"The more time that passes since Chris was last seen the greater chance there is that he is no longer alive and has come to harm."
The letter was posted inside a white envelope.
