Assistant coach John Winder will take up his responsibilities in France, but Wane says he will communicate from the UK throughout the game.
"I'm gutted, it's the first game I've missed during my time as head coach," said Wane.
Wigan recorded a first Super League win since April when they beat Widnes 28-12 in their most recent fixture on Sunday.
