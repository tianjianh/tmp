Parts of the city have been transformed into war-torn ruins for the next two weeks to shoot scenes for the post-apocalyptic zombie movie.
Pitt's partner, actress Angelina Jolie, and their six children, have also travelled to Scotland.
Filming for World War Z has already taken place at other UK locations.
A cast and crew of about 1,200 people will be shooting scenes in Glasgow's George Square, and other city centre locations.
The film is set in Philadelphia, so false shop fronts will be brought in and American cars will take to the city's streets.
Filming for the Paramount Pictures movie, due for release next year, has already taken place in Valletta in Malta and in Falmouth in Cornwall.
