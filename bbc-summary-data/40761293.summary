[SN]TITLE[SN]
Maidstone United 1-1 Maidenhead United

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Maidenhead salvaged a late 1-1 draw at Maidstone in their first ever National League appearance.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Former Southampton midfielder Harley Willard almost got Jay Saunders' Maidstone tenure off to a flying start, but his long-range shot could only clip the bar after beating Maidenhead goalkeeper Carl Pentney after 14 minutes.
Newly-promoted Maidenhead did well to keep it goalless to the break, but Joe Pigott broke the deadlock for the hosts with a well-placed free-kick from the edge of the area after 51 minutes.
Pigott hit the bar as the hosts threatened to run away with it in the second half, but Sam Barratt headed home the equaliser from a corner with two minutes remaining.
