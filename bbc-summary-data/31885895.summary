The unveiling of the 9ft (2.7m) bronze statue marks 100 years since Gandhi returned to India from South Africa to begin his struggle for independence.
The Gandhi Statue Memorial Trust raised more than Â£1m for the work which was described as a "magnificent tribute".
The statue was unveiled by Indian finance minister, Shri Arun Jaitley, in a ceremony which also involved Gandhi's grandson, Gopalkrishna Gandhi.
British sculptor, Philip Jackson, was commissioned to create the work with his previous pieces including statues of the Queen Mother and Bomber Command.
He said he was inspired by photographs of the civil rights leader outside 10 Downing Street on a visit in 1931.
Prime Minister David Cameron said: "This statue is a magnificent tribute to one of the most towering figures in the history of world politics and by putting Mahatma Gandhi in this famous square we are giving him an eternal home in our country."
Gandhi was known for his use of non-violent protest and undertook various hunger strikes to protest against the oppression of India's poorest classes.
