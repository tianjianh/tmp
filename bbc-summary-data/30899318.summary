The Irish vessel Iuda Naofa got into difficulty at about 11:00 when it started taking on water about 48 miles (77km) off the Butt of Lewis.
Stornoway Coastguard helicopter dropped a salvage pump to the crew, but the boat became swamped and started to sink.
Two crewmen were then airlifted to another boat and three to hospital.
The three have been treated at Western Isles Hospital for hypothermia.
The fishing boat has sunk.
Coastguard duty watch manager Paul Tunstall said: "The weather conditions on scene were very rough seas with southerly force 6 winds, evacuating the five crew swiftly and safely before the vessel went down was a great achievement."
The coastguard agency has posted a video of the rescue.
