The 23-year-old returns to the Glovers less than six months after signing for City, having made just two appearances at the Academy Stadium.
Wilshire was Yeovil's top scorer in 2014 with 11 goals in 16 appearances.
"I am looking forward to being back at Yeovil, they are a club with a lot of ambition," she told the club's website.
"Jamie (Sherwood) knows how to get the best out of players and has put a strong squad together who are competing at the top of the table. He is a good coach so it will be a good to be working with him", she added.
