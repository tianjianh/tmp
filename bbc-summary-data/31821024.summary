The Department for Energy and Climate Change approved the plant after a recommendation by the Planning Inspectorate.
It will provide electricity for up to two million homes, according to developer Electricity Supply Board.
ESB said it would create more than 1,000 construction jobs and around 50 permanent posts.
Construction is expected to begin in 2017, with operation starting in 2020.
