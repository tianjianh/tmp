Election 2015: Greens 'will keep the Tories out'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Greens have launched an "MP pledge card" on the last day of the election campaign that promises to "keep out the Tories and keep Labour in line".

Leader Natalie Bennett said the Greens offered British people "a chance to vote for real change".
Green candidates are standing in 571 seats - up from the 335 contested in 2010 - yet the party has only one MP, Caroline Lucas, in Brighton Pavilion.
Ms Bennett insisted that her party will "stand up for what matters".
She spoke out ahead of a visit to a Bristol food distribution centre with cook and blogger Jack Monroe, who has switched her allegiance from Labour to the Greens.

"In less than 24 hours, people in Britain have a chance to vote for real change and to elect more Green MPs into the House of Commons," Ms Bennett said.
"Those Green MPs will do all they can to keep out the Tories, and they'd hold a Labour minority government to account on issues like austerity, climate change and investment in our health service."
Ms Bennett, on the campaign trail with Darren Hall, her party's candidate in Bristol West, was critical of the fact so many people were having to resort to using food banks. A list of the candidates standing in Bristol West can be found here.
"One of the defining issues of this election is the gaping gap between rich and poor in this country," she said.
"We have 147 billionaires in the same country where one million people need food banks to feed their families.
"Only the Greens are putting forward the bold solutions we desperately need to tackle inequality in Britain.
"That means a living wage of Â£10 an hour by 2020, a welfare state that truly supports people and a tax system which ensures that the richest individuals and largest corporations pay their fair share," added Ms Bennett, who is standing in Holborn and St Pancras.
The Green Party has 62,000 members and is the third largest political party in England and Wales.
