[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Eighth seed David Ferrer has pulled out of Wimbledon with an elbow injury.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
He was set to play Britain's James Ward, 28, in the first round, but will be replaced by a lucky loser from qualifying, Italy's Luca Vanni.
World number seven Ferrer, 33, reached the quarter-finals at SW19 in 2013.
His exit opens up the draw for Rafael Nadal, who could have faced his fellow Spaniard in the fourth round, with a potential quarter-final against Britain's Andy Murray for the winner.
Wimbledon begins on Monday, with defending men's champion Novak Djokovic opening play on Centre Court against Germany's Philipp Kohlschreiber at 13:00 BST.
