The auction for the 20-over franchise competition is scheduled to be held in Bangalore, India in late February.
When asked how much Stokes was worth, Yuvraj, who went for a record Â£1.6m in 2015, said: "A couple of million.
"He's a quality hitter, fast bowler and fielder. He'll definitely get the big bucks. He brings a lot to the table."
Yuvraj, 35, has lined up against Stokes, 25, in the recent one-day and Twenty20 series between India and England, and has enjoyed watching England's talisman close up.

"I always see Ben and Virat [Kohli] having a go at each other," Yuvraj told BBC Sport. "It's great for cricket to have passion.
"We always have banter with the English. My old battles were with Andrew Flintoff."
This year the IPL will run from 5 April to 21 May, with England's players available for much more of the tournament than usual because of the lack of a Test match in May.
This availability, coupled with eye-catching performances in limited-overs cricket, mean England's players could be highly sought.
Sam Billings and Jos Buttler are already signed to teams, but the likes of Stokes, Chris Woakes, Jason Roy, Chris Jordan, Tymal Mills and Alex Hales could attract interest.
"If these guys come and play the IPL, their skills will improve," Yuvraj added. "The more they play in different conditions, the better they will become."
Stokes could become the subject of a "bidding war", according to freelance T20 journalist Freddie Wilde.
Wilde believes Kolkata Knight Riders may target the Durham player now West Indies all-rounder Andre Russell is suspended following a doping code violation.
However, he might not be the only player to swell his bank balance.
"Jason Roy could be hot property at this auction too," said Wilde.
"Over the past year, Roy has established himself as one of the leading opening batsmen in the world and his form in the England-India ODI series, as well as the World T20 last year, proves he can do it in Indian conditions.
"Tymal Mills is the most likely of the England bowlers to be picked up. High pace is valuable in India, where the pitches generally offer little in the way of lateral movement to seamers.
"I also think Chris Woakes could prove to be a useful, perhaps under-valued, acquisition for somebody."

The IPL had a television audience of 347 million in India last year, with more than a third of that believed to be female viewers.
"It's quite simply one of the biggest tournaments in the world - not just in cricket," said Isa Guha, a former England women's international who is now an IPL commentator and analyst for television.
"All eyes are on it right across the globe because it's where cricket meets entertainment.
"I liken it to a sitcom because families sit down and enjoy it when they get home from work. It's not just father and son. It's wife and daughters too.
"The Indian public buy into the heroes and villains. AB de Villiers, for example, is revered. They'd be excited to see Ben Stokes play in the IPL."
