Jamie Roberts hopes Wales maintain their record of winning high stakes games against England when they meet in the Six Nations Championship.

The 29-year-old Harlequins centre thinks the winners will go on to win the tournament and that Wales have a proven record of coming out on top.
"The stakes are high this week, there's no doubt about that," he said.
"And when I look back over the moments when the stakes have been highest we've delivered as a group."
Roberts, who lines up in an unchanged Wales side, highlighted the 2013 Grand Slam decider in Cardiff when Wales beat England 30-3 and last September's Pool A match in the World Cup when they triumphed 28-25 in Twickenham.
"Certainly, it's an experienced group and we go to Twickenham knowing what it takes to win there and we have to deliver," he added.
"It's 80 minutes. We get it right we win, we get it wrong we lose; so we know what's on the line, the stakes are high.
"And that high pressure environment certainly brings out the best of us."
England go into the game with a 100% record under new coach Eddie Jones, while Wales have beaten Scotland and France after drawing their opening game 16-16 in Ireland.
If England win they face a trip to France on 19 France chasing a first Grand Slam since 2003. A win for Wales would see them needing to beat Italy at home to win the championship.
"We won't leave any stone unturned in our preparation and it's amazing everything boils down to 80 minutes," said Roberts.
"It will take bodies on the line and full concentration because one missed tackle, one break, one unforced error or one penalty could decide the championship.
"Because if you fast forward a week and I'd like to think we won't lose at home to Italy, which we never have done, and I doubt England will lose in France if they're hunting for the Grand Slam.
"So this game will go a long way towards deciding the championship."
At Harlequins Roberts plays alongside Chris Robshaw, who lost the captaincy of England in the fall-out following the World Cup failure which the defeat against Wales instigated.
Coach Stuart Lancaster also lost his job following the tournament along with the bulk of the coaching team.
And Roberts is full of admiration for the way the team has recovered from adversity under Jones.
"It's a credit to Chris as a bloke the way he's been able to bounce back, especially after the flack he took personally at the World Cup and if anything he's playing some of his best rugby now.
"And that's a credit to the bloke more than the player.
"Full respected to England, they've come back very strong.
"Ultimately after going through a tough time like that as a side they're probably at their most dangerous, as we've seen.
"They are unbeaten - they're three from three and we'll be facing a very determined England side on Saturday."
