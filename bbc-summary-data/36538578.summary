Bell, 19, made three first-team appearances for Dale in addition to loan spells at Chester and Droylsden.
He follows former Forest Green striker Reece Styche among the Tynesiders forward imports this summer.
"Nyal is a young, athletic striker who is prepared to work hard and willing to learn to go on to the next level," assistant manager Lee Nogan said.
