The Portaferry athlete was well placed before falling back in the last 200m as she clocked 4:08.07 in a race won by Kenyan Faith Chepngetich Kipyegon.
"I am sorry I didn't deliver," said Mageean on her Facebook page
"I will make one promise. This is the beginning, this season is only the start. I will be back and I will be stronger."
She added: My dream is to be on a podium, watch the Tri colour rise and Amhr√°n na bhFiann echo through the stadium.
"I will work tirelessly until I achieve this, that is my promise.
"I cannot say how thankful I am for all the support I have been given this summer.
"Messages from the length and breadth of Ireland and further afield has lifted me this entire season.
"Seeing flags and posters in Portaferry and all the kind messages from everyone. Thank you so much truly from the bottom of my heart."
Mageean impressed in coming second in her heat in a time of 4:11.51 but even going three seconds quicker in the semi-final was not enough to progress.
Only the top five in the race were guaranteed a spot in the Olympic final.
Kipyegon won in 4:03.95 with Ethiopia's Dawit Seyaum second and Shannon Rowbury of the United States in third.
Mageean was 17th fastest overall from the two semi-finals.
