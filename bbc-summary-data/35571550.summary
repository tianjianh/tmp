His side bounced back from the 16-16 draw in Ireland to beat Scotland 27-23 in Cardiff.
After France, Wales face England at Twickenham on 12 March before hosting Italy in Cardiff.
"If we can beat France then you're potentially playing England for the Championship," said Gatland.
"That's what it boils down to. That's taking nothing away from Italy in the last game, but if we win the next two the motivation will be there against Italy at home.
"But one step at a time."
Wales, who have won their last four matches against France, trailed until the 65th minute against Vern Cotter's Scotland team before tries from Jamie Roberts and George North broke the visitors' resistance.
The New Zealander singled out man of the match Roberts and winger North for special praise after their match-winning exploits.
"We had a couple of chances and we took those chances," he added.
"Jamie Roberts was man of the match and deserved to be, and we saw something special from George North too.
"Sometimes you need that in games, you need someone to do something special for you.
"It was a tough game - we had to dig deep and we had to grind out a victory.
"We had to use everything we had in the tank with the six day turnaround it was tough as well."
Gatland also praised the impact of the substitutes, with Gethin Jenkins, Bradley Davies and Dan Lydiate - all with more than 50 caps to their names - helping Wales see out the win.
Roberts says Wales need to produce a markedly improved performance to beat France.
"In every facet, we need to improve our defence certainly, we need to improve our attack," Roberts told BBC Wales Sport.
"But we did some good stuff, and we need to look at the positives, improve on the positives, and the negatives as well."
Roberts' midfield partner Jonathan Davies says the Harlequins centre's efforts are a barometer for Wales' performances.
"Jamie's showing great form at the moment - in a rich vein of form - and when he plays well, we play well we normally get the result," said Davies.
