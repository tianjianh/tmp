BBC Generation 2016: Young voters step up to election debate

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The BBC's Generation projects are designed to ensure the voices of younger people are heard in BBC programmes and content around elections and political events.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
With both a referendum on EU membership and a broad set of elections UK-wide, 2016 is a huge year for democracy.
As such, it is more important than ever that young people step up to be involved in discussions about what direction we should take.
BBC Generation 2016 is focused on elections in Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland, to the Northern Ireland Assembly, the Welsh Assembly, and the Scottish Parliament.
All three institutions go back to legislation passed in 1998: the Good Friday Agreement in Northern Ireland, the Government of Wales Act, and the Scotland Act.
Many 18-year-olds voting for the first time in an election in Wales, Scotland or Northern Ireland were born in that year, and have lived almost entirely under devolved government.
BBC Referendum Generation running concurrently, is a broad ranging group of young people, from the whole of the UK and across Europe, who we have brought together to discuss the UK's place in the European Union.
We have voices drawn from a range of diverse backgrounds and communities.
They'll appear across a range of BBC output, discussing the issues above, or talking more broadly about life as a young person today.
The BBC Generations team is delighted to be able to bring these young voices to the heart of UK debate.
