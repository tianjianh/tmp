Evelyn Amony was abducted by the rebel when she was 12, and spent 11 years in their camp.
She was also forced to became Mr Kony's wife and had three children with him.
For nearly three decades, the LRA has committed many atrocities - abducting children and forcing the boys to become fighters and keeping the girls as sex slaves.
Mr Kony, who is still at large, is wanted by the International Criminal Court (ICC) on war crimes charges.
Ms Amony now works with other war-affected women in northern Uganda, and has published a book: I Am Evelyn Amony: Reclaiming My Life from the Lord's Resistance Army.
She has been telling the story of her abduction, escape and the violent life around her to the BBC World Update's Dan Damon.
