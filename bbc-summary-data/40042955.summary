George Groves is unsure if his career would recover if he fails to land a world title at the fourth attempt.

The 29-year-old fights Russian Fedor Chudinov for the vacant WBA super-middleweight crown on Saturday.
Groves' only three defeats in his 28-fight career have come when contesting world titles.
"I know it's a long road back after a loss in a world title fight, I couldn't bear to go through that again," Groves said.
The Londoner suffered two defeats at the hands of compatriot Carl Froch before losing again to American Badou Jack in 2015.
"It's the fourth time and I can't bear to come out without the win," Groves said. "I'm a better fighter than I was in those previous attempts, better prepared. I think I've learned a lot from them and that will help me on Saturday night."
Groves noticeably ended his public workout quickly on Wednesday and he and his team swiftly left Sheffield's Peace Gardens as they focus on what appears a career-defining fight at Bramall Lane, home of the city's Sheffield United football team.
Two stoppage defeats by Froch in 2014 and a loss in Las Vegas to Jack three fights later left the Briton's career in disarray. He has rebuilt admirably having scored four wins since parting with trainer Paddy Fitzpatrick to join forces with Shane McGuigan.
Chudinov, 29, lost the WBA title to Felix Sturm last year before the German vacated the strap which will be on the line. He has had just 15 fights in eight years, 13 less than Groves who has been a professional for seven months longer.
Many commentators believe this is the best chance of Groves' nine-year career and he starts as odds-on favourite with bookmakers.
"It will mean the absolute world," added the Hammersmith fighter. "I know the pressure is on.
"We've had a great camp, I'm sure this will be my time. He's competed at the highest level but is relatively inexperienced. We may not know the best Chudinov yet."
Groves and Chudinov compete in a co-main event as Sheffield's Kell Brook also defends his IBF world welterweight title against American Errol Spence on the card.
