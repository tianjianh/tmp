The Metropolitan Police said a man in his 90s was interviewed under caution after agreeing to attend a police station near Farnham, Surrey.
He spent nearly two hours at the police station during which he answered questions. He was not arrested.
Lord Bramall told the BBC he had no comment to make.
The 91-year-old was questioned as part of Operation Midland.
It is examining allegations that boys were abused by a group of powerful men from politics, the military and law enforcement agencies at locations across southern England and in London in the 1970s and 1980s.
It has focused on the Dolphin Square estate in Pimlico, south-west London.
Scotland Yard said Lord Bramall would not be subject to any police bail conditions.
Following a search of his house in March, Lord Bramall said: "Categorically, never have I had a connection or anything to do with the matters being investigated.
"It is not in my character or my psyche."
Allegations he was involved in child abuse were "absolutely a load of rubbish", he added at the time.
A field marshal and baron, Lord Bramall served during the Normandy landings and commanded UK land forces between 1976 and 1978.
He become chief of the general staff - the professional head of the Army - in 1979, and in 1982 he oversaw the Falklands campaign.
Later that year he became chief of the defence staff  - the most senior officer commanding the UK's armed forces.
