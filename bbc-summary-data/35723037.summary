Jamaica has sworn in a new Prime Minister, Andrew Holness.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A former education minister, he has promised to create jobs, boost the economy and improve education and healthcare.
His party, the Jamaican Labour Party will have a slim one-seat majority in parliament.
He beat Portia Simpson Miller, Jamaica's first female head of government in elections last week.
He was sworn in by the Governor-General of Jamaica, Sir Patrick Allen.
Among the challenges for Jamaica's new government is a youth unemployment rate of 38% and dealing with the country's heavy debt.
In his inaugural address, Mr Holness said he wanted to make Jamaica "the centre of the Caribbean" for finance, trade, commerce, arts and culture.
"My dream is to fulfil your dream. We must create a Jamaica where there is hope and opportunity, where we can encourage our children to dream big."
