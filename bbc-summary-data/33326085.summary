Isle of Wight Council says it is introducing the 40p return charge for the Cowes Floating Bridge in "response to the national austerity agenda".
The charge, which will begin on 20 July, was agreed by councillors in February, despite protests and a social media campaign.
Motorists already pay between Â£1.30 and Â£7.50 to use the crossing.
Travel will continue to be free for concessionary bus pass holders and under-19s but other users will pay 40p for a return trip.
Tickets will initially be available from ferry staff but a mechanised system will be introduced in February 2016, the council said.
A smartcard-style system will be launched later this year and those not obtaining a smartcard will have to pay 70p return.
Isle of Wight Council has implemented Â£14.5m of budget cuts for 2015-16.
Economy and tourism councillor Shirley Smart said: "It is well known that the council is under severe financial pressures and we must do all we can to raise income from services for which we do not have a statutory requirement to provide."
The 38-year-old ferry linking Cowes and East Cowes, known as Cowes Floating Bridge, is due to be replaced.
The council said the charges would help fund the new vessel.
The service has been in operation since 1859.
