Cleft palate surgeries to be centralised

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Plans to centralise cleft palate and lip surgeries in Glasgow have been approved by the Scottish government.

The move will mean the closure of surgical services in Edinburgh for the condition, which affects 100 babies born in Scotland every year.
Campaigners against the proposal said it would make life more difficult for families on the east coast.
But Health Secretary Shona Robison insisted it would ensure a "safe and sustainable service" for patients.
Surgery can help babies born with cleft lips or palates to eat and talk when they are older, with Scotland currently having two clinics - in Edinburgh and Glasgow - which specialise in the procedure.
Ms Robison said the two expert surgical teams would now work together as a single team, with all cleft surgery now performed at the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital in Glasgow.
The new services will start early next year, with a transition period of six months towards a single surgical team.
It will only apply to surgical procedures, with no reduction in the number of local outreach clinics.
The wider teams involved in cleft care including speech therapy, orthodontists, ENT surgeons and paediatric dentistry will also continue to be delivered locally.
The recommendation from NHS board chief executives and experts has been accepted following a review into the current set-up.
Ms Robison said: "We will have cleft surgeons working alongside one another and sharing best practice and knowledge, with an even distribution of surgical procedures, which means patients will get the treatment they need when they need it.
"In any scenario like this it's important to spend time listening to patients, families, stakeholders and experts, which is what I have done, so we can come to a fully informed decision that is in the best interests of cleft patients."
Supporters of a 6,200-signature petition opposing the move staged a protest outside Holyrood ahead of a parliamentary debate on the issue in September.
Conservative MSP Miles Briggs, who backed the campaigners, said the centralisation decision was "one of the worst decisions regarding our health service this SNP government has taken".
He added: "Ministers have completely failed to listen to the views of clinicians, patients and campaigners and have made the wrong decision.
"The Edinburgh surgical unit is led by an internationally renowned surgeon and the audited outcomes it achieves for babies and children are among the best, if not the best, in the whole of the UK. The health secretary's decision now risks the loss of all of this."
Dr David Stokes, chief executive of the Cleft Lip and Palate Association (Clapa), said he was pleased a decision had been made following a "considerable period of uncertainty" for parents and patients.
And he said he was confident that the surgical teams involved will continue to provide first-class care to everyone born with a cleft in Scotland.
Dr Stokes added: "Many people have valid concerns about what these changes might mean for them and their families, and it is important that these are addressed directly.
"We urge NHS Scotland to work with Clapa and the cleft community to ensure that everyone impacted by this change is well supported, both during the transition period and beyond, and that their voices are taken into account now just as they were throughout the lengthy consultation process.
