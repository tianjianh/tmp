Four men admit role in kidnap of cattle dealer near Omagh

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Four County Tyrone men have admitted involvement in the kidnapping of a cattle dealer who was held captive for five days as part of an extortion plot.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The victim travelled to Northern Ireland in 2012 on the pretext of viewing a meat factory.
He was tied up, hooded and bundled into a van by an armed gang near Omagh. A ransom of 400,000 euros (Â£342,000) was then demanded from the man's father.
He was released across the Irish border after 100,000 euros (Â£85,000) was paid.
The man had been accompanied on his trip to Northern Ireland by Robert Vevers, 59, from Crawick in Dumfries, Scotland.
He pleaded guilty at an earlier hearing to kidnapping, false imprisonment and blackmail.
Four other men appeared at Dungannon Crown Court on Wednesday.
Patrick McCaul, 44, from Slieveard Rise in Omagh and Matthew McLean, 27, from Glenpark Road in Omagh each pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit blackmail.
Robert McLean, 22, from Deverney Park, Omagh and Martin Arkinson, 21, from Ballycolman Estate, Strabane, entered guilty pleas to assisting offenders.
The charge stated that they had bought food and telephone top-up cards to assist in the blackmail.
All four had been due to face trial on charges of conspiracy to kidnap, conspiracy to commit blackmail and conspiring to falsely imprison.
The prosecution applied for the remaining charges to be left on the books.
Sentencing was adjourned until 20 January 2017.
