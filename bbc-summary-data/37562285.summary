Five Powys recycling and waste centres' futures uncertain

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The futures of five waste and recycling centres are being reviewed as part of a council's efforts to save money.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
People in Powys are being consulted on the centres in Brecon, Llandegley, Newtown, Welshpool and Ystradgynlais, and two could close.
Powys council withdrew its bulky waste collection service in Machynlleth in August after shutting the Potters Yard centre in January 2015.
The council needs to save £700,000 from the service from April 2017.
In August, the council said Machynlleth householders would have to take their waste to Newtown, a 60-mile round trip, or pay £25 for collection - but the Newtown centre's future is now also uncertain.
Other options include reducing the opening days of the sites, and potential charges for some waste.
The council said it faced "difficult decisions".
