The boy, who is in his mid-teens, approached the girl on a cycle path in South Queensferry at about 14:00 on Friday.
The girl immediately went home and told her parents what had happened.
Officers said it was a "deeply concerning incident" that had caused great distress to the girl.
The teenager left on foot shortly after the incident, which took place behind the South Queensferry Bowling Club.
He walked east in the direction of Newhalls Road and may have been seen by several drivers in the area.
Police described him as white, about 5ft 4ins, of a medium build with brown hair brushed forward. He was wearing a royal blue round neck t-shirt, navy jeans and was possibly carrying an old black and blue rucksack.
Det Insp Julie Marshall said: "This is a deeply concerning incident that has caused a great deal of distress to the young victim as well as her family.
"She has shown tremendous courage and has been able to supply us with a very strong description of the suspect and I urge anyone who has relevant information to contact police immediately."
She added: "Our inquiries are ongoing but I can reassure the public that we will use all resources at our disposal to trace this individual as quickly as possible."
