Property sales dive on stamp duty changes, says HMRC

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The number of UK properties sold fell by 45% between March and April, HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) figures show, as changes to stamp duty began.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
In total 94,370 properties changed hands in April, down from the record high of 164,400 transactions in March.
HMRC said March had seen a rush to buy properties before the higher rate of stamp duty on second homes came in on 1 April.
Since then landlords and buyers of second homes have had to pay 3% extra.
The number of residential properties sold in April - 84,280 - was the lowest for three years.
Compared to April last year, the number of transactions was down by 14.5%.
