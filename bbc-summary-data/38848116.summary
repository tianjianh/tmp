Education Secretary John Swinney did not get an unredacted copy of the report into the death of Aberdeen schoolboy Bailey Gwynne.

Bailey, 16, was stabbed during a fight with a fellow pupil at Cults Academy.
His killer is serving nine years for culpable homicide.
Mr Swinney said on Tuesday the Scottish government is to push for a UK-wide crackdown on the sale of knives online. However it has emerged the report provided to him was redacted.
A review of the death made a series of recommendations, one of which was for the government to seek "further legislative controls" on the sale of weapons online.
The review, by child welfare professional Andrew Lowe, made 21 recommendations.
The review found the pupil's death was "potentially avoidable" and said the Scottish government should consider legal changes to give teachers more power to search pupils and to crack down on online knife sales.
The heavily-redacted report into the killing was published last year.
This was said to be on the grounds of "data protection laws and respect the wishes of the individuals and families involved".
The Scottish government said on Thursday: "We have not been provided with an unredacted copy of the report by Aberdeen City Council and have focused on the recommendations directed to us.
"Officials sought views and advice from a key range of stakeholders including all teaching unions in Scotland, the Association of Directors of Education in Scotland and the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities.
"Feedback was also sought from a range of other stakeholders including Police Scotland, the national Violence Reduction Unit, Medics Against Violence and the National Parent Forum of Scotland."
A spokesperson for Aberdeen City Council said: "We have worked closely with the Scottish government following the publication of the report and have provided everything requested, including the full findings."
Mr Swinney rejected another recommendation to give teachers a statutory power to search pupils without permission.
Mr Swinney said this would "place teachers on the same footing as police officers" and "radically change the pupil-teacher relationship".
The Educational Institute of Scotland (EIS) welcomed the announcement.
