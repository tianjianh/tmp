[SN]TITLE[SN]
Bolton Wanderers 2-0 Millwall

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Millwall's wait for a first league win at Bolton since 1968 goes on after goals from Josh Vela and substitute Tom Thorpe completed a 2-0 League One success for high-flying Wanderers.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Victory also earned a quick-fire league double for Phil Parkinson's impressive side after a carbon copy win at The Den on October 18.
Midfielder Vela's fourth goal of the season after 17 minutes set-up the Trotters for a first win in three outings.
Zach Clough, denied by goalkeeper Jordan Archer, and skipper Jay Spearing, with a header against the crossbar, went close to doubling Bolton's advantage before half-time.
Liam Trotter, booked early on, also had a goal disallowed for offside.
And 12 minutes after the break Thorpe opened his account for Bolton by heading home from Spearing's inswinging corner.
Millwall's tame surrender of their five-match winning streak in all competitions included a game-ending first-half injury for striker Lee Gregory.
