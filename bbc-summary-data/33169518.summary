Paul Lewis was leaving rehearsals with the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra when he was startled, causing him to fall and sprain a finger.
The 43-year-old musician had been due to play in two performances but has had to pull out, the orchestra confirmed.
A spokesperson said they wished him "a speedy recovery".
Head of communications Jayne Garrity said: "Unfortunately, Paul Lewis has had to withdraw from his concerts this week with the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra.
"On leaving rehearsals with the orchestra earlier this week, Paul sustained an injury, spraining one of the fingers on his right hand, after a seagull which had been nesting close by, swooped close to his head, causing him to stumble."
Mr Lewis was the first pianist to perform a complete Beethoven piano concerto cycle in a season during the 2010 BBC Proms.
He has also performed with symphony orchestras in London, New York and Salzburg.
The orchestra added that pianist Finghin Collins has stepped in at short notice to play and direct in concerts of Mozart's Piano Concerto No.12 and Schumann's Piano Concerto.
Mozart's Eine kleine Nachtmusik and Mendelssohn's String Symphony No.2 in D will be directed by the Orchestra's joint leader, Thelma Handy.
Mr Lewis was born in Liverpool, where seagulls are a common sight.
