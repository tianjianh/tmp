Real Madrid loan Martin Odegaard to Heerenveen

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Real Madrid have sent Norway attacking midfielder Martin Odegaard on an 18-month loan to Dutch side Heerenveen.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Odegaard joined Real in a high-profile move as a 16-year-old from Stromsgodset two years ago, having been a target for most of Europe's top sides, including Manchester United and Liverpool.
But he has only played twice for Real's first team, scoring five goals in 62 third-tier games for their B team.
He made his senior Norway debut at the age of 15, and has won nine caps.
