North Wales Police has launched Operation Darwen, a campaign to cut the number of motorcycle-related deaths.
Figures have shown motorcyclists make up just 1% of road traffic but account for 18% of all fatalities.
Last year there were 108 motorcyclists killed or seriously injured on north Wales' roads compared with 71 in 2013.
Police said that there has been an emerging trend in motorcyclists who drive after drinking alcohol or taking drugs.
Until early autumn officers in north Wales will be checking tyres on motorcycles.
Ch Insp Darren Wareing said: "Whilst the vast majority of motorcyclists ride appropriately, some riders choose to use the roads as a racetrack.
"We want them to enjoy the roads but most of all we want them to ride safely and responsibly."
