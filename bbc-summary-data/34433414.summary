Tandy's team were beaten 20-9 by Edinburgh and remain without a win.
The Welsh region are without 20 players through either injury or World Cup duty.
"A lot of these guys are learning. It's a tough place to come when you look at the experience in the Edinburgh team," he said.
"It's something the boys are going to have to go through to understand what it takes to win away from home.
"Ultimately it wasn't good enough."
Ospreys were Wales' higher placed team in last season's Pro 12 but are yet to score a try this campaign.
Their next game sees them travel to Italy to face Treviso on Saturday, 17 October.
