Keziah Flux-Edmonds was discovered lying next to the bodies of her father, Darren Flux-Edmonds, 44, and two dogs in East Cowes on Wednesday.
She was taken to St Mary's Hospital in Newport but died a short time later.
More than 200 neighbours, family and school friends gathered at the home in Cromwell Avenue, on Thursday evening.
As flowers, toys and candles were laid outside the house, Keziah's favourite song "Roar" by Katy Perry was played.
Pupils and teachers at Keziah's school, Queensgate Foundation Primary, will be offered support after the half term holiday.
Family friend, Lucie McMahon said: "How do you explain it to five and six-year-olds?  The best way you can explain it is that she's gone to the stars."
Hampshire Constabulary said Keziah's mother was being supported by specialist officers.
Isle of Wight councillor Julia Baker-Smith, who lives nearby, said: "We're absolutely shocked and saddened.
"The whole community is grief-stricken, by what's happened."
Investigations into the exact circumstances of the deaths are ongoing.
