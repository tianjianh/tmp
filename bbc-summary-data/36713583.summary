The 27-year-old, who has signed a five-year contract, is Palace's third summer signing, after midfielder Andros Townsend and goalkeeper Steve Mandanda.
Tomkins joined West Ham's academy aged seven and went on to make 243 first-team appearances, scoring 11 goals.
Palace chairman Steve Parish said Tomkins was a player that manager Alan Pardew had "always wanted to sign".
Tomkins said on the club's website: "I am really excited to be joining Crystal Palace, a massive club and a manager in Alan Pardew that I know well.
"I will always be thankful for how he helped me develop in my younger days at Upton Park."
