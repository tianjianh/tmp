Right-arm seamer Wheal, 20, and leg-spinner Crane, 19, will both stay at the Ageas Bowl until the end of 2019.
Wheal took 20 County Championship wickets last season, with Crane claiming 31 in Division One.
"Both showed last season what important parts of our squad they are moving forward," director of cricket Giles White told BBC Radio Solent.
Wheal - who made his Scotland debut earlier this year - and Crane follow fellow academy products Tom Alsop and Lewis McManus in agreeing longer-term deals with Hampshire.
"It was a difficult season for us last year for a number of reasons," White added. "But, the one positive is that our younger players got the opportunity to show us what they could do.
"These contract extensions are good news for the club and the young players involved. Next year, they'll be plenty of competition for places."
Hampshire will stay in Division One of the Championship next summer after being reprieved following the England and Wales Cricket Board's decision to demote Durham over financial issues.
