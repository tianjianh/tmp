Jenna Barbour, 18, David Armstrong, 15, and Josh Stewart, 16, from Dunbar, were killed when their car hit a wall at 20:20 on Monday in Tyninghame.
Robbie Gemmell, 16, is being treated at Edinburgh Royal Infirmary. Police have appealed for witnesses to come forward.
They were in a Peugeot 206 which left the road. Jenna had left Dunbar Grammar School after completing sixth year.
The three male teenagers were all 5th year pupils at the school.
Jenna's mother Sandra, her father Drew and brother Gregor, said: "We have been left completely devastated by the death of our beloved Jenna, who was a dearly loved daughter, sister and friend.
"Having only recently left school, Jenna had her whole life in front of her and had been saving for a trip to New Zealand, which was her dream holiday.
"Jenna had been working extremely hard to save for the trip and when she wasn't busy working at her part-time jobs, she loved horse riding and was very accomplished at the sport.
"As well as regularly spending time practising, Jenna also volunteered with the Riding for the Disabled charity.
"We were all immensely proud of Jenna and everything she achieved in her life. She was always a delight to be around and the family each have very fond memories of our holidays together.
"To lose someone as special as Jenna has left a huge hole in our hearts."
David's mother Andrea said: "Our family is still in a state of complete shock following David's death and we are struggling to come to terms with our loss.
"David was a kind-hearted and good-mannered boy, who was always respectful of adults and his peers and was a loving brother to his sister.
"He was athletic, enjoyed playing computer games and had a cheeky wink that made him such a wonderful person to know.
"We are grateful for all the kind words of support we're receiving at this time and would like to thank our family and friends for their condolences."
Josh's parents Susan and Mark said: "Josh was a much loved son, nephew, grandson and cousin, and a loyal friend.
"He was a joy to anyone who knew him and the people that met Josh and his smile would never forget him.
"Josh lived for rugby and the gym. He was still looking to find that elusive six pack. He will be sorely missed.
"It's time for the community to pull together in this very difficult time. My heart goes out to all families involved at this time of great sadness."
