[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Lt Daniel Clack, of 1st Battalion The Rifles, died as he led a foot patrol in the Shaparak area of the Nahr-e Saraj district of Helmand province.
The family of the engaged 24-year-old from north London said he was "brave" and would be "forever missed".
A total of 379 UK troops have died in Afghan military operations since 2001.
Five of Lt Clack's comrades were also injured in the explosion, which took place 150 metres from the entrance to the checkpoint he commanded.
The MoD said Lt Clack had become "immensely popular" with his Riflemen and was known as a "man of integrity".
After graduating from Exeter University, he worked in Switzerland as driver for a ski chalet company, before joining the Army in May 2009.
He was commissioned from Sandhurst into The Rifles in 2010, and had served with C Company as 8 Platoon Commander since his arrival in Afghanistan in April this year.
Described as a keen sportsman, Lt Clack represented both Sandhurst and his battalion at rugby.
Lt Clack's family said: "Dan was a brave Rifleman and he died doing the only profession he ever considered. He loved leading his Riflemen and was so proud to be an officer in the British Army.
"There are no words to describe our loss. He will be forever missed by his mother, father, brother, fiancee and all those who knew him. He will always be in our hearts."
Lt Clack's commanding officer, Lt Col James de Labilliere, said he had "demonstrated a courage and bravery that was profound and inspiring".
He added: "His parting has come too soon, by far. Dan had so much to give, so much to look forward to and so many opportunities ahead of him. The Rifles has been denied one of our best, and a professional commander for the future has been taken from us."
At the time of his death Lt Clack was leading a patrol to the village of Dactran to discuss a meeting of elders planned for the next day.
Major Bill Eden, Officer Commanding C Company, 1 Rifles, said in Nahr-e Saraj that Lt Clack had established a "deep rapport with the population, which continues to grow in recognition of the improvements made to the area".
There were also tributes from his comrades in 8 Platoon.
Acting Serjeant Daniel Field, said he would "miss the energy and enthusiasm he brought to the job" while Acting Serjeant Paul Nancolis said he had given him "great confidence from the type of soldier he was and the type of soldier he could have been".
Lt Michael Evans, from 2nd Battalion The Royal Gurkha Rifles, who knew Lt Clack at Sandhurst, said: "He was always a man you could turn to when you needed a competent pair of hands, balanced with a cheeky comeback. I never knew him sorry for himself, he would rather make a situation his own than worry or wallow."
