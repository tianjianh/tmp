Litvinenko post-mortem 'probably most dangerous ever'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The post-mortem examination of poisoned Russian dissident Alexander Litvinenko was probably "the most dangerous ever undertaken in the Western world", a pathologist has said.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Dr Nathaniel Cary told the inquiry into Mr Litvinenko's death that his body was "very hazardous" and had to be transferred to a secure site for tests.
Mr Litvinenko died from radiation poisoning in a London hospital in 2006.
His death came nearly three weeks after he drank tea laced with polonium.
The former KGB agent had fled to the UK where he became a vocal critic of the Kremlin and worked for the UK intelligence service MI6.
Dr Cary, a Home Office forensic pathologist, said he and his colleagues wore white suits, protective gloves and specialised hoods, which had air pumped into them through a filter, during the post-mortem examination.
He told the inquiry: "It has been described as the most dangerous post-mortem examination ever undertaken in the western world and I think that is probably right."
Dr Cary said Mr Litvinenko had shown signs of multi-organ failure as a result of acute radiation poisoning.
He added: "It appears Mr Litvinenko ingested a large quantity of polonium-210 on or around 1 November 2006, largely if not wholly by oral ingestion, rather than by inhalation.
"The calculated amount absorbed was in far excess of known survivability limits."
There was no precedent for such a case of alpha particle radiation poisoning in the UK, he said.
Earlier, a counter-terrorism officer said two men suspected of killing Mr Litvinenko - Russians Andrei Lugovoi and Dmitry Kovtun - are still wanted by police for murder.
Det Insp Craig Mascall told the inquiry there was an "ongoing criminal investigation".
Mr Lugovoi and Mr Kovtun have both denied involvement.
Det Insp Mascall also told the inquiry that at its peak, 100 detectives and 100 uniformed officers worked on the investigation.
On Tuesday, counsel to the inquiry Robin Tam QC said that Mr Litvinenko may have been poisoned twice.
Mr Litvinenko's widow Marina has said her husband blamed the Kremlin as he lay dying in hospital, but Russia denies any involvement.
The inquiry also heard Mr Lugovoi had given an interview to the Echo of Moscow radio station in response to Tuesday's proceedings.
Ben Emmerson QC, who represents Mr Litvinenko's widow , said Mr Lugovoi had claimed the proceedings were resurrected, after being suspended due to the exclusion of secret material,  in response to the Ukrainian conflict.
Reading a translation of Mr Lugovoi's interview, Mr Emmerson said: "When the situation in Ukraine kicked off and the UK geographical interest... they had decided to dust off the mothballs and commence proceedings."
Mr Lugovoi also said he "couldn't care less about what's happening" in Britain in response to the start of the inquiry, Mr Emmerson added.
