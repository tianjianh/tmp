Jack Marriott slotted in from Olly Lee's pass to give the hosts an early lead before Charlie Wyke levelled just before the break.
Josh McQuoid put the home team back in front immediately after the restart and Danny Green extended the lead with a volley from 20 yards.
Goals by subs Alex Gilliead and Jabo Ibehre got Carlisle back level before Derek Asamoah's low drive won it.
Luton boss John Still told BBC Three Counties Radio:
"I think it was the second goal, we had three defenders on the floor, well you've got no chance of defending if you're on the floor.

"In possession we were terrific, but we've got to defend better.
"Defending's been our Achilles heel this season, I thought we'd got over that and only conceded 1 in 4.
"We've got 3 goals at home and it should be enough, but it wasn't."
