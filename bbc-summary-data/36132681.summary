A "futuristic" crazy golf course could be brought to London's Trafalgar Square after a crowd-funding campaign.

London Design Festival is hoping to raise £120,000 for the Visionary Crazy Golf, which has been dreamed up by artists and designers, including the late Dame Zaha Hadid.
Festival organisers say it will be "futuristic, functional, fun and free for the public to play".
Funding permitted, the golf course will run from 16-22 September.
The dates coincide with the London Design Festival.
Members of the public who pledge funds, from £5 up to £5,000, will receive rewards, including clothes and mugs, by one of the designers.
Organisers have until 6 June to raise the money.
The design teams involved include Mark Wallinger, Tom Dixon, Camille Walala, Ordinary Architecture, HAT Projects, Neon Studio, and Atelier Bow-Wow.
Each will create a miniature art installation, as part of the golf course, with each one making a statement about the future of architecture.
Holes include Tom Dixon's, with its funnel and nest of pneumatic tubes through which golf balls will hurtle; a circuitous maze by Mark Wallinger; and a netted driving range by the Japanese studio Atelier Bow-Wow.
The mayor's office has given permission for the scheme if funding is secured.
