Early Burwash school records lodged in county archive

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Documents thought to be the earliest school records in Sussex have been deposited in county archives.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The two parchment books dating from 1727 record the setting up of Burwash Charity School with a legacy of Â£100 from the Rev George Barnsley.
Other subscribers were Thomas and Henry Pelham and local landowners and businessmen.
The books, which have been in the hands of a local historian, are now being held at The Keep in Brighton.
They cover 150 years up to 1877, recording some of the pupils' names, the teachers and the school accounts.
Two of the first three teachers employed in 1727 were unable to write, and when asked to sign receipts for their wages, could only sign with a line or cross.
"They probably weren't trained at all," said senior archivist Christopher Whittick.
"This was a charity school for poor children."
He said the books would be of interest to many different people.
"If you are interested in education that's the most obvious but if you are interested in Burwash, or the families of Burwash, or if your ancestor was one of the children there is something there for you."
The Keep at Falmer, which opened in 2013, holds the historical records of East Sussex Record Office, Brighton Royal Pavilion and Museums and the University of Sussex.
