The "shout" came during Tuesday's high temperatures, which included 27C in Kinlochewe in the Highlands and 24C more widely across Scotland.
The RNLI volunteers were alerted at 20:06.
Following a search of the coastline of part of the peninsula, the lifeboat crew found the two men.
A spokesman for RNLI Kyle of Lochalsh said: "The men were walking the coast from Toscaig to Kishorn and had gotten into difficulty due to the heat, with one of them also injuring his ankle.
"The lifeboat arrived in Kishorn at 20:25 where the crew began a systematic search of the coastline heading west towards Toscaig.
"The casualties were located two miles west of Kishorn Port and were quickly taken on board the lifeboat to be assessed.
"The casualties were found to be dehydrated and one had slightly injured his ankle, but were otherwise fit and well."
The incident was one of three shouts the lifeboat crew responded to on Tuesday. The others involved a woman who had become unwell and a broken down boat with five people and a dog on board.
