A-22-year-old gamer with cerebral palsy has received a Playstation controller especially adapted for him by a Sony employee.

Peter Byrne contacted the firm as tremors caused by his condition meant he kept hitting the standard controller's touchpad, pausing games.
Alex Nawabi from Sony's marketing team said he would investigate.
He then modified a Dual Shock 4 controller himself and sent it to Mr Byrne as a surprise.
On the bespoke version, the touchpad has been disabled and its button re-routed to the back of the device.
In a letter to Mr Byrne, who lives in New Jersey in the US, Mr Nawabi said it took him around 10 hours and three attempts to create his solution.
He said he had undertaken the work on his own initiative and told Mr Byrne it would not be covered by the warranty.
"I'm not 100% sure how long it will last, as it's the first time I've ever done anything like this," he wrote.
"I have plans to build you one more controller in case this one breaks but I'd like feedback on this one first."
Mr Nawabi added that Mr Byrne's email had "struck a chord" with him.
"It killed me to hear how something you used to enjoy thoroughly was being ruined because of our new controller design," he wrote.
Mr Byrne said he was delighted with his new controller.
"Honestly, I expected them to just make a note of my issue and say 'we'll address this in the future'," he told the BBC.
"It works very good so far. I have no problems and gameplay has been fine".
Mr Byrne's story attracted the attention of local news outlet News12 New Jersey (subscription site) after he posted pictures of the letter and his controller on Facebook and it was shared widely.
Sony has been contacted by the BBC.
