[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Ulster Bank has reported an operating profit of £131m for the first half of 2015.

This is up from £55m for the same period last year.
Chief executive Jim Brown said it showed continued progress for Ulster Bank "as it supports the economic recovery across the island of Ireland".
This was despite being affected by the weakened euro currency, he said.
"We see an increased profit, reduced operating expenses and a continued trend of impairment releases driven by proactive debt management and the improving economic conditions," he said.
Ulster Bank's parent group Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) reported second-quarter net profits of £293m, up 27% on the same quarter in 2014.
