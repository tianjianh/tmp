[SN]TITLE[SN]
Cheltenham Town 2-0 Crewe Alexandra

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
First-half goals from Rob Dickie and James Dayton earned Cheltenham Town their first win since returning to League Two after a one-year absence as they saw off Crewe.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Defender Dickie, who returned to the club on loan from Reading this week, netted the opener as he turned in Dayton's low corner from the right in the 16th minute.
Dayton added the second six minutes later as he seized on a poor pass from Danny Hollands and applied a simple finish past Ben Garratt.
The home side were on top throughout the first half with James Rowe setting Billy Waters up for a good chance against his old club, but he curled his effort wide early on.
Crewe improved after the break without seriously testing Cheltenham goalkeeper Russell Griffiths, who had a quiet afternoon.
Waters sent another effort wide from Amari Morgan-Smith's pass in the 79th minute.
The closest the Alex came to pulling one back was when Callum Ainley's low effort deflected off defender Jordan Cranston and past the right post and Alex Kiwomya had a shot blocked in the six-yard box in the 84th minute.
