Leicester City manager Claudio Ranieri says he held talks about becoming Southampton's boss before he took charge of Greece.

The Foxes travel to St Mary's on Saturday seeking a fifth win in nine league games since Ranieri took charge.
Ranieri said he spoke with the Saints before they appointed current boss Ronald Koeman in June 2014.
"I was interested, but after that there was also the Greece job - and I made a mistake," said the Italian.
Ranieri was appointed Greece manager in July 2014 but presided over three defeats and a draw in Euro 2016 qualifying before being replaced four months later.
The 63-year-old has made a fine start since taking charge of Leicester in July, with the Foxes starting the weekend fifth in the Premier League table, three points behind leaders Manchester City.
