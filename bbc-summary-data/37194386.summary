Manx rider Ryan Kneen set the quickest lap in the Lightweight class at 111.63mph with only Ian Lougher and Anstey having gone faster.
Meanwhile, Isle of Man rider Andrew Dudgeon continued to impress in Manx Grand Prix practice with a lap of 118.96mph - his quickest of the week.
Tom Weedon (118.23mph), Barry Lee Evans (117.26mph) and Glenn Harrison (116.94mph) all improved on their lap times ahead of Wednesday's Junior Manx Grand Prix.
The session was later red flagged following an incident at Churchtown on the approach to Ramsey.
James Bucket was taken by helicopter to Noble's Hospital where he was reported to have fractures.
Clerk of the Course Gary Thompson ended the session after mist descended around the course.
