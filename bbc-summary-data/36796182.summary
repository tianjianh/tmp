Yona Knight-Wisdom, who was born in Leeds, will represent Team Jamaica alongside stars like Usain Bolt.
Knight-Wisdom, 21, will represent his country in the men's 3m springboard.
He recently graduated from Leeds Beckett University after completing a sport and exercise science honours degree.
Speaking to BBC Radio Leeds, he said: "I'm just so excited. The team list was officially announced last week and to see my name as part of the team, along with some amazing athletes, is something I have been dreaming of for a long time."
He began diving in 2004 as part of a talent programme and qualified for the Rio Olympics at the Diving World Cup.
Asked whether he felt there were any expectations representing Jamaica as its first-ever male diver, he said: "I don't think there is any pressure on my shoulders; the pressure was in qualifying in the first place.
"It's now about enjoying the journey as much as possible. I'm just looking forward to getting there now."
The Rio Olympics will run from 5-21 August.
