Councillors agreed that the pool, with 500 spectator seats, be built the Alan Higgs Centre.
The new plans mean the centre will lose its indoor football hall from October 2017 which is currently used by Coventry City Football Club Academy.
The charity that owns the Alan Higgs Centre will transfer the building to Coventry and Warwickshire Award Trust.
