Cape Wrath boat towed to safety after getting into difficulty

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A Lerwick-registered cargo boat is being towed to safety after getting into trouble overnight off Cape Wrath in the north west Highlands.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Norholm lost engine power at about 20:00 on Sunday and was drifting towards the coast in a westerly gale.
The Stornoway coastguard helicopter was scrambled in case the four-man crew had to abandon ship.
But the Lochinver lifeboat - which also went to the scene - managed to hold the Norholm off the shore.
The Thurso lifeboat is now also on its way to provide assistance along with the coastguard tugboat Herakles.
