Two males, aged 19 and 17, were arrested on Tuesday in connection with the death of Abdul Hafidah.
The 18-year-old was hit by a car and then stabbed on 12 May in Moss Side, Manchester, and died later in hospital.
Police believe he was chased near Greenheys Lane before being hit by a blue Vauxhall Corsa on Moss Lane East.
A post-mortem examination revealed he died of a stab wound to the neck. Four others arrested in connection with his death, including a boy of 14, were released on bail until 20 July.
Police are continuing to appeal for anyone who may have dash-cam footage of the incident or the area and said the attack took place in a busy area during rush hour.
