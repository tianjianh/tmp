Trump offered gifts to influence coverage - Megyn Kelly

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Fox News presenter Megyn Kelly has claimed Donald Trump tried to influence her to cover him positively by offering gifts including free hotel stays.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
She said she was not the only journalist who had been offered gifts, saying this was "one of the untold stories of the 2016 campaign".
The claims are in her memoir, to be released on Tuesday.
Ms Kelly and Mr Trump clashed after a debate she moderated in August last year.
Her first question to him asked about him calling women "fat pigs, slobs and disgusting animals".
After that debate, Mr Trump tweeted that she had "bombed" and he later said: "You could see there was blood coming out of her eyes, blood coming out of her wherever..."
This year, she said publicly that she did not want "any sort of war" with him, and the pair had a one-on-one interview, which aired in May.
In her memoir, Ms Kelly alleges that Mr Trump offered to fly her and her husband to his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida, or let her and her friends stay at his New York City hotel for free for the weekend. She said she did not accept his offers.
She said Mr Trump had attempted to influence journalists by praising them.
"This is smart," she writes, "because the media is full of people whose egos need stroking."
Publication of Ms Kelly's memoir was originally planned for November 2015, but it was delayed. It is called Settle for More.
