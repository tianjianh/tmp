Guernsey unemployment rises by 41 in 12 months

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Unemployment in Guernsey has rise by 41 to 381 in the 12 months to June.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The figures are from the Committee for Employment & Social Security's latest unemployment bulletin.
It also shows a further 242 people were registered as unemployed but had some work during the last week of June.
That number includes islanders in part-time or casual jobs and some who are in full-time work but are eligible for supplementary benefit because of low earnings.
