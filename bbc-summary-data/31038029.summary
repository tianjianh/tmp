West Ham manager Sam Allardyce says a deal to sign Darren Fletcher from Manchester United is "not dead yet".

Scotland captain Fletcher, 30, has been granted a free transfer to allow him to move to another club during the mid-season transfer window.
"It's still a possibility. But it's not absolutely certain," Allardyce said.
The West Ham manager, though, dismissed reports that he was looking to sign Swansea striker Bafetimbi Gomis or Burnley forward Danny Ings.
Asked if there was any truth in reports linking him with either player, Allardyce said: "No. I think that with us having Enner Valencia, Diafra Sakho, Carlton Cole and Andy Carroll, I've more than enough frontmen to cope with the demands of the rest of this season.
"In the summer, we'll see what happens but certainly at the moment we're fine with the four options we've got up front now."
Allardyce indicated on Tuesday that the signing of Fletcher would depend on whether the midfielder wanted to make the move.
Speaking on Thursday, the manager added: "We'd like a quality player of Darren's talent, if that's at all possible, but if it doesn't happen, we're not in a position where we desperately need players."
