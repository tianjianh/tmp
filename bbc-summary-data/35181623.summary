Kelly was always well placed on the 9-4 shot, trained by her stepfather Nick Williams and owned by her mother Jane.
"I'm delighted to do it on this horse. He showed what he is worth today," the 22-year-old told Channel 4.
"This has been a long time in the planning and it is some feeling."
Tea for Two jumped superbly with Kelly giving him an excellent ride and the pair stayed on strongly to defeat Southfield Royale in their 14th outing together.
Kelly had nearly landed a Grade One win in France last month when Aubusson was narrowly beaten by Thousand Stars.
