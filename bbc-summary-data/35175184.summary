A 34-year-old, believed to be a Polish national, was found badly injured in the early hours of Wednesday morning at flats in the city's Thurso Crescent.
He was taken to Ninewells Hospital but was pronounced dead a short time later.
Detectives described the death as "suspicious" and launched a major investigation.
A mobile command unit has been set up outside the flats.
