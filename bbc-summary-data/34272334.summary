Jeremy Corbyn: Labour won't back EU exit

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has told the BBC that he will not campaign for Britain to leave the European Union.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Mr Corbyn said that while policy was "developing" he could not foresee a situation where Labour would campaign for a "Brexit" under his leadership.
He has come under growing pressure from Labour MPs to clarify his position.
Mr Corbyn also said it was "very strange" his decision not to sing the national anthem at a Battle of Britain service had attracted so much interest.
The Labour leader, whose decision to stay silent during the playing of the national anthem at St Paul's Cathedral on Wednesday has attracted widespread criticism, said he had "respected the sacrifice" of those who had fought and died.
In a wide-ranging interview with the BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg, he said the final decision on policy would be his.
Asked about potential disagreements within his shadow cabinet, many of whose members did not back his leadership bid, he said there would be discussions ahead and urged colleagues to respect his mandate.
Earlier on Wednesday, Mr Corbyn took part in his first prime minister's questions, using the occasion to put questions from members of the public to PM David Cameron - an approach which he said meant "people's voices would be heard".
Telling MPs that he wanted to make PMQs "less theatrical" and more in touch with public concerns, he asked six questions on housing, tax credits and mental health which he said had been suggested to him by members of the public.
Mr Cameron, who began his own career as opposition leader in 2005 promising to end "Punch and Judy" politics, said "no one would be more delighted than me" if PMQs could become a "genuine exercise in asking questions and answering questions".
Laura Kuenssberg's verdict on PMQs
As promised, it was different. A parliamentary revolution in beige, Jeremy Corbyn's new leader's navy suit was nowhere to be seen.  It wasn't so much Jeremy Corbyn's questions to the prime minister but Gail, Marie, Steven, and Angela's questions.
What's also different? Camp Corbyn and David Cameron's team are both happy with the outcome of the crucial half hour of PMQs, the new Labour leader's first-ever outing at the despatch box.

Mr Corbyn, who is regarded as the most eurosceptic Labour leader for years, has insisted that Mr Cameron should not be given a "blank cheque" in negotiations about the UK's EU membership ahead of a future in-out referendum, and any changes he secures must be the "right ones".
Since being elected on Saturday, he has declined to categorically rule out campaigning for the UK to leave the EU - despite shadow foreign secretary Hilary Benn saying this should be the case and shadow justice secretary Lord Falconer saying he would quit if this happened.
Mr Corbyn told the BBC that policy was still "developing" but he said he envisaged making the UK's continued membership of the EU a manifesto commitment for the 2020 election.
Asked whether he could ever foresee campaigning to leave the EU, he replied: "No I don't see that position."
But he said he wanted the EU to change direction and move away from the increasingly market-driven model he said it had adopted in the past 20 years.
"We are having discussions to sort this question out. Basically, on the question of Europe, I want to see a social Europe, a cohesive Europe, a coherent Europe, not a free market Europe.
"That is a developing position. It is not a problem, we have had that discussion, we are continuing that discussion, there will be very clear statements coming out in the very near future."
He rejected suggestions that his position had shifted, adding: "What I remain opposed to is the idea that David Cameron could go around and give up workers rights, give up environmental protection, give up a whole load of things that are very important."
In the interview, Mr Corbyn refused to say whether he would kneel before the Queen as a prerequisite of joining the Privy Council - the historic body of senior politicians that advises the monarch on matters of state and receives security briefings.
As part of the Privy Council ceremony, politicians kneel before the Queen and kiss her hand but Mr Corbyn - who is a longstanding republican - said he "didn't know that was involved" and said he would discuss the matter with colleagues.
"Of course I'll end up being a member of the Privy Council if that's what the requirement of the job is. I think there are some things that ought to change in our society and maybe that's one of them."
Critics have accused Mr Corbyn of making a series of "unforced errors" since he became leader but senior figures in the party - including Lord Prescott and Margaret Beckett - have been supportive, welcoming his change of tactics at PMQs and insisting that he is "finding his feet".
Amid calls for him to do more to get his message across in the media, Labour announced that it had appointed a senior former aide to Ken Livingstone as the party's new director for policy and rebuttal.
