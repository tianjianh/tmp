One-Day Cup: Liam Livingstone shines on Lancashire debut

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Liam Livingstone hit an impressive 91 in his first one-day match to set up Lancashire's 51-run victory over Kent.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 22-year-old hit six fours and three sixes and put on 112 with Steven Croft as the visitors recovered from 26-3 to post 258-9 at Canterbury.
In response Kent collapsed to 95-6 with Jordan Clark (2-27) and Stephen Parry (3-60) doing most of the damage.
Alex Blake hit back, scoring a superb 89 off 56 balls but was bowled by James Faulkner as Kent were all out for 207.
Livingstone, who has made 13 T20 appearances for the Red Rose county, fell nine short of his century when he miscued a ramp shot off Darren Stevens to hand the all-rounder an easy caught-and-bowled chance.
With both teams innings defined by one player, Blake attempted to outclass and outscore his Lancashire counterpart, hitting five fours and seven sixes in his innings but his efforts were in vain as he ran out of partners.
It was Lancashire's second victory of the competition, who are now level on points with Kent on five, and with two matches remaining both side's can still qualify for the quarter-finals.
