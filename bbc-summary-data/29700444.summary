Eleven-month-old Harmonie-Rose Allen became ill in September and was rushed into Bristol Children's Hospital where she was diagnosed with a rare form of meningococcal septicaemia.
Harmonie-Rose's family want to raise money to help with her care and have stuck pink ribbons all around the estate where she lives.
BBC reporter Ali Vowles went to meet the family.
