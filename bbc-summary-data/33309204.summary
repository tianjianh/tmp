The moves by the Greek authorities came after the European Central Bank decided not to extend emergency funding.
The FTSE 100 fell more than 2% in early trade, and by the close was still down 133.22 points, or 1.97%, at 6,620.48.
Even bigger falls were seen elsewhere in Europe, with Germany's Dax index down 3.56% and France's Cac 40 index dropping 3.74%.
On the currency markets, the euro recovered much of the falls against the dollar that it saw in Asia. At one point, it had fallen below $1.10, but it later came back to $1.1185.
The pound rose 0.05% against the euro to â‚¬1.4102 and gained 0.15% against the dollar to $1.5774.
Among individual stocks, shares in travel companies fell after last week's killing of 38 people on a beach near Sousse in Tunisia. Shares in TUI dropped 7.1% and Thomas Cook was 3.7% lower.
Shares in equipment hire company HSS dived 26.6% to 134p after it said its second quarter trading performance had been "marginally below expectations". HSS floated on the market in February, when its shares were priced at 210p.
