[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Two teenagers who kidnapped then "tortured" a girl aged 14 by pouring salt down her throat and making her perform a sex act have been sentenced.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The girl was taken to a Hertfordshire flat last year by the pair, who she did not know, before being made to strip naked and sit in a freezing cold bath.
Caylen Candy and Chyanne Powell, both 18, admitted offences including causing a child to engage in sexual activity and kidnap at St Albans Crown Court.
They were detained at Friday's hearing.
The judge described the 17-hour ordeal that was filmed on a mobile phone as "humiliating and belittling".
Candy and Powell, who had been drinking, tried to rob the girl on her way to school before taking her to the flat in Waltham Cross on 24 September, the court heard.
During the kidnap they also put a knife to her throat and cut her hair, the court was told.
Candy, of Leabank Square, Hackney was sentenced to six years and three months in a young offenders' institution.
Powell, from Riverpoint, High Street, Waltham Cross, will serve seven-and-a-half years.
Judge Stephen Warner said it "showed a callous indifference to a visibly distressed victim who was pleading to be let go".
The court also heard, David Appiah, 21, later arrived at the flat and was shown pictures of the girl, who cannot be named, and the images were sent to another man, Sanjay Kalia, 18.
The court heard he then responded with comments.
"What she was subjected to was nothing short of torture - physically and psychologically - done for your amusement and gratification," the judge said.
