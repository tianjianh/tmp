A black Mercedes, carrying a family of five, collided with the ambulance on Babs Oak Hill in Sturry just before 14:00 BST.
Two girls, aged 12 and 14, were cut free from the car and airlifted to hospital with serious injuries.
Three other family members were taken to hospital with injuries not thought to be serious.
A South East Coast Ambulance Service spokesperson said one male staff member was taken to hospital with an ankle injury.
The ambulance was not carrying a patient at the time of the crash.
'Horrendous'
The two vehicles collided before leaving the road and ploughing through a fence into the garden of a property close to the A28.
The property owner John Lawrence told the BBC:  "It came straight through the fence and all chaos was let loose.
"We ran to see if we could offer help to the people in the vehicle...  It was just horrendous to see."
The South East Coast Ambulance Service said: "Our thoughts are with all those involved."
At 18:40 BST Kent Police said: "If you are planning to drive in this area please be patient, as the road is likely to remain closed for a number of hours."
Anyone who witnessed the collision, or saw either vehicle in the moments leading up to it, is asked to contact the Kent Police Serious Collision Investigation Unit.
