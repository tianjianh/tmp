[SN]TITLE[SN]
One-Day Cup: Weather denies Lancashire and Nottinghamshire at Blackpool

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Alviro Petersen and Luke Procter scored unbeaten half-centuries before rain denied Lancashire and Nottinghamshire in the One-Day Cup match at Blackpool.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Harry Gurney got rid of Tom Smith for a 16-ball duck, before Petersen made 73 not out and Procter 63 not out.
The pair's stand of 151 was a new one-day record for any wicket at Blackpool, beating 146 between David Lloyd and Farokh Engineer against Sussex in 1976.
Rain then arrived and play was eventually called off at 16:15 BST.
Notts, who had scored over 400 in their previous two games, would have gone top of their group with a victory.
Both sides are next in action on Wednesday when Lancashire have a home Roses match against Yorkshire and Nottinghamshire travel north to take on Durham.
