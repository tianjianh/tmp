Manchester United striker Wayne Rooney says reaction to his late-night conduct on England duty has been "disgraceful" and has vowed he is "not finished yet".

The England captain apologised over "inappropriate" pictures of him at a wedding at the England team hotel during the international break.
Rooney said his treatment showed "a lack of respect".
"It feels as if the media are trying to write my obituary and I won't let that happen," he added.
Speaking after he came off the bench for Manchester United in their draw with Arsenal at Old Trafford on Saturday, the 31-year-old claimed: "What's been going on is disgraceful.
"I love playing for my country and I am proud of my achievements to date - but I have not finished yet."

The Sun published images on Monday which it said showed Rooney drunk at a party late on Saturday night - a day after England's World Cup qualifying win over Scotland.
England players are to be banned by the Football Association from having nights out while on international duty.
The FA is looking into claims several players were out until late on the same night Saturday night - less than three days before they drew 2-2 with Spain in a friendly.
Speaking on Match of the Day, former England striker Ian Wright said: "I'm a big fan of Wayne's and he's been getting this for the past three or four years. It has been building and building.
"I'm pleased he's coming out with something like this. It is like he is fighting back. Fight back Wayne."
Ex-England captain Alan Shearer added: "All he has ever been is committed and available. If he was given the night off and he chose to stay in the hotel and have a few drinks then I don't think there's anything wrong with that.
"If he was told to go to bed by the manager and chose not to then he has undermined the manager and has to face the consequences."
Stoke midfielder and Scotland international Charlie Adam said on MOTD 2 Extra: "I totally agree with Rooney, he is spot on. He is the captain of his country and been one of the top players for a number of years. OK, he has had a drink, so what?
"He has been in the hotel and tried to do the right thing because he is a professional. England staff were there too.
"We have all been there on an international. We would meet up on a Sunday and we would have a one or two drinks before bed because we have all been playing at the weekend. It would never happen in the week. They have had a game, it is finished, they got back to the hotel and had a couple of drinks. What is wrong with that?"
