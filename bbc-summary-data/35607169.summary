Chris lives in Australia and his dogs perform tricks, jumping on his shoulders and back, as he rides the waves.
But he also travels around the country with them to help teach owners and rescue shelter staff how to look after their dogs better.
He teaches that exercise and discipline are really important for the wellbeing of dogs.
