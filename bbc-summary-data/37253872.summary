Sir Ian McKellen: Pride 2017 uncertainty 'alarming'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Actor Sir Ian McKellen has said uncertainty over next year's Pride event in Cardiff is "alarming".

The city council said there were "challenges" over the date next year, as the field would be used as a Champions League final fan zone.
Sir Ian said he hoped this did not mean a "serious change of attitude from the elected officials and the people they employ to service the city".
The council said it had not cancelled the event, which celebrates equality.
Sir Ian, who is appearing at Cardiff's New Theatre, said he had recently arrived back from India and China where he was visiting LGBT people who had had a difficult time with the authorities.
He said he was saddened to "come back to the United Kingdom and Wales and get a slight whiff of what I won't put any stronger than 'negativity'".
He said Pride "obviously belongs in the capital" and he hoped it would go ahead.
A Cardiff council spokesman said it had supported Pride Cymru since it began in 1999.
"The council is not looking to move Pride from Cooper's Field, but there will be some flexibility with events dates in next year's diary," he added.
"We are currently assessing all alternative possibilities and will continue to work closely with the organisers to support the event."
