They began the day at an event for young entrepreneurs in Mumbai, then laid a wreath in New Delhi at the India Gate memorial to 70,000 Indian soldiers who died in World War One.
The royal couple then paid tribute to independence leader Mahatma Gandhi.
They also attended a party at the British High Commissioner's residence.

The party celebrated the birthday of the Queen, who turns 90 on 21 April.
Prince William described himself as the "Queen's representative" and said his grandmother was "still very much the boss", as he read out a message from her and Prince Philip.
"I have fond memories of our previous visits to India and this event is a wonderful opportunity to celebrate the enduring friendship between our two countries, our shared culture and the business opportunities we can create together," the message said.
"It is with great pleasure that I entrust another generation of my family to strengthen and renew our bonds."
Having delivered the message, he said he could "report back to granny that I have done my duty".
The duke also paid tribute to his grandmother, describing her as "remarkably energetic" and a "dedicated guiding force for her family".
"I am so glad that children have the chance to get to know the Queen," he added.
"George and Charlotte too will discover how lucky they are to have such a wonderful great-grandmother, a role model for the rest of their lives."
By Peter Hunt, BBC royal correspondent
One Mumbai newspaper headline has declared "Royal couple charms crowds".
Images of a future king and queen demonstrating their sporting, competitive edge have proved irresistible to many British newspapers and broadcasters.
But such coverage doesn't mean that royal fever has descended on India.
Security concerns in the modern world mean that presidents and princes travel in a bubble, and only meet those who are invited and checked out in advance.

Why the Indian soldiers of WW1 were forgotten
At the Gandhi museum in Old Birla House, the duke and duchess paid their respects at the memorial marking the location where the statesman was assassinated in 1948.
On Tuesday the couple, who are visiting India for the first time, will meet the country's Prime Minister Narendra Modi before travelling to Kaziranga National Park in Assam to learn about the conservation work being done there.
On Sunday night, Prince William spoke of his admiration for India, during a speech at a charity gala in Mumbai attended by Bollywood film stars.
He praised "an India whose traditions, culture and civilisation go back thousands of years, and yet co-exist with an India that is young, creative, entrepreneurial".
Earlier, at the same venue - the Taj Mahal Palace Hotel - the couple spoke to survivors of the 2008 terror attacks in the city.
The seven-day tour will also see them travel to the remote Himalayan kingdom of Bhutan.
