A road in Bristol is being transformed into a nature-friendly habitat as part of a scheme by a local wildlife trust.

Residents of Stanley Park in Easton will see their front gardens given makeovers by volunteers as part of the My Wild Street community project.
Flower boxes, water traps, bird boxes and climbing plants are being installed to create urban "wildlife corridors".
Avon Wildlife Trust said the scheme was in recognition of Bristol's status as the 2015 European Green Capital.
Bevis Watts from the trust said: "It is hoped this project will put Bristol on the map for the natural world as a destination for wildlife and in recognition as a city aspiring to be nature-rich.
We hope this is something that will capture the imaginations of other streets, neighbourhoods and cities, to improve the quality of wildlife habitat in our urban spaces, and to bring nature to the forefront of people's minds."
Twenty seven of the 40 houses on the street have signed up to the fortnight-long initiative which is being part-funded by the local authority.
About 100 volunteers from Bristol law firm Burges Salmon will work with Avon Wildlife Trust experts and garden designers Earth, Timber, Stone to transform the street.
