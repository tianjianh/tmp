Prince William met injured players before the match at the Principality Stadium.
He told the BBC: "For the Six Nations they [Wales] have started strongly, they need to continue.
"Warren [Gatland] has brought the team together and there's a real strength and unity to that team."
The Duke of Cambridge, who is vice royal patron of the Welsh Rugby Union (WRU), attended a reception with players supported by the Welsh Rugby Charitable Trust, which pays for adapted vehicles and wheelchairs and offers pastoral care.
People travelling to the game by train had been advised to arrive at least three hours before kick off and to be aware of a new queuing system in place to deal with the 40,000 passengers expected to pass through Cardiff Central.
Bus services which normally terminate in the city centre will relocate to either Churchill Way for the east, Greyfriars Road for the north or Tudor Street for the west.
All roads were expected to reopen at 23:05.
