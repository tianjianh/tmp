The Dolgellau-based driver is on the entry list for the opening WRC round at Monte Carlo, starting on 19 January.
Evans, 28, will once again compete for the British M-Sport team driving the Ford Fiesta, but his car will use DMACK tyres.
His team-mates include the newly crowned World Champion, Sebastien Ogier and Estonian Ott Tanak.
Evans drove for M-Sport in the top class for two seasons in 2014 and 2015, but was demoted to the WRC2 class in 2016.
An announcement on the long-term future of Evans in the WRC is expected soon.
