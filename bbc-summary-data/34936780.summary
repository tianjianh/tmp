Chanel Purchase,  21, of Sheerness, Kent went on social media after the attack to search for his photograph, and he was arrested the following day.
James Huggett, 22, of Minster, attacked her after they met outside a nightclub and he walked her home in April 2014.
He denied the attack but was convicted of attempted rape at Maidstone Crown Court last week.
Miss Purchase, who has waived her anonymity, said the attack happened in her own road.
She said she screamed and he ran off, and when she got in her brother rang the police.
After police visited her house to take a statement and swabs, she spent three hours searching for his picture on Facebook, even though she did not know his name.
"He had told me a few friends that I may know. I did know a few. I thought if I can find a picture, and they would be on his friends' Facebook [pages], she said.
She said she persisted because she did not want him to be on the streets and she felt unsafe with him out there.
Miss Purchase emailed a picture of Huggett to police and he was arrested hours later.
Det Con Gavin Humphrey, from Kent Police, said Miss Purchase responded to what must have been a horrifying ordeal with a incredible bravery and determination.
He said her efforts in identifying Huggett allowed police to secure his arrest within seven hours of the incident.
Huggett, of Woodland Drive, is due to be sentenced in January following pre-sentence reports.
