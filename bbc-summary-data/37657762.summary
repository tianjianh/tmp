The Glynn Vivian Gallery closed in 2011 for a Â£6m renovation but construction delays mean it is now opening two years later than originally planned.
It reopened at 14:00 BST on Saturday after a parade from the YMCA on Kingsway - which acted as an offsite base during the closure.
Work by Turner, Picasso and Leonardo da Vinci is now on show there.
The renovated Alexandra Road attraction includes a new space for exhibitions, a new cafe and a shop, with about 90,000 visitors expected every year.
An extension also links the 1970s and 1911 sections of the gallery.
Swansea council's cabinet member for regeneration Robert Francis-Davies said the "wonderful character" of the original building has been preserved with it transformed into a "modern visitor destination".
He said it will make the arts "more accessible than ever" to Swansea residents.
First minister Carwyn Jones visited on Friday ahead of the opening.
He said: "This marvellous resource is now a fitting home for its many world class exhibits and able to reclaim its place as one of Wales's top cultural attractions."
The re-opened gallery will also exhibit artefacts its founder, Richard Glynn Vivian, collected on his travels around the world in the 19th Century.
