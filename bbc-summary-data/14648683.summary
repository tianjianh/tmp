Lebanon profile - Media

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Lebanon's broadcasting scene is developed, lively and diverse, and reflects the country's pluralism and divisions.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
It was the first Arab country to permit private radio and TV and has become a regional media hub.
Media freedom is enshrined in the constitution, although curbs forbid the media from defaming the president or other heads of state and from inciting sectarian strife.
Almost all TVs and radios are privately-owned and many are affiliated with political groups.
Commercial outlets Future TV and LBC have a large audience share. Al-Manar TV is operated by militant group Hezbollah. Take-up of satellite and cable is widespread.
Lebanese TVs are known for hosting some of the most daring cultural and social talks shows in the Middle East.
There are dozens of private radio stations. BBC Arabic and Radio France Internationale are carried by partner stations.
By 2016, Lebanon had more than 4.5 million internet users (Internetlivestats.com). But internet speeds are notoriously slow.
There are no widespread access curbs, although some sites relating to gambling and pornography, and some Israeli websites, are blocked.
News websites across the political spectrum are a key information source.
Social media are popular, especially WhatsApp. Facebook has been used for political activism.
