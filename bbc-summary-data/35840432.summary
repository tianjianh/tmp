Fifteen donate organs in first two months of new system

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Fifteen people donated their organs in the first two months of a new soft opt-out system in Wales.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Deemed consent came into effect in December - this means if people do not register a decision to opt out, their organs can potentially be donated to others after their death.
Of the 15 who donated in December and January, six had consent deemed.
Health minister Mark Drakeford urged families in Wales to continue talking about their organ donation decisions.
