Son Heung-min steered in a first-half opener before doubling their lead with another smart, angled finish.
Dele Alli added the third by slotting in Kyle Walker's cut-back, before Kane fired in from Son's low cross.
Stoke, who saw boss Mark Hughes sent off, offered little as their winless start stretched to a fourth game.

Relive Stoke v Tottenham as it happened
Spurs had made a steady, if not spectacular, start to the new Premier League season, but produced a clinical counter-attacking display to earn their second successive 4-0 win in the Potteries.
Mauricio Pochettino's young side played with the verve and dynamism which they regularly showed last season, when they challenged Leicester for the Premier League title before eventually fading to finish third.
Since April's win at Stoke, Spurs had won only one of their previous seven top-flight matches but ended that barren run in style.
Alli and Christian Eriksen, who provided the assists for both of Son's goals, were a constant threat as they broke from midfield, with Son's sharp finishing finally showing why Spurs paid Â£22m for him last summer.

While Son and Eriksen could justifiably lay claim to being the stars of the show, the travelling Spurs fans appeared to be most pleased by the sight of Kane smashing into an empty net from three yards.
The England striker, 23, had gone five Premier League games without scoring, with his previous goal in any competition coming in England's pre-Euro 2016 friendly against Turkey in May.
So the relief of ending his goalless run was clear from his celebration - and from the reaction of the jubilant Spurs fans chanting his name.
"All you can do as a striker is keep working hard and getting in positions to score," Kane said. "Sometimes you need the ball to fall for you - and it did today."
The goal had even more personal significance for the Londoner, who became the fastest man to score 50 Premier League goals for the club.
He is the fourth Spurs player to reach the milestone after Teddy Sheringham, Jermain Defoe and Robbie Keane.
But, in truth, he was still short of his best against Stoke.
Stoke began the day at the bottom of the Premier League - for only the third time since they were promoted before the 2008-09 season - after taking just one point from their opening three matches.
Potters boss Hughes said his team's performances had been better than their tally suggested, a statement which looked credible as they began on the front foot against Tottenham.
New signing Wilfried Bony, making his debut after signing on a season-long loan from Manchester City, looked sharp in the opening half hour, but his opportunities dried up as Stoke capitulated following Hughes' dismissal.
The Welshman was sent to the stands by referee Anthony Taylor shortly before Spurs' 41st-minute opener after reacting angrily to what he thought was a foul on Jon Walters and a yellow card given to Marko Arnautovic for diving.
"I was disappointed by those decisions and by my reaction as well," the former Manchester United striker said.
"I don't think my departure had an effect on my team's performance. It didn't make a difference."
Stoke manager Mark Hughes:
"That second half wasn't the level we needed to be at to get to get back into the game. The first half we started brightly and showed intent but the goal knocked us back. We got caught on the break and they were good goals."

Tottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino:
"I think that after four games unbeaten you can see that the players are thinking about the new season, the new challenge.
"We forget the past. We worked hard to forget last season and focus on the present. After four games we are unbeaten and you can see that the team has recovered.
Tottenham striker Harry Kane:
"It is not an easy place to come but to win 4-0 here last year and today made it look easier than it is. I don't think we started that well but then we punished them when we needed to."
Tottenham forward Son Heung-min:
"It is unbelievable to win at Stoke away. We had a great game and deserved to win. Both of my goals gave me pleasure because it is my first game of the season."
Tottenham turn their attentions to the Champions League. Spurs return to Europe's premier club competition for the first time since 2010-11 when they host Ligue 1 side Monaco at Wembley.
Stoke have a full week off before travelling to Crystal Palace in the Premier League next Sunday (14:15 BST).
