Roy, 26, has managed just 14 runs in two innings in the tournament but is set to keep his place at Edgbaston.
Jonny Bairstow, who has a batting average of 38.05 in 26 one-day internationals, has yet to feature in the Champions Trophy for hosts England.
"We all want Jason to do well," said Farbrace.
"I thought there were signs in Cardiff against New Zealand that he really looked as though he was very close to getting a big score."
Despite Roy's poor form, England have already booked their semi-final spot on Wednesday, 14 June with victories over Bangladesh and New Zealand.
Surrey batsman Roy managed 13 in the 87-run win over New Zealand having been dismissed for one in the eight-wicket win in the opening match against Bangladesh.
In the one-day international series win over South Africa last month, Roy managed a total of 13 runs in three innings.
Farbrace said he was confident Roy was not far off a big score and that he had been "excellent" in practice.
"The only thing that is frustrating for Jason is everyone talking about when is he going to get runs," added Farbrace.
"He knows that once he gets to 30 or 40 the chances are he is going to get 100.
"We all want him to do well because we know how important he is to us as a player and how much he plays the game in the right way for us as a team."
Bairstow hit 174 off 113 deliveries for Yorkshire against Durham in the Royal London One-Day Cup on 3 May.
He also struck a half-century for England against South Africa on 29 May and an unbeaten 72 against Ireland on 7 May.
"He can count himself particularly unlucky not to be playing in this tournament because he is a fantastic player in great form," said Farbrace.
"But the other six [batsmen] have done a brilliant job for us over a long period of time and we feel it is right to back and support them through their tough times."
