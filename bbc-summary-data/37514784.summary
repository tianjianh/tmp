Mr Street, who calls himself a "proud Brummie", was formally selected by local party members to fight the election in May next year.
He has handed in his resignation at John Lewis and will leave within a month, a member of his team said.
Labour's candidate is SiÃ´n Simon, an MEP for the West Midlands.
Beverley Neilsen, a former chief executive of the Heart of England Tourist Board, has been chosen as the Liberal Democrats' candidate.
Mr Street, who grew up in Birmingham, tweeted: "Truly proud to be selected as the Conservatives' candidate for the mayoral election. The campaign starts now."
At the party's conference in Birmingham this weekend, he will "set out his plans to make the West Midlands an even more prosperous and successful part of the country".
Since he became managing director in 2007, the John Lewis department store chain has enjoyed a 67% increase in sales to Â£3.7bn last year.
John Lewis is expected to make a statement on Friday regarding its future leadership.
