Five reasons we reckon Google Glass was pulled

It was once described as a glimpse into the future of technology.

But less than seven months after its UK release, it's RIP to Google Glass... in its current form at least.
The tech giant has confirmed that next week it'll stop taking orders for the experimental wearable device, which is controlled by voice and touch.
But Google says it is still committed to launching smart glasses in another form.
So here are five reasons we think it didn't work out.
At Â£990 pounds each, only a tech savvy consumer with dosh to spare would have been able to buy the glasses on a whim.
Having said that, Google always said the gadget - which was still a prototype - was being targeted at software developers not the masses.
They wanted early adopters to find a use for it, rather than expecting it to be popular straight away.
But Google could now be left with some disgruntled owners who'll never know its full potential.
If you struggle to keep the battery going on your mobile for a whole day, spare a thought for anyone who ever bought Google Glass.
Google advertised "one day of typical use" for the gadgets and you might just be able to squeeze that out of it.
But many critics claim filming or making video with the glasses rinsed the battery much MUCH quicker.
So no matter how much technology advances, clearly some things never change. Anyone got a spare charger?
You could call it a case of unrequited love. Or even a desperately sad love triangle where poor old Google Glass just didn't get a look in.
Because the simple truth is, the vast majority of us are already in a deeply committed monogamous relationship with our smartphones.
And well... there was just nothing Google Glass could do to get in the way of that.
Yes it offered a hands-free, quick to use alternative to the smartphone. Yes it offered the illusion of a floating screen with a built-in camera and microphone.
But the truth is, we still like keeping our technology firmly glued to our hands, just where it belongs.
Google released the gadget with the disclaimer that this was not necessarily The Next Big Thing - it was always an experiment.
But the hotly anticipated consumer launch just never followed suit.
Nevertheless, Google says the project has "broken ground" and helped them "learn what's important to consumers and enterprises alike".
The firm is promising to keep working on a similar project for the future - so we'll look out for that.
But for now, well done for trying Google. It was a bold and briefly exciting glimpse into the future.
2014 was supposed to be the year wearable technology took off, but it just didn't.
Until everyone's wearing robotic headsets, like a permanent state of Daft Punk video, most of us would probably feel a bit foolish sporting Google Glass in the street.
For example, we think our Technology Reporter Jonathan Blake (above) is one of the coolest kids in the Newsbeat office.
But even he looks plain daft in Google's specs.
It may be clever technology, but firms are learning the hard way gadgets need to be fashionable as well as functional.
