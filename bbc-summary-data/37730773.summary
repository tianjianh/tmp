[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Jamie O'Rourke was arrested at a swimming pool in Stockport, Greater Manchester, in 2014, and went on to sexually assault two 15-year-old girls.
The 27-year-old admitted seven child sex offences and two of voyeurism.
O'Rourke, who was already on the sex offenders register, was jailed for seven-and-a-half years at Manchester Minshull Street Crown Court.
O'Rourke, of Crescent Road, Brinnington, was also placed on a sexual harm prevention order for 10 years, which forbids him from entering public areas such as swimming pools and changing rooms.
He was arrested for an attack on one of the girls in Stockport in January, police said.
Inquiries then revealed he had engaged in a sexual relationship with another teenager between November 2015 and February.
Det Ch Insp John Harris said: "I want to commend the victims for supporting our investigations, during what has been a difficult time.
"With their help, we have been able to ensure O'Rourke is behind bars and cannot prey on any more young girls."
