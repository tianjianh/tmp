Staff said lurcher cross Bowie had been at the Dogs Trust rehoming centre in Bridgend since November "because of his different-coloured eyes".
The singer's son Duncan Jones tweeted support for a bid to rehome Bowie, three, earlier this month.
His new owner Dr Nia Bowen said she "fell in love instantly".
The dogs home said no-one had shown any interest in the "quirky canine with bundles of energy".
But when Dr Bowen saw the online appeal to find him a new home, she was smitten.
"We had recently lost our dogs so we weren't necessarily looking to get another one straightaway," she said.
"But when we saw Bowie's photo online calling for people to give him a home, we fell in love instantly.
"He is a brilliant, bouncy boy, with a real zest for life."
Angela Wetherall, the rehoming centre manager, added: "He was quite the celebrity at the centre with staff and we're so pleased that the appeals to get him a home were seen and heard."
