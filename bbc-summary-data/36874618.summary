RMT strike begins in ScotRail driver-only train dispute

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Members of the RMT union at ScotRail have begun another one-day strike in their dispute over driver-only trains.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The union said it had no other option after the failure of talks at the conciliation service Acas.
The RMT is campaigning against the increased use of trains without guards, with the driver opening and closing the doors at stations.
ScotRail has said such operations are already common on the network, particularly on suburban services.
The operator has also promised to  ensure a second member of staff was onboard every train to assist the driver in emergencies.
Phil Verster, managing director of Scotrail Alliance, said: "This industrial action by the RMT is not about safety, it's not about a second person on a train and it's not about jobs or pay and conditions.
"It is about modernisation of the railway and preparing us for a railway that Scotland can be proud of for the next 40 or 50 years."
But the union claims the absence of a dedicated guard would make trains less safe.
The strike is the latest of several held during the dispute. Another one-day strike is due be held next Sunday, 31 July.
Scottish Labour has called on Transport Minister Humza Yousaf to intervene to try to reach a negotiated settlement.
Mr Yousaf, however, tweeted that he had already discussed the dispute with ScotRail and the RMT, and would continue to do so.
He also called for the suspension of strike action while dialogue took place.
Transport Scotland said it had been assured by ScotRail that over 80% of services would run as normal this weekend.
Passengers are advised to check the ScotRail strike information web page before they travel.
