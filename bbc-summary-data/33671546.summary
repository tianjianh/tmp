Lord Sewel faces call to quit Parliament over drugs claim

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Senior peer Lord Sewel has been urged to resign from the House of Lords after he was filmed allegedly taking drugs with prostitutes.

Lord Sewel, who is yet to comment on the claims, has already quit as Lords deputy speaker and chairman of the Lords privileges and conduct committee.
He could also face a police inquiry over the Sun on Sunday's footage.
Labour MP John Mann said the 69-year-old should resign from the Lords voluntarily before he was expelled.
But BBC assistant political editor Norman Smith said that sources in the House of Lords say Lord Sewel has indicated he does not intend to quit as a peer.
It comes as the Sun published further photographs of the peer in Monday's newspaper, along with details of new footage in which he is said to make disparaging remarks about a number of other politicians.
The original footage released appeared to show Lord Sewel snorting powder from a woman's breasts with a Â£5 note.
Lords Speaker Baroness D'Souza condemned his behaviour, saying it was "shocking and unacceptable" and the allegations would be referred to the House of Lords commissioner for standards and the Metropolitan Police.
Standards Commissioner Paul Kernaghan will gather evidence and the cross-party privileges and conduct committee will then decide on a punishment.
Mr Mann said: "He cannot possibly go in front of his own committee and expect a serious hearing.
"He is a disgrace. He should retire and resign immediately.
"A lifetime ban would be the committee's only option. He needs to save them and himself further embarrassment and go now."
The House of Lords (Suspension and Expulsion) Act 2015 - which received Royal Assent only in March and which Lord Sewel himself helped to introduce - allows peers to be barred from Parliament if they breach the code of conduct.
The code maintains that members must "always act on their personal honour".
On Monday, the Sun published a picture of Lord Sewel wearing an orange bra and leather jacket while smoking a cigarette, on its front page.
David Cameron, Boris Johnson and the four Labour party leadership contenders were among those criticised by the peer, the Sun reports.
Lord Sewel is said to have described Mr Cameron as "the most facile, superficial prime minister there's ever been", and Mr Johnson as "a joke".
He is also said to have called Scottish MP Alex Salmond "pompous", and claimed the reason former Labour Prime Minister Tony Blair took the decision to go to war in Iraq was "because he fell in love with George Bush".
Lord Sewel, a former Labour minister who is now not affiliated to any political party, served in the Scotland Office under Mr Blair's government.
The Sewel convention, which applies to the relationship between Westminster and the UK's devolved parliaments and assemblies, is named after him.
The former senior vice-principal of the University of Aberdeen has been a member of the Lords since 1996.
Lord Sewel's privileges and conduct committee role came with an Â£84,500 salary and meant he was in charge of proceedings when the Lords considered a bill at committee stage, and was automatically made a deputy speaker.
In a recent blog for the Huffington Post, he said the Lords had taken "major steps" to "protect its reputation and punish misconduct by its members".
"Scandals make good headlines... The requirement that members must always act on their personal honour has been reinforced," he wrote.
