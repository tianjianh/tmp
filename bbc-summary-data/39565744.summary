Scott had been competing at Leeds Martial Arts College the night before, when he collapsed in the last round of the five-round contest, the inquest was told.
Mr Leach was told the bout had been full-contact, against someone of similar size and age, and Scott was "wearing appropriate protective equipment".
Emergency treatment was given by on-site medics and paramedics were called but Scott died the following day at Leeds General Infirmary.
Scott's family did not attend Wakefield Coroner's court, where the inquest was adjourned to a date yet to be fixed.
Scott, from Sheffield, started entering competitions at the age of eight.
He trained at the Marsden's All Styles Kickboxing club in Hillsborough, that was run by members of his family, and was a pupil at Forge Valley School.
Speaking after his death Dale Barrowclough, the school's head teacher, said: "Scott was a very popular young man among pupils and staff alike and it is without doubt that he had a very bright sporting future ahead of him."
In the wake of his death Jon Green, England president of the World Kickboxing Association, criticised the response by emergency services that were also called on the night.
But Yorkshire Ambulance Service NHS Trust, said: "All of our staff worked tirelessly to provide the patient with the best possible care and transport him to hospital for further treatment."
The British Kickboxing Council has said the tragedy demonstrated how the sport, that does not have a UK governing body, needs regulation.
