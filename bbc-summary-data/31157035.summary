[SN]TITLE[SN]
Brecon flower named after Sir David Attenborough

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A species of wild flower which was found a decade ago in the Brecon Beacons has been named in honour of Sir David Attenborough.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Attenborough Hawkweed is one of a group of closely related plants which belong to the daisy family and has probably evolved in the Brecon Beacons since the last ice age.
The hawkweeds are close relatives of dandelions and have similar looking flowers.
Sir David said he was "thrilled".
He added: "Bestowing a name on a new species is surely one of the greatest of biological compliments and I am truly grateful."
Dr Tim Rich, the plant taxonomist who named the new species, said: "Finding a new species is a really exciting moment and something that you dream of as a naturalist.
"I decided to name this special little plant found in the mountains of the Brecon Beacons after David Attenborough as he inspired me to study ecology when I was 17."
