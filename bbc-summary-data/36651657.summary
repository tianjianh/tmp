The 25-year-old, who recently had a short loan spell at the Southern Kings, has signed an initial one-year deal until May 2017.
The 6ft 7in Uanivi has won 16 caps for his country, and started all four of their matches at last year's World Cup.
"I'm very pleased to have this chance to play with Glasgow," he said.
"I can't wait to get started. I'd like to thank the Sharks, and Gary Gold in particular, for allowing me the chance to pursue this exciting opportunity and I wish them well in Super Rugby."
Uanivi, who can also play across the back row, previously played 10 times for Brive in the Top 14 and European Rugby Challenge Cup prior to joining the Sharks in January after impressing at the World Cup.
Glasgow head coach Gregor Townsend said: "We believe he'll fit in well in our environment and challenge for a starting place in our forward pack.
"He has excellent athleticism and his strengths suit the high-tempo rugby we aspire to play, but he will have to work hard every day to win a starting place up against the other second-rows at the club."
Warriors have lost Fiji's Leone Nakarawa to Racing Metro but still have Scotland locks Jonny Gray and Tim Swinson, plus Scotland under-20s captain Scott Cummings in their second-row ranks.
Uanivi joins Italy wing Leonardo Sarto, former All Blacks hooker Corey Flynn,Fiji scrum-half Nemia Kenatale and props Djustice Sears-Duru and Jarrod Firth in the Scotstoun squad for next season.
