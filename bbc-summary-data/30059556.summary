[SN]TITLE[SN]
Night-time travel allowed on A890 Stromeferry bypass

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Stromeferry bypass in Wester Ross has been reopened after a landslide led to travel on the road being restricted to between 07:00 and 19:00.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The stretch of road on the A890 was closed following rock falls last month, before it was later partially reopened.
Highland Council said work to further stabilise rock in the area would continue over the next two to three weeks.
The local authority is seeking a long term solution to the bypass.
