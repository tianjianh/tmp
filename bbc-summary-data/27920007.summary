Four men armed with knives forced their way into his north-west London home and held his wife and children before making off with personal possessions.
The 50-year-old former Arsenal star, who has been working for ITV in Brazil, tweeted: "You won't get away with it."
The Metropolitan Police said it was investigating an aggravated burglary.
Following his return the football pundit told reporters: "All I want to say, really, is that my missus, my girls, everyone's safe.
"The police are trying to get on doing what they are doing."
Speaking about his wife, he said: "She's feeling good that I am back."
Earlier Steve Kutner, Wright's agent, said: "It was a terrifying ordeal. They marched Ian's wife from room to room."
A spokeswoman for Ian Wright said: "Nancy [his wife] is really shaken up. Their kids are so young that hopefully they aren't going to read into it too much.
"They are all physically OK - Nancy and the kids."
Wright's neighbours expressed their shock at the robbery.
Next-door neighbour Marianne Collinge said: "They are very unpretentious people. They are one of us and I'm terribly sorry for them, it's awful."
Another neighbour, Chris Martin, said: "Ian is a neighbour and a decent family man. He's been living here several years and everyone around here respects his privacy."
A Metropolitan Police spokesman said: "We are investigating an aggravated burglary at an address in north-west London after we were called at 9.20pm last night.
"The four suspects are described as black men, aged between 18-25. They are said to have spoken with London accents and were wearing dark clothing and hoodies obscuring their faces."
Det Ch Insp Mick Gornall said: "Fortunately no-one was injured during the burglary, but it is still very frightening to have people force their way into your home and threaten you."
Officers are reviewing CCTV footage.
