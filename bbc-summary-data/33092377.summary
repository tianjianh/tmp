The newborn Staffordshire bull terrier cross pups were discovered by children on Chester Road East, Queensferry, in March.
The puppies were taken to the RSPCA's Bryn-y-Maen Animal Centre where they were cared for.
Animal care assistant Abbie Griffith said watching the puppies leave for their new homes was a "bittersweet" moment.
