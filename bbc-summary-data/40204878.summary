Vandals who broke into Pickie Fun Park in Bangor helped themselves to an ice cream before going on the rampage.

A young man and woman were caught on CCTV entering the popular seafront park via the ice cream kiosk at about 01:00 BST on Thursday.
Operations manager Nigel McNeely says the pair used a golf club to break in and they spent nearly an hour "trashing" the place.
"Considerable" damage was caused and the park was closed on Thursday.
Mr McNeely told the BBC: "They entered the ice cream kiosk via the window and subsequently served themselves ice cream before going on a rampage."
He said they were still "assessing the loss" but there was "quite a lot of broken glass and damage to equipment", including the fire alarm and sensors.
The vandals tried to gain access to a till in the cafe but had "no joy", he said.
Mr McNeely said several schools were closed in the County Down town on Thursday because of the election, and in addition to the loss of business, staff members due to work had lost out on pay.
"We are working hard to get things put back together and hopefully reopen for normal business on Friday," he added.
A PSNI spokesman said: "Police in Bangor are investigating a burglary at commercial premises at Marine Gardens in the early hours of Thursday 8 June. At this stage it is unclear if anything has been stolen.
"Police would ask anyone with any information to contact them in Bangor on 101 or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111."
