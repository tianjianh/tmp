One eBay seller claims to have a "small supply" of the French magazine.
"This is the UK version of the magazine that will most likely be printed in English," the item description claims.
Charlie Hebdo will be available in some shops in the UK and editions are being printed in languages including English, Arabic and Turkish.
Buyers on eBay are supposed to honour their bids.
However, it is possible for users to retract offers and there is no guarantee sales will go through at the current price.
Some users have been bidding up to £60,000 before retracting their offers.
Five million copies are being printed a week after Islamist gunmen murdered eight journalists at Charlie Hebdo magazine in Paris.
In total 17 people were killed last week in France.
Some of the money raised in sales from the cover price will be going to the families of the victims of last week's shootings.
There is no suggestion that any profits made by re-sellers will be contributed to the donation.
There are long queues at newsstands in France, where the edition of the satirical magazine went on sale on Wednesday.
The cover of this week's publication shows a cartoon of the Prophet Muhammad crying while holding a sign saying "Je suis Charlie" (I am Charlie).
The phrase trended on social media after the shootings and has become a slogan of solidarity.
Three million copies of the latest edition of Charlie Hebdo were originally printed but this was increased to five million after overwhelming demand for the issue.
Normally 60,000 are printed each week.
One shop in Paris claims all its copies were sold in five minutes.
