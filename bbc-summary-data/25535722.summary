A shed and summer house were destroyed, and heat damage was caused to a house in a fire in Blackfield in the early hours of Friday.
Police said the homeowner, in his 80s, could have been in "life-threatening danger" if the fire not been spotted.
They are linking it to a blaze at a takeaway and a car fire in the village earlier this month.
