[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A group of five young men allegedly defrauded 18 elderly people of more than half a million pounds, the Old Bailey has heard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Vulnerable pensioners were tricked out of more than Â£600,000 by fake police officers in a so-called "vishing" scam, the jury was told.
The men are accused of posing as police officers investigating financial crime.
It is alleged the five convinced their victims to transfer money or hand over cash to a courier for "safe keeping".
Mohamed Dahir, 23; Sakaria Aden, 21; Yasser Abukar, 23; and Ibrahim Farah, 23, and Mohammed Abokar, 28, all from north London - deny conspiracy to commit fraud between May 2014 and May 2015.
Mr Abokar also denies a charge of converting criminal property.
The men are accused of taking part in the scam between 2014 and 2015, which targeted pensioners aged in their 70s, 80s and 90s from Cornwall, Devon, Dorset, Bedfordshire, London and Kent.
The trial continues.
