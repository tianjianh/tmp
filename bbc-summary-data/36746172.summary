[SN]TITLE[SN]
Fifa scandal: Sepp Blatter CAS appeal date set for 25 August

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Former Fifa president Sepp Blatter's appeal against a six-year ban from football is to be heard at the Court of Arbitration for Sport on 25 August.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Blatter, 80, and former Uefa president Michel Platini were last year found guilty of ethics breaches over a 2m Swiss Franc (Â£1.3m) "disloyal payment".
Platini resigned from European football's governing body after failing to have a six-year ban from football overturned in May.
Both deny wrongdoing.
They had their original bans reduced from eight to six years by the Fifa appeals committee, and Platini's was further reduced to four years by CAS.
