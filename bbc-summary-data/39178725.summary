Steps are coming back with an Abba song

They started off as a novelty act, designed to cash in on the 1990s line-dancing craze - but Steps' popularity has been surprisingly long-lived.

Often derided as a "bargain basement Abba", they sold more than 15 million albums before their split in 2001.
After reforming in 2012, they've finally made a new album - which happens to include a song by Abba's BjÃ¶rn Ulvaeus and Benny Andersson.
Called Story of a Heart, it's a cover of a song by Andersson's current band.
Written in the vein of The Winner Takes it All, it's a typically Abba-esque ballad about a woman whose life is turned upside down when she sees an old lover's face in a crowd.
"The song's got a good story," Steps' singer Lisa Scott-Lee told Popjustice. "We felt it was a good nod to where we've been musically as a band, but I related to the words while I was recording it."
It's certainly a cunning choice - acknowledging the band's debt to Abba, without desecrating one of their classics.
According to singer Claire Richards, it has even had the seal of approval from Abba themselves.
"Benny really liked our take on it," she told The Sun. "He said it's almost as good as his version!"
Story of a Heart will feature on Tears on the Dancefloor, Steps' first album of new songs since Buzz, released 17 years ago.
It will be preceded by a single, Scared of the Dark, which is out this Friday; and the band will embark on a 15-date tour this November.
Scott-Lee said the world was ready for another dose of Steps' bright-eyed chart pop.
"What we can offer is escapism and a bit of positivity in people's lives," she said. "Everyone's dealing with lots of different things but music's universal, and it takes you to another place and time, and this album - I feel - is where Steps should be 20 years on."
