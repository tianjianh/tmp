Sheridan Smith to take Funny Girl on tour

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Sheridan Smith is to reprise her hit West End role as Fanny Brice in Funny Girl when it goes on a tour of the UK next year.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The actress, who took almost two months off from the musical due to stress and exhaustion earlier this year, will kick off the tour in Manchester in February.
She will also appear in cities such as Liverpool, Bristol and Cardiff.
Smith will not appear at all the venues on the tour, with further casting will be announced shortly.
The stage and TV star will also play several dates in Dublin.
When Smith took time off from the London production in May, the producers said she would get "the rest and support she needs".
The actress, who has two Olivier awards for her stage roles in Legally Blonde and Flare Path, was made an OBE last year. She has described the part of Fanny as her "dream role".
The production of Funny Girl transferred to the Savoy Theatre in April after a successful run at the Menier Chocolate Factory.
The venues Sheridan Smith will perform at:
The tour will also take in Stoke, Aberdeen, Woking, Canterbury, Glasgow, Nottingham and Llandudno but those performances will star a different leading lady, yet to be revealed.
When Smith was taking a break from the West End production, her part was taken over by understudy Natasha J Barnes to great acclaim.
Barnes continues to star in Monday evening performances.
The show's run at the Savoy ends on 8 October.
