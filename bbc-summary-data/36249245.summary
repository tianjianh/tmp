Portsmouth defender Ben Davies is looking forward to "a straight shoot-out" in the League Two play-offs against Plymouth Argyle.

Pompey will meet Argyle in the semi-final first leg at Fratton Park on Thursday after they finished sixth.
"When you look at the bigger picture, you have to play your opponents home and away whatever happens, so it doesn't really matter," Davies said.
"What happened earlier in the season between us goes out of the window."
A 2-1 home defeat by champions Northampton on Saturday meant Pompey finished below Argyle, but 34-year-old Davies believes two massive games are ahead of them.
"It's about a straight shoot-out now," he told BBC Radio Solent.
"We can take confidence into the play-offs with some of the performances we've had this season.
"Play-offs are tense games and we'll be well-organised. We firmly believe in ourselves.
"We've got players and a gaffer with experience of these games and situations. You have to be on it from the first minute to the last in both legs."
