[SN]TITLE[SN]
Man attempted to murder wife on school run, court hears

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man repeatedly stamped on his wife's head during an attack while walking three of their children to school in Gwynedd, a court has heard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Sylvan Parry, 46, from Caernarfon, denies attempting to murder Fiona Parry on 3 September.
Mold Crown Court heard the attack left Mrs Parry with life-changing injuries.
The prosecution said Mr Parry had used "considerable force" and had only stopped when on-duty fire officers who had witnessed the attack intervened.
Prosecuting barrister Sion ap Mihangel said: "This was clearly an attempt by this defendant to kill his wife. It was only because of the intervention of others that he did not succeed in killing her."
The court heard the incident happened on the first day of the new school term.
Mrs Parry had dressed the children for school and taken photographs of them in their school uniforms before leaving the house.
As the couple made the short walk from their house with their baby in a pram and two children, Mr Parry started behaving "aggressively" and issued threats to his wife before attacking her, Mr ap Mihangel told the court.
He added: "He was told to stop what he was doing by one of the officers but he continued to stamp and he was seen to kick his wife twice before walking away."
In a video interview Mrs Parry told police she could not remember anything about what had happened that day because of a brain injury sustained during the attack.
She could not remember getting the children ready for school, leaving her home or the attack.
The trial continues.
