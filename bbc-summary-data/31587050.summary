How to do the Oscars like Lady Gaga

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Never mind the Oscars' winners and runners up, there was one star who stole the show in LA last night.... Lady Gaga.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Three dress changes, two hair styles and one show-stopping performance.
We salute Gaga's ability to steal the limelight and help boost sales of massive gloves.
So here's how to do the Oscars like Lady Gaga.
Obviously, first things first, you're going to need a super sparkly ball gown and a MEGA pair of washing up gloves.
The real Gaga opted for red, but if you want to make a similar impact in future, you surely couldn't go wrong with classic pink or yellow either.
Just make sure they're massive and that you hold your arms in a manner which suggests they don't quite belong to your body.
The next step to achieving the Lady Gaga Oscars look is to get a bit peacocky.
Don't worry, there's nothing to it really.
Just keep your chin up, carry a sense of pride and pop that neck!
While we're on the birdy theme, if you really want to draw attention to those washing up gloves, don't be afraid to move like a chicken.
Simply push back your elbows... flap in... and flap out.
What better way to get from A to B on the the red carpet?
Cluck cluck!
Next, compose yourself for photographers like a bride getting ready to walk down the aisle.
Delicately pinch your gown while your "maid of honour" (or Oscars handywoman) fans out your train.
All good training (geddit?) for the singer who announced her engagement last week.
Come on, who could resist?
Here's the bit everyone's been waiting for.... quick dress change, new hair do and whip out some classic Sound of Music hits for your adoring audience.
Love that limelight Gaga! (Is this the Oscars or Eurovision?)
Introduce the woman behind the music... Julie Andrews (actual Mary Poppins) and tell each other how fantastic you are.
Then...
Share a moment with the Hollywood legend.
It is the Oscars after all, darling!
Once you've got into the swing of things, don't be afraid to just do more crying.
Just make sure your make up artist is on hand in case your face gets a bit too moist.
After all that high emotion and an exhausting performance, let your hair down, lay the eye liner on extra thick and go to the goth section of your make-up bag.
Slip into a slinky black number... and just pout.
And that's all there is to it: Oscars Lady Gaga style. Easy, if you are Lady Gaga.
