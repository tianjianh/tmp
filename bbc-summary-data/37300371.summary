[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Joseph O'Brien came out of retirement for one day only at the age of 23 - and won the Leger Legends charity race.

The ex-jockey, now a trainer in Ireland, triumphed by one-and-a-quarter lengths on 7-1 shot Phosphorescence, trained by George Scott.
Peter Buchanan was second on Janaab, with 69-year-old George Duffield third aboard Red Charmer.
Former champion jockey Richard Hughes was fourth on favourite Bluff Crag in the race won last year by AP McCoy.
Hughes was one place ahead of BBC 5 live racing reporter Luke Harvey, who rode Gun Case on day one of the St Leger meeting.
O'Brien, who is about 6ft tall, retired due to weight issues earlier this year but agreed to ride in the race, which raises money for the Injured Jockeys' Fund.
He was fined Â£500 by the stewards at Doncaster for using his whip above the permitted level. A British Horseracing Authority spokesman said it was highly likely the fine would be donated to charity.
