Heavy lifting gear has been brought in to clear the site of the accident which killed one man whose body was recovered, and injured five others.
The recovery operation has been criticised by their families of the missing men for being too slow.
The plant was set for demolition when it collapsed on 23 February.
Thames Valley Police and the Health and Safety Executive said returning the missing men to their families "remains a priority".
The bodies of Christopher Huxtable, 34, from Swansea, Ken Cresswell, 57, and John Shaw, 61, both from Rotherham, have not been found following the collapse.
The body of Michael Collings, 53, from Cleveland, North Yorkshire, was recovered from the site.
His funeral was held near Redcar on Tuesday, with hundreds of bikers attending.
In a joint statement on Wednesday, Thames Valley Police and the Health and Safety Executive said: "Starting today, large equipment and people will be arriving on site to start work to enable the recovery operation to resume at the weekend, sooner if possible.
"Our priority remains the recovery of the missing men so they can be returned to their families and to understand what caused this incident.
"Specialist officers from Thames Valley Police continue to support the families and are providing them with regular updates on the progress of this work."
Demolition company Coleman and Co said: "Our over-riding priority remains to support the families of those who have died or are still tragically missing, and the start of the recovery operation is an important milestone in a process to re-unite our missing colleagues with their families."
