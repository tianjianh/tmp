Pembrokeshire stargazing sites bid for special status

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Ten stargazing sites along Pembrokeshire's coast have been nominated for special recognition.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Pembrokeshire Coast National Park Authority members have agreed to submit the sites for consideration as Dark Sky Discovery sites.
These sites are classed as some of the best stargazing locations in the UK.
The National Park currently has one Dark Sky Discovery site at Broad Haven South near Bosherston.
The authority hopes to attract stargazers and photographers by obtaining this status and the proposals will now be considered by the UK Dark Sky Discovery Partnership.
