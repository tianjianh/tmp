A retired postman has said he got the "best Christmas present ever" after tracking down his father's war medals at an auction.

James Roat, 73, of Lingwood, Norfolk, paid Â£130 for the three World War One medals but said he would have gone to "whatever price necessary".
His father, Clifton, who died aged 89, was awarded the Star, Victory and British war medals.
He said: "I'm so pleased to have got them. I did a dance of joy."
Mr Roat, who is one of eight children, said he was alerted to the medals after joining various online forums in a bid to research his family history.
He then received a message informing him that the medals were coming up for auction in Bury St Edmunds.
"I was up against a phone bidder but would've paid whatever price necessary," he said. "I didn't think I'd ever see them.
"I can't thank the person enough who got in touch. I've sent him loads of emails thanking him."
Mr Roat said his father, a farm worker, sold the medals in the 1950s, "probably for a couple of pints".
"We were a big family so I think he needed the money," said Mr Roat.
"My siblings are so happy. This is the best Christmas present ever. I don't care if I don't get anything else.
"I remember the medals as a child but never thought I'd see them again."
He said his father was part of The Essex Regiment.
