Salford bounced back from defeat by Bradford to ease to victory at Halifax in The Qualifiers.

Niall Evalds crossed twice in the first 15 minutes for the Red Devils before Dane Manning went over for the hosts.
Tries from Greg Johnson and Ben Jones-Bishop made it 6-22 at the break.
Scott Murrell, James Saltonstall and Jacob Fairbank scored to give the hosts hope but Evalds, Jones-Bishop and Johnson all completed their hat-tricks before Adam Tangata's consolation try.
Victory for Salford, who parted company with coach Iestyn Harris this week, means they have three victories from their four matches in The Qualifiers.
Championship side Halifax have lost all four of their games in the second stage of the season and are set for another season in the second tier.
