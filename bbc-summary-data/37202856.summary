Maidstone United 2-2 Wrexham

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Maidstone United snatched a draw against Wrexham thanks to substitute Liam Enver-Marum.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Enver-Marum was on hand to make Wrexham pay for a defensive error after the Dragons had seized control.
Two goals either side of half time from Callum Powell gave Gary Mills' side the advantage.
Maidstone scored the opener through Ben Greenhalgh's freekick but Wrexham were able to avoid a third successive away defeat in the National League.
Wrexham manager Gary Mills told BBC Radio Wales Sport:  "I thought we were so much better in the second half, we went 2-1 up and were dominating the game, I couldn't see them getting back into it.
"A mistake has cost us a couple of points, but it happens.
"But it is a good point for us away from home."
