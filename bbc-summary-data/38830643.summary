[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Five men and a woman have gone on trial accused of the rape, sexual abuse and prostitution of nine girls.

Prosecutors allege some of the girls were befriended and given drink and drugs before being forced to have sex.

The offences are said to have taken place in Sheffield between 2005 and 2012. The defendants deny the charges.

Prosecutor Peter Hampton said brothers, Christopher, Shane and Matthew Whiteley, Andre Francis-Edge, Taleb Bapir and Amanda Spencer "in differing ways sexually abused and facilitated the sexual abuse of teenage girls".
He told jurors that Christopher Whiteley and Amanda Spencer had "played a key role in the abuse".
The court was told Christopher Whiteley, who was aged 13 in 2005, would appear "charming" at first before being "aggressive, intimidating, threatening and on occasions violent".
The jury heard that at the time the alleged offending began he had already been convicted of two sexual offences.
Mr Hampton said Miss Spencer had "likely" been the victim of child sexual exploitation but had "turned her dreadful situation on its head and she became a facilitator of sexual abuse herself".
The jury heard Miss Spencer was convicted of 16 child prostitution offences in 2014.
Christopher Whiteley, 23, of Weakland Crescent in Hackenthorpe, Sheffield, is charged with 13 counts of rape, two counts of conspiracy to rape, two child prostitution offences, two counts of sexual assault on a child under 13, one count of theft and one count of sexual assault;
Shane Whiteley, 30, also of Weakland Crescent, is charged with three child prostitution offences and two counts of conspiracy to rape;
Matthew Whiteley, 24, also of Weakland Crescent, is charged with two child prostitution offences, two counts of conspiracy to rape and two counts of sexual activity with a child;
Amanda Spencer, 26, of Canklow Road, Rotherham, is charged with eight counts of aiding and abetting rape and 12 child prostitution offences;
Andre Francis-Edge, of Wheatley Road in Parson Cross, Sheffield is charged with one count of rape, one count of conspiracy to rape and one child prostitution offence;
Taleb Bapir, 39, of Verdon Street, Sheffield, is charged with one count of rape.
Outlining the case in relation to one girl Mr Hampton said she had been befriended by the Whiteley brothers and Mr Francis-Edge after meeting them at Sheffield's former Castle Market.
He said the girl was later taken to a flat in West Street and tied to a chair.
"She was prostituted to men who visited the flat," he said.
"She would tell them she did not want to do it but if she refused she would be subjected to violence by the brothers."
The prosecutor said another girl had been forced to stand on a street corner in Sheffield's red light district by Shane Whiteley as "pay back" for an alleged burglary.
The court heard Miss Spencer was "pimping out" one girl to Christopher Whitely and also took her to an address where she threatened her with violence if she did not have sex with an older man.
Taleb Bapir is said to have paid Miss Spencer Â£60 to have sex with another 15-year-old girl.
The trial continues.
