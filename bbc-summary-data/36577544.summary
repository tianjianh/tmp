The north-south interconnector would connect the two power grids by 138km of overhead lines between Moy in County Tyrone and County Meath.
However, the inquiry will not examine significant issues until later in the year.
The one-day hearing in Armagh on Tuesday will deal solely with "legal and procedural issues".
The inquiry - run by the Planning Appeals Commission - is recommencing after a four-year delay.
It first opened in 2012 but was adjourned when it emerged the planning application and environmental statement had not been properly advertised.
Campaigners want the cables to be put underground for environmental and health reasons.
However, backers of the planning application have said this option would take too long and be "five times more expensive".
In the Republic of Ireland, the state-owned commercial energy company, EirGrid, has submitted plans for the southern half of the project.
In Northern Ireland, the lead is being taken by System Operator for Northern Ireland (SONI).
Its chief executive Robin McCormack said: "The project is an urgent necessity to ensure Northern Ireland has enough electricity to meet demand in the coming years.
"We welcome the recommencement of the public inquiry as we continue to work towards a planning decision for the project," he said.
A final decision on the Northern Ireland planning application will rest with the Minister for Infrastructure, Chris Hazzard.
Twelve weeks of hearings have already taken place in the Republic of Ireland, with a decision on its part of the project due from An Bord Pleanála (the Planning Board) ater this year.
SONI has released an image of how the pylons would look.
