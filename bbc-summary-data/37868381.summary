[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Shane Sutton says he will contest British Cycling's finding that he used sexist language towards Jess Varnish and that "the evidence will prevail".

The former technical director was found to have used "inappropriate and discriminatory language" towards cyclist Varnish in last week's ruling.
Varnish, 25, said Sutton told her to "go and have a baby", which he denied.
"I will produce the evidence," said 59-year-old Sutton. "Everything comes out in the dirty washing."
He added: "I am quite sure the evidence this time will prevail and I will win."
Australian Sutton resigned in April, having been suspended pending the investigation.
Former European team sprint champion Varnish said she was "relieved" by the ruling, while British Cycling expressed its "sincere regret".
Its report will inform the ongoing independent UK Sport review into the culture of British Cycling's world-class performance programme.
"I can categorically state I never made those comments I was originally alleged to have made," Sutton added.
"I'm pretty sure people will be sitting back going: 'Well, he's going to appeal' - which is going to happen now. I will take it from there."
