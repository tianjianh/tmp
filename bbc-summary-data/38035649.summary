[SN]TITLE[SN]
Exeter City 0-0 Luton Town

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Exeter City remain winless at home in the league this season after a goalless draw with Luton Town at St James Park.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Both teams were evenly matched in a first half devoid of clear-cut chances, with Exeter going closest when defender Pierce Sweeney was teed up on the edge of the box, but he drilled his shot wide of the upright.
The game was more open after the break, with Luton's Danny Hylton forcing Christy Pym into a smart stop and the Exeter goalkeeper bettered that to deny Olly Lee after he had been teed up by Isaac Vassell.
The closest either side went was when Exeter's Ollie Watkins turned sharply on the edge of the penalty box and thundered a shot against the crossbar, before the same player drew a smart stop from Christian Walton with another effort moments later.
Luton's best opportunity was an Alan Sheehan free-kick which seemed destined for the top corner before Pym got across his goal to save well.
