Colin Ingram led the home effort with a gritty unbeaten 72, sharing stands of 62 with Aneurin Donald (36) and 78 with David Lloyd (37).
Notts claimed three scalps in the first 20 overs but had to labour hard for wickets.
The visitors still have a full day to record a fourth Championship win.
Ingram reined in his attacking instincts to bat for five hours as Glamorgan dug in stubbornly for much of the day, despite Steven Mullaney's inventive efforts in the field as acting captain.
Lloyd supported Ingram for 42 overs before Luke Fletcher had him caught at slip with the second new ball for his second wicket.
Stuart Broad got through 23 wicket-less overs conceding just 37 runs.
Glamorgan batsman Colin Ingram told BBC Wales Sport:
"We let ourselves down (in the first innings) with the way we played, it's not where we want to be as a team and I wanted to make sure I kept it nice and simple and prepared to grind it out.
"Sometimes you've got to take those options, that's what red-ball cricket teaches you. I like to hit the white ball out of the ground but this was a good lesson for me to stick to a simple plan and grind it out, to see where I can go.
"It was nice to see everyone committed to a stronger performance today and nice to see the way the young guys (Donald and Lloyd) played as well.
"We'll just keep it simple, their bowlers have bowled a lot of overs and the pitch isn't doing too much so if we can keep gutsing it out, you never know where we can go."
Debutant Notts batsman, India's Cheteshwar Pujara, told BBC Radio Nottingham:
"I'm used to fielding for two days, especially in Indian conditions where you expect any team to bat for at least 90 overs. We expected better results today but they batted well, we're still nearly 50 runs ahead and we hope to get five more wickets,
"I'm getting used to the conditions, I had jet-lag initially but I'm over it, I'm getting used to the weather and conditions and hitting a few balls every day so hopefully I don't have to bat in the second innings, but if I do I'll be prepared.
"I knew Samit Patel because he played in 2012 when England toured India, apart from (Patel and Broad) I didn't know many players but they are really friendly and I'm enjoying the dressing-room atmosphere."
