Slovakia v Scotland: Aggression can disrupt hosts - Steven Pressley

Scotland can get a positive result in Slovakia if they employ a high-tempo strategy, says Steven Pressley.

The former international defender watched Slovakia lose in Slovenia on Saturday, providing a report for Scotland boss Gordon Strachan.
"If you allow them to get a rhythm, they can be a very effective team," Pressley told BBC Scotland.
"Slovenia were aggressive out of possession, they pressurised them and didn't allow them to settle."
Slovakia, the second seeds in World Cup qualifying Group F, also lost their opener at home to England, while Scotland have four points after the weekend draw at home to Lithuania.
"They are a team that likes to dominate the ball and Slovenia caused them problems with their intensity," said 42-year-old Pressley.
"They played at a high tempo and Slovakia didn't deal with it."
Having dropping points at Hampden, Strachan's men, like Tuesday's hosts, are under pressure early in the campaign, with England out in front after two wins.
"I wouldn't say it was must-win because of other results," said former Falkirk, Coventry City and Fleetwood Town manager Pressley. "But it's certainly a game we can't lose.
"From speaking to Gordon and his staff, the mentality is to go there and win. The mentality is to go there and impose Scotland on the game.
"A win would certainly be a great platform for the remaining fixtures in the group."
Following the draw with Lithuania, Strachan said he would "shake it up a bit" with regards his team selection.
Strachan's post-match praise for lone striker Chris Martin has attracted some flak, but Pressley, capped 32 times between 2000-06, insisted there was "no real depth" to criticism of the Fulham forward.
"Managers just don't pick a team and hope for the best, there's a lot of thought gone into it," he said.
"There are always reasons why certain players are selected  - and it will be the same on Tuesday."
Pressley was part of the Scotland coaching team under George Burley and laughed off any suggestion of Strachan's position being under threat.
"He's absolutely not under pressure," he added.
"He has proved his ability over many years, so that shouldn't even be talked about.
"He is shaping a new generation of Scotland players and, in years to come, we'll see the benefit of that."
