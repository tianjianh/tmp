The final shelters at the Calais migrant camp have been demolished, bringing an end to the "Jungle" camp in northern France.

The last shelters were demolished late on Monday afternoon, leaving just debris to be cleared.
More than 7,000 migrants lived at the camp before evacuation began on 24 October.
However, fears remain for up to 1,500 minors who were living in containers in the now-dismantled camp.
French President Francois Hollande said on Saturday that those children, who have been living in containers in a special part of the camp, would be moved to accommodation centres soon.
For the time being, they remain in the area, while France and Britain continue to argue over where they will be sent. Charity groups said they have been feeding the children and providing water, due to a lack of official support.

Meanwhile, police moved to clear part of a makeshift migrant camp in Paris which expanded in the days following the closure of the jungle camp in Calais.
An area in the north-east of the city saw numbers sleeping rough jump from around 1,500 to an estimated 2,500 in the last week.
The area in Paris, near Stalingrad and Jean Jaures metro stations, is frequently the site of makeshift camps.
Riot police forced migrants back as some tents were cleared on Monday. Police carried out identity checks and cleared a small area, but left the majority of the camp intact.
It is expected that a wider clearance will take place in the coming weeks.
Officials said some of the growth is likely from the dismantled Calais camps.
On Saturday, President Hollande said he would shut down camps in Paris, saying they were "not worthy" of France.
"We cannot tolerate camps," he said. "We will evacuate the camps in Paris because it cannot be a long-lasting solution."
The city has been dealing with similar migrant camps springing up for months, prompting routine clearances by police.
