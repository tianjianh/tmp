Her Majesty, who had been staying at the Palace of Holyroodhouse, popped into the Sheep Heid in Duddingston on Friday.
The Monarch had earlier been at Musselburgh Racecourse's 200th birthday celebrations.
She is very rarely seen eating out at public restaurants, but the 650-year-old Sheep Heid Inn has been linked to the Royals since the 1500s.
In 1580, King James VI of Scotland gifted the landlord an ornate ram's head snuff box.
It is believed he, and his mother Mary Queen of Scots, stopped by the inn many times to play skittles in the courtyard.
As a mark of gratitude he presented the landlord with the unusual gift which remained on site for 300 years before being sold at auction to the Earl of Rosebery.
A Sheep Heid spokesman said: "I can confirm the Queen was here. " He refused to give details on what she ordered.
However, it has been reported that the Queen and her companions enjoyed two portions of lamb and a fillet of seabass.
