Free school transport rules relaxed in Denbighshire

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Rules for school transport in Denbighshire may be relaxed after criticism from parents.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Parents had raised concerns over the use of hazardous routes and pick-up points in the council's previous policy.
Denbighshire council's scrutiny committee agreed to support a new policy on Thursday.
Councillor Huw Hilditch Roberts said it was more "flexible and considerate to families".
In 2015 parents launched a legal challenge after free taxis for pupils living 12 miles (19km) from Ysgol Brynhyfryd were stopped.
But the possible judicial review was avoided after the council reinstated transport in individual cases.
The revised policy is due to come into effect in September 2018.
