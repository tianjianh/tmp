Mandron had earlier given the hosts the lead with a close-range finish.
Jordan Sinnott's deflected shot put Halifax level, before Scott Garner headed in the visitors' second.
Richard Peniket slotted in to make it 3-1, but Scott Wilson fired home to reduce Eastleigh's deficit and Mandron bundled in his second in added time.
Halifax will be the second lowest-ranked side in the draw for the third round, which takes place on Monday at 19:00 GMT, with Northern Premier League side Stourbridge also in the hat after their game with Peterborough was postponed because of a frozen pitch.
