Welsh number one Mark Williams insists he can beat defending champion Judd Trump in the first round of the World Grand Prix in Llandudno.

Williams lost 4-3 to world number five Trump in the last eight at Venue Cymru in 2015, but feels capable of revenge.
"It's not going to be an easy game but I'm certainly not worried about playing anyone," Williams told BBC Wales Sport.
"I'm probably the outsider but if I turn round and beat him it's not going to be a shock to me."
Two-time world champion Williams will take on Trump on Wednesday at 14:00 GMT.
Trump beat Ronnie O'Sullivan 10-7 in last year's inaugural final in Llandudno but acknowledges he had an "up and down" season.
The 26-year-old from Bristol recently won the Championship League but has only reached the final of one ranking event so far this season, September's Shanghai Masters which he lost 10-9 to Kyren Wilson.
"At times I have produced a game which is good enough to win tournaments, but then I have come up short by a frame or two at important moments," Trump said.
"I've been inconsistent - one day brilliant then the next day average. That consistency is what I'm looking for.
"I'm not getting thrashed by anyone but I've lost a few close matches which could have made it into a really good season. I need to be more clinical under pressure. "
Five-time world champion O'Sullivan won February's Welsh Open at the Motorpoint Arena in Cardiff.
World number 14 Williams feels if the player nicknamed 'The Rocket' shows similar form in Llandudno he'll be extremely difficult to beat.
"If he (O'Sullivan) turns up and plays, there's no-one on the planet who can play anywhere hear him," two-time world champion Williams added.
"If people think they can play to his standard, they're kidding themselves. He'll hang his cue up sooner or later - just everyone enjoy watching him while he's still playing."
O'Sullivan plays his first-round match against Michael Holt on Tuesday evening at 20:00 GMT.
