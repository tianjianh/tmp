James Bond film Spectre has held on to the top spot at the North American box office in its second week of release.

The 24th film in the 007 franchise, starring Daniel Craig, made $35.4m (£23.3m) between Friday and Sunday, according to estimates.
The Peanuts Movie held firm at number two, with takings of $24.2m (£16m).
But the Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt drama By the Sea failed to make a splash, taking just $95,440 (£63,000) at 10 screens.
The European art house film stars the real-life couple as a husband and wife struggling to cope in the aftermath of a trauma.  The film was also directed by Jolie - her third time at the helm of a movie - and the actress also wrote the script.
The drama, which marks the first time the two stars have appeared together on the big screen since Mr & Mrs Smith in 2005, has been generally panned by critics.
Despite its poor takings, its limited release is thought unlikely to hurt its film company, Universal, too much since it was made for a relatively modest budget of $10m (£6.6m).
Spectre's takings fell 50% in its second weekend, bringing its North American total to $130.7m (£86m).
That is well behind the $161m (£106m) earned by its predecessor Skyfall over the same period.
The Peanuts Movie - the family-friendly adaptation of the beloved Charles Schulz comic strip, featuring Charlie Brown and Snoopy -  saw its second weekend takings drop by 45%, bringing its total in the US to $82.5m (£54m).
The rest of the top five saw Love the Coopers, an ensemble comedy about a family gathering starring Diane Keaton and Alan Arkin, enter the chart at number three with $8.4m (£54m).
Old release The Martian dropped one place to number four, while at number five was another new release, The 33.
The film based on the 2010 Chilean mining disaster took $5.8m (£4m) from 2,452 cinemas.
