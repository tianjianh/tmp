Residents are being recruited to spot speeding motorists.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Cumbria Police is looking for volunteer "mobile speed watch operators" in the west of the county.
They will use specialist equipment to monitor vehicles in areas identified as being high risk and educate motorists about the risks of driving too fast.
The pilot initiative was intended to address "the problem of real or perceived speed related offending", the force said.
Ch Insp Matt Kennerley said volunteers were a "valued part of our policing family".
