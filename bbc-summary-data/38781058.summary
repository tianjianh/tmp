The 14-time major champion, playing in his first full PGA Tour event for almost 18 months, carded a level-par second round of 72, but missed the cut by four shots after his first-round 76.
World number one Jason Day and US Open champion Dustin Johnson also missed the cut at Torrey Pines in San Diego.
Overnight leader Rose carded a one-under 71 to put him on eight under.
Canada's Adam Hadwin and USA's Brandt Snedeker are tied in second on seven under, while US PGA champion Jimmy Walker missed the cut as he finished on three over.
Woods is playing in just his second tournament since 15 months out with a back injury.
"It's frustrating not being able to have a chance to win the tournament," said the 41-year-old, who won his last major, the US Open, at the same course in 2008.
"Overall today was a lot better than yesterday. I hit it better, I putted well again. I hit a lot of beautiful putts that didn't go in, but I hit it much better today, which was nice."
Scotland's Martin Laird and England's Paul Casey are both on two under, while Ireland's Shane Lowry is on level par.
