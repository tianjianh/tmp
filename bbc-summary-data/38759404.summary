The clubs are in talks over a move for the 23-year-old, who joined the French champions from Real in August for £21m.
"Jese is a player I have worked with. I know how good he is," said Boro boss Aitor Karanka. "His next move is important. I hope we can convince him."
Karanka also confirmed Boro's interest in Hull midfielder Robert Snodgrass.
Hull have already accepted offers in the region of £10m from Burnley and West Ham for the Scotland international.
"He's a player I like," Karanka said. "The club is working on offers with Hull. I think they rejected an offer from us but we are working."
Karanka also disclosed that Boro have rejected an offer from Leicester for attacker Gaston Ramirez, who has handed in a transfer request.
"It's frustrating as a coach and a person," Karanka said. "He was calling us to play here last season, he got back to his best here, he got back in the national team.
"Nobody is bigger than the team. In the end, if we don't receive the right offer, he will be an important player."
Jese has made nine appearances for PSG, scoring one goal, but has struggled to find a regular place in Unai Emery's side since moving from Real.
He played 63 times for the Spanish giants, scoring 13 goals after emerging through the club's youth system.
"He can bring us a lot of things," said Karanka. "The last five or six months have been difficult for him. He couldn't settle in the way he wanted so he has to be sure."
