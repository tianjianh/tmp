[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Jay Nava, 27, stabbed 26-year-old Natasha Wake 11 times in the chest and neck at her home in Bournemouth in October.
He then fell asleep beside her body, which he later hid in a cupboard under the stairs.
The 27-year-old from Plymouth will be sentenced at Winchester Crown Court on Thursday.
The trial heard that Miss Wake became angry with Nava on the day she died, when she found out that he had been investigated by police for an alleged sexual assault on another woman.
Nava told the court he remembered kneeling over Miss Wake's body with a knife in his hand but could not recall killing her.
The court heard that on the night of the attack on 1 October, one of the children in the house heard a "scream" and went downstairs for a drink.
The girl told police she had seen Nava with a knife and Miss Wake lying on the floor covered by a blanket, although Nava had told her it was a "game".
The following morning Nava confessed to the killing in a phone call to his mother.
Police found Miss Wake's body at the address in Harley Gardens and launched a ground and air search for Nava's car.
The former Commando gunner attempted to take his own life when he was discovered later that day in woodland at Hengistbury Head, Dorset.
Police officers managed to resuscitate him on the scene.
A defence psychiatrist had told the jury Nava suffered an "abnormality in mental function".
Following the verdict, Det Ch Insp Sarah Derbyshire said: "Jay Nava subjected Natasha to a brutal and sustained attack.
"His violent actions that day have very sadly left two young children without their mother."
