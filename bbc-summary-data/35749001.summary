Cardiff City midfielder Stuart O'Keefe says they are looking more and more like play-off contenders after picking up back-to-back Championship victories.

O'Keefe, 25, scored the Bluebirds' second goal in Saturday's 2-0 Severnside derby win at Bristol City.
The result sees Cardiff lying seventh in the table, level on points with sixth-placed Sheffield Wednesday.
"We're starting to get more of a unity together. You can see that with our results," O'Keefe said.
"It's starting to come together now. You never know at the end of the season, pressure gets to people and hopefully we can knick in.
"Hopefully we can put a really good run together and have a right good push towards the end of the season.
"We've got enough quality and team spirit to go on and kick on."
Cardiff, who host Leeds United on Tuesday, have also benefitted from Dutchman Lex Immers' goals since his arrival on loan from Feyenoord in January.
The 29-year-old's goal against Bristol City was his third in six appearances for the Bluebirds.
"He has come in under hard circumstances and he's done very, very well," O'Keefe added.
"He links up well. He's a clever player.
"He finds pockets and he works hard for the team. He's a good addition for us."
