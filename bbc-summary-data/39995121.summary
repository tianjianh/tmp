[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Captain Joe Leach took his season's haul of wickets to 22 as Worcestershire beat Derbyshire by an innings and 42 runs to keep up their winning start.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Derbyshire collapsed to 98 all out to suffer a third successive defeat.
After the visitors declared on 415-9, Ed Barnard took two quick wickets before a brilliant run out to get rid of opener Luis Reece.
Leach then took over either side of lunch, taking 5-32, his third five-for in Worcestershire's last two matches.
Barnard made it three wins from three Division Two matches in 2017 with a boundary catch to end Tony Palladino's late resistance with 28.
After a badly rain-interrupted first two days, Worcestershire set up their final-day win by scoring 92 from 17 overs in the morning, of which Tom Kohler-Cadmore hit 42 and Ben Cox 27 in 25 balls.
Going back to include last season when Steve Rhodes' side finished the summer with two victories, this was Worcestershire's fifth Championship win in a row.
It is their best start to a Championship season since winning their first three matches in 1988 when Rhodes, now coach, was a player.
Aided by Graeme Hick's 405 not out at Taunton, they beat Nottinghamshire, Lancashire and Somerset in their first three games before going on to become county champions.
Derbyshire captain Billy Godleman told BBC Radio Derby:
"To lose a game in the manner in which we did was hugely disappointing
"Especially with time taken out of the game on the first couple of days  It certainly wasn't a 98 all-out wicket."
Worcestershire captain Joe Leach told BBC Hereford & Worcester:
"We couldn't have asked for a better start. We are on the crest of a wave at the moment and we need to make sure we keep on riding it.
"I've learnt over the years that momentum in the four-day game plays a massive part.
"We knew if we could get 140 ahead there would be a lot of pressure on them to defend their wickets and, once you get on a roll, things go for you but we worked really hard over three days to get there."
