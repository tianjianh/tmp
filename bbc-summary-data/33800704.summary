[SN]TITLE[SN]
Pastor James McConnell in court over online 'satanic Islam' sermon

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An evangelical preacher who called Islam "satanic" and "heathen" should have every right to criticise other religions, a court has heard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Pastor James McConnell appeared in court on charges relating to the internet broadcast of a sermon he gave at a Belfast church last year.
Belfast Magistrates' Court was told Pastor McConnell will be denying "moral or legal culpability" on the charges.
Several hundred people gathered outside the court in support of the preacher.
His solicitor said the 78-year-old "did not incite hatred or encourage violence against Muslims".
"He simply expressed his view about another religion, not in a personalised manner but in an entirely generalised way," he added.
Pastor McConnell, of Shore Road, Newtownabbey, is charged with improper use of a public electronic communications network and causing a grossly offensive message to be sent by means of a public electronic communications network.
The remarks were made at the Whitewell Metropolitan Tabernacle in north Belfast in May 2014 and were streamed online.
His solicitor told the court that Pastor McConnell believed freedom of speech "should mean he has every right to criticise Islam and other religions, just as Islamic clerics have the right to criticise him and Christian clerics".
"We are pleading not guilty - a very candid not guilty," the solicitor said.
He added that the case was "one of the most bizarre, peculiar... I have ever seen before these courts".
He asked the prosecution to indicate if any of the four main witnesses in the case were prepared to give evidence against the pastor.
A prosecution lawyer said statements were given to police, with any further contact expected after the defendant's attitude is formally entered.
The defence solicitor added: "There are approximately 1,000 people here, Pastor McConnell is a revered pastor in the greater Belfast area."
The case was then listed for another hearing on 3 September.
