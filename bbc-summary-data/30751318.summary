Cardiff City marked their return to their traditional blue kit with a win against Fulham at Cardiff City Stadium.

The team - known as the Bluebirds - played in blue shirts at home on Saturday for the first time since 2012 after the club's owner agreed to change the colour back from red.
Owner Vincent Tan gave the go-ahead on Friday after a meeting with supporters.
On Saturday, chief executive Ken Choo said fans were "buzzing" just before kick-off amid a carnival atmosphere.
Earlier on Saturday, firefighters were called to the stadium after cladding on the roof of the Ninian Stand came loose after strong winds battered Wales overnight.
The controversial rebrand to red was introduced by Tan after he bought the club but was unpopular with supporters.
The red shirt - introduced in June 2012 to appeal to international markets - will remain as Cardiff's away kit.
The Football League has given its permission for Cardiff to change their playing strip mid-campaign.
The club's badge will also be changed to give the Bluebird mascot more prominence.
In a statement, Tan said his mother had been instrumental in his change of heart over the kit's colour.
"The Christmas and New Year period has given me time to reflect on events of the last year," he said.
"Spending time with my family has had a profound effect upon me, my mother... spoke to me on the importance of togetherness, unity and happiness.
"Cardiff City Football Club is important to me and I wish to see it united and happy."
