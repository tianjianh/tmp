Francisco Guterres was sworn in as president of East Timor in May 2017, pledging to boost health and education.
Commonly known as "Lu Olo", Mr Guterres leads the centre-left Fretilin party and is a former guerrilla, having fought against Indonesia's occupation of East Timor.
He led the draft of the country's first constitution in 2001 and mounted failed bids for the presidency in 2008 and 2012.
