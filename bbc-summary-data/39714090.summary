Celtic striker Moussa Dembele will miss the Scottish Cup final against Aberdeen on 27 May through injury.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 20-year-old suffered a hamstring problem in the first half of Sunday's semi-final win over Rangers.
The France U21 international is expected to be sidelined for up to six weeks during his recovery.
Dembele, replaced by Leigh Griffiths after 34 minutes at Hampden, has scored 32 goals in 49 appearances in his debut campaign since joining from Fulham.
Griffiths, who scored 40 last season but has been a regular on the substitutes' bench this season, has 14 goals in 36 appearances.
Celtic are seeking a domestic treble, having retained the Scottish Premiership title and beaten Aberdeen, who are second top in the league, in the League Cup final.
