The 34-year-old defender played 27 times as the Toffees finished seventh in the Premier League last season.
Everton have made seven new signings this summer and Jagielka now wants to help create "special memories".
"The club is moving forward," said Jagielka. "I do not think the transfer business is finished but it is good we have got people in nice and early."
