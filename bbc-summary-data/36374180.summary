Karius, 22, completed a medical on Tuesday and will officially begin a five-year contract on 1 July.
He said that speaking to Liverpool boss and fellow German Klopp "convinced" him the move was the right decision.
Karius kept nine clean sheets in 34 league games last season as Mainz finished sixth in the Bundesliga.
"I spoke to the manager and I had a good feeling afterwards because he told me what he wants to do with the club and with the players," he added.
The former Manchester City youth team player will provide competition for Belgium international Simon Mignolet, who was first choice last season.
Mignolet, 28, signed a new five-year contract at Anfield in January.
