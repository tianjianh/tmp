The Scottish Championship club say the deal is subject to confirmation of his registration by the Scottish FA.
Stokes, 27, turned down the chance to play in England as well as offers from Dundee United and Inverness CT.
"Anthony is a fantastic footballer and will really strengthen the squad," head coach Alan Stubbs told the Hibs website.
"We have a number of options in attack and real competition for places, which is what every manager wants.
"We are excited about Anthony coming here and I think he will prove to be a real asset."
The Republic of Ireland cap left Hibs for Celtic in 2010 and has also played for Falkirk, Sunderland, Sheffield United, and Crystal Palace, scoring over 120 goals in his senior career.
Hibs are third in the Scottish Championship, five points behind leaders Rangers and level with second-place Falkirk.
Celtic had indicated that they would prefer Stokes to join a top-flight club.
Stokes has fallen out of favour at Celtic under manager Ronny Deila and made his last appearance this season in August.
The player was suspended by Celtic in December after he complained on Twitter about his lack of playing time.
"It will be a fantastic piece of business for the football club and for Anthony," Stubbs told BBC Radio Scotland's Sportsound programme on Monday.
"He's a very, very talented footballer. Yes, he's had one or two issues, but I'm prepared to look over that. The reason we're bringing him to the football club is because of his ability on the pitch.
"I don't think it is a gamble whatsoever. I can't wait to work with him, to be honest.
"I like personalities. I like people who are different and I'm sure he's going to enjoy working with me. I think it could be very good.
"It's significant in the aspirations of the football club."
