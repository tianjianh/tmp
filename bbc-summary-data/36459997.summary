The 23-year-old Arsenal player also missed the 7-0 win against the Serbians at Adams Park on Saturday.
England are a point behind Group Seven leaders Belgium with a game in hand.
Victory in Stara Pazova on Tuesday would move Mark Sampson's side above Belgium at the top of the table and secure a runners-up spot at least for next year's finals in the Netherlands.
The eight group winners and the six best runners-up will join the hosts in an expanded 16-team event.
The other two runners-up will play off in October 2016 for the remaining spot.
England and Belgium meet in the final round of group games on 20 September.
