A coroner's hearing has heard that an army inquiry into two suspected suicides at Ballykinler army base also examined eight other cases of self-harm.

Lance Corporal James Ross, who was from Leeds and served in Afghanistan with the 2nd Battalion the Rifles, was found hanging in his room at the County Down barracks in December 2012.
Two months later, Rifleman Darren Mitchell, who was 20 and also served in Afghanistan, was found hanging at the base.
An inquest into their deaths will begin in January.
A preliminary hearing on Friday heard that both soldiers has concerns about disciplinary issues before their deaths.
Details about the eight additional cases of self harm at the County Down base emerged during legal arguments about information being withheld by the Ministry of Defence (MoD).
The coroner has ordered the MoD to explain, in writing, by next Tuesday, why it should continue to withhold certain information contained in the army inquiry.
