[SN]TITLE[SN]
Wigan Athletic 2-1 Wolverhampton Wanderers

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Wigan moved off the bottom of the Championship table as Will Grigg's late goal gave them victory over Wolves.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The striker latched on to a long ball with two minutes remaining and rounded Wolves goalkeeper Carl Ikeme.
Ex-Wolves striker Adam le Fondre had put Wigan ahead early on, turning in Max Power's cross from close range.
Prince Oniangue equalised for the visitors before the break with a low finish from 18 yards, before substitute Grigg's cool finish won it for Wigan.
The victory for Gary Caldwell's side was their first in nine league matches, their last win coming against Blackburn on 13 August, and sends them up to 21st.
Wolves went into the match following back-to-back wins against Newcastle and Brentford, but failed to produce the same attacking threat at the DW Stadium.
Le Fondre, who spent last season on loan at Molineux, became the third ex-Wolves player to score against his old side in Championship this campaign when he converted the simplest of chances from six yards.
After Congo captain Oniangue slotted into the bottom corner, Danny Batth almost added another for the visitors early in the second half, but his header was cleared off the line.
With the game heading towards a draw, Northern Ireland forward Grigg held off a weak challenge from Batth to give the Latics their second league win of the season.
