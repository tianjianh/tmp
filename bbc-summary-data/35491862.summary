[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Becky's dismembered body was found at Karl Demetrius and Jaydene Parsons' Bristol home, 12 days after she was killed in a sexually-motivated kidnap.
They pleaded guilty to assisting an offender but insisted they did not know what was in the bags they were storing.
Nathan Matthews and Shauna Hoare were jailed last year for killing Becky, Matthews's 16-year-old stepsister.
At Bristol Crown Court, Demetrius, 30, was sentenced to two years and Parsons, 23, jailed for 16 months.
The court heard the pair "could not have imagined" what they were storing for Matthews and believed it to be cannabis or stolen goods.
Recorder of Bristol, Judge Neil Ford QC, told the pair: "The offender you assisted was Nathan Matthews who has been convicted of the murder of Rebecca Watts and other related offences.
"He not only killed Miss Watts but he dismembered her body in preparation for disposal of it.
"You both knew Nathan Matthews but neither of you could have imagined that he was capable of the levels of depravity to which he descended."
During last year's trial of Matthews and Hoare, the jury heard how he suffocated the teenager at her home in the St George area of Bristol while trying to kidnap her.
He then used a circular saw to dismember her body before hiding the parts in a shed. Meanwhile a huge manhunt in Bristol was under way to track her down.
Matthews was sentenced to life in prison and told he would serve at least 33 years. Hoare was jailed for 17 years.
They are appealing against their convictions and sentences.
