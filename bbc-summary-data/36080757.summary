Telling the story of America's birth and founding father Alexander Hamilton in rap and R&B style, judges described it as "a landmark American musical".
In its 100-year history, it is only the ninth musical to win the prize, which is normally given to plays.
Its writer and star Lin-Manuel Miranda said: "To win today... is beyond my wildest dreams. It is a tremendous honour to even be considered."
The win adds to a series of accolades given to the show, which has grossed more than $60m (Â£41.9m) in advance ticket sales and has been sold out for months.
The musical won the 2016 Grammy Award for best musical theatre album, and Miranda was given the 2015 MacArthur Genius Grant.
Its cast, notably multi-ethnic, with its principal roles written for non-white actors, has been watched by the likes of US President Barack Obama, Dame Helen Mirren and Sir Paul McCartney.
Miranda was recognised as a finalist for the prize in 2009, with his debut musical In the Heights.
Previous musicals to win the award include Next to Normal in 2010 and Rent in 1996.
The Pulitzers recognise excellent in the arts and in journalism.
Other winners include The Associated Press, which won the public service award for its probe into labour abuses in the seafood business, and novelist Viet Thanh Nguyen, whose debut The Sympathizer took home the fiction prize.
