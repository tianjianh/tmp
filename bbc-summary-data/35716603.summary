A section of water pipe which flooded homes in West Lothian after bursting twice in less than a week will not be brought back into use.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
About 20 homes were affected by flooding in the Wester Inch estate, Bathgate, on 24 and 27 February.
The 27in (69cm) water pipe served more than 25,000 properties across Bathgate, Blackburn and Livingston.
Scottish Water said it would answer questions at a public meeting in the area on Sunday.
Mark McEwen, Scottish Water's customer service general manager, said: "We have established after detailed analysis and significant changes that we can operate the local water supply network in future without the need to use this particular section of water pipe.
"We also plan to invest in other areas of the water supply network to ensure continuity of supply in the wider West Lothian area.
"We will keep customers updated on our plans, but in the meantime can confirm that the section of water pipe where these bursts occurred will not be used again."
