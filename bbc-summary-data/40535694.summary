'Very bureaucratic' 10-page use-of-force form sparks police complaints

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Police officers in England and Wales have criticised a new 10-page form they have to fill out every time they use any kind of force against someone.

Since April this year officers have had to record a series of details every time they use handcuffs, CS spray or draw a baton.
As Home Secretary, Theresa May promised to get rid of what she described as "grinding" bureaucracy in policing.
One Police Federation official said the new process was "very bureaucratic".
The new rules were announced in March by Mrs May's successor as Home Secretary, Amber Rudd, with the aim of ensuring that police record every encounter involving force.
Ms Rudd said that "when police take the difficult decision to deploy force, it is also vital that the people they serve can scrutinise it.
"These new rules will introduce unprecedented transparency to this important subject and reinforce the proud British model of policing by consent."
But John Apter, chairman of the Hampshire Police Federation, which represents rank-and-file officers, said filling out the 10-page form had proved to be like "writing an exam essay".
Mr Apter said he understood the need to capture data about the use of force, but thought the process was too complex and took too long, especially at a time when police were already over-stretched.
It is "over-engineered", he said.
"I know officers who haven't got the time to fill in the form," he said, adding that in some city forces, such as London's Metropolitan Police, officers might have to fill in six forms on each shift.
He believes a better approach would be to scan officers' pocketbooks and use samples of these to provide and analyse data.
Police forces will begin publishing data from the forms over the next couple of weeks.
The rules require a "use of force monitoring form", administered by the National Police Chiefs' Council, to be completed "as soon as practicable" after any incident involving force.
A separate form must be completed for each person on whom force is used and officers are expected to complete forms for their own constabulary, even if the incident took place in another police force's area.
The forms require full details of the incident, including location, whether officers were themselves threatened or assaulted and what sort of force they used.
Officers are expected to mark a diagram showing what areas of the person's body the force was used on, whether the person was injured and whether medical assistance was offered or provided.
Previously each force was required to provide details of the use of Tasers and firearms, but the new rules also ask for details of the use of batons, spit-guards, dogs, shields, handcuffs and unarmed restraint, as well as irritant sprays such as CS.
Speaking in May 2011, during her six years as Home Secretary, Mrs May promised that her policies would "do away with the bureaucratic accountability of the past. So we will free the police to do their job".
"I have said loud and clear that the days of the bureaucrats controlling and managing the police from Whitehall are over.
"The Home Office will no longer scrutinise and supervise police performance and come up endlessly with new schemes and initiatives."
