[SN]TITLE[SN]
Grimsby Town 2-0 Notts County

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Goals from Omar Bogle and Scott Vernon helped boost Grimsby's League Two play-off hopes with victory against relegation-threatened Notts County.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
It was a one-sided affair in terms of chances created, as the Mariners won at home for only the second time since the end of September.
Midfield duo Jamey Osborne and Chris Clements were handed their debuts and both of them had a hand in Grimsby's opening goal, which Bogle turned neatly into the far corner with his left foot.
As the first half drew to a close, muted appeals for a home penalty were waved away, as wing-back Zak Mills took a tumble.
Upon the restart, Danny Andrew and Mills both went close in quick succession, and at the other end, Richard Duffy headed agonisingly wide.
As the clock ticked by, Vernon tapped into the net, after Mills had crashed against the post, to seal all three points.
It means Grimsby have now won four of their last six league games.
