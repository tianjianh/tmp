Paul Lane was walking alone in the Poldice Valley, near St Day, on Thursday, when he slipped and broke his leg.
His shouting alerted the ramblers from Bristol who called the emergency services.
However, the route was impassable for the ambulance, so they transported Mr Lane out of the valley on their support trailer and he was taken to hospital by the emergency services.
The group, Disabled Ramblers, aims to get mobility-challenged people out into the countryside.
