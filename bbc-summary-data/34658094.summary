[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The number of people using tourist information centres in the Scottish Borders has fallen by more than a fifth over the past five years.

Figures have revealed that footfall at five local VisitScotland facilities has dropped by more than 26,000 since 2010.
The agency claims an increasing number of tourists access information online.
Changes are likely to be made to the visitor centres (VICs) as part of a national review, according to a report to Scottish Borders Council.
It singled out facilities in Jedburgh and Peebles as "fully performing" centres with good footfall.
However there appeared to be little demand for services at Hawick, Melrose and Kelso.
The report also revealed that total booking numbers through VICs in the Borders fell from 738 in 2010/11 to 311 last year.
Senior managers from VisitScotland are expected to be invited to address the council on their plans for information centres in December.
They could include the installation of interactive visitor information screens at locations across the region.
Two have already been put in place in Kelso and the Galashiels Transport Interchange, at a cost of Â£13,000.
More screens are planned for Tweedbank, Stow, Melrose, Hawick and Abbotsford over the next 12 months.
Paula McDonald, VisitScotland's regional director for the Borders, confirmed that a review of "information provision" is underway.
She added: "We will continue working closely with Scottish Borders Council to provide high-quality information and inspiration to more visitors than ever before through the channels that they use the most, connecting them with businesses, and creating growth and jobs across Scotland."
