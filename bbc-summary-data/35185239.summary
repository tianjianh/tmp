River water in Lancashire, Greater Manchester and Yorkshire has reached high levels and some rivers have even burst their banks.
Prime Minister David Cameron said that more troops will be sent out to help and thanked the emergency services for all their hard work.
The Department for Environment Food & Rural Affairs (Defra) has announced that they will send 500 extra troops to help people in the most affected areas.
Environment Secretary Elizabeth Truss has been talking about what is being done to help.
Hundreds of flood warnings and alerts were sent out for England, Wales and Scotland, including more than 20 severe warnings which means there could be a danger to people.
Thousands of homes were left without power and it could stay that way until Monday.
The weather should get better in the next couple of days.
