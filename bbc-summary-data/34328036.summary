[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Derry have appointed 1993 All-Ireland winner Damian Barton as the new Oak Leaf manager on a two-year term.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Barton takes over from Brian McIver, who quit the post after the All-Ireland qualifier defeat by Galway in July.
He said: "I'm honoured to accept the responsibility that goes with this role. I regard it as a privilege and a challenge which I look forward to."
Barton was ratified as manager by the county committee on Tuesday night with his backroom team yet to be confirmed.
The 53-year-old has managed a number of club sides including Ballinderry and Slaughtneil.
"Damian Barton brings a wealth of playing and coaching experience to the position, as well as an in-depth knowledge of Derry football," said the county.
"On behalf of all members, supporters and patrons of Derry GAA, we warmly welcome Damian and wish him every success in his future endeavours."
The county hurling and minor football manager positions are unchanged.
An announcement regarding the U21 football manager will be made at a later date.
