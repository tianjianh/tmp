The stowaways, who are believed to be from Vietnam, were found by Surrey Police as the cars were being carried on a car transporter through Egham.
Nine of those detained were transported to Dover, in Kent, and a juvenile was taken into police custody for social services to help.
The driver was not arrested. The cars had protective covers on the bodywork.
A police spokesman said officers were called to the Egham bypass at 13:00 BST on Wednesday.
He said: "The nine adults were arrested and a juvenile was detained on suspicion of illegal entry into the country.
"The adults were transferred to the UK Visa and Immigration centre in Dover and the juvenile was taken to a custody centre, as a place of safety, to await assistance from social services."
