Thomas' hopes of winning the race were dealt a huge blow when he was caught in a pile-up involving a police motorbike.
Having started Sunday's ninth stage in second place, Team Sky's co-captain is now more than five minutes behind the leader, Movistar's Nairo Quintana.
Welshman Thomas had a precautionary scan on a shoulder injury on Monday.
Having been given the all-clear, the 30-year-old was then able to join his team-mates on a training ride on the Giro's second rest day.
Thomas is 17th overall, five minutes and 14 seconds behind Quintana.
"I'm OK and there's nothing broken. I've had a lot worse injuries and I'll be able to get through it," Thomas told Team Sky's website.
"There's still a lot of racing to be done, whether I go for trying to improve my GC [general classification] position all the way through to Milan, or just try and target a couple of stages.
"I think just take it day by day at the moment, but certainly go 100% tomorrow [in the time trial]."
His co-captain Mikel Landa also had a scan on Monday after being involved in the same crash, and the Spaniard is hopeful of completing the race.
