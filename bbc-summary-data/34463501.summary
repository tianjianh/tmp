Gerrard Kavanagh, 44, of Mayfield Road, Leicester, pleaded guilty to killing Wendy Milligan, 46, on 2 May.
Kavanagh assaulted Ms Milligan by placing her in a choke hold from which she never recovered, Leicester Crown Court was told.
He was sentenced to three years and eight months in prison for the manslaughter of the mother-of-two.
Kavanagh was arrested after telling a friend that he had panicked and left his flat after killing his girlfriend.
Police found Ms Milligan's body after an anonymous phone call telling them a woman was dead in a flat.
Det Insp Simon Shuttleworth said: "This was an unpleasant case that highlights the dangers of excessive drinking.
"He may not have intended to kill her but a reasonable and sober person should know the dangers of such an act."
He added: "Wendy was a mother-of-two and had a loving family who have now lost her. I hope now they can have some closure from this awful experience."
