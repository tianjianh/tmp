Bella, a nine-month-old Lakeland terrier, disappeared while out for a walk in Balgay Park with her owner Sheila Gaughan on Saturday afternoon.
Firefighters have been assisting in efforts to track her, with digging taking place at Balgay Cemetery.
It is thought Bella, who is reddish tan in colour, may have become stuck in a rabbit hole or fox tunnel.
On Monday morning, council workers were using special thermal imaging cameras to check rabbit holes on a hill at the cemetery.
Ms Gaughan has been posting updates on the Missing Pets, Dundee and Angus Facebook page.
On Sunday evening she said: "Am keeping everything crossed that she's still alive and we get her back safe. Really appreciate everything that everyone has done for Bella, there have been people as well as myself looking for her non-stop since she went missing. Say a prayer for her safe return. Thank you all so much."
Sniffer dogs were brought in to try to pick up Bella's trail. They indicated that it led to a disused fox den. A camera was used to try to locate her but was too big for the bends within the tunnels.
Firefighters then assisted park officials with digging but had to suspend efforts when darkness fell.
In a Facebook post, Ms Gaughan added: "I'm just home having still not got her but have left my coat at the entrance in case she finds her way out."
A fire service spokeswoman said: "The Scottish Fire and Rescue Service was called to Balgay Park, Dundee on Sunday 22 January to assist in the search of a missing dog.
"Firefighters worked alongside animal control officers from Dundee City Council searching the area.
"Sadly, the dog was not found and the search was called off due to the deteriorating light."
