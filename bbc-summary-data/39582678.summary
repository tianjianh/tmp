Premier League predictions: Lawro v Sting and his son

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
BBC Sport's football expert Mark Lawrenson is pitting his wits against a different guest each week this season.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Lawro's opponents for this weekend's Premier League fixtures are Sting and his son Joe Sumner, who are both Newcastle fans.
"Football played a big part in my life growing up in Wallsend," Sting told BBC Sport. "The last trophy we won was the Fairs Cup in 1969 and I went to a lot of our home games during that run.
"Bobby Moncur was the captain and he was my hero - he still is.
"My favourite players are from that era - people like Jim Iley, all those old people. Footballers always seemed much older than me, but now they seem like my children. It's strange, it is just an age thing.
"Winning the Fairs Cup is still the best moment I've had as a Newcastle fan - it was fantastic, but we need to win another trophy."
Joe also grew up as a Toon fanatic, although is not a Geordie like his dad.
"I grew up in north London, so it was a strange kind of cultural mix where all my friends were either Tottenham or Arsenal supporters," he said.
"Most of them were Spurs fans so despite supporting Newcastle, who nobody else I knew cared about, I have sort of developed that Tottenham-style dislike of Arsenal - it is them I cannot stand losing to."
You can make your Premier League predictions now and compare them with those of Lawro and other fans by playing the BBC Sport Predictor game.
A correct result (picking a win, draw or defeat) is worth 10 points. The exact score earns 40 points.
All kick-offs 15:00 BST unless otherwise stated.
Tottenham v Bournemouth (12:30 BST)
Tottenham just swatted Watford away last week to make it six league wins in a row and I cannot see Bournemouth stopping them from making it seven.

The Cherries stayed unbeaten in March to climb away from the relegation zone and posed Chelsea a few problems in their last match, but I still watched that thinking that a Blues win was inevitable.
It will be the same story against Spurs this time. Bournemouth are lively coming forward, but under sustained pressure they do not look like they have enough defensively to hold out.
Lawro's prediction: 3-0
Sting & Joe's prediction: 3-1
Crystal Palace v Leicester
Crystal Palace have won five of their past six league games, which has given them a bit of breathing space to the bottom three.
This is a good time for them to play Leicester, who are in between both legs of their Champions League quarter-final with Atletico Madrid.
I thought the Foxes' 1-0 defeat in Spain in the first leg was an OK result, but I would just be wary about them not having scored an away goal - if they concede next week, they are in trouble.

Leicester manager Craig Shakespeare made lots of changes for their last league game, at Everton, with that match in Madrid in mind.
They lost 4-2 at Goodison Park, and were so open. If they play the same way against Palace, they will get punished.
Lawro's prediction: 2-1
Sting & Joe's prediction: 1-2
Everton v Burnley
Burnley beat Everton at Turf Moor in October thanks to a last-minute goal but it is going to be extremely tough for them to repeat that on Saturday.
Since suffering their only home league defeat of the season, against Liverpool in December, the Toffees have won seven league games in a row at Goodison Park, scoring 26 goals and conceding five.
I think Everton's excellent run will continue - and maybe Ross Barkley will deliver the knockout blow.
Lawro's prediction: 2-0
Sting & Joe's prediction: 2-1
Stoke City v Hull City
Stoke are having a shocking time, with four straight defeats.
I see them bouncing back with a win here, though, because Hull are just not the same force on the road.

Only Burnley have a worse away record in the Premier League this season and the Tigers' biggest problem is it doesn't seem too difficult for teams to beat them once they leave the KCOM Stadium.
People are asking what is wrong with Stoke, but a couple of wins and they will be back in the fight for ninth place.
Lawro's prediction: 2-0
Sting & Joe's prediction: 1-1
Sunderland v West Ham
West Ham got the win they needed against Swansea last week and they are one of several sides who have got 36 points, and look like they are safe.

Sunderland are obviously in a completely different situation at the bottom of the table, 10 points from safety.
I actually think the Black Cats will win this game, because they are at home and it is basically the last throw of the dice.
It is like a cup final for Sunderland because they have to win it. Like I have said before, though, they don't just need one victory to save themselves now, they need three or four.
Lawro's prediction: 2-1
Sting & Joe's prediction: 1-1
Watford v Swansea City
Watford were torn apart by Spurs last time out, but they are another team that look like they already have enough points to be safe.
The Hornets have won three and drawn one of their past five league games at Vicarage Road, and it is their home form that has kept them out of trouble.
Swansea, in contrast, have lost their past five games on the road. It seems a long time since they were on the up, although if Fernando Llorente is fit enough to start that would be a massive boost.
It is hard to see Sunderland and Middlesbrough getting out of trouble so the final relegation spot is between Swansea and Hull.
On current form, I'd back the Tigers to survive but there is time for that to change as well.
Lawro's prediction: 2-1
Sting & Joe's prediction: 2-1
Southampton v Man City (17:30 BST)
Southampton picked up a decent point when they went to Etihad Stadium in October. They deserved it too.
I predicted a 3-0 win for Manchester City over Hull last week, and would have been right if Claudio Bravo hadn't let me down with his late mistake that allowed the Tigers to score.
I am going for a City clean sheet again this time, though, and another victory.
Lawro's prediction: 0-2
Sting & Joe's prediction: 1-2
West Brom v Liverpool (13:30 BST)
Jurgen Klopp made a late change against Bournemouth that I thought actually helped the Cherries fight back for a point.
Then he essentially left his front six out against Stoke, but at half-time of that game thought 'woah, this isn't right.' He sent the cavalry on with the Potters ahead and it worked - the Reds won 2-1 and could have scored more in the end.

Klopp will have to get his selection right this time but I fancy Liverpool to get a win here.
West Brom have just started to struggle for goals again and, with no wins in four, there is a danger their season could peter out.
Lawro's prediction: 0-2
Sting & Joe's prediction: 1-3
Man Utd v Chelsea (16:00 BST)
Manchester United were in action on Thursday in the Europa League and are struggling for numbers a little bit.
Chelsea, meanwhile, have had the week off after their win at Bournemouth last weekend - this is where not being in European competition makes a massive difference.
With United boss Jose Mourinho saying his side's best chance of making the Champions League is by winning the Europa League, you would expect him to play his strongest side against Anderlecht, who they play either side of this game.
I was tempted to go for a draw but, because of United's schedule, I am going to back Chelsea to take another step towards the title.
Lawro's prediction: 0-2
Sting & Joe's prediction: 1-2
Sting was impressed to hear United fans have used one of his songs for their chant about Henrikh Mkhitaryan.
United fans sing "Whoa Mkhitaryan, Henrikh Mkhitaryan, he's our midfield Armenian" to the tune of Englishman in New York.
"I am very happy about that," Sting said. "I like to see songs repossessed and refitted for different purposes. It is pretty good too.
"As a songwriter I think it is extraordinary the way those chants go around a massive group of people, and suddenly they are all singing the same thing."
Middlesbrough v Arsenal (20:00 BST)
Arsenal were all over the place against Crystal Palace last time out, but Middlesbrough will not cause them anywhere near the same sort of problems.
Palace and Boro are poles apart, and quite a few points apart now too.
Laurent Koscielny and Petr Cech could be back from injury, which will help the Gunners at the back, but I would expect them to win this game anyway.
Lawro's prediction: 0-2
Sting & Joe's prediction: 2-2
Lawro was speaking to BBC Sport's Chris Bevan.
*Does not include scores from postponed games.
Lawro's best score: 140 points (week 22 v James McAvoy)
Lawro's worst score: 20 points (week 28, but only five games played so far) or 30 points (week four v Dave Bautista)
From last week's Premier League games, Lawro got five correct results, with no perfect scores, from 10 matches for a total of 50 points.
He was beaten by  singer-songwriter Amy Macdonald, who got seven correct results with no perfect scores, for a tally of 70 points.
