US election: Artist builds wall around Trump's Hollywood star

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Donald Trump's controversial call for a "great, great wall" on the US-Mexico border has yet to be realised but a tiny, tiny one has been built instead - surrounding his star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.

The 15cm high concrete wall is topped with razor wire, miniature US flags and includes 'Keep Out' signs written in both Spanish and English.
It was created by LA-based street artist Plastic Jesus and was inspired by comments made by the Republican Presidential nominee last year when he outlined plans to build a wall along the US-Mexico border to stop illegal immigrants.
Curious tourists snapped photographs of the Los Angeles structure, while a picture of the unusual artwork posted on the artist's Instagram account received more than 14,000 likes by Thursday morning.
One person called the wall "the most genius vandalism of the star yet," while another said it was the "best thing I've seen all day."
There were also those who were unimpressed by the Trump-attacking artwork, with one user exclaiming that "A Trump presidency is what the US needs."
In an interview with the BBC, Plastic Jesus explained why he had built the 'wall':
"I wanted to create a piece that drew attention to [Trump's] potential policies," he says. "I knew this week was the republican convention and I suppose I was capitalising on the momentum of the convention."
And so, on Tuesday afternoon he took his tiny wall made from wood and concrete, and placed it on top of Donald Trump's star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.
He says the response to his wall has been largely supportive. "I went to Hollywood Boulevard yesterday to take photographs and found myself in an absolute bottleneck of people taking photographs of the piece - it's been absolutely crazy."
The artist, who emigrated to the US from the UK nine years ago, says he's not a fan of Donald Trump, "In the US you'll interact with immigrants from all over the world and it's one of the things that makes the US so great. Donald Trump's policy proposals are a threat to all of the immigrants."
Donald Trump received the 2,327th star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 2007 for his work on America's The Apprentice.
