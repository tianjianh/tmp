Jaap Stam is staying "realistic" over Reading's Championship promotion credentials despite a fourth successive victory and climbing to third.

A 3-0 home win against Burton on Saturday also produced a fourth successive clean sheet for the Royals.
"I know people get happy about results and want to go up as quickly as they can," Stam told BBC Radio Berkshire.
"But, there's still lots of games to be played. We're not looking at the table, we're looking from game to game."
Reading have not been third in the Championship for more than a year, but Stam is still searching for consistent performances.
"We're working very hard in training at getting results and thinking of certain plans for the opposition," he added.
"Up to now, it's going quite well, but during the season there's probably going to be a couple of games where it's going to be difficult and we'll have to deal with that too.
"I understand why people might question my approach, but we have to be realistic in what we bring to the game every time.
"We need to work hard to get results and everyone needs to be switched on and focused in that."
