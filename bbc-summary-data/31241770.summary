The lucky astronauts on board the International Space Station have caught the Northern Lights touching sunrise over Earth.
US space agency Nasa released the stunning clip, with the quote from astronaut Butch Wilmore: "#Sunrise touches #Aurora. All we need now are angels singing."
The Northern Lights, or Aurora Borealis, are caused by the interaction of the solar wind (charged particles escaping the Sun) with the Earth's magnetic field and atmosphere.
Pictures courtesty of Nasa.
