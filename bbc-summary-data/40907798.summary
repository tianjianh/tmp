Jarrod Bowen had given the Tigers the lead 10 minutes before half-time against the run of play.
QPR substitute Matt Smith levelled from Luke Freeman's ball in, after Sylla had seen an effort hit the post and cannon behind off Hull keeper Allan McGregor.
Sylla then popped up to finish off after Conor Washington's shot had looped into his path.
There was still time for Hull to go close to earning a share of the points, but Smith was on hand again as he cleared Michael Hector's header off the line.
QPR had made most of the early running and Freeman should have put them ahead but fired wide from 10 yards.
Hull made the most of that let-off when Bowen - who had earlier been denied by Alex Smithies - grabbed his second goal in four matches, converting David Meyler's cross.
Smith's introduction gave the QPR attack a new focal point and he had already manufactured a couple of headers on goal before finding the net from Freeman's cross.
Rangers' winner also came from the direct route, as Smithies, who also brilliantly denied Seb Larsson, launched a ball to Washington, who lofted it over McGregor for Sylla to profit.
Queens Park Rangers manager Ian Holloway:
"They are in a great place at the moment. That was character. James Perch did his knee and I wanted him to come off and he wouldn't come off.
"I should be happy about that but part of me wants to tell him off for not doing as he was told. It shows the spirit we've got.
"They're learning as a group and I'm loving what they're doing at the moment. I think our identity's coming. It won't be the best looking at times but we're going to build a name for ourselves for not giving in."
Hull City boss Leonid Slutsky:
"It is very hard for us because we lost players before this game and now we have lost two more.
"Of course I am very disappointed. It's a very difficult time for us - a very difficult period.
"We played with maximum energy and showed willpower, but it is a very difficult time. We will keep on fighting."
