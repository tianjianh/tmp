Takata president to step down after airbag safety recalls

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The president of Japanese airbag manufacturer Takata is to step down, amid widespread criticism of how the company handled recent safety crises.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Stefan Stocker presided over the firm during a period in which Takata airbags were linked to the deaths of five people.
Additionally, concerns that some of Takata's designs may be defective have led to widespread recalls.
Since 2008, an estimated 24 million cars have been recalled worldwide.
Under certain conditions, Takata airbags can be set off with too much explosive force and potentially fire out metallic shrapnel.
The company has been heavily criticised by regulators in the United States for its slow response to the problems, which first came to light six years ago.
Takata says Mr Stocker is stepping down in order to speed up the decision making process within the company. His role will be taken over by the current chairman, Shigehisa Takada.
