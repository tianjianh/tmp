[SN]TITLE[SN]
Motherwell striker Louis Moult 'very grateful' for interest

Louis Moult says he always viewed Motherwell as a path to bigger things, but insists he will only consider leaving when a bid for him is accepted.

Aberdeen failed last week with an approach for the 25-year-old striker.
"If clubs are interested it's a compliment," said Moult. "In terms of bids and people being interested I'm very, very grateful.
"But it's the club's decision. I've got another year on my contract and they pay my wages."
The former Stoke City trainee moved to Fir Park from Wrexham in 2015 and has been top scorer in his two seasons with the Steelmen, netting 18 goals in each campaign.
Moult is recovering from groin surgery and while he insists he is confident of being a success should he join a bigger club, he is not agitating for a move.
"It would be wrong for me to go and kick their door down if they value me a little bit more," he added.
"I have come up here, worked hard, scored a few goals and people are interested. I'm very, very grateful, whether I am at this football club or another. This club have been unbelievable for me in terms of my profile and the people have been fantastic for me.
"The manager at the time, Ian Barraclough, sold the club to me as a stepping stone. That's what the club is.
"I believe I can score goals wherever I go. If someone pays money and the board feel that it's going to help the football club move forward financially, then I think I have done well."
Motherwell have tabled a contract extension that would make Moult the best paid player at the club, but he admits the talks have not progressed in recent months.
"It's kind of stood still a little bit. I think the negotiations started at Christmas. A lot has gone one since then, [former manager] Mark McGhee left, Stephen Robinson came in, a lot of new players came in.
"It's a difficult one for myself to sign right now."
