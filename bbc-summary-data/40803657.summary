Moore joined the Royals from Leicester for an undisclosed fee in June 2016 and made 47 appearances last season.
The 24-year-old had three years left on his previous deal.
"Anyone who saw him play last season would have seen how much of a driving force he was in our team," manager Jaap Stam told the club website.
