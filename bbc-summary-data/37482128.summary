Outdated microchip details leave thousands of dogs unclaimed

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Hundreds of lost dogs in kennels in Wales face being destroyed as their owners have not kept microchip up-to-date, a charity has claimed.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A survey by Dogs Trust in Wales found 3,222 were unclaimed in council kennels between April 2015 and March 2016.
Of these 243 faced being put down because their microchip details were out-of-date.
But the number of stray and abandoned dogs in Wales fell by 20% between 2015 and 2016.
The charity said despite the fall, the number of dogs who would never go home was "heartbreaking"  and many could be easily reunited with their owners if the details were right.
Microchipping became compulsory in Wales in April 2016, with owners facing a Â£500 fine if they break the law.
