Exeter City 1-2 Cambridge United

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Exeter slipped into the bottom two of League Two as they were beaten 2-1 by Cambridge at St James Park.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Grecians made a terrible start and it was their own doing as they fell behind on seven minutes.
Goalkeeper Christy Pym saw a clearance charged down by Luke Berry and he ran out to atone for his error.
Pym then got in the way of team-mate Luke Croll, the two Exeter players leaving the ball for each other, and Berry took full advantage to nip in and roll the ball into the net from 25 yards.
On 10 minutes it was 2-0 and down to more awful defending. A long ball into the box was not dealt with and Harrison Dunk lashed a low shot past Pym from 18 yards.
Pym made a brilliant stop to deny Leon Legge and Cambridge substitute Adam McGurk dragged a shot wide after more error-prone Exeter defending.
Substitute Joel Grant gave Exeter hope when he headed in from Craig Woodman's cross on 73 minutes and Lee Holmes came close to an equaliser late on only for his short to be superbly blocked.
