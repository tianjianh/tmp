The Bigelow Expandable Activity Module, or Beam for short, is headed for the International Space Station.
It looks like a giant pillow and, when fully inflated in space, it will be large enough to hold a car.
Astronauts will test the module, which is designed by Nasa and Bigelow Aerospace, for two years to see how it holds up.
