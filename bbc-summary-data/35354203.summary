More people are being diagnosed with cancer in Wales but survival rates are at an all-time high, a report has said.

Between 2013-14, 19,000 patients were diagnosed - an increase of 11.5% compared with 10 years ago.
The annual report, on behalf of the Welsh government, also found more people than ever are being treated.
But it said late diagnosis was still problematic and "too many" were diagnosed when admitted in an emergency.
Waiting time targets are also being missed, however, there was a 28% jump in the number of people starting treatment within the 62-day target between 2014-15 compared to five years ago.
For the first time, more than 70% of people diagnosed now live for at least a year and more than 50% for five years.
Meanwhile, the death rate for the under-75s has fallen by 14% in the last decade.
But there are great variations between cancer types - with lung cancer the biggest killer - and rates are 23% higher in the most deprived areas.
The Welsh government said it would prioritise improving access to diagnostic tests, improve community cancer services and implement a single cancer pathway for patients.
Deputy Health Minister Vaughan Gething said: "The Welsh NHS has again made tremendous progress in the diagnosis and treatment of cancer.
"But there is no room for complacency when in Wales, in 2016 alone, almost 20,000 people will be diagnosed with cancer and around 8,000 will die. I look forward to seeing further progress being made in the fight against cancer."
NHS Wales chief executive Dr Andrew Goodall said: "There are numerous excellent examples of cancer services improving throughout Wales.
"We already know the overwhelming majority of people have a positive experience of cancer care here but our priority must be to achieve even better outcomes."
