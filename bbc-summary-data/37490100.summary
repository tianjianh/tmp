Operation Phobos: £19m Swansea-Liverpool drug gang jailed

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A 19-strong gang which ran about £19m worth of cocaine into south Wales has been jailed.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Groups from Liverpool, Manchester and the Swansea area produced and supplied high-purity cocaine to communities such as Pembrokeshire and Carmarthenshire.
Liverpool ringleader Ian Edwards was given 14 years and Matthew Roberts, who headed the Welsh group, got 12 years.
Sentencing at Swansea Crown Court, Judge Paul Thomas QC said they brought "misery and debt to people".
Dyfed-Powys Police launched Operation Phobos - its largest drugs operation - to tackle the supply.
At least four police officers are expected to be commended for "very impressive, intelligent, carefully-directed work" in breaking up the conspiracy, with 2.7kg cocaine seized.
The court heard how gangs in Milford Haven and Swansea linked up with even larger gangs in Liverpool and Manchester to flood the areas with cocaine.
Detectives from west Wales then found themselves investigating a third conspiracy in Scotland.
By the time arrests were completed the gang had run £18.5m worth of cocaine into south Wales, £67,520 of cocaine into Milford Haven and £286,000 of cocaine and cannabis into Scotland.
The police investigation centred on a group headed by 32-year-old Roberts, from Llanelli, who was operating the supply in Wales.
Edwards, 30, was identified as the head of the Liverpool team supplying the Welsh gang led by Roberts who used "sophisticated" techniques to evade detection.
But police managed to insert a listening probe at a property in Vera Road, Clydach, and incriminating information began flowing in.
Soon the same force launched Operation Pigeon when it became clear Edwards and others were also supplying Leigh Salter, described in court as the head of an organised crime gang in Milford Haven.
Salter was jailed in June for five years and four months.
A third operation was later started when evidence emerged of Edwards sending cocaine and cannabis to Aberdeen, in Scotland.
The three investigations were handled by Dyfed-Powys Police.
