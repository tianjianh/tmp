Barnet took the lead in the 27th minute after Tom Davies handled the ball in the area, enabling John Akinde to stroke the penalty home.
Pompey hit back in the 34th minute after a perfectly weighted pass from Gary Roberts found Chaplin in the area, who made no mistake in firing past Josh Vickers.
Roberts then scored his sixth goal of the season in the 50th minute, turning defender Michael Nelson before smashing the ball into the roof of the net.
Carl Baker added the third for Pompey six minutes later as, after cutting in from the right-hand side, he ran into the area and then curled the ball into the back of the net.
Barnet defender Bira Dembele was sent off in the 64th minute after tugging Chaplin down in the box but Roberts failed to beat Vickers from 12 yards.
Substitute Milan Lalkovic then scored his first goal of the season in the 78th minute after curling his shot into the bottom corner.
Danny Rose completed the rout in the 92nd minute after the Barnet defence was cut open, leaving the midfielder to slot the ball home.
