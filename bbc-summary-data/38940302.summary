[SN]TITLE[SN]
Shrewsbury Town 2-1 AFC Wimbledon

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Aristote Nsiala headed a last-minute winner as Shrewsbury boosted their chances of staying in League One by beating AFC Wimbledon.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The central defender powered home a header from Shaun Whalley's corner to seal a fourth successive home win for Paul Hurst's side.
Wimbledon applied much of the early pressure, forcing a number of corners, but chances were initially in short supply at either end.
Tom Elliott was first to threaten with an overhead kick off target for Wimbledon before Shrewsbury striker Freddie Ladapo's low 20 yard shot was comfortably gathered by visiting goalkeeper James Shea.
Wimbledon almost took the lead on the stroke of half time but a powerful 25 yard shot from midfielder Tom Soares cracked against a post.
The visitors struck the woodwork again early in the second half, Elliott denied by the bar from close range, and then home keeper Jayson Leutwiler had to be alert to keep out a shot from Soares.
Shrewsbury broke the deadlock in the 65th minute when a 25-yard free-kick by Tyler Roberts, on loan from West Brom, took a deflection on its way in.
Wimbledon were level within four minutes as Andy Barcham's low shot from 15 yards beat Leutwiler at his near post for the London club's first away goal in League One in nearly 13 hours of football.
But Shrewsbury had the final word with Nsiala's first goal for the club wrapping up three more points.
