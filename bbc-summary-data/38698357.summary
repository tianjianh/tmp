The 22-year old, who is the younger brother of Tottenham and England defender Danny, most recently played for Mansfield Town.
"It is widely known that I want to add to our midfield options and Mitch is an ideal recruit," Westley explained.
"He is youthful yet experienced. And he adds to our options and brings a huge ambition with him here in South Wales."
