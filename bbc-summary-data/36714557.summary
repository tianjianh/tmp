[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Wales' players have been asked not to bring their children onto the pitch after Wednesday's Euro 2016 semi-final because it is "not a safe place".

Fans have been delighted by images of players including Gareth Bale, Hal Robson-Kanu and Ashley Williams celebrating with their children in their victorious run to the last four.
However Uefa said: "It is a European Championship, not a family party."
Wales, who beat Belgium 3-1 in the quarter-final, face Portugal in Lyon.
Tournament director Martin Kallan said: "A stadium is not the most safe place for small kids if fans invaded the field, and with stadium staff operating machinery on the playing surface."
A Uefa official said: "It is nice pictures. We are not 100% against it but we are cautious."
Pictures of Gareth Bale holding his daughter Alba on the pitch following Wales' defeat of Northern Ireland were splashed across conventional and social media, and his team-mates followed suit after Wales' victory over Belgium last week.
