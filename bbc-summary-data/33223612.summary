Sue Lloyd-Roberts 'confident' after BBC donor appeal

BBC journalist Sue Lloyd-Roberts has said she is "very confident" of finding a stem-cell donor following a BBC-led appeal.

Lloyd-Roberts has acute myeloid leukaemia and is dependant on a stem-cell transplant to survive.
The BBC is holding an open day on Monday for anyone aged 16-30 to volunteer as a possible donor.
Lloyd-Roberts has worked for ITN and the BBC, making her name in foreign affairs.
She has reported on events in Syria, Burma and North Korea among many others, and has campaigned for human rights.
Lloyd-Roberts told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme she had been "really encouraged" by the number of people attending the open day.
Held in the BBC's New Broadcasting House in central London, it hopes to encourage 16- to 30-year-olds to join the register of the blood cancer charity Anthony Nolan Trust by supplying a saliva sample. It is open to the public as well as BBC staff.
Lloyd-Roberts's chances of surviving the disease rest on a transplant.
"My prognosis is very grim. So I'm counting on one," she said.
But she added she was "very confident" that a successful donor would be found with the assistance of the charity.
Until then, she said, her "life is on hold".
"You feel as though you're in limbo. You really can't plan anything," she told Derbyshire.
"The kind of work I do for the BBC tends to be long-length investigative films, which can take two months to do. So clearly my work is on hold.
"I really want to remain optimistic, but it's a strange period.
"You can't work, you can't live a normal life, I could have to go to the hospital any day."
But she added that despite "this killer disease in my body", she currently felt "physically fine".
"This is what is so insidious and maddening about it," she said.
Since being diagnosed four months ago, Lloyd-Roberts has undergone two rounds of chemotherapy at University College Hospital in London, and is now in remission.
She had expected a stem-cell transplant to take place in May, but the would-be donor failed medical tests and the operation was cancelled.
"It was a major disappointment," she said.
"I had my bags packed and was ready to go into hospital when the call came the day before I was due to go in, saying that the donor had failed his medical."
Of the 25 million names on the Anthony Nolan Trust register, only three potential donors had been identified - with all three later ruled out.
The charity says that only one in about 1,200 people on the register ends up donating in any given year. Because there are many thousands of different tissue types, matches can be rare.
Those unable to attend the BBC open day can sign up on the Anthony Nolan Trust website.
