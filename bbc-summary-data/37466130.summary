Graffiti referencing the Ibrox disaster and former player Ian Durrant was scratched into the paintwork of the coach in the early hours of Sunday.
The sides later played each other in a league clash at Pittodrie which Aberdeen won 2-1.
Officers said their inquiries were at an early stage and appealed for information.
In separate incidents, there were three arrests during the match.
