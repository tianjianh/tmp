[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Telford's police chaplain, investigated after speaking out about child sex exploitation, has returned to his role.

The Rev Keith Osmund-Smith, who also leads a team of street pastors, took a sabbatical as police investigated if the two roles were compatible.
He had told a national newspaper he doubted if information passed to West Mercia Police officers about child sex exploitation was always acted on.
Police said some "internal recommendations" had been made.
Mr Osmund-Smith, who is also Telford and Wrekin Council chaplain, was quoted in the Daily Mirror article in August saying lots of reports about child sex exploitation were sent to senior officers.

"Because it was going to so many people, no-one was really taking responsibility for it," he said.
Ch Supt Charles Hill of West Mercia Police said: "Rev Osmund-Smith plays a valuable role as police chaplain and he will continue to provide pastoral care, support and guidance to officers and staff in Telford as well as continuing his co-ordinator role for Telford street pastors amongst his other chaplaincy roles."
A spokeswoman for West Mercia Police said the recommendations included "refreshing the Volunteer Task Profile for police chaplains in consultation with our existing chaplains".
"There will also be a change in line management for force chaplains, they will now be managed locally in the policing area where they work to improve briefing and understanding of the local issues," she added.
