[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A rise in the National Living Wage (NLW) is to be announced in the Autumn Statement, which Stormont also hopes will deliver extra infrastructure cash.

Finance Minister Máirtín Ó Muilleoir has called for "austerity to be binned".
But he accepts the Northern Ireland Executive may have to make do with additional funding for roads.
Ahead of Chancellor Philip Hammond's statement, the Treasury has said the NLW will rise by 30p to £7.50 in April.
About 13,000 Northern Ireland workers are thought to have benefited when it was first introduced this year at £7.20 an hour.

This is the chancellor's first major economic policy statement since the vote for Brexit.
But do not expect anything too dramatic.
Phillip Hammond has warned that the UK's debt is still "eye-wateringly" large and that his plans must be "responsible".
That suggests he sees little scope for increasing spending or cutting taxes.
However, there is likely to be a modest increase in infrastructure spending - that would mean tens of million of pounds extra for projects in Northern Ireland.
There will also be measures for what Prime Minister Theresa May describes as families which are just about managing.
But there's unlikely to be a radical reversal of the benefit cuts announced by the last government.
Mr Hammond is also set to make "a significant investment into universal credit", which replaced job seekers' allowance and work-related benefits.
Universal Credit is due to be phased-in for claimants in Northern Ireland next year.
Another measure already heavily trailed is a £1.3bn package for road improvements - targeted mostly at repairs and reducing bottlenecks.
Northern Ireland's spilt of that funding could be about £40m.
But Mr Ó Muilleoir has said UK infrastructure stimulus measures of up to £15bn are needed.
"They [the government] need to invest in infrastructure to give the economy a jolt," he said.
"I hope we see a large stimulus. A Niagra Falls stimulus. Not a garden hose stimulus."
The Autumn Statement presents the government with its first major opportunity to address budget issues since the referendum vote.
It is Mr Hammond's first Autumn Statement since becoming chancellor.
It has already been suggested the government is facing a £100bn black hole in its finances over the next five years due to Brexit.
