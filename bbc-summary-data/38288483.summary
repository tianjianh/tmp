The 33-year-old, who had two years of his previous contract to run, made his debut for the New Road side in 2005.
Mitchell also spent six years as county captain before being replaced by Joe Leach in September.
"Daryl is a mature player in all formats," said director of cricket Steve Rhodes.
"We haven't got lots of very experienced players like Mitch, so to secure his future for the next four years I think is really key for the club going forward.
"He also is in a time when he can now focus totally on his batting and senior role within the group."
Mitchell added: "It's always been my aim to be a one club man and stay here and another four years is fantastic. I'm really pleased."
