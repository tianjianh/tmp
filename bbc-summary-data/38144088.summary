[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A terminally ill boy may die before he qualifies for funding to help improve his quality of life, his parents have said.

Stanley Murphy, who is nearly two, has Tay-Sachs disease which means he is unable to move and has seizures.
His parents said they need a specially adapted car to take him out but warned he may not live until the funding threshold of three years old.
The Department of Work and Pensions said it cannot make exceptions.
His parents, from Newton Abbot in Devon, had applied for funding to buy a car capable of carrying a wheelchair under the Disability Living Allowance mobility scheme.
But their bid was rejected because of Stanley being too young to qualify.
Emma Murphy said: "I don't think the people who make these decisions have a clue what life is really like when you have a poorly child.
"Stanley might not live until he is three so to be told that he can't get this help that he needs until he is three is not right.
"There are lots of children who unfortunately have very short lives, then you don't have time on your side.
"You want to make the best out of every day and to get out and about is a massive part of that.
"We want to give him the quality of life he deserves while he is with us."
A spokeswoman for the Department of Work and Pensions said they were "unable to consider entitlement" as the age limit is the law and not a regulation.
She said applications can be made three months before the child's third birthday so that if approved the benefit can be paid on the day of the birthday.
