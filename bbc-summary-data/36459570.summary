A 13-year-old boy died after an airgun pellet became lodged in his neck, an inquest has heard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Ben Wragge, from Great Ashfield, Suffolk, was fatally wounded at a friend's house in Thurston on 1 May.
The friends had been passing the airgun around when the pellet hit the left side of the boy's neck, police said.
Ben, described by his school as a "mature and intelligent young man", was confirmed dead in hospital later that afternoon. Inquiries are continuing.
The inquest into his death, in Bury St Edmunds, heard nearby residents tried to administer first aid to Ben until an ambulance arrived at 13: 35 BST.
He was taken to West Suffolk Hospital but was pronounced dead at 14:57 BST.
A post-mortem examination carried out at the time of his death found he died from a single wound caused by an air pellet.
The inquest was adjourned until 28 November.
Two teenagers arrested on suspicion of manslaughter have been released on police bail until 16 June.
