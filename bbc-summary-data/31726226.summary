[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The eastern European man arrived at Luton Airport, near junction 10 in Bedfordshire, on Tuesday and was on the hard shoulder heading for London.
Beds, Cambs and Herts Road Policing Unit tweeted that he left at junction nine for Flamstead. He was given "words of advice" and told to avoid motorways.
In October 2013, a cyclist who used the M1's hard shoulder in Hertfordshire was called a "dummy" by police.
