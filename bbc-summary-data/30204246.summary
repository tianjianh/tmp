Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho believes his team's "perfect" performance in the 5-0 Champions League win at Schalke is one of the club's finest away performances.

The Blues thrashed ex-boss Roberto Di Matteo's side to qualify for the last 16 with one Group G game remaining.
"I don't remember Chelsea playing this way away from home," Mourinho said.
"Obviously, there have been great wins away from home with me, Roberto and other managers. But this was very impressive. Very complete."
The Premier League leaders, who are now unbeaten in 19 matches across all competitions, continued their fine form with a clinical performance in Germany.
Chelsea led 3-0 at half-time after goals from John Terry, Willian and Schalke defender Jan Kirchhoff, before Didier Drogba and Ramires completed the rout in the final 15 minutes.
"I think they have to accept we were too strong for them," added Mourinho, whose side inflicted Schalke's first home defeat since April.
"When you lose against a team that produces a perfect performance and a perfect result it's not your fault."
The Portuguese boss, 51, added: "At this moment we are a good team. Obviously we can lose and a bad result is waiting for us but the team is playing really well and we have big self-belief."
Di Matteo, who coached the Blues to Champions League success in May 2012, said the result was the most painful he had suffered in his managerial career.
"It is certainly a disappointing night for us in terms of the scoreline, and also the way we played," said the Italian, who was sacked by the Blues six months after leading them to the European title.
"But we did play against a really great team. If you concede too much space and time to those players, they'll exploit that."
