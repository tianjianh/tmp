The biggest riser was the world's biggest cruise ship operator, Carnival, whose shares rose 3% to £41.45.
Higher ticket prices and greater onboard spending by customers had boosted its quarterly revenues and profits.
Lloyds bank shares rose 2% to 64p after it bought the MBNA credit card firm.
Lloyds paid £1.9bn in its first acquisition since the financial crisis in 2008.
Other significant risers were Barclays bank, up 2.5% to £2.28 per share, and the Prudential insurance company, up 2% to £15.93 per share.
On the currency markets, the pound fell 0.3% against the dollar to $1.235, and was 0.2% lower against the euro at €1.189.
