The country's President Htin Kyaw visited the area on Thursday to see the damage and discuss how to repair it with local officials.
Bagan's spectacular plain has more than 2,200 pagodas, temples, monasteries and other structures on it, most left over from the city's heyday in the 11th-13th century, when it was the capital of the regions that went on to form modern Myanmar.
