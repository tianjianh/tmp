The replica of the 1936 car used in the 1968 children's film could fetch up to £350,000 at the sale, to be held on 12 September at Goodwood in West Sussex.
Other cars up for grabs include a rare 1966 Ferrari 275, estimated to fetch between £2.6m and £2.9m.
Evans will also put 140 lots of auto-memorabilia up for sale.
Proceeds from the memorabilia part of the auction will be donated to the BBC's Children in Need charity.
Bonhams' Sholto Gilbertson said Evans would be auctioning 13 "incredible" cars, including six "outstanding" Ferraris.
Evans' love of cars spawned the annual CarFest event in Cheshire. The Radio 2 DJ was confirmed as the new host of Top Gear in June following the corporation's decision not to renew Jeremy Clarkson's contract.
The original Chitty Chitty Bang Bang car fetched a reported $805,000 (£516,171) when it was auctioned in California in 2011.
