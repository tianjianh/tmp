Trump inauguration: What the president's supporters want

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
What do the millions of Trump supporters want from their new president? The BBC's Rajini Vaidyanathan catches up with some of the voters she met while travelling across America during the election campaign.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Sarah Jo Reynolds, 25, Arkansas
Sarah Jo works for the Republican Party of Arkansas and I met her at her office in Little Rock a few days before the second presidential debate in October.
While other Republican women in the state had voiced concerns over Donald Trump's threat to bring up Bill Clinton's past as an election issue, Sarah Jo was steadfastly behind her candidate.
She remains so today, and has travelled to Washington DC for the inauguration.
During the primaries she was the "odd one out" with her friends, who all supported Marco Rubio.
"I wasn't a bandwagon type of person. I wanted to support who I thought was best, and I guess I picked the right horse."
She wasn't upset about the comments Trump made on the Access Hollywood tape saying he would grab a woman "by the pussy".
"Everybody makes mistakes and I'd be mortified if something like that was caught on camera," she says.
For Sarah Jo, the appeal lies in his promise of change, and his background as a businessman. Her two priorities are tax reform and repealing and replacing Obamacare.
She's hopeful her candidate can heal divisions in the country.
"I am prayerful that he takes into account every single American citizen, not just those who voted for him. Change can't occur overnight but I think we are going to see great things with his first 100 days in office."
Will Estrada, 33, Virginia
Will Estrada is the definition of a Washington insider. He's a lawyer, a lobbyist and the chair of the Loudon County Republican Party.
When we met in August, some local congressional candidates in the Virginia district were refusing to endorse the party's nominee.
But Will's loyalty was never in doubt. Now, as an invited guest to the inauguration, he'll get to witness Trump being sworn in up close.
"I think Trump has a huge opportunity to restore America's respect on the world stage," he says. "Trump is a phenomenon who defies expectations. He's rewritten the rule book.  It's exciting to watch."
He has two "non-negotiables": the repeal of President Obama's healthcare reforms, and a conservative pick for the vacant Supreme Court seat.
"We'd seen the growth of government way larger than our founders had intended," Will says of Obamacare, adding that he's "fine" with Mr Trump's undefined plan to replace it.
Back in the summer Will was an ardent critic of Hillary Clinton and agreed with the calls of many Trump supporters to "lock her up". But he understands why the new president has backed away from his promise to appoint a special prosecutor to investigate Mrs Clinton.
"It would have created more divisiveness if a president went after Hillary Clinton. I'd like to move forward - the Clintons are a relic of the past."
Marco Gutierrez, 43, California
I met Marco Gutierrez at the Republican National Convention in Ohio last July, where he was holding a "Latinos for Trump" sign. A real estate investor in California's Discovery Bay, he became one of the faces of Donald Trump's minority outreach.
Many Hispanic voters were incensed by Mr Trump's plan to build a wall, but not Marco. He believes the barrier will stop the flow of drugs and illegal immigration across the border.
"My only reservation is the way the immigration force will work as far as protecting innocent families," he cautions.
His public support for Mr Trump has cost him some friends and clients, but his wife, a fourth-generation Mexican-American, supports him.
Marco was just 17 when he came to the United States from Mexico in 1991. His parents, who'd been working in the US fields for many summers, had been granted amnesty after Ronald Reagan's change in immigration policy.
"When I came here I had 75 cents in my pocket and a pair of jeans and a white T-shirt," Marco says. "That was the beginning of my new life in the United States"
Even though he benefitted from an amnesty, Marco now believes in tougher immigration laws.
"Trump's a firm believer in results and so far I see results. That he's willing to sit down and talk about the problems. I think by March we're going to be able to judge whether he's making a difference. We have to give him a chance."
Bill Hartmann, 59, Michigan
I met Bill Hartmann, a self-employed building repair man, as he delivered Trump yard signs in Detroit ahead of the Michigan primary back in March.
"He was the only candidate who said he wanted to make America great again. And that's what turned me on."
When he watched Clinton supporters in tears on election night, Bill says he had a flashback to the sadness he felt when Barack Obama won in 2008. "I could totally relate to that".
Bill won't be among the inauguration crowds in Washington DC, but will be watching on a big screen at a local hall, with other supporters.
"I think people have lost respect for America," Bill says, "especially with Barack Obama going and bowing to other leaders in the world. Donald Trump doesn't want to be part of the new world order, he wants America to be independent."
Bill believes Trump's business past, can help deliver a fresh approach to foreign policy.
"He's someone who would be a good negotiator in contracts and agreements with foreign nations, he always seems to be open to discussion regardless of who the individual is."
June Savage, 49, Florida
It was hard to miss June Savage when we met at a Trump rally in Miami, Florida. Dressed in a top hat, red boots and draped in an American flag, she was holding a Women for Trump placard.
The former Miss Miami finalist, a lifelong Republican who works as a real estate agent, backed Mr Trump because he's a political outsider.
"You can't ask an attorney to be POTUS anymore. You need people who have built things, who have hired and fired people and who can stand up to these billionaire heads of state."
She's met the new president and sees his direct approach as a strength. "He has a big mouth - we all know that. He says a lot of things that maybe people like or do not like."
Her one concern is Mr Trump's addiction to social media, but she says everyone has the same tendency these days.
And to June, one of the biggest assets of a Trump presidency, is his VP pick, Mike Pence, the former governor of Indiana.
"They always say behind a good man is a very good woman," she says. "Not to call Mike Pence a woman, but he's definitely the woman in this marriage.  So you have a very strong man, which is Pence, behind Trump."
Martha Lehner, 75, Texas
I met Martha, a retired teacher and volunteer for the Trump campaign in Texas, at a watch party for a Republican primary debate in Houston in February.
Originally from Argentina, Martha came to the US nearly 30 years ago, and believes his wall on the US-Mexico border is a good idea.
She hopes Trump keeps the promises he talked about during the campaign, including "draining the swamp", reducing illegal immigration and beefing up national security.
She does have some advice for her new president though: get a thicker skin.
"Right now I think he's jumping on every negative comment that people in the media make of him, and he should just ignore it."
Cathy De Grazia, 56, Massachusetts
Cathy jokes she may be the only Trump supporter in her town of 11,000 in Massachusetts. We met as she campaigned for Trump in the neighbouring state of New Hampshire in the weeks before the election.
Cathy says she's become more conservative with age, but remains socially liberal. She was fed up with politicians from both parties.
She hopes Mr Trump can unite the country, and blames President Obama for making things worse.
"I just don't remember having racial divides as badly in my lifetime as we have in the past administration," she says.
But it was Mr Trump's economic policies that sealed her vote. Her father was a manufacturer who owned a textile mill in upstate New York in the 1980s.
"I know what's happened with trade agreements with other countries who don't have the same human rights standards and can lower costs, and unfairly compete with American workers."
On the campaign trail she said she heard similar stories from disenfranchised voters.
"A lot of people felt all of these jobs are disappearing and the government wasn't listening to us, things are decidedly worse for a lot of people."
Security, healthcare and the military also rank as Cathy's key concerns for a Trump administration.
And even though she's concerned about climate change, she doesn't think "pie in the sky agreements" are the way forward.
Cathy believes more needs to be done in making US cars more fuel efficient.
"We need to get our house in order before we start dictating to the rest of the world."
