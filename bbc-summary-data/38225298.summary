Wales flanker Dan Lydiate can make a full recovery from the injury that has ended his season, says Ospreys defence coach Brad Davis.

Lydiate's ruptured knee ligaments suffered in Wales' win over South Africa mean he will also miss out on the chance to challenge for a place on the 2017 Lions tour to New Zealand.
"I have absolutely no doubt he'll get back to where he was," said Davis.
"So much of it comes down to the determination of the player."
The Australian defence coach, a product of rugby league, likens Lydiate's chances of returning to the full capacity of his fitness to the experiences of former South Africa and Bath fly-half Butch James.
Davis coached James at Bath before the player returned to South Africa, for whom he made his final Test appearance against Wales at the 2011 World Cup.
"I worked with Butch James at Bath for three years and I think he'd had four knee reconstructions," Davis said.
"Each time he was able to come back, still represent South Africa and still play fantastic rugby for Bath and in South Africa.
"Most rugby players are competitive beasts. Most international players have got there because they are determined and love playing the game.
"Dan is going to be no different. He's going to apply himself to his rehab as he would to a training field.
"We have excellent medical staff here who will support him. I'm 100% sure he's going to come back good, fit and firing."
Davis said Lydiate was "getting back to some of his top form" when he was injured.
"We are going to give the best support and the best treatment and try to get him back on the park as quickly as possible," he said.
"Saying that, we have a pretty decent back-row roster that we can pick from."
Ospreys travel to French Top 14 side Grenoble in the European Challenge Cup third round on Thursday looking for a third successive win in the competition.
Davis said he was unaware of Wales hooker Scott Baldwin's progress amid Head Injury Assessment protocols after a blow he suffered in their win over Edinburgh last Friday.
