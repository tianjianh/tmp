The former Manchester United trainee netted the winner two minutes from time after earlier strikes in either half.
Tom Aldred had headed Blackpool into an early lead before Ajose levelled for the hosts 15 minutes later.
Ajose's close-range second gave them the lead on the hour, but Danny Philliskirk levelled from the spot after Clark Robertson was fouled.
