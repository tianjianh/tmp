General Election 2015: No Nottinghamshire seats change hands

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
None of Nottinghamshire's 11 parliamentary seats has changed hands in the 2015 General Election.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Labour's Gloria De Piero improved her 192 majority in Ashfield to 8,820.
Anna Soubry and Mark Spencer both increased their Conservative majorities to more than 4,000, in Broxtowe and Sherwood respectively.
The Tories kept hold of Newark and Rushcliffe, with Labour retaining Mansfield, Gedling, Bassetlaw and Nottingham South, East and North.
In the council elections, Labour held Bassetlaw, Nottingham, Gedling and Ashfield.
Mansfield followed its own tradition in electing another independent, Kate Allsop, as mayor.
However, there will be a recount on Monday in Broxtowe after two ballot boxes with uncounted votes were discovered at a polling station after the Eastwood Hilltop result was declared.
The result for Kimberley will also not be announced until Monday after a series of recounts were requested after a very tight finish for the third of three seats.
