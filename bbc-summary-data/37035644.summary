Madness concert: Shooting suspect's bail conditions changed for Belsonic gig

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man facing charges over a gun attack, in which the victim was shot several times, has had his bail conditions changed so he can go to a pop concert.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Patrick Joseph O'Neill is due to stand trial later this year over the shooting in Ardoyne, north Belfast, in November 2010. He denies the charges.
On Tuesday, he applied for a relaxation in his bail conditions so he could attend a Madness concert on 20 August.
A Belfast Crown Court judge agreed to extend his curfew for one night only.
The ruling means Mr O'Neill, of no fixed address, will be able to stay out until midnight on 20 August to attend the gig, which is part of the Belsonic music festival in Belfast.
Making the application, Mr O'Neill's defence barrister said his client had obeyed all of the conditions imposed on him since he was released on bail, including observing a curfew from 20:00 BST to 06:00 BST.
Mr O'Neill, 41, denies charges including wounding with intent, and possession of a Glock pistol with intent.
