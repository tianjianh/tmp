[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Fulham rescued a dramatic late draw at Molineux just when Wolves looked to have snatched a last-minute victory.

Dave Edwards appeared to have won the game with a strike from a tight angle in the 90th minute, but Floyd Ayite headed in four minutes into added time.
Kortney Hause had headed Wolves ahead but Fulham responded with strikes from Stefan Johansen, Ayite and Tom Cairney.
Two goals in nine minutes from Matt Doherty and Ivan Cavaleiro brought Wolves level before a last-gasp finale.
Following on from new boss Paul Lambert's first victory since he took charge, at QPR nine days before, Wolves made a good start when Hause headed home Helder Costa's far-post corner on 22 minutes.
But Stefan Johansen levelled from inside the Wolves box 10 minutes later, with a first-time right-foot shot into the top-left corner.
Fulham then struck twice more in the space of three minutes, Ayite climbing at the far post to head back across goal, before Cairney's superb volley into the top corner from the edge of the box.
Nouha Dicko touched on Conor Coady's cross on 65 minutes for Doherty to give Wolves hope before Cavaleiro burst into the box nine minutes later to equalise.
Wales international Edwards then thought he had won it when he shot into the roof of the net from a narrow angle at the far post.
But Fulham had the final word, as Ayite struck from inside the six-yard box, squeezing his second goal of the game past debutant home keeper Harry Burgoyne, who was deputising for the injured Carl Ikeme and Andy Lonergan.
Wolves, who climb back up a place to 19th, ended their run of four consecutive home league defeats, while Fulham, who have lost just once in six games, are up to 9th.
Wolves head coach Paul Lambert:
"It's not often you will see those types of games. It was exciting and I'm proud of the way we came back. We've got to be stronger defensively but we look a threat going forward.
"It's heart-attack material. But that's why you play the game and that's why I have got back into it.
"The crowd here are a major factor. They were unbelievable for us. They were great. If we turn in performances like that week in, week out, this will be a great place.
"We were up against a really good side but, in the second half, we were outstanding. We need a little bit of help in January, there's no two ways about it - a bit of know-how - but we have a young, talented team."
Fulham manager Slavisa Jokanovic:
"I am not thinking about going up or staying in the league. I am thinking how we are going to fix our problems.
"We led 3-1 and then we were losing. We controlled many things and we can score some goals, but we can be more clinical.
"We didn't kill the game and we suffered for that. We didn't manage our situation very well especially in the last half an hour.
"Wolves, with very simple football, created so many problems and, in this situation, we have to be more solid. We have to improve and not show our weaknesses."
