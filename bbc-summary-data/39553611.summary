[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Loch Lomond and Trossachs National Park has launched a public consultation on its priorities for the next five years.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The draft National Park Partnership Plan 2018-2023 aims to widen the park's "social, environmental, cultural and economic benefits".
The 12-week public consultation on the draft plan will run until 3 July.
The plan's three priorities cover conservation and land management, visitor experience and rural development.
This includes attracting and retaining more skilled working age and young people and encouraging people of all abilities and backgrounds to enjoy the outdoors.
The park's new convener, James Stuart, said: "The national park is a truly special place and this plan proposes how we along with a wide range of other organisations, can work together over the next five years to look after, enhance and make the most of it.
"By working collaboratively with all of our partners we can achieve a much greater impact."
Chief executive Gordon Watson said work was already underway in the park to provide young people with opportunities to gain skills and experience to support future employment.
He said: "We want to build on that by working closely with our partners to broaden that range of opportunities, whether it's through training, volunteering, modern apprenticeships and employment so that young people growing up in the national park aren't missing out on the opportunities that those living in more urban areas have access to.
"We are confident that this along with measures to address the lack of affordable housing options and efforts to protect and enhance local services and infrastructure, will ensure a bright future for young people living and working within the national park."
