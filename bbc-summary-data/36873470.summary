Dartmouth bids to give the Queen a landmark victory on Saturday in the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes at Ascot.

Her colt, trained by Sir Michael Stoute, could go off favourite as she seeks her first win for 62 years in the race named after her parents.
Olivier Peslier takes the ride on Dartmouth, who won the Hardwicke Stakes at Royal Ascot last month.
Rivals include Highland Reel, who was a narrow runner-up in that race.
The Queen's last winner in the Group One contest, a mid-season highlight of the British Flat racing season, came with Aureole in 1954.
"It's a huge showpiece at Ascot and a real highlight of the sporting calendar," the Queen's racing manager John Warren told BBC Radio Four.
"The Queen will be fascinated to see how this young, improving horse is going to develop going into Group One company. It's hugely exciting."
Dartmouth's chances have increased during the week following the withdrawal of both 2015 winner Postponed and second favourite Hawkbill.
The Queen is not expected to be back at the Berkshire track on Saturday due to another commitment in Scotland.
Stoute is seeking a record sixth victory in the mile-and-a-half contest with Dartmouth,  who was added to the £1.15m race as a late entry on Monday at a cost of £75,000.
As well as Highland Reel, Irish trainer Aidan O'Brien also runs Sir Isaac Newton.
Dante Stakes winner Wings Of Desire leads the other contenders, with Erupt, Second Step and Western Hymn completing the field.
