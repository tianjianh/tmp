A further 19 motorists were charged with offences including drink driving, using a mobile phone, and driving with no insurance or MOT.
The checks were carried out on the A9, M9, M876 and A876 on Sunday.
Police Scotland said three vehicles were seized by officers for various motoring offences.
A woman was also arrested for a warrant offence after her vehicle was stopped.
Road policing area commander Ch Insp Stevie Innes said: "Speeding and drink driving were the most serious crimes detected and I want to reiterate our message to motorists that should you be caught driving at excessive speeds or while under the influence, you will be charged and face the loss of your licence."
