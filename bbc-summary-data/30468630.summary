The murder inquiry was launched on Friday after officers were called to The Blossoms public house in Holyhead.
The 46-year-old victim died at the scene, despite the efforts of emergency services.
A 24-year-old local man was arrested on the roof of another nearby pub after several hours of negotiation.
The incident led to parts of the Anglesey town being closed to traffic, and residents told to stay in their homes and businesses.
Officers confirmed that they had been granted another 36 hours on Saturday evening to question a man on suspicion of murder, following an assault at The Blossoms pub.
"North Wales Police can confirm that no other persons are being sought in connection with the investigation," added a statement.
Floral tributes to the victim continue to be laid near the pub at Rhos y Gaer Terrace in the town.
The landlord of a neighbouring pub, the Dublin Packet, paid tribute to him, describing him as a "lovely man".
"The best man you'd ever meet in the world," said Owen Maguire.
"I've only known him four weeks, five weeks of being here but in that time he has made me welcome, I can guarantee that.
"My heart goes out to them - the family is a gorgeous family."
Police have yet to name the dead man, but said his family was being supported by a liaison officer as inquiries continue in the area.
They have also renewed an appeal for any witnesses near the pub on Friday afternoon to contact them on 101.
