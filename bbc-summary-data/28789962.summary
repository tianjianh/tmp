Police said Angel Hudson, 26, and her son Arthur Hudson-Cardy, were discovered at a house on Princess Way in Euxton on Wednesday evening.
The case is being treated as a murder inquiry but police said they were not looking for anyone else.
Ms Hudson and her son went missing from their home in Devon in 2013.
Post-mortem examinations are due to take place on the pair, officers said.
Lancashire Police said relatives of Ms Hudson, known locally as Katie, had been informed.
Det Supt Eddie Thistlethwaite said: "This is a tragic case.
"It is being treated as a murder inquiry although we are not looking for anybody else in connection with this incident.
"We are still in the very early stages of this investigation but we are conducting a number of inquiries in order to establish the exact circumstances surrounding the deaths."
Devon and Cornwall Police said in November last year that the mother and son had not been seen at their home in Teignmouth for several months.
They appealed for anyone who knew their whereabouts to contact them.
