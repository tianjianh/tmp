Nigeria forward Victor Moses may now be given a chance to play at Chelsea after returning from his loan deal at Stoke, says Potters manager Mark Hughes.

Moses, 24, has not played a competitive game for Chelsea since Jose Mourinho returned as coach two years ago.
"It could be he plays a part for Chelsea this year," said Hughes, who failed in a bid to keep the player.
"He showed enough in his time with us that it made Chelsea very aware of the talent they have."
Moses scored four goals in 23 appearances while on loan at Stoke last season and there were suggestions he could be part of a deal to take Asmir Begovic to Stamford Bridge.
However, the Bosnian goalkeeper joined the Blues this week with Dutch midfielder Marco van Ginkel going to Stoke on loan, while the future of Moses was left unclear.
According to Hughes, that could be because Moses has been given another opportunity to shine at the club that he joined three seasons ago from Wigan.
"I think they would possibly like to keep him although if they go into the market again, they could change that idea," he said.
"Victor obviously came to us last year and did exceptionally well for us."
