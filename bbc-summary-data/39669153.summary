2017 British & Irish Lions: Scot Tommy Seymour in 'disbelief' at his selection

Scotland wing Tommy Seymour says his journey from Ulster reject to British and Irish Lion is "beyond belief".

The Glasgow Warriors player was one of just two Scots selected by Warren Gatland for this summer's Lions tour of New Zealand, alongside club-mate and full-back Stuart Hogg.
"I don't think many people could have written this kind of path for me," said 28-year-old Seymour.
"I would never have expected this in a million years."
Seymour has flourished at Glasgow since joining in 2011 after failing to make his mark at Ulster where he says he was deemed "surplus to requirements".
He has developed into a top-class winger at Scotstoun, but says the thought of pulling on the Lions jersey was not even on his radar when he first arrived at the club.
"I don't think anyone at that age, moving clubs that young, would dare to think along those lines," he said.
"I can never have enough thanks towards Glasgow and the SRU for giving me the chance to carry on playing. When you have to leave a club at that age, somewhat surplus to requirements, you can definitely have doubts in your head - and to have doubts at a young age isn't great.
"It's an amazing feeling. Four years ago I was hopeful that Sean Maitland would be picked (for the 2013 Lions tour), as he rightly was, so there would be a wing spot free for the Scotland tour, which I ended up getting my first cap on. It's amazing to look back on."
Some prominent Scottish rugby figures have expressed dismay at just two Scots making the Lions squad despite Six Nations victories over Ireland and Wales, who by comparison had a combined 23 players selected.
Seymour admits that he would have loved to have seen more of his Scotland team-mates make the plane to New Zealand, but the competition for places from the four home nations made Gatland's selection process particularly tough.
"I will never be in the position of having to go through the difficulty of selecting a squad for something of this magnitude and I wouldn't dare try and put myself in the head-space of someone that would," Seymour added.
"As a Scotland team we had a great Six Nations, in my opinion, and a lot of guys put their hand up for selection, as did a lot of players from the other countries. It's an incredibly difficult job to pick a squad like this.
"Would I have loved it on a personal note to have more guys? Of course I would. It's such a hot question for a player to answer because I'm over the moon and forever thankful my name was read out. I'm not really going to get involved in the broader selection."
