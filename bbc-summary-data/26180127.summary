Paul Lambert, 34, who was originally from Courtney Hill, Newry,  was struck by a car early on Wednesday. A man has been arrested.
His cousin Kevin Bell, 26, was killed in a suspected hit and run crash in New York last June.
A fund was set up to help the Bell family pay the costs of bringing his body home.
Kevin Bell's father Colin said both his son and his nephew were killed by speeding cars that did not stop.
"It's not real yet and probably won't be until we get Paul's body home on Monday," Mr Bell said.
"It's just a recurring nightmare.
"We are a strong family and we have our faith and we have great people in Newry around us."
He said that after Kevin's death a fund set up to help arrange his repatriation raised Â£150,000 and it is being used to help other bereaved families who need to bring their loved ones home.
Mr Bell said Paul Lambert would be the 15th person they have helped to bring home.
Both Paul and Kevin were former students at Abbey Grammar School in Newry.
Its principal, Dermot McGovern, said there was "real shock and almost total disbelief" after Mr Lambert's death.
"That a family would have to face this a second time, disbelief is the word," he said.
Mr McGovern said Paul had recently taken part in an online talk to pupils to stress the advantages of learning a foreign language.
"I'd like to pass on my condolences to Paul's entire family circle and assure them that they'll remain in our prayers," he said.
