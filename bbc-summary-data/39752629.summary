A leading squash coach at a national centre in Manchester has been jailed for 14 years for abusing 10 boys.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Hirusha Henricus, of Ashton-under-Lyne raped one boy and and got others to strip naked over the internet after a series of "dares".
The 25-year-old worked at the National Squash Centre on the Etihad Campus, which is also home to Manchester City.
He admitted three counts of rape, one of attempted rape and six of causing a child to engage in sexual activity.
He also pleaded guilty to four counts of inciting a child to engage in sexual activity.
The part-time coach also admitted one count of inciting a child to watch a sexual act and one count of possession of an indecent photograph of a child.
Henricus, who was chairman of the City of Manchester Squash Club at the time, befriended some of his underage victims through social media.
The court heard he persuaded the boys to perform sex acts over webcam.
He had used fake female aliases to hide his identity and persuade the boys to send more revealing photos to him.
One boy was later sexually abused after they met up.
But in September 2014 police arrested Henricus, of Furness Avenue, after he had messaged another boy.
They seized his computer and phone which revealed hundreds of conversations with victims.
Det Insp Lewis Hughes of Greater Manchester Police said: "Henricus abused his position to prey on vulnerable teenagers to fulfil his own perverse sexual desires.
"His depravity knew no bounds, creating aliases to take advantage of and manipulate innocent children into giving him what he wanted."
