Mark Gatiss has said cult comedy League of Gentlemen may return after more than a decade - with a Brexit theme.

Gatiss was a co-creator of the anarchic BBC Two show, which ended in 2002, alongside Reece Shearsmith and Steve Pemberton.
Speaking on BBC Radio 6 Music he said: "We've talked seriously about doing something, we're not quite sure what it is yet but we'd love to do something."
"I wonder if there is something Brexity in us that we can do," he added.
The League of Gentlemen ran for three series on BBC Two. A 2005 feature film called The League of Gentlemen's Apocalypse was also made.
The offbeat show originated as a stage show. Its surreal sketches were set in and around the fictional town of Royston Vasey and the local shop, owned by Edward and his wife Tubbs, would only serve local people.
Gatiss told 6 Music's Radcliffe and Maconie show that people still shout catchphrases from the series at him.
He also expressed surprise at finding the show had acquired a new young fanbase.
"It's very reassuring, and slightly alarming, to realise that the 15-year-olds who ask you about it have come to it from YouTube. They are freshly minted fans," he said.
He also said the Brexit theme idea had come to him when thinking Britain had "become a local country for local people".
The League of Gentlemen earned Gatiss and his colleagues a Bafta Television Award, a Royal Television Society Award and the prestigious Golden Rose of Montreux.
Shearsmith and Pemberton reunited in 2009 to create a similarly dark BBC sitcom, Psychoville, which featured an episode guest-starring Gatiss.
Gatiss also plays Mycroft Holmes in BBC drama Sherlock, which he co-created, and he has written for, and appeared in, Doctor Who.
