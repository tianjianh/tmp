Officers from Gwent, South Wales, North Wales and Dyfed-Powys remembered the 10 people killed at the magazine along with two police officers.
Staff at BBC Wales, Media Wales and other newspapers including the Daily Post also held silences.
Meanwhile, a vigil has been organised in Cardiff Bay on Sunday.
The Honorary Consul of France in Cardiff, Marie Brousseau-Navarro, said about 300 people had already confirmed on Facebook that they would be attending the gathering in front of the Senedd at 18:00 GMT.
They will hold a minute's silence and bring candles, pens and pencils to show their commitment to freedom of speech.
France declared a day of national mourning on Thursday for the victims of the attack.
Eight journalists - including the magazine's editor - died along with a caretaker and a visitor when masked men armed with assault rifles stormed the Charlie Hebdo offices during an editorial meeting on Wednesday.
Eleven people were also wounded, some seriously.
Two policemen were killed on the street outside as the gunmen made their escape by car.
The Association of Chief Police Officers and the Police Federation wanted the tribute, saying UK officers "stand in solidarity".
North Wales Police Chief Constable Mark Polin led the remembrance gathering attended by over 100 people at the force headquarters in Old Colwyn.
"Our society is built on free speech, tolerance and moderation," he said.
"We must strive to ensure that the isolated acts of individuals do not destroy all that is good within our society."
The National Union of Journalists also called on its members to observe the minute's silence called by colleagues in France.
"The NUJ, together with journalists and their unions around the world, has condemned this attack as an attempt to gag press freedom and attack the entire profession," the union said in a statement.
Witnesses to the attack say the gunmen shouted "we have avenged the Prophet Muhammad" and "we killed Charlie Hebdo", as well as "God is Great" in Arabic.
