[SN]TITLE[SN]
Owners of Carloway Mill on Lewis plan to sell

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The owners of one of three Harris Tweed mills in Lewis plan to sell the business rather than going into voluntary administration.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Carloway Mill employs 27 people and provides yarn to 30 weavers.
The mill's owners said the cost of its raw material had increased by 35% and weavers' wages had risen but the price of tweed had fallen by 10%.
Last week, they said they could go into voluntary administration but have now proposed selling the mill.
