The prop - made from fibreglass and wood - is believed to have been used in the 1971 film Lust for a Vampire.
It went under the hammer at Moore Allen and Innocent in Cirencester.
Auctioneer Philip Allwood said it was quite a "statement piece" and had been sold to local buyer. Ahead of the sale he said he was hoping it would "appeal to the vampire market".
"But unfortunately the auction is during the day and they don't tend to come out in daylight," he added.
Mr Allwood said the prop had come from a private client who had bought it at an auction of film memorabilia in Tewkesbury in the early 1990s.
He said film buffs in the online community had helped to identify it as being from the 1971 film.
Hammer became known for its gothic horror films, from the mid-1950s to the 1970s, featuring iconic characters such as Frankenstein's monster, Dracula and the Mummy.
