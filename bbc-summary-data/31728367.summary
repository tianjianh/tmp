It's reported he had the idea at 2pm and after a whirl of speculation, and a few changes of venue, tickets went on sale for Koko in Camden at 7pm.
Crowds waited hours in the cold before Kanye eventually took to the stage about 1.20am.
He was joined by Skepta, JME, Novelist, Vic Mensa, Meridian Dan, Raekwon and Cyhi.
Radio 1's Clara Amfo was there and said: "It was ridiculous, there were hordes of people outside, it was crazy."
Fans were let inside the venue at around 12.45am and before Kanye eventually started more than half an hour later.
Grimmy was upset he was not able to make it - he had to "get up and do the radio [Radio1 breakfast show]".
He did say he was a fan of how spontaneous it was though, adding: "I love that it was like, panic, it's exciting it's tonight."
Clara told Grimmy that Kanye "smashed it".
"He's like trolling the UK right now and I totally fell for it."
In addition to playing some classics like Jesus Walks and Clique, he also previewed his new track with Vic Mensa.
1Xtra's Mistajam was also there, writing on Twitter: "Tonight will go down in history."
