Fell, 22, who had surgery in October for testicular cancer and missed the start of this season after chemotherapy, scored an unbeaten 116.
Steven Croft top-scored with 78 as Lancashire registered 267-7 to drop to the bottom of the South group.
Worcestershire's victory keeps their quarter-final hopes alive.
They will need to overcome Nottinghamshire at Trent Bridge on Monday to stand a chance of sealing a spot in the last eight of the competition.
Kyle Abbott led the way with the ball for Worcestershire in the must-win game, claiming the wickets of openers Tom Smith and Alviro Petersen on the way to figures of 3-56.
Lancashire's Luke Procter (47) shared a 99-run fifth-wicket stand with Croft on a day in which each of the top six batsmen reached double figures, although only Croft managed to notch a half-century.
While Worcestershire captain Daryl Mitchell lasted just three overs and five runs at the start of the hosts' response, his wicket saw Fell join the chase.
He brought up his maiden limited-overs century from 104 balls in a knock that included 15 fours.
