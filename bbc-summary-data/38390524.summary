Homelessness: Welsh councils given extra £6m from budget

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Another £6m to tackle homelessness is being given to local councils in Wales.

Communities Secretary Carl Sargeant said it would help them build on the "very positive start" they had made on new rules which oblige local authorities to prevent homelessness.
The Welsh Government budget sees total funding for day-to-day council spending in 2017/18 rise by £10m to £4.1bn.
Finance Secretary Mark Drakeford said it was a "good settlement" for councils to plan for harder choices ahead.
As promised in October's draft settlement, no council will see its cash funding fall by more than 0.5%, and many authorities will see their first cash increase for three years.
However, the effects of inflation will result in a real terms cut.
The Welsh Local Government Association said it welcomed the fact that some of the "additional pressures" it had identified were "beginning to be addressed", such as an extra £10m for social care.
However, deputy finance spokesman Anthony Hunt said: "The announcement today will still mean that cuts to local public services will continue as we shoulder the heaviest burden under austerity."
