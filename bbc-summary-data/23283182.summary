Attendance at this year's Great Yorkshire Show came close to the highest on record - a year after the event was cancelled due to heavy rain.

Soaring temperatures this week helped the three-day show in Harrogate attract 134,837 visitors - just 274 short of the record 135,111 set in 2006.
Last year's event was cancelled after one day, costing organisers about ??2m.
Show director Bill Cowling said: "I am absolutely delighted with our visitor numbers this year."
Mr Cowling said the success of the show was "a welcome boost" after what had been a difficult year in the aftermath of last year's cancellation - the first in its 155-year history.
The Yorkshire Agricultural Society, which organises the show, commissioned research earlier this year which showed that it generates about ??15m for the local economy each year.
