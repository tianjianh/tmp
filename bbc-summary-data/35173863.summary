The local government in the Indian capital has announced major restrictions on private cars to curb "alarming levels" of pollution.

Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal said on Thursday that private cars with even and odd numbers plates would be allowed on alternate days from 1 January.
Emergency vehicles like ambulances, police cars, fire engines and taxis have been exempted from the order.
Delhi has been experiencing hazardous levels of pollution in recent weeks.
The city witnessed its most polluted day of the year on Wednesday, according to a government agency monitoring air quality.
The levels of PM 2.5 particulate, which are very hazardous to health, rose to 295 micrograms.  Local laws recommend a maximum of 60 micrograms per cubic metre.
Mr Kejriwal requested the city residents to "help him in curbing pollution in Delhi".
"We cannot do it alone, it's everybody's responsibility," he said.
Mr Kejriwal promised that his government would implement this plan only for two weeks, and a review would be held before it is extended.
Critics, however, say the decision is not practical - they say that in a city with an inadequate public transport system and poor last-mile connectivity, the new measures are likely to inconvenience commuters.
But the chief minister said his government has taken measures, like running extra buses. The government has launched an app that people can use to book tuk-tuks to improve last-mile connectivity from the metro stations.
The government has also made several exemptions to make it easier for people to follow the restrictions.  The plan will be imposed between 8am to 8pm from Monday to Saturday.
Women will be allowed to drive their cars on all days but they can only be accompanied by women, and children below the age of 12. Cars carrying disabled people will also be allowed on all days.
Two-wheelers have also been exempted.  In cases of medical emergency, people will not be stopped from taking patients to hospitals.
Environmental activists have welcomed the decision, saying the situation is so grim that urgent drastic steps are needed.
New car sales are soaring in India, with 1,400 extra cars taking to the capital's streets every day.
