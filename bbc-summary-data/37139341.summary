James Coppinger also netted for Darren Ferguson's side while Ryan Hedges scored for the Glovers, who saw Bevis Mugabi sent off for a second bookable offence.
Rovers started in red-hot fashion and took the lead after just 34 seconds.
Williams lashed home a fine volley on the angle after meeting John Marquis' knock back from a corner.
But Yeovil were much the better side in the first half without truly testing Rovers goalkeeper Marko Marosi.
They were made to pay when Rovers doubled their advantage in the 54th minute, Coppinger volleying in from 15 yards.
Yeovil hit back two minutes later as Hedges intercepted Matty Blair's careless backwards header and fired past Marosi.
The afternoon got a little easier for the hosts when Mugabi saw red in the 76th minute following his second booking for dragging down the breaking Williams.
And there was no stopping the Rovers striker who calmly slotted home from close range eight minutes from time before heading home Tommy Rowe's cross unmarked in injury time.
