The pair, both 20, have agreed short-term deals until the end of the season with the League Two club.
Ward had loan spells at Torquay and Kidderminster during his time with West Brom, who released him in January.
Hooper made two first-team appearances for Rochdale last season, the most recent in December 2015.
Both players were named on the Carlisle bench for Tuesday's home game against play-off rivals Luton Town.
