The schoolboy was arrested on Tuesday under the Computer Misuse Act, which covers hacking and unauthorised access to computer material.
The Daily Record newspaper reported that he was questioned by Police Scotland as FBI agents watched on.
The boy has since been released and has been reported to the procurator fiscal.
A Police Scotland spokeswoman said: "Following a search of a property in the Glasgow area on Tuesday 16 February, a 15-year-old male was arrested in connection with alleged offences under the Computer Misuse Act 1990.
"He has since been released and is the subject of a report to the procurator fiscal."
