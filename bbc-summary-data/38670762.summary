Gloucester forward Gareth Evans has signed a new two-year contract with the Premiership club.

The 25-year-old back row has played six games this season after injury problems and scored a try in December's 28-24 loss to Harlequins at Twickenham.
"I haven't been able to give as much on the field as I'd have liked in the last season and a bit," Evans said.
Meanwhile, Scotland Under-20 scrum-half Ben Vellacott has signed his first professional deal with the club.
Vellacott, aged 21, is a product of the Cherry and Whites' academy, like Evans - who joined the first-team squad in 2013.
Evans told BBC Radio Gloucestershire: "For the club to say they still see me as part of the squad is a big vote of confidence from them.
"In the back of your mind when it's contract year, and you're not quite sure what's happening before negotiations start - it plays on your mind a bit.
"To have it all sorted is great. It gives you peace of mind and gives you to focus and knuckle down to some hard work."
