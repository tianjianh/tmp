The new iPad app from 360 Cities turns your mobile device into a window on the world. The app uses the gyroscope to spin your viewpoint around some of the most stunning landscapes on the planet.
If you wake up in the morning and immediately reach for your smartphone to check what is happening in the world, then news360.com could be for you. It can connect to all your main social accounts and analyses what you like so it can feed the latest stories straight into your dedicated timeline.
The Ed.Ted.com website lets you turn any video from YouTube into a complete lesson, adding context, objectives, questions, extended notes and resources links or discussion topics to really engage students in the lesson being delivered by the video clip.
Blackberry Messenger, or BBM - which at its height claimed over 75 million active users - has been released for iOS and Android. The free instant messenger app is in such demand that you will have to put your name in a queue for activation after downloading it.
Watch more clips on the Click website. If you are in the UK you can watch the whole programme on BBC iPlayer.
