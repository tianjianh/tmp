It told the BBC a number of volunteers had offered their services to mark one of the most important days in the Christian calendar.
The Minster Chapter dismissed its 30-strong team of bell-ringers in October, due to "safeguarding issues".
It is currently recruiting for a new paid head of Bell Tower to recruit and train a new team of volunteers.

Members of the dismissed team will be able to apply to join a new team, the cathedral authorities have said.
