[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A firm planning to make Middlesbrough's Riverside Stadium self-sufficient in energy is taking legal action against Durham Tees Valley Airport.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Renewable energy developer Empowering Wind Group, was granted planning permission in 2008 to build a 136m-tall turbine at the ground.
But the airport blocked the development after claiming there was an issue with "air safety".
The company said it was now pursuing litigation against the airport.
Middlesbrough Council approved planning permission for the turbine in 2008.
Following the decision, Durham Tees Valley Airport claimed there was an issue with "air safety" and "degradation to the radar service".
However, after an investigation by the Civil Aviation Authority, it was deemed Empowering Wind Group did not need approval from the airport and said the turbine would not compromise passenger safety.
Chief executive Paul Millinder said the company was taking legal action after it lost 30% of the tariff the company was going to get for the electricity it generated.
A statement from Durham Tees Valley Airport said: "We are awaiting a letter from Middlesbrough Council, which will explain the rationale behind this decision.
"We have no further comment to make at this stage."
The Championship club said the turbine would provide power for 20 years.
The stadium will be the first sports venue in Europe to become self-sustainable.
The turbine, which will be installed in the car park, is expected to be built by the end of May.
