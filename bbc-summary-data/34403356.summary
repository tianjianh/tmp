Northern Ireland MLAs discuss songs to sing on Dublin bus trip

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Members of the assembly's finance committee have been discussing suitable songs to sing on a bus trip to Dublin.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The committee's clerk asked whether members required the use of a mini-bus to get to a meeting with the Irish parliament's Public Accounts Committee.
Sinn Féin's Máirtín Ó Muilleoir said he would prefer to catch the train.
Ulster Unionist Leslie Cree thought the members should travel together in a bus to save money.
Warming to the idea, Mr Ó Muilleoir asked if Mr Cree knew "any good songs" to sing on the bus.
The DUP's Jim Wells suggested they sing "the Sash".
