Jason Buchan, 35, and David Stead, 47, have been missing since their boat capsized close to the village of East Wemyss in Fife on 10 August.
A third man, Birrell Stewart, 30, was dead when he was picked up from the sea. A formal identification of the body is still to take place.
Another body was found on the shoreline at West Wemyss in Fife on Wednesday.
A spokesman for Police Scotland said: "Police in Fife were called to West Wemyss on Wednesday where a man's body was recovered from the shoreline.
"Officers were alerted at around 13:00 by a member of the public who made the discovery.
"A formal identification will now be carried out and family liaison officers have informed the relatives of the two men who were reported missing following the fishing boat tragedy, which occurred off East Wemyss on Monday, 10 August."
The discovery follows human remains found on the West Sands in St Andrews a week after the boat capsized.
