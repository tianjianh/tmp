Autism and Asperger provision in Wales 'patchy', charity says

Service provision for the 34,000 people with autism and Asperger syndrome in Wales is "patchy", a charity has said.

The National Autistic Society Cymru told the Newyddion 9 programme the Welsh government had lost momentum since unveiling its 2008 autism strategy.
It said 63% of those recently surveyed waited too long to be diagnosed.
The Welsh government said it had a "clear commitment" to helping those affected.
The society argued Wales needed its own Autism Act, similar to those in England and Northern Ireland, and called for all Welsh political parties to commit to one before May's assembly elections.
Meleri Thomas, of the society, said: "What we're finding is that autism provision is patchy across the country, so we think that, by having an Autism Act, you would then be able to have more continuity."
She pointed out the Welsh government was the first in the UK to have an autism strategy but legislation was now needed.
More than half of those questioned as part of a recent survey by the charity said getting a diagnosis in Wales was stressful.
One in five parents said they were happy with the education and support their children received, but 44% said services had worsened over the past five years.
Nath Trevett, 29, of Mountain Ash, Rhondda Cynon Taff, has Asperger syndrome and has been unemployed for almost a year.
He said more needed to be done to protect the rights of people affected by autism and to help them get into employment.
Mr Trevett said he was not diagnosed until he was 16 and he had attended an unsuitable school like a "wild jungle", where he had been bullied and felt unsafe.
In May, Health Minister Mark Drakeford said £2m would be spent to cut waiting times for young people with autism and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).
An extra £600,000 was also set aside for tackling diagnosis delays for all ages, improving training and boosting education and job prospects.
A Welsh government spokesperson said: "We have a clear commitment to supporting people with Autistic Spectrum Disorder (ASD).
"We published our original ASD strategic action plan in 2008, which was the first of its kind in the UK.
"Later this week, we will launch our refreshed ASD Strategic Action Plan, which will set out what we will do in the weeks, months and years ahead to build on the support already in place to care for children, young people and adults with ASD throughout their lives."
