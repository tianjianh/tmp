Monaghan duo Darren Hughes and Conor McManus and Donegal's Paddy McBrearty are also included a strong squad.
The 23-man panel includes nine of this year's All-Star teams.
Footballer of the year Jack McCaffrey is joined by his Dublin team-mates Philly McMahon, Rory O'Carroll and Bernard Brogan, who captains the side.
The other 2015 All-Stars in the squad for the one-off Test at Croke Park on 23 November are Donnelly, McManus, Mayo pair Lee Keegan and Aidan O'Shea plus Kerry player Donnchadh Walsh.
Diarmuid Connolly is the fifth member of Dublin's All-Ireland winning side to be included while other notable inclusions are Clare's Gary Brennan, Tipperary's Ciaran McDonald and Longford's Michael Quinn.
In all, there are 12 counties from across all four provinces represented in the 23.
Ireland manager Joe Kernan has also named eight stand-by players including Monaghan pair Dessie Mone and Kieran Hughes plus Cavan duo Killian Clarke and Gearoid McKiernan.
Last year's captain Michael Murphy and Tyrone's Sean Cavanagh were both unavailable because of injury.
Kernan is confident that he has assembled a strong squad capable of competing with the Australians.
"We've been delighted with the response and the hard work put in by players from all over the country in the last eight weeks in a bid to represent Ireland," said the Ireland manager.
"Unfortunately injuries and club commitments have ruled some players out, but I am happy that we have still managed to assemble a very strong squad.
"It was a difficult job to reduce numbers down to the squad and the standby list."
Australia have already named a strong squad for the Test.
