Ms Knights' life was only saved after a neighbour heard a "commotion" and rushed to the house to intervene, Cambridgeshire Police said.
The neighbour found Sharpe on top of her, with Mr Hasler lying wounded nearby.
Police said the unnamed neighbour kicked the knife out of Sharpe's hand and attempted to restrain him, but Sharpe escaped.

In a statement released shortly after Mr Hasler's death. his family described him as a "much-loved son, brother, grandson, nephew and friend".
"Kind-hearted and living his life to the full, he came into the world early and has left us far too soon."
The neighbour who saved Ms Knights' life was awarded Â£1,000 by the High Sheriff.
