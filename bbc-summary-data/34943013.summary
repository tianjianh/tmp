Highland Council report says 'warm clothes' could cut heating bills

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Wearing warm clothing has been suggested as way council staff could help reduce the need to turn up heating where they work.

The idea is one of a number aimed at helping Highland Council to cut carbon emissions and save money in a report sent to councillors.
Officers said the local authority could "promote use of warm clothing rather than supplementary heating".
A council spokesperson said it was not suggesting turning heating off.
"There are legal minimum temperatures for working conditions," the spokesperson said.
"We are not suggesting we reduce heating below the legal minimum. However, we often heat our buildings by several degrees warmer than this.
"By reviewing our practices, we could save thousands of pounds and, in the light of the budget savings required, we cannot afford to ignore this potential saving."
Highland Council has been working for several years to reduce its carbon footprint by trying to use less electricity and fuel.
Other suggestions in the new report include switching off computers when they are not in use, turning lights off where they are not needed and changing to more energy efficient LED lighting.
