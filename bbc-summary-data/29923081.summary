Christine Sugarhood, from West Sussex, suffered a heart attack pulling her husband Norman from the sea at the resort of Paphos.
Police in Paphos said a second man, aged 61, who tried to save Mrs Sugarhood, 66, also died from a heart attack, after giving her first aid.
Friends who knew Mrs Sugarhood have been paying tribute to her.
Neighbour Pam Barber said Mr and Mrs Sugarhood had lived next door to her in Lindfield, near Haywards Heath, for more than a decade.
"They had family, grandchildren, and they were quite involved with them," she said.
"Her husband is older and I'm not sure how he's going to manage as I don't think he's very well."
Another neighbour, who did not want to be named, said: "It's an absolute tragedy. She was a delightful person."
Mr and Mrs Sugarhood were members of Lindfield Bowling Club.
Match secretary Mick O'Donnell said he believed the couple were in Paphos with some other members, but did not know whether they had travelled for a bowling event.
He said: "We were shocked to hear that Christine had passed away, and our thoughts are obviously with her husband and family.
"Christine was a popular and very active member in all aspects of the club and she will be greatly missed."
The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) confirmed two British nationals died on Tuesday in Cyprus.
An FCO spokesman said: "We are providing consular assistance at this difficult time."
The incident occurred in the Yeroskipou area of the tourist resort. Paphos has notoriously strong currents off its beaches.
