[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Met is being investigated after the remains of a woman who went missing in London were found in the grounds of a stately home in Edinburgh.

The body of Saima Ahmed, was discovered at Gogar Mount House in January, five months after she went missing.
Her family believe the 36-year-old, who was last seen at Wembley Central Station, may have been murdered.
The Met handled the initial part of the inquiry. Police Scotland is now investigating her death.
A Met spokesman said the force could not comment on an ongoing independent investigation.
Ms Ahmed, a divorced librarian who lived with her parents and brother, was last seen on 30 August boarding a train instead of going to work.
Detectives believe she took further trains to Edinburgh, perhaps via Hemel Hempstead and Birmingham, although her exact route is not known.
Her remains were found in Scotland on 9 January, hundreds of miles away from her home in Wembley.
Ms Ahmed's sister Saiqa, 37, said the Met failed to take the initial case seriously despite the disappearance being "totally out of character".
She told The Times officers classed the disappearance as being "low risk" as she never left home or spent a night out of the house.
"She wouldn't go anywhere without telling our parents," she said.
Her siblings said there is nothing to suggest she took her own life and they believe she could have met up with "the wrong person".
The Met Police Directorate of Professional Standards referred the force's handling of the inquiry to the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC).
An IPCC spokesman said the organisation would "look at the risk assessment applied, whether appropriate inquiries were made and how Saima's family were dealt with".
