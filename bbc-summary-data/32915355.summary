[SN]TITLE[SN]
Tilting structure suggested for River Ness in Inverness

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A structure that would tilt gently up and down as people walked on it has been put forward as an idea for public art on a Scottish river.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Gathering Place is one of six ideas for the River Ness where it flows through Inverness.
The public art project forms part of the River Ness Flood Alleviation Scheme, a multi-million pound effort to better protect the city from flooding.
Highland Council has invited the public to pick their favourite idea.
River Connections, another of the proposals, includes seating areas and poetry set into stones.
Sculptural Destination would see a new "iconic landmark"  installed on the riverside, which people could visit and also view from a distance.
Rest Spaces involves "relaxation areas" for individuals or small groups, while The Trail would encourage people to explore the riverside from the Ness Islands to the river's mouth using a paper map or an app.
Children's Riverside Feature is an idea to involve secondary school pupils in helping to create an interactive play space.
Highland Council, City of Inverness Common Good Fund, Creative Scotland and Highlands and Islands Enterprise are funding the arts project.
