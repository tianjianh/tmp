Ireland's top Olympic official Pat Hickey has been formally charged by a judge in Brazil.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Pat Hickey, along with Irishman Kevin Mallon, is one of 10 defendants facing a number of charges as part of an investigation into an alleged ticketing scam.
The judge ordered that the passports of Mr Hickey and Mr Mallon be retained.
It is expected that it could be up to a year and a half before a court case takes place.
Mr Hickey, was the most senior Olympic official in Ireland before his dramatic arrest in a Rio hotel room on 17 August.
He spent time in the maximum security Bangu 10 prison before being released and placed under house arrest on 30 August.
Under the ruling, Mr Hickey and Mr Mallon will be returned to jail if they breach any of the conditions imposed on them by the court in Rio de Janeiro.
Following his arrest, the Olympic Council of Ireland (OCI) said he had stood down temporarily from his roles.
Two other Irishmen are also facing charges or are being sought by police.
Kevin Mallon, a Dublin-based director of THG Sports, is also facing charges in relation to the alleged ticketing scam.
On Friday, police in Brazil said an arrest warrant was being sought for Martin Burke, the sports director of the Olympic Council of Ireland (OCI).
