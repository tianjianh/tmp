[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Tom Squires played for the Sheffield Steelers and represented Great Britain.
Appearing at Sheffield Crown Court, the 26-year-old, of Steven Crescent, Chapeltown, was jailed for five years and four months.
Squires will also spend three years on extended licence following his release from prison and has been barred form working with children.
He pleaded guilty to one count of sexual activity with a child and four counts of inciting sexual activity with a child.
The offences against five girls, all under 16, took place in the Sheffield area between 2011 and 2016.  Some of the offences took place during his time playing with Hull Stingrays, between 2012 and 2014.
Police said Squires approached his victims via social media and requested sexual images from them.
Det Sgt Aneela Khalil-Khan, said: "Squires was relatively well-known locally as an ice hockey player, as well as coaching the sport. He took advantage of this position of power to groom and sexually exploit his victims.
"He used his position as ice hockey coach to approach young girls, some of whom recognised him as a local hockey 'star', and began the grooming process."
