Olly Woodburn: Exeter winger hopes to prove Bath wrong

New Exeter winger Olly Woodburn hopes he can show former club Bath what they have missed out on by making a major impact with the Chiefs.

He spent his entire career at Bath, but played just 15 Premiership games in the last three seasons at the Rec.
"Everyone else was an international so it was very hard to get into the team and then stay in," he said.
"Here I feel it's an even playing field, if you play well, if you train well, then you'll get selected."
Last season was Woodburn's most productive for Bath, playing 20 times in all competitions and scoring five tries.
"For years I've gone out and tried to show them with my performances that I'm Premiership standard and I want to play week in, week out," the 23-year-old told BBC Sport.
"But I didn't get that there, so if I get some good performances here and am successful at Exeter I think I will take some pride looking back.
"It wouldn't be in a bitter way, I would just be like 'look this is me achieving my potential'. That's a massive goal of mine, playing the sport I love and achieving as much as I can and going as far as I can."
But with James Short joining Exeter in the summer from London Irish and England's Jack Nowell also in the squad, Woodburn knows getting into the team will not be easy.
"There's some incredible talent here, I want to learn from them as well and I think that's where you get the best rugby out of people, when you've got competition.
"I wasn't coming here with the mindset I'd walk into the team, I came here with a mindset that I'd have to work at it, stick at it and stay hungry."
