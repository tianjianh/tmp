Home keeper Artur Krysiak superbly denied George Francomb and Tom Elliott as the away side began brightly.
Omar Sowunmi's flick-on found Ryan Bird who fired in from close range to give the home side the lead.
The visitors continued to press and were rewarded 10 minutes from time when Akinfenwa headed home Francomb's corner to share the points.
AFC Wimbledon manager Neal Ardley told BBC London 94.9:

"Last week it was frustration with the man in the middle, today it's frustration because we were the better team and we should have won the game.
"I thought today we were exceptional - in general the chances we created I think we probably should have scored four today.
"I'm proud of the boys, the performance levels were exceptional and I'm really pleased for the fans because it would have been sad for everyone involved in the club to come home disappointed today after such a good performance."
