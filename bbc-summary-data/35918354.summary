Super League: St Helens 16-17 Hull FC

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Marc Sneyd's late drop-goal gave Hull FC a fourth straight Super League win at the expense of frustrated St Helens.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The hosts had led at half-time through Joe Greenwood, Matty Dawson and Jordan Turner tries, but failed to score after the break and the visitors capitalised.
Danny Houghton and Curtis Naughton crossed for Hull before the break and they levelled through Kirk Yeaman after 58 minutes.
And Sneyd's 40-metre kick inflicted a second straight home defeat on Saints.
St Helens's Theo Fages had missed a drop-goal attempt moments before Sneyd's dramatic winner at the other end.
The hosts, who were without injured winger Tommy Makinson following a potentially season-ending anterior cruciate ligament injury, now lie sixth in the table.
Defeat leaves them two points behind Hull, who are themselves now four points off top spot, in fourth.

Hull FC: Shaul; Michaels, Fonua, Yeaman, Naughton; Tuimavave, Sneyd; Taylor, Houghton, Watts, Minichiello, Manu, Ellis.
