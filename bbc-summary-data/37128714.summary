Kell Brook targets 'outrageous' win over Gennady Golovkin

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Kell Brook says he chose to fight Gennady Golovkin because he needed to do something "outrageous" to stand out from the crowd.

Brook, the IBF welterweight champion, will jump two weight divisions to fight undisputed world middleweight champion Golovkin in London on 10 September.
Sheffield's Brook, 30, is one of 14 current British world champions.
"Beating Golovkin would make me the best pound-for-pound boxer in the world," Brook told BBC Sport.
"When we only had one or two world champions, the reaction when you won a world title was: 'Yes, unbelievable for Britain.' But now it's more a case of: 'Oh, someone else has won a world title.'
"No-one is shocked any more. So you do have to do something outrageous to stand out.
"I've wanted to be the best since I was a little kid. Imagine me beating him and taking those belts to be the best pound-for-pound fighter in the world. It would be unbelievable."
Brook is unbeaten in 36 professional contests and has made three defences of the IBF welterweight belt he won from American Shawn Porter in 2014.
However, Brook was criticised for the quality of, or more correctly lack of, his recent opponents before signing to fight Kazakhstan knockout artist Golovkin.
The 34-year-old is unbeaten in 35 pro contests and has 32 early victories to his name, giving him a knockout percentage of 91%, the highest in the history of the world middleweight championship.
"There's a buzz in the air with this fight - it's a mega-fight," said Brook, who weighed 176lb at a check weight 30 days before the fight, 16lb over the middleweight limit and 11lb more than Golovkin.
"It isn't just a world champion fighting a world champion, it's the biggest fight you can make in world boxing.
"You've got two unbeaten fighters with a lot of knockouts between them going up against each other.
"It's ludicrous a guy is jumping up two divisions to face somebody no one will fight. It's got everything and that's why everyone needs to tune in."
Brook is bidding to succeed where domestic rival Amir Khan failed - Bolton's Khan jumped two weight divisions to fight then WBC champion Saul Alvarez in May and was knocked out in six rounds.
Golovkin, who owns the WBA, WBC and IBF titles, is one of the most avoided boxers in the world - Mexico's Alvarez chose to vacate his WBC title rather than fight him.
