[SN]TITLE[SN]
Southport P-P Boreham Wood

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Southport's National League game against Boreham Wood has been postponed because of a waterlogged pitch.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The game was called off following a 07:15 GMT pitch inspection on Saturday after overnight rain meant the ball was unable to bounce in numerous areas.
No new date has yet been set for the game to be played.
It means Southport's new signing, winger Jonny Giles, will have to wait for his debut after joining on loan from Oxford United.
