Gillen Fuels, in Londonderry, said the lorry was in a "fuel yard filled with kerosene, gas oil and bottled gas".
Police said the fire caused "substantial damage" to two vehicles in the yard on Heather Road.
The incident happened at about 22:30 BST on Friday night.
The company wrote on Facebook that it was "disgusting that people can enter our property and vandalise our lorries".
"The lorry was parked next to numerous oil lorries with kerosene on board and if that fire had not been contained in time our whole livelihood would have been up in flames, not to mention businesses on either side of us
"Someone could have been seriously hurt but thankfully no one was hurt and we would like to thank the fire service (who) acted so quickly.
"To those who entered our property and done this, CCTV will be checked on and police are on the matter."
