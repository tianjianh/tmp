[SN]TITLE[SN]
Nottingham Forest 1-1 Fulham

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Nicklas Bendtner scored his first Nottingham Forest goal but Fulham hit back for a deserved draw.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Bendtner, who struck the bar with a thunderous 25-yard strike before the break, volleyed the hosts ahead.
Fulham levelled when Tom Cairney slotted the ball in from close range after the Reds failed to clear.
The visitors, who like Forest are now winless in five games, pushed for a winner but wasted late chances in a game full of poor finishing.
Former Arsenal striker Bendtner, one of six changes from Saturday's last-minute defeat against Sheffield Wednesday, had two glorious opportunities to open the scoring.
His first effort came thudding back off the bar, but his second chance should have found the net. The Dane kept his shot low from Mustapha Carayol's pull-back but was far from convincing allowing keeper David Button to save with his feet.
In between, Fulham had an even better opportunity with Matt Smith's point-blank header somehow kept out by a breathtaking one-handed stop from Reds keeper Vladimir Stojkovic.
More missed chances followed after the interval, notably when the otherwise impressive Sone Aluko hooked the ball over the bar from two yards when it seemed impossible to miss.
But after Cairney side-footed in Scott Malone's cross, Fulham pressed for a winner and came close to finding it, Smith having a strike ruled out for offside and substitute Chris Martin forcing another fine save from Stojkovic.
Nottingham Forest head coach Philippe Montanier:
"It was a tough and physical game and it could easily have ended 3-3. There were plenty of opportunities for both teams and it was played at a high tempo. It was important for us to have a decent result after three defeats to end this bad period.
"I thought if we scored first then we would go on to win the game, then again if Fulham had got the first goal then they could have thoroughly protected the lead and won.
"I made six changes - Fulham made five - and some of the players were very tired while Henri Lansbury was suspended and so we needed to freshen it up. It will be good for us to have the international break to recuperate and have a good break, the players need it."
Fulham boss Slavisa Jokanovic:
"My team showed a reaction after the embarrassing game against Bristol City but I am disappointed we didn't score a second and win the game. We created enough chances to have won the game but if we stay calm then the goals will come.
"The whole team played well, we all worked together and created plenty of chances and there is improvement to come.
"We have to be confident on the ball and be organised. Our one big problem is at home, when we don't have the ball, but we did that very well. Our movement was very good. We have to follow this up now."
