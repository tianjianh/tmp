[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The parents of a three-year-old boy who was killed by a trailer that came loose in transit have called for trailers to be MOT tested.

Scott and Donna Hussey's son, Freddie, suffered fatal head injuries when he was hit as he walked with his mother.
Mr Hussey said if the trailer had been tested "this might not had happened".
Tony Davies, 37, from Hallen, was ordered to carry out 200 hours of community service for causing Freddie's death through careless driving.
He was also disqualified from driving for six months by a judge at Bristol Crown Court.
In court Freddie's parents called the sentence a "joke" and described Davies as "scum".
But judge Geoffrey Mercer said there was "no suggestion" that Davies was driving "anything but entirely properly".
"The carelessness lies between the coupling of the Land Rover and the trailer," he added.
Mr Hussey said the law needed to be changed and confirmed the couple would be appealing to the Attorney General's office because of the "leniency" of the sentence.
"There should be a MOT for trailers, there is in other countries and there should be here, if there were this might not have happened," he said.
Mrs Hussey said there had been a similar tragedy in Derbyshire eight years ago when a four-year-old boy was hit by a runaway trailer.
"His mother went to the government to try to get the law changed and introduce the safety checks but nothing ever happened.
"What happened to Freddie could have been prevented if they'd listened.
"Two little boy's lives have gone now, there could be more, we don't know.
"It doesn't seem right that in a country which is all on health and safety, yet these trailers are being driven around dangerously."
