The 26-year-old was released by York City after failing to score in 14 appearances last season.
However, he netted 26 times in 69 appearances in a two-season spell at Barnet between 2012 and 2014.
Hyde is the Boro's fourth signing of the summer, following left-back Andrew Fox and forwards Matt Godden and Rowan Liburd.
"I know this league inside out now and any team can go on a run, but it's who does it for the longest period that counts.
"It's about winning games and fingers crossed I can help Stevenage do that this season," he told the club website.
Details of his contract with Stevenage have not been disclosed.
