Team Sky doping controversy is 'outrageous,' says Owain Doull

Welsh cyclist Owain Doull says it is "outrageous" current Team Sky riders have been drawn into the controversy over a "mystery package" delivered to ex-rider Sir Bradley Wiggins.

UK Anti-Doping is investigating what delivered to Wiggins on the final day of the 2011 Criterium du Dauphine.
Doull, who joined Team Sky in August 2016, said the ongoing situation was frustrating.
"It's unfair for those guys who work so hard," said Doull.
His compatriot Geraint Thomas has spoken of his "annoyance" that Wiggins and the team's former doctor Richard Freeman have not fielded any "flak" over the issue.
Team Sky boss, Sir Dave Brailsford, has said he will not resign over the controversy and Doull himself insisted the furore was not affecting him and his teammates when it came to racing itself.
"I haven't been racing that much. Especially compared to some of the others," Cardiff-born Doull told BBC Wales Sport.
"I'm not really in the limelight so I don't see too much of it, but for these accusations to be thrown at them is outrageous.
"It doesn't really affect us at all, especially me, as someone's only joined the team this year. It's stuff that happened five years ago.
"For me and a lot of the guys it has no real impact at all. Everyone's cracking on as normal."
Next up for Doull and his teammates is the E3 Harelbeke cobbled classic.
The 23-year-old, who struck gold in the team pursuit at the 2016 Olympics, is just glad to be back in action after a spell out of the saddle.
His Team Sky and world tour debut in January in Australia was aborted after he underwent surgery for appendicitis.
On his return Doull suffered a nasty crash in Abu Dhabi, later expressing concerns after a brake disc apparently cut through his shoe.
Doull wants to focus on his racing after a start to his Team Sky career he acknowledges has been less than ideal.
"I'm pretty much fully back now," said Doull.
"It's almost two months since it (having his appendix out) happened.  It was surprising how much it took out of me and how drained I was for quite a long time afterwards.
"I thought I'd bounce back quicker than I did. In terms of general riding, all was good, but I was lacking the top-end stuff, especially when racing.
"I was (surprised by the reaction to his disc brake comments in Abu Dhabi) to be honest. It attracted a lot of attention, but I guess that's a good thing.
"It shows it was a big thing that people take seriously."
With Team Sky winning the Harelbake for the last two years, Doull is hoping he can play his part in making it a hat-trick.
"I think the team is going for the win again," added Doull.
"They usually perform well in this race, so we'll be looking to do the same.
"For me, it's like jumping back into the deep end. These are the races that, before my setbacks, I'd provisionally planned to target.
"It's nice just to be racing. We'll see where I'm at and then go from there."
