[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A centuries-old series of plays performed by amateur actors is set to return to York Minster for the first time in 16 years.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Mystery Plays were first performed in York in the 14th Century and traditionally involve just one professional actor.
The plays will return to the Minster in June 2016. More than 28,000 people attended its last productions in 2000.
The 800-year-old gothic cathedral will host a month-long staging of the plays.
The Very Reverend Vivienne Faull, Dean of York Minster, said: "After a gap of 16 years it is a great pleasure and enormously exciting to confirm the staging of this second, landmark production of the Mystery Plays at York Minster."
In 2014 the plays were staged on wagons travelling around the city's streets.
The plays are described as telling the story of the world from the beginning of all things to the end of all things.
The performances traditionally take place on the feast day of Corpus Christi, which can fall in either May or June.
Nicola Corp, who has worked on projects for the BBC and Capital Radio, has been appointed to produce the event.
