The 21-year-old has been with the Blues for a year, having previously had spells with Leicester City, Nottingham Forest and Doncaster Rover Belles.
The England Under-23 international comes in to replace Siobhan Chamberlain, who has joined Arsenal.
"I'm really excited to be here," Earps told BBC Sport.
"I'm looking for game time and after speaking to the manager [Dave Edmondson] and training here, the vibe was really positive. I'm excited to come down and fit into that."
Earps, who is also a business student at Loughborough University, has been capped through the England age groups and was recently named in Mark Sampson's senior squad for the World Cup qualifier against Montenegro on 5 April.
She is set to deputise for Chamberlain, who is currently England's first-choice keeper.
"There's some brilliant players in the squad with a lot of experience," added Earps.
"I hope to be like a sponge and absorb as much as I can from the players, coaches and the environment. I want to bring that back to my club and put it into my performances."
