Carrick Rangers have appointed former Portadown assistant boss Kieran Harding as their new manager.

Harding, who quit Shamrock Park along with manager Ronnie McFall in March, takes over from Gary Haveron following his resignation on Monday.
"I've a lot of respect and time for him and he wanted an opportunity in management," Rangers owner Michael Hughes told the Carrick Times.
"He's prepared to come and help develop the football club and our brand."
"Kieran is a guy who has been around Irish League football as a coach and he delivers the coaching licences for the IFA," added Hughes.
"For me it's a really positive appointment and I'm really looking forward to working with him and to the challenges ahead."
Harding and McFall stepped down at Portadown following a shock defeat by Lurgan Celtic in the Irish Cup.
Meanwhile, Carrick said Haveron departed as they were "unable to establish a mutual agreement on the best way forward for the club".
Rangers avoided relegation by finishing 10th but the club was later charged for failing to implement Haveron's touchline ban against Dungannnon.
It could have resulted in Carrick losing three points and being relegated but the Irish FA decided not to apply any sanction following a hearing.
Warrenpoint Town, who finished bottom but just a point behind Carrick, have appealed the IFA ruling.
