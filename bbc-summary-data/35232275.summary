Laura Davies, 21, was attacked near the Essex Horse and Pony Protection Society base in Basildon where she lived and worked.
Her ex-boyfriend, Jordan Taylor, 22, of Basildon, denies murder.
Chelmsford Crown Court was told the attack was so forceful that the knife used was left badly bent.
Prosecutor Peter Gair said: "We say her life was taken by this man during a sustained and brutal attack with a knife. She suffered 80 knife wounds to her body.
"That attack was as a direct result of her telling the defendant that their relationship was over.
"Whether it was motivated by jealousy or anger of a mixture of both and other emotions, he exacted a terrible revenge on her which caused her to die at the scene."
On the night of her death, Miss Davies had cooked a meal for them both at the flat they shared at the sanctuary, the jury heard.
Mr Gair added she had decided earlier that day to end the relationship but to let Mr Taylor continue to live at the flat as she did not want to make him homeless.
Police later found plates of uneaten food on the kitchen table, suggesting events had escalated quickly.
The prosecution told jurors that Taylor initially attacked her in the flat.
She fled outside in her pyjamas but he chased after her and killed her in an area known as the Wishing Well before dragging her body to some nearby bushes, Mr Gair added.
Pathologist Benjamin Swift said a post-mortem examination found she had suffered at least 80 stab wounds. There were also signs she had been struck all over her body.
"She suffered defensive wounds, suggesting she had been fighting for her life," Mr Gair said.
Witness Bruce Sequin arrived at the sanctuary to see a man holding a knife standing over a woman's body and making downward stabbing motions.
He raised the alarm and when police arrived they found Taylor covered in blood.
Officers rushed to help Miss Davies and she gasped 'help" before losing the strength to speak, Mr Gair said.
In the months before the killing, friends had become concerned about the couple's relationship, the court heard.
Mr Gair said: "You will hear evidence that he would take umbrage at her working with other young men and displayed a controlling nature, telling her for example what she could and could not wear."
The trial continues.
