[SN]TITLE[SN]
Muddied waters for Yorkshire's first executive mayor

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
There are a couple of snags with the idea that a democratically-elected executive mayor will take control of the new powers being handed down from central government to the nine councils agreeing to be part of the Sheffield City Region.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
First, a third of the electorate will not be allowed to vote for the new mayor in the polls scheduled for 2017.
Secondly, the mayor's powers will not cover the entire region.
Funnily enough, neither of these issues was given much prominence in the avalanche of press releases and interviews on the day the deal was announced on 2 October.
George Osborne himself, on a high-profile flying visit to Sheffield to sign the deal with council leaders, called it the biggest reform of local government in a generation.
"For local people it will mean the decisions that affect them being taken locally," he said.
He never mentioned that only some "local people" will be part of the democratic process in electing a mayor.
So why is it that this first step since the Chancellor appealed to councils across the country to join his "devolution revolution" appears to be heading straight into a muddy political puddle?
The template was for a "Boris Johnson-style" powerful mayor using the authority of a mandate from the local electorate to boost the economy of a cluster of neighbouring local authorities.
The mayor would control transport and travel policies, drive inward investment and industrial training, as well as keeping the police on their toes by replacing the Crime Commissioner.
That was exactly how devolution was sold to Greater Manchester last year and was the basis of the 38 separate bids that emerged this spring from different permutations of local councils across the country for a similar deal.
That template has cracked at it first outing because creating devolution is proving far more complicated than drawing up a boundary on a map.
The Sheffield City region highlights the problem.
It is made up of four South Yorkshire authorities: the city itself together with neighbours Barnsley, Doncaster and Rotherham.
As their combined population of around 1.3 million was not considered big enough to create a viable economy the adjacent smaller councils of Bassetlaw, Bolsover, Chesterfield, North East Derbyshire and Derbyshire Dales were persuaded to sign up and add a further half million people.
However, those smaller authorities are over the border from South Yorkshire where legal control of public transport and highways budgets are in the hands of the county councils of Derbyshire and Nottinghamshire.
Those county councils have absolutely no intention of handing over a single drop of their powers to the new devolved region about to move in next door.
So the confusing compromise is to totally exclude the voters who live in those smaller councils from the mayoral election.
That same boundary dispute complication completely knocks out the idea of the Sheffield Mayor becoming Police and Crime Commissioner as both Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire have their own separate forces.
Is this a unique problem for the cross-border Sheffield City Region?
The answer to that lies up the road in the ambitions for a mayor-led Leeds City region.
At its heart are the five West Yorkshire local authorities of Leeds, Bradford, Calderdale, Kirklees and Wakefield.
However, it also plans to slip over into North Yorkshire to take in the smaller authorities of Harrogate, Craven, Selby and the City of York.
To say that North Yorkshire County Council, the current transport and highways authority, is not amused by this proposal would be something of an understatement.
Not surprisingly, so far there is no indication of when, or even if, the announcement over the creation of the Leeds City Region will be made.
