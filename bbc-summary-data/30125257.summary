Raven-Symone first appeared on the hit series aged just three.
On her Instagram the 28-year-old said: "I was NOT taken advantage of by Mr Cosby when I was on the Cosby Show! I was practically a baby on that show and this is truly a disgusting rumour that I want no part of!
"Everyone on that show treated me with nothing but kindness.
Now keep me out of this!"
The comments were in response to an article posted online, which has been shared over 160,000 times. It alleges the actress had revealed "that she too had been raped and drugged years ago following the show's last episode".
The actor starred as Cosby's step-granddaughter, Olivia, from 1989 till 1992. Bill Cosby is one of the biggest names in US comedy and a hero to many younger comedians.
Earlier this week former supermodel Janice Dickinson claimed in a US TV interview that Cosby sexually assaulted her after giving her a glass of wine and a pill.
The 59-year-old is the third woman to make rape accusations against the actor. Cosby has so far declined to comment on the allegations.
Cosby's lawyer, Martin Singer, said that Dickinson's allegations were "false and outlandish".
Following the latest sexual assault allegations against him, US TV network NBC has scrapped a proposed project with comedian.
