[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An incredible 25-yard volley from Dele Alli helped Tottenham come from a goal behind to defeat Crystal Palace.

The hosts went ahead when Wilfried Zaha's cross was turned into his own net by Spurs defender Jan Vertonghen.
But Harry Kane gave Tottenham a deserved equaliser when he powerfully headed in Nacer Chadli's dinked cross.
Alli then flicked the ball up, then back over his own head and volleyed into the bottom corner, before Chadli curled in a late third goal.

Tottenham have never finished in the top three of the Premier League, and this was a huge test of their character - and they passed it with flying colours.
This well-deserved victory keeps them only five points behind surprise leaders Leicester, but they had to show their fighting spirit. They were frustrated by a well-organised Palace team, who took a shock lead through Vertonghen's first-half own goal.
But three pieces of skill saw Spurs fight back for the win. Kane's header maintained a remarkable run of form that has now seen him score 12 times in his past 14 Premier League appearances.
Alli, who is only 19, showed wonderful composure to take a touch 25 yards out, flick the ball back over his head to deceive Palace's Mile Jedinak, and then volley past Wayne Hennessey.
A third goal, a stunning finish from Chadli, in the third minute of injury time made the match look a bit more comfortable then it was and was harsh on a battling home side.
It is now six league games without a win for Alan Pardew's Crystal Palace, although they did manage to end one poor run as their goal was the side's first in 482 minutes - though it was scored by Tottenham's Vertonghen.
However, Pardew can remain upbeat. With the score at 1-1 his side forced Hugo Lloris into a fine save to deny Wilfried Zaha.
The Eagles then hit the woodwork twice in a matter of seconds as Scott Dann headed Jason Puncheon's free-kick against the underside of the bar, before substitute Mile Jedinak also hit the crossbar with a shot on the turn.
Palace's defeat sees them drop to 11th and Pardew thinks a new signing would lift their spirits. "We're looking to bring a player in and there's no doubt about that," he said.
"The boys would like to see someone else enter the dressing room."
Tottenham and England midfielder Dele Alli described his goal by saying: "It was natural instinct. It was a great ball and I just took a touch and hit it," said the 19-year-old.
"It all came naturally. I didn't have time to think. I didn't know what to do in my celebration!"
Tottenham boss Mauricio Pochettino: "Dele Alli's goal was fantastic and it showed his quality. It is a goal that will be seen around the world on television. We knew he was a player of unbelievable potential, but today he showed unbelievable maturity and quality."
Tottenham striker Harry Kane: "I've never scored a goal like that and I haven't seen one as good as that for a long time."
Crystal Palace manager Alan Pardew: "It was horrible to watch, and I don't often say that about a beautiful goal. As soon as he flicked the ball over his head I feared the worst. It was a great moment for him and he is a great talent."
Crystal Palace manager Alan Pardew: "We wouldn't have lost the game if it hadn't been for their goalkeeper. At 1-1 he made two great saves and it was just not our day.
"Wilfried Zaha was a problem for them and on another day we could've won this game.
"We haven't done much wrong, but they have great individual talent and they won it with a couple of special moments."

Tottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino: "After the first half I was a bit disappointed but we sorted out some problems and with the maturity we showed in the second half we fully deserved the win.
"After 95 minutes the result was fair. It was a fantastic performance.
"We have the youngest squad in the Premier League, but the way the players showed their maturity it looked like the oldest."
It is FA Cup fourth-round action next up for both of these sides. Palace host Premier League rivals Stoke next Saturday, while Spurs face a trip to League One strugglers Colchester United.
