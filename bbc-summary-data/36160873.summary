The 46-year-old former England Saxons prop has been with the Premiership club since 2012.
He joins ex-Saracens defence coach Paul Gustard and ex-Bristol forwards coach Steve Borthwick as part of England boss Eddie Jones' backroom team following his appointment in November.
"I'd like to thank Bath Rugby for their understanding," said Hatley.
"Being asked by Eddie Jones to be part of the national team's coaching staff is a real honour, and a special moment for me and my family.
"It's been a real privilege to have been part of Bath Rugby these past four years."
Bath currently lie ninth in the Premiership table with two matches remaining.
"We're delighted to have brought Neal into the coaching team," said Jones. "Successful English rugby teams have always had strong, powerful, dominant scrums.
"Neal is an experienced coach and has impressed me with the work he has done in English rugby. We're looking forward to working with him ahead of the game against Wales and tour to Australia."
Bath head coach Mike Ford added: "Neal's work with our forwards has been exemplary, so it's no great surprise that England have come calling.
"As a club, we've now got a good opportunity to take a look out our coaching structure so that everything is in place ahead of a new campaign next season."
