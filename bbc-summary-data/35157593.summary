[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
World number six Robert Thornton suffered a shock 3-0 defeat against Alan Norris of England in round one of the World Darts Championship.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The world number 49, from Yeovil, won the first set 3-0 and the second on the deciding leg.
Scot Thornton, who beat Michael van Gerwen to win the World Grand Prix, had a 121 checkout on the bull but Norris won out and will now face Joe Murnan.
World number eight Michael Smith ousted Jeffrey de Zwaan after a tie-break.
At 5-5 in the fifth set, Smith was closest to the bull to throw first and eventually found double four to see off his 19-year-old Dutch opponent and set up a meeting with Steve Beaton.
James Wade also progressed to the second round with a routine 3-0 defeat of John Michael, who had earlier overcome Warrick Scheffer 2-0 in the preliminary round.
