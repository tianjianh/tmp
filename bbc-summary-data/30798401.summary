Taylor, 29, who can play left-wing or left-back, only joined the Stags last summer on a one-year contract following his release by Port Vale.
Molyneux joins after being released by Crewe where the 25-year-old made just six starts in 18 months.
The pair follow Steve Jennings and Rory Donnelly in January moves to Rovers.
Taylor, who started his career in non-league with Redditch United, first entered League football in 2008 when he signed for Vale from Nuneaton Town.
"Rob's a player I've worked with before and I'm delighted to bring him to Tranmere," said Adams.
"He's able to play anywhere down the left and up front and will strengthen our squad for the second half of the season."
Former Everton youth product Molyneux has also played for Port Vale and Plymouth and returned for a third spell at Accrington on loan in October.
