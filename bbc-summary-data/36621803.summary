"I'm delighted to be here," Gloucester-born Edwards told Walsall's website.
"I've played against Walsall a few times before and they have always been a very good footballing side."
Manager Jon Whitney added: "Joe is an experienced front-foot defender who is a leader on and off the pitch.
"I have been impressed with his performances when he has played against us over the years and he will be a valuable and influential member of the squad."
