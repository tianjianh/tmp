Trainer Jean-Claude Rouget said the winner of the French versions of the 1,000 Guineas and Oaks, who was second favourite for the Arc, has a "problem".
"We don't know exactly what it is," he said. "She has to have an examination. The problem is towards the back."
Only Roger Varian's Postponed was ahead of her in the ante-post market for the race at Chantilly, which is run over one-and-a-half miles.
The traditional venue, Longchamp racecourse in Paris, is being renovated and will re-open in September 2017.

This is a considerable blow to this year's staging of the Arc. La Cressonniere was amongst a relatively small number of major players, having emerged as one of the outstanding fillies in Europe with wins in the French equivalent of Britain's 1,000 Guineas and Oaks Classic-races.
Her prospects of success seemed to be further boosted by the much-quoted stat that four of the last five stagings of European flat racing's greatest prize were won by female horses. On a brighter note, La Cressonniere's absence would appear to make the task facing British-trained favourite Postponed that much easier.
