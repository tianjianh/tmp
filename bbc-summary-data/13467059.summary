A baby girl whose body was found at a waste management site in Bradford may have died several days before she was found, police have said.

The baby was found by staff at the firm in Valley Road, Bradford, in the early hours of Thursday.
West Yorkshire Police said a post-mortem examination had confirmed the girl may have died two or three days before she was found.
The examination proved inconclusive for the cause of death.
Police said it was "unlikely" the baby, who was white, had been born in hospital.
They also said they were not ruling out the possibility the baby may have been from an area of West Yorkshire other than Leeds and Bradford.
Inquiries revealed the waste management site received 97 loads of waste on Wednesday, 51 of which were from Bradford while the remainder were from elsewhere in the county.
Det Supt Sukhbir Singh said the police remained "greatly concerned for the mother's condition and welfare".
"Our focus continues to be to identify this baby's mother and I would urge her friends, relatives and neighbours to contact West Yorkshire Police.
"Somebody in West Yorkshire must know who the mother of this child is and I would ask them to provide the key piece of information we need to find her."
Staff working at the company who discovered the body have been offered counselling.
Det Supt Sukhbir Singh said: "They were clearly distressed by the discovery.
"They are being provided with and offered the support that they need."
