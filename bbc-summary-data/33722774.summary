Adult colouring book brings Millie Marotta top 10 success

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Artist Millie Marotta never imagined she would be one of Britain's best-selling authors, but that is exactly what her adult colouring books have helped her achieve.

Her book Animal Kingdom - A Colouring Book Adventure currently tops Amazon's best sellers list and she is part of an industry which saw almost one million books worth Â£6m sold so far this year.
But as she starts work on her third book, she looks back on her success with a mixture of pride and shock.
Ms Marotta, who grew up in Aberystwyth, Ceredigion, before moving to Tenby, Pembrokeshire, described her new-found fame as "really amazing", adding: "I just wanted to make beautiful books and I'm really flattered that people enjoy them so much."
When she started, her aim was to create a book people would love colouring as much as she enjoyed creating the illustrations.
But the idea for the books originally came from her publishers. They spotted the adult colouring phenomenon as it gathered momentum in France, and believed Ms Marotta's intricate style of drawing would be ideal for hobbyists looking for new inspiration.
Since then a huge colouring "community" has grown up around the books.
Friends Natasha Trew-Burns, Val Hall, Malissa King and Sarah England, from Newport, met through one of the many colouring groups on Facebook.
They now meet regularly to share books, pens and colouring tips and agree one of the big attractions is the freedom it provides from the modern world's digital distractions.
Ms King said colouring brings instant gratification.
"You can sit down with a picture and have it finished by the end of the evening, but when you look at what other people have done with the same picture they're all completely different and I like that about it," she said.
But all four admitted it was all too easy to get addicted to the different types of pens and pencils available.
And with sets costing as much as Â£250, it can quickly become an expensive hobby.
Andre Breedt from Nielsen Book Services has been monitoring sales of adult colouring titles and believes they are here to stay.
He said they make popular gifts, and predicts they will be a Christmas hit.
He added the number of colouring books on the market was forecast to double over the next six months and so far demand shows no signs of waning.
