Martin Cassidy's side will also take on Menorca and Orkney in Gotland in June.
Holders Guernsey will meet the Shetland Islands, Saaremaa and Aland, and could face a repeat of the 2015 final against the Isle of Man in the last four.
Jersey women are up against the Isle of Wight and Gibraltar as they defend their crown, while Guernsey are not taking a side to the Swedish island.
Dates for the fixtures will be confirmed on 8 February, with only group-winners making it into the men's semi-finals.
Tim Pryor, Channel Islands Sports Editor
I think the Channel Islands teams will be relatively happy with their draws.
All the Channel Islands managed to avoid the hosts, Gotland, and as reigning men's champions Guernsey will definitely fancy their chances of topping their group and going through to the semi-finals.
Because of the way the tournament is structured, Guernsey would not meet Jersey, Menorca or the hosts until the final, if they get that far, but a Guernsey v Isle of Man semi-final is an exciting possibility in a repeat of the 2015 final.
Jersey's men again find themselves paired with Alderney - the Reds won 6-0 when the sides met at the last Games.
The Isle of Wight women face a tricky-looking group against 2015 champions Jersey and Gibraltar. Aland will be among the favourites to go all the way.
