[SN]TITLE[SN]
Technip UK Limited fined over death on North Sea vessel

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A company has been fined for breaches of health and safety law following the death of a worker on a diving support vessel.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Technip UK was fined Â£160,000 at Aberdeen Sheriff Court.
The case followed the death of David Stephenson on the vessel Wellservicer in April 2009.
He was injured in an accident close to Aberdeen harbour. Although he was flown to Aberdeen Royal Infirmary, he was later pronounced dead.
Maritime and Coastguard Agency head of enforcement Jeremy Smart said: "This was a tragic incident which should never have happened and our sympathies go out to the family of Mr Stephenson.
"This incident clearly demonstrates that proper risk assessments need to be conducted before any operation is undertaken and the appropriate safety measures put in place.
"Safety failings like this are not acceptable in any industry."
