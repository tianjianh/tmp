The 33-year-old, who has won seven Grand Tours, has spent the last six years with Tinkoff but they are folding at the end of this season.
Contador is one of only six riders to have won all three Grand Tours, although he has not won the Tour de France since 2009.
"The big objective is to try and win the most important races - first and foremost the Tour de France," he said.
"Trek-Segafredo is a very attractive and ambitious project that really inspires me. I am convinced that this team can provide me with the best structure and bring me in the best conditions to the races."
The US-registered team have also brought in Contador's long-term domestique, Jesus Hernandez, and Tinkoff directeur sportif Steven de Jongh.
