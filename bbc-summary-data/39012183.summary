[SN]TITLE[SN]
Everton v Sunderland

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Everton striker Romelu Lukaku is available to face Sunderland following a minor calf problem.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
James McCarthy and Kevin Mirallas return after recovering from hamstring and groin injuries respectively.
Sunderland goalkeeper Jordan Pickford is fit again after a knee problem and could make his first appearance since Boxing Day in place of Vito Mannone.
Jan Kirchhoff is back in training but will not be involved, while Steven Pienaar is doubtful with a calf injury.
Papy Djilobodji serves the last match of his suspension.
Alistair Mann: "David Moyes' 11-year tenure at Everton was heralded as one of encouraging progress and consistency.
"It's worth bearing in mind that the primary task on his appointment there in March 2002 was to steer them away from relegation trouble.
"His aim at Sunderland has been the same and, with limited funds in addition to a crippling injury list, it's only been his sagely managerial nous which has kept the Black Cats from sinking without trace.
"With Everton on a European quest and in imperious form, there will be little evidence of sentiment for the club's third-longest serving manager.
"Factor in a number of ex-Everton employees within Moyes' squad and we're guaranteed a fascinating afternoon."

Everton manager Ronald Koeman: "If you are sloppy they will punish you for that. We are full of confidence but we have to show a good level on the pitch.
"The team are happy to keep the momentum. We know we are strong, but it's football and we need to keep the momentum."
Sunderland manager David Moyes: "I want to go back to Everton and win. We need the three points and I want to win there with Sunderland.
"Lukaku is a really good player and Everton are famed for their number nines - he fits that mould. We need to stop him."
Everton have not lost in the league since the Merseyside derby before Christmas - and they were unlucky to be beaten in that game.
But I just have a feeling Sunderland will get something here. They will have their chances, and I think they might find a way of picking up a point.
