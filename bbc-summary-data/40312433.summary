Beachgoers saw a "massive fire" spread quickly up East Cliff on Bournemouth beach at about 15.30 BST.
Firefighters said a patch of gorse was alight behind some beach huts near Undercliff Drive and Pier Approach and part of the promenade was evacuated.
Dorset Police advised people to avoid the area and said no injuries had been reported.
Bournemouth Council said its seafront rangers guided beachgoers away from danger and ensured the area was clear.
Bournemouth East MP Tobias Ellwood posted on Twitter: "Huge praise for Bournemouth's Emergency Services in responding to major grass fire that spread rapidly on East Cliff cliff top above packed beach."
