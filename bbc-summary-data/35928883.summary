Pakistan head coach Waqar Younis has blamed Shahid Afridi's "poor captaincy" for the country's group-stage exit from the World Twenty20.

In a critical six-page report to the Pakistan Cricket Board, Waqar said he did not want to "shift the blame to any personal individual but to identify where things did not go right".
The 2009 champions beat Bangladesh, but suffered defeats by India, New Zealand and Australia and were jeered by fans.
Waqar's current contract ends in May.
Despite claiming he was not singling out individuals, Waqar made critical comments relating to Afridi's captaincy and the troublesome attitude of batsman Umar Akmal.
Waqar's report contained the following claims:
Waqar, who "begged forgiveness from the nation" on Tuesday, has also given the PCB a list of 13 recommendations, according to Cricinfo. They include:
The team were jeered on their return to Lahore airport, with huge crowds chanting "Shame! Shame!"
Former fast bowler Waqar, in charge as head coach for a second time, suggested that Akmal was finding it too easy to retain his place despite questionable behaviour.
Waqar was angry that the batsman missed a training camp in Lahore last year to play for Guyana Amazon Warriors in the Caribbean Premier League.
The coach wrote: "Are we bold enough to take this step or do we fear the media or pressure from different people to play certain players?
"Andrew Symonds was a very talented player for Australia or Kevin Pietersen for England, but due to their behaviour they were dropped and never picked again irrespective of their talent."
Captain Afridi, 36, is expected to announce soon whether he will be retiring from internationals.
Waqar added: "We lost to New Zealand, Asia Cup and the World Twenty20, due to poor captaincy.
"No matter how many times I talk to the players, it is the captain who has to lead the boys on the field and execute the plan."
