[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The first five goals came in the first half after The Coasters led when Henry Jones received Danny Rowe's through ball and slotted past Nathan Ashmore.
Rowe finished off a pass from Jack Muldoon minutes later to double the lead, but Ebbsfleet responded when a deep Myles Weston cross found Kenny Clark free at the back post to loop in a header.
Danny Kedwell then levelled, before Sam Finley fired the away side back in front after taking a corner ball on the edge of the box.
Drury's late drilled shot below Rhys Taylor came a minute from time.
