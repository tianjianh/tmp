The bird, powered by a Rohm microcontroller, has been enhanced with two extra wings since its appearance last year.
But as BBC Click reporter Dan Simmons found out, it can be a little tricky to control.
BBC Click will have more from Ceatec on this weekend's television show. Find out more at BBC.com/Click and @BBCClick.
