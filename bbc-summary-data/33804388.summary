The 65-year-old was shot at his home on Sandpit Lane, in South Weald, near Brentwood, Essex, on 24 June.
Police initially thought he had had a cardiac arrest and did not realise for nearly a week he had been shot.
A 43-year-old man from Rugby has been arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to commit murder in connection with the inquiry, Essex Police said.
Palmer was jailed for eight years in 2001 for masterminding a timeshare fraud targeting people across the UK.
A year later, he was ordered to hand over £35m, but the ruling was overturned on a technicality.
Det Ch Insp Simon Werrett, who is leading the murder investigation, said: "This is a positive development but we are continuing to appeal for witnesses to any suspicious activity in the area.
"Sandpit Lane is a popular spot for joggers and dog-walkers and I am particularly keen to hear from anyone who was in the vicinity between 16:00 BST and 18:00 BST on Wednesday, June 24."
The arrested man has been released on police bail until 23 September pending further inquiries.
Palmer's wealth was once estimated at £300m, according to an Underworld Rich List compiled for the BBC in 2004.
He owned helicopters, a French chateau and a £1m mansion in Bath, and was once considered one of the biggest landowners on Tenerife.
