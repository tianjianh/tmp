The batsman, 31, took over when Hashim Amla made the shock decision to quit midway through the 2-1 series defeat.
"I am confident he will lead by example and display the brilliance and passion he is so blessed with," said Cricket South Africa chief Haroon Lorgat.
De Villiers will lead South Africa in the home series against New Zealand that starts in August.
"I have been privileged to play in several outstanding Proteas teams over the past 11 seasons," said de Villiers.
"I believe we are witnessing the emergence of another great team."
South Africa lost the third Test against England to go 2-0 down in the series but won the final match by 280 runs.
