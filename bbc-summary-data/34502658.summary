Winnie Blagden, from Sheffield, was sent cards from across the world after a Facebook post by BBC Radio Sheffield was seen by millions of people.
The appeal, launched after it was discovered she had no surviving friends and family, got responses from Prime Minister David Cameron and actor Dustin Hoffman.
Mrs Blagden died at her home on Sunday.
Speaking to BBC Radio Sheffield, Winnie, who celebrated the milestone birthday on 31 May, said: "When I die I don't want anyone to be sad. I want them to remember the good times we had."
Her birthday was marked with a surprise party at Sheffield City Hall.
Mrs Blagden did not have children and had no known relatives following the death of her husband George 30 years ago.
Hundreds of the cards sent, some which came from as far afield as the US, Australia, New Zealand, Romania and Japan, went on display at Sheffield's Winter Garden.
Martyn Weston, managing editor of BBC Radio Sheffield, said: "Winnie's story touched the hearts of people around the world and the response to our appeal was extraordinary and moving.
"Winnie was a little overwhelmed by what happened - as we all were. But she thoroughly deserved and enjoyed the attention.
"She was a lovely woman and it is wonderful to think our listeners, and kind-hearted people from around the world, came together to make her last birthday so special."
