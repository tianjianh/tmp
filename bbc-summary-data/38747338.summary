Six contemporary artists are on the Artes Mundi shortlist, including Welsh artist Bedwyr Williams.
The winner will be announced at the National Museum of Wales on Thursday evening.
This is the seventh time the prize has been awarded - in 2015, winner Theaster Gates shared his £40,000 prize with the nine other shortlisted artists.
Entrants this year represent countries including Lebanon, Angola and the USA.
The final six were chosen from a field of more than 700 nominations from 90 countries.
