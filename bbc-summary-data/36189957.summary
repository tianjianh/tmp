[SN]TITLE[SN]
Bailey Gwynne death review to begin

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An independent inquiry is to begin into the circumstances surrounding the death of a 16-year-old boy at his Aberdeen school.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Bailey Gwynne was stabbed by a fellow pupil at Cults Academy in October.
His killer, also 16, was last month jailed for nine years after being found guilty of culpable homicide.
The review will look at the relationship between the boys, as well as the educational, pastoral, health and social care services provided.
It will examine whether the services were "proportionate to the assessment of risk".
The inquiry was commissioned by Aberdeen City Council, the police and NHS Grampian after Bailey was fatally stabbed in a fight which started over a biscuit.
In March, BBC Scotland revealed that concerns about the killer, who cannot be named for legal reasons, were voiced nine years ago when, as a primary pupil, he threw rocks at another child.
The incident resulted in the victim being treated for concussion.
The inquiry is being led by Andrew Lowe, chairman of child and adult protection for Renfrewshire, and will be published in September.
The former lawyer, will have access to all the necessary case files from the council, health board, the police and the Scottish Children's Reporter.
He will also be able to draw on any additional independent professional expertise he requires to meet the terms of the review.
