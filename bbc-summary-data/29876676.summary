India and Pakistan have held a daily military ceremony at their only land border crossing, a day after a suicide attack there killed dozens of people.

Despite earlier plans to suspend the ritual at Wagah, Pakistan's military said it wanted the nation to unite against terrorism.
The bomb exploded near the checkpoint on the Pakistani side, killing at least 55 people and injuring many more.
Funerals of those killed have been taking place across Punjab province.
Punjab army corps commander Lt-Gen Naveed Zaman told those present at Monday's ceremony that they "proved that terrorists can't break the morale and zeal of the nation".
Indian soldiers also took part on their side of the frontier. There were cheers on the Pakistani side but no spectators on the Indian side.
It would have been the first time the Wagah ritual had been called off since the two countries fought a war in 1971.
"Flag lowering ceremony at #Wagah Border held with same fervour - shows resolve of the nation", Pakistani military spokesman Asim Bajwal tweeted.
The colourful ceremony at Wagah takes place at sunset every day, with large, enthusiastic and patriotic crowds ensconced in galleries on both sides of the border.
Goose-stepping border guards in full ceremonial uniform march and confront each other in dramatic style as the two flags are brought down.
A salute and handshake is followed by the gates on either side being slammed shut.
So the suicide attack on the Pakistani side at Wagah has raised concerns not just because it happened in a highly secure area, but also because it took place in Punjab, Pakistan's most populous and prosperous province.
Why attack Wagah crossing?
The Pakistani Taliban (TTP) said they were behind the bombing. Two other militant groups - Jundullah and the Jamaat-ul-Ahrar faction of the TTP - also said they carried it out.
Sunday's attack is the deadliest to hit Pakistan in many months.
The Wagah crossing is a high-profile target, with large crowds gathering every day to watch an elaborate and colourful flag-lowering ceremony as the border closes.
Witnesses described scenes of horror in the wake of the blast which struck just after Sunday's ceremony took place.
One intelligence official, who was in his office at the time, told Reuters he saw "scattered bodies, injured men, women and children and smashed cars".
Social media users in Pakistan have expressed anger at the country's government for not doing enough to prevent Sunday's bombing.
On Twitter many recalled a piece run by a local newspaper, the Naya Akhbar, which published an apparent warning of an attack just days before the explosion, quoting information from security sources.
"Agencies inform them before & its published on 28 Oct in a local news paper of Lahore," exclaimed â€
