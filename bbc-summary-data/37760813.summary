[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Australia have named Marika Koroibete in their squad for the autumn Tests in Europe before the rugby league convert has even made his Super Rugby debut.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Koroibete, 24, who has yet to complete his switch to rugby union for Melbourne Rebels, turned out for Melbourne Storm in Australia's Grand Final this month.
The wing is one of three uncapped players for the five-Test tour, which starts against Wales on 5 November.
Centre Samu Kerevi is out after surgery on an ankle injury.
The 23-year-old, who has scored three tries in eight Tests, was hurt in Saturday's 37-10 defeat by New Zealand.
After facing Wales in Cardiff, Australia go on to play other Tests against Scotland, Ireland and France before completing the tour against England on 3 December.
Coach Michael Cheika has included Will Genia in his squad but the scrum-half will miss the Tests against England and Wales.
The 28-year-old plays for Stade Francais and the matches at Twickenham and the Principality Stadium fall outside the international release window when World Rugby, the sport's governing body, obliges clubs worldwide to release players to their countries.
There is no room for Toulon pair Matt Giteau and Drew Mitchell or Bordeaux Begles' Adam Ashley-Cooper despite the trio all meeting the Wallabies' eligibility criteria of 60 caps and at least seven years under contract to Australian Rugby.
Wing Koroibete has not played union since he was at school in Fiji.
The 24-year-old sprinter has scored 34 tries in 58 matches for Melbourne Storm in the National Rugby League and played against Cronulla in the Grand Final on 1 October.
Brumbies fly-half Kyle Godwin and Waratahs hooker Tolu Latu are the other uncapped players in the tour party.
