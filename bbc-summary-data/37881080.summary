[SN]TITLE[SN]
Swindon Town 3-0 Charlton Athletic

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Tim Sherwood's reign as Swindon Town's director of football began with an impressive victory over mid-table Charlton Athletic.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Jon Goddard and Sean Murray had good early chances for the Robins before Murray's deflected shot gave them a deserved lead shortly before half-time.
Lloyd Jones made it two soon after the break as he converted Michael Doughty's flick-on from a corner.
Goddard sealed the win, thumping home Yaser Kasim's pass from eight yards.
The win was only Swindon's fifth in League One this season and first in five games in all competitions, while Charlton lost for the first time in seven and conceded more than two goals for the first time this term.
Sherwood was brought in by Swindon on Thursday to support head coach Luke Williams in a move described by the club's chairman Lee Power as "one of the biggest appointments the club has ever made."
