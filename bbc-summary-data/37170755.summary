He joins from a club in South Africa, having also played in Holland, Hungary, Norway, Finland, Greece and Malta.
Bright, 29,  has also previously played for Shrewsbury Town and Lincoln City.
"He comes to us highly rated. He's a tall strong forward who will increase our striking options and give us something different up front," said Linfield manager David Healy.
"We just have to await his international clearance to be processed before he can play for us.
"I've been searching high and low, far and near for a striker to increase our competition levels in attack and I'm delighted that Kris has come all this way to sign for us.
"I'm looking forward to starting work with him in the weeks ahead and no doubt, our supporters will give him a very warm welcome to the club," added the former Northern Ireland international.
Linfield lie third in the Irish Premiership after the first four rounds of fixtures, two points behind leaders Ards, and will host Dungannon Swifts in their next game on Saturday.
