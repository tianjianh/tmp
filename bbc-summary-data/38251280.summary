Plymouth Argyle defensive midfielder Yann Songo'o says he will be "a little bit more aggressive" after avoiding a fifth yellow card and a suspension.

The 25-year-old had to last seven games before the 30 November cut-off date to avoid a one-match ban.
"That was annoying me a little bit," the Cameroonian told BBC Sport.
"It was a difficult period because I'm an aggressive player, so it was quite difficult for me to hold myself in certain situations."
He continued: "I'm not looking to get yellow cards but I will definitely be a little bit more aggressive now."
The Pilgrims have gone four matches without a win and slipped to third in League Two, having been seven points clear at the top at one stage.
They have scored just one goal in that period, with strikers Jimmy Spencer and Arnold Garita both injured.
"I think the loss of Jimmy Spencer was a big loss for us upfront, so after that you have to adjust the team and make a new formation," added Songo'o.
"If we can lose three games, have another run of 15 games (unbeaten) and then lose another three, I will take that all day."
