Guildford council delays Clay Lane Link Road planning application

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A proposal to improve access to a major Surrey industrial estate is to be delayed for up to 18 months following public consultation.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Guildford council is keen to connect Slyfield Industrial Estate with Clay Lane, in Jacobs Well, via a link road.
But it said residents were concerned about the effect on Highways England's plans for an A3 upgrade.
The council now plans to take more time - until plans for the A3 are clearer - before submitting an application.
Guildford Borough Council said the industrial estate was an important economic hub, providing more than 2,000 jobs.
It believes the link road - which would cost an estimated Â£7.3m - would attract new business and create many more jobs.
The proposal is made up of two phases - the road infrastructure within the industrial estate and the actual link road.
The council said it had been assured by Highways England that the link road proposal would have no effect on its A3 plans.
But the council said it was keen to see how the A3 plans developed to ensure they would not change the design of a second access to the estate.
At a council meeting on 23 February it will now seek to delay the planning application for the second phase, until A3 plans are clearer, taking a decision to submit an application for the first phase only.
