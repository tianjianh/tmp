New Zealand produced another dominant second-half performance to crush battling Wales in Wellington.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Alun Wyn Jones' 38th-minute try tied the scores 10-10 at the interval.
But inspired by replacement fly-half Beauden Barrett, the All Blacks scored four tries after the break through Ben Smith, Barrett, Waiseke Naholo and Ardie Savea.
Liam Williams and Jonathan Davies scored in a late flurry, but Wales have now not beaten the Kiwis in 28 games.
Barrett was on the field following a serious-looking neck injury to Aaron Cruden who was taken off on a buggy in the first half
After their 39-21 loss in the first Test, Wales' management had warned their players they needed an 80-minute performance against the world champions.
But again the tourists could not live with the All Blacks in a crucial 14-minute period after the break in when they scored four tries.
It might have been different if Taulupe Faletau had held on to a pass from Sam Warburton who had intercepted in the 51st minute with the scores still tied.
The pass went to ground and within a minute Smith had crossed for New Zealand's second try as the hosts put their foot on the accelerator.
Again Wales gave as good as they got in the first half, dominating possession in the early phases, but having only Biggar's 15th minute penalty to show for it.
The All Blacks made no mistake on their first visit to the Welsh 22, Aaron Smith brilliantly exploiting a narrow defence with Israel Dagg dummying his way over to mark his 50th cap with a try.
The long break for Cruden's injury disrupted the momentum, before Wales struck on the stroke of half time.
Jonathan Davies brushed past Barrett to set up the attack and then sent a long pass to Jones loitering on the left-hand touchline who scored his ninth Test try in his 101st Wales game.  Biggar converted to level the scores.
Wales held their own and had a sniff of taking the lead with Warburton's interception before Barrett turned on the style.
He created a try for Smith and then scored between the posts. Naholo's third try in two Tests meant New Zealand had scored 19 points in eight minutes to take the game away from Wales.
Savea's try made it 36-10 with 14 minutes to play and Wales were looking down the barrel of a potential cricket score.
Williams capped a fine display by running in from half-way before Davies rounded-off a move from Jamie Roberts' interception with a thunderous hand-off and an assist by Rhys Priestland.
New Zealand coach Steve Hansen: "There was a lot more clarity about what we were trying to do.
"There were big improvements across the board, our line out was much better and the scrum as well.
"You'd still expect a lot of improvement [for the third Test]."
Wales coach Warren Gatland: "I'm pretty proud about that performance. There were a couple of key moments which were the difference.
"We had 58% territory and possession tonight and that's a massive number against the All Blacks, we've never done that before."
