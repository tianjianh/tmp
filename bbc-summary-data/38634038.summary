[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Alzheimer's Society is to close all its Surrey day centres blaming a lack of funding and declining attendance.

The centres in Byfleet and Haslemere are due to close in March with the Bletchingley centre closing in June.
Chris Wyatt from the society said: "They are underused because people are not able to get a personal budget to come to the day centres."
Surrey County Council said the centres were "vastly underused" and would be looking for alternative services.
The Alzheimer's Society said about 115 people used the society's Surrey day centres.
Ms Wyatt, the South East's area manager for the society said: "Not very long ago we had six day centres across Surrey that were well attended and well funded.
"We are down to three day centres and we're faced with closing them as well.
"They are underused because people are not able to get a personal budget to come to the day centres."
The society said a lack of affordable transport meant many clients could not attend day centres without the support of a carer.
"Nobody is getting the right level of support and care they need," Ms Wyatt said.
Surrey County Council said it would be looking for alternative places for day centre users.
A spokesman said: "This will not be any easy task with the huge financial pressures we face to deliver our services, in particular adult social care where we face a funding gap running into tens of millions of pounds."
