[SN]TITLE[SN]
Republic of Ireland 0-0 England

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
England's first visit to Dublin since the riot that caused the abandonment of their infamous 1995 friendly ended in a dismal draw with the Republic of Ireland.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Football Association had written to all 3,000 travelling England fans asking them to behave in the Irish capital and any fears of more trouble were unfounded as the friendly was played out in a peaceful atmosphere.
Both anthems were immaculately observed before kick-off, and the only sign of any tension came when some Ireland supporters whistled as England fans sang God Save The Queen during the game.
The game itself was a massive disappointment, however. England and Ireland were using the game to prepare for their Euro 2016 qualifiers next week but it was almost totally devoid of the intensity they can expect in those competitive encounters.
It took England 44 minutes to muster an effort at goal, when Adam Lallana fired over from distance, and they did not force Keiren Westwood into a save until Wayne Rooney's tame free-kick just before the hour mark.
Rooney had few opportunities to get any nearer to Sir Bobby Charlton's goalscoring record of 49, but his below-par display was summed up by a terrible touch when he was put through on goal.
Raheem Sterling also had an ineffective afternoon and could not escape his contract issues at Liverpool either, with some fans booing him until he was replaced midway through the second half.
Ireland, who host Scotland here on Saturday in a game that is crucial to their chances of reaching France, fared slightly better when they came forward.
But Daryl Murphy wasted their best first half chances, firing wide when the ball dropped to him in the box and failing to find the target with a header from Seamus Coleman's free-kick.
That sort of finishing meant England keeper Joe Hart's only save of note came when Ireland substitute Jon Walters fired straight at him midway through the second half.
A flurry of changes from both teams followed, including the introduction of Jamie Vardy, who replaced England captain Rooney to make his international debut.
Sadly for Vardy, the former Stocksbridge Steels striker did not get a single sniff in front of goal during his 16 minutes on the pitch and Hodgson will have learned little about his credentials at this level.
Few of Vardy's team-mates did anything of note either. Andros Townsend tested Ireland's substitute keeper Shay Given with a low drive before the end but that was the best England could muster in front of goal.
England's wait for a first win over Ireland since 1985 goes on but they did at least extend their unbeaten run since last summer's World Cup to nine games.
However, this lacklustre display did little to reflect the improvements they have made in recent months and Hodgson must hope it is not repeated when they play Lithuania next weekend.
