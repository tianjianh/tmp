Will Kristen Wiig's Ghostbusters kickstart a whole new franchise?

You wait more than 15 years for a new Ghostbusters film, and then two come along at the same time.

We already know Bridesmaids director Paul Feig is rebooting the franchise, with Kristen Wiig and Melissa McCarthy leading a female-fronted cast.
But the director of the original movie has suggested it will only be the start of a whole new franchise.
Ivan Reitman has told Deadline.com that he wants to "expand the Ghostbusters universe".
According to him, that will include "different films, TV shows, merchandise... all things that are part of modern filmed entertainment".
Nothing is confirmed but Channing Tatum is one of the names rumoured to be up for a role.
Paul Feig's Ghostbusters reboot is due out in 2016 with Saturday Night Live's Leslie Jones and Kate McKinnon joining Wiig and McCarthy.
Now, Sony Pictures, along with Reitman and original star Dan Aykroyd, are thought to be setting up a Ghost Corps production company which would oversee the output.
Reitman suggests that the Russo Brothers, who directed Captain America: The Winter Soldier, would direct what would then be a fourth Ghostbusters film.
The writer would be Drew Pearce, who wrote Iron Man 3 and Mission Impossible 5.
Quoted by film website Deadline, Reitman said: "Paul Feig's film will be the first version of that. He's got four of the funniest women in the world, and there will be other surprises to come.
"Drew (Pearce) will start writing and the hope is to be ready for the Russo Brothers' next window next summer to shoot, with the movie coming out the following year. It's just the beginning of what I hope will be a lot of wonderful movies."
If Ghostbusters does go down that route, then it would be similar to the way Marvel has set out a whole schedule of interconnecting films.
