"The result's obviously what we're looking for but the performance secondary is very pleasing.
"The manager, the lads, they wanted to give a performance full of energy, full of life and certainly the first half we got that.
"I think you've seen glimpses today of [Smith]. I've worked with him before, he's a very technically gifted player, he's a goal scorer. The more minutes he gets the better it is for Portsmouth FC."
