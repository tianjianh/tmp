France coach Guy Noves has made four changes for Saturday's Six Nations match with bottom side Italy in Rome.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Full-back Brice Dulin replaces Scott Spedding while Fabien Sanconnie, 22, will make his debut in place of the injured Charles Ollivon.
Sebastien Vahaamahina has a back injury so Julien Le Devedec comes in, while Virimi Vakatawa is back on the wing.
