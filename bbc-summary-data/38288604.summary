Arbroath-based RR Spink & Sons said its hot smoked salmon and hot smoked rainbow trout would be stocked at 30 larger Sainsbury's stores in Scotland.
Until now, the company's products have only been available in high-end food halls and luxury delis.
The company was founded in 1715 and now employs 190 people in Arbroath.
It holds a Royal Warrant as Fishmonger to Her Majesty the Queen.
The firm rears its own rainbow trout at Loch Etive on the west coast near Oban. Its salmon is sourced from Scottish companies.
Sales manager Danny Cairney said: "RR Spink & Sons has over 300 years of experience in crafting smoked fish and we believe in using the highest quality of sustainable Scottish salmon and trout in all our products."
