Manager Robbie Neilson is urging new goalkeeper Viktor Noring to compete with Jack Hamilton for a starting place at Hearts.

The 25-year-old Swede signed a two-year deal at Tynecastle on Friday.
"Jack is the number one just now but Viktor will come in and challenge and try to get that off him," Neilson told BBC Scotland.
"He's a good size and a good age. It's important that goalkeepers are kept on their toes."
Hamilton, 22, played in both legs of Hearts' opening Europa League qualifier against Infonet, with Noring likely to be on the bench for Thursday's second round first leg against Birkirkara of Malta.
Noring, formerly with Malmo and Heerenveen, arrived in Edinburgh for a trial period after a season at Danish side Lyngby BK.
He spent time on loan at Celtic in 2013 but did not feature.
"His career started really well and has fallen away a bit, so this is an opportunity for him to prove himself and move on again," added Neilson.
Noring started Saturday's friendly with Dunfermline, while 20-year-old defender Liam Donnelly, who has been at Fulham since 2014, featured as a trialist.
"I'm happy with what I've got but I'd like to bring in a few more," said Neilson.
"There are two or three positions that I think we need strengthened.
"It's important we get quality and not just quantity. Because of our budget, the ones that come in need to be of a good level."
