James Macmillan attacked father-of-five Mahmoud Hussein in Birmingham before running away, leaving him for dead.
Witnesses saw MacMillan shouting abuse before picking up a coping stone and attacking Mr Hussein.
At an earlier hearing at Birmingham Crown Court, Macmillan, 25, admitted attempted murder.
Detectives told the court he had never shown any remorse for the attack, which happened in December 2014 on Stud Lane in Stechford.
After the hearing, Det Insp Nick Dale said: "Despite his guilty plea, Macmillan has never shown any remorse for his actions.
"We are satisfied with the sentence handed to him, which reflects the viciousness of his unprovoked and violent attack."
Speaking to the BBC in July, Mr Hussein - who was left with brain damage and has no recollection of the incident - said the attack "destroyed" his life.
He said he had brought his family to the UK from Palestine to escape troubles there.
