Martin McGuinness to contest assembly elections in Foyle

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Deputy First Minister, Martin McGuinness, is to contest the forthcoming assembly election in his home constituency of Foyle, the BBC has learned.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Sinn Féin politician will not be standing in Mid Ulster, where he is currently an MLA.
The party believes the move will help it win an extra seat in Foyle.
Mr McGuinness first moved to Mid Ulster in 1997 when he was elected MP for the area.
He won an assembly seat in the same constituency the following year.
In the last Assembly elections, Sinn Féin returned two candidates in Foyle, Martina Anderson and Raymond McCartney, with two and half quotas.
Its overall share of the vote was 1% behind the SDLP which claimed three seats.  The Democratic Unionist Party have one MLA in Foyle.
It is understood Sinn Féin feels the addition of Martin McGuinness could close that gap and secure the party a third seat in Foyle.
Sinn Féin has a track record of moving big players around.
It is no coincidence that he is returning to Foyle in the first election in which the SDLP will be led by their new young leader and Foyle MLA Colum Eastwood.
There has been speculation about there potentially being a seat in Foyle for, if you like, left/non Sinn Féin opposition - whether it is People before Profit or independents.
Martin McGuinness was moved initially from Foyle down to Mid Ulster because he couldn't take out the SDLP's John Hume stronghold.
The party already has two seats in the Foyle constituency held by Maeve McLaughlin and Raymond McCartney.
Mr McGuinness' decision to stand in Foyle now is expected to be rubber-stamped by the party at a selection conference in Derry this weekend.
