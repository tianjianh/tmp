[SN]TITLE[SN]
Berwick Rangers 1-0 Montrose

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Berwick gave themselves extra breathing room at the bottom of Scottish League Two with a win over Montrose.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Both Jordan McGregor and Blair Henderson went close to an early breakthrough but Montrose managed to keep them at bay until half-time.
However, Henderson rose highest to head home Finn Graham's cross for what could be a huge goal for Berwick.
Berwick are now five points clear of bottom side East Stirlingshire and just three points behind Montrose.
