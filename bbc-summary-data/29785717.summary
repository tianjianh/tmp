The world champion, 25, followed up his World Grand Prix win earlier this month with victory in Muelheim.
Van Gerwen also had the satisfaction of hitting a nine-dart finish in his semi-final success over fellow Dutch player Raymond van Barneveld.
Jenkins, from Ledbury, has lost all nine of the major televised finals in which he has appeared.
The 51-year-old, who also reached the UK Open final in March, said: "It's obviously disappointing to lose, but I'm happy with the way I played this weekend and to reach the final.
"I suppose it's the same old story with losing the final, but to reach another major final is a feather in my cap. A lot of top players have never made one major final, let alone nine, so I can't be too disappointed."
After averaging 111 in his quarter-final win against Dave Chisnall, Van Gerwen was struggling to find top form against Van Barneveld before hitting a nine-darter in the seventh leg of his last-four tie.
And after coming through that match 11-6, he eased to victory over Jenkins to claim the Â£55,000 first prize.
"It's a fantastic trophy to win and a very special moment for me," said Van Gerwen.
"I'm really happy with how I played throughout the tournament, and the nine-darter was special."
