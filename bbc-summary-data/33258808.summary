[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The threat of a UK national rail strike has been averted after Network Rail agreed a two-year pay deal with unions.

Members of the RMT, TSSA and Unite unions have voted to accept the offer.
The deal includes a 2% pay rise this year and a pay increase in line with RPI inflation next year. There is also an assurance of no compulsory redundancies to the end of next year.
Union members had threatened industrial action this month, but it was called off after a revised offer was made.
Mark Carne, Network Rail chief executive, said it had been "a difficult period of uncertainty for our employees and for the people and businesses that depend on us".
"What has been clear to me throughout these negotiations is the passion we all share for the railway.
"I'm confident we will all now move forward together, translating that passion into improvements that will drive up our performance and deliver a better service for our customers."
Rail, Maritime and Transport union (RMT) members voted to accept the deal by 7,449 votes to 1,598.
RMT general secretary Mick Cash said: "It just goes to show what can be achieved when members stand united and are prepared to fight for decent pay and conditions."
