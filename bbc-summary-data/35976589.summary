Passers-by helped her outside the Brigg Street store and she was treated by paramedics before being taken to Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital.
It is not yet known what caused the sign to fall.
A Clarks spokeswoman confirmed the store was open to the public and was undergoing renovation work.
"Clarks can confirm that an accident occurred outside our Norwich store, causing injury to a member of the public," she said.
She added that the company was investigating the cause and ensuring the "ongoing work does not pose a further risk".
"We offer our deepest apologies to the injured party and will be in contact with them over the coming days," she said.
