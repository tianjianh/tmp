The event will be held at the city's Â£125m Hydro Arena, which opened in October, and has a capacity of 13,000.
Bruce Gillmer, from Viacom International Media Network (VIMN), confirmed the ceremony would be held in Glasgow for the first time.
It follows discussions between MTV, Glasgow City Marketing Bureau and EventScotland.
The MTV EMA was held in Edinburgh in 2003.
This year's event is taking place in Amsterdam on Sunday, and will include performances by Miley Cyrus, Robin Thicke, Katy Perry,  Snoop Dog and Kings of Leon.
Mr Gillmer, executive vice president of talent, music programming and events for VIMN, said: "Each year, the MTV EMA is an amazing, multi-platform music experience for our audiences around the world, presented through a dynamic, talent-driven spectacle that only MTV can deliver.
"As one of the world's great music cities, Glasgow is always a favourite with artists and the new SSE Hydro will provide the perfect backdrop for the MTV EMA in its 20th anniversary year. We're thrilled that the eyes of the music world will be on Glasgow next year."
Councillor Gordon Matheson, leader of Glasgow City Council and chairman of Glasgow City Marketing Bureau, said: "It has been our ambition as part of Glasgow's major events strategy to attract the MTV EMA for a number of years and I'm delighted that MTV has accepted the city's invitation.
"Glasgow proved to be the ideal destination for MTV Crashes in 2010, when Diddy Dirty Money and a fantastic crowd showed MTV's global audience that Glasgow is a city that knows how to party.
"Since then, we've been working to bring the world's greatest music event to Glasgow and I'm delighted we can today announce the next chapter in this exciting partnership.
"Hosting an event of the magnitude and international reach of the MTV EMA reinforces Glasgow's enviable reputation as one of the world's leading music cities."
Culture Secretary Fiona Hyslop said: "2014 is going to be an incredible year for Scotland and it is fantastic news that the MTV EMA will be coming to Glasgow.
"As a signature event on the Homecoming Scotland 2014 programme, we will welcome the world to the EMA and showcase Glasgow and Scotland to nearly 700 million households through MTV's global network of channels.
"The awards are a highlight on the global music calendar and next year it is fitting that it should be held in Scotland, the perfect stage for events, in Glasgow's newest venue, the spectacular SSE Hydro."
