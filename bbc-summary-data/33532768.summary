Driver sought after Dunnington lay-by rape

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Police investigating the night-time rape of a vulnerable woman have issued a description of a lorry driver they want to speak to.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The woman, in her 40s, was asleep in her car in a lay-by at Dunnington, near York, when she was attacked.
North Yorkshire Police said the woman was attacked on 1 July, but they have only now obtained a description.
The driver is about 55 years old, 5ft 10in tall with blonde or light hair and a tattoo on his upper left arm.
His lorry was cream or white in colour, with red lettering on the side including the letters D and E.
Det Ch Insp Dave Ellis, of North Yorkshire Police, said: "I believe that fellow drivers may recognise the description of this man, or of his lorry, and will be able to provide information which will help to identify him."
