Five holidaymakers have been airlifted from a Cornish beach after being cut-off by the tide.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The three women and two men were stranded in a cove between Tolcarne and Lusty Glaze, Newquay on Saturday.
Sea conditions meant they could not be rescued by lifeboat and were winched to safety from rocks by a rescue helicopter from RNAS Culdrose.
The group was not injured but rescue teams have urged beach users to check the tide times.
A spokesman from Falmouth Coastguard said there was some confusion when they received the initial call as the tourists did not know exactly where they were.
Two lifeboats were launched at about 16:10 BST and a member of the RNLI "comforted" the group who were "cut off by an incoming spring tide with no way out", said Gareth Horner, from Newquay RNLI.
The group was later winched from rocks to safety and returned to their holiday accommodation.
Mr Horner urged people to check the tide times and only swim at beaches with lifeguards in attendance.
