The Prince of Wales has arrived in Jordan's capital Amman at the start of a six-day tour of the Middle East.

Prince Charles was greeted by a small entourage including Jordanian King Abdullah II's religious adviser, Prince Ghazi Bin Muhammad.
The prince will hold bilateral talks with King Abdullah on Sunday.
The country is still reeling from the murder of 26-year-old Jordanian air force pilot Moaz al Kasasbeh by Islamic State (IS) last week.
King Abdullah has vowed to wage a "harsh" war against IS, and fighter jets from Jordan have carried out fresh attacks on the militants, who control parts of neighbouring Syria and Iraq.
Following his arrival, Prince Charles met Christian refugees from Iraq at the British ambassador's residence in Amman.
Remarking on the rise of IS, Charles told them: "This is what I think must be the worst of horrors - when all the people you lived with, side by side, and have always been friendly [with], suddenly totally change."
He has previously raised the plight of Orthodox Christians who have been forced to flee Iraq and Syria because of IS, seeking refuge in the UK.
Prince Charles will express Britain's sympathy and solidarity with Jordan in the fight against IS when he meets the king.
BBC royal correspondent Nicholas Witchell says Jordan would like something rather more definitive, such as more support for the training of its armed forces and more cash to deal with refugees.
Prince Charles knew King Abdullah's father well, and the king trained at the Royal Military Academy, Sandhurst, and served in the British army.
The prince will be joined in Jordan by the UK's International Development Secretary Justine Greening.
