A £5,000 appeal has been launched to save a tiny 32-seat cinema in Somerset.

The Roxy, housed in a pub in Axbridge, needs help to upgrade or replace sound and projection equipment and carry out major refurbishment works.
A campaign called "Rescue the Roxy" has now been launched with chairperson Juliet Maclay saying the venue is "an open door for the community."
The cinema has been going nine years and is thought to be one of the UK's smallest working cinemas.
Facilities at the venue include an Art Deco box office and a 1950s cocktail bar.
Although primarily a cinema, it has also been used for comedy events, theatre, training and talks.
So far £1,500 has been raised by the campaign which was launched with the support of the Community Council for Somerset (CCS).
Ms Maclay said among its many roles they also hosted "local groups, the brownies, Roxy babies, adults with learning disabilities and mentoring young volunteers who are interested in film."
She added "We want to remain at the heart of our community for many years to come and with the support of CCS and the public I hope we will achieve our goal."
