Felix Alexander, from Worcester, was 17 when he was hit by a train on 27 April last year.
His mother Lucy Alexander has set up The Felix Project, launched at Pershore High School on Monday.
The programme aims to help teachers spot the signs of a child being victimised and to train pupils to give peer support.

It is being run by the children's charity Place2Be.
Ms Alexander said: "I carry huge guilt that I did not say more when he was still alive and I feel compelled to give him a voice now."
Advice she gave out to the Pershore pupils included some words on banter, saying it is only funny if people are secure in their friendships.
Pershore High head teacher Clive Corbett backed the scheme, which Ms Alexander hopes will become embedded in the school curriculum.
"We will train pupils to be what we call a peer mentor, and also staff from this school and other schools to make sure we are providing training for them," he said.
"However well we feel we might do, we clearly can do things better."
Speaking after the event, a couple of the pupils said Ms Alexander was "inspirational".
She previously said her son was subjected to "cruel and overwhelming" taunts on social media, which eventually became unbearable.
An inquest heard he made friends at Pershore High School, where the staff described him as bright and kind, after facing difficulties at his previous school.
