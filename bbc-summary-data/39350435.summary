A device exploded while officers were on patrol on Tuesday night, police said.
Parts of the town have been cordoned off as a result of the security alert, and there is no access to the town via Liskey Road.
The explosion reportedly happened at about 20:30 GMT.
"We are incredibly lucky that the lives of officers and other members of the community were not lost last night," said Supt Gordon McCalmont.
"We appreciate the understanding and patience of local residents while we carry out our enquiries and would appeal for anyone with information about suspicious activity in the area to contact us."
SDLP MLA Daniel McCrossan condemned the attack and said the device has been described as "substantial".
"Such attacks on the PSNI have no place in a modern progressive society," he said.
"Strabane has come a long way over recent years and the people want no return of the past."
Earlier, Sinn FÃ©in councillor Karina Carlin said she heard a bang when the device exploded.
"I went to the scene after the noise but I didn't see anything," she said.
"The police were trying to get residents out of their homes last night, but I urged them not to because there wasn't going to be any meaningful searching until this morning."
