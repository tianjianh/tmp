The shootings happened at a farm in Daventry, Northamptonshire, on Thursday and at a farm in Leamington Spa, Warwickshire, on Friday.
Farmers are within their rights to shoot dogs worrying sheep on their land, Warwickshire Police said.
PC Mike Barnett said the lambing season was just beginning and urged dog owners to keep their pets on leads.

PC Barnett, dog legislation officer for the Warwickshire force, said: "To lose sheep and unborn lambs has a big effect on farmers' livelihoods.
"To lose a loved pet causes huge upset for dog owners too.
"All it takes to avoid this distress is to keep dogs on leads and make sure they cannot get out and run loose."
It comes after two dogs were shot on a farm in Alcester Road South, Birmingham, on 5 January.
One of those two dogs died and the other was injured.
