Richard Cole: Theft arrest in Dutch canal victim probe

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Dutch police have arrested a man on suspicion of stealing the wallet of a British man whose body was found in a canal in Amsterdam.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Richard Cole, 30, from Dursley in Gloucestershire, went missing during a night out in the Thorbeckeplein area of the city on 25 January.
His body was recovered from the water a week later.
Detectives investigating his death arrested a 23 year old man and have taken him into custody for questioning.
Police previously said "a number of men" were suspected of robbing Mr Cole, who was "very drunk and therefore an easy target".
But they were not thought to have been directly involved in his death, they added.
An inquest into Mr Cole's death was opened at Gloucestershire Coroner's Court earlier and adjourned until 30 June.
