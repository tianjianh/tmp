Enninful, who has previously worked for Italian and American Vogue, will take over from Alexandra Shulman, who announced her departure in January.
Condé Nast International's Jonathan Newhouse said Enninful was "an influential figure in the communities of fashion, Hollywood and music".
He is currently the fashion and creative director at W Magazine, where he has worked since 2011.
The 45-year-old will start his new role on 1 August.
After the news was announced, designer Marc Jacobs tweeted: "Congratulations to our longtime friend @Edward_Enninful, the new editor of British Vogue! We can't wait to see what you do! ❤️"
Caroline Rush, chief executive of the British Fashion Council, told the BBC: "Anything that promotes diversity and gender equality in the industry is incredibly important, but there's no doubt that Edward's been appointed because of his talent."
"He brings a very distinct point of view in terms of the imagery that he has been associated with, and I think that's going to be really exciting to see how that is translated into the pages of Vogue."
