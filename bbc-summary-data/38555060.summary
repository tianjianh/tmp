[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man who hit his university lecturer wife in the head with a hammer as she slept has been found guilty of attempting to murder her.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Paul Bond, 62, attacked Dr Marian Bond at their home in Over, Cambridgeshire, on 11 July. He then called 999 to say he had attacked his wife.
Police arrived to find him covered in her blood. Surgeons had to remove part of her skull to save her life.
Bond denied attempted murder but was found guilty at Cambridge Crown Court.
Bond struck his wife, head of the animal behaviour and welfare department at Anglia Ruskin University, at least twice with a 2.5lb (1kg) lump hammer severely fracturing her skull and jaw, Cambridgeshire Police said.

He then called the emergency services. Officers found him at the couple's Willingham Road home with blood on his hands, cheek, chest and dressing gown.
Dr Bond's injuries were so severe lead investigator Det Insp Jerry Waite said they would "probably have been dealing with a murder" had it not been for the quick intervention of paramedics.
"This was a horrific assault which could easily have killed Dr Bond," he added.
Dr Bond was placed in an induced coma in hospital and part of her skull was removed.  She has since made a partial recovery, Cambridgeshire Police said.
Bond pleaded guilty in November to intending to cause grievous bodily harm but denied attempting to murder her.
He is expected to be sentenced on Tuesday.
