Will Anderson, who is from the Black Isle, is part of a team working on a project that will combine live contemporary music with animated film.
Also involved are musicians including Portishead's Adrian Utley and Dominic Aitchison from Mogwai.
Mr Anderson and fellow film-maker Ainslie Henderson won a Scottish Bafta last year.
The duo secured the award with their short film Monkey Love Experiments. It tells of a monkey that mistakenly believes that it is to be sent to the Moon.
Mr Anderson, a former pupil of Dingwall Academy and an Edinburgh College of Art graduate, said described the new project, Flit, as a "musical theatre show".
Other musicians involved include Karine Polwart and Martin Green from the band Lau.
Mr Anderson said: "We've written the story with Martin and his band are going to play this gig and we are going to make the theatre and visual side of it.
"It's quite a dark story that we are telling that's slightly set in another land and its kind of fantastical.
"We are quite excited about having something we can share that is as beautiful as their music."
