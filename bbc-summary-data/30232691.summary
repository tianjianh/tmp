Brandao: Laurent Blanc says jail term 'disproportionate'

Paris St-Germain manager Laurent Blanc says the one-month jail term imposed on Bastia striker Brandao for headbutting PSG midfielder Thiago Motta is "disproportionate".

The Brazilian, 34, had already received a six-month ban for the incident in PSG's 2-0 home win on 16 August.
Motta, 32, was left with a broken nose in the attack by Brandao, who also received a £15,850 (20,000 Euros) fine.
"I find it excessive," Blanc said at a news conference.
Brandao's lawyer expects the player to serve the punishment through community service and not in jail.
"He's not actually going to serve a month in prison but do something for the community," added Blanc before asking journalists to "move on to something else".
Brandao, a league winner with Marseille in 2010, says Motta insulted him during the game.
After being substituted he appeared to wait for the Italy international in a dressing room corridor, which was captured on CCTV.
"On the pitch Brandao said he'd be waiting for me afterwards, but I never thought he'd actually do it," Motta told the police.
Prosecutors had called for an eight-month suspended sentence and a £11,888 (15,000) euros fine.
PSG president Nasser Al-Khelaifi said Brandao "should be suspended for life" after the incident.
