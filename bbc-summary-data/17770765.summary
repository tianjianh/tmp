OFT warns over 'misleading' business names

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A regulator has warned the firms it licences to avoid using "misleading or undesirable" trading names.

The Office of Fair Trading (OFT) can stop customers being misled by the use of words like 'helpline'.
It is particularly worried about firms selling loans or debt advice that imply they are charities or government agencies.
The warning is part of the OFT's continuing campaign against misleading debt advisers.
However, most questionable names were changed following informal discussions between the business and the regulator, an OFT spokesman said.
On rare occasions, the OFT has formally refused an application to vary a licence by a firm wishing to use a misleading name.
The regulator said that it wanted to prevent names being used by commercial firms that could mislead people looking for free, impartial, charitable or public sector assistance.
It also wanted firms to avoid misleading customers about the services on offer, the cost of these services, the geographic scope of the business or the relationship with other businesses.
That means business names such as Cheap Loans For All would be challenged, as would claims of no interest, or lowest prices in a trading name.
In December 2010, the OFT refused an application from Baker Evans Limited to use the trading names The Bankruptcy Helpline and The Insolvency Helpline.
In October 2011, the OFT also stopped Money Advice Direct Limited using its former existing trading name, the UK Insolvency Helpline, and proposed domain names including the word "helpline".
The OFT warning adds to the threat it made last year to 129 debt management firms to change the way they carried out their business.
Adam Scorer, of watchdog Consumer Focus, said: "This is a sensible tightening of a loophole that seems to be deliberately exploited by unscrupulous traders.
"Companies trading to make a profit should not be able to mislead consumers by calling themselves a 'helpline' or any similar title. This is a common sense move which will help reassure consumers."
The Money Advice Trust, which runs the National Debtline service, said people searching for it on the internet were at risk of being misled by copycat adverts from commercial firms.
"Anyone who enters the name of our free, charity service, 'National Debtline' into Google today will see adverts from fee-charging companies that are clearly trying to give the false impression that their website is National Debtline's website," said Joanna Elson, the chief executive of the Money Advice Trust.
"It can take a fair amount of courage to own up to a debt problem and seek help, so when someone does take the right step, they deserve better than firms trying to make a profit by deliberately misleading them," she added.
