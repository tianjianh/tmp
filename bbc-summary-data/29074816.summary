Samuel Carson, 91, died after a fire in the garage of neighbour's house at Thorndale Park caused his home to go up in flames on Tuesday.
Police are now treating it as suspected arson as a result of new information.
The 57-year-old woman has been released pending a report to the Public Prosecution Service (PPS).
On Tuesday, firefighters responded to a call of an oil tank on fire at Mr Carson's neighbour's house at about 01:00 BST.
They brought the pensioner out of his home on the nearby Hillsborough Road, but he died at the scene.
