Mian Zeeshan Shahid, 32, from Kenley, south London, was convicted of taking a deer and causing it unnecessary suffering.
He had boasted of the killing on a Facebook group called 'Deer Stalkers International'.
Members of the group forwarded the post to the Metropolitan Police.
In December, he took the roe deer from a field in Mitchley Avenue, South Croydon, and drove it to his home.
He then killed the animal by cutting its throat.
Later that day, Shahid posted an update on a Facebook group devoted to legal deer-stalking, boasting of killing a deer and making "a good meal for 10".
His hunting gear and air weapons were seized.
Shahid pleaded guilty to both counts of taking a deer and causing it unnecessary suffering and received sentences of four and three months to run concurrently, suspended for two years.
He was also ordered to undertake 200 hours of unpaid work.
Croydon Wildlife Crime officer Ian Reeve said the deer had died "a prolonged, painful and unnecessary death".
"Ultimately, his boasting on the internet and reports from eagle-eyed members of the public helped us to catch him and bring him before a court," he said.
