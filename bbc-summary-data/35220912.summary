The incident happened on 30 December on the B712 road at Stobo, near Peebles.
A Volkswagen Polo became stuck in 4ft of water and police, ambulance, fire service and mountain rescue personnel were all involved in freeing a woman from the car.
Local police have repeated their call for drivers to observe road closures.
Insp John Scott said: "This is the second incident in December of someone being charged for ignoring road closure signs in the Borders.
"Ignoring these not only risks your own safety, but that of emergency services personnel who will be required to rescue you. It also prevents these vital resources from being able to help other people.
"Please remember that road closures are always in place for a reason. There are no excuses for ignoring these and if you fail to comply, you will be charged."
