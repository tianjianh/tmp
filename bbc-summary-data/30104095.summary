Sex, swearing and threats: Why Paddington is a PG

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The trailer starts by charting Paddington's journey from the treetops of the Peruvian jungle to the bright lights of London.

Lost and homeless, in a city he doesn't know, you'd forgive him for cursing his luck from time to time.
But Paddington is the politest of bears and would surely never say anything bad, right?
However, the family adventure about a talking bear has been awarded a PG certificate instead of a U. Here's why:
Okay, this is putting it a bit strongly, but the British Board of Film Classification (BBFC) has said that there is some "mild innuendo" in the film.
Enough to warrant an appearance on Scott Mills's Innuendo Bingo? Probably not.
But there's one sequence highlighted by the BBFC where "a man disguised as a woman is flirted with by another man."
Let's be honest unless you're a Paddington superfan, have children or have a teddy bear obsession, you're probably not going to go and see this film.
It's primarily been made for kids - and it follows that kids copy things they see on the big screen.
So what are the BBFC trying to stop these impressionable young viewers from doing?
Well, there's one scene where "Paddington (is) hiding from a villain inside a refrigerator."
But turning Paddington from a chilly bear in to a polar bear isn't the board's only concern.
Our loveable hero is also seen "riding on a skateboard while holding onto a bus, as well as a brief scene of a boy strapping fireworks to his shoes."
Who would possibly want to hurt a cute, cuddly bear like Paddington? Nicole Kidman, that's who.
The Australian actress plays the film's villain and she's out to "kill and stuff" Paddington.
And (spoiler alert), she comes close too. Viewers will see our pawed protagonist spread unconscious on a table, while an evil taxidermist prepares tools nearby.
But it's not just in London that Paddington needs to keep his wits about him.
"There is also a short scene in a jungle when Paddington and his family run for shelter during an earthquake with trees falling around them," according to the BBFC.
On the whole Paddington is as sweet as the marmalade he devours.
His manners are immaculate, barring the odd dining table faux pas, but there is one solitary "mumbled use of 'bloody'" which is enough to cause concern for the BBFC.
Contrary to other reports, the BBFC has told Newsbeat that Paddington was always classified as a PG film and has not been upgraded from a "U" certificate.
The board defended its decision and said its guidelines are reviewed every four to five years.
"The most recent review of the guidelines, in 2013, involved more than 10,000 member of the public from across the UK.
"The 2013 review found that 92% of film viewers agreed with the classification of films and videos they had seen recently."
