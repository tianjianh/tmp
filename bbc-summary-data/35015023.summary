About 30 anti-war campaigners held the demonstration outside a constituency surgery in Beeston held by the shadow foreign secretary.
Last week, Mr Benn was applauded by MPs during the Commons vote on airstrikes after urging them to "confront the evil" of so-called Islamic State (IS).
He was one of 66 Labour MPs who voted in favour of military action.
The motion was carried by 397 votes to 223 and the RAF has since carried out raids on Syria.
One of the Leeds Coalition Against the War protesters accused Mr Benn of "hypocrisy" in his parliamentary speech supporting bombing.
"I am a constituent of Hilary Benn and I completely disagree with what he's doing," he said.
"I think if Hilary Benn is not willing to listen to his constituents then we should move towards deselection and put pressure on the Labour Party and go about it that way."
Mr Benn talked to the protesters and defended his vote in favour of air strikes saying "he was standing up for what he believed in".
Speaking to the BBC after the demonstration Mr Benn said he had a "spirited discussion" with the protesters.
"We are a democracy," he said.
"The people who are living under Daesh have no opportunity, they despise democracy."
"And I think we have a responsibility and that's the argument I made, to stand up for people who are being oppressed and to try and assist and that's what the vote in parliament was all about."
