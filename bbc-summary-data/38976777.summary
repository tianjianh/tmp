The 30-year-old joined the Exiles as a free agent following his departure from League of Ireland side Shamrock Rovers.
Blanchard, who was Newport's 14th signing of 2017, played the full 90 minutes as they drew with League Two leaders Doncaster on Friday.
Exiles manager Graham Westley said: "Max was [playing] game-to-game. He's moved on and we wish him well."
