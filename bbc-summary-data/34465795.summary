Aberystwyth bank 'bans' harpist over Welsh language sign row

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An international harpist from Ceredigion claims he was banned from a bank after complaining about a sign.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Robin Huw Bowen said he was told to leave HSBC in Aberystwyth town centre after protesting about the small Welsh language lettering on a welcome sign.
The bank said it asked Mr Bowen to leave because his behaviour "became too disruptive" but added his comments would be "fully considered".
The Welsh Language Commissioner called the situation "totally unacceptable".
Speaking on Radio Cymru's Taro'r Post, Mr Bowen said he was unhappy the Welsh lettering was smaller than those in English, arguing it was treating Welsh "as a second class language".
He complained to the bank on three occasions but said he was asked to leave by the manager on the fourth.
In a statement, the bank said: "We work hard to provide Welsh language services and have a close relationship with the Welsh Language Commissioner to help inform how we best communicate with our customers.
"We have shared Mr Bowen's concern about our welcome sign with our own Welsh language team as we take feedback seriously and will make sure it is fully considered.
"We are sorry Mr Bowen found the sign upsetting but due to his behaviour we had to ask him to leave our branch as it became too disruptive for our customers. We did not take this decision lightly and it is always the last resort."
