Years and Years, George The Poet and James Bay are being tipped for starring roles on the music scene next year.
The winner, who will be chosen by DJs, journalists and music industry experts, will be announced on Thursday 4 December.
Previous recipients include Tom Odell and Emeli SandÃ©.
George the Poet
After wowing crowds on the spoken word circuit, the north London-based performer has proved his music credentials too.
George has appeared on tracks by Labrinth, Emeli SandÃ© and Paolo Nutini.
"To be a Brit nominee feels like I'm achieving my aim and I'm reaching people, " he told Newsbeat.
"When I found out the news, I was driving and I just had to keep my eyes on the road because I was over excited."
The 23-year-old will feature on Idris Elba's forthcoming album, Mi Mandela. The project was inspired by former South African President Nelson Mandela who died a year ago.
George is the first spoken word artist to be nominated for the award.
"It feels sick man, its all about changing the barriers and pushing onto new horizons," he said.
Analysis
Sinean Garvan, Newsbeat Music Journalist
The Critics' Choice category was introduced in 2008 and is one of many awards predicting who will be big in the coming year.
There is also the BBC's Sound of 2015 and MTV's Brand New for 2015, among others.
It will be a bit of a surprise if most of the same names don't appear on each of these lists.
Critics in the music press argue it is a self-fulfilling prophesy where industry people all agree on who will be big and are too scared to back someone different for fear of looking like they don't know what they are talking about.
However, you can't argue with the cold hard facts.
Sam Smith won the Sound of 2014 and was the Brits Critics Choice winner and he has become a global superstar within a year and there's also Adele, Jessie J and Ellie Goulding.
Getting on to one or all of these lists can be a big part of a new artists campaign but much like the X Factor you don't have to win it to become a success.
FKA Twigs, Royal Blood and Nick Mulvey all failed to make the top five of the Sound of 2014, yet all three were nominated for the Mercury Prize.
The London electro-pop trio are due to release their debut album next year.
They've spent most of 2014 on tour supporting the likes of Clean Bandit and Sam Smith.
Singer Olly Alexander said he thought it was a joke when the band's manager told them about the nomination.
"It was quite emotional," he said.
He joked: "I still feel a bit like maybe it was a mistake. Like what if it was meant for Tears for Fears, not us?
"Of course there's a lot of pressure but the album's nearly done and I'm so happy with the kind of stuff we've been doing."
James Bay is a singer-songwriter and guitarist from Hitchin, Hertfordshire.
The last 18 months have seen the 24-year-old support Hozier, Tom Odell and John Newman on tour.
He told Newsbeat: "I was a little bit lost for words when I heard [about the nomination] to be honest. It was an amazing moment.
"It feels like things are paying off a lot. It's a massive, massive honour."
James' debut album will be released next year.
"The last year's been amazing. The biggest thing for me has been the reaction I got from fans and experiencing actually having fans and growing a fan base.
"It's been a pretty big ride," he added.
Watch James Bay in Session with Radio 1's Zane Lowe.
The Critics' Choice category was introduced in 2008.
The Brit Awards 2015 will presented by Ant & Dec on 25 February at the O2 Arena in London.
