The 19-year-old made his first-team debut for Spurs in a 2-1 loss at Liverpool in the EFL Cup in October.
"We played against Spurs in pre-season and Shayon played very well and caught the eye," said Glovers boss Darren Way.
"We know Tottenham have an unbelievable desire and work ethic - attributes needed to play for Yeovil Town."
Way previously signed West Bromwich Albion striker Andre Wright on loan, but the deal had to be cancelled as he had already played for two clubs this term.
