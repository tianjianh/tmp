Lee Selby is eyeing an Anglo-Welsh world title fight against Josh Warrington before the first defence of his IBF featherweight title against Fernando Montiel on Wednesday.

Welshman Selby will make his United States debut against the Mexican veteran in Glendale, Arizona.
"I want to be a worldwide star and to do that you need the big fights in America," said the 28-year-old.
"But Warrington is still a fight I'd be interested in, the UK fans want it."
Leeds' Warrington is unbeaten in 22 professional fights and is the European and Commonwealth featherweight title-holder.
Selby, who has lost just once in his 22 professional bouts, became world champion in London in May when he outclassed Russian Evgeny Gradovich.
He had been expected to make the first defence of his title in Wales, but his decision to link with up Floyd Mayweather's adviser, Al Haymon, has seen him try to make his name across the Atlantic.
"Fighting in Las Vegas is the dream for any boxer and I want to do that," said Selby.
"But I'd fancy fighting Warrington in Leeds. I was up there at one of his fights working for Sky and they were throwing pints of beer at me and calling me all sorts of stuff.
"I'd love to go up there and knock him out in front of them all.
"I also think it would be an easy fight when you look at people like [WBA champion] Leo Santa Cruz and [WBO champion] Vasyl Lomachenko in the featherweight division."
Montiel, 36, has had 60 pro fights, is a former world champion at flyweight, super-flyweight and bantamweight and his last defeat came four years ago.
