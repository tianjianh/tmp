A complex containing a multi-screen cinema and restaurants is set to be built on a former hospital site which has been derelict for 10 years.

Loughborough General Hospital on Baxter Gate, which closed in 2003, was demolished last year.
Developer Citygrove said it hoped to finish construction in 2015 and create about 180 jobs.
Charnwood Borough Council said the new development "fits in with the town centre's master plan very well".
Councillor David Slater, leader of the council, said: "That part of town has been run down ever since the NHS departed from the old hospital.
"The building was knocked down and there was a big gap there and the traders on Baxter Gate aren't getting many people walking up there."
Les Cope-Newman, from Loughborough's Business Improvement District, said: "The site has been empty and long overdue for development.
"It's going to be a massive improvement to that side of town and Baxter Gate as well."
