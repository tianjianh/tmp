[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The number of motorcyclists killed on London's roads reached 36 in 2015, Transport for London (TfL) data showed.

In 2014, 27 motorcyclists were killed and the number of serious injuries also rose from 507 to 514 in the year up to September 2015.
London Assembly's Transport Committee said the figure for deaths was "unacceptably high".
TfL said more police have been deployed in accident hotspots and it is focusing on motorcycle and scooter safety.
The figures were released as the London Assembly committee published its report â€˜Easy Rider: Improving motorcycle safety on London roadsâ€™.
Researchers spoke to 1,200 riders and found one in five had been involved in a collision and about 62% motorcyclists had been involved in a near-miss incident.
In 2010, 4,337 motorcyclists were injured in London, which by 2014 rose to 5,233, an increase of nearly 21%.
The report found the inconsistency over access to bus lanes causes "unnecessary confusion" as TfL allows motorcyclists to ride in bus lanes on the roads it manages, while many boroughs do not.
It also asked TfL to monitor the impact of dedicated Cycle Superhighways on the road space shared by other traffic.
The report also called on authorities to educate young riders.
Valerie Shawcross, chair of the London Assembly Transport Committee, said: "Arguably motorcyclists have been overlooked in public discussion about road safety in recent years.
"However, 36 motorcyclists were killed on London's roads last year, a death toll that is unacceptably high, and part of a bigger picture of collisions and injuries affecting motorcyclists, many of them life-changing in their seriousness."
TfL said that since September police had stopped 5,389 riders, issued 742 traffic offence reports, 1,335 verbal warnings, seized 96 motorcycles and made 10 arrests.
Police will also target the boroughs where motorcyclists are at greatest risk of injury.
Leon Daniels, TfL's managing director of surface transport, said: "On-street education and enforcement, substantial investment in improving rider skills and guidance to help engineers design roads so that they are safer for riders, all form part of a concerted effort to improve road safety in the capital."
