[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Barnet produced a physically dominant display against Accrington Stanley to grab their first victory of the season.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The sides struggled in possession early on and Michael Nelson's 24th-minute blocked header for Barnet was the first shot on target.
Five minutes later, Bees forward Alex Nicholls almost doubled his tally for the season with a 20-yard volley that slid just past the post.
But John Akinde's cool 33rd-minute finish gave Barnet the lead after he latched onto a long ball from Elliot Johnson.
And Akinde nearly laid on a second straight after half-time, bursting through from halfway and squaring to Curtis Weston, but his placed shot from the edge of the box drifted wide.
It was indeed 2-0 in the 60th minute when substitute Jean-Louis Akpa Akpro scored from 20 yards just three minutes after coming on.
Stanley's Sean McConville drew a terrific save from Josh Vickers during the seven minutes of stoppage time, but Barnet closed out an impressive win.
