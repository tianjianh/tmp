He's thought to have broken the World Record for the greatest top speed flown in a wingsuit.
He used special kit to help him breathe and complete the jump safely.
You can find out more about Fraser here.
Fraser reached a speed of 249mph - this means he's the fastest man in the world without the use of machinery.
He's now waiting for his record to be made official.
Just watch him go!
