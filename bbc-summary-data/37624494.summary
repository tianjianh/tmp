[SN]TITLE[SN]
Border funding after Brexit 'under consideration'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The secretary of state has said the government is giving consideration to future funding for Northern Ireland's border regions after it leaves the EU.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
James Brokenshire was appearing in front of a Lords Select Committee.
He was asked if the government accepted that EU funding has provided a "positive transformational effect" on border regions.
He was also asked how the government would assess the impact of the loss of that funding after leaving the EU.
The secretary of state reiterated pledges previously made by the chancellor to stand by commitments to EU peace and cross border projects in the period 2014 - 2020, which he estimated at around 469m euros  (Â£427m).
Looking to the future, Mr Brokenshire said the government was considering the position carefully, but had formed no guarantees so far.
He talked about "a number of different funding lines and programmes" after the UK's departure. However he stressed the Treasury's work in this area was "very much analysis and work in progress".
Asked to guarantee the existing rights of Irish citizens living in the UK, Mr Brokenshire said the government would stand by the Good Friday Agreement and pointed to the Ireland Act 1949 which says Irish citizens should not be treated as foreigners.
He said there was no reason to suppose the UK's exit from the EU would effect those obligations and that is "very much the approach we are taking".
