[SN]TITLE[SN]
Portugal appoint Fernando Santos as new manager

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Fernando Santos has been appointed as the new manager of the Portuguese national side.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 59-year-old could start his new job with an eight-match ban after he was sent off in his final game as Greece boss - a 5-3 penalty shoot-out defeat by Costa Rica at the 2014 World Cup.
Lisbon-born Santos, who has managed Benfica, has appealed against the ban.
He succeeds Paulo Bento, who quit after a surprise 1-0 Euro 2016 qualifying loss to Albania earlier this month.
Santos, who played for Maritimo and Estoril during the 1970s, has also been in charge of Porto and Sporting Lisbon during his 27-year managerial career.
He has also spent time managing in Greece, including a stint with PAOK, Panathinaikos and two spells with AEK Athens.
He was in charge of Greece for four years but his reign ended on a sour note with his sending off, which followed an altercation with an official at the end of the last-16 match in Recife.
