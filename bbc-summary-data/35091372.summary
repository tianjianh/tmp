A 24-year-old woman who died after the motorboat she was in capsized on the Thames has been named as Charlotte Sophie Brown.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Ms Brown and a 29-year-old man were recovered from the water after police heard shouts near Wandsworth Bridge at 23:45 GMT on Tuesday.
The pair were taken to hospital where Ms Brown died. A boat was later recovered from the water at the scene.
Ms Brown lived in East Finchley but was originally from Welling in Bexley.
A post-mortem examination at St George's Hospital on Friday failed to establish a cause of death and the coroner ordered further tests. An inquest will open on Tuesday.
