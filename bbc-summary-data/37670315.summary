The girl may have had access to "ecstasy type tablets" at the party in Newtongrange, Police Scotland said.
She died at Edinburgh Royal Infirmary after falling ill on Saturday.
The force said the warning related to "red bugatti veyron and purple ninja turtle" tablets and "strongly urged" people not to take them.
"Inquiries into the circumstances surrounding [the girl's] death are at a very early stage, however one line of inquiry officers are following is that she may have had access to ecstasy type tablets," it said in a statement.
"Anyone who has taken these tablets is urged to seek immediate medical attention.
"Police Scotland's message is clear. There is no safe illegal drug and no safe way to take illegal drugs."
