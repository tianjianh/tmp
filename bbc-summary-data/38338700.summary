[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Gonzalo Higuain's superb first-half strike ensured a record-equalling victory for Juventus that extends their lead over Roma at the top of Serie A.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Higuain, 29, lashed home from 18 yards to secure Juve's 25th-straight home league win - matching a record they set between August 2013 and November 2014.
Juve now lead Roma by seven points after 17 games, to stay on course for a sixth-straight Serie A title triumph.
Roma have now lost on their past six league visits to Juventus.
The Argentina forward's 10th league goal of the season, and third in two games, arrived in the 14th minute when he outmuscled Daniele de Rossi and ghosted past Kostas Manolas before hitting an unstoppable strike beyond Wojciech Szczesny.
Also on Saturday, third-placed AC Milan were held to a goalless draw at home to Atalanta, while Empoli pulled five points clear of the relegation zone with a 2-0 win over Cagliari.
