The visitors led when Jordan White scored his first goal of the season.
Liam Nolan equalised when Wrexham failed to clear a corner, before Delial Brewster slotted home before the interval following Nolan's pass.
John Rooney then smashed home a penalty for Wrexham on 66 minutes after Ryan Higgins fouled Gerry McDonough, before Nolan's late stunner settled matters.
Wrexham manager Dean Keates told BBC Radio Wales Sport: "We shot ourselves in the foot three times.
"Possibly a draw would have been fair, but we were not streetwise enough and we didn't weather the storm.
"All being well we will strengthen the squad in January, we need one or two additions this week.
"One player turned us down last week, but all being well, we will get one in this week."
