London Irish assistant coach Clark Laidlaw says the side can "play with freedom" in their must-win Premiership match at Newcastle Falcons on Sunday.

Irish travel to Kingston Park four points adrift of the Falcons at the bottom with three games to play.
Laidlaw said there were positive signs in their 38-30 European Challenge Cup quarter-final defeat at Harlequins.
"We need to play with that freedom at Newcastle and beyond and try to match that performance," he told BBC Sport.
"We're trying to create that environment all the time. It's difficult when you're in the situation we are."

The Exiles, who have won just four Premiership matches all season, will try to break a run of almost 14 months without an away league win at fellow strugglers Newcastle.
A win could lift them off the bottom and above the Falcons.
"We've tried to stay really even as an environment and as a team, not be too up or down around wins or losses," added Laidlaw.
"The players are in a good place. They're tight, they're working hard in training. Nothing's changed throughout the year."
