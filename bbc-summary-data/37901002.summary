[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Scotland's Year of Innovation, Architecture and Design has been marked with an event on the tiny island of Raasay.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Held on Saturday and called Whisky, Fire and Song, it included a tour of the construction site of the isle's first whisky distillery.
There was also a baking competition which invited children to make cakes in the shape of buildings found on Raasay.
About 50 people also took part in a torchlight parade and a bonfire.
The distillery and visitor centre is being built by R&B Distillers at the site of Borodale House, a derelict Victorian hotel.
The production of the first whisky at the site could begin in April next year.
The distillery would be one of the largest employers on an island with a population of about 120 people. Raasay lies off the Isle of Skye.
R&B stands for Raasay and Borders. Co-founder Alasdair Day's great grandfather, Allan MacDonald, was from the Hebrides while his other great grandfather, Richard Day, was a master-blender in the Borders in the early 19th Century.
The company secured planning permission for the project from Highland Council in February this year.
