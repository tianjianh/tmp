Scottish Labour leader Jim Murphy has pledged to invest £1bn in Scotland's "young working-class" during a speech in the City of London.

The package will be partly funded by UK Labour's plans to reintroduce a tax on bankers' bonuses.
Labour says about 5,000 Scots aged 18-24 will be eligible for a new Jobs Guarantee scheme in its first year.
The SNP said Scotland's young people "won't fall for his empty attempts to buy their vote".
Mr Murphy told an audience: "This is an unprecedented investment in our young people.
"We will use a new tax on the bonuses of bankers here in the City of London and in the UK's other financial centres.
"We will use that funding to guarantee a real job, at at-least minimum wage, and to guarantee training for every young person too."
SNP work and pensions spokeswoman Dr Eilidh Whiteford said: "Despite Westminster's disastrous economic record, youth unemployment is at its lowest level for five years in Scotland as a result of Scottish government action.
"The Scottish government's Opportunities For All scheme offers every 16 to 19-year-old a place in work, education or training - and as a result, 90% of school leavers are going into positive destinations."
