Lewis Haunch, from Leigh in Greater Manchester, underwent emergency treatment but he was pronounced dead shortly after midnight.
A police spokesman said: "Inquiries are still ongoing into his death and how he obtained the substance he took."
Two 17-year-old males have been arrested in the Greater Manchester area on suspicion of drugs offences and are in custody.
Chief Superintendent Keith Gilert, Leeds Festival's police commander, said: "At this time the indications are that the man consumed drugs immediately before he collapsed.  A report will be sent to the coroner in due course."
Issuing a warning to festival-goers about the dangers of illegal drugs, he said anyone who had concerns for themselves or others should contact festival site or security staff or seek medical assistance.
