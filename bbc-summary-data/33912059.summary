Inverclyde schools welcome record 19 sets of twins

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Schools in Inverclyde are preparing to welcome a record 19 sets of twins.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The new P1 pupils will have teachers across the area seeing double when they begin the new term on Monday.
The new intake means there will be a total of 72 sets of twins at primary schools in Inverclyde.
Education officials were surprised when the number of twins rose to 16 in 2011. The huge increase since then has left them wondering if there is "something in the water".
