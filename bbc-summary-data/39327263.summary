An extra police constable will be added to every ward in London under plans unveiled by the city's mayor.

Each borough will also focus on priorities set for their local area while there will be improved support for victims, Sadiq Khan said.
Mr Khan said the plan "restores real neighbourhood policing" and "puts victims... at the heart of what we do".
The Conservatives accused the mayor of having "noble intentions" but "a distinct lack of detail".
Each of the 629 wards currently has one dedicated PC and one police community support officer (PCSO).
Under the plan at least one more officer will be assigned to work in every area by the end of 2017 to "provide greater visibility, contact and reassurance in communities".
Other ideas set out by Mr Khan include:
The Met will also no longer be given fixed crime reduction targets but focus on how well they tackle set local priorities in each borough.
Sophie Linden, deputy mayor for Policing and Crime, said the plan "enables the police... to make the biggest difference we can with the resources we have."
But Conservative London Assembly member Steve O'Connell said the change "to borough-specific targets will make it difficult to assess progress across London as a whole".
"We will have to wait and see what impact this plan has in real terms on our streets," he said
