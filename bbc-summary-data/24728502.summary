Lough Neagh to get £2.58m from Heritage Lottery Fund

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Lough Neagh is to receive £2.58m in funding from the Heritage Lottery Fund (HLF).

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Lough Neagh, in the centre of Northern Ireland, is bounded by five counties and is the largest freshwater lake in the UK and Ireland.
The money will be used for a five-year landscape partnership scheme.
It will include projects to conserve and manage the heritage of the area and plans include developing a heritage trail along the entire shoreline.
Archaeological digs and workshops and wetland and peat land conservation are also envisaged.
Paul Mullan, head of HLF Northern Ireland, said: "The shoreline and islands of Lough Neagh have a distinct landscape character and a rich, but little known heritage.
"The area is hugely important as a home to a host of wildlife, and for providing a place for people to enjoy water and outdoor activities.
"It also has a strong community who are keen to play their part in securing the long term future of the lough, its heritage and economic potential."
Shane O'Neill, chairman of Lough Neagh Partnership Project, added: "We are delighted that Heritage Lottery Fund has awarded a landscape partnership grant to Lough Neagh.
"Lough Neagh has a very rich and diverse natural, cultural and built heritage and we look forward to developing the project with our partners."
