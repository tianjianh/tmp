Steve Evans: Ex-Leeds United boss rejects Oldham Athletic offer

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Former Leeds United boss Steve Evans has rejected an offer to become the new manager of Oldham Athletic.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Evans, 53, agreed personal terms but a statement on the Latics' website said he would not sign a contract as he has "other offers in the pipeline".
The Scot left Leeds in May after seven months in charge, and has previously had stints in charge at Rotherham, Crawley and Boston United.
Oldham finished 17th in League One last term, eight points clear of relegation.
Whoever takes charge at SportsDirect.com Park will become Oldham's seventh full-time manager in the past six years, a period which has often seen the club fighting relegation.
Oldham had a winding-up petition brought by HM Revenue & Customs dismissed on Monday, but they did have problems with paying their players last season.
The Latics will spend a 20th year in the third tier next term and have not finished in the top half of the table since 2009.
