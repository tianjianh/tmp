An Australian mother who gave birth to quintuplets in January has released a photo shoot of her unlikely new arrivals.

Perth resident Kim Tucci, 26, took just two minutes to give birth to her four daughters and one son, who were conceived naturally.
A team of 50 doctors and nurses assisted with the planned caesarean and all of the children were born healthy.
The chance of conceiving quintuplets naturally is about one in 55 million.
Mrs Tucci's story gained prominence through her Facebook page, Surprised by Five, where she recorded the details of her pregnancy.
Local business Erin Elizabeth Photography, which helped document Mrs Tucci's pregnancy, organised the quintuplets' photo shoot.
"50 fingers 50 toes, 6 hearts beating at once. My body fought the toughest of battles to get five babies here safely," Mrs Tucci, 26, wrote when she posted the photos.
"Everything I did I did for them."
In an interview with Australian current affairs program 60 Minutes in April, Mrs Tucci said she felt like her body was "shutting down" during the pregnancy.
She said that doctors originally offered her the choice of saving two of the babies while terminating the others, due to serious health risks to both her and the unborn children.
"No-one thought I could do it, and I did, I showed everyone in my life," Mrs Tucci told 60 Minutes.
Mrs Tucci and her husband Vaughn already have a nine-year-old son and daughters aged two and four.
The Tuccis are attempting to raise money for a van that is big enough to fit their entire family.
