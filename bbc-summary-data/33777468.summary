The last confirmed sighting of Derek Serpell-Morris, also known as DJ Derek, was over three weeks ago in the city.
Jennifer Griffiths, his great niece, said she was losing hope of finding him alive.
Police have released further CCTV footage, showing DJ Derek in The Criterion pub, at about 23:30 BST on 10 July - his last confirmed sighting.
On Monday, Avon and Somerset Police said they were re-focusing search efforts in the Yate area, after a "credible" sighting of him at Yate bus station on 16 or 17 July.
Speaking at a press conference, in which members of Mr Serpell-Morris's family appealed for anyone with information about him, Ms Griffiths said she did not think he was still alive.
"I'm not confident. I would have thought he'd have got in contact with somebody by now," she said.
"The fact that he hasn't taken any of his suitcases or his toiletries, or any money out of his bank accounts, suggests he's gone.
"I'm losing hope."
DJ Derek's family and friends have been conducting searches for him over the past few days.
The DJ, who was reported missing on 23 July, has played at the Glastonbury festival, released his own compilation album, appeared in a Dizzee Rascal video, and worked with Massive Attack.
