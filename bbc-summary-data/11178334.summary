Dave Heeley, known as Blind Dave, of West Bromwich, ran with guide Malcolm Carr on seven continents to raise money for Guide Dogs UK in 2008.
His next challenge in August 2011 will be over almost 1,000 miles in 10 days.
It will mark the 100th anniversary of the Macmillan Cancer Support charity, which the initiative is supporting.
Each day will start with a marathon run of 26.2 miles (42.16km), before going by bike to the next destination - an average of 75 miles (120.7km). Mr Heeley will be on the back of a tandem.
A friend of Mr Heeley of more than 35 years, who had cancer, died recently.
Mr Heeley said: "Cancer's effects touch all of us.
"I lost both my father and father-in-law, and then lost my last guide dog to cancer."
The event, starting on 10 August, coincides with the birthday in 1884 of the charity's founder, Douglas Macmillan.
Mr Heeley is aiming to complete the journey in 10 days to celebrate the charity's 10 decades in existence.
