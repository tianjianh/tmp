The 55-year-old will replace Dunga, who was sacked from his second spell in charge after Brazil were knocked out of the Copa America after losing to Peru.
Tite has won two league titles, the Copa Libertadores and the World Club Cup with Corinthians.
The club's president, Roberto de Andrade, said Tite had accepted a Brazil football federation (CBF) offer.
Earlier, CBF officials confirmed they had met Tite but said talks had been "inconclusive", adding that "the sides decided to take it up again soon".
Andrade said he was "furious" with the CBF, telling reporters: "They didn't even call us once."
"It wouldn't have changed anything if they'd called us and asked for permission to talk to the manager. Of course I'd have said yes," he added.
However, in a statement, the CBF said it had "strictly complied with the ethical and institutional procedures" during its search for a new coach.
The governing body said attempts to contact Andrade had been unsuccessful despite efforts lasting nearly 10 hours, and added it would begin "arrangements for hiring the coach" from Thursday onwards.
