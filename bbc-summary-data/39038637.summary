Police in Falkirk have spoken to more than 400 people as part of an investigation to trace a 70-year-old man who has been missing for 11 days.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
George Stevenson was last seen in the High Station Road area of the town at about 23:00 on 10 February.
He has failed to return to his home in Glenfuir Court or make contact with his family or friends.
Officers have appealed for residents to check private CCTV footage which may have captured images of Mr Stevenson.
Police have visited more than 300 homes as part of the investigation and returned to High Station Road a week after Mr Stevenson was last seen.
Uniformed and CID officers have also been deployed, along with the Police Scotland Marine Unit and helicopter.
Det Insp Jim Thomson said:  "It is now our belief that George may have been in the Gartcows Road area of Falkirk on the night of Friday, 10 February.
"I would appeal to anyone who remembers seeing or speaking to George to get in touch with us.
"We are particularly keen to speak to anyone living in Gartcows Road with private CCTV as this may have captured images of George as he made his way along the street."
Mr Stevenson is 5ft 8in tall, with thinning hair on top and longer hair at the back and sides.
He was believed to be wearing a green tammy hat, black jacket, long cardigan, a blue and white checked shirt, black jeans and khaki trainers.
