Here we pay tribute to some of those famous faces who have left us in the last 12 months.
January was marked by the loss of a trio of actresses who were defined by the roles they played.
Anne Kirkbride, who died after a short illness at the age of 60, will forever be remembered as Coronation Street's Deidre, who endured multiple marriages and wrongful imprisonment during her 42 years on the soap.
Despite a long and varied career on stage and screen, Geraldine McEwan captured the public's imagination with her controversial, waspish Miss Marple. And Swedish bombshell Anita Ekberg - aka The Iceberg - was scarcely mentioned without a reference to her iconic role in Federico Fellini's La Dolce Vita.
In the same month, we also bade farewell to Thorn Birds author Colleen McCullough, conductor Israeli Yinon, actor Rod Taylor and The Avengers scriptwriter Brian Clemens.
President Obama led the tributes to Leonard Nimoy in February after the Star Trek actor died in Los Angeles at the age of 83. "Long before being nerdy was cool, there was Leonard Nimoy," said the US president of the man who played Mr Spock.
The same month saw the untimely death of New Romantic pioneer Steve Strange at the age of 55. The Fade to Grey singer was hailed by his friends and fellow music stars as "a major face of the '80s" and "a maverick to the end".
Other notable deaths in February included veteran US news correspondent Bob Simon, composer and pianist John McCabe (whose recordings of Joseph Haydn's piano sonatas are considered definitive), pop singer Lesley Gore, of It's My Party fame, and Octopussy actor Louis Jourdan.
March was dominated by the death of fantasy author and creator of the Discworld series Sir Terry Pratchett at the age of 66. The author, who campaigned for assisted suicide after being diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease in 2007, wrote more than 70 books in a career spanning 44 years. "Nothing was beyond his powers of imagination," said fellow author Val McDermid. "He made you look at the world around you differently."
German architect Frei Otto, Free bassist Andy Fraser - co-writer of the 1970 hit All Right Now - and Swedish poet and Nobel laureate Thomas Transtroemer passed on in March. So did Richard Glatzer, co-writer and director of Still Alice, for which Julianne Moore picked up an Oscar in February.
April saw the departure of two inspirational figures from the world of arts and entertainment. Author and Nobel Prize-winner Guenter Grass - a cultural giant in his native Germany - died at the age of 87, while soul singer Ben E King, best known for the classic song Stand By Me, died aged 76.
Meanwhile, 67-year-old ventriloquist Keith Harris left behind fluffy green duck Orville, with whom he became a household name on British television in the 1980s; and fans of Everybody Loves Raymond mourned the tragic loss of former child star Sawyer Sweeten (pictured above with his twin brother Sullivan), who took his own life at the age of 19.
Singer Percy Sledge, famed for the song When a Man Loves a Woman, and actor James Best, best known as Sheriff Rosco P Coltrane in The Dukes of Hazzard, also died this month at 73 and 88 respectively.
Ruth Rendell - who last year led the tributes to her friend and fellow crime author PD James - died in May, at the age of 85, following a stroke earlier in the year. The writer penned more than 60 novels. Her best-known creation was Inspector Wexford, a character that spawned a highly successful TV series.
May also saw the death of two musicians, though their styles were very different. King of the Blues, singer and guitarist BB King was mourned by musicians the world over, including Ringo Starr, Eric Clapton and Richie Sambora. Hot Chocolate star Errol Brown, who co-wrote chart smashes including You Sexy Thing, died from liver cancer at the age of 71.
Comedian Anne Meara, mother of actor Ben Stiller, also died in May, as did Star Trek actress Grace Lee Whitney and Bond costume designer Julie Harris.
June saw the deaths of a trio of great British screen stars and three memorable contributors to the musical world.
Sir Christopher Lee, a legend of the big screen who was forever stamped on cinemagoers' minds as Count Dracula, died aged 93. Character actor Ron Moody, best known for playing Fagin in Lionel Bart's musical Oliver!, died aged 91, and fellow nonagenarian Patrick Macnee - aka John Steed of the cult TV series The Avengers - died aged 93.
Hollywood reeled at the death of Oscar-winning composer James Horner, who perished in a plane crash at the age of 61. Best known for his score to the James Cameron blockbuster Titanic, he also wrote the music for Apollo 13, Braveheart and Avatar, among other films.
Big Band leader James Last - who made millions recording upbeat versions of pop and classical favourites with his orchestra - died aged 86, while Chris Squire, bass guitarist and co-founder of '70s prog rock band Yes, died at 67.
It was brooding good looks that catapulted Egyptian actor Omar Sharif, who died in July at the age of 83, to stardom. The winner of three Golden Globes for his roles in both Lawrence of Arabia and Doctor Zhivago, Sharif died of a heart attack in Cairo.
Val Doonican - the crooner in the rocking chair who became a mainstay of Saturday night television in the '60s and '70s - was remembered for his colourful knitwear, good humour and consummate professionalism.
Tragically, July also saw the death of 22-year-old Bobbi Kristina Brown - the only daughter of Whitney Houston and R&B singer Bobby Brown. In an uncomfortable echo of her mother's death in 2012, the aspiring actress was discovered face down and unresponsive in a bath on 31 January and placed in a medically induced coma. She never regained consciousness.
US country singer Lynn Anderson, producer Jerry Weintraub - whose hits included both the Ocean's Eleven and Karate Kid franchises - and opera tenor Jon Vickers also passed away this month.
The loss of Cilla Black left the British showbiz industry in shock, after the TV singer, presenter and all-round entertainer died suddenly at the age of 72 in August. The death of Cilla, a '60s singing star and host of hit '80s shows Blind Date and Surprise Surprise, prompted an outpouring of tributes from the likes of Sir Paul McCartney, Des O'Connor and Sir Bruce Forsyth.
The death of Minder star George Cole marked another significant loss for British television later that month. The actor - defined by his roles as Arthur Daley and St Trinian's spiv Flash Harry - died in hospital following a short illness, aged 90.
The dance scene went into mourning after the untimely death of Jonathan Ollivier in a motorbike accident at the age of 38. Choreographer Matthew Bourne called him "one of the most charismatic and powerful dancers of his generation".
Also in August, the broadcasting world paid tribute to Stephen Lewis, who played officious inspector "Blakey" in 1970s sitcom On the Buses; Emmerdale actress Kitty McGeever, the first blind actress to star in a British soap; Yvonne Craig, best known for playing Batgirl in the 1960s Batman TV series; and Susan Sheridan, who appeared in the original Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy radio series.
British-born novelist Jackie Collins was described as "one of a kind" in a statement announcing her death from breast cancer at the age of 77 in September. The writer, famous for such raunchy novels as Hollywood Wives, Lucky and The World is Full of Married Men, was the sister of actress Joan Collins.
In the same month, Hollywood bade farewell to director Wes Craven, who was credited with re-inventing the teen horror genre with his hit Nightmare on Elm Street film franchise. The 76-year-old, who died from brain cancer, also created the Scream films, which grossed more than $300m (Â£195m) in the US alone.
Actor Dean Jones, star of The Love Bug and one of Disney's major stars of the '60s and '70s, also died in September. His role in the popular Herbie films made him a household name, but he was also remembered for his striking vocals in Stephen Sondheim's Broadway musical Company. He was 84.
Art critic Brian Sewell, singer Joy Beverley - one of the Beverley Sisters trio - and conductor Sir David Willcocks also died in September.
Henning Mankell, the man who gave us Swedish detective Kurt Wallander, died in October at the age of 67. Sir Kenneth Branagh, who starred in BBC adaptations of his crime novels, hailed the author's "immense contribution to Scandinavian literature" as well as his "provocative intelligence and great personal generosity".
Irish-American actress Maureen O'Hara was part of the golden era of Hollywood. A glamorous redhead and talented singer, she starred alongside John Wayne in five films as well as family favourites Miracle on 34th Street and The Hunchback of Notre Dame. Actress Jessica Chastain paid tribute on learning of her death at 95: "From one tough redhead broad to another. Thankful for the light you shared."
Antiques Roadshow host Hugh Scully, Towering Inferno director John Guillermin, Three Dog Night singer Cory Wells, newsreader Gordon Honeycombe and Coronation Street's Derek Wilton, aka actor Peter Baldwin, were also mourned in October.
Two actors who became stalwarts of British television in the 1970s and '80s died in November. Warren Mitchell - best known for playing the curmudgeonly Alf Garnett in Till Death Do Us Part - died aged 89, just before Saeed Jaffrey, whose eclectic career encompassed Shakespeare, Bollywood, Stephen Frears' film My Beautiful Launderette and Coronation Street. Jaffrey, who also appeared in ITV's The Jewel in the Crown and Channel 4 sitcom Tandoori Nights, was 86.
US R&B musician Allen Toussaint, who suffered a heart attack shortly after coming off stage in Madrid, was credited with "bringing the New Orleans sound to the national stage". Steven Spielberg paid tribute to Oscar-nominated ET screenwriter Melissa Mathison, saying she had "a heart that shined with generosity and love".
Other figures to pass away included Peter Donaldson, the newsreader dubbed the "quintessential voice of Radio 4"; former Motorhead drummer "Philthy Animal" Phil Taylor; Colin Welland, who famously declared "the British are coming" at the 1982 Oscars; and Gunnar Hansen, who played Leatherface in The Texas Chain Saw Massacre.
December began with the tragic death of Stone Temple Pilots singer Scott Weiland. The grunge star died on tour at the age of 48. He was saluted by colleagues from the music scene including Slash, who played with him in the supergroup Velvet Revolver.
Actor Robert Loggia, whose career spanned more than 50 years, was best known for films including Scarface, Big and Jagged Edge, for which he was nominated for an Oscar in 1986. He was still working up to his death, at the age of 85, in early December.
In the same month, British TV fans bade farewell to two familiar faces - Are You Being Served?'s Mr Rumbold, aka actor Nicholas Smith, who passed away aged 81, and Emmerdale's Shirley Stelfox, best known for her role as Edna Birch in the ITV soap, which she had played for the last 15 years. She died following a short illness, at the age of 74.
Finally, the world of rock and roll mourned one of music's true originals.
Ian 'Lemmy' Kilminster, singer, bassist and lyricist of legendary metal band Motorhead, died of cancer at the age of 70.
Motorhead's 1980 hit Ace of Spades is rightly regarded as one of the most popular and influential rock singles of all time, and musicians queued up to pay their respects on Twitter.
"Lost one of my best friends today," stated Ozzy Osbourne simply. "He will be sadly missed. He was a warrior and a legend."
