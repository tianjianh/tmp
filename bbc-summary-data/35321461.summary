A new exhibition will feature selected submissions from the university's Research as Art competition.
Open to researchers from all subjects, the competition asked researchers to tell the story of their projects, accompanied by an image.
The images will be on show in Mayfair from 1 February to 2 March 2016.
"We are delighted to have this opportunity to display Swansea research in the heart of London, in one of the world's leading scientific institutions," said Dr Richard Johnston, founder of the competition.
