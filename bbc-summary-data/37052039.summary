Shane O'Donoghue scored in the first minute and added a second three minutes before the end of the second quarter.
Peter Caruth flicked home the third but Scott Tupper replied with strikes in the third and fourth quarters.
Mitch Darling made victory safe and a win over Argentina will be enough to seal a last-eight spot at the Games.
The Irish had lost their opening three games of the tournament to India, the Netherlands and Olympic champions Germany.
Following Ireland's triumph over the Canadians, Germany clinched a last-gasp 4-4 draw with Argentina to ensure that a victory for the Irish against the Argentines would see Craig Fulton's men claim a quarter-final place.
O'Donoghue gave the Irish the best possible start when he brilliantly converted from a penalty corner for his 52nd international goal.
The Glenanne man added a second from another penalty corner, before Caruth slid to fire home the third from a rebound.
Tupper grabbed his first seven minutes into the second half and made Ireland sweat by finding the net again with 10 minutes remaining.
Darling eased Irish nerves with his goal with four minutes left.
