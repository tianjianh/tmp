The deal will see Binn take over Holden's Shore Road site.
Binn, which is based in Glenfarg, said it would continue trading from the Perth yard, securing the jobs of all 10 employees.
Holden has operated in Perth for more than 70 years, developing its original scrap business into a skip hire, waste management and recycling company.
Binn chief executive Allan MacGregor said the deal represented "an exciting phase" in the company's growth plans.
He added: "Binn Group has a long-term plan to expand into urban satellite sites in key locations throughout Scotland.
"Buying over Holden's well-established business within Perth fulfils the first phase of that ambition."
Binn currently employs more than 100 people.
