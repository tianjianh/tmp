[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Scott Jefferson, 22, who was told he must serve at least 20 years in prison, stabbed Uriel Moskwa, 43, in Aldwych Drive, on 27 September.
Jefferson, of Stanley Street, Wallsend, denied murder but was convicted by a Newcastle Crown Court jury.
Jamie Leigh Denley, 22, of Belford Terrace, North Shields admitted affray and possession of a blade.
She was handed an 11-month sentence, suspended for 24 months, and told she must comply with a curfew and supervision order.
Stevan Newton, 21, of Stanley Street, Wallsend, who also admitted affray and possession of a blade, will be sentenced at a later date.
Mr Moskwa, of North King Street, North Shields, died in hospital after being found with a single stab wound.
Speaking after Jefferson's sentencing, Det Ch Insp Nicola Musgrove said the attack had been "senseless" with "tragic consequences".
"I hope this case will remind people of the dangers of carrying knives and how quickly a situation can deteriorate and spiral out of control," she said.
