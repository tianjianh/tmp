On 30 January 1915, England played Scotland in a charity match organised by former England international and Northampton Saints captain Edgar Mobbs.
The aim of the game had been to recruit sportsmen to Mobbs' World War One battalion.
The commemorative match took place at Olney Rugby Club's East Street home.
Players from the East Midlands region lined up against The 1st Battalion of the Yorkshire Regiment. The East Midlands team won 41 - 21.
Special guest for the day was Mobbs' great-nephew, also called Edgar Mobbs.
Mr Mobbs said his famous namesake had come up with the idea of playing rugby matches to boost morale while his troops were training at Shoreham in Kent.
He said they had been at a "pretty unpleasant" tented camp when Mobbs decided to do something to "encourage people to rally round the flag".
Having retired from rugby in 1913 aged 30, he had been refused an officer's commission when war broke out because of his age. Instead, he joined as a private.
The international match in 1915 is said to have inspired hundreds of men to sign up to his own corps, the Sportman's Battalion, which formed a significant part of the 7th Battalion of the Northamptonshire Regiment.
Among these were 16 Olney players who died during the war.
Mobbs went from private to battalion commander and was awarded the Distinguished Service Order, before being killed during the battle of Passchendale on 31 July 1917.
"When I was young people used to come up to me, tell me all about Edgar and say they were named after him as well," said Mobbs' nephew.
