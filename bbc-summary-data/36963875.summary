Hull City fans plan protest during Premier League opener against Leicester

Hull City fans are planning a protest against the "ill-considered ideas" of the newly-promoted club's owners on the first day of the Premier League season.

The Tigers, who host Leicester on 13 August, have been without a manager since Steve Bruce resigned after a fall out with vice-chairman Ehab Allam.
City are yet to make a summer signing.
"It's clear the desire to protest against the way the club is being run is stronger than ever before," said the Hull City Supporters' Trust (HCST).
Owner Assem Allam, who took charge of the Tigers in December 2010, put the club up for sale in 2014 after the Football Association turned down his request to change their name to Hull Tigers.
The East Yorkshire club opened talks with an interested party in May, but put takeover talks on hold until September to "ensure stability during the transfer window".
However, City have a threadbare squad after failing to sign any new players and a number of senior players were injured.
The club, who were promoted after winning the Championship play-off final in May, had an approach to speak to Wales boss Chris Coleman about replacing Bruce turned down by the Football Association of Wales (FAW) on Monday.
"No communication, no manager, no engagement, no signings, no identity, no concessions, no honesty. The list goes on," added the HCST statement.
"The owners are digging their heels in more than ever, discarding people at an alarming rate and pushing ahead with all of their ill-considered ideas with their usual arrogance and complete lack of interest in the damaging effects they will have.
"We will be organising and coordinating protests over the coming weeks."
A section of supporters held up red cards during April's home win against Brentford and the Trust said it would expand on that idea as part of the protest.
"Cards alone are not enough though, so we'll be organising additional protests, but we'd like to keep some of this as a surprise for maximum impact," it added.
