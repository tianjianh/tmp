[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Hull City twice came from behind to rescue a point as Steve Bruce's side got their Championship play-off push back on track at Huddersfield.

Jamie Paterson fired home a left-foot shot to give Town a half-time lead.
Abel Hernandez levelled with a left-foot volley on 76 minutes, only for Harry Maguire to then head into his own net in the final minute of normal time.
But Adama Diomande headed the Tigers level again at the John Smith's Stadium with a 93rd-minute equaliser.
The result still leaves Bruce's men with only one win in nine matches, but it was still a positive response to Tuesday night's 4-0 defeat at Derby.
Huddersfield were well worth their lead fashioned from a fine sweeping move down the left which finally saw on-loan Middlesbrough defender James Husband square for Paterson to find the bottom corner for 12 yards to mark his 200th career appearance.
After visiting manager's son Alex Bruce fired over from six yards on the stroke of half time, it looked as if the Tigers' poor run of results was set to continue.
It took some fine saves from Allan McGregor to keep the score level before Hernandez equalised.
It looked as if Huddersfield had then won it when Harry Bunn's left-wing cross was turned into his own goal by Maguire, but substitute Diomande headed home a deflected header at the far post to secure a draw.
Hull remain fourth, nine points behind second-placed Middlesbrough while Huddersfield, who came into the game on the back of successive defeats by Middlesbrough and Sheffield Wednesday, are now nine points clear of trouble.
Huddersfield boss David Wagner told BBC Radio Leeds:
"I am long enough in this business to know it is only over when the final whistle comes, but this is a very strong side.
"We were a little bit unlucky that there was a touch and we were not unable to avoid the header, but mistakes happen. It is part of the game.
"The timing was not the best today, but I am satisfied with the performance, with the reaction after the last game on Tuesday, when we criticised ourselves.
"We asked ourselves to show the right reaction against another very strong side and this is what we did."
Hull City manager Steve Bruce told BBC Radio Humberside:

"I have to say (automatic promotion) looks a bit remote at the minute because just at the wrong time we've stumbled.
"However, if we have to go through the play-offs, we have to cement our position in the play-offs first.
"There's six games to go and we can still get 18 points, which would take us to 88 points.
"Hopefully the goal from Abel Hernandez will kick-charge him in, but we've shot ourselves in the foot by missing big opportunities."
