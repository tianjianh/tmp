[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Scotland's largest cancer hospital has been told to improve the way it cares for acutely ill patients after safety concerns were raised.

Doctors at Glasgow's Beatson cancer centre spoke out in May amid a shake-up in services linked to the opening of the city's new south side hospital.
Their concerns were looked at by Healthcare Improvement Scotland.
It now wants NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde to agree a new model of care for critically ill patients.
It also said that the NHS board should work to rebuild trust with senior staff.
More than 50 professors and consultants at the Beatson warned that patients could be put at risk by proposed changes to services.
Doctors claimed the changes would leave inadequate staffing in the event of emergencies.
They wrote to the health secretary in May to say the situation was "desperate" and called for action.
Healthcare Improvement Scotland (HIS) said it established an inquiry team to look at the concerns and held a number of meetings with the health board and key staff.
It has now recommended that:
Robbie Pearson, director of scrutiny and assurance for HIS, said: "The Beatson is a world class centre of excellence for cancer care.
"The redesign of Glasgow's acute services is amongst the most substantial and complex in any hospital service within Europe.
"There is work to be done to make this an even more effective service that provides the best quality of care for patients."
He added: "We are confident that our recommendations will be used by the NHS board to provide guidance and support for those working in the Beatson to help them deliver the necessary improvements."
NHS GGC said it accepted HIS's recommendations and would work with management and staff at the Beatson to make sure they were implemented.
Dr Jennifer Armstrong, medical director at NHS GGC, said: "We welcome the report of the inquiry team and the opportunity this provides for NHS GGC management team and consultants at the Beatson to move forward in a constructive way.
"We are pleased that the inquiry has found that the High Acuity Unit is effective and a positive and welcome development which has improved the treatment of acutely unwell patients and also those whose condition is deteriorating.
"All those involved - our oncology doctors and nurses, our critical care doctors and nurses and the Beatson management team - reported to the inquiry that the unit is working well and providing a high quality of service to patients. Patient feedback has also been very positive."
Dr Armstrong added: "Our monitoring and review of the service has shown that it was safe four months ago when it was introduced and remains safe today.
"We do accept however that, while our arrangements are safe and patient care has not been compromised, we can do more to mitigate any risks of introducing this new way of working.
"We are fully committed to making these improvements in partnership with our clinical colleagues."
