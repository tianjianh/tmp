[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The oldest pub in a Ceredigion seaside town, said to have inspired Dylan Thomas poems, will be turned into accommodation by Brains Brewery.

The Dolau Inn at New Quay, which opened in the 18th Century, is on the Dylan Thomas trail.
A petition to try and save the pub has received 500 signatures in a week, with campaigners saying a lot of local history is linked to the building.
Brains, which owns the pub, has been asked to comment.
Mel Newman, who started the petition, said: "It's not just the oldest pub but it's one of the oldest buildings in New Quay. I think it's important it remains here."
Historian Sue Passmore said the pub dates back to the 1750s.
"Dylan Thomas wrote his Quite Early One Morning play in New Quay when he was living here during the Second World War," she said.
"You can tell when listening to it or reading it that it's definitely based on New Quay and its locals. And if you look at Under Milk Wood you can see that is just a development of Quite Early One Morning.
"So it'd be a real shame if the Dolau stopped being a pub as it's been such a part of New Quay."
