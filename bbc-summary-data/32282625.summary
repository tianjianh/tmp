Londonderry to Coleraine rail line upgrade delayed by four months

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Work on a second major upgrade to the Londonderry-to-Coleraine railway line has been delayed by four months.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The work, originally due to start next month, is now planned to begin in September subject to a procurement process.
Â£16.2m has been allocated to Translink for the railway upgrade.
Last year, Translink said an hourly service on the route was a "priority".
The second stage of the upgrade involves major re-signalling between Derry and Coleraine and the introduction of a passing loop.
