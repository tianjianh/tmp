[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The officer was attacked by Shamal Karim Asaad, 30, in Peterborough on 1 September 2015.
The officer's bodycam shows him repeatedly telling Asaad to "back off" before falling and breaking his leg.
Asaad, of Kipling Court, Peterborough, denied grievous bodily harm but was found guilty and given 18 months.
On Wednesday, Peterborough Crown Court also gave him three months each for two further charges of destroying and damaging property, to run concurrently.
The civil enforcement officer, who works for Peterborough City Council, described what happened as "one of the most terrifying [moments] of my life".

He had issued Asaad with a penalty charge notice (PCN) for parking illegally in a residential permit area on Hankey Street.
Asaad emerged from a nearby house, took the ticket from the car and waved it in the officer's face.
Bodycam footage shows Assad complaining it was the second ticket he had received that day.
The officer, who wanted to remain anonymous, can be heard saying: "Back off, I'm warning you, back off."
Asaad demanded the officer take the ticket back and swore several times at the officer, who continued to tell him to "back off".
The officer called for police back-up and Asaad then got in his car and drove off.
Minutes later the officer saw the car parked in the street again. He approached it and was attacked by Asaad.
The officer can be heard shouting "he's grabbed my equipment" before falling and breaking his leg.
"I will never forget the feeling of panic when I was lying on the ground with my attacker's face, centimetres from mine, contorted with rage. It was like something out of a horror film," he said in a statement.
Although he has since returned to work the officer said he had been left with semi-permanent nerve damage for which he needs "constant pain relief".
