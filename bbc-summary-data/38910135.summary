The local authority in the Scottish Borders has approved a 3% council tax increase as part of its budget plans.

The ruling SNP/Independent/Lib Dem coalition outlined its proposals for the region last week.
Key investment areas include roads, bridges, schools, flood protection and economic development.
However, up to 123 posts could be lost as part of the plans, although the council said the final figure was "likely to be far less".
The authority currently has a workforce of about 4,500.
Council leader David Parker said the budget reflected an "ongoing commitment to protect frontline services and deliver significant investment".
The spending plans aim to save about £9.5m in the financial year ahead.
The council said an impact on staffing levels was "inevitable" but it would be achieved by managing vacancies, natural turnover and offering redeployment as well as early retirement and voluntary severance.
The local authority has estimated an increase in council tax will raise £1.5m towards funding its services.
The change will see payments for a band D property rise by £32.52 per year.
Higher band properties will see their charges rise by more than 3% due to national changes agreed last year.
