The second victim was holding a party celebrating the life of his friend when he was stabbed, the BBC has been told.
The first man, 27-year-old Martin Maughan, was found in West Walk, Sneinton, just after 06:00 GMT on Saturday.
The second, aged 38, was found with stab wounds to his chest in Mill View Close, Sneinton, at 04:20 on Sunday.
It's understood the two victims were friends.
The 38-year-old man who was stabbed early this morning was holding a party to celebrate the life of the 27-year-old man who was stabbed 24 hours earlier in Sneinton.
Neighbours have told us someone at the party stole the host's phone and he gave chase and was stabbed, it's believed three times.
He was described as lovely, friendly and kind.
Nottinghamshire Police said two murder inquiries had been launched and have appealed for information.
Two men, aged 19 and 43, have been arrested over the first stabbing and are being questioned by detectives.
Police say no other people are being sought in relation to this stabbing.
They are looking for another man in relation to the second stabbing, but have not said whether or not he was at the party.
Ch Insp Mark Stanley of Nottinghamshire Police said: "The murders are not believed to be linked and we're treating them as separate incidents.
"The early indications are that these incidents are confined to people who are known to each other and who were at addresses they were invited to."
