Rio 2016: Narsingh Yadav failed drugs test result of 'sabotage'

Indian wrestler Narsingh Yadav's failed drugs test was a result of "sabotage", according to a ruling by his country's anti-doping disciplinary panel.

He tested positive for banned substances but claimed his food was spiked with steroids by two fellow wrestlers and made a police complaint.
The 26-year-old was provisionally suspended from competing at the Rio Olympics and replaced by Parveen Rana.
However, India's wrestling federation (WFI) will now try to reinstate Yadav.
The WFI says it will write to the World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada) and United World Wrestling (UWW) regarding the issue.
"There is no fault or negligence on the athlete's part and he is a victim of sabotage," said Navin Agarwal, the National Anti-Doping Agency's director-general.
Yadav was picked over two-time Olympic medallist Sushil Kumar after he won India's quota place with bronze at last year's World Championships.
"I want to thank everyone who supported me," he said. "It's a triumph for truth. Now I want to go to Rio and bring back a medal for India."
The men's freestyle wrestling competition starts on 19 August.
Indian shot put champion Inderjeet Singh also claimed he had failed a drugs test because of a "conspiracy" against him.
