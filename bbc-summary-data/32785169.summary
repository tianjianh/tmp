[SN]TITLE[SN]
Farmbox Meats: Dafydd Raw-Rees and Colin Patterson plead guilty

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Two men from Ceredigion have both admitted charges relating to the mislabelling of meat.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Farmbox Meats owner Dafydd Raw-Rees and employee Colin Patterson mislabelled goat as lamb or mutton.
Raw-Rees, who falsely labelled and broke food traceability regulations, received a conditional discharge.
Patterson received a 12-week sentence suspended for two years after admitting a traceability charge and 17 labelling offences.
The business based at Llandre, Aberystwyth, was raided by Food Standards Agency officials in 2013 at the height of an inquiry into the horsemeat mislabelling scandal.
However, none of the charges brought against the two men related to horsemeat.
Farmbox Meats Ltd went into receivership in June 2013.
Southwark Crown Court was told record-keeping at the plant was "a shambles".
The Food Standards Agency, Dyfed-Powys Police and Ceredigion council carried out a joint inquiry, which led to the accusations against the two men over the mislabelling of goat meat products.
