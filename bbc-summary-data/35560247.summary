Juma Munyankore, 25, and Hamza Mohumed, 24, carried out a "vicious, outrageous attack" which was seen by a child in a Coventry garden last September.
The pair were originally charged with attempted murder but the court accepted their guilty pleas to wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm.
Munyankore was jailed of 10 years, nine months and Mohumed for nine years, four months at Leamington Justice Centre.
Mohumed had entered a guilty plea to the lesser charge but Munyankore was handed a longer jail term at the hearing on Friday after admitting the offence on the fourth day of a trial.
Det Con Helen Keating, of West Midlands Police, said it was unclear what sparked the row between the two defendants and the 26-year-old victim they had known for seven years.
Doctors said he was "lucky to survive" his injuries to his chest and legs, with one wound puncturing one of his lungs, diaphragm and liver. They were inflicted by a half-moon shaped dagger.
"It was a vicious, outrageous attack in the middle of the afternoon and carried out just yards away from a young child," Det Con Keating said.
The victim, who had earlier gone to greet and shake hands with the pair as he walked to the barbecue, was airlifted to hospital after the afternoon attack on 11 September.
Officers found Mohumed, a Somalian national, hiding under a dressing gown at his home in The Bentree, in the Stoke area of Coventry, two days after the attack.
Meanwhile Munyankore, a Rwandan national, of Middleborough Road, Radford, was handed over to police by his mother hours after officers carried out a warrant at his home.
