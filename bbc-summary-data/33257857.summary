High Court reviews 'Magna Carta' community eviction

A possession order against squatters on land near the Magna Carta memorial is being reviewed by a High Court judge.

Guildford County Court had granted the order to developer Orchid Runnymede last week.
On Tuesday, a High Court judge ordered a transcript of the county court hearing and said any action to evict the Surrey squatters had to wait.
Orchid Runnymede said it still believed it would win. The squatters said the decision gave them more time.
In a statement, the developers said the county court order was clear on the legitimate rights of private landowners to possession of their land against trespassers.
They said the order was "effective forthwith", the squatters were refused leave to appeal and steps were taken to begin an eviction - but the squatters went to the Court of Appeal.
Orchid Runnymede said the transcript would be paid for by public funds. The company added: "This is a delaying tactic by the squatters, which is costing taxpayers money."
Ieuan Davies, a member of the Runnymede Eco-Village community on Coopers Hill, said the High Court action gave community members more time to look for other places to live - especially those with children.
He said the group had been arguing its rights to be in the woodland under Magna Carta and the Forest Charter, and he said these were the "rights of the dispossessed" famously referred to in Rudyard Kipling's poem The Reeds of Runnymede.
Mr Davies said he agreed with Orchid Runnymede that the squatters were unlikely to succeed but he said he welcomed the reprieve.
"The law is weighed much heavier in favour of the landowner," he added.
The county court hearing was held as thousands of people including the Queen gathered at Runnymede to celebrate 800 years of Magna Carta.
