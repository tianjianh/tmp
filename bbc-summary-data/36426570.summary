Isle of Man General Election: nomination deadline set

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Candidates intending to stand in the Isle of Man general elections this September have been reminded of the deadline for nominations.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Nomination day is 24 August and anyone intending to stand must enrol on the electoral register by 17 June.
Every five years, the House of Keys is dissolved and a general election is held to elect 24 members.
A government spokesman said an accurate register is "essential for the integrity of the democratic process".
On April 1, there were 59,097 names on the register - about 10,000 of these have been added since January.
A reform of the Isle of Man's electoral boundaries was approved by Tynwald in 2013.
The new system means a reduction in the number of island constituencies from 15 to 12, with each of the newly-defined areas to be represented by two members of the House of Keys.
The changes, said the government, bring an end to a system where some Manx residents get three votes, and others get just one.
The island's 2016 general election is due to take place on 22 September.
