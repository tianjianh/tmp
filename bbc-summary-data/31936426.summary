US fraternity's 12-month ban over secret Facebook page

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A US university fraternity has been suspended while police investigate allegations that nude female photos were posted to a private Facebook page.

A former member of Kappa Delta Rho at Pennsylvania State University told police about pictures of drug deals, hazing and women passed out or drunk.
The university called the allegations a "violation" of standards and values.
The fraternity's national executive director told the chapter it must reorganise when it resumes in a year.
Joe Rosenberg said in a letter to the fraternity the suspension was "for the most serious misconduct, most serious disregard of fraternity rules".
Fraternities are social organisations that college students, usually male, are given the option to join at many universities across the US. Sororities are a similar option for female students.
"The evidence offered by the Facebook postings is appalling, offensive and inconsistent" with university standards, said Damon Sims, Penn State's vice president for student affairs.
Police said anyone who posted the photos could face charges of harassment or invasion of privacy.
Some of the postings involved nude women in "sexual or embarrassing positions", says the warrant, which has been seen by the Associated Press news agency.
"It appears from the photos provided that the individuals in the photos are not aware that the photos had been taken.''
Chapter officials have the power of appeal. They were not immediately available to comment.
