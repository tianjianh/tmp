[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A play which stunned Scottish audiences more than 40 years ago has been revived at a Dundee theatre.

The Cheviot, the Stag and the Black Black Oil tells the story of the nation's history, from the Highland clearances to the arrival of oil.
John McGrath's play had a political impact as well as a cultural one.
The Dundee Rep Ensemble has been granted permission to present the play in a professional production for the first time in more than 20 years.
The Cheviot was given its first public airing by the 7:84 Scotland group at the "What Kind of Scotland?" conference in Edinburgh in March 1973, and had an instant impact.
The play looks at the exploitation and economic changes in the Scottish Highlands throughout history, from the evictions of crofters to make way for Cheviot sheep in the 18th century, to the development of stag hunts in game parks in the 19th century, and finally the oil boom of the 1970s.
Director Joe Douglas said the issues addressed in the play were still relevant today.
He said: "It's something which is studied and talked about, and it's sort of entered the mythology of Scottish theatre.
"I felt like it really spoke to the present moment, post-referendum and post-general election, where people are sort of questioning where we're at politically.
"The play looks at lots of different aspects of Scottish identity, and tells the story of ordinary people from across many generations in different ways."
The play is presented as a ceilidh, with the music integral to the storytelling - some of the audience sit on the stage, with people encouraged to dance along.
Musical director Aly Macrae said this helps remove any barrier between the audience and the story being told.
Actor Calum MacDonald's mother saw the original production in 1973 and he said it had been "life-changing" for her.
He said: "It really changed her view on Scottish politics and Scottish history, and the way they presented it was brilliant for that audience.
"So there's quite a lot of pressure - I remember phoning her and letting her know. We've remained true to a lot of the original with slight touches to bring it up to date with current issues.
"There is a bit of pressure, but it's an absolute joy to be doing it."
The Cheviot, the Stag and the Black, Black Oil runs until 26 September at Dundee Rep theatre.
