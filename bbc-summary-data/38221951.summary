Bar Soba, which was first launched as a pop-up restaurant at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe in 1997, already has five sites across Glasgow, Edinburgh and Leeds.
It is now considering opening restaurants in Aberdeen, Newcastle, Liverpool and Manchester.
The expansion follows a Â£3m investment by the Business Growth Fund (BGF).
The company, which serves creative cocktails and South-East Asian street dishes, is on course to turn over in excess of Â£6m during the current financial year.
Following the initial expansion into the north of England, it hopes to eventually operate at 30 different locations.
Brad Stevens, founder and chief executive, said: "I'm really excited about our ambitious expansion plans and that we've found the right partner to provide the funding and expertise we need to accelerate our growth.
"Expanding to 12 city centre locations will allow even more drinkers and diners to enjoy our combination of indulgent cocktails, freshly prepared street food inspired by the night markets of South East Asia and music.
"We have been researching locations we feel will suit the Bar Soba offering but are always open to hear ideas from others."
As well as providing capital, BGF introduced the business to Mohan Mansigani, who has been appointed as non-executive chairman.
He served as chief finance officer at Casual Dining Group - the company behind brands including Bella Italia, CafÃ© Rouge and Belgo - from 2002 until 2014, having previously worked as finance director at Costa Coffee and TGI Fridays and in senior finance roles at Grand Metropolitan and Pizza Hut.
Mr Mansigani, said: "I've worked with some really vibrant brands during my career and I see many of the same elements in the DNA of Bar Soba.
"I'm looking forward to working with Brad to help him fulfil his ambitions for the business, which I believe will prove to be just as popular in the north of England and further afield as it has been in its Scottish heartland."
BGF's existing UK investments in the leisure and hospitality sectors include Mexican restaurant group Barburrito, tapas brand Camino, and Thai chain Giggling Squid.
