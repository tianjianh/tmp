[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A 38-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of causing death by dangerous driving and failing to stop after an accident.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The body of a woman was found in Hill Street, Kingswood, near Bristol, at about 00:45 GMT on Sunday.
Police said the 43-year-old's injuries were "consistent with her being involved in a road traffic collision".
A post-mortem examination and formal identification is due to take place later.
The death is still being treated as "unexplained" and police continue to appeal for information.
On Sunday Avon and Somerset Constabulary said about an hour before the woman was found dead, it received a call about a woman who was walking in the carriageway of the road.
Det Insp Louise Boyce said the incident had been referred to the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) as there had been police involvement before the woman's body was found.
