Justin Thomas equalled the 54-hole record on the PGA Tour as he extended his lead at the Sony Open in Hawaii to seven shots with a five-under-par 65 on Saturday.

It was the third successive day Thomas, 23, had entered the record books.
The American became the youngest man to record a sub-60 round on the PGA Tour with an opening 59 before a 64 on Friday gave him the lowest 36-hole total of all-time.
Zach Johnson is the nearest challenger.
Thomas, who led by five overnight, made eight successive pars before opening his birdie account on the par-five ninth, while he picked up further shots at the 10th, 14th, 16th and 18th to finish bogey-free and move to 188 after three rounds.
His score matches the 54-hole record set by compatriot Steve Stricker at the 2010 John Deere Classic.
Two-time major winner Johnson matched fellow American Thomas' third-round 65, while England's Justin Rose is among three players on 14 under par.
Scotland's Russell Knox is a shot further back as is American Kevin Kisner, who missed a putt from nine feet for eagle on the last that would have given him a round of 59. He instead tapped in for birdie for a 60.
The all-time 72-hole record on the PGA Tour is 254, shot by Tommy Armour III at the 2003 Valero Texas Open, and so Thomas would need to card a final round of 65 or under to beat it.
