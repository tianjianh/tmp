The Scottish justice secretary has said he wants a radical shake-up in the way women are punished for crimes.

Michael Matheson, who last year stopped plans for a new women's prison in Inverclyde, wants Scotland to "lead the world" with a fresh approach.
There are currently 450 women in Scottish jails, with the figure doubling in the past decade.
Mr Matheson will speak at an international summit in Edinburgh on the issue.
The justice secretary said jailing women wasn't part of his vision for a "modern and progressive country", and highlighted how many children of imprisoned mothers go into a cycle of offending.
He accepted serious offenders must be imprisoned, but has scrapped plans for a new jail, saying he wanted Scotland to be bolder and more ambitious in the way female offenders are managed.
On Thursday, he will be joined in Edinburgh by experts from Denmark, Sweden, Australia and Canada who are taking part in the three-day summit.
It is hoped their shared experiences can help shape Scotland's plan for dealing with female offenders.
