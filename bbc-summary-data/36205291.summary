The Irish-born actor plays Thomas Shelby, ambitious head of a gangster family in the BBC drama.
He said the people of the city had been "very forgiving" of his own much-maligned attempts to imitate their accent.
Speaking at the premiere of the show's third series, Murphy, 39, said the Brummie brogue was "not ugly, it's quite sexy".
He said he would test out his vocal skills on Peaky Blinders' creator, Steve Knight, who was born in the city.
"I would call him up and leave messages on his phone and see if he approves," he said.
The star said it was "really helpful" to have local talent featuring in the second series and referred to Harry Kirton, who plays Finn Shelby, as "great talent".
Members of the show's cast stepped on to the red carpet on Wednesday at The Mailbox in Birmingham.
Other notable figures from the West Midlands joined them, including comedian Jasper Carrott, Birmingham City manager Gary Rowett and model Ricki Hall.
Gaite Jansen, who plays a Russian duchess, Princess Tatiana Petrovna, had a different accent dilemma: "I'm Dutch and had to do a Russian accent. I had a dialect coach who helped me study how to speak English with a Russian accent.
She admits she didn't know much about Birmingham: "I learnt a lot though. Now I love it. And I love that Steven Knight has made Birmingham like this Wild West."
Steven Knight, who also writes the programme, said its makers hoped to do more filming in Birmingham when the fourth series goes into production.
"The locations that we have found have been North but the fourth series - which will happen - we will film far more in Birmingham," he said.
