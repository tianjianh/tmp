New Zealand v Wales: One win not enough for Warburton

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Sam Warburton will not "dance and celebrate" if Wales end their 63-year losing streak by beating New Zealand this summer.

Wales face the world champions in the first of three Tests next Saturday.
He says Wales celebrating a win after 26 defeats would "show how big the gap is if you're going to make a big deal out of beating them once".
Warburton also says any team-mate who believes Wales cannot win is "not the right guy to come on the tour".
Wales have not beaten the All Blacks since wing Ken Jones gathered flanker Clem Thomas' cross-kick to score the decisive try in Cardiff in 1953.
Warburton wants Wales to emulate England's 2003 World Cup winners, who beat New Zealand at Twickenham in November 2002 and won against them down under in a June, 2003 rematch ahead of taking the global crown.
"I wouldn't want to make a big deal out of beating them once," said Warburton.
He added: "Once isn't good enough really. You want to be regularly competitive with these teams."
Wales were regarded as Europe's strongest team at the 2015 World Cup as they reached the quarter-finals.
But they finished second behind rejuvenated England in the 2016 Six Nations.
New Zealand are top of World Rugby's rankings, with Wales in sixth while England - in fourth - are the only northern hemisphere team above Warren Gatland's men.
While Warburton expects his side to take on Steve Hansen's team in a positive frame of mind, he accepts the All Blacks "are massive favourites".
"They've been the world's best team for a long time now and they will be the best team we've played against, probably, in the last three or four years," he explained.
"The feeling of victory is what motivates you."
The match in Auckland will be the All Blacks' first since beating Australia 34-17 in the World Cup final.
Steve Hansen's side are going through a rebuilding phase, with Richie McCaw, Dan Carter, Ma'a Nonu and Conrad Smith among those to have retired from Test rugby.
But Warburton cites McCaw's open-side successor Sam Cane as an example of New Zealand's production line.
"They'll lose experience, but they'll never lose talent," said the Cardiff Blues open-side who is fit after a shoulder injury.
"Sam Cane for example - he's on 30 caps, he's captain of the Chiefs and he's filling Richie McCaw's boots and he's one of the best open-sides in the world already."
