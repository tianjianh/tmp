Dean Smith: Walsall turn down Rotherham approach for manager

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Promotion-chasing League One side Walsall have turned down an approach from Championship club Rotherham United to speak to Saddlers boss Dean Smith about their managerial vacancy.

Smith, 44, had been lined up to come in as successor to Steve Evans following his departure last week.
Walsall have confirmed that the approach was 'categorically rejected'.
The Saddlers, second in League One, currently stand just five places below Rotherham in the league pyramid.
The Millers lie 21st in the Championship, having lost six of their 10 matches this season.
A Walsall statement read: "In response to media speculation, the club can confirm it received an approach from a Championship club for permission to speak to Dean Smith. This approach was categorically rejected.
"As one of the longest serving managers in the country, Dean has been instrumental in the club's progress since his appointment and is fundamental to our future plans."
Meanwhile, Saddlers eight-goal top scorer Tom Bradshaw has been nominated for League One's player of the month award for September.
