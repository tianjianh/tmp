[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Matthew Cranch, 24, suffered multiple injuries in the incident at the Kent County Showground in April 2011.
He had been fired from a cannon mounted on a lorry during Scott May's Daredevil Stunt Show.
Mr Cranch, who was from the Isle of Man but was living in Newquay, Cornwall, died in hospital.
Mid-Kent and Medway coroner Patricia Harding told the hearing at Archbishop's Palace, Maidstone: "Matthew Cranch himself was performing a stunt called the human cannonball.
"There is a cannon mounted on the back of a lorry and it is fired into a safety net nearby.
"In this particular case, as Matthew was fired out of the cannon, the net collapsed, causing Mr Cranch to land on the ground."
Kent Police said in December 2012 that no criminal prosecution would be brought over the incident.
Mr Cranch's parents Michael and Pauline, his sister Eleanor and representatives from the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) and Maidstone Borough Council were at the inquest.
The hearing continues.
