Lewis Pugh Evans from Llanbadarn Fawr, Aberystwyth, had served for 20 years with the British Army when he carried out his actions in 1917 at Zonnebeke.
The citation accompanying his medal reads "For conspicuous bravery and leadership" and goes on: "His example of cool bravery stimulated in all ranks, the highest valour and determination to win."
The medal is now among a private collection held by Lord Ashcroft, the former Conservative deputy chairman.
