[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
This phase of the £3.9m scheme involves a 3ft (1m) diameter pipe being installed under Hambledon to divert flood water.
The project is designed to prevent a repeat of 2013/14 floods when the village was inundated for more than 40 days
Hampshire County Council said the scheme would benefit residents.
Work will also see floodwater culverts created in East Street, West Street and parts of Green Lane, and road resurfacing and re-shaping.
Neil Mason, of Manor Farm, whose property was effected by the flooding, told BBC Solent although the work would cause an inconvenience for residents, it was for the "greater good".
Preliminary sewer work starts today and the main work is due to start on 22 June when the B2150 Hambledon Road will be closed south of the Cams Hill junction
Hampshire County Council is funding around £2.5m of the scheme with £1.4m from the government.
Sean Woodward, of Hampshire Councty Council, said the project was designed to "protect people and property".
The first phase involved improving and widening ditches downstream of the village and installing larger pipes under properties.
The works are due to be complete in Spring 2016.
