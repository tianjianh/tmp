[SN]TITLE[SN]
Lowestoft's Marina Theatre extends its premises

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A Suffolk seaside theatre is to extend its premises into a neighbouring building to provide a cafe.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Marina Theatre, which was taken over by a charitable trust last December, is leasing the former Zenith call centre.
The trust which runs the venue said it will now be able to provide a bar and catering, new office space and better access for loading.
The theatre needs to raise £100,000 to join the two buildings together.
The lease of the new building will treble the amount of ground floor space the venue has and the box office will be moved.
Martin Halliday, chief executive of the Marina Theatre Trust, said: "It's going to be a lot easier for patrons to get in and out, have a coffee during the day and food before a show in the evening which is something that we've been wanting to do for many years.
"It is our wish to join the two properties together as soon as possible and we hope both the public and local businesses will be able to assist and we are announcing our Next Stage Appeal."
The Marina is currently closed for a £250,000 refurbishment of its 750-seat auditorium.
It is due to re-open on 14 September with a show by the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra, which has had a residency at the venue since 2005.
