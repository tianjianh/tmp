North Wales Bowls Centre, Prestatyn, closed earlier this year when Clwyd Leisure Ltd went into administration.
But it was refurbished over the summer and Denbighshire council has announced it will reopen and run it from October.
Councillor Huw Jones said the revamped eight green centre said there was a great deal of public support to reopen the bowls centre.
"The bowls centre forms part of our vision for developing leisure facilities along the coast and we believe that the refurbishment of the bowls centre will be a catalyst for further investment by partners along the coast," he added.
