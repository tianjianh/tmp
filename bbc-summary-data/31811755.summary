It weighs 141,000 tonnes, can hold more than 3,500 passengers and is over 300 metres long.
It's the fifth time the Queen has had the honour of naming a cruise ship.
She's previously christened the Royal Yacht Britannia and four cruise ships: Queen Elizabeth II, Oriana, Queen Mary II and the Queen Elizabeth.
But have you ever thought about how a ship gets its name?
Many big boats are named by the firms that make them, others can be named by the Queen or other VIPs. Martin's got more.
