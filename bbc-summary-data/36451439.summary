Many dressed up as her characters, with copies of Woman's Weekly, remembered for its "beat me on the bottom" mention in The Ballad of Barry and Freda.
The event also raised money for a children's music therapy charity, of which Victoria Wood was a patron.
The Prestwich-born comedian died in April from cancer at the age of 62.
Manchester Lesbian & Gay Chorus performed their own version of the famous ballad and the city's new Lord Mayor also paid tribute.
Actor Sue Devaney, who starred in the TV series Dinnerladies alongside the comedian, said "she brought so much joy to people's lives".
