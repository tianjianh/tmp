'City beach' plan for Swansea seafront

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Developers bidding for the Â£500m transformation of Swansea city centre aim to turn the seafront into a "city beach" to attract thousands of tourists.

The plans involve "exploiting" the area from the Marriott Hotel to beyond the civic centre with restaurants, bars and a 5* hotel on the beachfront.
An aquarium has previously been mooted for research by Swansea University and will also be open to tourists.
A developer will be chosen in November.
Swansea council will not reveal details of what the five bidders have submitted but the idea is to link the city centre to the beach.
However, it is understood the city beach would eclipse what is on offer at Mermaid Quay in Cardiff Bay 40 miles away.
The council wants the current civic centre site, which is up for sale, to have public spaces, tourist attractions and homes.
There would also be a walkway over the main road leading to the former St David's shopping centre site, which would house a retail and leisure complex.
Council leader Rob Stewart hinted at a city beach on Wednesday during an event held for businesses.
"It would provide a new city space," he said.
