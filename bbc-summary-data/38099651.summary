[SN]TITLE[SN]
Newark teacher Clare Hughes banned for selling stolen books

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A Nottinghamshire assistant head teacher who was convicted for selling textbooks that she had stolen has been banned from teaching for life.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Clare Hughes stole books worth more than £27,000 while working at Magnus Church of England Academy in Newark.
The 41-year-old was given a two-year suspended jail sentence at Nottingham Crown Court in June.
In a report, the teaching panel said Hughes committed "serious offences involving dishonesty" over three years.
Hughes, of Crown Street, Newark, sold the stolen books online between 2012 and 2015.
She raised about £5,000 by selling them.
She had blamed stress, but the judge said in June she "abused the trust placed in her".  She admitted five counts of theft.
Hughes, who earned £58,000 a year, had taught history at the school for 10 years.
The National College of Teaching and Leadership panel said the immediate ban was "proportionate" and "appropriate".
"The conduct of Ms Hughes fell significantly short of the standards expected of the profession," it stated.
"Her conviction for such serious offences involving dishonesty was a significant factor in forming that opinion."
Jayne Millions, of the Department for Education, struck her off "indefinitely" and " without a review period."
"In view of the seriousness of the allegations found proved against her, I have decided that Ms Hughes shall not be entitled to apply for restoration of her eligibility to teach," she said.
Hughes has a right of appeal to the High Court.
