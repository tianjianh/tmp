[SN]TITLE[SN]
Girl, 7, awarded £10m in damages from King's College Hospital Trust

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A seven-year-old girl whose mind is "trapped in a body" that will not do as she wants has been awarded £10.1m.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Eva Totham, from south-east London, was starved of oxygen at birth in 2007 and has severe cerebral palsy.
King's College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust accepted liability for her serious brain injuries.
The compensation covers Eva's past and future care and loss of earnings after it was ruled she would most likely have gone to university.
Mrs Justice Elisabeth Laing, at the High Court, said: "Eva is a beautiful, engaging child. She is determined and concentrates hard on any given activity.
"I had a strong sense of an energetic, inquisitive mind trapped in a body that will not do what Eva would wish it could do."
The trust agreed compensation for the majority of the items claimed but disputed the £1.4m set aside for pain, suffering and loss of enjoyment of life.
In her ruling, Justice Laing said that Eva, who goes to a mainstream primary school, found it hard to get around without help.
She said:  "I am satisfied, on the balance of probabilities, that Eva is beginning to be aware of the limitations which her injuries now impose.
"And that that realisation will be an increasing source of frustration and perhaps unhappiness."
Speaking after the judgment, which concluded the six-year case, the family's solicitor, Agata Usewicz, said the case was "not about money" but about "securing justice".
She said: "No amount of money will ever compensate for the injuries Eva has sustained, but this award will ensure that she is provided with the care she needs for the rest of her life."
