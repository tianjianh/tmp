[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Middlesbrough will hope to have Gaston Ramirez available after he missed the defeat at Hull with an ankle problem.

Defender Fabio misses a second successive match because of concussion, while Calum Chambers and George Friend have both been ruled out again.
Burnley will make a late decision on midfielder Steven Defour, who suffered a thigh injury in the win over Stoke.
Johann Berg Gudmundsson has returned to full training after a knee problem but won't be involved this weekend.
Martin Fisher: "After Wednesday's defeat at fellow strugglers Hull City, I thought this was a game Middlesbrough had to win.
"After checking their remaining fixtures, I'm now convinced victory is absolutely vital.
"You see, Boro still have to play Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester City and Arsenal.
"Seven points adrift of safety and without a win since Christmas, things are looking desperate, but a home game against Burnley might just provide a much-needed chink of light.
"The Clarets' away record is easily the worst in the Premier League.
"On paper, it's the perfect chance for Boro to inject fresh hope into their survival bid. Fail to grab it and the fat lady can start warming up in the wings."

Middlesbrough head coach Steve Agnew: "We know where we are - we have to set up to win the game.
"I think they understand the importance of game, what we have to do tomorrow is carry out the game plan.
"If we do that and remain stable in terms of the game plan and see that through then I'm very confident."
Burnley manager Sean Dyche on Middlesbrough: "Every game is a tough game. They have had a change of manager, whatever that brings. Good, bad or indifferent, we are yet to see.
"It looks like a change of tactical shape with two centre forwards. Maybe they are looking at a different view. Who knows? We have just got to be ready to deliver and take another challenge on."
The home fans will want to see Middlesbrough having a go after a season of safety-first football under Aitor Karanka.
Will it work? I am not sure. It might actually play into Burnley's hands a little bit.
I've said before that I don't see Sean Dyche's side going the whole campaign without winning away - and I think they will get that elusive victory here.
