Cash to preserve York's medieval city walls

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Preservation work costing Â£1.5m is to be carried out on some of the best preserved medieval city walls in England.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
York's city walls run for 2.1 miles (3.4km) and include five main bars (gateways) and 45 towers.
The current walls were largely built in the 13th and 14th centuries but include remains from earlier periods.
The council spends Â£100,000 a year on maintenance but said the additional funds were needed for major repairs.

The money will fund a five-year programme of works due to begin this year.
The work will include replacing steps at Monk Bar, improvement works at Micklegate Bar and repairs and restoration work at a number of the towers.
Councillor David Carr, Conservative leader of City of York Council, said: "York's city walls are the most complete and finest in England, making them one of our most treasured and significant historical assets.
"This is why it's so important we continue to invest in preserving and protecting them."
