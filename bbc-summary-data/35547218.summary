Agriculture Minister Joyce was elected leader of the Nationals party unopposed in a ballot in Canberra on Thursday.
Mr Joyce made headlines last year when he threatened to put down actor Johnny Depp's dogs after they were brought to Australia illegally.
He described the promotion as an "awesome responsibility", and vowed to fight for regional Australia.
"People in the weatherboard and iron, people in the brick and tile, those on the farm, those on the coast, who are saying these are the people that we have an expectation will represent us," he said.
Mr Joyce was born in the country town of Tamworth and worked as an accountant before entering politics.
Assistant Health Minister Nash will be elevated to deputy Nationals leader.
A ministerial cabinet reshuffle is expected in coming days.
