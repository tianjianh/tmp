Ajmal Shahzad: Sussex part company with former England fast bowler

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Sussex have parted company with former England fast bowler Ajmal Shahzad by mutual agreement.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Former Yorkshire, Lancashire and Nottinghamshire paceman Shahzad, 31, is "free to explore other playing opportunities with immediate effect".
He joined Sussex in 2015 on a two-year deal after leaving Nottinghamshire.
Shahzad played one Test match for England in 2010 against Bangladesh and has also featured in 11 one-dayers and three T20 internationals.
"I think it's clear that myself and the club are going in different directions and it suits both parties to part ways," he said in a statement.
"Ajmal's attitude has always been exemplary and he's been a great role model for the youngsters at the club," Sussex director of cricket Keith Greenfield said.
"But we recognise he wants and needs to be playing first-team cricket and he will hopefully get an opportunity at another county where he can show his worth."
