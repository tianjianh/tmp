Lewis Ball, 26, has not been seen since he left the Thekla on Bristol's Floating Harbour at 03:20 GMT on Sunday 5 February.
His brother Alex said: "It's not like Lewis at all, so you're just thinking about all the worst things."
Police said efforts to find Lewis "continue unabated".
Officers traced three people who left the nightclub at the same time as him, but they were unable to provide any information as to his whereabouts.
Mr Ball said: "They remember Lewis and they remember talking with him, but they just left him in the car park. That's all they could tell us."
He said his family is struggling to cope, and he has put posters up round the city centre and handed out leaflets at the venue as part of the search.
"You just have to keep in your mind that he's safe," he added.
Avon and Somerset Police is urging anyone who has information to contact the force.
Drivers have also been asked to check their dashcam footage if they were in the area at the time.
Lewis is described as white, 5ft 9ins tall and of slim build.
When he went missing he was wearing a black jumper, black skinny jeans and brown ankle boots.
