So we couldn't resist showing you this newborn polar bear cub and his sleeping mum, Giovannia.
The healthy cub was born at Munich Zoo in Germany but mother and bear baby will be staying snuggled up until after winter.
Then they will emerge and members of the public will be able to see the new arrival.
Watch the video to catch a sneak peak of the sleepy bears.
