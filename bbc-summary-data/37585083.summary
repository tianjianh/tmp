Police believe the robbery, at the house on South Beach Road, happened between 10:20 and 11:30 on Monday.
The theft was discovered and reported by the home owner who is said to be "absolutely distraught" at the loss.
Police believe the break-in was "a crime of opportunity" and are not linking it to similar incidents in the area. They have appealed for witnesses.
PC Bryn Meehan, who is leading on the investigation, said: "From our inquiries so far, it seems this was a crime of opportunity which has left the home owner absolutely distraught.
"We have been conducting door-to-door interviews and assessing opportunities to capture any available CCTV.
"At this time I would ask the residents of Troon to contact us with any information they may have."
He added: "If you have noticed any person acting suspiciously or vehicles in the area prior to the incident then please get in touch."
