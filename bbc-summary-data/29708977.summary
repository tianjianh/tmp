His comments came during questions to UK Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt in the House of Commons on Tuesday.

The Welsh government has denied claims that thousands of patients in Wales were "desperately" seeking treatment in England.
Mr Davies asked Mr Hunt if any English patients had asked him for treatment in Wales.
