Meningitis B: NI Private hospitals see vaccine inquiries rise

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Private hospitals in Northern Ireland are reporting an increase in the number of inquiries from the public about getting the Meningitis B vaccine.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
One private hospital told the BBC that 90 people are on a waiting list after it ran out of supplies last week.
Hundreds of thousands of people have signed a national petition for the jab to be offered to all children
It follows a case in England where a mother shared pictures of her daughter dying in hospital from the illness.
Under national guidelines, the vaccine is only available to babies.
All babies in the UK are offered a potentially life-saving vaccine against meningitis B as part of a national immunisation programme.
However, there have been calls for the age limit to be extended to children and teenagers.
