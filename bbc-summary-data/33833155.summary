[SN]TITLE[SN]
SAS selection test 'to be softened'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Recruitment tests to join the SAS will be "softened" in response to the deaths of three reservists during a selection march, the Times has claimed.

The newspaper says test marches in the Brecon Beacons could be postponed in the case of extreme temperatures, humidity and winds.
The decision has angered SAS insiders and their US counterparts who fear it may lower standards, the paper claimed.
The Ministry of Defence has not commented on the story.
At an inquest last month, the Ministry of Defence was severely criticised for the planning and conduct of a 16-mile march which resulted in the deaths of three soldiers.
L/Cpl Craig Roberts, L/Cpl Edward Maher and Cpl James Dunsby all collapsed and died after overheating on a Brecon Beacons exercise on one of the hottest days of 2013.
The MoD apologised and said changes to the SAS recruitment test were under way.
Changes will include more water stations along the route and a "weather test" which would allow the hike to be postponed if conditions are too hot, the Times reported.
It also said would-be SAS members would be allowed practice sessions allowing them to become accustomed to the terrain.
It claims there is a fear within the SAS of a lowering of standards, and quotes a former officer who says there is a feeling that selection is being made "softer and easier".
Professor George Havenith, a specialist in environmental physiology and ergonomics who gave evidence at the inquest, told the BBC the special forces needed a "culture change" so existing rules were followed, rather than new guidelines.
