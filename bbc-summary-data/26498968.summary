Ravel Morrison is the best footballer since Paul Gascoigne, according to Birmingham manager Lee Clark.

Morrison, on loan at QPR from West Ham, scored both goals to secure his team's 2-0 win at Birmingham.
The 21-year-old spent last season on loan at St Andrew's under Clark, who is disappointed that Morrison looks unlikely to make Roy Hodgson's England's World Cup squad.
"He is the best footballer since Paul Gascoigne," Clark said.
Former Newcastle, Tottenham, Lazio, Rangers, Middlesbrough and Everton midfielder Gascoigne, who won 57 England caps and retired in 2004, is renowned as one of his country's best ever players.
Clark added: "If Paul Gascoigne had not done his knee he would have become the best player in the world.
"I played with Paul. I grew up with Paul. The only thing is that Ravel doesn't know who Paul Gascoigne is!
"[Morrison] has the pace of a wide-man. He has the balance but plays in the middle of the pitch because he can manoeuvre the ball."
Clark feels that it is only England U21 international Morrison's attitude that is holding him back.
The Birmingham manager thinks that working with Harry Redknapp will help bring the best out of Morrison, who joined QPR on loan for the rest of the season in February.
He said: "Ravel can score goals, as we have seen. It is what is between the ears with him and he knows about this problem.
"He now has a perfect manager because Harry Redknapp loves those type of players. Ravel can change games and I thought he was a class act against Birmingham.
"I was hoping that he would continue doing it for West Ham because I would love to see him on that plane to Brazil.
"He would certainly be capable of doing something for England coming off the bench for 10 minutes in any environment."
