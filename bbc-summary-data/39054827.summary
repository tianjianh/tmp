Front-rowers Ben Moon, Carl Rimmer and Shaun Malton have all extended their contracts at Exeter Chiefs.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Prop Moon, 27, who helped Chiefs win promotion to the Premiership in 2010 and has since made 120 top-flight appearances, signs a three-year deal.
Fellow prop Rimmer, 30, has penned a two-year contract, having played 15 times this season.
Hooker Malton, 27, signs a one-year deal after his first Exeter Premiership start, against Worcester on Saturday.
"All of the re-signings we're making at the moment, we genuinely see them as good players," head coach Rob Baxter told BBC Radio Devon.
"They've all done well in the Premiership and European competition, and yet we still see us and them individually progressing."
