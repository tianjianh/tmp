The English top seed, who won the 2013 title, won 11-3 11-6 11-3 and will face Egyptian sixth seed Omneya Abdel Kawy in the last eight.
Massaro, 32, is into her fifth straight World Championship quarter-final.
Second seed and eight-time champion Nicol David of Malaysia beat England's Alison Waters 11-9 11-3 11-5.
"It was just about trying to get out and start strong, keep my intensity quite high," Massaro told the PSA World Tour.
"I think I probably set a record for the amount of fist pumps considering the length of time that I was on court for.
"I was making sure that I was there for the entire match and that I didn't let her get up at any point."
Sarah-Jane Perry of England was beaten 11-5 11-7 11-6 by French fourth seed Camille Serme.
