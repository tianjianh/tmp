The 28-year-old joined Gloucester from Cornish Pirates in 2009.
He has made 17 appearances so far this season for David Humphreys' side, who are eighth in the table.
"To sign on again was a really easy decision," Dawidiuk told the club website. "The challenge for me now is to keep working hard, pushing on and being a key part of the team."
