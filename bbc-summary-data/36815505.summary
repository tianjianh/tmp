The Bridgend-bred player was part of Great Britain's initial 25-man training squad for the Games but damaged the anterior cruciate ligament in his right knee playing for GB Royals last week.
"I still can't believe it to be honest. I went from such a high to rock bottom in the blink of an eye," said Morgan.
GB coach Simon Amor will finalise his 12-strong squad on July 19.
