[SN]TITLE[SN]
Minister Francis Maude to stand down as Horsham MP

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Cabinet Office minister Francis Maude has announced he is to stand down at the next election, 32 years after entering parliament.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The MP for Horsham in West Sussex said it was "time to make way for a younger candidate".
Mr Maude held ministerial positions in the cabinets of Margaret Thatcher and John Major as well as David Cameron.
He won his seat in the 2010 general election, defeating the Liberal Democrats, with a majority of 11,460.
In a letter to the Horsham Conservative Association, he said: "I was first elected to the House of Commons in 1983 just before I was 30, and will be nearly 67 by the time of the election in 2020.
"However, 27 years is a long time to serve as a member of parliament, and I believe now is the right time to make way for a younger candidate to carry the Conservative flag in Horsham."
Mr Maude was elected to the House of Commons in 1983 as MP for North Warwickshire, where he served until 1992.
After five years out of office he returned as MP for Horsham in 1997, which he has represented since.
