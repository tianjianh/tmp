[SN]TITLE[SN]

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A vicar's son who asked a teenage girl to perform a sex act with a dog while online at his father's vicarage has been jailed for a year.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Noah Yabbacome, 24, was arrested after police raided the St Nicholas Vicarage in Lincoln where his father David was the parish vicar.
Police found over 800 indecent images of children together with "extreme" photographs depicting bestiality.
Officers acted in February 2013 after learning of Yabbacome's activities.
Lincoln Crown Court heard that police found evidence from chat log entries which showed that he made contact with someone he thought was a 15-year-old girl and encouraged her to have sex with her pet dog.
Officers were unable to trace the person in question, and therefore were unable to verify if Yabbacome had indeed been chatting to a girl.
While on bail he downloaded further illegal images on a borrowed device but was reported when the owner was given it back.
Yabbacome, who now lives in Vicarage Close, Collingham, Nottinghamshire, admitted two charges of attempting to incite a child to engage in sexual activity and a string of offences relating to indecent images of children and extreme images.
Judge John Pini QC told him: "The public view this sort of offending with horror and justifiably so.
"These images involve actual physical contact with real girls which resulted in serious sexual abuse of very young children causing incalculable harm."
Det Sgt Vicky Midgley, of the police internet child abuse team, said: "Some of the detail officers have had to consider as part of the investigation is amongst the most hideously graphic I have seen."
Yabbacome, described as a "depraved individual", was also given a 10-year sexual harm prevention order, designed to control his behaviour when he is released.
