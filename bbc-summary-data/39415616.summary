Romeo and his classmates had their photos taken and were given special badges.
Romeo got to sit in the cab of the truck and pull the horn. He even went for a ride.
"I just thought it would be normal to put a normal Romeo picture on Facebook," Romeo's dad Charlie Makaveli said.
"I didn't think it would go quite as far. I don't think he quite understands how big it's become. He just brushes it aside and just gets on with his day."
