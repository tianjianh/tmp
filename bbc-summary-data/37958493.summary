[SN]TITLE[SN]
Ipswich Town 0-2 Nottingham Forest

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Nottingham Forest's Britt Assombalonga scored his first of two goals after just 17 seconds to lead his side to a Championship win at struggling Ipswich.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The striker latched onto Ben Osborn's through ball to slot home the fastest goal in the second tier this season.
Assombalonga's close-range header made it 2-0 on the stroke of half-time.
Despite Ipswich piling forward after the break, Pajtim Kasami almost added a third for Forest but his fierce strike hit the outside of the post.
The defeat puts the pressure back on Ipswich boss Mick McCarthy following their 2-1 victory at Sheffield Wednesday two weeks earlier, with the Suffolk side's lack of potency in front of goal returning.
The Tractor Boys, who lost prolific striker Daryl Murphy to Newcastle in August, have only scored 14 goals in 17 league games, the joint-lowest in the division alongside Wigan.
Assombalonga, who missed much of last season with a serious knee injury, showed the clinical touch the hosts lacked, finishing low into the bottom corner almost straight from the kick-off.
David McGoldrick had Ipswich's best chance, but his curling first-half effort from 12 yards was tipped wide by Vladimir Stojkovic.
And moments later Assombalonga pounced on hesitant defending to score his sixth goal in eight Championship appearances.
Ipswich were more attacking in the second half and Tom Lawrence had two penalty appeals waved away, but a Forest defence which has conceded 30 goals this season held firm for their first clean sheet of the season.
