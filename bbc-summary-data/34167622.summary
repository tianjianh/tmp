Australia all-rounder Shane Watson has retired from Test cricket after a calf injury cut short his involvement in the tour of England.

The 34-year-old played in 59 Test matches, scoring 3,731 runs at an average of 35.19 and taking 75 wickets at 33.68.
Having made his debut in 2005, he has played in five Ashes series, including this summer's 3-2 defeat by England.
"I just know it's the right time to move on," said Watson.
"I don't have that real fight in me, especially for Test cricket, knowing the lengths physically that I'd have to go through, mentally and technically as well, to be at my best in Test cricket.
"I've been through a lot of different waves of emotion about what is right for myself, my family and most importantly the team as well.
"Over the last couple of days there was a lot of clarity of what the right decision was. I've given everything I possibly can to get the best out of myself.
"I'm hopefully not moving on forever, still able to play some one-day and Twenty20 cricket for Australia as well."
His injury came in Saturday's 64-run win at Lord's, which gave Australia a 2-0 lead after two matches of the five-game one-day series.
A two-time Ashes winner, Watson was dropped after one Test of this summer's series following a run of poor form that had seen him reach a half-century only 11 times in 62 innings since the start of 2011.
Before that, Watson had scored 1,373 runs in 14 matches at an average of 52.81, culminating in him being named Test player of the year.
A powerful batsman who has operated in several positions in the batting order, Watson scored four Test centuries - including a top score of 176, which came against England at The Oval in 2013.
Watson also courted controversy when he left the tour of India in 2013 after being one of four players dropped for the third Test for failing to deliver feedback on how the team could improve, as requested by then coach Mickey Arthur.
