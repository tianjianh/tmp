[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Two men who killed a pedestrian in a "madcap" hit-and-run car crash have each been jailed for eight years.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
James Gilbey, 25, died after he was hit by a car, which failed to stop, while he was crossing Stanningley Bypass in Leeds on 13 July.
Majid Malik admitted causing death by dangerous driving. Kaiz Mahmood was found guilty of the same offence after a trial at Leeds Crown Court.
The pair were racing in separate cars on the road at the time of the crash.
The court heard they had used Stanningley Bypass as a race track in which Malik, 28, of Silverhill Avenue, Bradford, and Mahmood, 28, of Hinchcliffe Street, Bradford, reached speeds of nearly 80mph.
Mr Gilbey, from Bramley, Leeds, died at the scene from multiple injuries when Malik's car struck him.
While Mahmood's car did not hit the pedestrian, he was found equally culpable for causing his untimely death.
Judge James Spencer QC described the racing as "madcap" and said to them: "When you did see the hapless Mr Gilbey, you, Malik, couldn't stop in time and you, Mahmood, was so close there was splashes of blood on your car.
"Neither of you had the guts to stay.
"You drove away and didn't resurface again for at least 24 hours, by which time if there had been any suggestion of drink it was impossible to trace."
Mr Gilbey's father, Richard, said his son had been "cheated" of the prospect of a marriage, children and a future.
Speaking outside the court after the pair were sentenced, he said: "[James] asked for very little in life but the one thing he did ask for was the most simple of basic human rights, and that was that right to be able to walk home safely.
"Losing James has destroyed us as a family. He's lost his life, we've lost our son, a brother and people have lost a dear friend. And we will never truly experience happy times again."
