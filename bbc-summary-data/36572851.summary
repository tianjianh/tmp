Wales must remain bold in attack against the All Blacks on Saturday as they look to avoid a series whitewash in New Zealand, says hooker Ken Owens.

The world champions' 36-22 win in Wellington means Steve Hansen's side have an unassailable 2-0 lead going into the final Test in Dunedin.
Wales have adopted a more expansive approach in New Zealand as they try to evolve their game.
"We've got to keep working at it and keep being bold and brave," said Owens.
"We've played some good stuff on this tour so far and we've just got to keep our heads up and keep plugging away.
"There's still one game to go and hopefully we can get a result."

Wales finished second behind a rejuvenated England in the 2016 Six Nations, and came in for criticism at home for their style of play during the championship.
But Warren Gatland's side have added more variety to their game in New Zealand as they look to be more expansive and have scored five tries in their two defeats by the All Blacks so far.
"You've got to try it sometime. We've been criticised for having one style of play and we've worked hard since the Six Nations and during the Six Nations to evolve and adapt our game and I think we've done that," said Owens.
Wales led the first Test after an hour in Auckland after tries from Taulupe Faletau and Rhys Webb, only for Hansen's men to score 21 unanswered points on their way to a 39-21 victory.
In Wellington, the visitors finished on a high with Liam Williams and Jonathan Davies scoring late on to ensure Wales only lost by 14 points - the narrowest losing margin they have ever achieved against the All Blacks in New Zealand.
Wales have now lost 28 consecutive matches against the All Blacks, with their last win coming in 1953.
But captain Sam Warburton says Wales must continue with their expansive approach.
"I think the one big learning point we've got from this is that our attack is better than we think it is," he said.
"We should back ourselves more often. I think we were guilty in the Six Nations of perhaps playing a little bit too conservatively. The Six Nations is a little bit more chess than when you play the southern hemisphere teams.
"We need to back our attack because we are comfortable with ball in hand.
"We just need to show that a little bit more often so I think that's the big learning we'll take back."
