Prince Charles visits pupils and medics in Merthyr Tydfil

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Prince of Wales has been visiting south Wales to see how teachers are helping inspire pupils on one of Wales' most deprived housing estates.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Prince Charles went to Pen-y-Dre High School at Gurnos in Merthyr Tydfil, where some of its teachers are part of the Teach First initiative.
The prince is patron of the charity, which aims to train teachers to become "inspirational classroom leaders".
He then went to meet medics at the Keir Hardie University Health Park.
Opened in 2012, the Â£35m facility hosts health and social care services along with an academic centre.
"This teaching facility reaches out to medical students in the first two years of their medical training," said Dr Christopher Jones, Chairman of Cwm Taf University Health Board.
"It opens a window for them to experience in their formative years the needs, values and joy of serving our Welsh valley communities.
"On behalf of all our partners we are delighted to welcome His Royal Highness to this world class facility."
