Images ranging from a misty morning in the Peak District to sunset over the heather-strewn North York Moors are some of the winning shots from the Landscape Photographer of the Year awards.

Entered by thousands from around the UK, an image of a small stream created by heavy rain among the vast Glencoe mountains took the overall winning title.
A Beginning and an End captures a "fleeting moment of beauty" in the Scottish Highlands by photographer Mark Littlejohn from Penrith, Cumbria.
Mr Littlejohn said he got up at 01:30 GMT to drive to Glencoe but the rain had been torrential at dawn.
As he wandered about waiting for gaps in the weather, he saw the stream from high up on Gearr Aonach.
He said: "It tumbled steeply down the slopes before vanishing again near the base of the mountain.
"With more squalls coming through I decided to take this image as the light became slightly more diffuse. It had to be a quick handheld shot due to the sideways rain."
Founder of the awards Charlie Waite, said Mr Littlejohn's image discovered and isolated a "fleeting moment of beauty" within a vast and "slightly threatening" arena.
Other winning shots ranged from a close-up of a lichen-covered rowan tree to cityscapes dominated by striking buildings.
The Young Photographer of the Year category was won by Sam Rielly, 17, from London, for his black and white image of his mother walking through the landscape of Anglesey.
He said: "This image was taken on a particularly wet and windy day on Parys Mountain, the site of a former copper mine.
"The subject of the image is my mother, who was unaware that I was taking the picture."
The awards, held in association with VisitBritain, included a category for an image that would encourage people to visit Britain.
John Robinson, from Peterlee, County Durham, won this category for his shot of sunset over the heather-strewn Yorkshire Moors.
The winning entries will be on display at Waterloo station in London from 1 December.
