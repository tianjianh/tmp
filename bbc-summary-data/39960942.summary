Purr-cel force: The rude post office cat with global fan base

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A "grumpy" cat who has been a feature at a post office for 22 years is to "retire" when the service moves to new premises.

Flash sits on the counter of Lochinver Post Office and is well-known to local customers and visitors to the area.
While popular with the shoppers, Flash rudely sits with his back to them, says owner and post mistress Ann Macleod.
The Highlands post office is moving to a local supermarket from the building it has occupied since 1896.
Only two families have run the business.
Ms Macleod has had the post office for 23 years and said the move was in line with what other rural post offices have been doing to help extend hours and services.
Flash will not be moving and is "retiring" to the comfort of his owner's home full-time. His and the post office's last day in the old building will be on Friday.
Ms Macleod told BBC Alba: "We are probably the last office in Sutherland being moved into a supermarket.
"It will be all change but we will get used to it."
On Flash, she said: "He sits with his back to people. He's very rude."
But she added: "We'll probably have to have a visitation day for people to come and see him because he's got that many followers all over the world."
