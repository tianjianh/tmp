[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 31-year-old has moved to Sixfields on a free transfer after making 26 appearances for the Shakers last term.
Ex-Luton, West Brom and Wigan defender Barnett has played more than 300 senior matches and has signed following the departures of Zander Diamond, Gabriel Zakuani and Rod McDonald.
"Northampton are a team going forward," Barnett told BBC Radio Northampton.
"I think (manager Justin Edinburgh) is trying to bring more experience at the back, that physical presence and hopefully I can bring that to the team and help them push up the table."
