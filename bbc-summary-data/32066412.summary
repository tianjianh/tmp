The 34-year-old tight-head retired from international rugby in January, having won 95 caps for his country and four Six Nations titles.
It will be a first foray into the English game for the former British and Irish Lions man.
Jones started at Neath before spending 11 years with Ospreys, and signed for Blues in August 2014.
"He is a world-class prop and we cannot wait to get him involved," said director of rugby Conor O'Shea, whose Quins side are currently eighth in the Premiership table.
"Not only is it apparent that Adam wants to keep going for some time to come, but the work he will do in supporting and pushing our young tight-heads Kyle Sinckler, Will Collier and Matt Shields will benefit us for years to come."
Jones joined Swansea-based Ospreys when the region was formed in 2003 and won four Celtic League titles with the club.
The Abercrave-born front-rower has competed at the last three World Cups and was part of the Lions tours to South Africa in 2009 and Australia four years later.
However, he announced his decision to quit international rugby earlier this year after failing to make Warren Gatland's Six Nations squad.
"I'm really excited about this new challenge," said Jones. "Contrary to media reports in Wales, I have had options here, but Harlequins is an ambitious and progressive club with good values.
"Everyone who is there, or who has been there, loves it and having spoken to both Conor O'Shea and John Kingston I was even more impressed."
