Daley totalled 507.95 from his six routines to finish ahead of Matty Lee (428.00) and Noah Williams (389.05).
"There were a lot of positives and I'm happy how my dives are progressing," the 22-year-old told BBC Sport.
Scotland's Grace Reid will also expect to be named in the Team GB line-up after winning the 3m springboard title.
Daley made his Olympic debut at the 2008 Beijing Games when he was just 14, before winning bronze at London 2012.
Assuming he attains a place at this summer's Rio Games, Daley believes the event could represent his best chance yet of securing Olympic gold.

"My consistency has certainly gone up over the last 12 months, particularly with the new dive," said the Devon-born diver.
"Every time I go into competition, I'm getting more confident of getting the big scores, which is what I'll need if I'm to challenge for an Olympic gold medal."
Reid has enjoyed an impressive year, which began by securing Britain a place in the women's individual 3m event at the Rio Olympic test event in February.
She then became the first Scottish diver to gain an individual European medal for 62 years with a bronze in London last month.
The 20-year-old, who is based in Edinburgh, also earned European gold alongside Tom Daley in the non-Olympic mixed synchronised 3m springboard event.
"It's just amazing and I'm really pleased not only with the result today but also the new consistency that I've found," Reid told BBC Sport.
"I was in emotional trauma if I'm honest (with the pressure today), but I was able to find my composure and hopefully it's enough for Rio because that would mean everything."
British divers will learn whether they have been selected to represent Team GB at the Rio Olympics later this week.
