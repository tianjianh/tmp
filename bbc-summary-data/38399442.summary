The 24-year-old Australian will join relegated Rovers from St George Illawarra ahead of the 2017 season.
"It came as a bit of a shock to me to hear they had been relegated but from what I've heard I think we've got what it takes to bounce back," he said.
Hull KR head coach Tim Sheens added: "Adam's speed will be really important for us as well as his experience out the back."
