[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Shrewsbury climbed out of the League One relegation zone with victory against Rochdale.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
On-loan Barnsley striker Stefan Payne's first goal for Shrewsbury was enough to earn Paul Hurst's side a first win since 28 February.
Payne struck in the 16th minute when he broke into the box and clinically fired a low shot past advancing goalkeeper Conrad Logan.
Midfielder Bryn Morris twice went close for the hosts either side of the goal, driving wide from 20 yards and then hammering a powerful shot from just inside the penalty area narrowly over the bar.
Rochdale carried little first-half threat, with a free-kick from Nathaniel Mendez-Laing which cleared the bar, their only notable effort.
Shaun Whalley lifted a free-kick over for the hosts in the second half while Junior Brown and substitute Stephen Humphrys both flashed efforts just off target.
Rochdale's Keith Keane drilled a 20-yard shot wide for the visitors as Shrewsbury boosted their battle to beat the drop.
