[SN]TITLE[SN]
Coins and rings declared as treasure by coroner in Cardiff

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Gold coins and rings found by metal detectors are among eight items declared as treasure by the coroner in Cardiff.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Among the finds was a medieval hoard of 17 coins discovered by Roland Mumford in December 2012, while metal detecting on farm land in Wenvoe in the Vale of Glamorgan.
The oldest coin is a penny of Edward I from the 1290s.
Another series of  bronze artefacts is thought to be late Bronze Age.
The hoard of coins consisted of five gold and 12 silver coins and included a half-noble, four quarter-nobles of Edward III (1327-77) and, principally, groats (4d pieces) of Edward III.
The collection is thought to date to around 1365-1370.
The hoard of two bronze artefacts was identified as a complete socketed axe of ribbed Croxton type and a fragment of a socketed axe of ribbed South Wales type.
They were discovered in Llancarfany, in the Vale of Glamorgan, by David Harrison.
The artefacts were found together in October 2013 while Mr Harrison was metal detecting on farm land.
