Supporters of the charity were urged by a former patient to send donations and festive greetings to the pilot, doctor and paramedic on a bauble-shaped card.
Nearly 600 cards now adorn a Christmas tree at its Marden base, in Kent, after the appeal was launched by Liz James.
The charity, which is celebrating its 25th anniversary, also received a total of £17,448 in donations.
Ms James, from East Grinstead, said the air ambulance had "undoubtedly helped to save my life" after she was involved in a road traffic accident.
So far this year, the air ambulance has attended more than 2,100 callouts.
