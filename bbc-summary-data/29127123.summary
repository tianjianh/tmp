The jobs are in technology, finance and consulting with average salaries set at around Â£30,000.
Invest NI is providing about Â£2.5m in support.
The company plans to invest more than Â£30m over the next five years
It is the second significant announcement by the company in Northern Ireland within the past 18 months.
Senior partner, Jackie Henry, said it was a proud day.
"This significant investment tells the world in Northern Ireland we have the skills, the wherewithal and the ambition to succeed in globally competitive markets."
Ms Henry said that the support the company got from government was a key factor in the decision.
"The excellent performance of the Belfast Technology Studio since it was set up in 2011, together with the support from government, made Northern Ireland stand out as the best place to grow this aspect of our business."
The First Minister, Peter Robinson, welcomed the expansion.
"It is testament to the quality of the Northern Ireland workforce and the confidence that Deloitte has in Northern Ireland that this internationally renowned company has decided to not only expand once, but twice here."
The Deputy First Minister, Martin McGuinness, said it was a strong endorsement of the economy.
"These jobs demonstrate Deloitte's confidence that the north of Ireland is the best place to grow this sector of their business and is recognition of the hard work, dedication, skills and expertise of our workforce."
In May last year Deloitte said it was initially creating 177 jobs, but indicated that the workforce would be increased.
Deloitte offers a range of audit, tax, consulting and corporate finance services to clients across the public and private sectors from offices in the UK and the Republic of Ireland.
