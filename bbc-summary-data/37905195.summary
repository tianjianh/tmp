Forte struck midway through the first half, while Collins scored with the last kick of the match to up a home tie against Peterborough.
Graham Burke tested Grant Smith early on, with the Wood keeper getting down low to palm his stinging effort out for a corner. From the resultant kick, Adam Campbell's trickery got him into a shooting position, but he fired just wide.
Kenny Davis did well to deflect Stanley Aborah's shot wide, while at the other end, Anthony Jeffrey had the visitors' first sight of goal, curling a 20-yard effort over.
County took the lead when visiting defender Joe Devera misjudged the bounce of a pass and Forte nipped in to intercept before lashing the ball past goalkeeper Smith.
Genaro Snijders blasted wildly over from eight yards early in the second half, while visiting stopper Smith then made a sprawling low save from Campbell.
Bruno Andrade had a couple of chances for the visitors, but failed to test Adam Collin in the home goal, and just after Wood sub Jamie Lucas went close with a header, Collins cracked home a second goal deep into added time.
