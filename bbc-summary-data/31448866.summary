Chelsea midfielder Eden Hazard could become "one of the best players in the world" if he gets protection from referees, according to former Blues star Pat Nevin.

Hazard, 24, who has signed a new five-and-a-half-year contract at the club, is the most fouled player in the league this season, with opposing players being penalised 74 times.
"If he's going to last his five-and-a-half years he's got to get a bit more protection than he's getting just now," Nevin told BBC Sport.
"If he gets that then he could turn out to be one of the best players in the world. If he gets that, then he would be right on the coat-tails of Messi and Ronaldo."
The Belgium international has scored 13 times in 36 appearances this season and seen 28 opposing players booked for tackles against him.
"It's great news for the club. It looks as though he is going to now be a Chelsea player for the majority of the best part of his career and I for one am excited to keep watching him as a part of our game.
"Too often we are losing the best players out of the Premier League."
