Speaking to BBC Sport from Canada, where she is part of England's World Cup squad, Stoney said: "It's huge for women's football.
"Women in sport don't really get much recognition, so to get recognition in your area of sport, to get recognised for your services to the game, is really important because it's not just about me, it's about the players who played 25 to 30 years ago, who put me in this position to be able to go to a World Cup."
In rugby union, former England fly-half and Rugby World Cup winner Jonny Wilkinson becomes a CBE, while ex-Wales fly-half Jonathan Davies has been made an OBE for his work as president of Cardiff's Velindre Cancer Centre.

Head, 69, who co-founded Williams with Sir Frank Williams, helped the team claim nine constructor championships.
