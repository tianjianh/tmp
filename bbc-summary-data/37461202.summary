Felix Barrow sustained many broken bones and spent three weeks in a coma when he was knocked over outside his home in Swanmore in October last year.
His parents were told he might never walk again, but they said he has now exceeded all his doctors' expectations.
The family has raised nearly Â£100,000 for the services that saved his life.
Felix was on his way to school when he tripped in the road and was hit by a car as he was getting to his feet.
His mum Vanessa said the accident was "horrific" and added: "You just think this can't be happening to you.
"It was just a normal Wednesday, normal things going on, and your life is turned upside down into an unrecognisable sate where you are thrust into a hospital environment.
"At first I don't think we really realised the extent of his injuries.
"It's been a slow process of learning to do things again, learning to walk, learning to eat, drink normal fluids."
She added that her son has surpassed all expectations and made "amazing" progress.
Felix's dad Stuart said his life was saved by the Hampshire and Isle of Wight Air Ambulance, which flew him to hospital, and the Southampton General Paediatric Intensive Care Unit.
He said: "We wanted to repay them for saving his life. It's been fantastic, the whole community has come together."
The family set up a charity, Fit For Felix, inspired by his love of running and named by his friend Bradley.
It has now raised Â£93,850 by organising a range of activities including fun runs, bike rides, and sponsored swims.
