[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Nikki Collingbourne, 26, was found dead at her flat in Ivel Court, Letchworth, Hertfordshire, in May.
Yvonne Caylor, 53, is on trial at Luton Crown Court where she denies murder.
The court was played a police video of an interview with Ms Collingbourne who was questioned after Ms Caylor had complained she had been assaulted.
Six months later, Ms Caylor, of Grove Road, Hitchin, is said to have disguised herself as a man before going to Ms Collingbourne's flat and killing her.
The prosecution alleges the motive for the murder goes back to 3 October 2015 when Ms Collingbourne evicted Ms Caylor from the flat in Ivel Court.
Ms Caylor claimed Ms Collingbourne had assaulted her and, while the younger woman was in the custody of Hertfordshire Police, it is alleged Ms Caylor burgled the flat.
No action was taken against Ms Collingbourne, but Ms Caylor was charged and was due to stand trial accused of burglary and attempting to pervert the course of justice.
The case was in a "warned list" at Cambridge Crown Court starting on 23 May, the day of the alleged murder.
In the police interview on 4 October 2015, Ms Collingbourne said Ms Caylor had been staying with her, but was due to leave. On 3 October she said there was a confrontation in which Ms Caylor threw her iPad with force, smashing it to the floor.
Ms Collingbourne told an officer: "I was trying to keep calm. It became worse and worse. She was pinning me against a wall saying 'I am going to...  kill you.'
"I took her stuff to the front door. She got a mop. She said, 'I am going to ram this down your throat'. It fell on the floor."
Ms Collingbourne denied to the officers in the interview striking out at Ms Caylor or grabbing her by the neck.
The case continues.
