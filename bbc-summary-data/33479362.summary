Study shows Scots' disposable income

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The north-east is ahead of the Scottish capital in the latest assessment of disposable income across the country.

However, that was measured before the slump in oil prices, which has hit the Aberdeen and Aberdeenshire economy.
Glasgow was found to have the lowest amount of spending money per head, after tax and benefits, while the west Highlands and Ayrshire were the parts of Scotland relying most on benefits.
The findings are from a study by the Scottish Parliament Information Centre.
It showed that disposable income in Scotland in 2013 averaged £17,039. That compares with £17,599 for the whole UK.
In real terms, that has risen faster in Scotland, at 27%, than the UK as a whole, at 23%, in the 16 years to 2013.
In cash terms, excluding the effect of inflation, income was up 81% in Scotland over that period, and by 75% in the UK as a whole.
That shows the gap between Scotland's average income and that of the UK as a whole has narrowed since 1997.
The study also showed how that disposable income differs across Scotland. Only the north-east and Edinburgh were above £20,000 per head, putting those areas in the top 20% for the UK as a whole.
The areas with the lowest level of spending money per head were in west central Scotland, West Lothian and parts of Tayside.
The highest income areas were more than £5,000 per head better off than Glasgow and North Lanarkshire, which were in the bottom 25% for UK income.
Disposable income per head in Aberdeen and Aberdeenshire was 35% above Glasgow.
The analysis also went into the question of how much that ranking depends on social benefits, including pensions and welfare.
Of Scottish disposable income, 21% came from benefits, while the figure for the whole UK was just below 20%.
Areas with a high concentration of older people or with greater poverty are combined among the areas where most income comes from benefits.
The area with the highest share of income from benefits, at 28%, was a region that includes Lochaber, Skye and Lochalsh, Arran and Cumbrae along with Argyll and Bute.  That puts it in the top 10% of UK regions for reliance on benefits as income.
Another insight into Scottish income came this week from the Budget for Fiscal Responsibility, in a document released alongside the Budget at Westminster.
Using HM Revenue and Customs statistics, it split the 2012-13 income tax-paying population of Scotland, Wales and the UK into five segments, and showed how they differ in distribution.
The outcome showed Scotland is slightly more weighted towards the lower earning segments. But it is only in the share of those earning more than £150,000 that there was a big difference.
The difference between Welsh income distribution and that of the UK was much wider than Scotland's.
