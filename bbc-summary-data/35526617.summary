[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Oil giant ConocoPhillips has been fined £3m for allowing "600kgs of potentially explosive" gas to be leaked from a platform off the Lincolnshire coast.

About 66 people were put in danger when the gas was released from the company's offshore gas gathering system off Mablethorpe in November 2012.
At Lincoln Crown Court, Judge John Pini QC said at least seven people were "put at extreme risk".
The firm admitted to health and safety breaches at a previous hearing.
The court heard there was an "uncontrolled release" of 603kgs of potentially explosive gas from one of its five platforms on 30 November.
Gas is collected from the platforms and compressed into a liquid form. It is pumped onshore to ConocoPhillips' Theddlethorpe Gas Terminal.
During maintenance, a key valve was left open allowing the gas to vent into a turbine hall.
Dropping a metal tool could have caused a spark, resulting in a potentially deadly explosion, the court heard.
Judge Pini said: "That such failures could occur in what needs to be an industry managed with scrupulous care for the safety of individuals is a matter of grave concern.
"The failures here were not isolated but systemic and they posed extreme risk of serious harm or death."
In a statement, the company said it "deeply regrets the unplanned gas release".
"Safety is our top priority and one of our core company values.
"Following the incident we worked closely with the Health & Safety Executive (HSE) to review the incident."
The company added it carried out a "thorough review" of its operations and had taken steps to "ensure a similar event does not happen in the future".
ConocoPhillips is one of the world's largest independent oil and gas exploration companies with operations across the globe.
In addition to the fine, it was ordered to pay nearly £160,000 in costs.
