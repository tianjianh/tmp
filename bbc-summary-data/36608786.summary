Reddan could win his 71st and final Ireland cap on Saturday as he bows out in the third Test against South Africa.
He has won the Heineken Cup three times - first with Wasps and then two triumphs with current side Leinster.
"I feel that now is the right time to commit to the next chapter of my life and take on a new challenge," said Reddan on Thursday.
Reddan, who has also played for Munster and Connacht, made his international debut in 2006 against France in Paris.
In 2005 he joined Wasps and made 125 appearances before signing for Leinster at the start of the 2009-10 season.
He played for Ireland in three World Cups and featured in the 2014 and 2015 Six Nations title-winning campaigns.
"I have been privileged to be part of so many successful teams over the course of my career," added Reddan.
"To win European and domestic honours with both Wasps and Leinster has been fantastic and to taste Six Nations success with Ireland over the past three seasons has been incredible.
"I am grateful for the opportunities and experiences that professional rugby has provided over the course of my career."
Reddan has been named on the replacements bench for the decisive Test against the Springboks in Port Elizabeth.
