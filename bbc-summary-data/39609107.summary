Kevin Nugent: Barnet part company with head coach

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
League Two club Barnet have parted company with head coach Kevin Nugent after only two months in charge.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Bees won only one of 11 league games under the 48-year-old, who was appointed on 15 February, with four draws and six defeats.
Barnet are 16th in the table and nine points above the relegation zone with four matches remaining following Friday's 2-1 defeat at Exeter.
Rossi Eames will take charge for Monday's home game against Wycombe.
Eames, who spent almost three months in interim control of the first team after Martin Allen's departure to Eastleigh in December, was promoted from his position of development team coach to become Nugent's assistant in February.
In a statement, Barnet said the search for a new head coach was "under way".
