Sarah Goldie, 18, was reported missing from her home in Renfrew on Friday night having left earlier for Glasgow.
That night two men entered the Clyde after a woman was seen in the water. She was not traced despite the efforts of the men and emergency services.
Police later said Ms Goldie's bag was found near the River Clyde incident.
Ch Insp Mark Sutherland said: "Sarah left home about 1100 on Friday morning. We now know that later in the evening, she took a taxi from Glasgow to Renfrew, and was dropped off in Torridon Drive area.
"About an hour and forty minutes later, at 1940 hours, police received a call about a young woman in the River Clyde and that's also when Sarah's bag was found.
"Officers have been checking CCTV but an image of the woman who entered the water has not been captured, so at this time, we cannot confirm that it was Sarah."
Ch Insp Sutherland said officers had spoken to a number of people who came to the woman's aid but they still wanted to speak to others who may have information.
"We are keen to speak to the driver of a white 4x4 vehicle, possibly a Range Rover 'Evoque', who stopped at the time and also to the woman who handed in Sarah's bag," he said.
"As we say, at this time we cannot link the two definitively, however, we are keen to find out about Sarah's movements between the 1800 hours and 1940 hours on Friday evening.
"If you were in the area and saw the young woman near to or enter the River Clyde, or if you have any information as to Sarah's whereabouts, then please contact police."
Ms Goldie is described as white, 5ft 6in tall, of medium build, with brown eyes and sandy/strawberry blond straight hair.
She was last seen wearing a khaki green Parka-type jacket with a fur hood and was carrying a cherry-red handbag.
