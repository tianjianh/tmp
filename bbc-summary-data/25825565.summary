[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A jury has been shown CCTV footage of triple killer Joanna Dennehy laughing and joking in a shop moments before going in search of more victims.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Dennehy, 31, admits stabbing three men and dumping their bodies in ditches in Cambridgeshire.
Cambridge Crown Court heard she was driven by a thirst "for blood" as she sought further victims.
The footage was shown at the trial of Gary Stretch and Leslie Layton, accused of helping her cover up the killings.
Dennehy, of Orton Goldhay, Peterborough, has admitted murdering Lukasz Slaboszewski, 31, John Chapman, 56, and Kevin Lee, 48, who were found dumped in ditches in March and April last year.
She also admits preventing their lawful and decent burial.
Mr Stretch, real name Gary Richards, 47, of Riseholme, Orton Goldhay, Peterborough, denies preventing the lawful burial of all three men and two counts of attempted murder in relation to attacks in Hereford.
Mr Layton, 36, of Bifield, Orton Goldhay, denies perverting the course of justice and preventing the lawful burial of the bodies of Mr Chapman and Mr Lee.
In the CCTV footage, Dennehy can be seen entering Green Lane Stores in Hereford with a man called Mark Lloyd.
The court heard he was driving around the city with Dennehy and Mr Stretch last year when she stabbed two dog-walkers, Robin Bereza and John Rogers.
Dennehy has admitted their attempted murders.
Minutes before the attacks, Dennehy and Mr Lloyd stopped at the shop and bought tobacco.
Mr Lloyd told the jury that the "till was open, she was armed... I thought she was going to jump the counter and rob the till".
The footage showed Dennehy leaving the shop while Mr Lloyd waited behind, at which point, he told the court,  he considered telling the assistant to call police, but there was no time.
During cross-examination by Mr Stretch's counsel, Karim Khalil QC, Mr Lloyd said he had been scared of Dennehy and had no choice but to join the pair on the journey from King's Lynn, Norfolk, to Hereford.
He added: "If she had told me to put my head through the windscreen, I would have done."
Jurors have been told Dennehy likened herself and Mr Stretch to American outlaws Bonnie and Clyde and have seen pictures of her smiling and posing with a knife shortly after murdering Mr Slaboszewski, Mr Chapman and Mr Lee.
Another picture showed her flashing her bra and showing off self-harming scars. Mr Stretch was photographed mimicking her pose and making an obscene gesture to the camera.
Describing the moment he found out the pair were wanted by police, Mr Lloyd said he "thought it was Gary who done the murders because he's 7ft 2in and looks like Herman off The Munsters".
"She looks like butter wouldn't melt until she opens her bloody mouth."
Mr Lloyd told the court that as they made their way to Hereford, Dennehy had said: "I want to have my fun."
She had made it clear she wanted "a man with a dog" and Mr Stretch had helped with this search, he added.
Describing the attack on the first man, Mr Bereza, he said that he "thought she was going to mug him but then it twigged on me".
"I thought, 'you just want blood'."
After the second attack, on dog-walker Mr Rogers, Dennehy climbed back into the Vauxhall Astra driven by Mr Stretch.
She was carrying Mr Rogers' whippet and told the pair: "It's me only friend."
Mr Lloyd said that "afterwards, Gary drove off very, very calmly".
"It was as if they'd just stopped for McDonald's."
The trial continues.
