Guyana country profile

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Sandwiched between Venezuela and Suriname, the former British colony of Guyana is the only English-speaking country in South America.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Since independence from the UK in 1966, Guyana has seen tense relations between its citizens of African and Indians. Fierce political rivalry between the two main ethnically-based parties has led to recurring instability. Corruption too remains a chronic problem.
Most of the country is covered in tropical rainforest and despite having rich reserves of bauxite, gold and timber, it has struggled to overcome poverty and attract investment to bolster its small economy. A century-old border dispute with Venezuela has recently been revived after the discovery of offshore oil reserves.

President: David Granger
Retired army general David Granger beat incumbent President Donald Ramotar by a narrow margin in the May 2015 election, ending 23 years of rule by the Indian-dominated People's Progressive Party.
He forged a multi-ethnic coalition of his Afro-Guyanese Partnership for National Unity and the Alliance for Change, with a pledge to end the racial divisions that have dominated Guyana's politics since it gained independence in 1966.
"The time has come to end winner-take-all politics, corruption, nepotism and the squandering of our resources," he said.
Mr Granger's diverse career has included the military, journalism and politics. He has a degree in history and received military training in Nigeria, Brazil and the UK.
Guyanese newspapers are free to criticise the government, although journalists are apt to exercise self-censorship.
There were 295,200 internet users by November 2015 (via Internetworldstats).
