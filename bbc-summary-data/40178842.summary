A row of listed cottages, which are some of the oldest buildings in Belfast, are to be saved from ruin.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Six of the Rosetta Cottages in south Belfast have fallen into disrepair.
They were built in the early 1800s and housed saddlers who plied their trade to passing travellers.
Now a housing association is to restore them, turning them into two homes, but retaining their faÃ§ade and unique features.
The Hearth Heritage division of Clanmill Housing Group is in charge of the project at the junction of the Ravenhill and Ormeau Roads.
Siobhan Brown said Northern Ireland did not have too many heritage buildings and it was important to hold on to them.
"These are iconic buildings for this area and they add to its character so it's vital that they're kept," she said.
The plan is to maintain as much of the original fabric of the building as possible and reinstating original features including doors and windows.
The conservation project will cost several hundred thousand pounds.
The new homes will be finished by spring 2018.
