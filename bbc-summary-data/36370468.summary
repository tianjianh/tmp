Tony Stewart: Rotherham United attracting 'high calibre' of managerial options

Rotherham United has attracted a "high calibre" of managerial candidates to replace Neil Warnock, says chairman Tony Stewart.

Warnock left on 18 May after securing Rotherham's Championship status during his three months in charge.
Ex-Blackburn manager Gary Bowyer and former England boss Steve McClaren have been linked to the vacant position.
"My view and the board's view is that we're going to take our time," Stewart told BBC Radio Sheffield.
"That is the calibre that you've mentioned of managers that have been putting their hat in the ring.
"It would be wrong for me to start naming certain candidates because most of them are in jobs already, but it's quite complimentary that we have managers wanting to come along and be part of the team."
Steve Evans left Rotherham in September 2015 and was replaced by Neil Redfearn, who became the shortest-serving boss in Rotherham's history when he was sacked after four months.
Warnock led the Millers to Championship safety as they finished 21st in the table, nine points clear of the relegation zone.
"We'll make sure we get someone who has the knowledge, bite and enthusiasm we have seen lately with Steve Evans and Neil Warnock," Stewart added.
"The drive, push and passion is what Rotherham is about. It's in the DNA and we want to go forward with that in mind."
