The Netherlands international has signed a five-year deal and is Jose Mourinho's second signing on his return to Chelsea after German Andre Schurrle.
Marco van Ginkel joined Vitesse Arnhem when he was seven years old and has progressed through their academy. He made his debut for the club in April 2010 and his international debut came in November last year.
"I'm very happy to be at such a nice club with great players. The stadium is good and the training ground is fantastic," he told the club website.
Reports have suggested the 20-year-old was valued at about Â£8m.
Van Ginkel joined Vitesse's academy as a seven-year-old in 1999 and came through the ranks before making his first-team debut in April 2010.
He was a regular last season and emerged as one of the team's star performers as they secured fourth place in the Dutch top flight.
The midfielder made his international debut against Germany last November and was included in the Netherlands Under-21 squad for the recent European Championship in Israel.
