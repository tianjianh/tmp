Jeremy Corbyn gives top jobs to John McDonnell and Andy Burnham

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Jeremy Corbyn has named John McDonnell shadow chancellor and defeated leadership candidate Andy Burnham shadow home secretary.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Hilary Benn will be shadow foreign secretary in the new Labour leader's first shadow cabinet.
Lord Falconer will be shadow justice secretary, Angela Eagle will be shadow business secretary and Lewisham MP Heidi Alexander will oversee health.
Chuka Umunna said he was leaving the front bench by "mutual agreement".
Mary Creagh, shadow international development secretary, said she was also returning to the backbenches.
Ms Eagle was also announced as shadow first secretary of state and will deputise for Mr Corbyn at Prime Minister's Questions when David Cameron is away.
Seema Malhotra has been named shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, while Diane Abbott - a high-profile supporter of Mr Corbyn - is shadow minister for international development.
It was confirmed earlier that Rosie Winterton will continue as chief whip and Ian Murray will continue as shadow Scottish secretary.
BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said Mr Corbyn has achieved part of his first goal as leader - to include people from the centre of the party, including well-known names.
But our correspondent added many MPs will find the appointment of Mr McDonnell - a key ally of Mr Corbyn on the left - "very hard to stomach".
In other developments:
Labour's deputy leader Tom Watson had urged MPs to back Mr Corbyn.
But the other leadership candidates Yvette Cooper and Liz Kendall, as well as Ms Creagh, Tristram Hunt, Rachel Reeves, Chris Leslie, Jamie Reed, Emma Reynolds and Shabana Mahmood said they would not serve in Mr Corbyn's shadow cabinet.
Ms Cooper will, however, chair a new party taskforce on refugees.
Mr Umunna - who pulled out of the leadership race days after declaring his candidacy earlier this year - described leaving the shadow cabinet as one of the most difficult "personal political decisions" he has had to make.
"Whilst there is much on which Jeremy and I agree, there are a number of key points of difference on policy which I believe it would be dishonest to deny exist," he said.
He added he would "find it difficult to abide by the collective responsibility" of being in the shadow cabinet - "not least on the European referendum".
Mr Corbyn has said he is not content with the EU as it stands, but wants to stay to fight for a "better Europe". He had previously refused to rule out campaigning to leave.
Few MPs backed Mr Corbyn in the leadership contest - which he won with 59% of the vote - but his deputy Mr Watson told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show there was "zero chance of a coup".
He did however concede that he had differences with Mr Corbyn over the leader's desire to scrap the Trident nuclear deterrent and take the UK out of Nato.
But he said his message for those refusing to serve in the shadow cabinet was "there's always someone else that can do a front bench job".
