An FA Cup game will take place on the Channel Islands for the first time after Guernsey FC were drawn at home in next month's preliminary round.

Guernsey, who play in the eight tier of English football, will face Thamesmead Town on 20 August at Footes Lane.
"To bring the iconic competition to Guernsey will be something special," said boss Tony Vance.
When they were last drawn at home in 2013, the tie was moved as the ground was being used by a local rugby club.
What was a second qualifying-round match against Dover Athletic in the 2013-14 competition was moved away from Footes Lane to the headquarters of the Sussex County Football Association after an agreement over a rearranged kick-off time could not be reached.
The upcoming FA Cup campaign will be the fourth which Guernsey have taken part in, having first been introduced in 2013.
"The FA Cup has never gone out of the UK and here's an opportunity when it's going to, so hopefully everyone embraces it," Vance told BBC Radio Guernsey.
"Hopefully being a home draw we can be at full strength and have a good game.
"It's taken five years to get this opportunity, so it's really pleasing and I hope it goes ahead and there are no issues that happen like last time with Dover."
Thamesmead, who played Guernsey's fierce rivals Jersey in a pre-season friendly last year, play in the Isthmian League Division One North - the same step as Guernsey in the football pyramid.
Under Football Association rules if a replay is needed after Guernsey have been drawn away, it has to take place at a neutral venue on the English mainland.
