The Dons led through Adam Rooney after keeper Jack Hamilton parried Peter Pawlett's effort into his path.
Esmael Goncalves levelled after the break before Anthony O'Connor replied and Hearts' Jamie Walker was sent off.
The Dons are nine points and 23 goals better off than third-placed Rangers with three games to play, meaning they are virtually uncatchable.
Fifth-placed Hearts, meanwhile, remain six points behind St Johnstone in the battle for a top-four finish and European football.
Undefeated in their three previous meeting with Hearts this season, Aberdeen started with plenty of confidence and Andrew Considine should have done better than nod wide from eight yards after three minutes following excellent set-up work from Jonny Hayes.
Dons winger Niall McGinn was causing the home defence problems with his pace and after bursting clear of Krystian Nowak he tried his luck on goal. However, Hamilton reacted quickly to palm the ball away for a corner.
The Hearts keeper could not repeat that feat after 21 minutes and it cost his side a goal.
Pawlett won possession in midfield, drove forward and unleashed a fine drive that Hamilton parried straight into the path of Rooney, who produced a cool finish.
Walker was having one of his quieter afternoons for Hearts but when he tumbled to the ground in the box after a challenge by Ash Taylor there were claims for a penalty. Referee Willie Collum was unmoved.
Pawlett went off at the break with O'Connor coming on, while Hearts boss Ian Cathro sent on Liam Smith for Andraz Struna.
Youngster Smith provided the delivery for Hearts' equaliser just after the hour, with Goncalves sneaking in between defenders Taylor and Shay Logan to head the ball beyond Joe Lewis.
The home fans' joy lasted all of three minutes.
Hayes floated a free-kick high into the area and O'Connor rose brilliantly to nod the ball back across Hamilton and into the net.
McGinn had a chance for a third when slack play by the home defence allowed the winger a clean sight of goal, but he was unable to keep his effort down.
Bjorn Johnsen was introduced for Hearts with Don Cowie making way, a decision that brought a huge round of boos from the Tynecastle faithful.
Rooney then fired another chance wide before referee Collum sent Walker off for a second yellow card.
Aberdeen are now almost certain to finish second in the table for the third year in a row and it is no more than Derek McInnes and his charges deserve.
At times lethal in attack and so often solid at the back, the Dons look to have passed the test that came with Rangers' promotion to the Premiership in the summer with a bit to spare.
With the Scottish Cup final ahead against Celtic, the challenge facing the Pittodrie men is to ensure they do not finish the season as runners-up in all three domestic competitions.
