Edinburgh sign Nick Beavon, self-employed joiner, from Melrose

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Edinburgh have signed 29-year-old Melrose prop Nick Beavon on a one-year contract for next season.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The self-employed joiner has been on trial with the Murrayfield Pro12 side since January.
"It's massive to be signed at this stage in my career," said the tight-head, who had spells playing in Australia and New Zealand.
"I never thought it was going to happen, I thought opportunities like this would have passed me by."
Edinburgh-born Beavon has been playing for Melrose since he was 17 and carried on working during his trial period at Murrayfield.
"I was coming up to train two days a week and working the other three, to keep the money coming in," he explained. "The people I've been sub-contracting have been really good; they obviously accept I've been given this opportunity and wish me all the best.
"I got into the club international side two years ago for the first time. I still never thought anything would come of it as I was obviously older.
"However, after speaking to [Edinburgh head coach] Alan [Solomons], he reckons I've got a fair few years playing in me, that I'm reaching my prime as a tight-head.
"I don't want this opportunity to pass me by so I'm going to give it everything I've got."
