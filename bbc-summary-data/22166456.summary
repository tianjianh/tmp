Lots on sale at Imperial War Museum Duxford on Wednesday include a 1955 Mercedes Benz 300SL "Gullwing", expected to fetch up to £600,000.
A one-off 1990 Jaguar XJ220 developmental prototype is expected to sell for up to £180,000.
However, a spokesman for auctioneer H&H Classics said many smaller lots could go for as little as £20.
These include enamel signs and old petrol and oil cans.
Also on sale are old bicycles, including a Velocipede "boneshaker" and a Penny Farthing, both of which are expected to fetch more than £1,000.
They form part of the Bamber Automobilia Collection amassed since the 1970s.
More than 90 cars are on offer including the oldest, a 1915 Sunbeam 20hp Tourer estimated to be worth between £50,000 and £60,000.
The auctioneers are also selling 60 motorcycles including a 1932 Brough Superior BS4, one of only 10 of its type built by the factory in 1932.
