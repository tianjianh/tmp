Miller turned the ball home from close range after Ross Lafayette's cross from the left fell to him eight minutes from time, having earlier been denied by a low save from Will Norris.
Dover almost took an early lead through Lafayette, who ran on to Mitch Walker's long clearance and fired a shot which was deflected just wide.
Cambridge grew into the game and saw Uche Ikpeazu thump the crossbar with an effort following Piero Mingoia's cross, before Max Clark fired just over from 25 yards.
Their pressure paid off seven minutes before the interval when Luke Berry's shot was spilled by Walker and the ball fell to Mingoia, who turned home from close range.
Ikpeazu should have sealed the game after 72 minutes but blazed over after being played in by Mingoia following a quick breakaway and the Us were made to rue the miss when Miller struck late on.
