Steven Tolley, 48, from Tiverton was one of three men injured while working on the northbound carriageway of the A361 at Gornhay Cross, Tiverton.
He was airlifted to Derriford Hospital after the collision on 29 January but died on Monday.
The driver, 43, from Saltash, was arrested on suspicion of dangerous driving and bailed until 20 May.
Another worker in his 40s was airlifted to hospital for treatment for "serious injuries" and a third was described as "walking wounded". Both are now recovering at home.
All three were employed by the South West Highways team which said it had informed its staff of the "sad loss" and was in touch with Mr Tolley's family.
It added that there would be an internal investigation into the incident "as a matter of course".
The police and the Health and Safety Executive are also investigating the incident.
Anyone with information is urged to contact the police.
