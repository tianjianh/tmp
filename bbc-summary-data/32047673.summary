Eve Stratford, 22, who worked at London's Playboy club, was found with her throat slashed in her home in Leyton, east London, in March 1975.
Six months later, Lynne Weedon, 16, was attacked and raped in an alleyway near her home in Hounslow, west London.
The murders were linked in 2004 after matching DNA was found on the victims.
The victims were not thought to have known each other.
Lynne's mother, Margaret Weedon, said: "1975 seems so long ago and it is, 40 years without her.
"We have missed out on so much; she missed out on life, no relationship or marriage, no career or children or even just travelling the world, all taken from her.
"We are left always wondering what it would have been like - a true life sentence."
She added: "We are well aware that whoever murdered Lynne also murdered Eve Stratford.
"That young lady also had her life snubbed out. Her family have died now. Another true life sentence."
Ms Stratford was found dead with her hands tied by a scarf in the bedroom of her flat, in Lyndhurst Drive, after her neck had been cut almost a dozen times.
Investigating officer, Det Ch Insp Noel McHugh, said the suspect for both murders was likely to be in his 60s or 70s.
He added: "It's inconceivable the killer of Eve and Lynne has kept the perfect secret for 40 years.
"It's a heavy burden to carry and he must have let details slip over the years - maybe to a partner, a friend, even a cellmate - and I would appeal to anyone with information to contact us."
