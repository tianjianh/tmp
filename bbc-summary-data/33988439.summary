Schoolchildren in the Borders could win a "golden ticket" to travel on the new Borders Railway.

In a nod to Roald Dahl's Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, youngsters will find their winning ticket in commemorative chocolate bars.
They will be distributed to all 72 primary and secondary schools in the region to mark the railway's opening.
One child from every school will win a return trip between Stow and Edinburgh on 5 September.
The Borders Railway will officially begin operating between Tweedbank and Edinburgh the following day.
Councillor Sandy Aitchison said: "All pupils will enjoy a week-long series of events and lessons around the themes of literacy and journeys.
"This will include some additional prizes of book tokens as well as lots of interesting Borders Railway themed activities.
"Those lucky enough to find one of the rare Golden Tickets will join fellow pupils from schools across the Borders to take part in the historic opening of the new railway line."
