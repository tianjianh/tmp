[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Ethem Orhon, 67, inflicted "appalling injuries" on his victims during the rampage outside Sainsbury's in Hampton, west London on 20 May, a court heard.
The attacks happened a day after Orhon was arrested for possessing a knife.
He was found guilty of two counts of attempted murder and two counts of wounding with intent to cause GBH.
A Kingston Crown Court jury took four hours and 55 minutes to find Orhon, of Deacons Walk, guilty of the offences.
'I thought I was going to die'
Orhon told the court he was "like a zombie" and felt "hypnotised" as he attacked strangers with a Leatherman knife, hours after being bailed by police.
He said he had felt humiliated after being strip-searched by officers when he was arrested.
Sentencing, Judge Paul Dodgson told Orhon: "This was a planned attempt to kill albeit while the balance of your mind was disturbed.
"You took that knife intending to use it, intending to kill people."
"You are on your own and as a loner it may be you are someone who tends to brood on matters," the judge added commenting on his "unusual personality".
Suzanna Brand, Janet Morsy, Jean Sullivan, and Charandasi Chandiramani, were randomly targeted, the jury heard.
Ms Brand, 53 was hit from behind, struck 13 times and left with two collapsed lungs.
Ms Morsy, 63, thought she was going to die as she was struck in the arm and chest and tried to defend herself.
Ms Sullivan, 68, was stabbed in the back, damaging her chest wall, right lung and liver.
Ms Chandiramani, 71, was stabbed twice in the back.
Speaking outside court after the verdict, Janet Morsy, who has spoken to the BBC about her ordeal, said the experience has "completely changed" her life.
"When I see someone with hands in their pockets I fully expect them to pull a blade," she said.
Chandarasi Chandiramani, who has suffered with post-traumatic stress disorder since she was injured by Orhon, said she still sees "the madness in his eyes at night" but the verdict has provided closure.
"The mental aspect has a profound effect on my life," she said.
"Hopefully now I can get off the sleeping tablets - I don't want to be addicted to anything - and get back to my old life."
The court heard Orhon was distracted by two schoolboys from the nearby Hampton Grammar, who warned other passers-by and called 999.
Praising the boys the judge said they "certainly averted a greater disaster" and awarded them Â£1,000 each to recognise their "bravery" and thanking them on behalf of the whole community.
Jurors were told the Orhon, who is from Turkey, had left Belgravia police station after being charged with having a bladed article in a public place.
He later told police he went home picked up a knife before heading for the crowded supermarket, less than 10 minutes from his home.
