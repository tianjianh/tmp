Former Scotland and Blackburn Rovers captain Colin Hendry has pleaded guilty to harassing his ex-girlfriend.

Hendry, 49, admitted sending unwanted text messages and emails to beautician Sarah Kinder after she ended their relationship in March.
An allegation of common assault against Hendry was dropped after Ms Kinder retracted her statement.
Blackpool magistrates adjourned sentencing until 20 August for a Probation Service report.
The court heard Hendry, of Lytham St Annes, Lancashire, accepted he made unwanted visits to Ms Kinder's home in the town and twice threw stones at her bedroom window.
Ms Kinder retracted her allegation the ex-footballer grabbed her arm several times as she tried to get in a taxi.
She attended Blackpool Magistrates' Court but was not required to give evidence in a scheduled trial.
Hendry began seeing Ms Kinder after his wife Denise, 42, passed away in 2009 as a result of botched cosmetic surgery.
Ms Kinder broke off the relationship in late December 2014 but they were reunited on 21 February, the court heard.
Hendry was told sentencing options ranged from a custodial sentence to a community order.
Ms Kinder finally ended the relationship on 3 March and Hendry's catalogue of harassment followed from that date until 18 April, it was said.
He said in a basis of plea he was "extremely upset and confused" by the March break-up and accepted his behaviour which followed was "unacceptable".
Hendry would check "if she was okay" by sometimes driving past her home and entered it once through an unlocked front door.
He saw Ms Kinder in two bars in Lytham on 17 April and had been told she was "very drunk, upset and walking barefoot". He went over to help as she got into a taxi but added: "I accept she did not want my help."
Hendry received a 17-month driving ban earlier this year after admitting drink-driving in Lytham early on 21 February.
He was previously reported to have "bombarded" Ms Kinder with text messages following the first split and was given a harassment order.
The central defender captained his country in the 1998 World Cup and appeared for a series of clubs including Blackburn Rovers, Manchester City, Bolton Wanderers, Blackpool and Rangers.
He also managed Blackpool and Clyde.
