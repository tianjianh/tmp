Joe Leach: Unbeaten Worcestershire a threat to any team in the country

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Captain Joe Leach says few teams would relish facing his Worcestershire side in their current form.

Worcestershire are the only club in either division of the County Championship with a 100% record, after an innings victory over Derbyshire.
"We're playing good cricket at the moment," Leach told BBC Hereford & Worcester following their third win in as many Division Two games.
"There's not many sides in the country who would want to come up against us."
Leach took 4-50 and 5-32 in the victory at Derby, taking his tally for the season to 22 wickets. Worcestershire also topped the One-Day Cup North Group, winning six of their eight games, to earn a home semi-final.
The 26-year-old says his side will remain confident going into their next four-day match at Northamptonshire, which starts on Friday.
"At the moment, opportunities seem to be leading to wins which is obviously a great habit to be in," he said.
"It's a hungry group. We're very clear about what we want to achieve this season.
"When you play under Bumpy [director of cricket Steve Rhodes], there's not much chance of there being any complacency."
