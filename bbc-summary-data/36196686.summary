Samuel Garner, 17, was hit on Welford Road outside Leicester Prison, just after 23:00 BST on Sunday.
Leicestershire Police said he died at the scene after being seriously injured when a black BMW 5 Series hit a group of pedestrians.
A teenage girl also suffered injuries but these were described as minor.
Officers said the car failed to stop at the scene and was last seen driving towards Almond Road.
It was found on Monday burned out on College Road, Whetstone, after being stolen from Blaby, Leicestershire, on 29 April.
Mr Garner's parents, Scott and Tracie Garner, described their son as "perfect, loving and thoughtful".
"He was due to turn 18 tomorrow [Wednesday] and we were going to fly out to Prague this morning [Tuesday] to celebrate," they said.
"He was our world and will always be in our hearts.
"If you've heard any rumours about who the driver was, please come forward."
They added that their son had spent Sunday afternoon with his family watching Leicester City's 1-1 draw against Manchester United before heading into the city centre - wearing his white Foxes football shirt - with his friends.
It is believed the car had two occupants. No arrests have been made yet in connection with the teenager's death.
Anyone with any information on the crash is asked to contact Leicestershire Police.
