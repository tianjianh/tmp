New Chagford £2.6m school a 'waste of money'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Campaigners have accused government officials of wasting money if a new school is built at a cost of £2.6m.

They argue Chagford Primary on Dartmoor could be refurbished for much less than the cost of demolition and replacement.
The campaigners claim officials took the decision to rebuild before a feasibility report last June.
The Department for Education (DfE) rejected the claim and said the decision to rebuild the school was "taken after careful consideration".
A number of parents of children at the school, as well as people living nearby, want the current 1930s-built building to be refurbished rather than rebuilt.
One of the campaigners, Jane Rush, said: "Building new schools is great, but a survey last year showed the school was in good condition.
"This school isn't in poor condition so it's not needed.
"The best value for money option is refurbishing it, so I think they are wasting money."
The DfE said in a statement: "We are confident a rebuild represents the best outcome for pupils, staff, the local community and the taxpayer."
