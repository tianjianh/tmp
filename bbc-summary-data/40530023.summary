It is a tremendously exciting set of opening week fixtures on paper.
Whatever any team did last season is not going to be good enough for this one. Every team is progressing.
Every team is looking to get better, whether it is their training, analysis or the players. The Premiership does always get better.
You look at some of the new players coming into the Premiership and it is just quality added on quality. I almost laughed when I heard Wasps had signed Marcus Watson, as out wide is not an area they struggle in too much.
It is the most competitive league and for me, the best in the world. Last year, by the final round we still had nine teams with something still to play for and that is testament to how hard these guys work and how competitive it is.
