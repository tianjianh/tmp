Police said a man approached the 21-year-old before pushing her to the ground on Beaumont Street, Toxteth, and sexually assaulting her in the early hours of 19 July.
The suspect was not known to the woman, Merseyside Police said.
The arrested 25-year-old, from Birmingham, is also being held on suspicion of money laundering.
The case featured on the BBC's Crimewatch programme last month.
