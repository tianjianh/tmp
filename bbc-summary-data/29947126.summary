Northern Ireland slipped to second in the group, one point behind Romania.
Romania began the first European Championship qualifying meeting between the sides hoping to avoid a repeat of their only previous competitive home match with Northern Ireland, a World Cup qualifier in October, 1985, which they lost 1-0.
Michael O'Neill's Northern Ireland went into the game full of confidence but without several injured players, including skipper Steven Davis.
Anghel Iordanescu was beginning his third spell as Romania coach following the departure of Victor Piturca, who left to take up a lucrative deal with Saudi Arabian side Ittihad last month.
The hosts, also without several first-choice regulars, began brightly and a bicycle kick by out-of-favour Tottenham defender Vlad Chiriches was gathered by Roy Carroll.

A minute later Brunt's low left-foot shot went just wide of the left-hand post, before Chipciu shot against the underside of the bar and then headed straight at Carroll.
With Romania assuming control, Lucian Sanmartaen picked up the ball on the halfway line and waltzed through the visitors' defence, only for Stancuto to lose his footing with the goal gaping.
Kyle Lafferty had a shot palmed away by Ciprian Tatarusanu and, after the break, Carroll stood up well to deny Romania captain Razvan Rat.
Northern Ireland were finally broken down when Papp drove a left-footed shot into the top right-hand corner after Gareth McAuley failed to clear a cross, and the right-back sealed victory six minutes later when he met a left-wing cross.
Hungary beat Finland 1-0 to move third in the group, two points behind Northern Ireland.
Northern Ireland's next game is against Finland at Windsor Park on 29 March, when Romania entertain the Faroe Islands.
