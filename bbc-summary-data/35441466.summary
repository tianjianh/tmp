Tech Tent: Toys with a tech twist and Apple's difficult week

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Every Friday on Tech Tent on the BBC World Service we bring you the big technology stories of the week. Here's what's in today's very playful show.

This week we visited the London Toy Fair which has become a great place to spot how tech trends are reflected in the world of play. We found that traditional toymakers are finding ways of grabbing children's attention back from the touch screen devices they all now have. So the best toys combine the physical with the digital - in the latest version of the Scalextric car-racing game a tablet controls the race and tells drivers when to come into the pits. Then there is a toy called Stikbot which, combined with a free app, encourages children to make stop motion animations.
Still with toys, or rather games, this week saw a computer program beat a champion player at Go. The 2,500-year-old game has simple rules but presents a fiendishly complex challenge for the AI researchers who have been racing to create a program to play it at a professional level. Just hours after Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg wrote about his firm's efforts to tackle the problem, Google's DeepMind trumped that with the news that its AlphaGo program had beaten the European Go champion five games in a row. We have an interview with DeepMind's founder Demis Hassabis.
The streaming video service Netflix is expanding worldwide, so can any local content provider compete? Jason Njoku, founder of Nigeria's iROKOtv, certainly thinks he has a chance with a service which offers Nollywood movies and TV programmes. He tells us why expat Nigerians and a domestic audience is eager to get access via their mobile phones to high quality content. Like Netflix, iROKO is now investing in creating as well as distributing content and Mr Njoku has just persuaded investors including Canal Plus to back this venture.
Apple delivered another quarter of record profits, but the revelation that iPhone sales look certain to suffer their first decline over the next three months, sent its shares tumbling. The mobile phone industry guru Ian Fogg of IHS Consulting tells us that even if the market is disappointed, Apple is still making huge profits from every phone. He says the firm now faces an interesting choice - keep prices sky-high to boost profits further, or nudge sales higher with more affordable phones.
