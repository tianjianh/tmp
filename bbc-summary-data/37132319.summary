Glass Butter Beach runs from Friday to Sunday at Abersoch, Gwynedd.
Organisers said due to "adverse weather conditions", there would be a delay in the opening of the main arena and the music programme would be altered.
The festival was due to open from 12:00 BST on Friday, Saturday and Sunday. On Friday, the main arena opened at 13:00 with changes to main stage timings.
A yellow "be aware" warning for strong winds and large waves has been issued by the Met Office for Welsh coastal areas for Saturday.
Flood alerts for Pembrokeshire, Ceredigion, Carmarthenshire and Swansea are also in place, with high tides predicted to last from Friday to Monday.
