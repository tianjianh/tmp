Kwabs, Kate Tempest and Shura are also on the line-up for the festival from the people behind Ibiza Rocks.
There will also be DJ sets from Rudimental, Zane Lowe and B. Traits on the party beach of Zrce, on the island of Pag.
It comes as Ibiza Rocks celebrates a decade on the White Isle. Mallorca Rocks ended in September.
New acts including Brighton-based surf-rockers Black Honey and The Bulletproof Bomb will hit the Adriatic Coast.
While festival goers can also expect DJ sets from Fatboy Slim, Wilkinson, Waze & Odyssey and Jaymo & Andy George.
Croatia Rocks is working with the organisers of Hideout Festival, who have run their event in Zrce for the past four years.
Shane Murray, brand director of Ibiza Rocks said: "This is a genuinely exciting move for Ibiza Rocks and marks a significant new chapter in our story as we reach 10.
"Croatia has clearly evolved from an emerging to an established music destination and it's long been a wish of ours to bring the spirit of Ibiza Rocks to the beach."
Tickets for Croatia Rocks are now on sale, with more of the line-up being announced nearer the event.
