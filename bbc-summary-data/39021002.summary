Thompson, 43, has worked alongside Clark at Birmingham and Blackpool.
"He has a great knowledge of the game and, coupled with the staff who are already here, I am looking forward to working with them all," said Clark.
Saturday's 2-1 win at Chesterfield was Clark's first game in charge after he left Scottish club Kilmarnock to join League One Bury on Wednesday.
