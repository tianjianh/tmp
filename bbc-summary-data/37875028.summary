Craig White: Hampshire appoint former England all-rounder as head coach

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Former England all-rounder Craig White has been named head coach of Hampshire.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 46-year-old has signed a two-year contract and steps up to the post vacated by Dale Benkenstein midway through last season at the Ageas Bowl.
White made his name at Yorkshire, before going on to play 30 Tests and 51 one-day internationals for England.
"I'm flattered and honoured," White told BBC Radio Solent. "It's a fantastic opportunity for me and I can't wait to get started in the job."
White, previously the county's assistant and bowling coach, took charge for six County Championship matches last season following Benkenstein's departure.
But he was unable to prevent Hampshire finishing in the bottom two of Division One.
However, Durham's subsequent relegation and punishment by the England and Wales Cricket Board because of financial issues meant Hampshire were reinstated in the top division for next season.
"I was thrust into the job and I really enjoyed it," added White, who played in 30 Tests and 51 one-day internationals for England between 1994 and 2003.
"It was something I didn't think I was quite ready for. Maybe another two or three years learning the trade might have been the right time.
"But when [director of cricket] Giles White mentioned would I take on the job full-time, I said I would.
"I think some big names applied, so to be given the job permanently is a great honour."
