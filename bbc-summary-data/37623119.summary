Neil Taylor expects Swansea City to be rejuvenated by new boss Bob Bradley.

The 58-year old, who is the first American to manage in the Premier League, succeeded Francesco Guidolin as Swansea boss with the club only outside the relegation zone on goal difference.
"He strives to get the best out of players. The lads have said training has been really good," said Taylor, who has been on Wales duty.
"He looks a really exciting manager. He looks up for it and backs his ability."
Bradley could not have asked for a tougher baptism on Saturday with Arsenal having won seven of their last eight games in all competitions.

However, left-back Taylor believes former USA national coach Bradley has already galvanised the squad.
"Hopefully from here onwards we can pick up results because that is what matters in the Premier League," he said.
"He looks very motivated and that is great for the players. We can feed off him and we need to use that to pick up results, that is obvious now."
Taylor fell out of favour under former manager Guidolin, starting only one Premier League game this term in which he was substituted before half-time, but he does not see Bradley's appointment as a new beginning for him.
"I will just go back and work the same way I was working under the old manager, that is the way I do things," Taylor said.
"It makes no difference to me, but obviously there will be different ideas.
"There are ups and downs for every footballer, you just stay on a level playing field whether you are up or down. You keep working the same way, things come back around - that is the way football is."

Swansea are not expected to end their losing run at the Emirates Stadium with in-form Arsenal winning their last five league matches to move up to third place.
But Swansea have an excellent away record against Arsenal having won on three of their five Premier League visits, including a 2-1 win last season.
"It is a tough first game but we don't mind playing that," Taylor said.
"We are hoping we can pick up from where we left off there last season and pick up points. We would be probably written off even if we were in form."
