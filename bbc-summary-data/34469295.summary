Pursued by security guards, a suspect ran from the Home Depot hardware store to a sport-utility vehicle driven by an accomplice outside.
The woman fired several shots with a 9mm handgun at the vehicle as it drove away, the Detroit Free Press reported.
The suspects escaped on Tuesday with $1,000 (Â£652) worth of merchandise.
Police said the 48-year-old woman had a licence to carry a concealed weapon and has co-operated with the officers. She was released pending an investigation.
No injuries were reported outside the store in Auburn Hills, Michigan, about 35 miles (56km) north of Detroit.
However, police said a bullet may have hit the rear tyre of the get-away vehicle.
The woman could face possible criminal charges for firing her weapon without being directly threatened.
