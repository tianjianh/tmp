[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A 90th-minute Alex Schalk goal delivered Ross County's first piece of major silverware as they beat Hibernian to lift the Scottish League Cup.

Hibs controlled much of the opening half, but fell behind to Michael Gardyne's goal after he broke free of Mark Oxley and Liam Fontaine.
Fontaine redeemed himself, scoring Hibs' equaliser just before half-time.
However, it was the defender's poor clearance that allowed Schalk to score the winning goal at the death.
Jim McIntyre opted to line his side up in a 3-5-2 shape that they had not used before this season, but which the coaching staff had seen other sides use well against Hibs this season.
The play was frantic and urgent from the outset. Players were performing by their wits rather than any pre-planned strategy, and Jason Cummings' resourcefulness was almost telling when he lifted a 30-yard shot goalwards that Gary Woods had to move smartly to tip over the bar.
A counter-attack by County saw Schalk try to play Gardyne through. The pass was misplaced, but Jackson Irvine regathered possession and he did find Gardyne. Fontaine's tackle only moved the ball away from Oxley, allowing Gardyne to prod the ball into the empty net.
The goal was against the run of play, but Hibs did not allow it to unnerve them. Darren McGregor might have equalised, but headed over from a good position at the back post. Cummings also saw a hooked shot saved by Gary Woods in the County goal.
A set-piece ought to have been a chance for County to rely on their organisation at the back, but there was a lack of command as a corner was fired into the penalty area and Fontaine rifled the ball into the corner of the net.
The County players left the field at the interval looking dejected. Hibs would have felt that the momentum was in their favour, and Cummings and Anthony Stokes both had early chances to fire their side in front.
The introduction of Brian Graham for the ineffective Liam Boyce provided County with a greater presence up front and somebody to build attacks around. The forward thought he had scored when he out-jumped Oxley to nod the ball in from close-range, but he was harshly judged to have fouled the goalkeeper.
Yet in the final moments of the game, with Schalk and Gardyne having suffered from injuries, County found the means to win the final. The latter's break down the left saw Fontaine send his clearance straight to Schalk, who finished from close range to secure the first major trophy in County's history.
