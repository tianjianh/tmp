The 27-year-old is currently without a club after leaving Championship side Reading at the end of the season.
But he has grabbed the headlines with a stunning goal in the 3-1 quarter-final win over Belgium last Friday.
"I had offers before the tournament - good offers from good, progressive clubs - but I made a decision to wait," Robson-Kanu told BBC Sport.

"I made a decision to run my contract at Reading down. I've been there 12 years, given a lot of service and felt it was the best decision for myself and my career. It's probably one of the best decisions of my life.
"I've made no secret of my desire to play in the Premier League and if that's the best place for me then I'll be there," he said.
Robson-Kanu's goal against Belgium was only his fourth in 34 appearances for Wales. He only scored five goals in 35 appearances for Reading last season.
But his industrious displays in France have made him an important figure.
He was an injury doubt before the tournament so he started the campaign on the bench, but he came on as a substitute to score the winning goal in the opening group game against Slovakia.
He then started in the defeat by England, lost his place to Sam Vokes for the wins over Russia and Northern Ireland before returning to the starting line-up in spectacular fashion against Belgium.
"That's the crazy nature of football, it shows how quickly things can turn," said Wales manager Chris Coleman.
"He could have missed the tournament, been without a contract for next season. That's not a good position for a player to be in."
Coleman added: "I'd imagine there's a lot of interest - and he deserves it - but he knows there's work to be done here."
Wales face Portugal in Wednesday's semi-final.
It is being billed as the country's biggest-ever football match and pits Gareth Bale against Real Madrid club-mate Cristiano Ronaldo.
