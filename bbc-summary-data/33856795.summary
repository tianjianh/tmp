Kezia Dugdale: Schools must be better than just satisfactory

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Scottish Labour leadership hopeful Kezia Dugdale has said educational attainment must rise beyond "just satisfactory".

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Nine out of 10 schools are rated at least "satisfactory" by inspectors.
Lothians MSP Ms Dugdale said that amounted to "settling for second best" while performance had not risen under the SNP since 2008.
The Scottish government said it was a top priority to ensure Scottish education was "truly world class".
In a speech in Edinburgh later, Ms Dugdale will say "satisfactory means that areas of strength only just outweigh areas of weakness".
Speaking ahead of the speech, she said: "We know that 90% of Scotland's schools are meeting inspection criteria of satisfactory or better.
"This level of performance has not risen since 2008, the year after the current SNP government took office.
"Are we really saying that the extent of our ambition for Scotland's schools is for them to be simply satisfactory?
"Have we really settled for second best for our young people?
"Satisfactory just isn't good enough for Scotland's schools. Not today, certainly not tomorrow and certainly not for me."
The Scottish government said there was "a lot to be proud of" in the education system.
A spokesman said: " Students achieved a record 156,000 Higher passes this year - up 5.5% on 2014 and 92% of young people are now in work, training or education.
"Meanwhile, research from Ucas in June showed a 50% increase in higher education applications from 18-year-olds in the most deprived areas of Scotland since 2006.
"We have built or refurbished 526 schools since 2007 and we are making sure we have the right number of teachers by investing ??51m to protect teacher numbers.
"But we know there's more to do. There is still a gap between the most and the least disadvantaged pupils and we are determined to end this."
The Scottish Conservates said Ms Dugdale's extra spending plans would involve taxing high earners more to boost teacher pay.
The party's finance spokesman Murdo Fraser said: "This policy will be cheered to the rafters - by George Osborne. What does Labour think will happen if Scotland increases taxes on high earners above the rates they pay in England?
"High earners are among the most mobile in society and many will move south of the border if they are asked to pay more in Scotland than elsewhere in the UK."
