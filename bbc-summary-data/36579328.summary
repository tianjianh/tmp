The Talking Statues project brings the city's history to life when smartphone users scan a code to receive a call.
Ms Whelan, Yara Greyjoy in the TV series, is the voice of Drury Dame, an elegant lamp bearer who tells how her appearance caused an outcry. Mr Reeves is the Black Prince in City Square.
The statues can be heard for the next year as part of the Yorkshire Festival.
Elsewhere in the city, Going Viral playwright Daniel Bye and Shameless actor Lee Toomes created a voice for the statue of World War II pilot Arthur Aaron at Eastgate, while Coronation Street actor Drew Cain revealed the thoughts of inventor James Watt at City Square.
Yorkshire poet Ian McMillan asks what a Frenchman is doing playing petanque in Bond Court and actor Brian Blessed is the voice of a stone lion outside the city's town hall.
Mr McMillan said: "I'm always wanting to explore new ideas of getting language performed in places you don't expect it, and you certainly don't expect statues to start telling you a story.
"As a child I had a fantasy that statues were just dying to tell you their stories, and now I can make that dream into a reality."
Matt Burman, of the Yorkshire Festival, said: "Talking Statues is a fantastic project; mixing culture, technology, a little bit of history and a lot of fun."
