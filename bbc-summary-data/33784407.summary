A green wing macaw worth Â£2,000 has been stolen from a pet shop by a burglar who fled with the bird on the handlebars of his bike.

The female parrot, called Charlie, was stolen in the early hours of Tuesday from Timperley Aquatics Pet & Reptile Centre, in Greater Manchester.
"I'm disgusted," said shop owner Graham Ralston, who said he thought Charlie must have put up a fight.
The thief smashed the store window with a wheelie-bin.
"A member of the public saw the bird being manhandled on a bike and she wasn't best pleased as she was making a hell of a racket," said Mr Ralston.
"Charlie must have put up quite a fight, the thief had brought a bag but had to leave it in the aviary," said Mr Ralston.
He said the macaw was affectionately known as Baby, and was a shop bird and not for sale. He said he often walked round the store, in Stockport Road, Timperley, with Charlie on his shoulder.
"She is a great character, she loves me and I love her - when I go in the shop and say 'Hello Baby' she responds 'Hello Baby'," he said.
"She will sit there and dance and say 'Hello Baby' when she gets excited."
