A memorial service is being held to mark the 30th anniversary of a fatal fire which ripped through Bradford City's home ground.

The blaze broke out during the club's 1985 match against Lincoln City, killing 54 Bradford City fans, two Lincoln fans and injuring many more.
Bells will ring for each victim as their name is read out, followed by a minute's silence.
Hundreds are attending the service in the city's Centenary Square.
Football League Chief Executive Shaun Harvey, Bradford City manager Phil Parkinson, and captain Stephen Darby were also there.
After the minute's silence, the City of Bradford Brass Band will play You'll Never Walk Alone while wreaths were laid.
Fire engines parked on Centenary Square for the service, and a garland of flowers was placed on the Memorial Bell at the top of City Hall's civic staircase.
The bell belonged to the first fire engine to arrive at the scene of the blaze and was donated to the city by the fire service.
Lord Mayor Mike Gibbons said: "The Bradford City fire lives long in the memories of the people of Bradford.
"I feel it is very important that we as a city take time each year to remember those who lost their lives or were injured by this tragic event, which continues to touch the lives of so many in our district."
The 1985 fire is thought to have been started accidentally when a lit cigarette was dropped under a wooden stand.
The day started in celebration, marking Bradford City's return to the second tier of English football for the first time in decades, with players parading the old Division Three trophy around the ground before kick-off.
In April, the judge who led an inquiry into the fire said claims it may have been started deliberately were "nonsense".
