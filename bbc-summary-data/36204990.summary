Faye Allen died after suffering an adverse reaction to a form of the drug known as Mastercard.
She became ill at the Victoria Warehouse in Trafford on Monday.
A man and a woman, aged 19 and 20, who were held on suspicion of possession with intent to supply a Class A drug, were released until 1 July.
Ms Allen, from Liverpool, died in Manchester Royal Infirmary, where she was taken shortly after 05:00 BST.
She had suffered a "desperately tragic and fatal reaction" after purchasing and consuming the tablet at the venue, Greater Manchester Police said.
Police warned the "small, pink figure of eight" tablet, which has "white or red dots" and the word Mastercard printed across it, might contain "up to double the dose of MDMA expected in ecstasy tablets."
Anybody who had taken the drug was urged to seek medical assistance.
