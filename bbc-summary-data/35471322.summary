Woman admits trying to steal baby in Aberdeen

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A woman has admitted trying to steal a baby in Aberdeen.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Joan Smith, 44, admitted a charge of attempted plagium after she tried to steal the eight-month-old infant from a pram on a bus in Holburn Road in November.
Aberdeen Sheriff Court heard the child's mother reported the incident and that she had been frightened.
Sheriff Graeme Buchanan deferred sentence for background reports until later this year.
The court heard the child's mother saw Smith place both her hands on the infant's arms and tried to lift the baby out of the pram.
The pram straps prevented the child from being removed. Smith then left the bus.
The child's mother told officers that she strongly believed that the woman would have taken her baby if the child had not been strapped in.
