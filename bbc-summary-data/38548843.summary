Atalanta ensured a nervy finish when 18-year-old Emmanuel Latte Lath made it 3-2 but Juve held on.
Juventus boss Massimiliano Allegri said: "I won't accept us taking our foot off the gas.
"This seems to happen to us a lot now, at least once a month."
Juve were comfortable in a first half that saw Paulo Dybala beat Etrit Berisha with a superb first-time strike and then Mario Mandzukic sweep home a second, before Abdoulay Konko narrowed the gap.
Juventus, who have won the Italian Cup for the past two years, will play Milan or Torino in the last eight.
