Malik Obama, a Muslim with Kenyan and US citizenship, has previously said he will vote for Mr Trump on 8 November.
He told the New York Post he was "excited" about attending the debate at 09:00 EDT (01:00 GMT) in Las Vegas.
Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton is bringing two of her prominent backers.
Mr Trump, who is facing sinking poll numbers and accusations of sexual assault, said he was "very much looking forward to meeting and being with Malik" later.
"He gets it far better than his brother," he added.
Malik Obama, 58, who accused President Obama of turning his back on his family earlier this year, told the New York Post he believes Mr Trump can "make America great again".
He also backed Mr Trump over allegations from several women of sexual assault.
"I don't believe them," he said. "Why didn't they come forward before?"
The Republican nominee has also invited Patricia Smith, whose son was killed in an attack on the US diplomatic mission in Benghazi, Libya, in 2012, while Mrs Clinton was US secretary of state.
Mrs Clinton is bringing billionaire owner of the Dallas Mavericks, Mark Cuban, and Meg Whitman, Hewlett Packard Enterprise CEO, one of her highest-profile Republican backers.
Millions are expected to tune into the final debate, which will be moderated by Fox News journalist Chris Wallace.
The two candidates will discuss six topics:
On Tuesday, Mr Obama told Mr Trump to "stop whining" as he rejected the Republican nominee's claim that next month's White House election would be rigged in favour of Hillary Clinton.
He also criticised Mr Trump's  "flattery" of Russian President Vladimir Putin.
At the second presidential debate, Mr Trump appeared with three women who have accused Bill Clinton of sexual misconduct.
Mr Trump was forced to address his obscene remarks about women during the debate, after the emergence of a 2005 sex boast tape.
Mr Trump had denied any impropriety, but a number of women have come forward with sexual assault allegations against him.
