A man who was cleared of trying to kill his ex-partner in an 85mph crash has been sentenced for dangerous driving.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Pervaiz Mirz was accused of dousing Tracy Taylor in petrol and crashing into a barrier on Newcastle's central motorway, the city's crown court heard.
The 45-year-old was cleared of attempted murder but admitted causing serious injury by dangerous driving.
Mirz, a taxi driver, was sentenced to 15 months, suspended for two years.
The hearing heard Mirz, of Shrewsbury Close, Heaton, told police he had not meant to harm Miss Taylor, who he has six children with, when he crashed on December 22 last year.
He said there was petrol in the car because he was planning to set himself on fire because he was distraught over their break up.
He told the hearing that petrol spilled on Miss Taylor when a struggle took place.
The court heard the crash barrier, designed to crumple on impact, potentially saved the pair from fatal injuries.
Miss Taylor told the court that Mirz was a good partner and father and had never hurt her.
Judge John Milford said he had taken into account her plea on behalf of Mirz when giving him a suspended sentence.
