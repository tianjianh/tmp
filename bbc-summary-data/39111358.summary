The 19-year-old on-loan striker was treated at his parent club Chelsea after 14 February's loss at Leeds.
Norwich manager Alex Neil will make changes to his side after Saturday's 5-1 thumping at Sheffield Wednesday.
Ryan Bennett, Josh Murphy, Alex Pritchard and Yanic Wildschut may all push for places in the starting side.
Bristol City are in the relegation zone after one league win from 16, while eighth-placed Norwich will look to avoid adding to the 10 away defeats they have already suffered this term.
Bristol City head coach Lee Johnson told BBC Radio Bristol:
"We are desperate to get that win that makes us feel better. This is a great chance for that.
"Probably going into this game as the underdog is not a bad place for Bristol City to be because we always perform quite well in that type of scenario.
"It is in our hands. We have seen how quickly football changes and, this time next week, we hope to have two wins under our belt."
