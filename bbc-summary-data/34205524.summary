[SN]TITLE[SN]
Everything the new arrival needs to know about Australia

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Syria is a long way from Australia and the 12,000 refugees who will make their way south over the next 12 months will be likely to measure the distance in more than kilometres.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
In a surprising policy change, the Australian government this week said it would accept 12,000 Syrian refugees from camps in Jordan, Lebanon and Turkey.
In what will be Australia's biggest refugee intake in decades, the government is rushing to find accommodation and extra services to help resettle people fleeing trauma and persecution in their home country.
It won't be easy moving to a strange, new country but the government has a helpful explainer for new arrivals.
The "Life in Australia" booklet, published by the Department of Immigration and Citizenship, offers handy tips and explanations about the ways down under.
There are facts and figures about the country, an explanation of national symbols and a potted history of this "wide, brown land".
More intriguingly, the faceless bureaucrats have offered a cultural snapshot that may bemuse rather than reassure new arrivals, complete with definitions for time-honoured phrases such as "drop by this arvo for a cuppa" (please visit this afternoon for a cup of tea or coffee) and "no worries", which of course means "the task or request will be carried out without fuss or bother".
The booklet also points out that although locals may often strip off on hot days at the beach, that does not mean wearing little clothing translates to having "low moral standards".
It describes the concepts of "mateship" (a friend but also a total stranger), a "fair go", and the much-loved ritual of having a "barbie".
It claims another defining feature of Australian society is its egalitarian nature and Australians' informal relationship with work colleagues.
"However, this informality does not extend to physical contact. When meeting someone for the first time, it is usual to shake the person's right hand with your right hand. People who do not know each other generally do not kiss or hug when meeting."
The importance of good manners and good hygiene are also explained. Not blowing your nose on the street gets a mention, as does washing your hands before eating and after going to the toilet, and saying "thank you" or "please" when dealing with others.
"Australians also queue or line up when waiting to be served in a shop, a bank, a government department, a cinema or anywhere a number of people are all seeking a service at the same time."
The peak eating times of the day are spelt out:
"The midday meal is called 'lunch', and the evening meal is usually called 'dinner'. Some Australians also refer to the evening meal as 'tea' and can use the term to mean either dinner or, literally, a cup of tea or 'cuppa'. If invited for tea, the time of the event is a good sign of whether your host means dinner or just a cup of tea. An invitation to tea, any time after 6 pm (1800 hours) usually means dinner."
Is there a typical Australian, asks the booklet?
Well, what with the ocker, the digger and his mate, it can all be a bit confusing.
Just remember:
"Australians are egalitarian, irreverent people with a deep suspicion of authority - yet they are mostly law-abiding and conformist."
Oh, and we all love the bush but most of us live in cities on the coast.
Bonza!
