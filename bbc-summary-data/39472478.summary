[SN]TITLE[SN]
Gruffalo illustrator Axel Scheffler sells original work for charity

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An original artwork by the illustrator of the Gruffalo books is being auctioned for an arts charity.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The depiction of Tiddler - another of Gruffalo author Julia Donaldson's characters - will be sold in Bridge of Allan later this month.
Money raised from the sale of Axel Scheffler's drawing will go to Artlink Central.
The charity provides arts programmes for adults and children with additional support needs.
Mr Scheffler said: "Art is so important for everyone; I think it's wonderful what Artlink Central do, especially for children.
"Julia has been a major supporter of the charity for many years now and I am always happy to help when I can.
"I really hope the auction piece will do well on the night. It's an alternative version of an illustration for the book Tiddler, which features a little grey fish who loves to tell tall tales."
He added: "Often I start a picture for a book but I don't finish it, I don't always know why.
"But if I like it, like this one, I will go back and finish it later. Sometimes the ones which don't go into the books are even better."
