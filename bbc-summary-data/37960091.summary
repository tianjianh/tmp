[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Brian Graham opened the scoring after just eight minutes and Chris Higgins turned a John McGinn effort into his own net just before the break.
David Gray prodded in the third goal seven minutes into the second half.
Martin Boyle, who missed several good chances in the first half, completed the scoring from 12 yards.
With nearest challengers Dundee United dropping points at Cappielow, it was a good day for Neil Lennon's men.
Queen of the South topped the table at one stage but remain sixth after their fifth successive league defeat.
Hibs started at a great tempo, with Andrew Shinnie and Boyle combining to test goalkeeper Lee Robinson in the opening minute. But the home fans didn't have to wait too long for the opener.
Darren McGregor's shot was blocked a yard off the line by Grant Anderson but Graham, making a rare start up front, was at hand to knock the ball high into the net.
Boyle's pace was causing all sorts of problems for Queens and twice when clean through on goal he was denied by Robinson.
There was a warning for the hosts when Mark Millar's strike crashed off the base of the post. However, Hibs continued to dominate and notched a second on 42 minutes.
McGinn fired in a shot from 12 yards on the angle that looked net-bound but was helped over the line by Higgins.
Boyle had a glorious chance to score number three before half time but inexplicably scooped the ball over the crossbar from six yards out with the goal gaping.
Within eight minutes of the second half Hibernian did find the net for the third time. A corner was swung low into the box from the right and captain Gray flicked the ball home with an outstretched left leg.
Lennon decided to give Jason Cummings a run from the bench with the points safe but it was the player keeping the club's top scorer out of the team who had the final say.
Boyle once again skipped between two Queens defenders on the edge of the box before smashing the ball home.
Hibernian manager Neil Lennon: "It was one of the best performances in my time as a manager. I thought we were awesome today. It could have been five at half-time. We never took our foot off the pedal. Some of our attacking play was outstanding. We looked a very very good side today. We looked strong, we looked quick, we looked hungry, everything you want as a manager.
"I think we got what we deserved. I think Martin Boyle could have had four before half-time. It was a wee test of his character. He could have sat in the dressing room at half time and felt sorry for himself but he came out and scored a great goal.
"That is the benchmark now. I asked them in the dressing room Can you live up to that? We have been playing well now for some time but nobody wants to listen. I think anyone here today could see we are a good side."
QotS caretaker boss Jimmy Thomson: "We were under no illusions coming here. Hibs are a good team but when you give them a goal after seven minutes it makes it very difficult. I think it was individual errors. When you ask people to pick people up at corners and they don't do it you have problems.
"Our league position will not be defined by playing here and not getting a win. I wouldn't be interested in the job full time. I have other things going on but taking the job would be very restricting."
