Two X Factor New Zealand judges, who were sacked for making abusive comments to a contestant, have apologised.

Natalia Kills and husband Willy Moon were fired by broadcaster TV3 after the pair laid into singer Joe Irvine.
He'd just performed his version of Michael Buble's Cry Me A River.
"A lot goes on behind-the-scenes of a reality show and what you see isn't always the whole story," said Kills in a statement on her Twitter account.
"The show brought me on to bring my passion, dramatic expression and perspective. I was encouraged to be outspoken and things got out of hand.
"Joe, I hope you can forgive me and I wish you all the best! Be natural, unconventional and be you! Love, Natalia Kills."
During the show Kills criticised Irvine saying: "As an artist who respects artists' integrity and intellectual property I am disgusted at how much you have copied my husband.
"From the hair, to the suit, do you not have any value or respect for originality?
"You're a laughing stock. It's cheesy, it's disgusting. I personally found it absolutely artistically atrocious.
"I am embarrassed to be sitting here in your presence, even having to dignify you with an answer of my opinion."
Moon joined in the tirade, saying it felt cheap and absurd and "like Norman Bates dressing up in his mother's clothing".
The audience mostly booed the judges' commentary and Irvine said he thought "he looked good".
Willy Moon also released a statement on his Twitter account saying: "The reality of 'reality' TV is that there's a lot the viewer doesn't see.
"The show encourages judges to be forthright and highly opinionated. It went too far and I never intended to single anyone out.
"I wish the contestants, crew, and particularly Joe, all the best. With love, Willy Moon."
Natalie Bassingthwaighte and Shelton Woolright have been announced as the new The X Factor NZ judges joining Mel Blatt and Stan Walker.
Bassingthwaighte, 39, used to play Izzy in Neighbours and fronted Australian electro-pop band, Rogue Traders, until 2008 when she went solo.
"I am thrilled to be joining The X Factor New Zealand family and I can't wait to begin mentoring my boys," she said.
"We are going to have the so much fun and I'm so excited to see their talents evolve. I have a few tricks up my sleeve that I hope will see them through to the very end of the competition."
Woolright is the drummer in I Am Giant and has previously played in Blindspott.
He said: "I am absolutely stoked to be involved in X Factor NZ and I'm especially looking forward to working with the Groups.
"I've been working with labels, filmmakers and publishers as well as producing I Am Giant and other bands for years and I can't wait to share my expertise with fresh eager minds. This is going to be awesome, and we are going to win."
