The 22-year-old beat world number 65 Varvara Lepchenko 6-4 6-1 in qualifying for the Aegon Classic in Birmingham.
The Briton's last victory against a top-100 player came against the Czech Republic's Klara Koukalova in Beijing in September 2013.
"I didn't have a lot of confidence going into the match," admitted Robson.
"I haven't won a lot recently but I know how well I've been playing on the practice court and it was just a matter of translating that into a match.
"I stuck to it pretty well. I'm looking not just to win one match, obviously, so tomorrow is a big one as well and I'll try to get another win."
Robson has struggled since a serious wrist injury sidelined her for 17 months.
Currently ranked 308th in the world, Robson reached a career-high 27 in July 2013, but her victory on Saturday was a rare high-point since then.
The first set went with serve until Robson broke the Uzbekistan-born player to claim it.
Robson was broken in the opening game of the next set, but stormed back to break three times en route to an emphatic victory.
The eight-day tournament includes former Wimbledon finalist Agnieszka Radwanska and defending champion Angelique Kerber.
British number one Johanna Konta will face wildcard Tara Moore in the first round. Moore was beaten in the Nottingham Open quarter-finals by China's Saisa Zheng, on Saturday.
