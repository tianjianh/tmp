[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Edward Stokes, 29, was critically injured near The Army and Navy pub in Plaistow at about 00.10 GMT on Saturday.
He was taken to hospital for treatment, along with three other injured men, but died.
A post-mortem examination is expected to take place on Monday. Ten people have been arrested and bailed.
Detective Ch Insp Cliff Lyons said: "Although ten people have been arrested and are currently being questioned, it is believed that two men involved in the attack fled the scene prior to the arrival of the emergency services being alerted and we are keen to trace them."
"Whilst we are aware that a fight broke out prior to these four males being injured, what instigated the fight resulting in the death of Edward is unclear at this stage and we are retaining an open mind."
An 18-year-old old man was later discharged from hospital. Two others - aged 19 and 37 - are still being treated for injuries not believed to be serious.
The Met said six women and four men arrested in connection with the incident had all been released on bail until April.
