[SN]TITLE[SN]
Dagenham & Redbridge 1-2 Guiseley

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Dagenham missed the chance to close the gap on National League pacesetters Lincoln as they slipped to defeat against Guiseley at Victoria Road.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Jordan Preston dented the Daggers' hopes of moving level with the FA Cup heroes after just 12 minutes.
His fine curling strike beat Dagenham goalkeeper Elliot Justham and things got even worse for the hosts when Corey Whitely was sent off for an altercation with Connor Brown three minutes later.
Preston got his second of the afternoon just after the break to end Dagenham's five-match winning run, although the visitors pulled one back in stoppage-time through Ollie Hawkins.
