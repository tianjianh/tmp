The new tenants of the house where athlete Oscar Pistorius shot dead his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp have been filmed giving a tour around the house.

In the video, they promise to host parties there, saying: "Oscar built this house to entertain".
Pistorius family spokeswoman Anneliese Burgess described the footage as "bizarre" to the South African press.
David Scott and Kagiso Mokoape have apologised after giving the South African TV channel Netwerk24 a tour.
However, the pair told the Rekord newspaper they had been assured that they were not being recorded.
"They came to the house to interview us to promote our business. We were relaxed and giving our own opinion as they told us they were not recording," Mr Scott said.
Mr Mokoape told the paper that the purpose of the video had been to send out a positive message that people "should enjoy and celebrate life".
The business partners give the TV channel a tour of the house, including the bathroom where Ms Steenkamp died, whilst holding cans of beer.
At one point Mr Scott says: "This is definitely an entertainer's house."
In another part of the video he told the channel: "Hot girls can invite themselves."
Mr Scott also said they intended to decorate the house "in honour of what happened here".
A version of the video is still on the network's English language website.
During the video, Mr Scott opens the toilet door, through which Ms Steenkamp was shot four times, to show where she died.
While in the bathroom, Mr Mokoape says "I feel bad for Reeva's parents".
The bathroom has since been refurbished.
An online poll by the South African website IOL found that readers were closely split on whether it would be distasteful to hold a party at the house.
The South African parole board is due to decide later this week whether to release Pistorius on house arrest.
He was convicted of manslaughter last year but cleared of murder.
The appeal against his acquittal on murder charges is to be heard next month.
The Olympic athlete insists he mistook his then girlfriend for an intruder.
