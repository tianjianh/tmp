Blackburn Rovers have ended the season-long loan spell of Norway winger Martin Samuelsen and he has returned to parent club West Ham United.

The 19-year-old joined Rovers in August, but he made just two starts in four outings at Ewood Park.
He scored for the Hammers against Rovers in Premier League Two on Monday.
"Martin's family felt that he wanted to be starting games and at this moment in time we couldn't guarantee him that," boss Owen Coyle told the club website.
"So we agreed that it was in his best interest to return to West Ham. He's a great lad and we wish him well."
