A man walking in a forest in Florida, America, has captured a rare image of a raccoon appearing to stand and ride on the back of an alligator.

Richard Jones was walking with his family in the Ocala National Forest when they spotted the alligator.
He snapped the picture just at the right moment before the racoon jumped off and the alligator went underwater.
"Without the context you'd think the raccoon was hitching a ride across the river," he said to a local TV station.
