Jersey telecom company customers 'would change' home phone

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The majority of people responding to a survey said they would change home phone provider if given the chance.

The biannual survey is produced by the Channel Islands Competition and Regulatory Authorities (CICRA).
Just over a third of people responding to the survey rated Jersey's only fixed line telecom company as satisfactory.
JT, owned by Jersey's government, is to face competition in the home phone market from June for the first time and 70% say they would change provider.
A similar survey in Guernsey of sole fixed line operator Sure, found 26% would change if they had the choice.
CEO Graeme Miller disputed the findings of the survey, saying the company's own customer survey had different results - but still showed a need to improve.
He said he was confident their work to improve customer services was working. He said he would be offering a free service to a customer if they break their commitment to improve their service.
CICRA director Louise Read has called on JT to create an action plan to improve customer satisfaction levels.
She said: "Our expectation was that operators value their customers and would initiate improvements themselves.
"This second round of survey results suggest that either JT has not initiated improvements or that the improvements it has made have not yet translated into improved customer satisfaction ratings.
"This is particularly disappointing."
Mr Miller said: "Our data shows the service we are delivering to customers is steadily improving."
