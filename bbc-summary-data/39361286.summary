Germany's Tommy Haas was playing Jiri Vesely of the Czech Republic when their first-round match was interrupted by an iguana, which suddenly appeared on the courtside scoreboard.
Haas even managed a selfie with the adventurous lizard before the match resumed - Vesely eventually going through  6-7 (5-7) 6-3 7-5.
