"Donald J Trump is calling for a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country's representatives can figure out what is going on," Mr Trump, the frontrunner for the Republican presidential nomination, said.
Social media, in fact just about all media, is awash with criticism. Here is a flavour of the reaction around the globe.
Today Show host Willie Geist asked Mr Trump how he imagined people could be identified by their religion...
...and here's the clever part:
For many, Mr Trump's idea raised unwanted memories of the US wartime internment of Japanese citizens.

And the Times of Israel courted controversy with the use of this unmistakable image. The image was later replaced, but not before it had been widely shared.
Fans of Harry Potter suggested dealing with Mr Trump by denying him publicity, comparing him to that book's villain - whose name is taboo.
Harry Potter author JK Rowling caught wind of the comparison, and tweeted to say it was a disservice to evil Lord Voldemort.
US satirical newspaper The Onion made the sobering point that Mr Trump's divisive remarks could push American Muslims towards radicalisation.
Many people pointed out that Mr Trump has appeared to be really quite comfortable with Muslim Americans when it suits him.
And finally, some simply relied on a good joke to take the wind out of Mr Trump's sails..
