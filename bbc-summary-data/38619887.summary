[SN]TITLE[SN]
Barnet 0-0 Newport County

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Newport County survived a late Barnet onslaught to claim a second successive draw in League Two.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
David Pipe went close for bottom club County in a scoreless first half, but after the break eighth-placed Barnet took control.
Goalkeeper Joe Day was County's hero, saving brilliantly to foil Simeon Akinola and making an outstanding double stop to deny Mauro Vilhete.
John Akinde fired wide in the dying minutes for The Bees.
Newport County manager Graham Westley told BBC Radio Wales: "Before you become a winning side you've got to be an unbeaten side, a side that's difficult to play against and proud of its clean sheets.
"And I think in the past couple of games you've seen a side that's worked very hard at its defensive aspects.
"When you go away from home you're going to be under the cosh to an extent, but I thought it was a very determined and a very dogged performance."
