[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man has died following crashes involving several vehicles on the M40 in Warwickshire.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Four cars and two lorries were involved in crashes near Leamington Spa just after midnight.
The collisions left the motorway closed in both directions between junctions 15 and 16.
Two lanes of the southbound carriageway - between the M42 turning and junction 15 for Warwick - remain closed for resurfacing work.
Drivers were urged to consider alternative routes.
West Midlands Ambulance described the scene of the accident as complex and distressing.
It said the first crash involved a lorry and a car.
A spokesman said: "When crews arrived at the scene, they found wreckage over three lanes and the lorry was on fire.
"The car was also destroyed by fire."
The car driver was confirmed dead at the scene.
A second crash happened in the queuing traffic about a mile away.
A car crashed down an embankment following a collision and the engine caught fire.
The ambulance service said a fire crew going to the first crash put out the fire.
The closure of the motorway led to congestion and delays on the A435 between the Coventry Highway and the Warwick Highway, the A3400 between Lapworth and Henley-in-Arden and the A4189 Stratford Road in Henley-in-Arden.
