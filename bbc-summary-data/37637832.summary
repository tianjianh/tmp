Henderson was skipper for Southgate's second game in charge, a 0-0 draw in Slovenia on Tuesday after a 2-0 win against Malta on Saturday.
Southgate, 46, has the job initially for four games after he succeeded Sam Allardyce in September.
"The manager has been brilliant. The players have got on really well with him this week," said Henderson, 26.
"We need to put in the performances, not just for ourselves, but the fans and him and the coaching staff as well to make sure we keep working together for a long time."
Southgate - who said after the Slovenia game that he has "inherited a mess" - gave the Reds midfielder the captain's armband after dropping Manchester United forward Wayne Rooney to the bench.
Former Middlesbrough manager Southgate said: "It's been a remarkable experience. And I feel stronger and more confident for it, and I recognise the responsibility it brings."
He now has a World Cup qualifier against Scotland at Wembley on 11 November and a friendly against Spain four days later to persuade the Football Association to give him the job full time.
"He gives responsibility to players and he listens. It's been a good week," said Henderson.
"It would have been better with two wins, but we've got to take the positives; beating Malta and getting a good point from this game."

Southgate stepped up from his role as England Under-21 boss to take temporary control of the senior team following Allardyce's departure.
Allardyce, 61, left his post after just one game and 67 days following a Daily Telegraph investigation claiming he offered advice on how to "get around" rules on player transfers.
That followed England's disastrous Euro 2016 campaign, which saw Roy Hodgson resign after an embarrassing last-16 defeat by minnows Iceland.
