[SN]TITLE[SN]
Two Kingswells bus services to be withdrawn by First Aberdeen

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Buses serving the Aberdeen suburb of Kingswells will be withdrawn in April, First Aberdeen has announced.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A consultation on the future of the X40 and 11 routes was launched in September last year.
First Aberdeen said "consistently low passenger numbers" and downturn in the local economy made the services unsustainable, and expressed "deep regret".
The last day of the routes will be 1 April.
