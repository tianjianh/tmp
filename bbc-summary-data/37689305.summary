The Borg El Arab Stadium will host the match on Sunday 13 November.
Restrictions on fans at matches in Egypt have been in place since 2012, when 72 Al Ahly fans died in violence at a match in Port Said.
The EFA will also allow 40,000 fans to watch the Champions League final second leg also in Alexandria.
Zamalek will host that match against South African side Mamelodi Sundowns on Sunday 23 October.
The first leg ended in a 3-0 defeat for the Egyptian side.
Egypt fared better in their opening World Cup qualifier, beating DR Congo 2-1 to move into an early two-point lead in Group E.
Only the group winners will earn a place at the tournament in Russia.
