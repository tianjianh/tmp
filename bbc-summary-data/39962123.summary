All-rounder Brown, 19, and batsman Lawlor, 21, are both products of Glamorgan's Academy, having graduated through the Development Programme.
The pair are currently studying at Cardiff Metropolitan University and are part of the Cardiff MCCU set up.
Both featured against Glamorgan in the first-class encounter earlier in the season.
"At the moment we are fortunate to have a number of talented young Welsh cricketers coming through our system and Connor and Jeremy are very good examples of that," said Glamorgan chief executive and director of cricket Hugh Morris.
"Over the last year we have contracted six home-grown cricketers, which bodes well for the future of the club and displays our ambition to produce and nurture young Welsh talent.
"We've seen players like Lukas Carey, David Lloyd and Aneurin Donald thrive in the team, so opportunities are available and we expect to see more products from our highly rated Academy playing for Glamorgan in the future."
