Cardiff schools catchment change plan

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The catchment areas of a number of primary and secondary schools in Cardiff could be changed to match demand for places.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Cardiff council is consulting on changes for primary and secondary schools in the Canton and Llandaff areas of the city.
If given the go-ahead, it would affect those applying for places for the September 2017 school year.
But parents have started a campaign and petition to oppose the plans.
The council said projections for the coming years showed demand for some schools would be higher than places available, while at others it would be less.
However, a group of parents have set up the campaign group Fitzalan 4 Canton to oppose the changes, saying it would impact on communities.
Sharon Parry, whose daughter Rosie, 10, had expected to follow her two older sisters to Fitzalan, said: "We're aware Cardiff council is facing a huge challenge because of a rapidly changing demographic and I understand you have to move and change and adapt.
"But this isn't a simple process of moving numbers around.
"You have to look at the impact for the children, for the community and for the schools involved."
Caroline Evans, who has two sons at Fitzalan, and a third son who will move there in September, said she was "really concerned" about the impact on the school.
"The school has a really good cultural mix - and I think that is what makes the school so important," she said.
"Removing the two of the closest primary schools from the catchment area seems ridiculous. I think a lot of parents feel that way."
Councillor Sarah Merry, cabinet member for education, said the council must continually review catchment areas to ensure it meets the changing demand for education.
Parents can have their say on the proposals until 1 March.
