Some of women's football's biggest names have celebrated the life of Sylvia Gore at a memorial match.

A pioneer of the women's game, Gore was involved in football for more than 60 years and scored the first official goal for the England women's team.
She died on 9 September, aged 71.
Former Everton and England player, Kelly McDougall, who played in the match at Walton Hall Park, said the "fiercely determined true sportswoman" had been her inspiration.
"[Sylvia] was pivotal in the women's game and drove it forward, never stopping in her determination to push for equality, recognition and the highest of standards," McDougall said.
McDougall said Gore took her "under her wing" aged five. She thanked the "warm and caring" woman with "a heart of gold "who gave her "the direction and belief" that she was good enough.
"The game has lost an amazing sportswoman and person. We will never forget you and all that you did for us and we truly thank you for giving us the belief to follow our football dream," she said.
Born on Merseyside, Sylvia Gore started playing for Manchester Corinthians in the late 1950s.
She played through the Football Association's 50-year ban on the women's game and continued to be involved when the FA took over the Women's Football Association in 1993.
Known as the "Denis Law of women's football", she once scored 134 goals in a season.
In 1972, Gore scored England women's first goal during a 3-2 victory against Scotland in Greenock.
After her playing days Gore was Wales manager, an FA Women's Committee member for 20 years and was named Manchester City Women's FC Club ambassador in March.
She was made an MBE in the 2000 New Year honours and inducted into the National Football Museum Hall of Fame in 2014.
