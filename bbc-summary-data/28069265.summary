Officers said a 60-year-old man had been arrested in Widegates, near Looe, on suspicion of firearms offences.
Earlier, dozens of officers were involved in an armed manhunt for Derrel Weaver, who went missing following a "domestic" incident on Thursday night.
Police had warned people not to approach Mr Weaver, an Elvis impersonator.
In a statement, Devon and Cornwall Police said the 60-year-old man was arrested on land in Widegates shortly before 21:30 BST on Friday.
Two firearms were recovered nearby, the force said.
The man has been taken to hospital for a medical assessment as a precaution.
Police are not looking for anybody else in connection with the incident.
Mr Weaver was being sought after a domestic-related incident at his home, Higher Widlake Farm in Widegates.
Officers said it was unclear whether Mr Weaver was armed but it was a possibility as he is a licensed firearms owner.
There was a high police presence in the Widegates and wider Looe area throughout Friday, including firearms officers and trained local officers.
The nearby Trenode Church of England Primary School was closed as a precaution.
The school has 75 pupils.
