Guidolin, who has previously managed Udinese and Monaco, was appointed Swansea's head coach in January.
Swansea are 15th in the Premier League but have won back-to-back games since the Italian's arrival to move four points clear of the relegation zone.
"It's an important challenge because this is the most important league in the world," he said.
"In Italy I have had many experiences but this is a different league and a good challenge.
"The Premier League was a dream for me."
The 60-year-old managed several clubs in Italy from 1988 to 2014, including Palermo and Parma as well as two spells with Udinese.
Udinese finished third in Serie A under Guidolin in 2012, equalling the club's best season in the Italian top-flight.
He also achieved promotions with Parma, Palermo and Vicenza, and led the latter to an unlikely victory in the Coppa Italia in 1997.
Guidolin does not think his side will have an advantage when they face West Bromwich Albion in the Premier League on Tuesday, despite not playing at the weekend.
West Brom were held to a 2-2 draw by Peterborough United in the FA Cup fourth round on Saturday, but the Swans exited the cup in the previous round.
"We've had more days to prepare but there's no difference," Guidolin said.
West Brom's Welsh manager Tony Pulis made four changes for his side's FA Cup tie.
Pulis' side are seven points above the drop zone and defeat at the Liberty Stadium could drag the Baggies into a relegation scrap.
Swansea are one place and three points behind 14th-placed West Brom and four points clear of the bottom three.
"I'm very happy at the moment," Guidolin added. "The table wasn't good but with two victories the table is better.
"Now we have another difficult match against a good team. If we win, it will be very important but it will be difficult."
