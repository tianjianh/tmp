The Briton had triumphed in the 800m freestyle on Thursday in Israel and followed that up with a thrilling win over Hungary's Katinka Hosszu.
The 25-year-old from Wales clocked a time of three minutes 58.81 seconds, beating Hosszu by 0.03 seconds,
There was also a silver for Chris Walker-Hebborn after he finished joint second in the 50m backstroke.
Walker-Hebborn and Italy's Simone Sabbioni both clocked 23.09 behind Poland's Tomasz Polewka (22.96).
It means GB finish the meeting with 11 medals - two golds, seven silvers and two bronzes.
Carlin had gone out strongly in her race behind Hosszu and Femke Heemskerk of the Netherlands and was second at the halfway point before taking the lead at the 250m mark.
Hosszu edged ahead with 50m left but Carlin finished strongly to get the better of her rival and add to the bronze she won at the World Championships in Kazan in August. Her team-mate Hannah Miley finished sixth.
