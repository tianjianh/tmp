James Dayton's superb freekick had seemed likely to earn Gary Johnson's men a valuable point.
The hosts took the lead when Javan Vidal touched home Simon Heslop's drive from distance in his first start after recovering from stomach surgery.
York scored in the final minute of added-time as the Wrexham substitute turned in Blaine Hudson's header.
Cheltenham remain two points clear of second-placed Forest Green at the top of the National League with Wrexham up to eighth, three points behind Dover, who occupy the final play-off spot.
Wrexham manager Gary Mills told BBC Radio Wales: "I thought from the first minute to the last, we showed the fans we still believe.
"I thought we were awesome today. We were the better side, when we could play, we played.
"It took a good goal for them to score, but we kept going.
"We have still got a chance of the play-offs."
Cheltenham Town boss Gary Johnson told BBC Radio Gloucestershire: "I thought we were unlucky because we were part of a decent football match - we didn't quite have the quality on the day to get enough chances.

"You always feel hard done by when you've lost a game but they're not competing with us up there. It would have been nice to have got the points but it makes it still interesting. You're not going to win every game, certainly not against the top teams.
"I've got to make sure we pick the lads up. I'll slap their wrists now but we'll pick them up and we've got to be ready for another big game against Grimsby."
