Former YouTube star and musician Alex Day has posted a video online seven months after admitting "manipulative" relationships.

Several YouTube contributors have criticised Alex Day for the 31-minute-video entitled The Past.
The 25-year-old begins by saying "I'd like to talk about some things that happened" but later acknowledges it "won't be enough for many people".
In March 2014, Alex Day denied any sexual contact with underage girls.
The musician, whose channel has more than one million subscribers, has had three top 40 hits in the UK.
He said he wanted to defend himself after several young women he'd had "sexual experiences" with wrote about it online.
"The main thing that came out was was that they all felt I was manipulative," he said.
"Some of them felt pressured, not physically but emotionally, into doing the things that we did."
In the video, filmed in a park, Alex Day said he had decided to speak out after "losing friends".
"I've never really cared about what people think of me," he said.
Alex, previously known online as nerimon, insists he never intended to put pressure on women.
"All I can say to that is that I didn't mean to make anyone feel pressured and that I'm really sorry for making anyone feel pressured and it was not my intention.
"I'm not a rapist, I'm not a sexual predator, I've never forced anyone to do anything if I understood they didn't want to."
Several YouTube contributors, including one woman claiming to have been abused by Alex Day, have criticised his response.
Referring to one specific accusation, Alex Day addresses the issue of consent.
"The point is she felt like she couldn't [say no] for reasons that I still don't fully understand, but I'll try my best to make sure no one feels like that again."
Towards the end of the video, the vlogger suggests there will be more from him to come.
He said he will "keep making videos as long as I have things to say".
In March, Charlie McDonnell who used to share a house with Day, released a statement about his behaviour.
"In the time that I knew Alex, I never had any notion that the girls he was with were anything other than happily consenting to being with him," he said.
"The idea that anything contrary to that was going on behind closed doors makes me incredibly unhappy, and with that, I just don't feel able to call Alex a friend of mine any more."
Charlie McDonnell was one of several high-profile YouTubers to make videos as part of a campaign tackling issues such as consent, sexting and controlling behaviour.
The videos were part of the This is Abuse campaign, which seeks to raise awareness of what a damaging relationship looks like and were specifically aimed at teenage boys.
Alex Day has also been criticised for allowing adverts to be featured alongside his video, meaning he will profit from views.
He defended this by stating on his channel that "I trust myself to do good things with the money that comes from that".
In a blog by YouTube Speaks, a group discussing abuse on the video sharing site, people were encouraged to view an alternative version without adverts.
