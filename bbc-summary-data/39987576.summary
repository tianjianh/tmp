This will be the Lochaber side's first MacTavish final for seven years, offering them the chance to claim the cup for the first time since 1969.
Kyles went a point clear in the Marine Harvest Premiership despite dropping their first point in a 1-1 draw with Oban Camanachd after Kingussie went down 2-0 to champions Newtonmore in the Badenoch derby.
Lochaber gained their first points when they came back from two goals down for a 3-2 away win over Glenurquhart. Lovat defeated Glasgow Mid Argyll 2-0 at Kiltarlity.
Fort William's 2-0 replay victory away to Oban Celtic sent them through to a home tie against holders Newtonmore in the Camanachd Cup.
Kilmallie had a dream start in their MacTavish last-four clash with a fourth-minute goal from Duncan Rodger, and stayed in front for an hour until Finlay MacRae equalised.
Michael Rodger and Calum MacDougall gave Kilmallie a vital cushion in the dying minutes and MacRae's second for Shiel in stoppage time was too little, too late. Shiel, albeit with just five games played, still have a 100% league record, while Kilmallie sit second-bottom and will celebrate a major upset as well as a senior cup final appearance.
In the Premiership, Roddy MacDonald opened early for Kyles but the Tughnabruich side lost their 100% record to a Daniel MacVicar equaliser in the second half.
Glen MacKintosh scored a goal in each half for Newtonmore, who have had a difficult start to the season but denied local rivals Kingussie the opportunity to go top of the table with this derby triumph.
In Drumnadrochit, Glenurquhart looked to be moving further clear of bottom side Kilmallie when Neale Reid and James MacPherson put them 2-0 up midway through the first half.
Lochaber's fightback began with a Brennan MacDonald penalty before second-half goals from Shaun Nicholson and Kevin Ferguson gave them their first points at the seventh time of asking.
Lewis Tawse got a goal in each half to secure Lovat's 2-0 success over Glasgow Mid Argyll.
Alex MacMillan in the first half and Bryan Simpson in the second scored the goals in Oban which sent lower league Fort William through to their Camanachd Cup encounter with Newtonmore at An Aird.
In the second round of the Balliemore Cup, shinty's intermediate championship, Inveraray defeated Bute 3-0. In round three, Caberfeidh swept Inverness aside 6-0 at Strathpeffer with hat-tricks from Kevin Bartlett and Craig Morrison.
Jack MacDonald and Kieran MacTavish got two each as Beauly won 5-1 at Taynuilt.
