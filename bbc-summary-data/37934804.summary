Actor Michael Douglas accepted the inaugural Teddy Kollek Award for the Advancement of Jewish Culture on his father's behalf, saying he would be "so proud and so humbled".
Vice President Joe Biden also received an award at a dinner held at New York's Pierre Hotel on Wednesday.
Douglas was born Issur Danielovitch in New York on 9 December 1916.
His parents were Jewish immigrants who came to America from a part of the former Russian Empire that is now Belarus.
Kirk Douglas was seen last month at a charity event in Los Angeles in aid of the Motion Picture and Television Fund.
Kollek, the mayor of Jerusalem from 1965 to 1993, was a long-time friend of the Spartacus and Paths of Glory star.
