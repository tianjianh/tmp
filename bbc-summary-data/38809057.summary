[SN]TITLE[SN]

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Police in Forth Valley have condemned the "potentially fatal" actions of a group of youths who threw a brick at a lorry from a motorway bridge.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The brick hit a fully-laden HGV which was travelling along the M80 before junction 7 at Haggs, near Falkirk, at about 20:30 on 23 January.
The vehicle was damaged but the driver managed to maintain control of the lorry and parked on the hard shoulder.
Officers said several youths were seen to throw the brick from the bridge.
Insp Andrew Thomson, from the division's road policing unit, said: "This type of reckless behaviour is extremely dangerous and has potentially fatal consequences for the motorway road users.
"This brick thrown onto the motorway could very easily have went through the window of this vehicle, causing a catastrophic collision."
