Isis Academy school changes name to avoid terror link

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A school has changed its name from "Isis" because the word has become associated with the so-called Islamic State.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Isis Academy in Oxford said it had rebranded as "Iffley Academy" to protect its "reputation, integrity and image".
The name 'Isis' was originally chosen as the school is near to the section of the River Thames of the same name.
Formerly Iffley Mead School, it became Isis Academy in 2013.
A statement issued by the school said it had changed name following "the unforeseen rise of ISIS (also known as ISIL and the Islamic State) and related global media coverage of the activities of the group".
"Our priority is to remove the detrimental impact which the name 'Isis' had on pupils, their families and our staff."
Last year a language school in the city removed Isis from its name for the same reason.
The Isis is the name given to the part of the River Thames above Iffley Lock in Oxford. It is also the name of the goddess wife of the god Osiris in Egyptian beliefs.
