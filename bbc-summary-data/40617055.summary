The 31-year-old man was stabbed during a clash in which shots were also fired in King William Walk, Greenwich, in the early hours of Saturday morning.
One attacker was said to have had a gun while the other had a knife.
The man managed to make his way to a nearby house to ask for help. Emergency services were called, but he died at the scene.
Officers believe they know who the victim is but are awaiting confirmation that next of kin have been told.
Det Insp Jo Sidaway, who is leading the investigation, said: "During an altercation between the suspects and the victim, the victim was stabbed.
"The suspected firearm was discharged, but inquiries continue regarding this."
A post-mortem examination is to be held later.
Anyone with information has been urged to contact police.
The killing is the latest crime to where the alleged perpetrators were riding a moped or scooter.
It follows a string of acid attacks carried out on Thursday night.
