The 16-year-old was tipped to become a pro and in May fought his way to become the 58kg 2014 champion in the North West Amateur Boxing Association.
The teenager had trained with Gorton Amateur Boxing Club and his head coach Kevin Williams revealed he was "very entertaining and charismatic to watch".
He said: "Macauley was good enough and he had the style to be professional."
Kevin Williams told Newsbeat that he was a brilliant boxer who drew in the crowds but he was also "intelligent and he had a big heart".
Many professional boxers have been expressing their shock at hearing the news of the teenager's death.
WBO Inter-Continental lightweight champion Antony Crolla tweeted: "Woke up to some horrible news. Very sad to hear about Macauley Moran, God bless him #rip"
Pro boxer Frankie Gavin posted a picture with Macauley, tweeting: "Gutted to hear the sad news my lil mate @cauleybox has passed away. Rip mate x"
Macauley had suffered with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and his dad Mario Conway told Newsbeat he had been feeling depressed in the last couple of weeks.
The teenager started boxing at the age of 10 to help him deal with his ADHD.
Mario Conway said: "He used to get into trouble. He needed to think all the time. Boxing helped him."
Macauley hoped to turn pro at 18 and earlier this year he was in the top eight in the country for his age.
Mario revealed his son "could have been world class, he would have been world class".
In a statement, Greater Manchester Police said there were no suspicious circumstances surrounding his death and they had referred his case to the coroner.
