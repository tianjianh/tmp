Police were called to investigate the sudden death of Patrick Dowds, a man in his 60s, on the farm in Toulett, near Burt, in County Donegal on Wednesday.
It is understood he was attacked by the bull as he was inspecting fields.
His twin brother, George, who lived with him on the farm, was taken to Letterkenny General Hospital.
Charlie Doherty, a friend of the Dowds and a neighbouring farmer, said Patrick had gone out to feed the cattle as normal but had not returned home.
It was then that his brother George alerted some neighbours and they went to look for him.
"They seen the nuts used to feed the cattle and the bucket was still there, and not realising that the bull had killed Patrick they went into the field and the bull attacked George," said Charlie.
"The bull threw George into the air and had him on the ground.
"He rolled away from him and then the neighbours' shouting distracted the bull so George was able to get away to safety."
Mr Doherty said the whole community was in shock
"Patrick would be a very happy-go-lucky fella, he was always up for the craic and the banter," he said.
"It's really sad to hear it. It's just a real tragedy and I know the community will rally round and help the family but it's a real shock.
"Both of them lived together, they were single men living at the home farm.
"This is a real farming area and this just shows what a dangerous job it can be. Patrick went out like he went out every other day, thinking he'd come home."
The Donegal Chairman of the Irish Farmers Association, Michael Chance, who knows the family, said it was a tragic accident.
"The man went out yesterday to look at his cattle and, sadly, it appears the bull turned on him with tragic consequences," he said.
"Certain breeds of bulls are considered dangerous. This was a Charolais bull which would normally be considered one of the more docile breeds, but any bull can turn nasty.
"It's just very sad. He was a man who was very well liked by his neighbours and his life revolved around his farm."
