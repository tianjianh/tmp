Druids and pagans were joined by a mass of revellers at the ancient monument to celebrate the spring or vernal equinox.
Open access to the stones was given from first light, 05:45 GMT, by English Heritage which manages the site.
Senior druid King Arthur Pendragon, who performed the sunrise ceremony, said: "We're lucky, we used to get 200 people but now it's up to nearly 1,000."
Despite a cloudy forecast, @Stonehenge tweeted that the gathering had been "blessed with a perfect sunrise".
"A lot of people are coming out to sacred places to celebrate the turning of the wheel, which is what paganism is about,"  said Mr Pendragon.
"We don't worship nature, we worship the divine through nature and so we worship at the times of the year when it's auspicious - spring, summer, autumn and winter."
