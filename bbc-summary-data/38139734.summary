UK Championship 2016: David Gilbert says luck helped him beat Ali Carter

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
David Gilbert said he had luck on his side after recovering from a "useless" start to win a high-quality third-round UK Championship match with Ali Carter at the York Barbican.

The world number 21 trailed 3-0 to the two-time World Championship runner-up.
But Gilbert got on the board with a half century and two tons, and another 50 helped him build a 5-3 lead before he held his nerve in the decider.
"It was looking like it would be an early bath," Gilbert, 35, said.
"But I got a bit lucky going in at 3-1 down and then I actually started playing really well.
"I started off and was useless. Maybe I was too chilled. But it ended up a good game in the second half of the match.
"Ali missed a few in the last frame early on and I kept getting away with it. He made another mistake and I cleared to the black for probably the best clearance I have ever made."
Derby's Gilbert, who is already guaranteed Â£15,000 for his best run at the UK Championship, faces either Ding Junhui or Jamie Jones in the last 16.
"I was a bit lucky, but I will take it. It's a big win for me. It went well in the end. Happy days."
