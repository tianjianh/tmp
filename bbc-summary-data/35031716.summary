There was speculation that the annual competition would be rearranged for this weekend.
However, the GAA announced on Monday that dates for the rescheduled fixtures will be confirmed after a CCCC meeting on 12 January.
The four semi-final encounters on Saturday were called off because of adverse weather conditions.
In football, Munster had been scheduled to face Leinster at Pairc Esler, Newry, while Ulster were due to play Connacht at the Athletic Grounds in Armagh.
The hurling semi-finals involving the four Irish provinces at Pearse Stadium, Salthill, were also postponed.
The finals had been due to take place at Armagh and Salthill on Sunday.
