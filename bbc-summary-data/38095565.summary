Aleena Kauser was walking in Rawtenstall when she was hit by one of two cars travelling at more than 60mph (96km/h) in a 30mph zone.
Adil Manir, 20, has already admitted causing her death by dangerous driving.
Mohsem Saddique, 23, denied the same charge but has been found guilty at Burnley Crown Court.
Aleena was walking on a pavement with her mother along Bacup Road to a mosque when she was struck by Manir's Audi A5 on 18 September 2015.
She was airlifted to the Royal Blackburn Hospital after the crash but later died.
The prosecution said Saddique was tailgating Manir in a Volkswagen Golf immediately before the collision and there was only 6ft (2m) between the cars as they drove at speeds between 55mph and 64mph.
Saddique and Manir, both of Rossendale, are due to be sentenced at the court on 19 December.
Speaking after the hearing, Det Insp Mark Haworth-Oates said the "tragic incident" had had a "devastating impact on Aleena's family and the wider community".
He said: "I'm sure that when Saddique and Manir set out they had no intention of hurting anyone, but their actions showed a complete disregard for the safety of other road users and pedestrians.
"The irresponsible and dangerous way in which they raced their vehicles in a built up area at a busy time of day has led to the worst possible outcome."
