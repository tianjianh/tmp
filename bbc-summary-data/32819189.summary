Neil "Nello" Baldwin - former Stoke City kit man and mascot - and Gordon Banks, England's 1966 goalkeeper and Stoke City president, are being honoured by the city council.
Mr Baldwin, 69, was the subject of a BBC film Marvellous, which won two Baftas earlier this month.
Stoke City said it was "delighted" with the honour.
Banks, 77, was capped 73 times for England. Among his achievements was a "wonder save" from Pele during the 1970 World Cup match against Brazil.
He spent five seasons with Stoke City and lives in the area.
Mr Baldwin, who has learning difficulties, is a lifelong fan of the club.
During the early 1990s, he struck up a friendship with then-manager Lou Macari who gave him a job as kit man and mascot.
The story of his rise to legendary status at the club was dramatised in Marvellous, which starred Toby Jones and won Best Single Drama at the Baftas.
Both men were nominated for the freedom of Stoke-on-Trent by members of the city council in October.
They will be presented with the honour by Deputy Lord Mayor Kath Banks.
The presentation will begin at 19:00 BST.
Potteries pop star Robbie Williams was the last person to be awarded the freedom of Stoke-on-Trent in July.
Stoke City said in a statement: "The dramatisation of Neil's life in Marvellous really painted Stoke City and the city of Stoke-on-Trent in such a positive light.
"He's a wonderful ambassador for the club and the city and proof a positive outlook on life can help you overcome anything.
"We're delighted that Neil has been awarded the freedom of the city of Stoke-on-Trent - it's an honour he thoroughly deserves."
