JCB Transmissions announced three weeks ago 290 jobs were at risk, blaming a global downturn in the market.
But a flexible working pattern for shop floor employees has been put in place until the end of February 2016 to save more than 100 jobs.
GMB members voted in favour of the proposal following a ballot on Friday.
JCB chief executive Graeme Macdonald said: "Our shop floor colleagues are to be applauded for their actions."
