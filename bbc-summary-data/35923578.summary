Plans to tackle transport concerns for Bristol's £92.5m Arena have been revealed.

A decision on the 12,000-capacity venue was deferred by councillors earlier this month because of concerns about how people would get to and from it.
Revised plans include a shuttle service from Bristol Parkway, more bike spaces and stewards to guide pedestrians.
The new proposals will be considered by Bristol City Council's Development Control Committee on 6 April.
The long-awaited city centre venue had been due to open in 2018. But there have been concerns that, without a car park, concert-goers would clog up nearby streets.
In a bid to address this, the city council has allocated £7.75m of the project's budget to fund coach drop-off bays, taxi spaces and increased cycle parking.
It will also make use of park-and-ride sites and work with First Group and Great Western Railway to provide additional buses and a shuttle service to the railway station after events.
