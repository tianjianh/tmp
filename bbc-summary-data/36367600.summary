She tweeted she was "proud to announce" she would be doing an eight-week run.
The Pitch Perfect and Bridesmaids star will play nightclub singer Miss Adelaide in the multi-award winning musical, which first debuted on Broadway in 1950.
Further casting for the show at the Phoenix Theatre will be announced in due course.
Wilson trained at the Australian Theatre for Young People, where she appeared in a number of musicals and plays. She also wrote and performed in her own productions before beginning her film career.
"I saw my first musical at age 14, a show called 42nd Street, after one of my family's dogs had unsuccessfully auditioned to be in it. It blew me away and I've loved musical theatre ever since," the 36-year-old said.
She added that playing "such an iconic role as Miss Adelaide" was "truly an honour".
"Hopefully I crush it, but you'll have to come and see me to find out!"
Set in Prohibition-era New York, Guys and Dolls depicts the city's gamblers, hustlers and nightclub singers. Some of its most famous musical numbers include My Time of Day, Luck Be A Lady and Sit Down You're Rockin' the Boat.
It is currently running in the West End, having moved from Chichester Festival Theatre, and is directed by Gordon Greenberg and choreographed by Carlos Acosta, the former principal with the English National Ballet.
Wilson recently presented a Bafta film award, and made light of the Oscars diversity issue, saying she had been "practising my transgender face" in the hope of winning a future award.
She also played actor Matt Lucas's sister in the hit comedy film Bridesmaids in 2011 and the two were recently housemates for three years in California.
