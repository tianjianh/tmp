Shaw played 85 minutes of Sunday's 3-1 defeat by Watford, after which he was criticised by manager Jose Mourinho.
The Portuguese said the 21-year-old, who returned at the start of the season after breaking his leg last September, was too far away from Nordin Amrabat in the build-up to Watford's second goal.
Shaw has started all five of United's Premier League games so far.
The Red Devils, who have lost their past three matches, play League One side Northampton at Sixfields in the third round of the EFL Cup on Wednesday.
