A man in his 50s from Wirrel was airlifted to Ysbyty Gwynedd, Bangor, with a head injury after the group was rescued by the skipper of another boat at about 10:45 BST on Saturday.
His three sons, aged 18, were also taken to hospital with hypothermia.
Rescuers said the family was "completely unprepared" and had no lifejackets.
