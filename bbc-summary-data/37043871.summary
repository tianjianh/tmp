She has a small role and was added after filming began, according to the Hollywood Reporter, but may have a more significant part to play in its sequel.
The second of the films, both of which are scripted by JK Rowling, was announced earlier this month.
The first instalment is released in the UK and US on 18 November.
It is not known what role Kravitz, who has also previously appeared in Mad Max: Fury Road and is the daughter of musician Lenny Kravitz and actress Lisa Bonet, will play in Fantastic Beasts.
The film series stars Eddie Redmayne as wizarding world magizoologist Newt Scamander, who writes the famous Hogwarts School textbook that gives the film its title.
Warner Bros has said the second film "moves deeper into an increasingly dark time for the wizarding world".
Rowling, who is making her screenwriting debut, previously said the Fantastic Beasts films - inspired by her 2001 book of the same name - would be a trilogy.
The story is set 70 years before the events of the Harry Potter series.
