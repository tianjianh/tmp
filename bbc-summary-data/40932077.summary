[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Ellis Harrison scored the only goal as League One side Bristol Rovers knocked Fulham out of the EFL Cup in round two.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Harrison collected Liam Sercombe's through ball and rounded keeper Marcus Bettinelli to slot in after 12 minutes.
Fulham had to rely on Bettinelli to keep out Tom Lockyer's attempt from point-blank range.
Neeskens Kabano spurned the Championship side's best chance, firing over before Aboubakar Kamara headed wide late on.
In a game of few chances, Rovers were good value for their surprise win against a disjointed Fulham.
Manager Slavisa Jokanovic opted to make 11 changes to the Fulham side which lost 1-0 to Sheffield Wednesday on Saturday, with new signing Sheyi Ojo making his debut following a loan move from Liverpool.
But they could not find fluency and lacked a cutting edge, causing few problems for Rovers keeper Sam Slocombe.
Fulham have now gone four games without a win and have failed to score in their past three outings.
Match ends, Fulham 0, Bristol Rovers 1.
