NI terrorism: Royal Marine Ciarán Maxwell's detention extended

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Detectives who arrested a serving royal marine in a Northern Ireland-related terrorism investigation have been given a further five days to question him.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Ciarán Maxwell, from Larne, County Antrim, was detained in Somerset on Wednesday by the Metropolitan Police Service's Counter Terrorism Command.
The 30 year old is suspected of preparing for acts of terrorism.
A warrant for further detention was granted to the Met by Westminster Magistrates' Court on Friday.
It means that he can now be held in custody until 12:20 BST on Wednesday 31 August.
Mr Maxwell was taken to a West Country police station immediately after his arrest.
However, a Met spokesman said the royal marine was transferred to a London police station on Thursday.
His arrest is understood to be connected to the discovery of two arms dumps near Larne earlier this year.
The weapons discovered are thought to be linked to dissident republican paramilitaries.
Searches in Devon connected to the arrest are still ongoing.
