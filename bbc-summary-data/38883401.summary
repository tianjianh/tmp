[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Ben Kitto, from Scarborough, had used the laser jamming device on the A64 in North Yorkshire in June.
The 41-year-old pleaded guilty to speeding and attempting to pervert the course of justice at York Crown Court on Monday.
He was given a two-month jail term, suspended for 12 months, and ordered to pay Â£2,200 in fines and costs.
Kitto was also ordered to do 100 hours of unpaid work and was given five penalty points on his driving licence.

The judge, Andrew Stubbs QC, told Kitto that he had "narrowly" avoided jail due to his "exceptional character".
Kitto, the court heard, had raised thousands of pounds for charities in Scarborough.
The jamming device, which could be used to prevent the police from recording a speed, had been fitted beneath the front number plate of his BMW car.
Kitto was estimated to have been driving at between 81.9 and 91mph (131 and 146km/h) on the A64 between Malton and York.
Police realised he had been using a device after reviewing video footage, and Kitto was later arrested at home.
Judge Stubbs told him: "For you it appears the speed limits were an inconvenience.
"This arrogance led you to fill your car with gadgets, both legal and illegal, to allow you to operate outside the law."
