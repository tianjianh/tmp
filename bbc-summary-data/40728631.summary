The 25-year-old previously played in the top flight with Worcester Warriors, and ended last season with the Southern Kings in Super Rugby.
Van der Sluys started just one competitive match for the Warriors and returned to South Africa in March.
"I can't ask for a better club to join. I am looking forward to (this new challenge)," he told the club website.
