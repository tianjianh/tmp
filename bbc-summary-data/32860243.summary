Christi and Bobby Shepherd, of Horbury, near Wakefield, were poisoned at the Louis Corcyra Beach Hotel in 2006.
The hotel said it had decided to demolish the bungalow now "proceedings were over". An inquest last week ruled the pair had been unlawfully killed.
Thomas Cook chief executive Peter Fankhauser met the children's parents after issuing a public apology.
On Friday it emerged the electrician convicted in connection with the deaths had been back working at the hotel complex until his dismissal on Thursday.
In a statement, the hotel said he was "no longer working for the company".
"Now that all proceedings including the inquest are over we have decided to demolish the bungalow," it added.
"This will be done after the hotel operations have ended for the season."
The family of Christi, seven, and Bobby, six, had pleaded for bungalow 112 to be torn down and a playground built in its place. They had asked Thomas Cook to "push through" their request.
Although the company no longer sends British tourists to this hotel, it still provides business for the Louis hotel chain in other resorts.
In 2010 three people, including the manager of the Louis Corcyra Beach Hotel and two members of staff, were found guilty of manslaughter by negligence and sentenced to seven years.
Eight other people were cleared, including two Thomas Cook travel reps.
The children were on holiday at the hotel with their father Neil Shepherd and his now wife, Ruth, when they died.
The inquest heard the faulty boiler had been housed in an outbuilding attached to the side of the bungalow where the family had been staying.
The children's parents had previously criticised the tour firm for not apologising to them directly during the two-week hearing in Wakefield.
On Monday the firm revealed it had donated Â£1.5m to the children's charity Unicef. The money was the remainder after legal costs of a Â£3m damages settlement from the Greek hotel.
On Wednesday Mr Fankhauser had said he was "deeply sorry" about the deaths.
"It is clear that there are things that we as a company could have done better in the past nine years," he added.
He met Mr Shepherd and the children's mother Sharon Wood on Thursday and it was announced the family would receive an undisclosed "financial gesture of goodwill" from the firm.
Mr Shepherd said they planned to make donations to a series of charities.
