Ahmad Al Salih curled home a free-kick in injury time to make it 2-2.
Syria are fourth in their group, three points behind Uzbekistan with two games left to play. Iran have won the group.
The top two teams in the group qualify automatically for next year's World Cup in Russia. The third-placed team would have to win two play-off ties to advance.
World Cup 2022 hosts Qatar shocked South Korea with a 3-2 victory to remain in the hunt for third spot, but China's quest to reach a second World Cup is all but over.
Marcello Lippi's China, who were within reach of only their second win in Group A, are now bottom and need to make up six points to snatch third place.
Qatar, who beat World Cup finals regulars South Korea in Doha, took their tally to seven points and also have an outside chance of finishing third in their group.
Iran booked their place in the finals on Monday night thanks to a 2-0 win over Uzbekistan in Tehran.
