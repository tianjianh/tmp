The Indian-owed manufacturer will replace the outgoing Trulli team for the 2016-17 season.
Formula E is currently in its second year, with Nelson Piquet Jr having won the inaugural 2014-15 championship.
Jaguar have not been involved in top-level motorsport since leaving Formula 1 at the end of 2004.
They are joined by Williams Advanced Racing as official technical partners, part of the group which includes the Williams Formula 1 team.
"Electric vehicles will absolutely play a role in Jaguar Land Rover's future product portfolio and Formula E will give us a unique opportunity to further our development of electrification technologies," said Nick Rogers, JLR's Group engineering director.
Indian conglomerate Tata bought the British-based Jaguar and Land Rover brands in 2008 from Ford, who had previously raced the Jaguar brand in F1 from 2000 to 2004.
After a failing to win a race, the team was sold to Red Bull, who went on to win four Formula 1 constructors' and drivers' championships in successive years.
