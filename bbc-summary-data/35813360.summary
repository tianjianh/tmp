Mathieu Baudry: Leyton Orient appeal against red card at Oxford United

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Leyton Orient have appealed against Mathieu Baudry's straight red card at Oxford United.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Orient won 1-0 at the Kassam Stadium but they ended the match with 10 men after defender Baudry was sent off in injury time.
The 28-year-old Frenchman was dismissed for a tackle on Oxford's Kemar Roofe, but the east London club have challenged the decision.
Their win against the U's lifted Orient into the play-off places.
