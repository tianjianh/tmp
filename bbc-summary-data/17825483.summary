Everton footballer Steven Pienaar has been bailed after answering an arrest warrant issued when he failed to turn up in court on speeding charges.

The allegations, in Essex, against Pienaar, 30, were proven in his absence after he failed to attend Chelmsford Magistrates' Court on Monday.
He was caught speeding twice, 11 days apart, on Lambourne Road, Chigwell.
A judge ordered Pienaar be given unconditional bail for sentencing in Chelmsford next month.
The player's lawyer said his client had "responded immediately" to news of the warrant and made a "pre-arranged visit" to a police station in Cheshire.
Gwynn Lewis said Pienaar was "totally unaware" of the court date, after he moved to Merseyside in February.
He said the correspondence from the court had been sent to his old address in Essex.
Pienaar, whose address was given in court as Theydon Road, Epping, was charged with failing to disclose who was driving his Aston Martin DBS, which was captured exceeding the limit, on two separate days in October last year.
The South Africa international joined his former club Everton, on loan from Tottenham, in January.
