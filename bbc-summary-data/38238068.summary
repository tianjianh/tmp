[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A judge was right to jail three men for their part in violence towards police at an illegal rave in Lincolnshire.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Glen More, 24, Thomas Carling, 19, and Joshua Colman, 22, were part of a large group who clashed with officers attempting to break up the event at Twyford Wood, near Bourne, on 23 June.
The men, who admitted violent disorder, appealed against their jail terms but the application was rejected.
Mr Justice Males said the judge was "entitled" to pass deterrent sentences.

More than 20 officers and a police dog were injured during the incident.
Colman, of Narborough, Norfolk, was jailed for 18 months and Carling, of Corsham, Wiltshire, was jailed for 12 months at a hearing in July.
More, of Stroud, Gloucestershire, was jailed for 12 months in October.
Mr Justice Males said: "It's a matter of great regret when a person of good character takes part in criminal activity that is out of character and quickly regrets.
"That activity and the punishment that follows may cast a blight over the lives of those who are essentially, apart from this occasion, decent young people.
"We recognise the severe consequences for each of the three appellants. A single night of mindless violence may have long-term consequences.
"The fact this was mindless and carried out under the influence of alcohol or drugs was no excuse."
