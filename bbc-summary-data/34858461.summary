The 24-year-old former Arsenal trainee joined up with the Scottish Premiership club at the weekend.
Henderson's contract with the English League Two club expires in January.
Crawley manager Mark Yates said: "I have told him he does not figure in my plans at the moment and I want to give him as much opportunity as possible to get himself sorted out."
Republic of Ireland Under-21 cap Henderson had a spell on loan with Coventry City from Arsenal before switching to Hull City after his release from the London outfit.
He was again farmed out to Stevenage before being released again and then signed for Crawley in summer 2014.
His appearances having been restricted by an ankle injury, Henderson making 19 appearances as the Reds were relegated from League One last season.
And he has only played three times this term after Yates took over from Dean Saunders.
Caley Thistle manager John Hughes is looking to bolster a squad that last season lifted the Scottish Cup but has been badly hit by injuries this season.
In most games this season, Hughes, whose side sit eighth in the Scottish top flight, has not filled all seven substitutes places on his bench.
