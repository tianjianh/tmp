According to Laura, fellow Olympian Jason never spoke to her in training.
In his defence, Jason said that he "never said hello to anyone" and he "can't help being grumpy"!
Don't worry - it all worked out in the end, and the two are planning their wedding.
Watch this clip of the pair answering a question from 10-year-old Newsround fan Brooke.
