[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Senior figures from the BBC are "very likely" to be called before MPs to explain whether changes were made in the wake of the Jimmy Savile scandal.

Jesse Norman said the culture select committee, which he chairs, "needed to be satisfied the culture has changed".
The report into cases of sexual abuse by the former BBC presenter is set to criticise the corporation, according to a leaked draft.
BBC chief Lord Hall said lessons would be learned from a "dark chapter".
News website Exaro claims Dame Janet Smith's draft report says the BBC had a "deferential culture", "untouchable stars" and "above the law" managers.
Lawyer Liz Dux, of Slater and Gordon, which represents 168 Savile victims, said: "It is deeply disturbing that this inquiry appears to have concluded the same culture which allowed Savile to commit his appalling offences with impunity still persists today."
But Dame Janet's team said they were "disappointed" Exaro had published the "early draft".
A statement said the document was out of date and significant changes had been made to its contents and conclusions.
Lord Hall, director general of the BBC, said: "What happened was a dark chapter in the history of the BBC.
"The responsible thing must be to act on the final report which we have not received."
He added that it would be "invaluable in helping us understand what happened and to help ensure that we do everything possible to avoid it happening again".

Dame Janet's review was set up in October 2012 by the BBC to carry out an impartial investigation of the corporation's culture and practices during the years it employed Savile, thought to be from 1964 to 2007.
According to Exaro, Dame Janet does not believe the BBC can be criticised for not uncovering his "sexual deviancy".
The leaked report, which Exaro said was completed more than a year ago, should come with "a lot of health warnings", the BBC's media and arts correspondent David Sillito said.
But he said many of the quotes in Exaro's article matched "exactly" with what he had been told during his own investigations.
According to Exaro, the leaked draft:
Will Wyatt, a former BBC executive who left in the 1990s, said people would struggle to see how concerns could not have gone up the chain of command, but stressed: "I honestly never heard anything."
He said he mostly dealt with the factual and journalistic areas of the BBC, rather than the showbiz side, but did recognise it to be a deferential organisation.
"If you had said, around the time, that pop stars and DJs exploited their position, one would not be surprised. But the thought that it was happening with young kids is just beyond belief," he told Today.
But Rodney Collins, who was a press officer for the BBC in the 1970s said the corporation was aware of rumours about Savile "and young girls".
He said he was asked by the late Douglas Muggeridge, controller of Radio 1 and Radio 2, to investigate the possibility the claims would be printed in the newspapers.
"He said 'now I don't know what's true and what isn't true... I'd like you to go to the people you trust in Fleet Street and ask them have they heard any rumours about Savile, does anybody intend to publish anything and can you come back to me'," Mr Collins said.
