Chelsea will play Paris St-Germain, while Arsenal face Monaco in ties to be played in February and March.
Champions Real Madrid will face Schalke, with last season's beaten finalists Atletico Madrid taking on Bayer Leverkusen.
Bayern Munich play Shakhtar Donetsk, Juventus face Borussia Dortmund, while Basel are up against Porto.
Manchester City recorded a fine win over Roma in the final round of group games to progress.
But finishing second to Bayern Munich meant there was always a chance of meeting a top side like four-time European champions Barcelona.
In last season's first knockout round, the Catalans beat City 4-1 on aggregate, winning 2-0 at the Etihad and then 2-1 at the Nou Camp.
Chelsea, who finished ahead of Schalke in their group, are up against Paris St-Germain for the second consecutive year.
The Blues beat the French champions in dramatic circumstances in last year's quarter-finals.
There is added interest in that game as Chelsea sold defender David Luiz to PSG for a reported Â£40m in the summer.
Arsenal, who finished below Borussia Dortmund in their group, come up against Monaco, who were managed by Gunners boss Arsene Wenger from 1987 to 1994.
Monaco scored only four goals in their group but still finished top.
Arsenal club secretary David Miles said: "We've picked some of the biggest teams in Europe over the last few years, but we are not taking anything for granted. Monaco have earned the right to be at this stage."
Reacting to Manchester City's draw, director of football and former Barcelona player Txiki Begiristain told Sky Sports News: "Every tie in that draw is the same. It's fantastic, so we're looking forward to it.
"We have plenty of confidence with the way we qualified, beating Bayern Munich at home and Roma away."
Chelsea secretary David Barnard was happy at being drawn against PSG, adding: "It's a good draw logistically, too, for our supporters."
