The seven-year-old elephant, named Donna, whipped her favourite treat from the royal couple's hands at the official opening of the Bedfordshire attraction's new Â£2 million centre for elephant care on Tuesday 11 April.
The new facility will care for a full herd of nine Asian elephants, which are considered endangered due to habitat loss, poaching and human conflict.
