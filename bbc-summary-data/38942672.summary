Two-time major winner Jordan Spieth set the target on 10 under par with a 65 before play was suspended because of the weather.
He was later joined by Day and fellow American Derek Fathauer.
They are four clear of a group on six under, including US Ryder Cup golfer Patrick Reed.
The competition is being played on three courses - Spyglass Hill, Pebble Beach and Monterey Peninsula.
