[SN]TITLE[SN]
Umar Arif denies involvement in Wales' largest heroin haul

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A Cardiff man accused of involvement in Wales' largest heroin haul has denied £400 found in his car was drugs money.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Umar Arif, 29, is one of six defendants denying conspiracy to supply heroin.
Cardiff Crown Court heard police discovered the cash in Mr Arif's car after his brother Mohammed Sajjad arranged for him to meet Imtiaz Ali on a street at night to buy trainers.
Both Mr Sajjad and Mr Ali have pleaded guilty to the charge.
Mr Arif, a pizza delivery driver, told the court the money was to pay for car repairs.
He also said calls made to defendant Umar Butt were for repair work on family members' homes.
He told the court he was aware his brother Mr Sajjad had "previous convictions relating to the supply of drugs", but believed he was a "reformed person".
Heroin with a street value of nearly £5m was seized as part of Operation Frank between 2013 and 2014.
Shazia Ahmad and Wasim Ali, both from Newport, Umar Butt and Khalid Yassen, from Cardiff, and Zawed Malik, from Greater Manchester, also deny conspiracy to supply heroin.
The case continues.
