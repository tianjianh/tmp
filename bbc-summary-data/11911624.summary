Blue milk cartons return to Guernsey shops

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Guernsey blue milk, or low fat, cartons have returned to island shops and milk rounds after a shortage of supplies.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Retailers were unable to get hold of the product on Thursday afternoon, but packaging began again on Friday morning.
The low fat is the most popular type of milk, with it making up 70% of all milk sold.
Dairy manager Andrew Tabel blamed the installation of new technology for part of the problem.
He said milk sales had risen by 12% over the last few days with people panic buying because of the cold weather.
The supplies of raw milk were always lower at this time of year, he added.
