[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Turrialba volcano, some 50km (30 miles) east of San Jose, began rumbling and producing seismic activity on Wednesday night.
The authorities said they were evacuating nearby residents to temporary shelters as a precaution.
Eyewitnesses reported fiery explosions and ash falling like snow over parts of central Costa Rica.
This is Turrialba's largest eruption in more than a century.
The National Emergency Commission said volcanologists and other specialists were on site to assess the situation.
Costa Rica is home to dozens of volcanoes, but most of them are dormant.
