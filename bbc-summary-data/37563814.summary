Brad Friedel believes new boss Bob Bradley will bring a more "pragmatic" style of play to Swansea City.

The former USA international goalkeeper knows Bradley well and has warned fans they might be in for a culture shock.
Friedel expects Swansea to play a more direct style as Bradley looks to ensure Premier League survival.
"Bob's not a long-ball coach, but it will be more pragmatic.  I'm not saying it will not be pleasing on the eye, but it will be efficient," said Friedel.
"I mean that in a positive way, not in a negative way, but it will be a little bit different.
"It will be different from what it was with Brendan Rodgers and (Roberto) Martinez, so I hope the fans will be prepared for that.
"It will be a little bit more direct. When you used to play the Swansea teams when it was Martinez and Rodgers it was total possession."
Following the sacking of Francesco Guidolin, Swansea's new majority shareholders Jason Levien and Steve Kaplan surprised some by appointing Bradley the first American to manage in the Premier League.
The 58-year-old formerly managed the USA national side and enjoyed success at a string of MLS clubs and left French Ligue 2 side Le Harve to move to Wales.
Friedel, who enjoyed a long career in the Premier League with clubs including Liverpool, Aston Villa and Tottenham, admitted Bradley's appointment might be considered a gamble.
"I understand why some people will be questioning the move," Friedel told BBC Radio 5 Live.
"It's probably the biggest job any American has ever taken on with the exception of the national team manager.
"Is it a risk? I know Bob really well. He's a very diligent, a very bright man. He was at Princeton.
"There is a steel to Bob, but he will also be a good communicator with the players.  If he has to make a hard decision, he will have no problem making that."
