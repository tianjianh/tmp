[SN]TITLE[SN]
Exeter City 2-2 Blackpool

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Exeter City fought back from two goals down to salvage a point in a draw at home to Blackpool.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Exeter suffered a blow on five minutes when, after narrowly failing to connect with a Ryan Harley cross, Robbie Simpson landed awkwardly and was stretchered from the field of play in considerable pain.
Blackpool went in front on 19 minutes when Christy Pym spilled Brad Potts' shot and Colin Daniel tapped in the rebound.
The away side then went 2-0 in front on 39 minutes when a poor punch by Exeter goalkeeper Pym went straight to Potts, 15 yards out, and he lashed a first-time volley into the back of the net.
Exeter pulled a goal back on the stroke of half-time and it owed much to the great work and perseverance of Jack Stacey, who got down the right and crossed low for Ollie Watkins to ram the ball in from eight yards.
Exeter had plenty of the ball in the second half but found chances hard to come by until, in stoppage time, Reuben Reid stooped to head in Watkins' cross to grab a deserved equaliser for the Grecians.
