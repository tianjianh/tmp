Emergency services were called to Strathbrock homeless facility in West Main Street on Monday after concerns were raised.
Police Scotland said the 12-week-old baby had been taken to the Sick Kids Hospital in Edinburgh.
An investigation is under way to establish what happened.
Ch Insp Stevie Dolan, Police Scotland area commander for West Lothian, said: "This is a tragic incident that has affected everyone involved.
"Unfortunately, the baby remains in a serious condition and I can reassure the public that we are working closely with hospital staff as well as with the young child's family to establish the full set of circumstances."
A West Lothian Council spokesman said: "Emergency services attended a homeless facility for families in Broxburn on Monday, 30 May, after concern was raised over the health of a child.
"It is not appropriate to comment further at this time, as it is a police matter."
