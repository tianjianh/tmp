Emergency services and the Red Cross were called to the Penge Lane and Queen Adelaide Road area of Penge following the leak at 22:30 GMT on Saturday.
Gas distribution firm SGN said it had made a temporary repair overnight.
Residents moved to four reception centres were allowed to go home from 05:00 and engineers were working on a permanent repair, a spokesman said.
It said it aimed to complete the repair work by Sunday afternoon.
A member of the public reported smelling gas shortly after 22:30 on Saturday and called the national gas emergency number, SGN said.
It was initially thought more people had to leave their homes as a precaution but police later said about 150 people were affected.
Neighbourhood policing team @MPSBromley tweeted: "Huge Gas Leak Penge Lane / Queen Adelaide Road. Houses being evacuated. Please avoid this area."
A second tweet from the account at about 02:00 said: "Road closures remain in place in #Penge ... 4 reception centres housing evacuees. Community spirit pulling through. Updates to follow."
Sgt Lance Chenery tweeted: "On scene with @MPSBromley dealing with a serious gas leak in #Penge #SE20 large evacuation of residents."
Sgt Gareth Starr said some residents were moved from reception centres to hotels, with others escorted home by police officers from about 05:00.
A Metropolitan Police spokesman said road closures were put in place as a cordon was set up around the site. Gas engineers remain at the scene.
