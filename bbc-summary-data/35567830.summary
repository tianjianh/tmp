John Goddard put the Cards ahead inside the first 10 minutes when he tapped in from close range.
Bromley restored parity midway through the half when ex-Woking striker Moses Emmanuel equalised from the spot.
Cunnington pounced on a loose ball for the second, but both scorers were unable to capitalise on chances to extend the lead after the interval.
Woking boss Garry Hill told BBC Surrey:

"It was such a shame to lose Sam Smith with a groin injury because I felt at that time we were very comfortable in the game.
"It wasn't causing us too much of a problem. Bromley got some momentum and at the end of the first half, we were very relieved to be 2-1 down.
"We never used the elements as much as Bromley did and to be fair, they had breakaway chances and thanks to man of the match Jake Cole, it could've been worse."
