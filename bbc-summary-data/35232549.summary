[SN]TITLE[SN]
Isle of Man Attorney General Stephen Harding faces £89k legal bill

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Isle of Man's Attorney General has been ordered to pay costs of £89,000 after failing in his bid to prevent disciplinary proceedings against him.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Stephen Harding was suspended three years ago after allegations of perjury and committing acts against public justice were made against him.
After he was acquitted of all charges in 2014, he sought to stop disciplinary action being taken against him.
That bid has failed, however, and the Court in Douglas told him to pay costs.
Deemster Murray Rosen said: "The claim should not have been brought... it served no useful purpose."
Mr Harding remains suspended on an annual salary of about £160,000 a year.
A doctor's report, read in court in November, said that prolonged stress over the past four years had caused Mr Harding to become "severely depressed".
