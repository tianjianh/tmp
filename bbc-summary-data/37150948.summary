Swansea cannot 'go crazy' over set-piece issues, says Lukasz Fabianski

Swansea goalkeeper Lukasz Fabianski insists his teammates cannot 'go crazy' worrying about their set-piece frailties.

No Premier League side conceded more goals from dead balls last season than the Swans and they conceded another in Saturday's 2-0 defeat to Hull.
"We cannot go crazy about it because we can't be talking about set-pieces after every single game," he said.
"We can be lucky or unlucky, sometimes you have to credit the opposition."
He continued: "We need to make smart conclusions.
"We are hard on ourselves, we have to be smart. But I don't think we should panic or something.
"Sometimes it's purely about luck. Sometimes you have to say well done to the opposition for the set-piece because it worked well for them."

The former Arsenal goalkeeper says Swansea are working to address their issues with free-kicks and corners.
"We do work hard on them. We spend a lot of time in training on offensive and defensive set-pieces," he said.
"We just want to continue to work on it, continue to improve and to prepare, because we always analyse the opposition and how they operate on set-pieces.
"We're trying and hopefully it can work well for us."
The 31-year old believes Swansea's problems on Saturday came from a failure to turn pressure and possession into chances as much as their issues at the back.
"We looked very dangerous, we played well, it looked like we were in control of the game but we were just lacking a little bit of that finishing touch," he said.
"Sometimes we just needed a better pass around the box or a better cross."
