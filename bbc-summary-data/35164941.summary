Davies, 27, who will rejoin Scarlets for the 2016-17 season, missed the World Cup with a serious injury.
He made a try scoring comeback after seven months out in Clermont's European Champions Cup win over Exeter.
"There is a goal but at the moment I'm just concentrating on making sure I'm playing well for Clermont," he said.
"I'd love to get back in the Six Nations squad but it's down to me to make sure I keep working hard in training and perform consistently.
"First things first, I've got to get through a whole game - I only lasted 67 minutes on Saturday."
Wales begin their Six Nations campaign in Ireland on 7 February. Before the tournament starts, Clermont have six games, including three in the European Champions Cup.
Clermont's bonus-point win over Exeter Chiefs threw Pool Two wide open, with all four teams still in with a chance of qualification to the quarter-finals.
Ospreys are top with Clermont in second place ahead of their meeting at the Liberty Stadium in January.
Clermont, last season's beaten finalists, won 34-29 when the sides met in November.
With a game in hand over their rivals, Davies says the French team are in a good position and confident of progressing to the last eight.
"The group as it stands at the moment is quite evenly balanced," Davies told BBC Wales Sport.
"The Ospreys have done extremely well picking up those bonus points when they've come to France twice.
"They're playing some good rugby and ran us close when they came to Clermont.
"We know we've got a game in hand and we have every confidence we can qualify and move forward through the latter stages.
"It's going to be a tough ask but I do feel we've got plenty of quality in our squad to make a stamp on this European competition this year."
