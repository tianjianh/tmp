Works on £15m revamp of Swansea's Park Tawe begins

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A £15m redevelopment of a run-down retail park in the centre of Swansea has started.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The revamped Parc Tawe will have five more retail units, four new restaurants, a drive-through coffee shop and space for a food store.
Existing occupiers Toys "R" Us, Odeon, Mothercare and Staples will remain.
Hammerson won a battle against Swansea council in 2015 after it was blocked from approaching 80 well-known stores to move into Parc Tawe.
