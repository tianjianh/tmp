More than half of the sparkling wine produced in Wales and England will be clinked across the world at midnight.

Cases of home grown bubbles, which make up 66% of the total wine production, are shipped to more than 13 countries.
Sales are predicted to be close to Â£100m next year, the UK government says, with the number of vineyards growing.
Richard Morris, who owns the Anchor Hill vineyard in Monmouthshire, praised the weather in 2014.
"It was a brilliant summer, a good spring and autumn as well," he told BBC Radio Wales.
"The quality of the fruit was brilliant - so high yields and top quality."
He added home grown wines were starting to compete against their better-known rivals on a price and quality perspective.
