Marc Traylor, 42, of Hersden, near Canterbury, stabbed his 16-year-old daughter with two kitchen knives.
Jurors heard Mr Traylor, who had paranoid schizophrenia, had stopped taking his medication after being allowed to self-medicate.
He had denied the charge at Canterbury Crown Court.
During the trial, a firearms officer told the court Mr Traylor's daughter had been in "imminent danger" on the day of the attack on 9 February.
He told jurors he saw Mr Traylor stab the girl several times and she was screaming with the blows.
The officer said he realised her life was in danger and shot Mr Traylor three times.
Mr Traylor was shot once in the chest and twice in the head by officers.
Kent Police said Mr Traylor was incapacitated by the third shot.
One officer had already fired a Taser which missed and the officer who fired the bullets also fired his Taser first but it too missed, the court heard.
Both Mr Traylor and his daughter, who has since recovered, were taken to hospital after the attack.
He remains in hospital where he needs help to eat, drink and walk.
The court heard Mr Traylor had twice been detained under the Mental Health Act.
After the hearing, Det Ch Insp Nick Gossett said he hoped the verdict would bring "some closure to all parties involved".
He added: "Equally, Mr Traylor will be able to get the medical support that he needs at a secure hospital."
The Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC), which investigated the incident, said Kent Police's use of force, including the discharge of a hand gun and Tasers, was proportionate given the threat to life.
"Negotiations and risk assessments conducted by officers were appropriate," an IPCC spokesman added.
He said IPCC recommendations, which have been accepted by Kent Police, included the force should consider modifying Taser training to incorporate scenarios with third parties, complete work to draft and approve its policy on negotiations, and review training to ensure effective information sharing by front line and armed officers at incidents.
Following the court case, Mr Traylor's defence solicitor Sean Caulfield said the families of people with paranoid schizophrenia needed support and access to help, and those with the condition needed regular checks.
"Sadly, the Traylor family has suffered the life-changing consequences of a lapse in this care and Mr Traylor may now have to live in a supported unit for the rest of his life due to events of that night," he said.
He said Mr Traylor had the support of his family who understood he could not be held responsible for his actions.
Kent and Medway NHS and Social Care Partnership Trust said patients wished to have as fully independent lives as possible and part of their rehabilitation included self-administering medication.
In a statement, the NHS said it worked closely with patients to reach a point where this was possible and this included a thorough risk assessment process.
