Five Air France employees have been arrested following violent scenes at the company's headquarters in Roissy last week.

Workers were protesting against mass job cuts when two managers had their clothes ripped, with one being forced to flee over a fence. Several others were injured.
Reports suggest the five arrested staff were members of the CGT labour union.
They were identified by video footage, police said.
Hundreds of workers were protesting against plans to cut 2,900 jobs, increase pilots' working hours and reduce the size of the fleet, all designed to cut costs by â‚¬1.8bn ($2bn; Â£1.3bn) over two years.
Two managers in particular were targeted - human resources manager Xavier Broseta and senior official Pierre Plissonnier.
One union official said Mr Broseta had "narrowly escaped being lynched". Parent firm Air France-KLM said last week it would take legal action over the protesters' "aggregated violence".
