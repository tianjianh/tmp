Six men have been jailed for scamming pensioners out of thousands of pounds for "shoddy and non-existent work".

The Nottinghamshire-based gang conned 97 victims across the country out of more than Â£228,000.
Investigators said the scale of the fraud, which could be much higher, made it one of their biggest ever cases.
Ringleaders Tyrone Beard and Marcus Reading, both of Tuxford, were sentenced to six-and-a-half years and four-and-a-half years respectively.
Using names including Tileshield Coatings and Weatherproof and Nationwide Roof Coatings, they targeted bungalows telling owners they needed driveway improvements or roof coatings.
Their victims, all aged over 65, came from the East Midlands, Yorkshire, Norfolk and Cambridgeshire.
A two-year investigation led by the East Midlands Scambusters team found there could be 150 victims with the fraud amounting to Â£500,000.
The gang pleaded guilty at Nottingham Crown Court a week into their trial.
Mohammed Ditta from Bradford, who acted as a salesman, was sentenced to three years.
Simon Davies and Michael Sumner, both of Tuxford, Nottinghamshire, and Christopher Russell of Kirkby-in-Ashfield were jailed for 18 months each.
Councillor Glynn Gilfoyle, from Nottinghamshire County Council's community safety committee, said the scale of the fraud was "unprecedented and sickening".
"The victims were all vulnerable people who handed over considerable sums of money from their hard-earned savings for at best shoddy and at worst non-existent work," he said.
One of the victims, 76-year-old William McBroom, from Beverley, East Yorkshire paid more than Â£2,000 for moss to be removed from his roof and red insulation to be painted over it.
However, rainwater later washed off the paint and his roof leaked.
"I feel angry," he said. "If someone like myself who has all his wits about him can be conned like this, there are many, many vulnerable people wide open."
