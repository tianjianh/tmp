The singer, who was a member of 90s girl band Eternal, revealed the news on Steve Wright in the Afternoon.
She said that while she had danced in music videos and at stage school, Strictly would be different.
"I've done different types of dancing... but dancing in Eternal in Caterpillar boots isn't quite the tango," she said.
Redknapp also has experience of tap and ballet, having attended stage school until the age of 16.
"I've always loved the programme but I never thought I would do it. I don't quite know how I'm here... my husband is laughing at me."
The singer and presenter is married to former footballer Jamie Redknapp.
"Jamie has got zero rhythm, he's mortified! I'm hoping he'll be proud... I just don't want to embarrass myself or my family," she added.
Redknapp will join Melvin Odoom, Ed Balls, Will Young, Laura Whitmore and Ore Oduba on the dancefloor for the BBC One show, which starts next month.
Several more contestants are still to be announced.
Eternal became the first all-female group to sell more than one million copies of an album in the UK. Her solo success included 1996 album Naked.
Redknapp's TV presenting duties include co-presenting the BBC's Something For The Weekend.
She was also a judge on BBC One's talent show So You Think You Can Dance.
