A total of 64 snowdogs, each with a unique design, were created earlier this year and displayed on a public art trail across Tyne and Wear.
The trail closed last month and the sculptures have been sold at the Sage Gateshead.
The £259,200 raised will go to St Oswald's Hospice in Newcastle.
The highest price was paid for a dog known as Disco Dog, designed by mosaic artist Natalie Guy, which went for £9,200.
The first lot of the event, Arthur, was bought for £5,200.
Standing 1.5m tall (4ft 9ins), the colourful sculptures included several with North East-related designs, including two in the colours of Newcastle United and Sunderland football teams which made up the final lots.
Four smaller previously unseen pups were also sold off.
