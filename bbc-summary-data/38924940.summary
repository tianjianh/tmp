Out-of-favour striker Nicklas Bendtner remains part of Nottingham Forest's plans, says interim boss Gary Brazil.

The Dane was not part of the squad for the 2-1 win over Aston Villa, Forest's third victory in four under Brazil.
Britt Assombalonga and Zach Clough both started up front in that win, teenage striker Ben Brereton hit the winner and Ross McCormack is also now available.
"There was never a desire to offload Nicklas. He's very much part of the squad," Brazil told BBC Sport.
Former Arsenal forward Bendtner signed a two-year deal with the Reds in September but has only started seven Championship games, managing two goals in a total of 17 appearances.
"We are looking to involve Nicklas," Brazil added. "He is involved in training and is working hard.
"At the moment he is not getting a game, but there might come a point in the future where we really need him. I can only pick 18. I have a number of really good players who don't get changed on a matchday.
"You can't please everybody and you have to make decisions. At the moment the decisions are going well because we are getting results."
