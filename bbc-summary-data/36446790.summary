Rio 2016: Pollock's place in Irish marathon team ratified

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Ireland's Olympic Games governing body has formally ratified the men's marathon team with Paul Pollock included and Sergiu Ciobanu omitted.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Former Moldovan runner Ciobanu missed out on one of the three places even though he was third fastest of the Irish qualifiers for Rio.
Fourth fastest Pollock was chosen along with the two quickest qualifiers Kevin Seaward and Mick Clohisey.
Ciobanu appealed Athletics Ireland's decision but this was turned down.
The Moldovan native has the option of launching a further appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport in Lausanne while supporters of Ciobanu are also said to be ready to deliver a petition to the Irish Minister for Sport, the Olympic Council of Ireland and Athletics Ireland.
Pollock's impressive 14th place at the World Half Marathon in March, plus his 21st spot at the World Championship marathon in 2013 led to the Holywood runner's selection.
Arthur Lanigan O'Keefe was also ratified on Friday to compete for Ireland in the modern pentathlon.
