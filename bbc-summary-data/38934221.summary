IPCC probe 'after Staffordshire police stop man 17 times'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The police watchdog is investigating after a man said he was stopped in his vehicle and searched 17 times last year for no legitimate reason.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Adeel Rehman alleged the stop and searches by Staffordshire Police amounted to harassment and racial discrimination, the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) said.
It said it was told nothing was found and no action was taken by police.
The force said it made a voluntary referral to the IPCC.

Mr Rehman, of Normacot, Stoke-on-Trent, also complained that on one occasion officers used excessive force against him when he was stopped while driving.
The IPCC said its investigation would look at all allegations including the number of stop and searches and whether they were "reasonable, justified and in line with legislation, policies and procedures".
IPCC Commissioner Derrick Campbell said its inquiries were "obviously at a very early stage" and it would be carrying out "a thorough investigation of all the circumstances".
He said: "It is important for public confidence in policing and the complaints system that an independent investigation is undertaken."
In a statement, the force said it welcomed the independent investigation and would "co-operate fully with the IPCC as they undertake a comprehensive review of the matter".
It added: "We look forward to the publication of the report, once the thorough investigation has been concluded."
