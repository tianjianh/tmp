The avalanche happened at around midday local time (10:00 GMT) on the 4,000m-high (13,000ft) Dome de Neige des Ecrins mountain, according to reports.
Foreigners are among the dead but nationalities are yet to be revealed.
The Dome de Neige is said to be popular among climbers because of its relatively easy routes to the summit.
The avalanche hit three groups of climbers, officials told local media. Rescuers are still checking to determine there were any more victims.
Christian Flagella, a local police commander, said conditions were currently "winter-like" in the area.
