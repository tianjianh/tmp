New roles look at 'hidden' domestic violence on elderly

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A support worker has been appointed by Aberystwyth University to find out about domestic violence against the over 60s.

The worker will spend up to 18 months working with older people who are victims of abuse in the home.
According to the Dewis Choice project looking at the issue, more than 39,000 people over 60 suffer domestic abuse in Wales.
But it said cases often go unreported.
Sarah Wydall, from the project, said: "We know that we have an increasingly ageing population but the truth is that older people aren't newsworthy and don't get as much attention as the younger generation.
"They are often invisible to society and as a result, they don't always get the support they need."
A second worker will be appointed in Carmarthenshire in January.
A research team in Aberystwyth will use the real-life case histories developed by the project's support workers as the basis for a major report on elder abuse in Wales.
The report's findings and recommendations will be presented to the Welsh Government when the project ends in 2018.
