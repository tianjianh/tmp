[SN]TITLE[SN]
Opinions sought on air gun controls

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A Holyrood committee is seeking opinions on a new bill which would introduce tougher restrictions on air weapons in Scotland.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Air Weapons and Licensing (Scotland) Bill would require anyone who owns an airgun to have a licence.
The bill will also change the licensing of alcohol, taxis, lap dancing clubs and scrap metal dealerships.
MSPs on the Local Government and Regeneration Committee have launched a call for evidence.
Committee Convener Kevin Stewart said the committee was seeking the views of all of those with an interest in the bill.
Its call for evidence is open until 29 September. The committee will then begin to hear oral evidence later in the year.
Mr Stewart said: "We are aware there is considerable interest from both sides of the debate on the licensing of air weapons as well as the other aspects of this bill. We are seeking information and views to inform our work in scrutinising these proposals.
"This bill will affect every person in Scotland. It is a broad bill that seeks to amend the existing licensing arrangements in many areas, not least alcohol, taxis and private hire cars and public entertainment venues.
"Our committee wants to hear how these changes will improve lives. We also want to understand what these changes will mean in practice for you as an individual, or a business."
There are an estimated 500,000 air weapons in Scotland.
The new bill was introduced in May with a view to "strengthen and improve aspects of locally led alcohol and civic government licensing in order to preserve public order and safety, reduce crime, and to advance public health."
The proposals came after a long-running campaign by the Scottish government to crack down on the misuse of airguns.
It followed the death of two-year-old Andrew Morton, who was shot in the head with an airgun in Glasgow in 2005.
Under the bill, anyone wanting to own an air gun would need to demonstrate they had a legitimate reason for doing so.
These reasons may include pest control, sporting target shooting, or being a collector.
The committee said it was keen to get information on all aspects of the bill including:
Air Weapons
Taxi and Private Hire Vehicles
The Scottish government carried out a consultation on setting up a licensing system for air weapons in 2012.
An overwhelming majority - 87% - of those who responded to the consultation opposed the plan, with some describing it as "draconian" and "heavy-handed".
But the proposals were welcomed by police and victim groups.
