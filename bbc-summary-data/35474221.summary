Briton wins Apple Watch court case over cracked screen

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man who challenged technology giant Apple in court over a cracked screen on his new smartwatch has won the case.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Gareth Cross, from Aberystwyth, Ceredigion, found a crack in the screen of his Apple Watch Sport 10 days after buying the Â£339 device last year.
Apple responded to an initial complaint by saying the problem was not covered by the warranty.
Mr Cross then successfully took his case to a small claims court for breach of the Sale of Goods Act.
Apple must pay Mr Cross a total of Â£429 - the cost of the watch plus court fees - by 22 February.
The legal action lasted six months, and Mr Cross - who describes himself as a "Mac fanatic and all-round geek" on Twitter - told the BBC: "I couldn't understand why they would want to go to court over the issue, but ultimately I wanted [to] stand by my consumer rights," he said.
"The case did start to become a little stressful, especially toward the end with the prospect of having to attend court to defend my claim against what was the most valuable company in the world."
Mr Cross added that he had been "relieved" when the judge ruled Apple had breached the contract of sale by refusing to fix the watch.
"I plan to buy another Apple Watch, as for the 10 days I had it, I really liked it," said Mr Cross, "but I may wait until the next model is out."
Apple has been approached for comment.
