The pensioner was found by her son when he arrived to visit her in Townhill Road, Hamilton, on Sunday morning.
Police said she had been unable to get up from the floor or call for help after a man forced his way into her home and attacked her.
The assault happened at about 19:00 on Saturday. The man also stole cash.
The suspect was thought to be in his 50s or 60s and was wearing a dark, hooded top and trousers.
The woman was taken to Hairmyres Hospital in East Kilbride on Sunday where she is in a stable condition.
Officers are checking CCTV and speaking to local residents in the area.
Det Insp David Cockburn said: "Despite the significant inquiries carried out by our officers so far, the man responsible for this horrendous incident has not been caught.
"It is absolutely crucial that we speak to anyone who was in the surrounding area on Saturday evening who may have seen anything suspicious.
"No matter how minor you may think your information is, please let us be the judge of that as it could prove to be vital to our investigation."
A three-figure sum of money was taken from the house.
