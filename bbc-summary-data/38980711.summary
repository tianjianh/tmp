James Vince: Hampshire captain hopes pre-season work will lead to Test recall

Hampshire captain James Vince hopes the chance to pause and reflect on his game during the winter will show its benefits in the upcoming county season.

Vince, 25, hopes to reclaim a spot in the England Test side after losing his place at the end of last summer.
The right-hander, who also became a new father recently, feels a rest period before pre-season will help his cause.
"I've not had a chance to look and work on my game for a few years, I've just soldiered on," he told BBC Sport.
"It's great to take a break and look at certain areas. Come the summer, we'll see if those improvements have worked."
Vince scored just 212 runs at an average of 19.27 in his seven Tests against Sri Lanka and Pakistan in 2016 and made his last international appearance during England's limited-overs series in Bangladesh in October.
He was dropped for the series that followed in India in January and instead played three games for Sydney Thunder in Australia's Big Bash T20 league.
In March, he will captain the South side in the inaugural North v South series in UAE as he looks to force his way back into England's Test team under new captain Joe Root.
"I'm still at an age where if I have a good season, I've still got a chance to play for England for a couple of years," he told BBC Radio Solent.
"I want to get back in the side. Hopefully the work I've been doing now in pre-season is moving my game forward."
