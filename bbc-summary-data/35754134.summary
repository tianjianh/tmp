[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
News UK, which publishes The Sun, The Times and The Sunday Times, has rebranded its operations in Scotland.

The business will now be known as News Scotland.
The media group said News Scotland would have more autonomy to operate as its own entity, while "maintaining close ties" to the business's London headquarters.
The announcement comes as the company marks 30 years since it began printing newspapers north of the border.
News UK said its Scottish titles were performing strongly, with The Scottish Sun's readership standing at 544,000 and The Times Scotland at 56,000 daily readers.
The Sunday Times Scotland is said to reach 117,000 adults every Sunday.
News UK chief executive Rebekah Brooks said: "The launch of News Scotland comes at a time when our titles and digital offerings are excelling in the market.
"One in five adults in Scotland now read our papers - I'm extremely proud of this and have no doubt that we'll continue to be front and centre of the Scottish news agenda in this exciting new era."
News Scotland general manager Richard Bogie said: "This is the start of a new chapter for our Scottish business and products and underscores our great belief and confidence in our Scotland operations.
"Our digital audiences are growing at an unprecedented rate and our commercial business is thriving.
"We made huge inroads with our exceptional coverage during the Scottish referendum and general election and this rebrand signals a further commitment to delivering the best news, commentary and analysis for the issues unique to Scotland."
News UK started printing papers in Scotland at Kinning Park, Glasgow, 30 years ago. It has since relocated to Eurocentral business park next to the M8 in Lanarkshire.
