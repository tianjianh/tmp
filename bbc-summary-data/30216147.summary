Do new figures show Britain is becoming more homophobic?

Earlier this month a 24-year-old man had his jaw broken for promoting his LGBT rugby team in Manchester.

Hours before, in the same city, a gang attacked two gay men who were singing songs from the musical Wicked.
New figures show some of the UK's biggest police forces have recorded a rise in the number of violent homophobic crimes this year.
So is Britain really becoming more homophobic?
Crime statistics are used by the government, police and the media to help explain trends.
But sometimes the data is not so useful in telling us whether a particular crime is rising or falling.
For example, a Freedom of Information request submitted by the Press Association, has revealed that 19 police forces recorded more homophobic violent crimes between January and October 2014 than the whole of last year.
In London the number of those reported offences went up from 1,007 to 1,073.
A similar upward trend can be seen in Manchester, Northern Ireland, South Wales and Merseyside.
But could this actually be "good news"?
The crucial word in this particular set of figures is "recorded".
The figures show that in 19 police forces across the country the number of recorded violent homophobic crimes has gone up.
That's not to say that the overall number of violent homophobic crimes has risen.
But the number of people telling the police they've been violently attacked because of their sexuality has increased.
This may tell us something important about the confidence of victims in reporting offences.
"Whilst an increase in figures is always horrible to see, it is potentially because people are now feeling a little bit more comfortable in being able to come forward and talk to the police about these issues," said Richard Lane from gay rights group Stonewall.
There's been a concerted effort by police in recent years to set up specialist units to make it easier for victims to come forward.
This has particularly been the case with crimes such as rape, child abuse and homophobic attacks.
"So it is good to see police forces right across the country really making an effort to get the message out to the gay community, that they do want to hear from them and that they need to report these incidents," Lane said.
Although these figures may be a sign that people in same-sex relationships are less afraid to be open about it, Lane still feels more needs to be done.
"We still have people who don't think the police have believed them, or they've been keen to write it off as harmless banter," he said.
"People think now that we've got legal equality it's job done. Mission accomplished. But there's still a lot of work to be done."
James was the victim of a homophobic attack earlier this year.
"From the moment I saw [my attacker] I knew it was going to be something about my sexuality because he was making a big flamboyant performance about coming over to me.
"He shook me quite violently and threw me against a wall.
"I was very lucky, I could have ended up a lot worse [off]. It's frightening to think there are still people who are so angry about someone being who they are."
