[SN]TITLE[SN]
Braintree Town 2-0 Southport

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Sam Come's brace eased Braintree to victory over National League strugglers Southport.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Euan Murray almost opened the scoring in spectacular fashion for the visitors after 11 minutes, but his overhead kick hit a post after beating Ben McNamara.
Southport continued to play well, but it was the hosts who got the breakthrough when Come found the back of the net through a crowd of bodies four minutes before the interval.
He added a second just before the hour mark, blasting past Craig King after being put through by Michael Cheek, and that was enough to condemn Southport to a fourth straight defeat.
