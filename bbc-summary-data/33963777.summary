The British Gold Panning Association has won the rights to hold the event and will bring it to Moffat in 2017.
Thousands of competitors and visitors are expect to descend upon the town for the championships.
Richard Deighton, of the BGPA, said they were delighted to have seen off "worldwide competition" to win the rights to the "most prestigious event".
"We are confident that the event will have a positive impact on visitor numbers and tourism for Dumfries and Galloway before, during and long after the world championships take place," he said.
"We are thrilled with the support we have received in Moffat and feel it is the perfect showcase for gold panning."
Adam Anderson, of the Moffat and District Community Council, said the event, in August 2017, should be a "truly memorable week".
"Moffat is primarily a centre for tourism and this event will be a great boost to the local economy," he said.
"I am sure that the opportunity to host these championships will be welcomed by everyone in the town."
