"The timing of the first goal was a killer, the plan was to stay in the game," he told BBC Radio Wales Sport.
"It has absolutely killed us to concede.
"But I am proud of the side. They couldn't have given more.
"The spirit within our group, the heart and desire, we take a lot of positives from this run."
