Neil Warnock: Cardiff City 'need three or four additions'

Manager Neil Warnock says Cardiff City need to add "three or four good players" during the summer transfer window.

Cardiff have seven games of the Championship season left and are seemingly safe from relegation.
Warnock is already planning ahead and said he had learnt a lot about his squad in the 3-1 defeat at Wolves.
"I saw a lot more out of the game looking to next season than I have done for quite a few games," he said.
"It's reiterated certain things that I know that we need. We've got a decent squad. We need three or four good players to supplement that."
Warnock succeeded Paul Trollope in October 2016 and sought financial backing from the Bluebirds' board before committing to the club for another season.
The 68-year-old former Sheffield United and QPR boss has previously said he does not think it would take big money to launch a promotion bid in 2017-18.
"We haven't spent a penny yet because I didn't think it was wise in the January transfer window," Warnock added.
"I thought we really need to keep our powder dry and then go for it in the summer and that at the end of the season we can bring two or three in without hanging about.
"I think I'll be allowed to spend what I've asked them to. I think they want to me to do well."
Warnock felt his side were responsible for their own downfall as their three-game unbeaten run came to an end at Wolves.
Danny Batth opened the scoring for the hosts before Kenneth Zohore's ninth goal in nine games brought Cardiff level.
But Batth's second goal and a third from Helder Costa sealed victory for Paul Lambert's side at Molineux.
"We had some great opportunities," Warnock said.
"Every time we crossed the ball we looked dangerous but we couldn't finish on ours and Wolves took the chances that they did.
"People were not listening to who they should be marking and that's the cost."
