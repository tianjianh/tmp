Cardiff City have an opportunity to deliver "something special" to their fans according to manager Russell Slade.

The Bluebirds must win against Sheffield Wednesday at Hillsborough on Saturday to maintain their Championship play-off hopes.
"It's a huge game isn't it," said Slade.
"We still have a wonderful opportunity to deliver something special so it's a huge game for both football clubs."
Cardiff are one place and four points behind Wednesday and realistically have to win both their remaining games to claim sixth place given their inferior goal difference.
"It's never a straight road and [we're] almost at the finishing line and we've got ourselves in a position still where we can put ourselves in a realistic situation of getting to a play-off final and ultimately to the Premier League," added Slade.
"That's what we all chase in this division isn't it? Lots of teams below us would swap."
It took a last-minute penalty by Peter Whittingham to clinch a 2-1 win over Bolton, and Slade has warned his players may again need to be patient against the Owls.
He expects Wednesday to play positively even though a point will be enough to clinch their place in the play-offs.
"They won't play for a draw," said Slade.
"I think they'll play to their normal strengths and strategy that they have had over recent months and I think he'll pick the same team he's had over recent weeks.
"We have to be careful as well because the game is not going to be won and lost in the first 20 minutes. It's important you stay in the game - that's massive.
"You don't have to win it in minute one - just go about the strategy you know your jobs inside out. You know how important it is."
Wednesday manager Carlos Carvalhal claims there is no pressure on his team.
"Whatever happens we'll be in sixth position. That's a fact and it's a good fact," he said.
"We don't feel any pressure and we are not under pressure.
"We know it will be tough - but it will be tough for them too because we have a good team and good players.
"We will fight a lot, run a lot and battle for the three points."
