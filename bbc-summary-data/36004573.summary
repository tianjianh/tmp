Dan Holman also leaped to the top of the division's goalscoring charts with a first-half brace to take him to 28.
His first was a curled effort from the edge of the box after a good through ball by Asa Hall and then the striker slotted home a penalty from a handball.
Promotion was confirmed by Forest Green Rovers' loss at home to Woking.
A 22-match unbeaten league run through the winter did the damage for Gary Johnson's men.
Cheltenham return to League Two after just one season away and have won promotion with two games still to play.
Cheltenham Town boss Gary Johnson told BBC Radio Gloucestershire:

"It's a magnificent achievement by the club - everybody has played their part in the success, supporters, the players, the board of directors and my staff, and I am very proud of them all.
"(After last season) we had to change our thoughts, we had to change our attitude and we had to change our players and when we did that and when we got the right characters in, this is what happens.
"The chairman put us under a little bit of pressure by saying that we had to bounce back straight away, so we had to do everything we possibly could to do that on a small-ish budget."
