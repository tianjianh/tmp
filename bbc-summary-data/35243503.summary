[SN]TITLE[SN]

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A maths teacher who taught at one of the schools caught up in the so-called Trojan Horse affair has been found guilty of professional misconduct.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Wakass Haruf was accused of telling pupils at Birmingham's Golden Hillock Academy: "Islam is the true religion, not like those Christians and Jews".
A professional panel said while only part of the allegations against him had been proven, his comments had been delivered to large numbers of pupils.
The hearing has been adjourned.
The National College for Teaching and Leadership panel also heard Mr Haruf used words to the effect that adherence to other faiths showed ignorance.

The comments were said to have been made at a prayer meeting at the school in July 2013.
The hearing has been adjourned until February so Mr Haruf can prepare his mitigation.
Various panels have sat over the past few weeks looking at the conduct of some teachers at schools caught up in the Trojan Horse saga.
On Monday, Jahangir Akbar, former acting head teacher at Oldknow Academy in Birmingham, was banned from teaching indefinitely after the panel said his misconduct was of a serious nature.
He had been accused of trying to "eliminate" the celebration of Christmas in school and "undermining tolerance" of other beliefs.
The Trojan Horse affair was sparked when the contents of an anonymous letter, claiming hard-line Muslims were trying to get their own members on to governing bodies to try and oust head teachers at some schools in Birmingham, was made public.
As a result, five Birmingham schools including Golden Hillock were put into special measures by education watchdog Ofsted.
The school has since joined the Ark network of academies.
