Forecasters have said up to 30mm (1.1in) of rain could fall in south, mid and west Wales between Sunday night and Monday morning.
A yellow "be aware" warning has been issued from 21:00 BST and is in effect until midday.
Localised flooding is likely, potentially worsened by wind-blown debris from Saturday's strong gusts.
The warning covers Blaenau Gwent, Bridgend, Caerphilly, Cardiff, Carmarthenshire, Merthyr Tydfil, Monmouthshire, Neath Port Talbot, Newport, Powys, Rhondda Cynon Taff, Swansea, Torfaen and the Vale of Glamorgan.
