[SN]TITLE[SN]
Moray Council dredger to begin sea trials

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The only dredger in Scotland to be operated by a local authority is expected to begin sea trials later this week.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Â£2.4m vessel has been built for Moray Council to clean out harbours at Buckie, Burghead, Hopeman, Findochty, Portknockie and Cullen.
The local authority also plans to make the boat, called Selkie, available to hire.
Macduff Shipyard Ltd constructed the dredger at its yard in Buckie.
Designed to operate in small harbours, Selkie was built as a replacement for the Shearwater, a dredger Moray Council scrapped and sold two years ago after many years of service.
Selkies are supernatural seal-like creatures found in Scottish and Irish mythology.
