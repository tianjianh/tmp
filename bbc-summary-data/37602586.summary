Scottish private sector output 'returns to growth'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Output from Scotland's private sector has increased for the first time in three months, according to a report.

The Bank of Scotland recorded the fastest rate of expansion for 14 months, while firms also saw higher levels of new business and employment.
Its latest purchasing managers' index (PMI) rose to 51.2 in September, up from 49.1 in August. Any figure above 50 represents growth.
The increase came despite a rise in business costs, the report found.
The PMI measures month-on-month changes in combined manufacturing and services output.
In its report, the bank said the upturn in September was driven by the sharpest increase in new business intakes since August 2015.
Moreover, the rise in total output was broad-based as both manufacturers and service providers reported higher levels of business activity during the month.
Jobs growth continued in Scotland's private sector for the second consecutive month, but the rate of increase was only marginal. A number of panellists linked the rise in headcounts with efforts to support the expansion in output.
Nick Laird, from Bank of Scotland, said: "The improvement in the economy was equally shared between service providers and manufacturers, who both registered modest increases in output during the month.
"Demand for Scottish goods and services also rose, highlighted by a rise in new business.
"On another note, firms faced the fastest increase in input costs for 33 months, putting pressures on firms' margins as we approach the end of the year."
