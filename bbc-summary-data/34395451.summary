Aldeburgh Music has rigged up the phone box with a headset showing 360-degree footage of a performance inside its Snape Maltings Concert Hall in Suffolk.
Visitors can listen to the music and move the camera to offer different views of the stage and audience.
The video of Frank Bridge's The Sea is also available on YouTube.
Matt Jolly, digital manager at Aldeburgh Music, said: "We are trying out a number of ways that digital technology can help us make our venue and our work accessible to more people.
"We hope the Concert in a Phonebox and online video will give visitors to the site and viewers at home a fun and immersive introduction to Aldeburgh Music and Snape Maltings Concert Hall."
The phone box has been in its current position since 1990 when it was used to provide a hotline to venue's box office which was five miles away in the town of Aldeburgh
There was no box office at Snape Maltings on non-concert days, but that has since changed.
