[SN]TITLE[SN]
West Brom 0-3 Manchester City

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Yaya Toure inspired Manchester City to a dominant victory at West Brom as £49m summer signing Raheem Sterling made his debut for the visitors.

A Toure shot appeared to take a slight deflection off David Silva before going through defender Craig Dawson's legs and trickling over the line.
City extended their lead when Toure curled a shot into the top corner.
Vincent Kompany headed in a corner as City delivered an early statement of Premier League title intent.
West Brom had a rare chance for a consolation goal when Chris Brunt crossed for James Morrison, who headed straight at goalkeeper Joe Hart.
City host Chelsea on Sunday and the only negative for them was when Toure went off late on with an apparent groin injury.
Relive Manchester City's win against West Brom
All eyes were on Sterling after the 20-year-old England forward's controversial and protracted move to City from Liverpool this summer.
But it was Ivory Coast midfielder Toure and Spanish playmaker Silva who stole the show as they epitomised the desire and energy that manager Manuel Pellegrini's side were accused of sometimes lacking last season.
Silva's darting runs, jinking feet and vision allied with the power and finishing of Toure were too much for the Baggies to handle.
Kompany will also hope his struggles of last season are behind him after he put in the type of commanding performance he is more renowned for as he marked his display with a goal.
It is obviously too early to judge but he should have marked his Premier League debut for City with a goal.

The pink-booted Sterling, playing on the left flank, was clean through on goal just before half-time only to play his shot too close to keeper Boaz Myhill, who saved low to his left.
On the other side of the break, Sterling showed the kind of pace that puts fear into the opposition as he ran at the Baggies' goal before having an angled shot blocked away by Myhill.
"Raheem has given us the sharpness and speed to hurt teams," said Kompany. "It gives other sides things to think about. It gives us that bit of danger we need and we have so many tools to hurt teams now."
If West Brom's summer signing Rickie Lambert and fellow striker Saido Berahino needed motivating, then the signing of Salomon Rondon for a club record of about £12m prior to the match should have provided it.
However, the tactic of Baggies boss Tony Pulis to play both in attack backfired as the pair struggled to make any mark on City's defence, while the visitors dominated possession.

Lambert did go close with a dipping and curling 25-yard free-kick, while Berahino had a great chance when he ran on to a cross but he mistimed a first-time shot from six yards with only Hart to beat.
West Brom manager Tony Pulis said: "I told the players after the game I have to take responsibility for this one. I played Saido and Rickie and that left the midfield too open. It went against the principles I have always worked to and it has given me a rude awakening.
"I won't be doing that against the big teams. You have to make sure you fill the midfield and don't get outnumbered. I wanted to be positive but that has taught me a lesson."
Manchester City captain Vincent Kompany: "We have something to prove. Last season was below what we're used to doing. It was a good way to start the first game.
"We came out knowing we had a point to prove. If you'd seen the faces in training last week, I knew the team was going to be ready for this game."
Manchester City manager Manuel Pellegrini: "It's important to start with a win. In the Premier League normally you are going to win or lose the league by one point, so it's important to start strongly."
BBC Radio 5 live's Robbie Savage: "Manchester City were on a different planet against West Brom and better than any other team after the first weekend of the Premier League. West Brom were just beaten by a better team. Every player in a City shirt performed.
"I just think West Brom got it tactically wrong playing two in attack. Manager Tony Pulis said you can't lose a midfield battle with City, and his side have done that."
