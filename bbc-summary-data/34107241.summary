[SN]TITLE[SN]
Bont Fawr bridge flood relief work carried out in Dolgellau

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
About 1,500 tonnes of gravel is being removed from underneath a bridge in a Gwynedd town to reduce the risk of flooding.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Natural Resources Wales is clearing the build-up at Bond Fawr in Dolgellau, which is slowing the water flow underneath four of its seven arches.
During heavy rain, it could cause water to back up causing flooding.
The work is in addition to a Â£5.6m project to build new flood defences on the Wnion and Aran rivers in the town.
