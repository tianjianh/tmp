The image shows Wullie sitting on his bucket in front of his shed, with the first minister peering round the side after leaving him a present.
The original illustration will be auctioned for charity next year.
This year marks the 80th anniversary of Our Wullie and The Broons first appearing in the Sunday Post.
The card was created by Peter Davidson and Morris Heggie, who have produced the weekly cartoon strips for many years.
Ms Sturgeon said Oor Wullie was a "much-loved national treasure, adored by both children and adults across Scotland".
Proceeds from the sale of the original illustration will be shared between four charities: The Archie Foundation, SiMBA, Christine Witcutt Memorial Fund and The Dixon Community.
For the first time, special packs featuring the first minister's Christmas cards from previous years will be on sale in National Galleries of Scotland shops in Edinburgh.
