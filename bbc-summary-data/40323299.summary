Champions Trophy: How Twitter played the India-Pakistan final

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Pakistan thrashed defending champions India in the Champions Trophy to stun the country of 1.2 billion people on Sunday.

India started as the favourite both in TV newsrooms and on Twitter with anchors and people giving Pakistan absolutely no chance.
Take this tweet from a fan-page of former India cricketer Virender Sehwag.
But Pakistan had a different script in mind, which unfolded on Twitter like this:
Jaspreet Bumrah gets Fakhar Zaman early! But it's a no-ball.
Zaman show
The batsman took a moment to ponder over his bad shot to Bumrah's "shocker" and proceeded to hammer the Indian bowlers.
By now, Indians supporters were getting a bad feeling...
Pakistan set a target of 338 - but Indians were still confident.
