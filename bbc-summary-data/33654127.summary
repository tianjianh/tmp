Liam Lyburd, 19, also wrote that it was "beautiful" to think people were oblivious to the fact they were going to die that day at Newcastle College.
He has admitted possessing weapons, including pipe bombs, but denies intent to endanger life.
Newcastle Crown Court heard the note was recovered from his laptop.
Lyburd was arrested at home in November following a tip-off from a concerned member of the public.
A jury was told the embittered former Newcastle College student had built up a collection of weapons and explosives at his home near the city's St James's Park stadium.
The court heard analysis of his laptop found a file called "Newcastle College" which he attempted to delete.
But experts recovered the contents, including a note that said: "I'll see you in Newcastle College today. It's my first day back since 2012 the year in which my life became miserable after being kicked out for nothing.
"I'll get my power back today haha. I'm just looking forward to getting out of the house after spending three years in my bedroom alone."
He said he held the college "personally responsible for my miserable life, kicking me out for nothing and making me look a fool by not answering my message on Twitter and Facebook.
"You ruined my whole life, don't expect me to show any mercy today. No-one disrespects me and gets away with it. I will teach you a little lesson on respect with my 9mm hollow points ;).
"It's time for extreme civil disobedience. Fantasy will become reality for sure. Where the mind goes the body will follow and yes people will die there's no question about that.
"It's funny to think as I'm writing this the people that will die are walking around as if everything is normal, not knowing they're going to die today. It's a beautiful thought."
It was signed Felix Theodore Burns, a name he also used.
The laptop contained a clip from the film Tower Block, which showed a sniper shooting residents, police computer expert Paul Wells said.
The two-minute extract of blood-spattered victims falling as they were shot was played to the jury.
Mr Wells found Lyburd's Toshiba computer was used to access a Dark Web marketplace site called Evolution. The username Donald Trump was used, the court heard.
Payment for items, apparently Glock gun parts and ammunition, was made in the online currency Bitcoin.
The jury was also told Lyburd paid tribute on Facebook to Jaylen Fryberg, the American teenager who shot dead four classmates in Washington state before turning the gun on himself in October.
The entry read: "No-one listens to you when you say you are going to kill people, they only listen to you after you killed the people. No-one takes it seriously anymore.
"RIP Jaylen Fryberg."
The trial continues.
