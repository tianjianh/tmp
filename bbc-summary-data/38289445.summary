Hall, 23, scored his first goal of his second spell with The U's in a 1-1 draw against Oldham on Saturday.
He raced to thank the club's medical staff on the touchline as he celebrated the second-half equaliser.
"I wanted to thank them and the manager for all their help, it was a huge relief," he told BBC Radio Oxford.
After joining on a two-year deal from Bolton in July, Hall had to wait until last month to make his first appearance following cruciate ligament damage sustained on loan at MK Dons last season.
"There were days when I would come in and I wouldn't be able to do anything," the former West Ham trainee added.
"I wondered if I would ever play again. But, Andrew Proctor (Oxford United's head physio) put my mind to rest and made me feel so much better.
"I couldn't have wished for a better person to get me through it and it's a huge thank you to all the staff for what goes on behind closed doors and for what people don't see.
"It's just great to give something back to them."
