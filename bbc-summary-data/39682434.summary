[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Matias Vecino put the hosts head, before Ivan Perisic levelled and Icardi made it 2-1 at the break to Inter, who remain seventh - now only one point above their opponents.
Federico Bernardeschi had a penalty saved for Fiorentina but Davide Astori levelled and they led 5-2 through a further goal from Vecino and a Khouma Babacar double.
Icardi scored twice more in the last three minutes - becoming the first Inter player since Christian Vieri in 2001 to score a Serie A hat-trick away from home - but it was not enough.
