So she set up her own blog and YouTube channel, My Mind, My Funk, to share her experiences with others and tackle the taboo around mental health in Kenya - and beyond.
According to Matshidiso Moeti, the World Health Organization regional director for Africa, an estimated one out of every six people in Africa suffers from some form of mental disorder.
As part of the BBC's In The Mind series, Ms Wafula explains why giving a "human touch" to the coping with depression was so important.
