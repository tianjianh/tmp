Scans conducted after Saturday's quarter-final win over Italy showed a torn muscle for the 30-year-old, who has scored two goals in four games.
A German Football Association (DFB) statement said: "Another appearance for the striker is not an option."
Midfielders Sami Khedira and Bastian Schweinsteiger are doubtful for the semi-final on Thursday in Marseille.
Khedira has an adductor injury and Schweinsteiger a knee problem.
Coach Joachim Low, whose side will face France or Iceland in the last four, said: "It is very bitter to lose important players, especially at this crucial stage."
Gomez, who is the only recognised striker in Germany's squad, was substituted in the second half of Saturday's game, shortly after being involved in Mesut Ozil's 65th-minute goal.
"I am especially sorry for Mario. He has produced strong performances in the Euros and helped the team a lot, not only with his goals," added Low.
"For us it means that we have to accept a new situation and find solutions. And we will do so."
