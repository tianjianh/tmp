Spitfires and Hurricanes flew over London to honour the pilots and aircrew who took part in the World War Two battle.
Veterans and dignitaries watched as the RAF Regiment Band filed past Church House in Westminster.
More than 544 RAF personnel were killed during the 1940 campaign.
Prince Charles also attended a reception for veterans and their families.
Veterans gathered in the RAF Chapel at the Abbey and a wreath was laid on behalf of "The Few" - the term for the airmen, which comes from Sir Winston Churchill's phrase: "Never, in the field of human conflict, was so much owed by so many to so few."
Prince Charles, who is patron of the Battle of Britain Fighter Association, also laid a wreath on the memorial stone to Sir Winston, handed to him by the late prime minister's grandson Sir Nicholas Soames.

A range of events have already been staged over the past few months to mark the fighting, which raged between July and October 1940.
On Tuesday a service was held at St Paul's Cathedral on Battle of Britain Day - the name given to the day, on 15 September 1940, when the Luftwaffe launched its largest and most concentrated attack against London in the hope of drawing out the RAF.
A flypast of Spitfires, Hurricanes and Blenheims, from across the UK, US and Europe, took off from Goodwood Aerodrome. Present-day owners, operators, pilots and engineers were there alongside veterans.
