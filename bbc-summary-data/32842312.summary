Hugh Laurie challenges Hollywood's 'scary' view of future

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Jetpacks, sci-fi wizardry and magical pins - Disney's new film Tomorrowland: A World Beyond is taking us back to the future. As star Hugh Laurie explains, the fantasy movie is aiming to reignite our hope and optimism about the future.

Directed by Brad Bird, the man behind The Incredibles and Ratatouille, the film sees Laurie take on the role of David Nix - a scientist who has given up on the world.
"He has the element of a dictator about him," The House actor explains.
"Nix is impatient to the point of being contemptuous of mankind and its weaknesses. He feels that what the world really needs is an intelligent, rational approach to ordering society.
"He has the confidence and arrogance to think he is the man for the job."
Alongside Laurie, George Clooney plays disillusioned inventor Frank Walker, who discovered Tomorrowland as a boy in 1965 with his homemade jetpack.
Nix throws him out of the future realm - but, fast forward 20 years, and Walker reluctantly accepts the help of teenage science whizz Casey (Britt Robertson) and robot Athena (Raffey Cassidy) to return.
"Frank's idea was to create things that are fun, that make people's lives better because they bring pleasure and joy, and express hope," Laurie says.
"Whereas Frank sees Nix as a cold-hearted bureaucrat who merely looks for the most efficient way of doing something without ever taking account of the joy of discovery, adventure, and exploration."
"Beneath all of that there's a sneaking regard for each other because they are intellectual equals in a world that doesn't necessarily understand or welcome visionaries," Laurie adds.
"There is a kinship between the two. They are two versions of how a single person - a reflection of the decision that we can all make in life.
The choice, he says, is between optimistic creativity and a "more rational but colder, more clinical approach to life".
Tomorrowland was inspired by, and takes its name from, the futuristic area at Disney theme parks as well as Walt Disney's optimistic vision of a utopian future.
But, as Laurie explains, Hollywood's view of the future has darkened since Walt Disney opened the first Tomorrowland in the 1950s.
"There was a point in our film-making history when the future turned from being a place of hope and optimism to being a scary apocalyptic one," he says.
"The film allows us to really think about and understand why that has happened in our culture and where it comes from.
"If we approach it with dread, it will probably become dreadful. And if we approach it with hope and patience and kindness, then that's what we will get.
"The future is ours to shape."
Laurie says he was attracted to the role of Nix after being won over by the vision of Brad Bird and Lost screenwriter Damon Lindelof.
The actor recalls how he was "completely struck" by the first conversation he had with the pair about this "morbid defeatism that has gripped the world".
"I met them long before I read the script, and I had pretty much said 'Yes' before I left the room," he admits.
"Brad and Damon are two people that you follow - both extremely clever, funny, very persuasive and I fell under their spell before I even knew what was involved.
"They laid out this extraordinary vision of a future that ran completely counter to all popular ideas about how the world is going, and I was completely taken with it."
Despite conflict between Nix and Walker on screen, off camera, Laurie describes working with Clooney as a "complete delight".
"George is everything you expect him to be and a bit more. He is an absolute gentleman," Laurie says.
The actor adds that despite an apprehension among some actors about working with children, the energy and passion of the young cast members were inspiring, especially 12-year-old Cassidy.
"They were all absolutely great to work with. Raffi did a lot of growing up during the filming, which went on for a long time. She's proof that people can make a difference,"
"Cynicism and sarcasm are fashionable. Honesty, optimism and love are a little out of fashion. So it was nice to see this young girl supplying such positivity.
"There is a traditional, sour, old actor's view of working with children and they get a rough reputation in many ways.
"But they are, indeed, the future."
