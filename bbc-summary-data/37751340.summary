The scheme, which will cost an estimated Â£6m per year, will provide families with a box containing items including bedding and clothing.
It is inspired by a project that has been running in Finland since 1938.
The Scottish government said the scheme had a "proven track record" in tackling deprivation.
The competition, which was launched at Duncan of Jordanstone College of Art and Design and will be run by V&A Dundee, is open to design students across Scotland.
The winning design will be put into production from summer 2017.
A pilot project will be launched on New Year's Day in Orkney and Clackmannanshire.
Childcare and Early Years Minister Mark McDonald said: "There are over 50,000 babies born in Scotland each year so the winning design will receive fantastic exposure throughout the country.
"We want these boxes to become a key part of the lives of parents and children so the design needs to be bold and inspirational."
The competition will run until 17 November and the winning student will receive a Â£1,000 prize and mentoring from Scottish designers Holly Fulton and Scott Jarvie.
Mr Jarvie said: "Having studied in Scotland myself, the creative potential from Scottish colleges and universities is outstanding.
"I think it's a great opportunity for the students to create something that will have a real tangible impact on people's lives."
Sarah Saunders, director of learning and innovation at V&A Dundee, said: "We're looking beyond something that goes beyond surface pattern.
"We are looking for something the family can personalise themselves, can make it their own. We are looking for quite a lot of innovation in the design."
