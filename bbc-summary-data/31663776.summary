[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A new chief medical officer for Scotland has been appointed.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Dr Catherine Calderwood, a consultant obstetrician and gynaecologist, takes over the position from Sir Harry Burns, who stepped down last year.
Dr Calderwood recently held the role of acting deputy chief medical officer in the Scottish government.
She has a special interest in maternal medicine, obstetric scanning and high-risk pregnancy.
She has also held various high-profile national roles, including that of national clinical director for maternity and women's health in NHS England.
As chief medical officer, she will be the top adviser to ministers on a wide range of issues surrounding the health of the country.
Health Secretary Shona Robison said: "Catherine's appointment will build on her already substantial achievements and reputation in Scotland and the UK. I very much look forward to working with her."
Dr Calderwood, a graduate of Cambridge and Glasgow universities, will formally take up the post shortly.
"The role provides huge opportunities to drive forward and improve the health of our nation," she said.
"We have a health service to be proud of and the professionalism and standard of medical practice is second to none.
"Driving forward further improvements and ensuring we have a health service fit to meet the challenges of the future is a substantial challenge - but something both myself, and I am sure the whole of our health service, is more than ready for."
