[SN]TITLE[SN]
Teacher's body found beneath carpet underlay at family home

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The body of a school teacher was found covered by carpet underlay in a room of her village home, an inquest has heard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Bernice William, 50, from Lutton, Lincolnshire, was found on 9 April and later indentified by her DNA.
The find came two days after her husband, Lawrence William, was found dead in a stable block at the family home, near Spalding.
Police believe Mr William, 49, may have taken his own life, but are treating his wife's death as suspicious.

An inquest at Boston Coroners' Court was opened and adjourned while police investigations are completed.
Home Office post-mortems and toxicology tests have been ordered on both bodies.
Det Sgt Andy McWatt, of Lincolnshire Police, told the hearing the body of Mrs William - a teacher at a local school - was found after extensive searches by specialist teams at the house on Colley's Gate.
She was discovered two days after Mr William was found in a stable block at the property by the couple's eldest son, who was home from university at the time.
Her family believed she had been away staying with friends, but a missing person's appeal was launched after this was found not to be the case, police said.
A post-mortem proved inconclusive as to the cause of her death.
The inquest is due to resume at a later date.
