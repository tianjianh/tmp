[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
James Nolan, 32, is accused of stabbing Malcolm Ballantyne at his home in Glebe Place, Saltcoats, on 21 August 2015.
He is further accused of attempting to defeat the ends of justice and of theft and two drugs charges.
At the High Court in Glasgow, Mr Nolan's QC, Gordon Jackson, entered not guilty pleas on his behalf. Judge Lady Scott set a trial date in August.
Prosecutors alleged that Mr Ballantyne was repeatedly struck on the head and body with a knife or similar item.
It is further claimed that Mr Nolan did "effect blunt force trauma" to Mr Ballantyne "by means unknown".
He is also said to have failed to obtain medical help for the pensioner.
The charge that Mr Nolan attempted to defeat the ends of justice includes claims that he fled to Brighton in Sussex after the alleged murder and also disposed of a knife or similar implement.
