Federer, 34, a seven-time Wimbledon champion, looked to be heading out of the tournament after losing the opening two sets to the Croat on Centre Court.
However, Federer recovered to win 6-7 (4-7) 4-6 6-3 7-6 (11-9) 6-3.
"Marin is such a wonderful player and I was in so much trouble in the third set and in the fourth," the Swiss said.
"I played super great at the end so I am very, very, pleased. Marin is one of the nicest guys on the tour so I feel sorry for him but for me the dream continues."
Federer last won Wimbledon in 2012 and is aiming for a record eighth title.
He had not dropped a set in his first four matches but lost the opener on a tie-break against the ninth seed, who then broke Federer's serve early in the second.

The former world number one took the third set but had to save three match points before he won a thrilling fourth-set tie break and then the decider.
Federer admitted he was unsure that he could win after losing the opening two sets.
"You hope you do, but you don't know," he told BBC Sport. "I wasn't seeing his serves, he had one chance, took it and I was down 2-0. He was playing very well and reading my serve and I couldn't read his.
"It wasn't going well for me so I just tried to stay in the match, hope for his level to drop and get a bit lucky. That is what happened and the (tie) breaker was crazy.
"It's really encouraging to see I was improving and able to sustain a really high level. Mentally this will give me a hell of a boost and I'm really ecstatic to make it into the next round."
Federer will now play sixth seed Milos Raonic in the semi-finals on Friday after the Canadian beat American Sam Querrey 6-4 7-5 5-7 6-4.
"It will be very tough, but I've got the rest of today and tomorrow to recover," Federer added.
"He's had a wonderful year and is improving every day so I'm excited to be playing against him."
