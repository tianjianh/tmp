[SN]TITLE[SN]
Kettering General Hospital cancels operations

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Operations at a Northamptonshire hospital where services are under threat have been cancelled due to a "surge" in A&E cases.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Kettering General Hospital cancelled routine operations and some outpatients clinics on Friday for doctors and nurses to deal with over capacity.
The hospital said it would see patients who need emergency surgery.
In-patient paediatrics, obstetrics and accident and emergency services are all under threat at the hospital.
A review is proposing the services are offered at two hospitals covering Kettering, Luton, Northampton, Milton Keynes and Bedford.
Last month it emerged that "partnership" talks were taking place between Kettering General Hospital and Northampton General Hospital.
