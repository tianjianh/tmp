A 97-year-old World War Two veteran has had service medals stolen in a burglary while he was in hospital.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
William Fearn, from Hodge Hill, Birmingham, served in North Africa in 1940 before being deployed to Malta for two years.
He was decorated with the Africa Star, the Defence Medal, the 1939-1945 Star and the 1945 War Medal.
Police said the medals, taken between Thursday and Tuesday, were "worth a few pounds" to anyone trying to sell them.
But they were "priceless" to Mr Fearn and his family, the West Midlands force said.
PC Lee Parry said the thieves may have stolen the medals "thinking they were of high value".
Officers were checking CCTV and speaking to residents, local stores and second hand dealers.
