A caravan park on the East and North Yorkshire border has been evacuated due to flooding from the River Derwent.

About 12 people were warned to leave the Weir Caravan Park in Stamford Bridge by the site's owners who began knocking on caravans at 09:00 BST.
The Environment Agency (EA) issued a flood warning for the river at the park, in the early hours.
Two pumps are in use at the scene and the EA said river levels were dropping.
The riverside caravan site has about 100 static pitches and space for touring caravans.
The nearby Swordsman Inn was also flooded with a "couple of inches" of water, according to the manager, but this has been pumped out and the public house is being cleared up.
The Environment Agency (EA) said there had been a significant amount of rain in 24 hours, with up to 40mm falling in places and heavy rain showers are expected to continue on Sunday and next week.
