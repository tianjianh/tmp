Living with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Life is rarely a completely smooth journey and most of us will experience unpleasant or frightening events at some point.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Although distressing at the time, the intensity of the feelings usually fades quickly and we are able to continue with our lives as before.
If we are subject to or witness an exceptionally traumatic, the effects are likely to be longer lasting.
This is a normal response and can interfere with daily life.
The majority of people will gradually adjust to the experience, but for one in three people the effects will be longer lasting and more debilitating.
These people will develop symptoms of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD).
Psychological
Physical
Symptoms of PTSD usually start within six months, and sometimes only a few weeks after the trauma.
After the traumatic event you can feel grief-stricken, depressed, anxious, guilty and angry. In PTSD you may also:
PTSD can occur at any age, but if it happens during childhood it may affect how the child develops as a person.
They may feel guilty or ashamed or find it difficult to trust others.
Try to get back to your usual routine, talk about what happened to someone you trust and try relaxation exercises. Eat regularly, take exercise and spend time with family and friends.
It could help to go back to where the traumatic event happened, but make sure you feel ready for this. Take care with driving - you're more likely to have an accident .
Don't be hard on yourself or expect too much. PTSD symptoms aren't a sign of weakness, They're a normal reaction of normal people to terrifying experiences. Don't avoid other people, drink or smoke a lot, miss sleep or meals.
