Alan Wood, 50, was found dead in his home in Lound, near Bourne on 24 October 2009.
The Crimewatch programme on Monday is the second appeal on the murder and will also feature an interview with the victim's mother.
A Â£60,000 reward has been offered over Mr Wood's death.
He had been stabbed in the eye and throat and police believe his attackers could have tortured him for his bank card PIN numbers.
The credit cards were used in Stamford and Bourne in Lincolnshire over the next couple of days, but only a few hundred pounds were withdrawn, Lincolnshire Police said.
The programme will feature a reconstruction, along with the new CCTV images and the interview with Mr Wood's mother Maureen, a Crimewatch spokesman said.
Four men have been arrested in connection with Mr Wood's murder.
Three have been released from bail without further action while a fourth man, aged 20, remains on police bail.
