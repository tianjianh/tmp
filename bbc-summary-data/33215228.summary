A walker has died in a fall from a popular Lake District mountain route.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The  man, who was walking with his son, suffered head injuries in the fall from Striding Edge, Helvellyn, on Saturday.
Low cloud prevented an air ambulance from attending, but an RAF Sea King helicopter took paramedics and members of the Patterdale Mountain Rescue Team as close as it could.
Despite CPR being carried out by his son and other walkers, the man was pronounced dead at the scene.
Mike Blakey, from the mountain rescue team, said: "The man and his son were well equipped.
"Those people who were walking on the ridge at the time, and who risked their own safety to assist the man, should be commended.
"They did everything they could to help."
