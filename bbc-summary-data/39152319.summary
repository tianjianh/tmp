Wigan boss Warren Joyce could miss their vital match against relegation rivals Blackburn after minor surgery.

The club said the surgery on Tuesday was "a minor but important procedure which required immediate attention."
Graham Barrow and Andy Welsh will take charge if the ex-Manchester United Under-21 boss does not attend the game.
Joyce, 52, was appointed by Wigan in November after Gary Caldwell was sacked five months after guiding the club to the League One title.
