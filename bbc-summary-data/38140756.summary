India v England: Haseeb Hameed & Joe Root cannot prevent defeat as hosts take 2-0 lead

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
India completed an eight-wicket victory over England on the fourth day of the third Test in Mohali to go 2-0 up with two matches of the series to play.

From 78-4 overnight, England at least mustered 236 to set the home side a target of 103.
Joe Root hit 78 and Haseeb Hameed, batting with a broken hand, made 59 not out but will now leave the tour.
Parthiv Patel cracked an unbeaten 67 from 54 balls as India extended their undefeated run to 16 Tests.
The world number one side have also gone 17 home matches without being beaten and will wrap up a series victory if they avoid defeat in the fourth Test in Mumbai, which begins on 8 December.
For England, who have now lost four of their past six matches, some players will be allowed to leave India on holiday before the next Test.
"India gave England real hammering," said former England captain Michael Vaughan on Test Match Special.
"England need to look in the mirror and ask, 'why does it keep happening?' There is something not right in the mentality in the dressing room."
After an encouraging performance in the drawn first Test, England have now suffered back-to-back defeats that were largely based on substandard first-innings batting.
In the second Test, England were bowled out for 255 and here, with conditions again suited to run-scoring, the tourists failed to capitalise on winning the toss and only managed 283.
On each occasion, England surrendered a big lead, one they were unable to sufficiently claw back as India's spinners found success in the second innings.
The injury to Hameed will force one change to the side, but the poor form of Gary Ballance and Ben Duckett leaves the tourists with few options unless they make further call-ups.
"England were just not good enough on the first day - that's where it was lost," said Vaughan. "The pitch was perfect for batting. You've got to bat for 140 overs and score 400. 283 was about 150 to 175 below par."
India's spinners ran through the England top order on the third evening and got to work again on Tuesday morning, with Ravindra Jadeja pinning nightwatchman Gareth Batty lbw and Jos Buttler, who got off the mark with a six, caught at deep mid-wicket off Jayant Yadav.
Root remained, giving his team-mates a lesson in how to play the slow bowlers with patient defence, drives through the covers and fast feet to work through the leg side.
He added 45 with Hameed, who batted at number eight, before edging Jadeja to slip, while Woakes counter-punched until both he and Adil Rashid were bounced out by Mohammed Shami.
The arrival of James Anderson was the signal for Hameed to attack and a run-a-ball partnership of 41 only ended when England's number 11 was run out coming back for a second.
Woakes found extra bounce to have Murali Vijay caught at second slip in the second over of the chase, but England had no answer to Parthiv's sparkling strokeplay as India reached their target inside 21 overs.
Hameed is set leave the tour to have a plate inserted in the little finger of his left hand after being struck by Umesh Yadav in the first innings.
Though he was unable to grip the bat with that finger, the 19-year-old once again impressed with the composure and stout defence that have characterised his first three Tests.
Perhaps because of his injury, Hameed, who gave a sharp chance to wicketkeeper Parthiv on five, was initially even more shotless than usual - his first sign of aggression did not come until he played a slog-sweep to the 111th ball he faced.
However, when he was joined by last man Anderson, Hameed displayed his range of strokes, particularly through the leg side.
He brought up his second Test half-century with a six off Ravichandran Ashwin and the last 27 deliveries he faced brought 36 runs before he was left stranded by Anderson's departure.
England captain Alastair Cook: "To get bowled out for 280 in the first innings, we knew we were behind the eight ball. We had a little bit of a sniff at 200-6, but credit to their lower order.
"It's been a frustrating four days. Credit to India - they outplayed us. We've got a few days off to go our separate ways."
India captain Virat Kohli: "None of the pitches have been turners - we are just playing very good cricket. Getting them out for 280 was a great boost for us having lost the toss.
"It's been a complete effort. We're in a good space."
England coach Trevor Bayliss: "I thought we contributed to our own downfall. There were a few embarrassed faces in the changing room from the shots that were played.
"We were always playing catch up. When you're playing a team as good as India are in their back yard, you need to score well in that first innings and we failed to do so."
Despite a second successive heavy defeat, England moved up a place in the International Cricket Council's Test rankings.
Thanks to Pakistan's 2-0 series loss in New Zealand, Alastair Cook's side climbed from third to second, making the series in India a contest between the top two sides in the world.
However, England must win the final two Tests to stay in second place. If they lose them both they will drop to fifth.
