Southern Health NHS Foundation Trust came under fire following the death of Connor Sparrowhawk, who drowned in a bath at Slade House in Oxford.
Its boss Katrina Percy resigned last month after public pressure.
Previous interim chairman Tim Smart also stood down after he was criticised for creating a new job for Ms Percy.
Now Alan Yates, who is currently the trust's Improvement Director, has been appointed as his successor.
Anne Eden, executive regional managing director for the south at NHS Improvement, said he would lead a review into how the trust delivers services.
"The trust has some excellent staff working hard to improve services for patients," she said.
"We want to work with them, plus those who use the services and their families, to help design their future."
She added that Mr Yates has more than 35 years managerial experience within the NHS and has been chief executive of three different trusts.
The review is due to conclude early next year and a spokesperson said it could result in a "transformation" of the trust.
