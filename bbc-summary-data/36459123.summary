The body of Mr Stuart, 75, was found in Weybread, near Diss, on Friday night after he and Mrs Stuart - who has yet to be found - were reported missing.
Police have been granted extra time to question Steve Paxman, 61, from Leicester, who was arrested on Sunday.
Police have also named Ali Qazimaj, 42, from Essex as a suspect.

Mr Stuart died of "multiple stab wounds" and police are continuing to look for a "bladed weapon".
Detectives said they are still searching in Weybread for Mrs Stuart.
The force said Mr Paxman would remain in custody for further questioning, following a superintendent's decision to extend the time he could be detained.
Det Ch Supt Simon Parkes said: "Whilst our hopes for Sylvia's safety are reducing with the passage of time, there remains the possibility that she is still alive."
He said it was possible Mr Qazimaj, believed to be from one of the states that formerly made up Yugoslavia, had left the UK and police were therefore working with other forces in Britain and abroad.
He added that Mr Qazimaj should not be approached.
Suffolk Police said Mr Qazimaj's car was searched "in the hope of finding Sylvia".
"This remains a fast moving investigation and our priority continues to be to trace Sylvia," he said.
"With this in mind we are keen to speak to Ali Qazimaj.
"Officers are working to locate him and we would ask anyone with information about where he is to get in contact with police as a matter of urgency."
