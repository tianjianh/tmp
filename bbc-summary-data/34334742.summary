Plans to build a 21-storey tower on Worthing seafront have been rejected at a planning meeting attended by 200 people.

The tower would have provided 147 homes, with some being classed as affordable housing.
However, residents living in those would have entered through a different door to those in full-price flats.
The plans were rejected by five votes to one at Worthing Borough Council's planning committee meeting.
Speaking at the meeting, Councillor Edward Crouch described the tower, which was to be built on the Aquarena site, as a "lump of a building that looks like storage containers piled on one another".
And Conservative MP Tim Loughton said: "I'm afraid this just didn't come up to scratch.
"Local people saw through it and turned out in force to object to it and we've got the right result."
Conservative Luke Proudfoot was the only councillor to approve the application.
He said: "We do need housing desperately in Worthing - we're going to have to build 600 homes a year and I'm worried about where they are going to go.
"If we don't build high density on brown field land - which is what this is - then developers are going to start looking at green field sites."
