Colchester United midfielder Jack Curtis has signed a new one-year deal with the League Two-bound club.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 20-year-old former Tottenham academy player made his U's first-team debut when he came off the bench in November's FA Cup win over Wealdstone, but has yet to play a league game.
But he has been a regular in the club's Under-21 side.
Curtis follows Drey Wright, Alex Wynter and James Bransgrove in agreeing new deals with the Essex side.
