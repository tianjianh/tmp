Brian Alainu'uese: Glasgow Warriors lock banned for three weeks

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Glasgow Warriors' second-row forward Brian Alainu'uese has been suspended for three weeks for a dangerous tackle in last week's 35-28 win over Treviso.

A Pro12 hearing in Dublin said the 22-year-old New Zealander had breached the rule that a player "must not charge into a ruck or maul without the use of arms, or without grasping a player".
He was shown a red card for a similar offence in November against Ospreys.
Alainu'uese's ban leaves Warriors short of locks in their Champions Cup games.
With Greg Peterson, Tijuee Uanivi and Scott Cummings injured, Jonny Gray, Tim Swinson and Rob Harley - who is predominantly a flanker - are the only senior players available to Gregor Townsend for the pool matches against Munster on 14 January and Leicester Tigers the following week.
Alainu'uese joined Warriors in October from Waikato.
Warriors host Cardiff Blues in the Pro12 on Saturday.
