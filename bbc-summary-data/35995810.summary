The Manchester-based club cancelled the opening of their new Â£8m home because riders felt the track was unsafe.
A sell-out 5,000 crowd went home that night without seeing any action.
The Aces have since postponed their opening meet against Wolverhampton and this latest delay is because is of Friday's predicted weather forecast.
