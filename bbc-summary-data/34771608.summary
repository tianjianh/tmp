Tigers lost 19-6 to Exeter on Saturday, their first defeat after winning their opening three league matches.
But Cockerill told BBC Radio Leicester: "It's still a good start. We've played some tough sides in Wasps, Quins and Exeter, who will be in the top-six mix.
"There is a lot of rugby still to go. It will be a really intriguing season to see how squads pull through."
Tigers are next in action on Friday night when they play Stade Francais in the European Champions Cup at Welford Road.
Cockerill said a gruelling fixture list meant every team faces tough challenges.
"There is the Six Nations, and there will be injuries," Cockerill added. "Everybody is playing back to back.
"We have some good bodies to come back into the squad and Jean de Villiers and Brendon O'Connor are to arrive."
