New Zealand's Jason Taumalolo is set to play for the North Queensland Cowboys on Saturday despite being charged by police for throwing eggs at cars.

The 23-year-old forward, along with four other players aged 18 to 23, will appear in court on 11 October.
The Cowboys have an NRL play-off match against the Melbourne Storm and coach Paul Green played down the incident.
"Back when I was the same age, I probably would have been as much trouble as these boys," Green said.
"It's disappointing if it does turn out to be true. But in the whole scheme of things we are talking about an egging here and let's keep it in context."
Taumalolo, who has five caps for New Zealand, and the other four players, who are not part of the top-flight squad at the Cowboys, were stopped by police in Townsville on Wednesday night.
The club are said to be investigating the matter internally but no decision will be made until after the play-off game.
