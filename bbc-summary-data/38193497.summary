[SN]TITLE[SN]
Ipswich Town 1-1 Cardiff City

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Cardiff's Sol Bamba was involved in a confrontation with manager Neil Warnock after being sent off during their Championship draw at Ipswich.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Bamba was dismissed for his angry reaction to a tackle, and confronted the referee and fourth official.
Warnock attempted to restrain him as he approached the touchline and, after words were exchanged between the pair, Bamba pushed his manager's arm away.
Aron Gunnarsson gave Cardiff the lead, before Luke Varney equalised.
The draw did neither side any favours - the Welsh side remain in the bottom three and Ipswich slip to 17th.
Gunnarsson was the key for the visitors throughout the first half, hitting the post with a half-volley early on before testing Bialkowski with a driven shot from distance.
He eventually made the breakthrough seven minutes before half-time, pouncing when Bartosz Bialkowski dropped the ball from a corner.
But it was just seven minutes after the break when Varney scored for a second successive game at Portman Road, converting Adam Webster's pull-back from 12 yards.
After Bamba was sent off, following a tackle by Jonathan Douglas, it was Cardiff who had the best chance, only for Luke Chambers' superb block to deny Bruno Ecuele Manga.
Ipswich boss Mick McCarthy: "I am disappointed we didn't create more chances after the sending off. The game was going nowhere and the sending off probably affected us more than them.
"Cardiff then sat back and it was difficult to play through them. I think the fear of actually losing against 10 men can get into players' heads and Cardiff are no mugs, by any stretch of the imagination.
"I have seen players lose it, and I have lost it myself, but never on the fourth official.
"It probably was a foul but you can't condone what he did - he thoroughly deserved to be sent off."
