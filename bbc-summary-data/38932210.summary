Middlesbrough Institute of Modern Art (Mima) opened on 27 January 2007 since when it has hosted hundreds of artists.
The institution has more than 2,500 artworks in its collection including LS Lowry's 1959 painting The Old Town Hall and St Hilda's Church.
In 2009, then-Top Gear trio Richard Hammond, James May and Jeremy Clarkson staged a motor-related exhibition at Mima.
To celebrate its anniversary, Mima has launched a permanent Middlesbrough Collection featuring work chosen by the public.
