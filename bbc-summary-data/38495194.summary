The programme gets another nomination in the challenge show category, ahead of its move from BBC One to Channel 4.
Berry, 81, is up against by Strictly Come Dancing's departing head judge Len Goodman in the TV judge category.
Mel and Sue face competition for the TV presenter award from Ant and Dec, who have won the accolade 15 years running.
The pair will not be following Bake Off to its new home, with Berry also opting to leave the show.
Out of the original line-up, only Paul Hollywood will also move to Channel 4.
A new award for period drama pits BBC shows Call the Midwife, Peaky Blinders and Poldark against ITV's Victoria and Netflix's Stranger Things.
The nomination for the Netflix's '80s-based drama marks the first NTA citation for a drama series broadcast on a streaming service.
Members of the public have until noon on 25 January to vote for their favourites in the 15 award categories.
ITV will broadcast the awards live from London's O2 Arena on 25 January.
