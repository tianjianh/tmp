The 26-year-old took 25 wickets and scored more than 300 runs to help the Red Rose club lift the trophy in 2015.
In August, Faulkner became only the sixth Australian to take a hat-trick in a one-day international when he achieved the feat against Sri Lanka.
"He's a world-class cricketer, a true competitor. It'll be great to have him back," head coach Ashley Giles said.
Faulkner, from Tasmania, has played one Test, 59 one-day internationals and 21 Twenty20 matches for Australia.
"Finals Day at Edgbaston was one of the best days of my career so hopefully we can replicate the success of 2015 next year," Faulkner said.
"I was blown away by the support I received from the Lancashire fans."
