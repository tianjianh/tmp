A controlled explosion was carried out on the object, found close to the Strule Arts Centre on Saturday morning.
Businesses were evacuated, streets were closed and the public were advised to avoid the town centre during the alert.
Police said they regretted the disruption but warned about leaving "unattended items" in public places.
Chief Insp Graham Dodds said: "I understand that incidents such as this are very disruptive for those in the town and I would like to pay tribute to all who worked with my officers this morning to ensure disruption was minimal.
"We greatly appreciate the support and co-operation from the local businesses and people in the community and regret any inconvenience caused.
"Public safety is of paramount importance to us and we are all too aware of the current threat level and must take cognisance of this in our approach to such incidents to ensure everyone is kept safe.
"As such I would want to take this opportunity to remind members of the public of the dangers of leaving unattended items in public places."
Last week, Strule Arts Centre was the focus of another bomb alert as it hosted a PSNI recruitment event.
Nothing was found during subsequent police searches and last Saturday's recruitment event proceeded as planned.
