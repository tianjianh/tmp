A Scottish ultra-runner has broken an endurance record by running and climbing 24 summits in 24 hours.

Donnie Campbell, 32, a personal trainer from Edinburgh, completed Ramsay's Round in 23 hours six minutes.
He is the second person to finish the 56-mile (90km) challenge, which includes a total ascent of 28,000ft (8,500m) in less than a day in winter conditions.
Mr Campbell said it was "by far one of the toughest things" he had ever done.
He beat previous record holder Jon Gay, who completed Ramsay's Round in 2013, by 12 minutes.
Speaking to BBC Scotland's news website, he said Saturday's challenge was "brutal".
He added: I collapsed on my face on the finish line after running down Ben Nevis.
"I was always 100% confident that I'd complete the round, I just wanted to get under the 24 hours."
Ramsay's Round is made up of 23 Munros, which are mountains over 3,000ft (914m), and one smaller summit.
It was first completed in July 1978 by Charles Ramsay, in a time of 23 hours 58 minutes - a record which was unbeaten for the next nine years.
The circuit begins at Glen Nevis Youth Hostel and ends in the same location after the final summit, Ben Nevis.
Mr Campbell has taken part in several endurance challenges since he began ultra-running in 2009, including crossing the Namib desert, and running from Glasgow to Skye.
But the former Marine said Ramsay's Round stood out as the most difficult task to date.
"The real challenge is unfavourable weather conditions. I ran in 12 hours of darkness, cold and snow," he said.
"I could hardly stand on the steepest hills. It was frozen on top and my shoes weren't gripping, but it could've been worse; I could have had knee-deep snow."
Mr Campbell made up time from his uphill hikes by running down the other side of the Munros.
"I was really enjoying the first part - running through the dark by myself. It was like being a kid playing in the mountains.
"I was looking at the challenge in three parts which made it a bit more manageable, but by mid-morning on Saturday I was starting to feel nauseous."
He kept himself going on the day-long hike by eating jelly sweets, flapjacks and a bowl of tomato soup.
"I was really struggling for energy, and dry heaving, but doing my best to stay positive.
"I didn't have much fuel in the tank, and for the last six hours I was completely running on empty.
"That's where the old Marine mentality kicked in. I just had to put my head down and get on with it."
Mr Campbell said: "I didn't know if it was possible to break the record until Munro number 20.
"I knew if I kept the pace up then I could beat it, but it'd be close.
"One of our head torches packed in towards the end and I had to use mine to shine a light for my support runner.
"It became a problem when we were sprinting down Ben Nevis to beat the record - I had to leave him to ensure I got the record.
"I couldn't have done it without my support team - they were a big part of the challenge.
"My wife, her mum and my parents were feeding me, and I had two support runners with me too."
Ramsay's Round is more commonly run in summer, with 94 participants completing it in under 24 hours without the additional challenge of winter conditions.
The winter season runs from 1 December until the end of February each year.
Mr Campbell is now looking forward to relaxing over Christmas, before finding new ultra-running challenges to take on under new sponsorship in 2017.
