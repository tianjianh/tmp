[SN]TITLE[SN]
Is it cheaper to rent in Europe?

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Liberal Democrats say they'd let young working people, living with their parents, claim a low-interest government loan to move out and rent their own home.

Under the 'Help to Rent' scheme, young working people in England would be able to borrow up to £1,500 (£2,000 in London) from the Government towards their tenancy deposit.
Renting in the UK can be expensive - very in parts of some cities. But do people living in Europe to get a better deal?
See what other political parties are saying about housing.
"I rent in Bremen and the area I live is quiet, spacious and leafy
"I'd say people pay around £600 for a one bedroom flat and £850 for a two bed and that includes bills and you have no council tax on top of what you've already paid in income tax.
"I think rent is cheaper here because there is healthier competition and regulation in the market and stronger union representation for renters.
"Around half of Germany rents and there isn't this UK obsession with getting on the property ladder.
"I think I get value for money. However coming from renting in the UK where it can be so difficult, I am more easily impressed."
"In Paris a one bedroom flat starts at £550, a double starts at £750 in Paris.
"Then it depends, as always, on the location and the size of the flat; I live in a good area called Villiers and I pay £650 for one bedroom and that is seen as a good deal.
"Flat sizes in Paris are small and the the main difference with London I would say, is that people don't share flats in the same way.
"I definitely think I get good value, especially for Paris. French flats have character. The owner has to pay for all the maintenance, so most of the time the quality of the flat is good .
"Paris is cheaper than London but it is a real issue to get a flat because of the French law which is very protective of the leaseholder.
"Owners are always very demanding for more - guarantees, securities, deposits - and as a consequence it is always a battle to find a flat to rent because there are always at least 40 people with deposits competing for each flat."
"I lived in San Sebastian until last year and have just moved out to a smaller town nearby.
"I lived in the old town which is one of the most expensive areas. Now I live outside the city and I pay half what I used to.
"The flats in town range from £350 to well over £900 and the flats are never that big.  Rents may appear cheaper than the UK, but when the average wage is £850 they don't seem so cheap and that's if you're working.
"San Sebastian is a hard place to find flats, because renting isn't really as popular as it is in the UK. I found my flat through the school I worked for.
"My standard of living is great and while I live in a small flat I spend more time outside, at the beach, in the mountains and cooking fresh food."
"The prices vary a lot but it's normal to pay around £620 - £780 for a one bedroom flat and £930 for a two bedroom
"The prices are not as expensive in Copenhagen as London but are rising fast. This is due to very few flats being available compared to a huge demand.
"There was a big renovation in Copenhagen in the 90s and many smaller flats were turned into bigger flats.
"This is one of the reasons why there are less apartments. The other reason is that lots of people move to Copenhagen.
"It's also worth noting that  people are relying more on pensions in Denmark and not speculating on houses in the same way as they do in London."
"Rents are not at market prices, the politicians control price levels so a nice flat in a nice area can rent for very little... but those who have a good contract never let it go.
"This means we have a large second hand market with very high prices and a big illegal black market, where contracts are bought and sold and nobody knows how much money is involved in that.
"There is big lack of flats, especially for rental, so the prices are high. It's very hard to find a rental contract, it takes years and years and years in a queue.
"I've been waiting for ten years and still nothing nice and affordable has come my way.
"The standard of living is very high compared to most countries - three-ply windows, internal plumbing, broadband access has been standard for decades.
"However, the last flat I lived in was filthy and worn down. There was lots of crime and vandalism in the area and there were loads of young gangster wannabes harassing people and dealing drugs."
