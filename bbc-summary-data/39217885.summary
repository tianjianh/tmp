A shed turned into a mobile nightclub has officially been recognised as the world's smallest by Guinness World Records.

Club 28 has capacity for three people - or six "at a squeeze" - and a DJ.
Measuring 2.01m (6.5ft) high and 0.92m (3ft) wide, it features a sound system, two turntables, a dance floor, and disco lighting.
Gerard Jenkins-Omar and Stephen Robson debuted their creation at Rotherham Carnival and charged 50p admission.
They said they wanted to create something small, fun and intimate for partygoers.

Mr Jenkins-Omar, a former Ibiza DJ, said: "It was originally a shed we found in Hillsborough - we got a joiner to build the top up, put a door on, and put in a DJ booth and dance floor.
"It comfortably fits three, and that's big people, and has a maximum capacity of six, at a squeeze," he said.
In order to achieve the record, the club had to be open to the general public and charge an entrance fee.
A strict one-in-one-out policy was in place to prevent overcrowding.
Mr Jenkins-Omar said: "My mum has bought me a Guinness World Records book every year since I was a kid, and still does now, even though I am 31."
He is now planning to tour the UK with the mobile club.
The previous record was set by a disco called Rumours in 2010, which appeared at the Bold Street Festival, in Liverpool.
