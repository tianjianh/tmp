Robbie Williams made a surprise appearance at an auction selling some of his memorabilia for charity.

The singer took control of the gavel as 150 items, including handwritten lyrics and bespoke suits, went under the hammer for a Staffordshire hospice.
The sale raised £120,000, with a highest bid of £25,000 for handwritten lyrics to the 2013 track Go Gentle.
Williams is a patron of the Donna Louise children's hospice in his home town of Stoke-on-Trent.
The star chatted and joked with the audience, which included his wife Ayda Field and father Pete Conway.
When he sold a set of handwritten lyrics to Kids - his duet with Kylie Minogue - for £5,500, Williams told the auction room: "It's the popular song from last century.... Kylie Minogue is very fit and still is."
When asked if it was his first time as an auctioneer, Williams said: "I think so, but my memory is shocking."
The singer appeared to become distracted when fan Barbara Veras, 26, a doctor from Sao Paulo in Brazil, entered a bid.
He told her: "Haven't I kissed you during a gig?
"Are you Barbara, is your name Barbara? Nice to see you again, you normally wear really red lipstick and are at the front of the shows.
"It's nice to meet you, glad we've had a chat now because we kissed first and now we're chatting."
