Notts County have cancelled their end-of-season awards night after their women's team folded.

Notts County Ladies were put into liquidation on Friday, two days before their first match of the Women's Super League Spring Series against Arsenal.
"It's been a very difficult week for everyone connected with Notts County players, staff and fans," chairman and owner Alan Hardy said.
"I don't think it's right that we go ahead with an event of this nature."
The club's awards will now be presented at Saturday's men's home game with Blackpool.
County ladies' players were told the WSL 1 club would be wound-up just 15 minutes before the announcement was made to the public.
Local businessman Hardy purchased Notts County's men's and women's clubs in December, aiming to clear debts owed to HM Revenue and Customs by both outfits.
In a statement the club said Hardy had "reluctantly admitted defeat in his bid to save Notts County Ladies Football Club after facing a near-Â£1m bill to keep the club afloat this season".
Previously known as Lincoln Ladies before relocating in 2014, the Notts squad included England's Carly Telford, Laura Bassett, Jade Moore and Jo Potter.
They finished sixth in WSL 1 in 2016 after reaching the 2015 FA Cup final.
