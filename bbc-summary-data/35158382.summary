One man tricked the 93-year-old victim into turning around while another swapped his card for a fake one at the Natwest branch in Grantham.
They also stole the man's PIN, and later used his bank details to transfer the money from his account.
Natwest said it was working with police to identify the three "callous" thieves seen in CCTV footage from the bank.
Detectives said the men were "organised in their deception and very selective about their victim."
A spokesperson for NatWest said: "Our customer fell victim to a callous distraction technique whilst using an ATM.
"We have refunded all the money to the customer and continue to do everything we can to help the police identify the criminals."
