A wheelchair racer is aiming to set a world record for a London to Paris triathlon.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Jen Warren, from Rugby in Warwickshire, lost the use of her left leg in a skiing accident in 2008.
The former Army medical officer is part of all-woman team Enable, racing in the Arch to Arc triathlon from Marble Arch to the Arc de Triomphe.
The group is hoping to become the first disability team to complete the gruelling challenge.
Mrs Warren is one of 24 injured military personnel who are raising money for Help For Heroes.
The relay team has completed the 87 miles from Marble Arch in central London to the Dover coast.
They reached the coast just in time for their swimming tidal window to cross the English Channel to the French coast.
Next they face a 181 mile race from Calais to the Arc de Triomphe in Paris.
Mrs Warren was introduced to Coventry Godiva Harriers Wheelchair Academy to aid her recovery.
Grant funding from the charity has enabled the 34-year-old to buy a specialist racing wheelchair and a hand-bike to support her progression with the sport.
She said: "This is about showing people that your only limit is your imagination and what you can do.
She added: "It is you, the chair, the road and it is up to you how far you push it. But the triathlon bug has bitten me bad."
Mrs Warren has taken part in the Help for Heroes Big Battlefield Bike Ride on a tandem with her husband, the Lewa Marathon, the Great North Run, ParaTri and the Bolton Ironman.
