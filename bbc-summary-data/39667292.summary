A woman has broken the world marathon record for the "fastest witch" - a year after being disqualified because her skirt was too short.

Nicola Nuttall, 47, from Pendle, Lancashire, was stripped of her record by Guinness World Records officials despite smashing the mark by 29 minutes.
Undeterred, she hopped on to her broom again in London with a longer skirt.
She finished with a time of 03:26:13 - five minutes quicker than last year.
Record officials measured her skirt and broom at the start and finish as she bid to break the four-hour time limit for the record.
Guinness World Records tweeted: "No broomstick required! Nicola Nuttall, Fastest marathon dressed as a witch (female) - 3:26:13."
The runner told the BBC before the race: "I'm doing it for the second time as the first time they didn't like the length of my skirt.
"So they rejected my evidence.
"But I'm not that easily put off so I'm going to do it again - they can't get rid of me that easily."
She added: "The dress is quite comfortable but the broom is quite long so it's not the easiest and it can get a bit congested at the start.
"But the hat is quite wind-dependent so I might need to keep a good hold of it."
Mrs Nuttall, who lives in Barrowford in the district of Pendle, said she was inspired by the area's infamous 1612 witchcraft trials when 10 people were hanged.
A spokeswoman for Guinness World Records said: "Our marathon costume records are designed to propose an additional challenge to the marathon run.
"In this case in particular, the length of the skirt poses the inhibitive factor in accordance with our guidelines."
A total of 73 world records were attempted at this year's event, including the fastest marathon dressed as a nun, Grim Reaper, Mr Potato Head and for a runner dribbling two basketballs.
