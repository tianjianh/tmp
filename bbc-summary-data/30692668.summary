The luxury car maker sold 4,063 cars, up 12% on last year, and marking the fifth consecutive year of record sales.
Sales in the US increased by almost a third, by 40% in Europe and in the Middle East by 20%, the firm said.
Its Wraith model and strong orders for its new Ghost Series II helped drive the strong performance.
The firm said it sold more cars worth more than â‚¬200,000 (Â£157,000) than any of its rivals, with demand for bespoke customisation remaining high.
"A record number of customers spent personal one-on-one time with Rolls-Royce's Bespoke design consultants commissioning their personalised vehicles," it said.
Chief executive Torsten Muller-Otvos told the BBC's Today programme that about 80% of its buyers were entrepreneurs and business owners, with the remainder celebrities.
He said the firm's strong performance was helped by its emphasis on ensuring a "balanced global sales picture", meaning overall demand remained strong.
He also said the firm was "mulling" creating a four-wheel drive SUV vehicle.
The company, which is owned by Germany's BMW and based in West Sussex, said it had created 200 new permanent jobs over the past 18 months to meet the strong demand, employing more than 1,500 people.
