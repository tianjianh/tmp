[SN]TITLE[SN]
Six care home staff in Idle cleared of neglect

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Six care home staff accused of wilfully neglecting an elderly resident have been cleared by a judge.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Three men and three women had been on trial at Bradford Crown Court along with two other defendants.
It was claimed Edward Hinnells, 79, was kept in "abject squalor" at Highdell Nursing Home, in Idle, Bradford.
However, Judge Colin Burn told the jury to return not guilty verdicts against the six people, saying there were "very good legal reasons".
Senior care worker Jennifer Cross, 60, from Idle, carer Nicki Kassama, 30, from Shipley, senior carer Valerie James, 58, from Eccleshill, nurses Desmond Crowley, 59, from Daisy Hill, Bradford, and Gerard McDermott, 58, from Ilkley, and 49-year-old cleaner Piotr Czajkowski, from Ravenscliffe, were cleared of any wrongdoing.
Judge Burn said he was unable to elaborate on his reasoning at this stage.
The trial continues against care home manager Stephen Pelkowski, 51, from Addingham, and senior nurse Phillippa Robinson, 57, from Shipley.
Prosecutors allege Mr Hinnells was left to live in a room "not fit for human habitation" without bedding, toilet paper or wipes after he became a resident at the home in February 2013.
Mr Pelkowski and Mrs Robinson deny the charge.
