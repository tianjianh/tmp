Shiny happy people: Northern Ireland tops UK happiness index again

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Official statistics have again ranked Northern Ireland as the most contented region of the UK.

The data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) suggests people in Northern Ireland are happier and more satisfied with life compared to any other UK region.
That has been a consistent pattern since the ONS began life satisfaction surveys in 2011.
But why is Northern Ireland happier?
At first glance it seems counter-intuitive - Northern Ireland tends to be at the wrong end of most UK data tables.
Wages and productivity are low, economic inactivity and rates of long-term illness are high.
The ONS have been grappling with this seeming contradiction.
Its analysis shows that health, employment status and relationship status are key factors related to well-being.
But, these can't explain the Northern Ireland result - something else is going on.
The ONS have identified three potential answers.
Firstly, it could be down to the way in which people in Northern Ireland respond to the surveys that produce the well-being data.
There is evidence that people in different countries respond differently to well-being surveys.
It is, after all, a subjective measurement, so different populations will bring their own cultural experiences to the surveys.
Secondly, it could be a reflection of ongoing positive expectations that have flowed from the peace process.
The substantive ending of violence in the late 1990s was a break with a grim and bloody past.
So maybe people in Northern Ireland, unlike other parts of the UK, have seen that life can improve and so have an expectation it will continue to improve.
The third potential answer is the most interesting.
The ONS has identified Northern Ireland as having high levels of social capital - that is the links, shared values and understandings that enable individuals and groups to trust each other and work together.
So higher social capital tends to be related to higher well-being.
About 73% of people in Northern Ireland reported that most people in their neighbourhood can be trusted, compared with just 56% in London.
A whopping 80% of people surveyed in Northern Ireland said that others in their local area were willing to help their neighbours, which is again the highest level in the UK.
How do those numbers square with the divided nature of Northern Ireland society?
Well, there are two types of social capital - bonding and bridging.
Bonding capital describes the links between homogenous groups - in Northern Ireland what could be described as intra-community.
Bridging capital is about the links between heterogeneous groups or in Northern Ireland what is called cross-community.
So it raises the question - do high levels of bonding social capital explain the high level of well-being?
Or to put it another way - does living in a divided society make us happy?
