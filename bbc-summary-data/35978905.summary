The soap star earlier tweeted that the medication she was taking had stopped being manufactured.
A show source then confirmed that she would be "taking time off" from her role as Liz McDonald in the long-running ITV drama.
An ITV spokesperson said Ms Callard was set to return to work in May.
The actress confirmed to a fan on Twitter the latest update in her health battle.
She said that her medication had been pulled from production as it yielded "no profit", and added: "Saw a new Doctor today. Got hope! X".
Callard, 59, also told her followers: "Had a good day today, things are on the up! Thank you for being there!!!!! X"
She had tweeted earlier that she had "been battling the demons of depression" and thanked fans and fellow stars for their support.
The actress has been open about her struggles with mental health and in an interview with broadcaster Piers Morgan in 2014, said she had tried to take her life "maybe half a dozen times".
She said: "It wasn't a cry for help at all. I'd known for quite a while that I wasn't myself, but I didn't really know what to do about it."
