England women marked Charlotte Edwards's 200th game as captain with a five-wicket win over New Zealand that sealed the Twenty20 series 2-1.

England restricted the hosts to 97-9, Heather Knight, Danielle Hazell and Laura Marsh taking two wickets each.
Knight then made 26 and Lydia Greenway 25 as England reached their target with eight balls to spare in Lincoln.
Edwards, who scored five, said: "There was a lot of hype, but in our dressing room it was all about the series win."
ECB managing director Paul Downton was among those in attendance and prior to the match made a presentation to the 35-year-old who says she wants to play on to the 2017 World Cup.
"There were a few tears walking out but it was great to have people here to mark the occasion," she told BBC Sport.
Edwards, who made her England debut in 1996 at the age of 16 and took over as captain in 2005, became the first England player - man or woman - to captain in 200 internationals.
The Kent batter has presided over three Ashes series wins as well as the World Cup and World T20 successes of 2009.
In 2014 she became only the second woman to be named one of Wisden's Cricketers of the Year.
Winning the toss and inviting the hosts to bat at the Bert Sutcliffe Oval, Edwards saw her spinners stifle New Zealand.
After home captain Suzie Bates was held on the leg-side boundary in the third over, it began a procession in which only two Kiwis passed double figures.
Indeed, if it had not been Sophie Devine's 31-ball 37, including a straight six off Jenny Gunn, the contest would have been even more one-sided.
Although opener Edwards was bowled trying to cut Lea Tahuhu early on, Knight and Sarah Taylor ensured the England chase began with good momentum.
They fell in quick succession, leaving Greenway and Natalie Sciver to push the tourists to the brink of victory.
A succession a dot balls prolonged the match, but Katherine Brunt's six sealed Edwards's 129th victory as captain.
"I'm really proud of the way of the way we played and to win in a convincing manner was really pleasing," Edwards said.
On Thursday (21:30 GMT on Wednesday), the sides will resume the one-day series which preceded the T20s, with New Zealand leading 2-1 and two games remaining.
