[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
If Top Gear fans haven't been won over by the show's current presenting line-up - an alternative is coming.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A new US version of the car show is being made by BBC America with actor William Fichtner among the hosts.
Fichtner is known for such films as The Dark Knight and Black Hawk Down and TV series like Prison Break and Invasion.
He will be joined by drag racer Antron Brown and car journalist Tom "Wookie" Ford. Ex-Friends star Matt LeBlanc is among the hosts of the UK version.
He heads a relatively new line-up following the departures of Jeremy Clarkson, Richard Hammond and James May, and then the exit of Chris Evans.
The new US show will premiere later this year and will have eight hour-long episodes. It will be shown    on BBC America alongside the British version.
TopGear.com said the Stig would be present, as would a weekly guest celebrity and "the cars that have defined America's past, racing across the highways and historic tracks of the American west".
It is not known whether the US Top Gear will be broadcast in the UK, although other BBC America series are available. For example, Orphan Black and Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency are on Netflix in Britain.
A previous American version of Top Gear was shown on BBC Three in the UK. That programme, which was broadcast on The History Channel in the US, was cancelled last year.
