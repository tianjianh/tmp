[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Wallace and Mark Lambert went over inside six minutes before Agustin Cavalieri was sin-binned for the hosts.
Jack Clifford and Ross Chisholm touched down either side of Wallace's second try to make it 29-3 at the break.
Matt Hopper, Kyle Sinckler and Charlie Walker added further tries, while Maxime Mbanda grabbed a consolation.
Victory restored Quins' five-point lead at the top of Pool Three after Cardiff Blues went joint top on Friday, following their bonus-point win over Montpellier.
Wallace got the Premiership side off to the perfect start, bundling over from a line-out after just a minute.
Ben Botica failed to land the extras, but added the first of five conversions when Lambert went in soon after.
Calvisano were breached just once, with Clifford going over, when reduced to 14-men following Cavalieri's sin-binning on 10 minutes, and the hosts also managed their only first-half response while a man down, Filippo Buscema teeing up a penalty.
Wallace's second try saw Quins secure their third bonus point from three games on 25 minutes, with Quins running in a further four tries either side of the break at the Centro Sportivo San Michele in Lombardy.
