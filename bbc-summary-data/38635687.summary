Plymouth Argyle boss Derek Adams says it was difficult for his side to focus on their League Two win over Stevenage as they prepare to face Liverpool.

The Pilgrims came from behind to win 4-2 ahead of the FA Cup third-round replay with the Premier League giants.
Argyle secured Wednesday's replay with Liverpool after drawing 0-0 at Anfield on 8 January against the youngest-ever side fielded by the Reds.
"It's been very difficult for us," Adams said after the Stevenage win.
"We've got people talking about the Liverpool game since we drew at Anfield and everybody else around the place forgot about the Stevenage game.
"We've seen everything goes around the football club and to be fair to the players they've shown a lot of grit and determination to get through the game."
Plymouth have extended the loans of Bristol City striker Paul-Arnold Garita and Reading midfielder Craig Tanner until the end of the season.
Garita, 21, has scored two goals in 14 appearances for the Pilgrims but missed a penalty in Argyle's FA Cup second-round replay against Newport County.
Tanner, who spent all of last season on loan at Home Park, has netted five times for the Pilgrims this season.
The 22-year-old's contract at Reading runs out in the summer.
"Both of them have come into the football club and had a lot of game time," Adams told BBC Radio Devon.
"They've helped the team by scoring goals and assisting with goals and they've been important players for us."
