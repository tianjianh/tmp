The 22-year-old put Spain ahead with a finish from just inside the box, but Italy equalised through Federico Bernardeschi's deflected shot despite having Roberto Gagliardini sent off.
Saul restored Spain's lead with a fantastic 30-yard drive three minutes later, and completed his treble by turning in first time from Real Madrid winger Marco Asensio's low cross.
Germany earlier booked their place in Friday's final (a 19:45 BST kick-off) with victory over England in a penalty shootout.
