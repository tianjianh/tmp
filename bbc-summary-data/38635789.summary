[SN]TITLE[SN]
John Quinn: Isle of Man law chief appointed by the Queen

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A Manx advocate has been appointed as the Isle of Man's new law chief.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Senior lawyer John Quinn has served as acting attorney general since 2013 after his predecessor Stephen Harding was suspended on charges of perjury and committing acts against public justice.
Mr Harding was acquitted of all charges in 2014 but retired on grounds of ill health in September.
Mr Quinn, an advocate with 30 years' experience, said it was a "great honour to be appointed by HM the Queen".
He added: "I will endeavour to serve the Crown and the Isle of Man community to the best of my abilities."
The position is a Crown appointment and not a government post.
The attorney general acts as legal adviser to the Lieutenant Governor, Council of Ministers and all government departments and represents the Crown in the prosecution of offences and drafting of legislation.
Mr Quinn has a seat on the Isle of Man's Legislative Council but cannot vote in Tynwald.
The government said arrangements are being made for an official swearing-in ceremony.
