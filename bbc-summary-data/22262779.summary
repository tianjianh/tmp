Plans to reopen a whisky distillery after more than 90 years will create about 20 jobs in southern Scotland.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
VisitScotland chairman Mike Cantlay is to visit the historic Annandale Distillery building to see progress.
It was built in the early 1830s and was later run by Johnnie Walker, but closed down in 1919.
Restoration work got under way two years ago and is due for completion this month, with an opening in early 2014 planned.
In 2007, the site, which was on the buildings at risk register, was bought by Prof David Thomson and his wife Theresa.
Once it reopens the facility will offer distillery tours, whisky tastings, educational facilities, a visitor centre, shop and cafÃ©.
It is hoped it can attract some 50,000 visitors a year.
Mr Cantlay said: "The redevelopment of Annandale Distillery is absolutely fantastic news for Dumfries and Galloway and indeed Scotland.
"The project being developed sounds magnificent and this substantial investment into tourism is an investment into Scotland's, and indeed the region's, future.
"It's so exciting that Annandale Distillery will be ready to welcome visitors during Scotland's year of homecoming, which looks set to impress visitors from near and far."
