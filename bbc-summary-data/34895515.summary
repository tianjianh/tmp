It happened at about 01:30 on Saturday on a lane between Great Western Road and the Auchentoshan Estate.
Police said an 18-year-old man and three boys aged 15 were "intentionally targeted" by another group of men.
They are treating the incident as attempted murder and have appealed for anyone with information to contact them.
The four teenagers were taken to hospital. Two of the 15-year-olds were suffering life threatening injuries. The 18-year-old and the other 15-year-old were released after treatment.
Det Sgt Darren Munogee said: "This type of violence will not be tolerated on our streets and I would offer reassurance to the public that we are doing all we can to trace the people responsible.
"Although the exact motive is still to be ascertained, we believe that the victims were intentionally targeted.
"We have a dedicated team that will trace the persons responsible. Our inquiries are continuing. We have utilised specialist search and forensic teams and are continuing to analyse available CCTV.
"We have increased our high visiblity patrols in the area and officers are continuing to conduct door-to-door inquiries."
