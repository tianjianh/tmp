Plans to expand training facilities at newly-promoted Bournemouth have gone on display.

The proposals outline adding a third training pitch to the Premier League club's facilities in Kings Park.
Chairman Jeff Mostyn said the club has had to make several changes to comply with Premier League requirements.
However, it has already said it will not expand the capacity of its Goldsands Stadium for the Cherries' first season in the top flight.
As part of the plans, the pavilion will house changing rooms, a players' lounge and treatment rooms.
Proposals also include fencing to provide greater privacy for Eddie Howe's squad during training sessions, the club said.
Mr Mostyn said the club felt the proposals were "sympathetic to local residents and members of the public alike".
"There are several changes the club has had to make to ensure we comply with a number of Premier League requirements, in addition to ensuring the team has a facility worthy of a club that is totally committed to being competitive at the highest level,'' he added.
The exhibition was held held in the Champions Restaurant at Goldsands Stadium from 16:00 to 19:00 BST.
With a capacity of 11,700, Goldsands Stadium will be the smallest in the Premier League.
