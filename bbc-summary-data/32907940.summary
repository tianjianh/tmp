An image of seven more potential Hillsborough witnesses has been released by the police team providing new evidence for investigators.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The picture released by Operation Resolve of people caught up in the disaster on 15 April 1989 comes after three previous witness appeals.
Pictures of 59 people have already been released, with 28 identified so far.
Ninety six Liverpool FC fans died following the crush at the FA Cup semi-final at the Hillsborough stadium.
The appeal was launched at the request of coroner Sir John Goldring and the victims' families.
Investigators urged people to heed warnings and advice issued by the coroner and the office of the Attorney General about not passing comment on the appeal or any other aspect of the disaster on social media and forums.
Images of all those yet to be traced are shown on the Operation Resolve website.
The fresh inquests being held in Warrington, Cheshire, are due to continue on 1 June.
