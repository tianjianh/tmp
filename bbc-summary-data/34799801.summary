Liam Laverick, 25, had denied the manslaughter of Tommy Lee, who died after being shaken or thrown.
Laverick, from Hull, claimed he had been carrying his son to hospital when he panicked and tripped.
But a Hull Crown Court jury found him guilty of killing Tommy Lee. Laverick was ordered to serve half his sentence before he is considered for release.
A post-mortem examination found the youngster, who died last September, suffered bleeding around his brain.
Jurors heard Laverick, of Beeford Grove, Hull, had been left in the sole care of Tommy Lee at his partner's flat.
The court heard Laverick's account of what happened to his son had never been consistent.
Mr Justice Baker said his "conduct has been discreditable".
His persistent accounts of how Tommy Lee had died meant the finger of suspicion had been pointed at the baby's mother, Kelly Whitworth, the judge added.
The jury was previously shown CCTV footage of Laverick taking Tommy Lee to a relative's house to find Ms Whitworth, before the couple ran to the nearby Hull Royal Infirmary.
The court was also told that Tommy Lee's body had only been returned to the family in the past week.
Following the verdict, Det Ch Insp Phil Gadd, from Humberside Police, said: "Tommy Lee was a defenceless baby who was less than a month old when he tragically died.
"He had his life cruelly taken away from him and justice has today been done for him.
In an interview to the BBC, Gemma Bamforth, a former girlfriend and mother of Laverick's eldest son, described him as an "evil" and abusive ex-partner.
