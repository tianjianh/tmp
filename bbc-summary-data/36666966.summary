[SN]TITLE[SN]
Man ordered to tell police of sex plans to go on hunger strike

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man cleared of rape who must give police 24 hours' notice before he has sex is to go on hunger strike in protest over the ruling.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The man, in his 40s, was acquitted last year at a retrial but is the subject of an interim sexual risk order (SRO).
He said the law had been "misapplied deliberately by North Yorkshire Police" and he would "commence hunger strike in protest over the SRO".
The force said it was "satisfied that our actions are justified".
Sexual risk orders were introduced in England and Wales last year and can be applied to any individual who the police believe poses a risk of sexual harm - even if they have never been convicted of a crime.
The order requires this individual to disclose any planned sexual activity to the police or face up to five years in prison.
In a statement, he said: "I protest that even though a jury found me unanimously not guilty, after nearly two years I still find myself being punished for a crime that never happened.
"I protest to being subject to an order that is unlawful in almost every syllable, is unjustified and is so extreme as to be utterly unliveable.
He accused the force of "sour grapes" in applying for the order after his acquittal.
He said if his protests were ignored his hunger strike would "continue to either a satisfactory or a natural conclusion".
A North Yorkshire Police spokesperson said its application for an SRO was considered necessary "to protect the public from the risk of sexual harm".
Sexual risk orders are civil orders imposed by magistrates at the request of police.
The order was extended in January for four months after it was initially imposed in December.
The case is due back before York Magistrates on 14 July ahead of a hearing on 19 August, which will decide whether to make the interim order permanent.
The man, who said the complainant had consented to sex, was cleared of rape after being held on remand for 14 months.
It declares he "must disclose the details of any female including her name, address and date of birth... at least 24 hours prior to any sexual activity taking place".
It also lists restrictions on his use of the internet and mobile phones and requires him to inform officers of any change of address.
