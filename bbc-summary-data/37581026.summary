The players released a joint statement saying that they were not responsible for leaking the video of a "private act involving fully consenting adults".
The pair were dropped for Eibar's friendly against fellow La Liga side Leganes on Wednesday.
Luna joined Villa from Sevilla in 2013, playing 17 times for the English side.
The statement, signed by both players, added: "We hope this incident won't degrade the image of the club or of our team-mates."
They added they were sorry if the video "offended our fans and the city of Eibar in general'.'
