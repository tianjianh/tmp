[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Mariners, who are eighth in League Two, have been without a manager since Paul Hurst left to join League One side Shrewsbury Town on 24 October.
Bignot, who joined Solihull in 2011, led the Moors to promotion in April.
The Birmingham-born former QPR defender, 42, has worked without a contract in his five years at Solihull.
But he indicated in September that he was ready to sign his first deal at Damson Park.
Solihull are 15th in the National League table.
A Solihull club statement said: "The board wishes to place on record that, whilst it would not wish to stand in the way of an individual's ambition, it is eager to retain the services of Bignot to continue the progression he has made at the club in his five-year tenure.
"It is hoped that the talks will reach a swift resolution to ensure minimum disruption for all parties. The club will endeavour to update supporters in due course."
