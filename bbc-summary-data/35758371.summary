Formerly of Newport Gwent Dragons' under-16 development squad, the 19-year-old failed an out-of-competition test on 8 June, 2015.
He becomes the 12th Welsh rugby player serving a drugs ban.
UK Anti-Doping (Ukad) confirmed Buttifant is banned from 24 June 2015 to midnight on 23 June 2017.
Nicole Sapstead, Ukad's chief executive said: "Adam Buttifant is a young rugby player who had a promising playing career ahead of him.
"Athletes must follow the principal of 'Strict Liability', which means they are solely responsible for any banned substance found in their system, whether or not there is an intention to cheat.
"This can be challenging for an athlete - they have to be aware of the danger to their career at all times and make sure they carry out the correct and proper research before taking any supplement or medication."
Rhymney Valley club Bargoed won Welsh rugby's third tier Championship division in 2014-15.
