Turkey-Russia row: A brief history of presidential war of words

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The shooting down by Turkey of a Russian war plane on its border with Syria last week has led to an almost daily war of words between the nations' leaders.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Russia has demanded an apology but Turkey has repeatedly defended its actions.
The Russian Su-24, an all-weather attack aircraft, was shot down by Turkish F-16s in the Turkey-Syria border area on 24 November.
Turkey says the plane was repeatedly warned for violating Turkish airspace. Russia says there was no violation and no warnings.
Mr Putin insists the plane was not over Turkish territory and was operating in the mountains of northern Syria, and warns of "serious consequences".
President Recep Tayyip Erdogan says Turkey's actions are "fully in line with Turkey's rules of engagement" and that "everyone should respect the right of Turkey to defend its borders".
Mr Erdogan focuses on Russia's support for Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.
Mr Putin also broadens the line of attack.
How Putin acts in a crisis
Mr Putin insists it was "impossible" for Turkey not to have known it was shooting at a Russian plane.
He says Russia had not received "a clear apology" from Turkish leaders, nor any offer of compensation or promise to "punish the criminals".
A defiant Mr Erdogan says his country does not need to apologise for violations of its airspace. However, he does appear more conciliatory.
The downing of the plane: What we know
Mr Erdogan accuses Russia of using the downing of the jet "as an excuse to make unacceptable accusations against us", and accuses Russians of "mistreating" Turkish citizens who were in the country for a trade fair.
However, he again sounds a note of conciliation, suggesting a meeting with Mr Putin at the upcoming Paris climate summit.
President Putin signs a decree imposing sanctions on Turkey.
President Erdogan says he is "saddened" by the downing of the plane but does not use the word sorry.
Mr Putin rejects a request from Mr Erdogan for a meeting at the Paris summit and launches into another attack.
He says "we're all sorry" about the state of Russia's relations with Turkey now. "I myself did a great deal to build those relations over a long period."
The allegation infuriates Mr Erdogan, who threatens to resign if Turkish government involvement is such a scheme is proven.
