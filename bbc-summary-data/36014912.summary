Wigan head coach Shaun Wane says he was relaxed about the 62-0 loss to Wakefield because of the circumstances that left him without 11 players.

A combination of injuries and a virus spreading through the squad depleted Wane's options for the match.
The defeat was the Warriors' heaviest in Super League since 2005 as the Wildcats ran in 11 tries.
"I'm really glad the Wigan fans stayed behind at the end and clapped the players," said 51-year-old Wane.

He told BBC Radio Manchester: "I'm sure they understand the situation we're in and nobody else in Super League probably will.
"People will be glad we've been beaten that way, but in the inner circle of the club I'm very, very relaxed.
"I'm really disappointed with the scoreline but I am a realist and I know what has gone on - nobody outside the club knows."
