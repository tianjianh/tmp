The captain of the women's team reached 6,028 runs by scoring 69 in India's World Cup group-game defeat by Australia at Bristol on Wednesday.
A day later, accolades haven't stopped with most Twitter users saying Raj's achievement has taken women's cricket to new heights in India.
India are due to play New Zealand on Saturday in a must-win game.
The 34-year-old passed former England captain Charlotte Edwards' tally of 5,992.
Raj, who made her debut in 1999, was playing her 183rd ODI and averages 51.52. She has also played 10 Tests and 63 Twenty20s.
Most Twitter users feel that Raj's record will make women's cricket more popular in India.
