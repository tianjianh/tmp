Dog found buried alive in Redcar with nail in head

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A dog was found buried alive with a nail in its head in Teesside in what the RSPCA has described as a "horrifying, cruel act".

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A couple walking in Kirkleatham Woods, Redcar, heard whimpering and found the terrier-type animal in a mound of earth at about midday.
It was rushed to a vet but its injuries were so serious it had to be put down.
The RSPCA said more than one person would have been involved.
Inspector Nick Jones said:  "In all my ten years working for the RSPCA, I have never known anything so horrifying and inexplicably cruel.
"It's likely more than one person was involved due to the force needed to inflict such an attack."
The dog was a white, scruffy-looking terrier type with a curly coat - possibly a Jack Russell or West Highland Terrier cross-breed - aged about seven years old.
Anyone with information is urged to come forward.
