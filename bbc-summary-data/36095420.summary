Hanan Abramovich is accused of failing to pay for gems taken from 12 leading diamond dealers, Israeli media said.
The arrest of Mr Abramovich by Israeli police followed a complaint by the Israel Diamond Exchange (IDE), the world's largest.
There are fears several diamond firms could face bankruptcy.
Members of the exchange were encouraged to come forward with information.
Identifying Mr Abramovich, a police spokeswoman said: "The suspect is under arrest and we are currently questioning him on suspicion of embezzlement."
Adi Carmeli, Mr Abramovich's lawyer, confirmed his client had been arrested but denied he was involved in any criminal activity.
IDE managing director Eli Avidar accused Mr Abramovich of stringing along diamond firms to whom he owed millions of dollars.
Mr Avidar said the exchange's board of directors would "show zero tolerance to anyone who harmed other members of the exchange".
Mr Abramovich appeared in court on Wednesday, where his arrest was reportedly extended for two days.
Israel's diamond industry dates back to the 1930s and now boasts more than 1,000 trading firms based in the city of Ramat Gan.
