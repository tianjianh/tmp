Do you know the people in these pictures of tenement life?

A photographer who pictured Scots living in tenement slums 45 years ago is now hoping to be reunited with his subjects.

Nick Hedges took the photos for housing charity Shelter in Glasgow and Edinburgh.
He now wants to meet the people in his pictures to find out what happened to them.
The images will be featured in an exhibition in Edinburgh's St Andrew Square until 30 October.
Mr Hedges, who is now 73, said: "It would be wonderful to meet the children I photographed all those years ago and to hear their stories. I often wonder what happened to them, if they went on to lead happy and healthy lives.
"When I was commissioned by Shelter to take these photographs, I never imagined that decades later they would still have such impact - none more so than on me personally.
"The poverty and terrible conditions I witnessed shocked me to the core. My hope is that all these years later, by reconnecting with some of those I photographed, I am able to hear good news of what happened to the families."
Director of Shelter Scotland Graeme Brown said: "I encourage anyone who recognises themselves, or family members and friends to get in touch with us. We want to hear the stories behind these iconic images, and in particularly what happened after they were taken.
"These photographs are a sobering piece of history not only for Shelter Scotland, but the nation as a whole and it's important to preserve the stories behind them."
