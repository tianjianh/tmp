AP McCoy prepares for last ride in Cheltenham Gold Cup

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Retiring 19-time champion AP McCoy will ride Carlingford Lough as he competes in jump racing's showpiece Cheltenham Gold Cup for the final time on Friday.

McCoy, a winner on Uxizandre on Thursday, will face 15 rivals with wet conditions expected for the big race.
The ground is Good to Soft after 5mm of rain overnight, with more expected before the Gold Cup (15:20 GMT).
Silviniaco Conti, trained by Paul Nicholls, heads the field, along with Djakadam for Willie Mullins.
Last year's winner Lord Windermere and 2013 victor Bobs Worth return.
Other contenders include Hennessy Gold Cup winner Many Clouds, Irish hopeful Road To Riches, plus novice Coneygree and two-time Festival winner Holywell.
The 40-year-old Northern Irishman broke his duck for the 2015 meeting at the 12th attempt, with Thursday's victory in the Ryanair Chase.
His wife Chanelle said: "It's unique here. The buzz of the winner's enclosure - he just wanted that feeling one more time."
McCoy, the 2010 BBC Sports Personality of the Year who has ridden more than 4,300 winners in his career, announced last month he would retire by the end of the season, which concludes on 25 April.
He won the Irish Hennessy Gold Cup the following day at Leopardstown on Carlingford Lough, trained by John Kiely, for owner JP McManus.
His last ride at the home of jump racing will be at 17:15 GMT on Ned Buntline in the race named after him.
Eight-time champion trainer Paul Nicholls dominated the Gold Cup a few years ago with his steeplechasing greats Kauto Star and Denman, who were in neighbouring boxes at his Somerset stables.
After their retirement, he has enjoyed two wins in the festive jump racing highlight, the King George VI Chase at Kempton, with the talented Silviniaco Conti.
But his ante-post favourite needs to improve on a record at the track - which reads third, fell, fourth - albeit he had a big chance when falling late on in the Gold Cup two years ago.
Nicholls believes he can do better, and has also been keen to stress the each-way chance of stablemate Sam Winner.
Betting on the Gold Cup is likely to be affected by the rain, with a change in the going potentially affecting the chances of horses who prefer particular ground.
So for example, Djakadam - the mount of all-time leading Festival jockey Ruby Walsh - is thought likely to appreciate softer conditions.
However, ante-post favourite Silviniaco Conti could find it tougher to see out the three-and-a-quarter-mile trip.
His stablemate Sam Winner was being backed on Friday morning, while Houblon Des Oubeaux could be an interesting outsider at about 50-1.
