Strike vote looms over Glasgow City Council public holiday change

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Hundreds of staff at Scotland's largest local authority are to be asked to vote on strike action over changes to public holiday entitlement.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Glasgow City Council's budget, which was passed on Thursday, transferred six days public holiday to annual leave and cut holiday entitlement for new staff.
The GMB union said it would call for a strike vote as the changes could cost some members up to £1,000 in lost pay.
The council said it had consulted with unions throughout the budget process.
Benny Rankin, GMB organiser for Glasgow City Council, said: "It's rather ironic that one of the last remaining Labour councils in Scotland have proposed to do away with the May Day Holiday.
"For our members, however, it's more serious as this change will have a big impact on their earning levels.
"We estimate these changes will cost workers between £500 and £1,000 per year."
Mr Rankin added: "GMB members have already signalled that they refuse to lose a penny off their pay and GMB will oppose these actions with all means available including industrial action."
A council spokesman said: "The council is facing a spending gap of £130m over the next two years following the biggest ever cut to our budget from the Scottish government.
"We have been consulting with trade unions throughout our budget planning process and remain open to further talks.
"Converting six public holidays to annual leave will provide staff with greater flexibility.
"We're not preventing them from taking those days off - if employees want to continue to take a day off on a particular public holiday they can use annual leave to do so, subject to operational requirements."
Two weeks ago, the union announced that a consultative ballot of more than 1,000 staff resulted in 95% backing for industrial action.
Mr Rankin said that a ballot approving strike action would go ahead soon unless the council changed its position.
