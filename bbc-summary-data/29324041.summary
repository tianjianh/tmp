Paul Martin inquest: Stroud man's death 'accidental'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An inquest has been told a simple error may have led to the death of a motorcyclist on a railway line.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Paul Martin, 37, from Stroud, Gloucestershire, was killed at the Frampton Mansell level crossing in May.
John Wilson, from British Transport Police, told the court Mr Martin and two other riders had failed to contact signallers who would have told them of the approaching train.
A verdict of accidental death was recorded by coroner Katy Skerrett.
She said Mr Martin had multiple injuries consistent with being hit by a train.
But Mr Wilson told the court he was satisfied the train driver had done everything he could to avoid the collision.
