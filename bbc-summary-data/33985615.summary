Dreamliner 787 Heathrow fire 'may be caused by short circuit'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A fire on a parked Boeing 787 Dreamliner jet at Heathrow Airport two years ago was probably caused by a short circuit, air accident investigators have said.

The fire was likely to have been started by two bare wires touching in a piece of location equipment, the UK Air Accidents Investigations Branch said.
It then spread through the cabin and burnt through the fuselage.
Investigators recommended tighter testing and certification of devices.
The piece of equipment that caught fire - the Emergency Locator Transmitter (ELT) - was located near the back of the plane, and was made by Honeywell.
The battery-powered transmitter is designed to detect unusual deceleration, such as the force produced by a crash, and to transmit a distress signal.
The device in the 787 had positive and negative cables that were too long to fit into the box housing the device, and so ended up touching one another.
Testing had predicted that the worst reaction from a short circuit would be the batteries running down.
Unfortunately, what actually happened was what investigators called "a thermal runaway" - a fire that spread from one battery cell to the next.
On the ground, the skin of the aircraft was pierced by the heat and the flames.
