Barnsley made it three home wins out of three in the Championship with victory over south Yorkshire rivals Rotherham.

After a first half of few clear-cut chances, centre-back Marc Roberts put them ahead following a free-kick.
Midfielder Adam Hammill doubled the lead when he cut inside before beating Lee Camp with a deflected shot.
Jon Taylor forced a good save from Adam Davies at the other end, but substitute Tom Bradshaw and Ryan Kent made it a comfortable win for Barnsley late on.
The home side gave summer signing Angus MacDonald his debut alongside Roberts, with Alfie Mawson poised for a move to Swansea City.
On a ground where they last won a league game in 1969, Rotherham struggled to earn enough possession to test the home defence.
And after conceding twice in the space of three minutes - Hammill celebrating the birth of a child this week with a typical strike - Taylor's shot was the only time Davies was seriously tested.
Sam Winnall, last season's top scorer for the Tykes, returned from injury and was withdrawn on the hour. But substitute Stefan Payne only lasted three minutes before picking up an injury, and he in turn was replaced by Wales international Bradshaw, who headed his first for the club from Andy Yiadom's cross.
Worse was to come for the Millers as their defence backed off to allow Kent, on loan from Liverpool, to fire the fourth into the top corner.
Barnsley head coach Paul Heckingbottom:
"I am delighted, the win is the most important, we have turned a good start into a very good one.
"We have shown we can win games in this league and if you want to achieve anything, that's what you have got to do.
"At half-time we didn't change anything but just asked for more quality and tempo and we were adamant we would get the win.
"The style of the win and the scoreline puts the icing on the cake. It has been a really positive start for us and we are delighted."
Rotherham boss Alan Stubbs:
"We have to look at ourselves, it has to mean more than it is showing at the moment. When you go 1-0 down the most important thing is to make sure you don't concede a second.
"We have had a chat about it at the end, it's not about ranting and raving, it's about all of us taking collective responsibility.
"Today is obviously very disappointing. If the players aren't prepared to work hard then we will have players out and have players in. There may be more going out than I originally expected.
"We could have done better than what we did, it's as simple as that. There's no substitute for hard work."
