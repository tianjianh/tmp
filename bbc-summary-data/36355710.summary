Despite hitting his ball into two water hazards, Garcia posted a two-under-par 68 to match overnight leader Brooks Koepka, who shot 71, on 15 under.
Garcia then won at the first extra hole after Koepka drove into water.
"I won a bit like Seve," said Garcia, whose win puts him firmly in contention for Europe's Ryder Cup team.
Europe take on the US in the biennial event in September at Hazeltine, Minnesota.
Garcia, a veteran of seven European teams, five of them victorious, said: "This is going to drop me nicely into the Ryder Cup points league. That means a lot."
Garcia beat Koepka by making par at the first play-off hole. It is his second triumph in this event, after also winning in 2004, and his first PGA Tour victory since 2012.
US Open champion Jordan Spieth, who began the day two off the lead, dropped away with a four-over-par 74 to finish five shots adrift of the leaders.
