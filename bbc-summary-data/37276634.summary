Bournemouth defender Tyrone Mings believes his 12-month spell on the sidelines because of a knee injury will benefit him in the long run.

The 23-year-old former Ipswich defender was carried off six minutes into his Premier League debut last August.
Mings made his long-awaited return against AC Milan in a testimonial match for Warren Cummings on Saturday.
"I have learnt a lot mentally and physically, I'm probably in a better place," he told BBC Radio Solent.
"It's nice to be back in the fold, back playing and injury-free.
"There was a lot of two steps forward one step back throughout the process, but I would not change it for the world and for the experience I'm probably a better person for it."
Midfielder Jack Wilshere, who signed a season-long loan deal with the Cherries on deadline day, also played 45 minutes against the Italian Serie A club.
And he could make his Premier League debut for Bournemouth at home to West Bromwich Albion this weekend.
"We are looking forward to working with him [Jack Wilshere] and getting to know him better," said Bournemouth manager Eddie Howe.
"We see him as an attacking midfielder and somebody to do damage on the opposition goal.
"And Tyrone is a huge boost for everybody connected to the club. He's worked so hard behind the scenes and that was the end of a long journey."
