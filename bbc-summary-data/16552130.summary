"Weightlifting is a great spectator sport as it is so fast-moving and the technique and strength on show from the athletes is just phenomenal. I cannot see Team GB getting any medals as both the men's and women's athletes's totals do not match up to the competition. For Zoe Smith, London 2012 is about gaining experience as she could go to four or five more Games due to her age. Peter Kirkbride is the most well known British male. China and Russia hold nearly all the world records in both sexes, with their competition for the medals likely to come from Turkey, Bulgaria and Greece.
Unfortunately, the sport of weightlifting cannot be spoken about without mentioning the drug abuse that has so often tainted it.
The sport has had its reputation tarnished in each of the last 10 Olympics, bar 1992 and 1996, by competitors failing drugs tests.
The International Weightlifting Federation has twice changed weight categories and as a result erased all world and Olympic records in an attempt to beat the drugs cheats.
Great Britain's first-ever Olympic champion was Launceston Elliot, who claimed gold in the one-hand lift in 1896. He remains Britain's only Olympic weightlifting champion.
Weightlifting helps boost your strength, muscle definition and energy levels. Depending on the style of weightlifting programme you perform, it can either build the size of your muscles or create longer, leaner muscles.
Although standard weightlifting is not a form of cardiovascular exercise, it can still help fat loss. An intense weightlifting training session burns approximately 266 calories per hour, with extra calorie loss still occurring up to 48 hours later due to muscle growth.
Special weightlifting programmes, such as tabata, can aid cardiovascular fitness as they require you to do repeat sets of as many repetitions as possible in a limited time period. This exercise improves stamina and lowers blood pressure.
As weightlifting is a form of resistance training, it also boosts your metabolic rate as muscles require calories to grow. The higher the weight you lift and more regularly you train, the quicker your metabolism should be.
Weightlifting also helps improve the density of your bones which helps to prevent osteoporosis from developing.
There are approximately 50 British Weightlifting accredited clubs in gyms, sport centres and universities throughout the United Kingdom.

The snatch is considered the technical lift and involves lifting the weight above the head in one movement.
Once the bar is lifted overhead, the competitor must remain motionless, arms and legs extended, with bar and body in a straight line, until given the green light by the referees.
The clean and jerk, which is considered the 'brute strength' lift, involves lifting the weight above the head in two movements.
Louis Hostin of France was so confident of winning the 1932 light heavyweight contest that he joked with the referee while lifting. His confidence was not misplaced; he duly won gold and retained his title four years later.
First, the lifter 'cleans' the barbell up to the shoulder/chest area, and then 'jerks' it above the head in one movement by way of an explosive motion from the legs.
When the movement is complete, the competitor must remain absolutely motionless until the signal from the referees is green.
An athlete's best lifts in both the snatch and clean and jerk are added together to provide their total score.
Each competitor has three attempts per weight in the snatch and likewise in the clean and jerk - if successful they progress to a higher weight, with a minimum 1kg increase.
Each competitor has one minute to start their attempt once their name has been announced or the loaders are off the platform, whichever comes last.
The only exception to this is if an athlete must take consecutive attempts - they are allowed two minutes in this instance, with a warning bell after 90 seconds.
If two competitors have lifted the same amount of weight, the athlete who weighs the least will be declared the winner.

Teenager Zoe Smith is the poster girl of British weightlifting and achieved the Olympic 'A' standard twice this year, most notably at the European Championships, where she finished fourth in the lightweight division. A medal would represent a huge, and unexpected, achievement.
China excelled on home soil in 2008 with eight gold medals and added six world titles last year. Kazakhstan's Ilya Ilin won middle heavyweight gold in Beijing and took the world title last December.
Iranian super heavyweight Behdad Salimikordasiabi has been unstoppable in the last two years, winning back-to-back world titles.
Weightlifting was practised both by ancient Egyptian and Greek societies and developed as an international sport primarily in the 19th century.
Men's weightlifting was on the programme in the first modern Olympic Games in 1896, missed out at the 1900, 1908 and 1912 editions, but has been an ever-present since then.
It appeared under the athletics umbrella until 1920 when the press, snatch, and clean & jerk techniques were introduced.
Men: Bantam (56kg), feather (62kg), light (69kg), middle (77kg), light heavy (85kg), middle heavy (94kg), heavy (105kg), super heavy (+105kg)
Women: Fly (48kg), feather (53kg), light (58kg), middle (63kg), light heavy (69kg), heavy (75kg), super heavy (+75kg)
It was not until the 2000 Games in Sydney that women were allowed to compete at Olympic level.
Bulgarian Izabeta Dragneva won an historic first gold medal but she was quickly stripped of it after the banned diuretic furosemide was found in her system.
The most famous weightlifter in Olympic history is the USA's 1948 light heavyweight silver medallist, Harold Sakata.
Although not famous at the time of the Games, he later became a professional wrestler by the name of Tosh Togo before embarking on an acting career during which he gained international stardom playing the role of Oddjob in the 1964 James Bond film Goldfinger.
The heaviest individual weight lifted in Olympic competition was achieved by Hossein Rezazadeh of Iran when he clean-and-jerked 262.5kg in Athens in 2004.
This is the equivalent of five flyweight boxers or two-and-a half times the size of the baby male elephant born in Berlin Zoo in May this year.
Britain's most recent medallist was David Mercer, who took bronze in 1984.
