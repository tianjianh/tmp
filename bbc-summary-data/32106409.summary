Unbeaten Brook defended his IBF world welterweight title on Saturday with a fourth-round victory over Romanian-born Jo Jo Dan in his hometown of Sheffield.
Promoter Eddie Hearn then called for 28-year-old Brook to fight Bolton's Khan at Wembley in June.
"There's a venue available on 13 June," Hearn said at the Motorpoint Arena. "If Amir Khan is watching, give everyone what they want."
He added: "He doesn't have an opponent and he is talking about fighting boxers lower than Kell. It's the biggest pay-day available and it's for a world title."
Brook previously said a fight with Khan was "gone for the year" and was instead focusing on a meeting the winner of Floyd Mayweather and Manny Pacquiao, who fight on 2 May in Las Vegas.
But Brook, fighting for the first time since he was stabbed in the leg while on holiday in Tenerife, said on Saturday he wants to fight Khan, 28, who beat Devon Alexander in his last fight before Christmas.
"If you're watching, Amir Khan, then get in here with me. I know you're delicate around the whiskers," said Brook.
Referring to his recent injury, he added: "I didn't think I would walk again, never mind box again. Now I'm here defending my title.
"I've come from a council estate, now I'm world champion. I've come from the bottom and I'm at the top."
