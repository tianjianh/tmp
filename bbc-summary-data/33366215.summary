Scotch 'given protected status' in Botswana

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Scotch whisky has been given protected geographical status in Africa for the first time, according to industry representatives.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Scotch Whisky Association (SWA) said Botswana now recognised the spirit as a geographical indication (GI).
The move means only whisky that has been made in Scotland can legally be sold as Scotch in the country.
SWA said the "legal breakthrough" gave consumers a high level of protection against fakes.
Whisky shipments to Botswana increased by 163% last year to reach nearly Â£457,000, according to SWA figures.
The trade body said it expected to see demand for Scotch increase in African countries in future years as economies on the continent grew.
Chief executive David Frost said: "Botswana recognising Scotch as a GI - a product that must be made in Scotland - is ground-breaking as it's the first product to be given this status.
"It's also the first time Scotch has been successfully registered as a GI anywhere in Africa.
"This move will protect consumers and give a boost to the growth of Scotch exports across Africa."
According to SWA, Scotch is now officially recognised in the laws of more than 70 countries, including the whole of the European Union.
To qualify as a genuine product, Scotch must be made in Scotland from water, cereals and yeast and matured for at least three years.
