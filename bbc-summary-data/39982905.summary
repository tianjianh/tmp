[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Dawid Malan struck a crucial unbeaten century as Middlesex took the upper hand against Surrey on an absorbing second day at Lord's.

The 29-year-old reached his ton from 169 balls - with 14 fours - as captain James Franklin hit 63 off 67 balls.
Franklin earlier had Kumar Sangakkara caught behind for 114 as the visitors collapsed from 265-5 to 311 all out.
Surrey took regular wickets, with Mark Footitt claiming 3-83, but the hosts recovered from 204-5 to close on 296-5.
Sangakkara was ousted after adding just a single to his overnight score when Ollie Rayner took a spectacular one-handed catch at third slip.
Franklin claimed his second wicket in as many overs when Sam Curran nicked the ball to Rayner and Tom Helm (3-81) then mopped up the tail soon after as Surrey collected their third batting bonus point.
Middlesex's openers survived through to the break unscathed only for Curran to trap Nick Gubbins lbw the very first ball after lunch.
Stevie Eskinazi (67), put down on 29 by Scott Borthwick, hit his third Championship half-century this season but was caught behind off Footitt to bring an end to his 100-run third-wicket partnership with Malan.
When Adam Voges (9) and John Simpson (11) fell cheaply the home side looked in trouble, but Malan battened down the hatches as Franklin attacked from the off, contributing 63 to their 92-run sixth-wicket stand.
With the new ball available in just two overs' time, Surrey will be looking to make early breakthroughs on Sunday morning.
Middlesex century-maker Dawid Malan told BBC Radio London:
"I needed those runs. It was nice to contribute in a game we need to win. I've been making 20s and 30s, with the ball hitting the middle of the bat, so it was nice to convert my decent start into three figures.
"Our bowlers stuck to their guns this morning, especially having strayed from out plans yesterday. They were right on it and all credit to them for that session when they took 48-5.
"There's still a little bit in the pitch. If we can get another 120, then there's no reason why we can't put them under pressure and give ourselves something to chase on the last day."
Surrey coach Michael de Venuto told BBC Radio London:
"It was a disappointing day to lose five wickets for 48. The nature of our dismissals was poor.
"We certainly weren't got out, and that was a below-par total for us on that wicket.
"We have to put it behind us quickly and come out with a new ball and bowl like we know we're able to. There is still a lot of cricket to be played."
