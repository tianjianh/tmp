[SN]TITLE[SN]
Chesterfield 1-0 Coventry City

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Managerless Chesterfield came out on top in the League One relegation battle with Coventry City at the Proact Stadium, thanks to Dan Gardner's late second-half winner

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Gardner settled a poor contest in the 77th minute but Chesterfield had to survive 11 minutes of added time following an injury to their centre-back Tom Anderson.
And George Thomas missed a great chance to equalise when he fired over at the back post in stoppage time.
Chesterfield caretaker boss Ritchie Humphreys was in charge for the first time following the last weekend's sacking of Danny Wilson and Chris Morgan.
Spireites midfielder Jay O'Shea sent in a 30th-minute free-kick which Ian Evatt headed just over the bar before Ched Evans was too high three minutes later from a corner before Coventry went close when a low shot from Kevin Foley was flicked just wide by Stuart Beavon.
Sam Hird headed another O'Shea free-kick straight at Lee Burge in the 42nd minute and Marcus Tudgay had the ball in the Chesterfield net in the 56th minute but had strayed offside.
There was then a lengthy delay while Chesterfield defender Anderson was treated for a head injury before being stretchered off and Coventry had a great chance in the 72nd minute when George Thomas fired wide after a swift counter-attack.
But it proved as a costly miss five minutes later when Gardner's 25-yard shot flew into Burge's top left corner to plunge City back to the foot of the table.
