Venezuela 'receives $5bn in finance from China'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Venezuela has received $5bn (£3.4bn) in financing from China, Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro says.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The money was for "development", he said on Sunday, but gave no details.
The announcement comes three months after Mr Maduro travelled to China - a major investor in the region.
Venezuela is suffering from an acute economic crisis, as the price of its main export, oil, has almost halved over a year. The opposition accuses the government of mismanagement.
Mr Maduro visited Beijing in January and said at the time that China would invest more than $20bn in Venezuela.
He did not make clear in Sunday's announcement if these latest $5bn were part of that larger sum.
Loans by China's state-owned banks to Latin American countries rose by 71% to $22bn (£14bn) in 2014, according to estimates published by the China-Latin America Finance Database.
The Chinese loans exceed the combined worth of those by the World Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank, according to the database.
The $5bn will be a boost to Venezuela, which has been hit hard by falling oil price.  According to reports, 96% of its export revenues come from oil.
Figures from Venezuela's oil ministry suggest the price of Venezuelan oil has dropped from $97 in April 2014 to $50 this month.
Inflation in 2014 stood at more than 60% and there are widespread shortages of basic staples such a flour, cooking oil and milk.
