[SN]TITLE[SN]
Wellington's Waterloo dispatch arrives at Broadstairs

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An event to mark the arrival of a dispatch written by the Duke of Wellington telling Britain of the victory at Waterloo has taken place.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
In June 1815, Major Harry Percy arrived by rowing boat at Broadstairs in Kent with the news. From there the dispatch was taken by a fast carriage to the Prince Regent in London.
A group of volunteers have recreated the moment the boat arrived in Kent.
On Sunday, the dispatch will be taken through London.
The dispatch arrived earlier in the morning, landing at Viking Bay in Broadstairs.
It was then taken to Canterbury to be presented to the Lord Lieutenant of Kent, before a service marking Waterloo at Canterbury Cathedral.
On Sunday, it will arrive in London and be taken throughout the city.
In 1815, the ship carrying the dispatch began to drift in the English Channel. The decision was made to row for 20 miles to shore before landing at Broadstairs.
Rosalind Blinks, who is the Mayor of Broadstairs, said: "History was made here and history is often a quirk of fate, it wasn't their intended destination, so it is important that we honour the occasion."
The 200th anniversary of the battle has seen a series of events throughout Europe re-enacting important moments.
Earlier, thousands took part in a re-enactment of the battle of the same fields of Waterloo.
