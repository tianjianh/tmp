Former Olympic champion Kylie Palmer is clear to compete at the 2016 Games in Rio de Janeiro after receiving a warning for a doping violation.

World swimming's governing body Fina opted not to impose a ban on the 25-year-old, who tested positive to low levels of a masking agent in 2013.
Palmer chose to miss the World Championships in Russia in July while Fina investigated the offence.
"I sincerely hope that this process is now over," the Australian said.
"My number one goal is to represent Australia at the Rio Olympics in 2016 and I cannot wait to get back on track to achieving that dream."
Palmer, a member of the Australian 4x200m freestyle relay team that won Olympic gold in Beijing in 2008, said in a statement that she did not know how the prohibited substance came to be in her system.
She felt that the 21-month gap between providing the sample in July 2013 and receiving the result hindered the investigation.
"It has been a distressing few months since I was first notified of the positive test back in April 2015," she continued.
"Since that time, I made the decision to accept a provisional suspension and missed the Fina world championships in Kazan.
"I cannot get back that opportunity to represent my country internationally but I am now looking to the future."
