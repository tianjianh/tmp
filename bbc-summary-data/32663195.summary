Three RNLI volunteers have been injured after their lifeboat crashed in Rye Harbour during an emergency call.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Atlantic 85 inshore boat set off just after 01:00 BST on Thursday to a person calling for help in the River Rother at Rock Channel.
On the way, the boat hit a "submerged, unlit object", injuring the crew and damaging the boat, the charity said.
Two of the injured were taken by ambulance to hospital and are now recovering in hospital and at home.
The original casualty who called for help was assisted by a passer-by safely to shore, the charity said.
Rye Harbour was the scene of one of the RNLI's worst lifeboat disasters in its 165-year history when 17 crew lost their lives in 1928.
The charity said the Atlantic 85 inshore lifeboat had been in service since 2010.
