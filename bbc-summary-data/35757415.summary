Dyfed Steel manager 'siphoned off' £23k to his own business

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A company boss "siphoned off" £23,000 worth of orders from his employer to his own firm, a court heard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Hubert Cadenne de Lannoy, 36, from Newtown, Powys, was manager of the town's Dyfed Steels when he diverted business to his Agri Steels operation.
de Lannoy pleaded guilty to fraud at Mold Crown Court.
He had a 16-month jail sentence suspended for 18 months, was ordered to carry out 180 hours unpaid work and pay £23,000 compensation.
The court heard that de Lannoy had been manager at Dyfed Steels since 2007, with the deception taking place in 2013 and 2014.
Prosecutor Sion ap Mihangel said de Lannoy had claimed steel was being cut wrongly.
But he was then taking excess amounts and offering it through Agri Steels for about 10% cheaper.
In total, the court heard de Lannoy used £23,244 worth of Dyfed Steels' products to fulfil orders for his company.
Defence barrister John Hedgecoe said de Lannoy now employed six people at Agri Steels and could repay the money if allowed to continue trading.
Judge Eleri Rees called it "a cynical exercise", saying: "You were employed in a position of some trust being a general manager and set up your own company and started to siphon off orders and materials to your own company."
