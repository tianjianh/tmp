Pete McGrath remains in charge for fifth year at Fermanagh

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Pete McGrath is to stay in charge of the Fermanagh senior football team for another year, the county has announced.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The former Down boss has been the Erne County's manager since succeeding Peter Canavan in November 2013.
Fermanagh failed to win a Championship match this year and were relegated to Division Three of the league.
After losing to Armagh in the first round of the All-Ireland qualifiers, McGrath said his management team would take time to consider their future.
On Wednesday night, Fermanagh revealed their manager was remaining in charge and had received the backing of the county board.
Fermanagh lost to Monaghan in the preliminary round of this year's Ulster Championship, followed by that  qualifier defeat at the Athletic Grounds.
McGrath accepted 2017 had been the worst of his four-year spell as Fermanagh manager.
However, the veteran boss has his backers who believe he has done a creditable job, including taking the Erne county to the All-Ireland quarter-finals two years ago.
