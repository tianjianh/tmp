EFL: Carlisle United's goal drought ended among five things you may have missed

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
April Fools' Day arrived across the EFL, but for some supporters there was absolute no joking around as relegation was finally confirmed for one of the 72 clubs.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
After six months stranded at the foot of the Championship, Rotherham's drop into League One was confirmed by a home defeat to Fulham.
But, the Millers' tale was not the only one of note on a day where promotion prospects and relegation worries were made just a little clearer towards the end of the campaign.
Here are five stories that might have escaped your attention among the twists and turns.
Saturday, 18 February - it might seen like a fairly inconsequential date, but prior to kick-off at Yeovil, for Carlisle United fans, that was the last time they had celebrated a goal.
A wait of 42 days or 701 minutes of football to give it another value, ended when John O'Sullivan's first-half header found the back of the net at Huish Park.
It was a thrilling goal not just for the 170 fans who travelled the 337 miles from Cumbria, but also for United boss Keith Curle.
His side's first league win in eight after Reggie Lambe added a second goal, lifted them back into the League Two play-off places and above fellow contenders Blackpool, who lost at Luton.
There's been no shortage of news coming out of Leyton Orient this season and sadly, not a lot of it has been concerned the club's on-the-pitch fortunes.
Stuck at the foot of League Two and nine points adrift of safety with just six games remaining, this week they parted company with a manager for the fourth time this season.
Danny Webb was the latest man to depart on Thursday after just two months in the job and the managerial baton was passed to his assistant Omer Riza until the end of the campaign.
Riza took charge of the team for the visit of play-off hopefuls Wycombe on Saturday, but there was to be no change in fortune for the hosts.
After defender Tom Parkes was shown a red card inside 28 minutes, Riza failed to keep his cool towards referee Charles Breakspear at the interval.
He was sent to the stands at the start of the second half for verbal abuse and Orient could not prevent a 16th home defeat of a troublesome season as the Chairboys won 2-0.
All of this came amid the club staving off a winding-up petition last month with owner Francesco Becchetti being given until 12 June to pay off debts or sell the club.
From one League Two manager not wanting to watch from the stands to another who was very happy to be able to do so.
Gary Johnson has had more than managing Cheltenham Town on his mind of late after recovering from triple-heart-bypass surgery.
The 61-year-old, who had the operation last month, was back to watch his side, albeit from a less pressurised position than the touchline.
He proved to be somewhat of a lucky charm for his squad and assistant Russell Milton as the Robins ended a run of four straight defeats with a 3-1 win against Morecambe.
It proved a vital three points to help them pull six clear of danger in 21st place.
Maybe he can go and pay Bristol City-managing son Lee a visit in midweek as he fights his own relegation battle in the Championship.
Phil Brown must have found a pretty useful page in his manager's notebook to inspire his Southend side to win against the odds at home to Oldham.
The Shrimpers have surprised a few by being among the League One play-off contenders this season.
But Brown's men showed why they deserve to be there after losing midfielder Ryan Leonard to a red card with 20 minutes to go.
Within eight minutes, the 10-man hosts were 2-0 up courtesy of goals by Nile Ranger and Theo Robinson.
Anthony Wordsworth added a stoppage time penalty to put the gloss on a 3-0 victory for the sixth-placed club, who have now won four league games on the bounce.
There's been lots of talk of late about the resurgence of Jermain Defoe's England career, but one of his goal-scoring 30+ contemporaries showed he still has an eye for a neat finish at Meadow Lane.
Former Newcastle United striker Shola Ameobi, at 35, is a year older than Defoe, and has been plying his trade for Notts County in League Two since the start of February.
He scored his third goal in two games to help Kevin Nolan's side to a 3-1 win against Colchester United.
It was the first time Ameobi had netted a brace in a league game since leading the other Magpies to a famous 5-1 win against Sunderland in October 2010.
The man who scored Newcastle's other three goals that day - none other than Ameobi's then team-mate Kevin Nolan, now his boss at Meadow Lane.
