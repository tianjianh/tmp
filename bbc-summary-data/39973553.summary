The actor was on location in Dumfries and Galloway for several weeks earlier this year, along with fellow stars Peter Mullan and Connor Swindells.
The film, directed by Kristoffer Nyholm, best known for The Killing, was shot at lighthouses across the region.
The picture which has been released shows the three stars with the Mull of Galloway lighthouse as their backdrop.
The psychological thriller sees the region stand in for the remote Flannan Isles in the Outer Hebrides.
The starting point for the film is the true story of the disappearance of three lighthouse keepers more than 100 years ago which has never been properly explained.
Three lighthouses in Dumfries and Galloway - Killantringan, Mull of Galloway and Corsewall - along with Cloch in the Firth of Clyde - were used for filming.
Joe Bone, who co-wrote the screenplay with Celyn Jones, said they could not have hoped for a better backdrop.
