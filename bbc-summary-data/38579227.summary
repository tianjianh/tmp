Newcastle United v Birmingham City

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Newcastle midfielder Jonjo Shelvey is available for the FA Cup third-round replay against Championship rivals Birmingham City after a five-match ban.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
But boss Rafa Benitez is missing Dwight Gayle, Aleksandar Mitrovic, Vurnon Anita and Isaac Hayden through injury.
Birmingham manager Gianfranco Zola says he may rest defender Michael Morrison and striker Lukas Jutkiewicz.
Blues are without new signing Craig Gardner (ineligible), Clayton Donaldson (knee) and Greg Stewart (Achilles).
The teams drew 1-1 in the original tie at St Andrew's, Jutkiewicz's strike cancelling out Daryl Murphy's early opener.
Whoever wins Wednesday's replay will travel to League One side Oxford United in the fourth round on 28 January.

Newcastle manager Rafa Benitez:
"Isaac Hayden is doing well, hopefully not serious. Vurnon Anita has a problem with his ankle, could be six weeks, more or less.
"Dwight Gayle is much better than expected. No time frame, he will be assessed every game. It's too early."
Birmingham manager Gianfranco Zola:
"It's a tough place to go but I will make some changes because we also have a very important game at Blackburn on Saturday.
"I have to try to change some players, especially because we have one or two that have little issues physically and I want to preserve them."
