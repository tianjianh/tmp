[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The probation service was powerless to intervene in the case of a prison leaver who killed a woman in a hostel, an inquest has heard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Matthew Williams killed Cerys Yemm, 22, at the Sirhowy Arms Hotel in Argoed, Caerphilly county, on 6 November 2014.
Williams, 34, also died after being Tasered by police.
Gwent Coroner's Court in Newport heard  Williams had completed his prison sentence so could not be forced to work with the probation service.
Deputy head of public protection, Jonathan Matthews, said: "At the point of the sentence ending, whether we like it or not, we have no power".
Acting on behalf of Williams' family, Nicholas Bowen QC asked Mr Matthews: "You could release someone who could be a ticking time bomb into the community with no power to do anything?"
Mr Matthews said many working in the field "have those concerns" but additional powers would require legislation.
"Part of the difficulty is that statutory oversight will always have to come to an end at some point and that there are budgetary, ethical and civil liberty issues," he said.
The inquest continues.
