[SN]TITLE[SN]
National League clubs to consider six-team play-off at AGM

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A proposal will be put forward to all National League member clubs to change to six-team play-offs at the Annual General Meeting on 10 June.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Currently in non-league's top flight, the four clubs finishing directly below the one automatic promotion place play two-legged semi-finals before a final.
Under the proposals, teams down to seventh in all three of the National League's divisions would be involved.
At the AGM, clubs can vote to amend the proposals, decline them or accept them.
Forest Green won this season's National League promotion final, beating Tranmere Rovers at Wembley 3-1.
FC Halifax Town and Ebbsfleet United won the National League North and South finals respectively, after one-legged semi-final victories.
It is understood that under the proposals all play-off matches will be played over a single leg.
Teams that finish second and third would progress to a semi-final at their home ground, while the teams in fourth and fifth would host seventh and sixth clubs respectively in a "qualifying round".
The winners of those matches would then move into the semi-finals before a final - at Wembley for the National League and a club ground for the North and South divisions.
In theory, that would give teams that finish higher up the division an advantage, as they would play one match less and have a home tie.
