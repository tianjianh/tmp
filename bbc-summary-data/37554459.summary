Rugby couple Simon and Olivia Danielli face court charges

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A high-profile former rugby player and his estranged wife are facing separate court cases involving each other, a broken phone and a damaged Jaguar XF.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Ex-Ulster winger and Scotland winger Simon Danielli, 37, is accused of assaulting his estranged wife, Olivia, and damaging her i-phone.
Meanwhile, the former model and mother-of-three has been charged with damaging Mr Danielli's luxury car.
Both cases have now been adjourned until 18 October.
The Edinburgh-born rugby player faces two counts of common assault against Mrs Danielli, as well as a charge of common assault against Michael Browne on 11 March 2015.
Mr Danielli, of the Coaches, Holywood, was not obliged to attend the brief hearing in Newtownards on Tuesday and detail of the allegations against him were not discussed in open court.
He made 32 appearances for Scotland and 78 for Ulster before retiring in 2012 due to a back injury.
Olivia Danielli, 29, had been due to go on trial for damaging his car on 9 August last year.
However, the case against the former model and mother-of-three was adjourned in September, given the charges against her estranged husband.
Mrs Danielli, from Marino Station Road, Holywood, is the daughter of one of Northern Ireland's wealthiest men, property developer Seamus Jennings who, in 2012, was said to be worth Â£67m.
At one stage, she was also accused of assaulting the 6ft 2in ex-international winger, but that charge was later dropped by the prosecution.
The Public Prosecution Service had initially directed that there would be no case against Mr Danielli, but that decision was reversed.
