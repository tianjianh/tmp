[SN]TITLE[SN]
Cambridge United 1-1 Barnet

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Substitute Alex Nicholls struck eight minutes into his Barnet debut as his new side hit back to draw at Cambridge on the opening day of the League Two season.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Winger Piero Mingoia marked his own debut with Cambridge's goal, stabbing Blair Adams' low cross from the left into the roof of the net after 61 minutes after a quick move that also involved Luke Berry and Harrison Dunk.
Barnet struck back 15 minutes from time, Nicholls cutting inside and firing a fine finish beyond Will Norris after fellow substitute Jean-Louis Akpa Akpro's pass.
In the first half Dunk prodded over after Max Clark's corner fell to him and Joe Pigott blazed over after being fed by James Dunne. Luke Berry powered a free-kick narrowly over, while just before scoring Mingoia hit a swerving effort that also went over.
Barnet's best chances before their goal came through full back Elliott Johnson, whose effort was swept off the line by Tom Dallison, while Leon Legge's fine block denied Akpa Akpro.
