Harry Arter says Bournemouth confident against Arsenal without Jack Wilshere

Harry Arter believes Bournemouth will have no pressure on them when they face Arsenal, even without the services of on-loan midfielder Jack Wilshere.

England international Wilshere, 24, is ineligible for Sunday's Premier League game against his parent club.
But Arter, who made his competitive Republic of Ireland debut earlier this month, is confident Bournemouth can raise their game without him.
"With some hard work and a bit of luck, we can pick something up," he said.
Arter labelled Arsenal the best side Bournemouth faced last season, but following a first Premier League away win of the season for the Cherries at Stoke on Saturday, the 26-year-old says confidence is high.
"I think these kind of clubs [Arsenal] always have the pressure on them," he told BBC Radio Solent. "The fans will be expecting them to beat us.
"If we can stay in the game and get a break, I'm sure it will get a bit nervy at their end and that's when we feel we can hurt them."
Arter and Wilshere have struck up a partnership in Bournemouth's midfield since the latter's arrival on the south coast on a season-long loan to gain more game time and fitness.
His presence on the pitch and the training ground has "lifted the standard" for others, according to the former Woking player.
"He's an unbelievable player," Arter added. "He's probably one of England's most talented players, and one of our most talented players in the squad without a shadow of a doubt.
"I can't pinpoint one thing I've learned from him. But his all-round game can take not just myself, but everyone on to the next level.
"He's getting fitter and that can only be good for England and also ourselves."
