Britain's James DeGale retained his IBF super-middleweight title in Washington DC on Saturday to set up  a potential unification bout with Badou Jack.

DeGale beat Mexico's Rogelio Medina on points in a unanimous decision, with a 115-113 and two 117-111 cards.
Sweden's Jack later successfully defended his WBC title on the same card against Romanian-Canadian Lucian Bute.
Following his second defence of the belt, former Olympic champion DeGale said: "I want Badou Jack."
Londoner DeGale, who extended his winning record to 23-1, was in control for the majority of the 12 rounds but Medina, 27, did enough to stay in the bout.
However, 30-year-old DeGale said he was disappointed to fail in his pre-fight promise of a knockout.
"He's a very tough fighter, he has obviously got a lot stronger and better over the last year and a half," DeGale told Sky Sports.
"I should be taking out people like Medina, that's no disrespect to him. But I'm still learning.
"But the main thing is I am still champ. I've got to work on things still."
DeGale has previously said he will also give unbeaten Liverpool's Callum Smith, who stopped Hadillah Mohoumadi inside one round earlier this month, a shot at the title.
