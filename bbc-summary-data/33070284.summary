Gynaecologist Rob Jones: Hundreds of women in legal claim

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Two hundred women treated by a disgraced surgeon have joined a group taking legal action against the Royal Cornwall Hospitals Trust.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Rob Jones worked as an obstetrician and gynaecologist in Cornwall for 20 years and continued to practice despite eight reviews into his work.
Lawyers believe about 1,000 women may be entitled to damages and at least three law firms are working on cases.
The trust said it "apologised unreservedly" to its patients.
In 2010, he delivered Prime Minister David Cameron's youngest child Florence by Caesarean section.
Mr Jones was finally suspended from his role in May 2012, before retiring and voluntarily taking his name off the medical register.
Two years ago lawyers revealed that 130 of his patients had lodged complaints against him.
He declined to comment on the news that hundreds of women were now taking legal action against the trust.
Mike Bird, one of the lawyers involved in the group action, said: "There are people who have been through very difficult issues with their health, a lot of bladder or bowel problems, for example.
"Some women may not want to relive those experiences. They may not even have told their families about the full extent of their problems.
Mr Bird stressed the deadline for former patients of Mr Jones to register their complaints was November.
"It stands to reason that they may be reluctant to come forward and talk to other people about them now," he said.
"If they know it's there and decide not to use it, that's absolutely fine. But because there is a deadline, we don't want people to miss that through not knowing about it."
ROB JONES TIMELINE
In a statement, the Royal Cornwall Hospitals Trust said it "apologised unreservedly to all the women affected and their families for the pain, distress and anxiety caused by the practice" of Mr Jones.
"We have implemented the recommendations from the independent reports published in February 2013 and have supported women through any follow-up review or subsequent care.
"We have also worked openly with the NHS Litigation Authority and solicitors to settle claims as quickly as possible."
The trust has a free information line available for women who want to speak to them about care received from Mr Jones. The number is 0800 180 4514.
Mother-of-three Claire Hill, who was left incontinent for two years after a botched operation by Mr Jones, was awarded an unspecified amount of damages earlier this year for the surgery.
Mrs Hill, 37, from Tywardreath, near Fowey in Cornwall, was found to have a fistula, or hole, near her bladder, which was not diagnosed by Mr Jones during the operation in 2011.
The cause of her incontinence was not discovered until she saw a different surgeon five months later about another matter.
