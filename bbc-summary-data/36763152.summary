The teenager was attacked on Thursday night at the festival campsite at Strathallan Castle.
A Police Scotland spokeswoman said inquiries into the incident were ongoing.
The separate deaths of a male and female, both aged 17, at the festival on campsite on Friday, are also being investigated.
Police Scotland said 429 crimes were reported at the festival, compared with 414 last year.
Officers made 54 arrests, compared with 57 in 2015.
Supt Conrad Trickett said: "Obviously the deaths of two young people on Thursday evening was an awful tragedy and our hearts go out to their families.
"However, in general, this was a good-natured event with festival goers well behaved and enjoying themselves.
"We are pleased to see the reduction in serious assaults and thefts while a robust approach by the event organisers and ourselves in tackling anyone trying to bring drugs into the festival has brought a welcome increase in the number of seizures."
Medical teams said 541 people attended the festival's hospital tent, with 27 people being sent to hospital.
Nick Moore from the Scottish Ambulance Service said: "The audience has given us no real cause for concern.
"We've seen a slightly lower stream of people over the weekend, mainly for minor issues."
