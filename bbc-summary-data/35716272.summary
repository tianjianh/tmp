[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Team Sky riders have won the eight-day race in three of the past four years - Bradley Wiggins' 2012 win followed by Richie Porte's 2013 and 2015 victories.
Thomas will be hoping for his second consecutive victory after retaining his Volta ao Algarve title in February.
He will be joined by Wales' Luke Rowe plus Ian Stannard, Ben Swift and world time trial champion Vasil Kiryienka.
Ian Boswell, Sergio Henao, Mikel Nieve and Nicolas Roche make up the rest of the squad.
Defending champion Porte will be riding for the American BMC Racing Team, while Tinkoff's Alberto Contador will also hope to be in contention.
Thomas' Team Sky colleagues Peter Kennaugh and Michal Kwiatkowski will instead ride Saturday's Strade Bianche race in Tuscany, then the Tirreno-Adriatico stage race across central Italy from 9-15 March.
Team Sky squad for Paris-Nice: Ian Boswell, Sergio Henao, Mikel Nieve, Nicolas Roche, Luke Rowe, Ian Stannard, Ben Swift, Geraint Thomas.
