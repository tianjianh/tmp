The hosts led 2-0 after Ellen White's opener and Jess Clarke's curler.
Liverpool's Caroline Weir then placed a penalty over the bar and White punished that miss with Notts' third goal.
Katie Zelem pulled one back for Liverpool from the spot after Amy Turner fouled Emma Lundh in the area and Zelem fired in her second to give the Reds hope but Notts held on to win.
Victory lifted Rick Passmoor's side up to fourth, above Liverpool on goal difference.
Both sides are three points behind third-placed Arsenal.

Notts County striker Ellen White: "We're delighted to get the three points, we've been yearning for that first league win.
"We played some really nice stuff and got some good goals, especially the one Jess scored - it was an absolute screamer.
"But it was disappointing for us not to keep a clean sheet. Those last few minutes must have been exiting for the spectators, but not for us.
"If you take away those two late goals we conceded though, it was a great team performance."
Liverpool captain Gemma Bonner: "We're very disappointed. We started the game well and created a couple of good chances, but in the end we gave ourselves too much to do.
"Going three goals behind meant we had a mountain to climb, but we can take some positives from the last 15 minutes when we pulled two goals back.
"We lost to Chelsea at home last week, but we performed really well and even their manager said we deserved a draw. So we'll go down there next week knowing that we can compete with them, and we'll hopefully come back with three points."
