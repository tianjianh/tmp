A trailer for Jeremy Clarkson's final episode of Top Gear has been released by the BBC.

The episode will feature two films shot before Clarkson was suspended from Top Gear and eventually sacked.
Co-presenter Richard Hammond and James May return to present links from the studio, with Clarkson noticeably absent.
No date has been given for transmission, and the BBC has yet to decide how Top Gear may return.
The show was pulled from the schedules after Clarkson's suspension for attacking a producer earlier this year.
Footage shot for the three remaining episodes has now been compiled in to one extended programme.
It contains two films which, in classic Top Gear style, feature cheap bangers, caravans and a race to the finish line for the three presenters to avoid a forfeit.
Earlier this week, rumours circulated that Chris Evans was being groomed to take over the Top Gear hotseat from Clarkson, after the Radio 2 DJ reaveled he was making a "Top Gear sequence".
It later emerged that the film was part of Evans one-off edition of TFI Friday, in which his friend Clarkson will appear.
Evans has ruled himself out of the Top Gear job on a number of occasions.
There has also been speculation that the show could return with a different guest host every week, in a similar style to BBC One's satirical quiz show Have I Got News For You.
It was reported last week Hammond and May had been offered Â£1m deals to stay with the BBC, although they themselves have seemed to distance themselves from returning.
The Top Gear trio have been appearing together in a series of live shows, which were originally meant to be under the Top Gear banner, but have since been rebranded Clarkson, Hammond and May Live and stripped of all BBC branding.
