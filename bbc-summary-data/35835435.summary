United were knocked out of the Europa League by Liverpool and next face City, who are four points ahead of them in fourth place in the Premier League.
"We have to beat City because that is the other chance to qualify for the Champions League," said Van Gaal.
"The expectations are always high. We know that and we can cope with that."
The winners of the Europa League automatically earn a place in the Champions League, a route which could see Liverpool back in the competition next year after they comfortably saw off United over the two legs.
United must now finish in the top four - a task that would be made all the more difficult by defeat at the hands of City at the Etihad on Sunday.
Van Gaal's side are also still to face second-placed Tottenham, and West Ham - two points above United in fifth - in their final nine games.
"I am not angry, I am not frustrated," said Van Gaal. "We have created a lot of chances but they scored the away goal. That was the difference.
"I hope City on Sunday will be the catalyst. We shall do everything that we did today."
