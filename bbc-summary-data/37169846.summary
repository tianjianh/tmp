Seals say goodbye in County Down after beach release

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
After seven weeks of care and close contact, it can be hard to say goodbye.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
That is what happened when seal biologist Sue Wilson attempted to release two abandoned seal pups back into the wild.
One took off without a backward glance. But the other, called Coral, was reluctant to leave someone who had fed and cared for her for weeks.
The pups were rescued when they were found back in June seriously underweight.
They had been unable to follow their mothers in the sea and had become stranded.
Ms Wilson runs a research project on mother and pup behaviour.
She took them in and fed them on a special supplement, crushed fish and cream.
She took them back to the beach at Minerstown, County Down, where they had been found, to be released.
It took around an hour for Coral to leave, finally drawn away by the presence of adult seals.
Ms Wilson has helped more than 20 pups back to the sea over the years.
