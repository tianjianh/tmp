Northern Ireland has voted to remain in the EU Referendum by a majority of 56% to 44%.

However, the UK, as a whole, has voted by a narrow margin to leave the EU.
Following the result, Prime Minster David Cameron said he would continue for three more months in post, then step down by October.
It is up to a new prime minister to start the formal and legal process of leaving the EU, he said.
EU Referendum results
In Northern Ireland, First Minister Arlene Foster said; "I think this a good result for the United Kingdom. Our nation state has made a clear definition as to where they want to go forward."
"They backed hope, they backed aspiration, they backed the future potential of the United Kingdom and I'm very pleased with the result."
But Martin McGuinness, Sinn Féin, said the entire island of Ireland should now be able to vote on reunification.
He said there was "a democratic imperative" for a border poll.  Mr Cameron had been "sleepwalking towards an exit" over the last year, he said.
He accused him of "kow-towing" to the right-wing agenda and the "little Englander mentality". But, he said, the people of Northern Ireland, both nationalist and unionist, had voted against that.
The deputy first minister said the impact in Northern Ireland would be "very profound".
In a statement, the Irish government said the result had "very significant implications for Ireland, as well as for Britain and for the European Union".
It will meet later on Friday morning and the Irish taoiseach (prime minister) Enda Kenny will then speak.
Micheál Martin, leader of the Republic's main opposition party, Fianna Fáil, called on the Irish government to be centrally involved in the UK's divorce negotiations to minimise the repercussions and to make clear, that despite the historic close links and trade relationships between the two states, Ireland will not be following the British example.
Overall, 440,707 people in Northern Ireland voted to Remain in the EU and 349,442 to Leave. Out of 18 constituencies, 11 voted to stay in the European Union.
The turnout in Northern Ireland was 62.7% with 790,523 people voting in the referendum.
The EU referendum debate divided the parties in Northern Ireland and the result to leave means there are conflicting thoughts on what should happen next.
The DUP backed a Leave vote and the idea of holding a referendum was a long-term ambition of the party's Westminster leader Nigel Dodds.  First Minister Arlene Foster will be delighted with the result.
The Remain camp included Sinn Féin, the UUP, the SDLP and the Alliance Party and they will highlight the fact that a majority of voters in Northern Ireland bucked the trend, rejecting the arguments for a Brexit.
Sinn Féin have called again for a border poll. The party believes the result means there is now a democratic deficit because the rest of the UK is at odds over the issue of Europe.
For Secretary of State, Theresa Villiers, there will be much personal satisfaction with the result. She was a key member of the Leave campaign and although she finds herself in tune with public opinion in the rest of the UK, she will be conscious that her stance is at odds with the majority of people in Northern Ireland.
Speaking after the result was announced, Edwin Poots, DUP, said he was "absolutely delighted".
"I believe that we will recover very quickly after the initial shock.  The farming community has been in the doldrums... I would expect this will help them. I would expect it will help our manufacturers and our exporters at this time."
At one level nothing has changed. But in reality everything has changed.
Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK are, for now, still in the EU and its single market: companies still trade under the same system as they did on Thursday.
But that arrangement will now have to end which could have far reaching economic consequences.

He said there was now £10bn that was going to the EU that can now be distributed throughout the UK.
However, Declan Kearney, Sinn Féin, called it "a pyrrhic victory".
"The reality is that the people of the north of Ireland overwhelmingly voted in favour of Remain - both republican and unionist, Catholic and Protestant and those of no faith background," he said.
"We now have a situation where English votes are going to drag the will of the people of the north of Ireland to remain within the EU, out of the EU. That is a huge democratic deficit.
The result of the referendum means significant changes for farming here. But not immediately.
The focus now will be on the negotiations for leaving the EU, expected to take at least two years, and what domestic arrangements are arrived at to support agriculture.

In Northern Ireland, Foyle, West Tyrone, Belfast North, Belfast South, Belfast West, East Londonderry, Fermanagh and South Tyrone, Newry and Armagh, Mid-Ulster, North Down and South Down voted in favour of Remain.
Lagan Valley, North Antrim, East Antrim, South Antrim, Strangford, Belfast East and Upper Bann voted to Leave.
It is clear this is not the outcome the Republic of Ireland wanted.
The Irish government, which remained neutral in the Scottish independence referendum, actively encouraged Irish citizens in the UK to vote to remain in the EU.
