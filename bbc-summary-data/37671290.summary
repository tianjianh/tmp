Hundreds of new jobs are to be created by upmarket snack firm Tyrrells following its takeover by a US firm, its managing director has said.

The Herefordshire-based maker of hand-cooked crisps was bought by Amplify Snack Brands for £300m.
Mike Hedges said the move would see hundreds of people recruited globally over the next three years.
He said he did not think the UK leaving the EU would adversely affect business at the company.
"In 2008, during the last recession, none of the premium crisp brands suffered and I don't think they will this time either - if there is a downturn," said Mr Hedges.
"We have no business in North America and Amplify has no business over here," he said.
"They're going to take the Tyrrells brand and roll it out in North America and we'll take their SkinnyPop brand, and others, and do the same in the UK.
"We'll have to take on more staff to do that and I'd say that, over the next three years, we'll recruit hundreds globally."
Tyrrells employs more than 300 people in the UK.
In August last year it acquired Australian firm Yarra Valley Snack Foods, and earlier this year bought Germany-based Aroma Snacks.
The company was founded in 2002 by potato farmer William Chase  who realised that making crisps was more profitable than selling potatoes to supermarkets.
Mr Chase sold the Leominster company in 2008 for nearly £40m and used some of the the proceeds from the sale to set up a distillery making premium vodka and gin.
