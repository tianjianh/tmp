Kidderminster Harriers kept alive their slim hopes of National League survival as Ben Whitfield's goal earned victory over fellow strugglers Halifax Town.

Harriers will still need to win all three of their remaining games and hope results go their way to avoid the drop.
Whitfield slotted in the winner early in the second half after being teed up by Lewis Kinsella.
The hosts could even afford to miss a penalty as Elton Ngwatala's spot-kick was saved by Sam Johnson.
Kidderminster's second win in four days lifts them off the bottom of the table, above Welling, but they are eight points behind 20th-placed Halifax, who are two points clear of the relegation zone.
Harriers boss Colin Gordon told BBC Hereford & Worcester:
"I'm delighted with the result and, in parts, very pleased with the performance.
"Two wins in a row is lovely. We're on a good run. I just wish we'd had this team to have a pre-season with as we'd be nowhere near where we are in the league now.
"We're a very fit, strong and powerful team so we knew that chances would come, but we had to be brave to pass the ball to create those chances."
