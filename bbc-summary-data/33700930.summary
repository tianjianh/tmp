Norman Lamb, who was defeated by Mr Farron in the leadership contest, takes the health brief.
Baroness Kramer, a member of the Lords, will speak on economic matters, while Tom Brake MP will be the chief whip and take charge of foreign affairs.
Mr Farron said the "excellent" team would lead the "Lib Dem fight back".
The former party president was elected as the new leader of the Liberal Democrats on 16 July, beating Mr Lamb with 56.5% of the votes cast.
The contest was sparked by Mr Clegg's resignation after the party's near wipe-out at the general election, which saw the Lib Dems reduced to just eight MPs.
Here is the full list of spokespeople appointed by Mr Farron:
In a statement, the Lib Dem leader said the new team "is the Liberal voice that Britain desperately needs".
"It features some of the best campaigners that the party has, balanced with the experience and economic credibility that our party has developed over the last five years in government.
"It was important to me to be able to call on the advice and experience of people at all levels of our party and I believe we have an excellent team to lead the Lib Dem fight back.
"Together, we will take our ideas, our values and our liberal messages to every corner of Britain. We will make the case for housing, immigration, Europe, environmentalism and human rights," he added.
