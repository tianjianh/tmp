The 23-year-old beat Sweden's Nikita Glasnovic in the -57kg final to claim gold in Switzerland on Friday.
"I'm absolutely over the moon. The road to Rio has been harder than it was for London, so to tick that off my list and be European champion, I feel on top of the world," Jones told BBC Sport.
"Rio is going to be really hard, but I believe on my day I can win."

Jones won 11-5 in a one-sided final to take gold having previously earned two bronze medals and one silver in the continental event.
A quick start gave the Welsh athlete a three-point advantage and a trademark head shot early in the second doubled her lead and effectively sealed the contest against one of her chief rivals for the Olympic crown.
Bianca Walkden and Mahama Cho have also secured their places at this summer's Olympic Games. The final place will go to either Lutalo Muhammad and Damon Sansum.
