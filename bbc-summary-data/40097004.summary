The rest of the tickets will raise money for the "We Love Manchester Emergency Fund", set up by Manchester City Council with the British Red Cross.
Ariana previously said in an open letter on social media that she'd return to Manchester for a benefit concert.
She wrote: "We won't let hate winâ€¦ Our response to this violence must be to come closer together, to help each other, to love more, to sing louder and to live more kindly and generously than we did before.
"Music is meant to heal us, to bring us together, to make us happy. So that is what it will continue to do for us. We will continue to honour the ones we lost, their loved ones, my fans and all affected by this tragedy."
