Shrewsbury Town: Junior Brown and Callum Burton agree new contracts

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Defender Junior Brown and former England youth goalkeeper Callum Burton have signed new contracts with League One club Shrewsbury Town.

Originally arriving as a winger a year ago, Brown, 27, was converted to left-back at Town, before his season was ended in April by a knee injury.
Burton, 19, made his first-team debut in the final game of last term, a 3-0 defeat by Swindon Town.
The club have not revealed the length of the players' new deals.
Brown, who made 40 appearances before his injury, will compete for the left-back spot next season with Mat Sadler and new arrival Ryan McGivern - one of six new signings made by boss Micky Mellon so far this summer.
Shrewsbury finished one place, but four points, above the relegation zone in League One in 2015-16.
