Asta's Glam Factory, on Castlereagh Street, is owned by a Lithuanian woman.
Police received a report that a gang of men forced up the shutters shortly before midnight, poured accelerant on the premises and set it alight.
It follows a series of recent attacks on foreign nationals in Belfast.
Three fire crews were called to deal with the fire at the nail salon and the blaze was extinguished by 01:00 BST.
Police said no-one was in the salon at the time but the building has been extensively damaged by fire and smoke.
Det Insp Jenna Fitzpatrick said police believed that the gang may have fled the scene in a black 4 x 4 vehicle.
She appealed for anyone who had information about the attack to contact officers on the non-emergency number 101.
On Sunday, Northern Ireland's Honorary Polish Consul Jerome Mullen called on Stormont's first and deputy first ministers to take action after a series of racially-motivated attacks on Polish homes in north Belfast.
