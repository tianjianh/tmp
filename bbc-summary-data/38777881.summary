The 23-year-old returns to his home town to play for the Stones, having scored once in 17 appearances for his parent club this season.
Pigott joined Cambridge from Charlton in July after several loan spells, notably at Luton and Southend - whom he helped to gain promotion in 2014-15.
"I'm a bit relieved to get it over the line," Pigott told the club website.
"It's been in the pipeline for a few weeks."
