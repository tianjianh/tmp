Ola John: Brian McDermott the perfect tutor for Reading wing role

Reading's Ola John says manager Brian McDermott is helping him get the balance right between defence and attack.

The 23-year-old scored his second Royals goal in the club's last-gasp 4-3 win over Charlton last Saturday.
The on-loan Benfica midfielder has started the last two Reading matches under McDermott, himself an ex-winger.
"You have to do both and you cannot just attack. He talks a lot to me which gives me confidence," said John.
"He tries to bring the best out of me. He always talks about himself and that he was a winger.
"He gives me a lot of freedom to attack but he talks a lot about defending," he told BBC Radio Berkshire.
John, who spent time on loan in Germany's Bundesliga with Hamburg last term, confirmed he was enjoying life in the Championship.
And the Dutchman, who has only 12 months to run on his current contract with parent club Benfica, is not ruling out a full-time move to England.
"I am happy here and now I am playing," added John. "I have to see what the options are in the summer.
"Reading is a nice club. I think we have a great team and some great players."
