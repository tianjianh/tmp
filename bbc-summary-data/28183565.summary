Designed by textile artist Jilli Blackwood, the uniform includes turquoise, fuchsia and navy tartan.
Hundreds of Team Scotland athletes were in Stirling for the final Team Camp when the outfits were revealed.
The men's uniform comprises a blue shirt while a flowing wrap-around dress has been designed for the women.
A shawl-like wrap and stone-coloured leather bag complete the women's uniform, the latter worn diagonally across the front like one half of the St Andrew's Cross.
The flag-inspired theme continues with a ripple-like pattern through both the shirt and dress.
Ms Blackwood, a graduate of the Glasgow School of Art and a native of the city, said: "My brief from Team Scotland was to come up with a parade uniform that was high on impact and made a real statement, but also had a contemporary feel.
"There will be no mistaking that this is the Scottish team as they proudly step out at the opening ceremony."
The outfits were produced by House of Edgar from Keith in Aberdeenshire.
Cyclist Charline Joiner, who helped model the new uniform, said: "It's refreshing and a definite surprise. I was expecting a kilt, but love the fact the girls are in dresses this time as it's more feminine and it's still got the blue of Scotland in it."
Commonwealth Games Scotland chief executive and Team Scotland chef de mission, Jon Doig, said: "We wanted a parade uniform that had a bold and confident look, but which still retained the iconic Scottish elements of the kilt and unique Games tartan."
Afterwards the athletes were each given a kit bag containing garments to be worn during the games themselves.
The bags contained sports specific clothing, either blue or white, emblazoned with the Team Scotland logo.
