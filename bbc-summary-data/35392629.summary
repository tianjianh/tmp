PwC did not disclose how much it paid for Praxism, which specialises in identity and access management (IDaM).
Praxism's founder and director, Derek Gordon, and 13 employees will join PwC's Edinburgh office, with one specialist located in Leeds.
Praxism works across a range of industries including healthcare, education and financial services.
Colin Slater, digital and cyber partner for PwC in Scotland, said: "Over the last six years, we've built a market-leading cyber security business and this acquisition provides a catalyst from which to expand our operations and build on our position as a trusted partner to solve complex identity and access problems.
"The acquisition will also significantly expand our cyber security team in Scotland, with a particular focus on our key markets including utilities, financial services, energy and public sector."
