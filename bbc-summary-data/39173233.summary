Russell Slade: Coventry City sack manager after 16 games in charge

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Russell Slade has been sacked as manager of Coventry City, who are bottom of the League One table.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 56-year-old only won three of his 16 games in charge of the Sky Blues following his appointment on 21 December.
Coventry are 13 points adrift of safety in the third tier following Saturday's 0-0 draw at Shrewsbury.
However, the club have reached the final of the EFL Trophy where they will play Oxford at Wembley on 2 April.
Coventry picked up seven points from a possible 39 on offer in the league after former Leyton Orient, Cardiff and Charlton boss Slade took charge.
A short statement on the Coventry website confirmed the club had parted company with Slade, and that they aim to "make a replacement appointment imminently".
The Sky Blues spent 34 years in the top flight between 1967 and 2001 but are likely to drop into the fourth tier for the first time since 1958-59.
Coventry are now looking for their ninth manager at the Ricoh Arena inside six years - and their fourth this season.
Tony Mowbray started the campaign in charge but resigned on 29 September and technical director Mark Venus had a 12-game spell as interim boss before Slade was appointed on 21 December.
Slade was City's 10th manager since owners Sisu (now registered as Otium) took over the club in 2007.
