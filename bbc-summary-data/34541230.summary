Planners recommend rejecting QUB plan

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Planners have recommended that a controversial student housing plan for the Malone Road area of south Belfast should not go ahead.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Queen's University wanted to create 102 student rooms at Lennoxvale through a mixture of new building and renovation.
Residents in the adjacent Sans Souci Park had campaigned against the plan.
The planning report said it would harm the character of Malone Conservation Area through inappropriate scale, massing and layout.
A second ground for refusal was that the development failed to respect the landscape features of the site and would harm protected trees.
A spokesperson for Queen's University said the development would have represented an investment of Â£7m and would mainly have been aimed at international students.
The planners said that while the proposal was "noteworthy" in terms of capital investment, it was not considered that outweighed the damage that would be caused if it was permitted.
The application is due to be decided by Belfast City Council planning committee next week.
