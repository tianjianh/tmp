The 29-year-old was hurt in the British and Irish Cup tie with London Irish at the Mennaye in December.
He initially had surgery on the problem, but needs more to help it.
"We'll be able to gauge a timeframe from that, but he'll be returning to play at some point next season," Cattle told BBC Radio Cornwall.
"I don't want to speculate too much on it," added Cattle of Evans, who has scored four tries in eight Championship games this season and crossed the whitewash against Ireland in November.
"I know a lot of people want to know what's going on with Matt because he's a very popular member of our squad and been a star for us on and off the pitch."
In his 38 caps for Canada, Evans has scored 10 tries and played at the last two World Cups.
