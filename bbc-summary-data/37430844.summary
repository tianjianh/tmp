At least 13 people have been killed and more than 15 people are missing after a ferry sank in the southern Barisal district of Bangladesh.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Local people said the ferry was overcrowded when part of the riverbank it was anchored alongside gave way and a huge slab of mud fell on to the boat.
Some people managed to swim to shore.
Ferry accidents are fairly common on Bangladesh's vast river network. Strict regulations have been put in place to try to prevent such disasters.
"So far we have recovered 13 bodies including three women and a child," Barisal police chief Mohammad Akhteruzzaman told the AFP news agency.
He said divers had located the sunken ferry and would be bringing it in to shore.
"Another salvage vessel is coming to the scene to help the rescue effort."
