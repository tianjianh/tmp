A march has taken place in Kirkcaldy in memory of a man who died in police custody following an incident in the town earlier this year.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Sheku Bayoh, 31, died after being detained by officers on 3 May.
An inquiry into what happened is being conducted by the Police Investigations and Review Commissioner (Pirc).
Mr Bayoh's partner Collette Bell, sister and brother-in-law, as well as the family's lawyer, made speeches ahead of the march.
His relatives are due to to meet Police Scotland Chief Constable Stephen House on Monday.
Hundreds of people gathered in Kirkcaldy for the event on Sunday afternoon.
Family solicitor Aamer Anwar said the support showed that their campaign for justice was not going away.
Mr Bayoh's family have previously questioned the independence of the Pirc probe.
On Thursday, at a meeting with commissioner Kate Framer, they were told they would be allowed to help select additional experts to aid the investigation.
Speaking at the march, Mr Bayoh's brother-law-in Adie Johnson said: "We are here today to try to create more awareness of the situation we are in, in terms of Sheku's death.
"We are finding the processes and procedures very, very challenging at the moment. It is very tough on families to go through something like this."
Referring to the meeting with the chief constable, Mr Anwar said: "I would hope that the meeting will be positive, I expect it to be a very robust one.
"The family do welcome the fact that the Chief Constable, despite announcing his resignation, has had the courage to say that he will meet the family.
"It's an important step forward and the family want the chief constable to see what they have been through and to raise concerns."
The Pirc said that all lines of inquiry are being explored to establish the circumstances of Mr Bayoh's death.
Police Scotland said they await the conclusion of the Pirc investigation and remain committed to co-operating fully with the body's inquiries.
Mr Bayoh's family met Lord Advocate Frank Mulholland in Edinburgh last month to discuss the case.
