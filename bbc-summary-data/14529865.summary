Marc Williamson, 21, from the Richhill area, was stabbed in Hartfield Avenue on Sunday morning.
His parents, Barbara and Cecil Williamson, were speaking after seeing their son's body in a morgue.
Three men, aged 28, 26 and 24, have been arrested in connection with the murder.
Police have been granted an extra 36 hours to question the 26-year-old and the others remain in custody.
Mr and Mrs Williamson said the impact of their son's killing was "unbearable" and described it as "senseless".
They made a general appeal for people to stop carrying knives.
"A camera should be down in that morgue to let people that use knives see what they have done," Barbara Williamson said.
"Marc has a wee girl who is seven months old and he loved that child, she was his pride and joy.
"He will never get to see her growing up.
"I wouldn't like any other parent to see what we have gone through.
"We don't know what our future is going to be now. I have three other sons and they are devastated."
The couple said they sympathised with the parents of their son's killers and said they held no anger towards them.
"I am sure they are sitting there devastated today as well," Mrs Williamson added.
