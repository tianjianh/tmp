The company, which has faced criticism from many, including the Church of England, over its interest charges, said demand for its loans had soared.
In its annual statement, Wonga reported £1.2bn in lending, an increase of 68%.
Wonga has also opened a business lending arm, and expanded abroad.
So called "payday loan" firms, which often lend to those who cannot get a loan from a High Street bank, are currently the subject of a Competition Commission review.
It is estimated the sector has two million customers with loans worth £2bn.
Wonga typically charges interest rates of 1% a day, with a £5.50 charge, for loans of up to £1,000.
In a statement, Errol Damelin, Wonga founder and chief executive, said that discussions over the company's practices were welcome, and that recent criticisms from the Archbishop of Canterbury earlier this year had, "encouraged a discussion around who our customers are and why they use us".
Mr Damelin added: "Access to practical and affordable sources of credit is a big issue for our society and Wonga is playing a part by lending responsibly, and at scale, to people who can generally afford to pay us back quickly".
