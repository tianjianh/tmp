Negotiations are taking place to allow squatters who have been using a former car showroom as a homeless shelter to stay temporarily.

Campaigners say the former Volkswagen garage - owned by Wadham College - is "Oxford's unofficial homeless shelter".
Leaseholder Midcounties Co-operative said it was "very confident" it could reach an agreement.
It is trying to agree a deal that would allow the squatters to remain until April when its lease ends.
Kevin Brown, group general manager at The Midcounties Co-operative, said: "In April we have a legal obligation to hand the site back, with vacant possession, to our landlord Wadham College.
"To ensure we're able to meet that requirement, we will request a repossession order but our preference is not to use it."
Campaigners have asked for the site to be officially designated as homeless housing.
However, Wadham College hopes to redevelop the building into student accommodation.
Lewis Cairns, who is homeless and has been living in the squat, said: "It's a bit of a godsend really, I feel like I can get somewhere now.
"I can start applying for university and get things done."
Last week, Wadham College said it was "exploring everything" and had not decided whether to take legal action.
It added its primary focus was the "safety implications" for the homeless who had moved in and said it had a longstanding relationship with the Gatehouse homeless project.
A statement said: "The college will be making every effort to speak to representatives of this homeless group as well as local residents, safety experts and the site developers."
