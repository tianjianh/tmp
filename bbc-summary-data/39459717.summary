Celtic boss Brendan Rodgers has revealed his delight at the strides made by Moussa Dembele this season.

The 20-year-old Frenchman joined Celtic from Fulham in the summer, with his 32-goal haul ensuring he is now one of Europe's most sought-after strikers.
And Rodgers insists Dembele has benefited massively from making the switch to Scotland's top-flight.
"He's developed very well and met the challenge to play for a big club, feel pressure and win trophies," he said.
"He wants to improve and that's the type of player you want to work with."
Dembele cost Celtic a development fee of just Â£500,000 but his value has rocketed after a stunning debut season.
Rodgers concedes that the striker will leave the club one day but expects a lot more from him before that time comes.
"I think we all know at some point he will move on, it's just about timing," Rodgers told BBC Sport.
"But I know at this point he's very happy here. He's only 20 and he's been a joy to work with.
"There's no doubt there will be a natural point in time that he goes, I think we all understand that. Unfortunately, that's how it goes up here. But if he serves the club well in his time here that's all we can ask for."

Celtic will win the Premiership title if they beat Hearts at Tynecastle on Sunday.
They are unbeaten in the league this season, have already won the League Cup and are in the semi-final of the Scottish Cup.
Rodgers described the club's unbeaten run as "incredible" but knows his side have a lot to do to go through the whole campaign without suffering a loss.
"I think the unbeaten one is very difficult," he said. "We have nine games to go and the last five games you go into a split. The last five are against top six teams so it becomes really difficult.
"In terms of the treble, we never really mention it. We have to stabilise that emotion and just think about performing and playing well.
"We want to win every game we play. For the remainder of season we will push as hard as we have all season - I think the group is getting better as they play more together."
