Scottish League Cup final: Goalkeeper Konopka joins Ross County

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Ross County have signed former Toronto goalkeeper Chris Konopka on a short-term contract as cover ahead of Sunday's Scottish League Cup final.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
First choice Scott Fox is facing at least two months on the sidelines with knee ligament damage.
Gary Woods has been deputising, but 30-year-old Konopka could find himself in the squad to face Hibernian.
The deal is subject to international clearance, but a work permit is not required as he has a Polish passport.
New Jersey-born Konopka was released at the end of last season by Major League Soccer club Toronto having played only 22 times since joining from Philadelphia Union in 2013.
He has previous experience of European football having joined Sporting Fingal in the Republic of Ireland after starting his career with Jersey Falcons then Kansas City Wizards.
Konopka also played for Waterford United before returning to the United States with New York Red Bulls.
He recently had a trial with DC United in Florida.
Now he will vie with Woods, who is on loan from Leyton Orient, for a starting place at Hampden Park on Sunday.
