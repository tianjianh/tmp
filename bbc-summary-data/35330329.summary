Viewers saw Peggy make a surprise return on Friday night when she told her son Phil her cancer had returned.
Dame Barbara, 78, said she had thought "long and hard about it" but it was now time to say goodbye to the character.
She joined the soap in 1994 and played the character full-time until 2010. She has since made occasional returns.
Unlike her previous storyline, she will not win her cancer battle and will die from the disease.
"Peggy is a character close to my heart but I made the decision a while ago that I need to say goodbye to her once and for all, as otherwise she will always be there, urging me to go back, and that is something I need to shut the door on," Dame Barbara said.
She said EastEnders executive producer Dominic Treadwell-Collins had accepted her decision and they had been "secretly plotting Peggy's last scenes" since the summer.
The scenes were filmed secretly in November, and will air in the late spring of 2016, said a blog posted on the official EastEnders website.
Dame Barbara said she wanted the role to end while Mr Treadwell-Collins was still working on the programme.
"After thinking long and hard about it, I realised that it is time for me and the audience to say our final farewells to the lady who I have loved for many years and I thought that whilst the guvnor, who I adore, is still in charge I want him to be the one to oversee it," she added.
Born in east London, Dame Barbara made her West End stage debut at the age of 15 after training in drama and dance. In the 1960s and 1970s she appeared in a series of TV sitcoms and the Carry On... comedy films, before becoming a household name to a new generation of TV viewers through EastEnders.

Treadwell-Collins said: "Barbara is the real guvnor of EastEnders. So when she told me her decision back in the summer, we both had a little cry before getting excited about how Peggy Mitchell, the matriarch to end all matriarchs, could bid her final farewell to Albert Square."
He praised the actress, who was made a dame in the Queen's New Year Honours list for services to charity and entertainment, for creating one of the "greatest ever characters on British television" and said her exit was the end of an EastEnders era.
He added that Peggy's departure would be "one of the most heartbreaking, uplifting and epic exits an EastEnders character has ever had".
As the Mitchell family matriarch, Peggy's biggest storylines have included her battle with breast cancer, her marriage to Frank Butcher, her feud and friendship with Pat Butcher and her marriage to Archie Mitchell, which resulted in the family losing The Queen Vic pub.
