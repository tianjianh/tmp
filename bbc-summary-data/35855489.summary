Josh Cotton, who lived on the narrow boat The Spirit at Sawley Marina, was last seen on 11 March.
More than 100 boat owners live on the site on the River Trent, which is largest inland marina in the UK.
Leicestershire Police have carried out searches but say they want all boat owners are aware of his disappearance.
Police divers have already searched the water around Mr Cotton's boat and a police helicopter has carried out searches of the area around the marina using thermal imaging cameras.
Sgt James Cross, of Leicestershire Police, said: "We want to make Josh's face well known, not only to the boating community but also to the wider public."
