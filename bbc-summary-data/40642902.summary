Giuseppe Bellusci: Leeds United defender leaves Elland Road

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Leeds United have terminated the contract of defender Giuseppe Bellusci.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Bellusci, 27, leaves Elland Road by mutual consent after making 61 appearances over three years.
The Italian centre-back was one of former Leeds owner Massimo Cellino's first signings when he penned a four-year deal in August 2014.
However, he spent last season on loan at Empoli and departs after being left out of the pre-season tour of Austria by head coach Thomas Christiansen.
