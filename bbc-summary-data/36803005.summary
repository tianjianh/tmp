The victims had gathered on Promenade des Anglais to celebrate Bastille Day when the lorry driver struck them.
It is understood an Irishman is among those who were critically injured.
Taoiseach (Irish Prime Minister) Enda Kenny said the terror attack was an assault on innocent people during an occasion of joy and celebration.
"French people have suffered appallingly and have again been the victim of cynical and wanton violence," he added.
Irish President Michael D Higgins said news of the attack would be "received with revulsion by all those who value democracy".
"This cowardly attack in a public place on a national day of celebration must be condemned in the strongest terms," he added.
"We must strengthen our resolve not to let such cold-blooded attacks undermine the way of life in our global community seeking to live in diversity and peace."
The Irish Foreign Affairs Minister Charlie Flanagan said the "terrible events" had left him "deeply shocked and saddened".
"I deplore the loss of life, and offer heartfelt condolences to the people of France from the people of Ireland," Mr Flanagan added.
"This attack on people as they celebrated Bastille Day with friends and family on a fine summer's evening is particularly horrendous, and my thoughts and sympathies are with the relatives of the dead and injured."
Mr Flanagan advised anyone affected to "exercise caution and follow the instructions of the local authorities".
