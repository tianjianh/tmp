Louis Picamoles: Northampton forward says Premiership will make him better

Northampton's Louis Picamoles says the style of play in the Premiership will make him a better player.

The France international, 30, is one of a number of high-profile recruits to England's top division this season.
And the number eight is looking forward to the quicker pace of the Premiership compared to the French Top 14.
"Maybe it is more physical in France, but here all teams want to play a fast game, and this is good for my progression," he told BBC Radio 5 live.
The former Toulouse player, who has 54 caps, has made the unusual step of moving from France to England at the peak of his career.
And he feels his move may start a trend of players joining Premiership clubs rather than staying in the Top 14.
"In France we see that the English teams are more competitive than before, and we have seen that in the Champions Cup," he added.
"So with a lot of foreign stars [in the Top 14], maybe more French players will want to try this experience in England. I think the English league is growing.
"It's a big change for me and my family, but we are very much enjoying starting a new life and a new adventure."
Picamoles has also welcomed the difference in scheduling between the two leagues, with the later start in the Premiership campaign resulting in a longer pre-season for the players.
"In England it is better for players," he continued. "It's the first time I have had a big pre-season to prepare for the season, and it's very good for me and my body.
"It's a big problem in France, it is very dangerous for the players' body and head. Maybe fewer teams in the championship (Top 14) and fewer matches is the solution for France."
