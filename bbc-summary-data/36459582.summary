Wales dominated the first quarter with tries from Shaun Evans, Keelan Giles and Reuben Morgan-Williams.
But Ireland stormed back with touchdowns from Adam McBurney and Jacob Stockdale to make it 17-15 at the break.
Bill Johnston's boot and Stockdale's second on 67 minutes meant that Giles' late corner touchdown was not enough.
Ireland's goal-kicking was the crucial factor with Johnston's extra accuracy crucial, while number eight Max Deegan was man-of-the match.
Wales take two losing bonus points from the encounter but will have to defeat top seeds New Zealand as well as Georgia to have any chance of reaching the semi-finals.
Wales captain Tom Phillips told BBC Wales Sport: "I think discipline is where we need to improve, there were far too many penalties and they fed off our mistakes.
"Going up in the first 20 minutes doesn't make any difference when you lose a match, there was definitely some good in that but you've got to win the game.
"There were going to be handling mistakes because we were behind, trying to get the points but mistakes happen and that's just part of rugby.
"We've tasted victory [in the Six Nations] and how we respond to defeat is going to be the measure of the team. We've got four games left [in the group and play-offs] and how we bounce back is the measure of us as a squad."
