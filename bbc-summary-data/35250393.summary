A bright loft-style dance studio in a converted Glasgow factory may seem an unlikely venue for an employment scheme.
Yet it is here that social enterprise Street Step aims to kick-start young people's journey into work, training or education by raising their heart rates first.
Manager Carla Jack says many of the young people arrive with low confidence and motivation.
"Some of them have never worked - they've never even considered applying for a job," she says.
"After the eight week programme, they are speaking in front of groups, performing in front of large audiences, and they're also applying for loads of jobs."
Street Step currently runs sessions in Glasgow, London and Birmingham.
