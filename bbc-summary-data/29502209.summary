The rapper was performing at a freshers' ball at Durham University when it is claimed to have happened on Friday night.
The footage shows Professor Green walking to the side of the stage and reaching into the crowd.
He then seems to slap someone before shouting: "This is what happens when you call me a ****."
The 30-year-old has referred to the incident on Twitter, questioning reports that he hit a "fan".
He asked: "Since when is someone who hurls repeated abuse and tries to slap me a fan?"
A spokesperson for Pro Green has told Newsbeat that the rapper reacted after a student verbally abused him repeatedly and then went to "strike him".
The statement goes on to say that the student was made to leave the concert for being "too drunk" while Pro Green carried on the show to perform his full set.
Durham University and Durham Students' Union say they are aware of an incident reportedly taking place and are working together to find out what happened.
Pro Green's behaviour has been criticised with one person tweeting: "So violence is ok? If someone swears at us, just hit them?"
However, many of Pro Green fans have leapt to his defence, insisting the person responsible should not have been shouting abuse and deserved to be hit.
