[SN]TITLE[SN]

Comedian Tim Minchin, who wrote the music and lyrics for West End hit Matilda, is working on a musical adaptation of the film Groundhog Day.

Danny Rubin, who wrote the film script, and Matilda director Matthew Warchus, will also be on board.
Minchin, who revealed the news on his blog, said: "Our version of Groundhog Day is going to be both instantly recognisable, and utterly different."
The 1993 film, starring Bill Murray, is considered to be a comedy classic.
It tells the story of a grumpy weatherman who is sent to a small town to do a weather report and gets stuck in a time loop, having to live the same day over and over again until he learns how to be a better person.
Minchin wrote: "The central conceit is perfectly suited to the theatre... it has the potential to be complex, dark, visually fascinating, and thematically rich, whilst still being a joyous romantic comedy with cool tunes and lots of gags.
"It's certainly not an easy job, and I'm truly honoured - and genuinely excited - that Danny is letting me have a crack at it."

He added that Stephen Sondheim had considered adapting Groundhog Day for the stage a few years ago but "it got put on the back burner, and he is now happy that we're making a go of it. We have Steve's blessing - and it's a blessing I value enormously."
The comedian added that he hoped Groundhog Day would be on the stage in a couple of years but did not reveal where.
He has already written two ballads for the musical which he showcased at a gig in London late last year but did not reveal what the songs were in relation to.
Minchin's Matilda has been playing at the Cambridge Theatre in London's West End since October 2011, winning great critical acclaim and many accolades, including seven Laurence Olivier awards. Matilda opened in Broadway's Shubert Theatre in April 2013 - it won four Tony Awards last year, having received 12 nominations.
Last year, Minchin starred as Judas Iscariot in the arena tour of Andrew Lloyd Webber and Tim Rice musical Jesus Christ Superstar, and recently filmed his role as rock star Atticus Fetch for the sixth series of US TV comedy drama Californication.
