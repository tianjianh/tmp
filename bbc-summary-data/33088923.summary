Demolition of Colwyn Bay pier moves one step closer

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Plans to demolish a north Wales pier have moved a step closer following a decision by councillors.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Conwy council's planning committee said on Wednesday it was minded to grant conditional permission for substantial demolition of Colwyn Bay pier.
But listed building consent will still be needed from Welsh ministers.
Meanwhile, a legal fight between former owner Steve Hunt and the council is continuing, with both sides claiming they own it.
The council wants to retain 76 columns which supported the first pier, completed in 1900, but demolish the rest.
Campaigners fighting to save the pier were left disappointed after the Heritage Lottery Fund recently turned down their bid for Â£9.6m funding.
