George Osborne outlined plans in his statement to invest Â£7m in new air routes "including from Dundee to Amsterdam".
Airline Flybe had applied to a fund to establish the route to the Netherlands.
Airport operator HIAL said a new service could transform the city and the region.
Inglis Lyon, managing director of HIAL, said: "We are delighted that Flybe's application to the Regional Connectivity Fund to operate a new Dundee to Amsterdam service has been approved.
"This is a fantastic achievement for Dundee and the team who have worked tirelessly to get to this stage."
The airport said it now needed to work with Flybe, Transport Scotland and Dundee City Council to "take the successful bid forward".
