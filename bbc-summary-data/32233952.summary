Blue lights stolen from ambulances in Caernarfon

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Two emergency ambulances had to be taken off the road after thieves stole the blue lights from the vehicles.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
They were taken while the vehicles were parked overnight outside Caernarfon ambulance station in Gwynedd over the Easter weekend.
The Welsh Ambulance Service said the "reckless" and "hugely irresponsible" vandalism could put lives at risk.
The under-pressure service said it meant the vehicles could not respond to 999 calls.
It urged anybody with information to contact North Wales Police.
