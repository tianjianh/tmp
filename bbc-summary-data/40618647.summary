Great Britain won nine medals - five of them gold - on day two of the World Para-athletics Championships in London.

Richard Whitehead, Sophie Hahn, Hollie Arnold, Sammi Kinghorn and Stef Reid all won on an incredible day.
Whitehead defended his T42 200m title, as compatriot David Henson took bronze.
Rio 2016 champion Arnold took F46 javelin gold with a world record throw, Reid earned a first global title in the T44 long jump, while Kingholm and Hahn enjoyed 200m triumphs.
Kingholm and Hahn completed the T53 and T38 200m respectively in world-record time, with fellow Briton Kadeena Cox taking bronze behind Hahn.
There was also silver for Toby Gold and bronze for Andrew Small in the T33 100m to put GB top of the medal table with 12 in total across the first two days.
Whitehead, who turns 41 on Wednesday, was billed as one of the main attractions at the London Stadium - the same venue in which he won 2012 Paralympic gold.
He is now a four-time world champion, as well as a two-time Paralympic champion, and is still to compete in the 100m on Monday, an event he has never won at the Paralympics or Worlds.
Henson, who lost both of his legs in an IED explosion while serving with the military in Afghanistan, matched his bronze medal from Rio 2016.
Whitehead, who has said London could be his last track competition, told BBC Radio 5 live: "I look at Dave and he inspires me to keep going."
He added: "Ask me about retirement after the 100m."
Hahn, 20, who has cerebral palsy, has dominated the 100m in the past four years, and will defend her crown in that event on Saturday, 22 July, but had never won a global title in the 200m.
"It's incredible, an amazing feeling," said Hahn, who set a world record of 26.11 seconds. "I've never been a world champion at 200m before and to do it in front of a home crowd is phenomenal."
Cox, 26, who won gold in cycling and athletics in Rio, earned a first ever medal at 200m, but will be looking for gold in the 400m on Friday.
Kinghorn, 21, broke her own world record with a time of 28.61 seconds to upgrade from her bronze at the 2015 championships.
She has used a wheelchair since 2010 when an accident paralysed her from the waist down and has gone on to race in the same disability category as Britain's 11-time Paralympic champion Tanni Grey-Thompson.
"When I was stuck in my bed, I said I want to be like Tanni. To get close to her records and break them is incredible," she said.
Britain's co-captain Arnold, 23, who was born without her right forearm, broke her own world record by 1cm to add to her gold medals at Rio and the 2013 and 2015 Worlds.
She said: "I feel amazing. I had a great set of throws and I'm so pleased. I gave it my absolute best. It's surreal."
In the day's morning session, double Paralympic silver medallist Reid jumped 5.40m for her first global title.
Reid, 32, who lost her right foot in a boating accident as a teenager, had finished as runner-up at both London 2012 and Rio 2016 and has previously won 200m bronze at both the Paralympics and World Championships.
"It's so satisfying. It's been a long time coming," she told BBC Radio 5 live.
British sprinter Zachary Shaw failed to qualify from his 100m semi-final in the T12, for athletes with visual impairment, while Daniel Bramall finished fourth, behind Gold and Small, in the T33 100m for athletes with neurological conditions and in a wheelchair.
Elsewhere, Brazil's Paralympic champion Petrucio Ferreira set a world record on his way to T47 100m gold and there was a 12th world title for American wheelchair racer Tatyana McFadden as she took T54 200m gold in what could be the first of four victories at these championships.
