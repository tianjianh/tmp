The Wildcats crossed first through Craig Hall, but Warrington responded with 52 unanswered points.
Jack Hughes, Daryl Clark, Rhys Evans and Kurt Gidley, who also kicked seven goals, touched down before the break.
Toby King went over twice, while Chris Sandow, Stefan Ratchford, Ben Currie and Ben Westwood also scored tries.
Max Jowitt's late reply was little consolation for a Wakefield side which had been aiming to reach their first Challenge Cup final since 1979.
Warrington's progress, following Hull's victory over Wigan on Friday, means the current top two in the Super League table will contest the Challenge Cup final.
Tony Smith's men last won the Challenge Cup in 2012 and will return to Wembley after three consecutive semi-final defeats in the past three years.
Memories of the Wolves being upset by unfancied Hull KR in 2015 resurfaced when winger Hall strolled over in the corner, but Warrington were exceptional from then on.
They led 24-6 at half-time and two of their six second-half tries came while Wildcats prop David Fifita was in the sin-bin for a high shot on Sandow.
Relive Warrington's semi-final win
Warrington head coach Tony Smith: "It's been a while for our club to get to one of the big finals, so it's a nice feeling.
"The game was pretty one-sided. While Wakefield didn't give in, my team did a good job from the outset.
"The momentum of the game was one way but Chris Chester should be proud of Wakefield's efforts."
Wakefield head coach Chris Chester: "It was tough but I'm proud of these guys. We've come a long way in this short space of time. They never give in and the fans have been great today.
"Warrington were far too good for us and far too quick, and good luck to them in the final.
"I think my side will learn a lot from today and I think we tried to hard in certain areas. We'll be ok for the rest of the season."
