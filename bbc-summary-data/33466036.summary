Jim and Ann McQuire, from Cumbernauld, and Billy and Lisa Graham, from Bankfoot, near Perth, died in the attack last month.
They were among 38 people killed when gunman Seifeddine Rezgui opened fire on holidaymakers in the resort of Sousse.
Funerals for Mr and Mrs McQuire will be held on Friday afternoon, and for Mr and Mrs Graham on Monday.
The service for Mr and Mrs McQuire will take place at the Church of Scotland's Abronhill church in Cumbernauld, where they were said to have been "devoted members".
The couple will then be cremated at Daldowie Crematorium in a private ceremony.
Mrs McQuire, 64, sang and played guitar and Mr McQuire, 67, was captain of the 5th Cumbernauld Boys' Brigade company for many years.
Minister Rev Joyce Keyes said: "The church has been inundated with messages and expressions of support in the form of flowers, cards, emails, prayers and words of comfort both for the McQuire family and for the church community.
"There have been messages from people who knew Ann and Jim, and from many who didn't, even from a BB company in England.
"The church was full last Friday when we opened it for prayer and reflection, and to allow people to observe the nationwide minute's silence together."
A book of condolence at the church has been signed by hundreds of people.
The funeral of Mr and Mrs Graham will take place at Perth Crematorium on Monday. They had been in Tunisia to celebrate Mrs Graham's 50th birthday.
Their daughter Holly told The Courier newspaper: "It will be quite a sad day but we tried to make it personal for mum and dad."
Thirty of the 38 victims were British, while three Irish nationals, two Germans, one Belgian, one Portuguese and one Russian also died.
The final five bodies of British victims arrived back in the UK on Saturday. Inquests are being held into the deaths.
It is believed Rezgui - who was shot dead by police - had accomplices who helped him carry out the atrocity and the Tunisian authorities have made a number of arrests.
Defence Secretary Michael Fallon has vowed that those responsible for the massacre will be "tracked down".
