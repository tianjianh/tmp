Colombia's second-largest rebel group, the National Liberation Army (ELN), says it will not be rushed into a peace agreement.

The Marxist rebel group said it rejected an "express peace process", after the Colombian government pushed for speedy peace talks.
The two sides have agreed to open formal negotiations in neighbouring Ecuador on 27 October.
They have been engaged in an armed conflict for more than five decades.
The rebels wrote on Twitter (in Spanish) that "we are in total disagreement with the push for an express peace process because progress can't be made with narrow time limits".
The ELN said that it wanted civil society to be involved in the search for a permanent peace deal.
The Colombian government for its part is keen to reach a deal with the ELN as soon as possible.
How significant is Colombia's ELN rebel group?
The government is still reeling from the rejection by Colombians of a peace agreement with the country's largest rebel group, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Farc).
That agreement was reached after almost four years of talks in the Cuban capital, Havana.
But it was rejected by a narrow margin in a popular vote on 2 October by Colombians, many of whom thought it was too lenient on the Farc.
Government and ELN rebel negotiators announced back in March that they would open formal peace negotiations.
But the talks, originally scheduled to start in May, were delayed after the ELN rebels failed to meet the government's demand that it stop kidnapping people.
The ELN has since made a commitment not to carry out any more kidnappings, Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos said.
The group has released three hostages over the past weeks and is expected to free another two before the start of the talks in Quito.
