The teams, who drew 1-1 in their last meeting at the 2015 Cyprus Cup, face each other on 29 November at Koning Willem II Stadion.
"This will be an important experience for the group both on and off the field," manager Mark Sampson said.
England's seven-match unbeaten run ensured they finished top of their Euro 2017 qualifying group in September.
"The Netherlands have some exceptional individual talent and have been outstanding in their recent matches so we are looking forward to a competitive game," Sampson added.
England's preparations for Euro 2017, to be held in July and August, get under way in October when they host France at the Keepmoat Stadium in Doncaster.
