The major overhaul of Regent Street, Drumgold Street and Victoria Street will see new paving, lighting and seating installed.
Infrastructure minister David Cretney said the work will "help to bring the town centre in to the 21st Century".
The works will begin on Monday and continue until 15 November.
All businesses will remain open throughout the project.
According to the government, teams will work six days a week during the project to minimise disruption.
Mr Cretney said: "We hope the works will help to ensure the long-term vitality of the town centre."
He added that "some disruption would be inevitable".
The main shopping streets in Douglas have not been updated for more than 25 years.
The first phase of the project saw the redevelopment of Nelson Street and Wellington Street.
The scheme, which has a total budget of Â£5m, will eventually see the whole of Strand Street completed.
