Andre Savelio crossed for Wolves early on, but tries from Jese Sene-Lefao, Zak Hardaker, Eden and Luke Gale gave the visitors a commanding lead.
Tom Lineham went over either side of half-time to reduce Warrington's deficit to six points.
Tries from Eden and Greg Minikin sealed the victory for Tigers, despite Savelio getting his second of the night.
Warrington had beaten Brisbane Broncos in the World Club Series in their previous fixture, but they remain without a point in Super League, having lost at Catalans in their season opener.
Castleford are top of the table and the highest scoring side in the league, despite playing one game fewer than both Huddersfield and Leeds - two of four sides level on points with the Tigers.
Former Man of Steel Hardaker scored his first try since joining on loan from Rhinos, while Eden now has three tries in two games since rejoining the club from Brisbane.
Tigers will aim to maintain their unbeaten record against Leeds in their next fixture, while Warrington will travel to Salford in search of their first points of the new campaign.
Warrington head coach Tony Smith:
"We couldn't cope with the speed of the play the ball and they blew our legs off in the first half and conceding back-to-back tries really hurts you.
"A few of our boys were off their best from their performance last week and you can't afford to be when your opposition has some attack in them.
"The players showed character to get back to a point that with a bit more fortune we could pinch the game.
"But to concede 30 points is not pleasing in our dressing room."
Castleford head coach Daryl Powell told BBC Radio Leeds:
"We had some tough patches in the game that we had to ride through, but I thought our players were awesome in finding a way to win when it looked like they were in the ascendancy.
"I'm just delighted that we've got a group of boys who can do some special things on a rugby field.
"They found a way to get in touching distance of us, which good sides can do to you. But we were durable enough to win the game which was obviously very pleasing."
