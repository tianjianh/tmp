Coutinho, 24, was taken off on a stretcher after colliding with Didier Ndong of Sunderland during the first half of Saturday's 2-0 win at Anfield.
"Phil needs between five and a few weeks until we have him back," Klopp told BBC Radio 5 live.
"We will see. He is not in Tuesday's cup game and for the next few games."
It means Coutinho, one of Klopp's most influential players as the Reds have moved into second place in the Premier League, will miss key games.
Liverpool face Everton in the Merseyside derby at Goodison Park on 19 December, and meet Manchester City at Anfield on New Year's Eve.
Coutinho was at Liverpool's Melwood training headquarters on Sunday, leaving on crutches with his right ankle in a protective boot before having his scan 24 hours later.
Klopp will also be without Â£34m summer signing Sadio Mane in January as the striker will be on Africa Cup of Nations duty with Senegal.
Adam Lallana, who has missed Liverpool's past two Premier League games after injuring his groin during England's 2-2 draw with Spain at Wembley, continues to make good progress.
He is in training again under the guidance of Liverpool's fitness coaches but was not considered for the EFL Cup tie against Leeds.
