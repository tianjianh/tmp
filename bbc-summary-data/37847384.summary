Historic Yarrow Valley bridge repairs to begin

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A 13-week programme of works is scheduled to begin next week to repair a historic bridge in the Borders.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Broadmeadows Bridge in the Yarrow Valley was damaged by a vehicle in September last year.
The crossing on the A708 has had temporary traffic lights in place since then to allow its continued use.
A Â£100,000 rebuilding programme will now get under way on Monday with lights continuing to be used to allow the bridge to remain open to traffic.
Councillor Gordon Edgar said: "The council has recognised the importance of keeping Broadmeadows Bridge open for the local community.
"The A708 is a vital route for the Yarrow Valley community and a temporary diversion would have caused significant disruption.
"The council thanks the local community for their patience and will carry out the works safely, and as quickly as possible."
