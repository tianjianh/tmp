Britain's Jamie Murray and Australian John Peers suffered a dramatic defeat by the Bryan brothers to go out of the ATP World Tour Finals in London.

Murray and Peers lost 6-7 (5-7) 7-6 (7-5) 16-14 after squandering five match points, including four from 9-5 up.
"We blew it," Murray told the BBC. "We should have won that match, no question about it. We had enough chances."
American top seeds and reigning champions Bob and Mike Bryan move into the semi-finals on Saturday.
Murray and Peers were playing together for the last time before teaming up with new partners for 2016.
The Scot, 29, will play with Brazil's Bruno Soares in 2016.
A superb season in which Murray and Peers reached Grand Slam finals at Wimbledon and the US Open looked certain to extend into the final weekend when they moved 9-5 clear in the match tie-break.
The fourth seeds had let a 5-2 lead slip before edging the first set, and were hauled back from 5-3 up in the second set tie-break.
It appeared that those missed opportunities would not matter when they held four match points in a row in the decider, but nerves struck and a desperate Peers forehand with the open court begging at 9-8 was a hammer blow.
"I didn't quite get over the top of the ball unfortunately," said the Australian afterwards. "Then it sailed long.
"I probably should have put one back through him, but that's tennis, and unfortunately it happens."
A thrilling contest saw both sides battle nerves with victory in sight, but it was the four-time champions who clinched it at their fifth opportunity.
There will not be much time for Murray to recover from the disappointment of defeat in London, as he expects to be heading to Belgium on Sunday.
He is likely to play a key role alongside his brother, Andy, in the doubles when Britain attempt to win the Davis Cup for the first time since 1936 next week.
"I'm very motivated, it's an unbelievable opportunity for us," added Murray.
"It hasn't happened so often for Britain and we want to get out there and give it our best shot, and try and lift the trophy."
