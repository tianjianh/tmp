England hooker Tom Youngs suffered his latest back injury changing a tyre on his car at home, but should be ready to lead Leicester in Europe next week, says Tigers boss Richard Cockerill.

Youngs missed Saturday's derby win over Northampton Saints after initially being named in the team.
The 29-year-old, capped 22 times by England, had back surgery in March.
"He was lifting the wheel in to the back of the car and his back spasmed," Cockerill told BBC Radio Leicester.
"He did it Friday morning, bizarrely changing a tyre on his car at home. He was hugely improved today, but just not quite right.
"We tried to get him to the start line - he has had back issues previously so the right thing to do was start with Harry Thacker, and George McGuigan did a great job off the bench."
Leicester, fourth in the Premiership after 10 games, travel to Munster next Saturday looking for their second European Champions Cup win of the campaign.
After two group games, Tigers are third in Pool One behind Minster and Glasgow.
