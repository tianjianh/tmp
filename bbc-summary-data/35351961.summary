[SN]TITLE[SN]
Martin McGuinness to appear before legacy inquest over IRA activities

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness has agreed to appear before a legacy inquest to give evidence about the IRA's activities in Londonderry in 1972.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Sinn FÃ©in politician was asked to give a statement to the inquest by the family of Seamus Bradley.
Mr Bradley, an IRA man, was shot dead by a soldier during the Army's Operation Motorman.
The inquest heard that Mr McGuinness will co-operate fully.
The two-week review will look into some of the most controversial killings of the Troubles.
Lord Justice Weir is examining 56 cases involving 97 deaths.
The killings include those by police officers and soldiers, and others where there are allegations of state collusion.
Mr Bradley's family says the Army knew the IRA was not active on the day he was shot dead and that the use of lethal force was not justified.
Operation Motorman was the name given to a military operation by the Army to reclaim 'no-go areas' set up by republican paramilitaries in towns across Northern Ireland.
Mr Bradley was killed on 31 July 1972 in the Creggan area of Derry.
In 2012, the Historical Enquiries Team ruled that the soldier that killed Mr Bradley had acted lawfully.
Meanwhile, it has also emerged that Sinn FÃ©in's Gerry Kelly may be asked to give evidence at the inquest into the killing of dissident republican Gareth O'Connor.
Mr O'Connor disappeared after driving through Newtownhamilton in south Armagh in 2003. In June 2005, his badly decomposed body was discovered in his car in Newry Canal.
His family have said Mr Kelly told them he spoke to the Provisional IRA and it was not responsible for the killing.
