A man approached him from behind and pushed him to the floor at the Arcadia Sports Centre in Levenshulme, Manchester at about 20:45 BST on Thursday, police said.
The boy was cut on his arms but managed to run away. The man returned to the reception and left with another man.
An 18-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of assault.
Ch Insp Dave Gilbride said: "This was a shocking unprovoked attack on a teenager who was in a quiet area of the leisure centre with his friends, revising for his GCSE exams.
"Despite this man's attempts, the boy received only minor injuries, however he is understandably very shaken up by his ordeal.
"We are treating the incident very seriously and we believe it was a hate crime."
Anyone who has become a victim of a hate incident or crime is urged to report it.
Greater Manchester Police earlier said there had been a significant rise in hate crimes reported following Monday's arena attack, in which 22 people died.
The force said the number of such reports had doubled to 56 on Wednesday, from the 28 reported on Monday.
