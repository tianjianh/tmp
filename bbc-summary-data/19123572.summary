Locog said there were more than half a million spectators at Olympic events on Friday including 221,000 at the Olympic Park in east London.
Spokeswoman Jackie Brock-Doyle said athletes and officials had been "wowed" by the response of the British public.
Meanwhile, GB's gold medal total has hit 14, with triumphs by Mo Farah, Jessica Ennis, and Greg Rutherford.
London 2012 is already Britain's joint third most successful gold medal haul in the history of the Olympic Games.
The six gold medals on Saturday marks Britain's greatest Olympic day since 1908, when eight were won on 11 July at the London Games.
In other developments:
Locog said there had been 4.4 million spectators at the Olympics so far, including the cycling road races, and more than one million visitors to the Olympic Park. Some 51,000 tickets were sold online on Friday.

A friend had a spare ticket for the Olympics stadium on Saturday evening. Would I like to go? It didn't take long to make up my mind. I was hoping for a night of enjoyable Olympic action. I couldn't have dared dream that I would be there for a night of sporting history.
As the evening sun lit up the stadium, the action really began. Jessica Ennis was roared on as soon as she appeared on the big screen. Her win in the heptathlon 800m set the stadium alight.
It was like a three-ring circus. There was too much happening at once. Greg Rutherford was going for gold in the long jump, while Mo Farah was tucking in nicely in the early stages of the 10,000 metres. We couldn't possibly win a hat-trick of golds could we? It was too much to hope for.
But Mo cruised to victory in style and 80,000 people became one delirious mob. And in years to come, I can proudly say I was there the night Great Britain won three gold medals in one hour.
Ms Brock-Doyle said: "We always knew we would end up with full stadia. We knew the British public would buy the tickets and come out in force. They have been unbelievable.
"I don't think there's a single athlete or chef de mission or international federation that hasn't been wowed by the spectators. It's not just the British athletes and participants, it's the amazing support they give every athlete as they compete.
"People talk about the braveheart and the lionheart of the British public and I think people have seen that. They have been spectacular."
Locog said 30,000 - half of those on sale - out of the 80,000 seats for the prestigious men's 100m final at the Olympic Stadium on Sunday evening had been sold to members of the British public.
In the rowing at Eton Dorney, gold for the men's four of Andrew Triggs-Hodge, Pete Reed, Tom James, and Alex Gregory's meant Great Britain have won the event for the fourth Olympics in a row.
Sophie Hosking and Katherine Copeland then took gold in the women's double sculls.
Transport bosses said Tube and train services were busy but there were no delays.
The Association of Train Operating Companies urged people to plan ahead for the next few days - expected to be the Games' busiest.
Train companies said they were providing an additional two million seats to get spectators to venues this weekend.
A spokesman also thanked passengers for helping the rail network "to run smoothly" by avoiding congested stations and staggering journeys.
