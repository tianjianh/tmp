[SN]TITLE[SN]
Choose Pharmacy service launched to help GPs in Wales

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Pharmacies can provide new NHS support and care for people with minor illnesses as part of a plan to free up GPs' time.

They will be able to access patients' health records with their consent to provide help rather than people having to visit their GP.
The Welsh government has spent Â£750,000 integrating technology for the service.
The Choose Pharmacy service follows pilots in north Wales and the Cwm Taf health board area in south Wales.
It will allow, for example, patients' hospital discharge information to be shared with a nominated pharmacy so a follow-up review can be completed by a pharmacist.
Deputy Health Minister Vaughan Gething said: "Giving pharmacists access to patients' summary medical records will significantly reduce the number of people who need to be referred to GP, out-of-hours services and A&E departments.
"It will free up GPs' time to focus on those people with more complex cases and reduce patient waiting times."
There are more than 700 pharmacies in Wales dealing with a number of health and welfare services commissioned by the local health board.
