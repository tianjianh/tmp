[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Silkmen led 2-0 in little more than a quarter of an hour, Neil Byrne heading the opener from Danny Whitaker's cross before Andy Halls set up a near-identical second for Anthony Dudley.
Ryan Higgins halved the deficit three minutes before half-time, cutting in from the right and firing home from 30 yards.
Byrne saw a long-range effort pushed wide by Chris Cheetham and Mitch Hancox headed against the bar from close range as the visitors sought to kill the game off, but two goals proved to be enough.
