The family of a British man who reportedly travelled to Iraq to join the so-called Islamic State group said the claims were "completely false".

Jack Letts, 20, from Oxford, has been labelled "Jihadi Jack" by some newspapers, which reported he left the UK to join the group when he was 18.
His parents John and Sally Letts said their son wanted to travel to Syria for humanitarian reasons.
And on his Facebook page Jack Letts also said the reports were false.
Speaking to the Oxford Mail newspaper Mr and Mrs Letts described their son as "a really kind, funny kid who is very gentle".
His mother said media reports claiming he had adopted the name Ibrahim or Abu Muhammed and had a son in Iraq were "absolutely ridiculous".
But she said he had converted to Islam and reports he was married could be true.
On Facebook, Jack Letts said: "Maybe they got bored worrying about what colour socks certain celebrities wear and took out the frustration on me."
A Thames Valley Police spokesman said: "We are unable to comment on any specific cases in relation to individuals.
"Anyone who knows of someone who may be potentially vulnerable to being drawn into terrorist-related activity, including travelling abroad to conflict zones, should contact local police for advice and support."
