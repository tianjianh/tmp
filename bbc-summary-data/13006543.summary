[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Many Cambodian newspapers and private broadcasters depend on support from political parties. Prime Minister Hun Sen and his allies control several outlets.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Imprisonment can be imposed for "spreading false information or insulting public officials", Freedom House reports. Mam Sonando, the owner of Beehive Radio, one of the few outlets to criticise the government, was jailed for 20 years in 2012 on charges he helped foment a secessionist rebellion.
There are no restrictions on satellite receivers and radio stations from neighbouring countries can be heard.
BBC World Service broadcasts via BBC 100 FM in Phnom Penh and BBC 99.25 FM in Siem Reap. Radio France Internationale and Radio Australia are available in the capital.
By June 2012 there were nearly 663,000 internet users (InternetWorldStats). Access is largely limited to the main towns and cities.
There are no reports of widespread filtering of content. A 2012 decree bans internet cafes from locating near schools, or allowing users to "commit crimes that threaten national security or traditions".
