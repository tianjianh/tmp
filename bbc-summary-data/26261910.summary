They took an early lead through Ilya Kovalchuk, but the Finns hit back with goals from Juhamatti Aaltonen, Teemu Selanne and Mikael Granlund.
They will face Nordic rivals Sweden in the semis, while Canada will play USA.
USA eased to a 5-2 win over Czech Republic but holders Canada struggled to a 2-1 win over Latvia.
A powerplay strike from Nashville Predators defenceman Shea Weber, with less than seven minutes to play, proved decisive for the eight-time champions.
Both semi-finals take place on Friday.
