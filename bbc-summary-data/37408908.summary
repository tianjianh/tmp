Yeovil Town manager Darren Way says the fans are still behind him, despite their inconsistent form in League Two.

The Glovers beat against Leyton Orient on Saturday but lost their last five games in the run-up to the 1-0 victory.
"I've come in, worked hard and stood strong. We had a bad run of defeats but I have learnt so much," Way said.
"From the moment I got off the bus [on the way to the game against Orient], there were two supporters who said 'I'm with you Darren'."
Way's side had conceded eight goals in their three games before the trip to Brisbane Road, but kept a clean sheet as Tom Eaves' 76th-minute strike gave them three points against Orient.
Despite taking just seven points from a possible 24 this term after a promising end to last season, Way says he is learning a lot from his first full campaign as Glovers manager.
"I've learnt not just about my players but everything," Way told BBC Radio Somerset.
"I went over to speak to the supporters before the game and they said they're with me.
"What I know is everyone I'm coming into contact with face to face are behind this football club."
