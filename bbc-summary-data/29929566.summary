More than 30 pupils were barred from an academy in Bradford as a row over uniform policy continued.

They were turned away as Hanson Academy's head teacher Elizabeth Churton's crackdown entered a third day.
On Tuesday, 152 pupils were sent home, with 63 on Wednesday and 33 turned away on Thursday, the third day of the saga.
The school has received a mixed reaction from parents on its Facebook page.
Pupils face being sent home for a variety of reasons, that include the wearing of hoop earrings, two earrings or more per ear or patterned trousers.
Students are also not allowed to have an unnatural hair colour or wear jumpers, jackets or coats indoors.  There are also strict rules about the type of footwear allowed.
Parent Diane Hickey's 13-year-old daughter was sent home on Tuesday and again on Wednesday because she was wearing black pumps.
"I'm not buying her a new pair of shoes. I'm a single parent. I can't afford a new pair of shoes," she said.
Miss Hickey said she was not prepared to change her daughter's footwear as she has been wearing the same shoes to school for the past two years.
She said: "I don't think it's fair she's been sent home twice. She's embarrassed we can't afford new footwear.
"I think it's ridiculous. I am keeping her home today because what's the point in making her walk to school if she's going to be sent home?"
In an earlier statement, Mrs Churton said: "We explained that students who arrived to school with a uniform issue that could be resolved would be sent home to rectify and parents would be contacted.
"As forewarned, some students were sent home for this reason.
"They were sent home to change and the majority rectified this immediately and returned to school ready to learn."
The principal said rules were an important part of growing up to get students ready for "adult life".
