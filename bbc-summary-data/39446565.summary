Lindahl, 33, who has been with Chelsea since December 2014, won Olympic silver with her country in Rio in 2016.
She helped the Blues win a domestic double in 2015, with their first league title following Women's FA Cup success.
"She is probably the best goalkeeper in the world on current form," manager Emma Hayes told the club website.
"We're really looking for continuity and stability with our squad as we look to challenge for honours, especially in European competition."
