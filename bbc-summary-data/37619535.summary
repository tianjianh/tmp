The 23-year-old made his first-class debut against Pakistan in July, but scored only 10 and eight in his two innings against the tourists.
He also played four One-Day Cup games and one T20 Blast fixture this summer.
"My goals for 2017 are to earn a regular spot within the top order and consistently contribute towards winning games," he told Somerset's website.
