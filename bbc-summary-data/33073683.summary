They targeted Land Rovers belonging to the Llanberis Mountain Rescue Team (LMRT) in Nant Peris.
North Wales Police is investigating the attack.
On Sunday, LMRT was involved in a rescue near Llanberis waterfall after four swimmers got into difficulty and two men died.
Police said that as well as battery cables being cut, bolts to doors were removed.
Officers said it was only "by chance" that no emergency calls were received on Tuesday, as the rescue teams would not have been able to respond.
