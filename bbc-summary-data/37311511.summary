Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp says he has no problem with Mamadou Sakho but the defender has to regain fitness to stand a chance of a first-team return.

France international Sakho, 26, had a doping case against him dismissed by Uefa in July.
He was then sent home from the club's pre-season tour in the United States after being late three times and also told he could leave the club on loan.
"It is not a problem. He doesn't have to gain my trust," said Klopp.
Sakho has not played since April, when it emerged he had tested positive for a type of fat burner the previous month. The case was later dismissed by European football's governing body.
The player then turned down moves to Premier League sides Stoke and West Brom, and Turkish club Besiktas, in the summer.
"He couldn't play football for a long time," added Klopp.
"Now it is about making Mama fit - what he isn't after this long time with suspension and injury - and we will see what happens.
"I have no idea what happens when because it is who plays how, who performs when, our results.
"At the end Mama knows and I know and from my side that is enough."
Sakho joined Liverpool for Â£18m from Paris St-Germain in 2013 and has made 55 appearances for the Premier League side.
