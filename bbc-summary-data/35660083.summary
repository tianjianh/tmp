The barrier, built in the 1980s, is on the city's Crumlin Road and encloses part of the Ardoyne area.
It is owned by Northern Ireland's housing authority, which is replacing it with railings and decorative panels after "talks within and between communities" in the area.
This footage from the Northern Ireland Housing Executive shows the wall being knocked down.
