Hugh Morris: Glamorgan chief executive considering extra coach

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Glamorgan chief executive Hugh Morris says the club is still considering whether to add an extra coach to the staff after Robert Croft's promotion to head coach.

Former captain Croft, 45, was elevated to the top role after the December departure of Toby Radford.
"We're just weighing up our options at the moment," Morris said.
"But we're very lucky that we've got a number of really good coaches with ECB qualifications."
Last season former England spinner Croft acted as Radford's assistant, while former Glamorgan seamer David Harrison also worked with the first team.
Ex-Glamorgan and England fast bowler Steve Watkin spent most of his time in charge of the second eleven.
"Dave Harrison's a level-four coach, Steve Watkin's a level-four coach, and (wicketkeeper-batsman) Mark Wallace is on his level-four programme already," Morris added.

"We've got a lot of options, and we've got two very experienced batters in Jacques Rudolph and Colin Ingram who will have an important role to play.
"Although he (Rudolph) has a lot more playing time ahead of him, he's a top class player and he's very much captain of the club."
Glamorgan are also looking to recruit a second overseas player for the T20 Blast, though Morris admits it is a difficult task given clashes with international matches and other T20 tournaments.
Last season South African fast bowler Wayne Parnell played in eight of Glamorgan's 14 matches, and could be under consideration if he is available for enough games.
"It would obviously bolster our squad to have a second player, but not only is the IPL at the beginning of our T20 tournament, the Caribbean Premier League is in June and July," Morris said.
"South Africa, West Indies and Australia are playing a Tri-Nations tournament as well, so the pool that we can choose from is not a massive one."
Glamorgan have signed Netherlands fast bowler Timm van der Gugten and young Australian batsman Nick Selman, as well as converting all-rounder Craig Meschede's loan spell into a three-year contract.
Any further additions to the Championship squad are unlikely.
