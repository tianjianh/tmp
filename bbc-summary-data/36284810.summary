Joan Rivers family settles medical case

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The family of Joan Rivers has settled its legal case against a medical clinic in New York which it blamed for her death in 2014.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Rivers died days after she suffered a cardiac arrest while undergoing a procedure to examine her throat.
Her family had claimed the Yorkville Endoscopy centre performed unauthorised procedures on the comedian.
It also alleged the clinic failed to take appropriate action when her vital signs weakened.
The family said it was pleased with the settlement but did not reveal the amount of compensation.
Joan Rivers's daughter, Melissa, filed a malpractice suit in January 2015, alleging doctors posed for selfies with her mother while she was unconscious.
In a statement, she said the settlement allowed her to "put the legal aspects of my mother's death behind me and ensure that those culpable for her death have accepted responsibility for their actions quickly and without equivocation".
The Rivers' lawyers said the doctors had not denied responsibility.
Shortly before the lawsuit was filed, a government health agency, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, cited the Yorkville clinic for failing to follow standard protocols during its treatment of Rivers.
After the settlement was announced, the Yorkville clinic said: "Our thoughts and prayers continue to go out to the Rivers family.
"We remain committed to providing quality, compassionate healthcare services that meet the needs of our patients, their families and the community."
