Susan Workman murder: Killer's family post ad to trace jury

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The family of a man jailed for murdering his ex-wife have taken out a newspaper advert in an attempt to trace the jurors involved in his trial, prompting a police investigation.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Ian Workman, of Turton, Lancashire, was jailed for life in 2011 after he was convicted of stabbing Susan Workman to death in a row over their divorce.
The advert appealed for the jury to take part in a "documentary".
Police said they were investigating to see if any crime has been committed.
The advert, published in the Lancashire Evening Post on 30 April, offered Â£1,000 for the jury members to give their opinion on "new evidence" relating to the conviction of millionaire car dealer Workman.
At no stage did it mention it had been placed by associates of Mr Workman, but his son Grant confirmed to the newspaper that they were responsible for it.
He said the plan was to create a film of the jurors discussing fresh evidence about the case and publish it on YouTube.
Mr Workman said the family had taken legal advice and were confident they were doing nothing wrong in placing the advert.
Under the Juries Act 1974, it is an offence to disclose information about a jury's deliberations or to solicit or obtain such information.
Workman, who has now been in prison for more than four years, stabbed his former wife once in the chest, before wiping the blood from his hands and the knife and calling the emergency services.
He then inflicted wounds to his own stomach in a bid to disguise his crime and told police his ex-wife had attacked him, Preston Crown Court heard.
Workman, then aged 58, has always maintained his innocence and claimed his ex-wife's injuries were self-inflicted.
