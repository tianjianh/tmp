The England international, 24, has not featured for club or country since June 2015 after fracturing his fibula.
But he managed 65 minutes in the U21 Premier League game.
"I want to go to the Euros. To do that I have to get in the Arsenal team, so I have to show the Arsenal and England managers what I can do," said Wilshere.
"It felt really good to be back out there playing. I'm not ready yet for the first team, but it's another step on the road to fitness. It felt good to play in a match - it's totally different to training."
Arsenal have seven Premier League games remaining this season, while England manager Roy Hodgson will name his Euro 2016 squad on 12 May.
The return of Wilshere will be a boost for Hodgson, particularly as it came on the day that another England midfielder, Jordan Henderson, was ruled out for the rest of the season with a knee injury.
Another long-term injury absentee, Tomas Rosicky, also featured in Arsenal's 3-1 win against Newcastle at Emirates Stadium.
The Czech Republic midfielder, 35, has been out with a thigh problem and has made only one first-team appearance this season.
