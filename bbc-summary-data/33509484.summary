[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Signaller Stephen Fry, 20, was discovered in the River Foss on Thursday following reports of him being in the water near Merchant Hall, in the Piccadilly area, late on Wednesday.
Signaller Fry, originally from Surrey, served with the 2nd Signal Regiment at Imphal Barracks in York.
An inquest is due to open on Wednesday, though police say the death is not being treated as suspicious.
Lt Col Ian Hargreaves, Commanding Officer 2nd Signal Regiment, said the regiment's thoughts were with Signaller Fry's family and friends.
He said: "He approached every military challenge with confidence, intelligence and good humour.
"Having made a great start in the Royal Corps of Signals, he had prospects of a fine career ahead of him.
"A hugely popular soldier, everyone in the regiment will miss him."
