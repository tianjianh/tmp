[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Six scooters are available on loan to people aged 17-64 and who live in the Swansea area from Â£36 a week.
The cost covers tax, insurance and maintenance of the scooter, as well as some training.
The Wheels to Work scheme will benefit workers who either do not have their own transport or find it difficult to use public transport.
Swansea council bought the scooters with money from the Welsh Government and funding from Unilever.
