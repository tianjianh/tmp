Lee Irving killing: Victim 'beaten for prolonged period'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man with learning disabilities died after he was repeatedly beaten over a prolonged period of time, Newcastle Crown Court has heard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Lee Irving, 24, was found dead next to a footpath in Fawdon, Newcastle, in June 2015. Police have not revealed how he died.
He had 27 rib fractures and a broken nose and jaw, the prosecution said.
James Wheatley, 29, of Studdon Walk, Newcastle and Barry Imray, 35, of no fixed address, deny his murder.
The pair, along with Julie Mills and Nicole Lawrence, are also accused of causing or allowing his death.
All four deny the charges.
It is alleged Mr Irving had been sedated rather than taken for medical treatment by the defendants who were all living at a house in Kenton Bar at the time.
The court heard how Mr Irving's body was found about half a mile from the house.
Robert Smith QC, prosecuting, told the court Mr Imray had used a pushchair to move the body.
Mr Imray, than rang the emergency services and told them he had found a man lying on the footpath, he said.
Ms Mills and Ms Lawrence are also accused of perverting the course of justice, which they also deny.
The case continues.
