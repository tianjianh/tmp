The six scheduled fixtures for Ireland are a major boost after they retained their ODI status at the recent World Cup Qualifier in Sri Lanka.
"It's fantastic news for the squad and has given everyone involved a real lift," said Irish coach Aaron Hamilton.
"It'll be a great experience for the players touring South Africa and a chance to continue their development."
He added: "We had a real hard-fought series against South Africa last summer winning two matches, and this tour is a consequence of our performances in those games.
"This series gives us all something to look forward to."
All games will be held in Potchefstroom, with four matches scheduled for Senwes Park and two games at The PUK Oval.
India and South Africa will both play in this summer's World Cup in England, which begins on 24 June.
