[SN]TITLE[SN]
Duchess of Cornwall 'knights farmer' with leek

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Duchess of Cornwall has "knighted a farmer" at the South of England Show - with a leek.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Camilla, who is the president of the South of England Agricultural Society, is in Ardingly in East Sussex for the show's 50th anniversary.
During her tour, an actor playing a grumpy farmer got down on one knee and begged her to "knight me please".
He told the shocked but amused duchess: "I'm wearing thigh high rubber just for you Madam."
Camilla tapped him gently on one shoulder but he complained: "Is that it, just the one shoulder?"
He added: "Oh you aren't the Queen, you can't do two?"
Camilla declined the request but told him his rubber was "very smart" before placing the leek back in its box.
