Equipment contaminated with blood was uncovered during an inspection of Dr Gray's Hospital in Elgin.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Three requirements have been made in a Healthcare Environment Inspectorate report after an unannounced inspection in April.
However the HEI said the inspection was largely positive and there was a good standard of environmental cleanliness at the hospital.
NHS Grampian said an action plan had been developed.
An NHS Grampian spokesperson said: "NHS Grampian is pleased that in this predominantly positive report the inspection team found good levels of both environmental cleanliness and compliance with infection prevention and control procedures at Dr Gray's. Patients also spoke highly of cleanliness at the hospital.
"The report makes three requirements. An action plan has been developed to meet these and work is progressing."
