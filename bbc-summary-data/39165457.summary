People in Japan get very excited about the flowers blooming as it signals the beginning of spring.
Lots of people all over the country get together and have big festivals in parks and eat special cherry blossom themed food.
They even have cherry blossom weather reports, to tell people when the flowers will be blooming in their area.
This is because the flowers only bloom for a short amount of time, so people want to celebrate them before they disappear.
These flowers are from the Kochi area in western Japan, where more than 1,000 cherry trees have been planted.
