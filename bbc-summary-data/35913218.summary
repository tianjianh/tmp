The constables were on patrol on Kenton Road, Harrow, at about 13:30 BST when they were called over by a driver who was carrying a passenger in labour.
They assisted the woman with the birth and baby Alex was born into a police fleece.
Police tweeted to say it was "a special Easter delivery". Mother and baby were later taken to hospital by ambulance.
"We send all good wishes to baby Alex and family," the Metropolitan Police said.
The two officers have not been identified.
