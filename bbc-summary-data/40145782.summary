The 21-year-old, part of Britain's C1 team event winners on Friday, finished more than two seconds ahead of the Czech Republic's Tereza Fiserova in Tacen, Slovenia on Saturday.
"To win two golds this weekend is really exciting," said Woods.
It was a second European singles gold medal for Woods after her 2015 success.
