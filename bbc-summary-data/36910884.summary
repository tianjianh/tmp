Germany's Angelique Kerber, the highest ranked player in the draw following the withdrawal of Serena Williams, beat Croatian Mirjana Lucic-Baroni 6-3 4-6 6-3.
Polish fourth seed Agnieszka Radwanska beat Monica Niculescu of Romania 6-1 7-5, and home favourite Eugenie Bouchard of Canada was impressive in a 6-2 6-0 win over Slovakian 11th seed Dominika Cibulkova.
World number one Novak Djokovic returned to action for the first time since his shock third-round defeat at Wimbledon with a 7-5 7-6 (7-3) win over Luxembourg's Gilles Muller at the men's Rogers Cup in Toronto.

"It was hot and that made the ball move very fast. It was hard to control, it was not easy to play. But I managed to stay tough."
Canadian 17-year-old Denis Shapovalov, who beat Nick Kyrgios in round one, went down 6-4 6-3 to Bulgaria's Grigor Dimitrov.
