Robert Bavington, 28, of Rugby, fell to the ground in the attack and hit his head. He died in hospital.
Vijay Masih, 31, of Willenhall, West Midlands, denied his manslaughter in April last year but was found guilty at Warwick Crown Court.
Police said it was an unprovoked attack and described it as "a senseless act... with no real meaning or justification".
Mr Bavington was attacked in the early hours of 10 April outside Moo Bar on Russell Street in Leamington.

Det Ch Insp Liam Barry, of Warwickshire Police, said Mr Bavington was "a young man of fine character with his life very much ahead of him".
"The sentence handed to the defendant will not bring Robert back or take away the trauma, pain and suffering caused but I hope they will be able to take comfort from the fact Masih will be behind bars and will not be able to cause harm to another family," he said.
