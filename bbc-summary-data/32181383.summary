[SN]TITLE[SN]
Giant model railway opens to public in Cheshire

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A "giant" model railway exhibit measuring 34ft (10m) by 14ft (4m) has gone on display in Cheshire.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The railway was built by Will Snook, who lives in Crewe, to raise money for charity.
The railway, which took 18 months to build and was put together by a team of seven, includes two tracks - one with a post-1955 steam engine and one with a post-1994 diesel train.
It will be on display in the village hall in Wrenbury until Monday.
Mr Snook expects the completed model, which will involve up to 17 lines, to be finished by October.
It will then go on display at Birmingham's NEC, as part of the Warley National Model Railway Exhibition, before touring in shows around the country.
Mr Snook, 26, an insurance assessor, has been a model railway enthusiast for 11 years.
"I believe this is one of the biggest model railways with a round layout in the UK," he said.
