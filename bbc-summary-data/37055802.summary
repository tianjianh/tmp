The Scarlets flanker, 25, starred after instead being selected for Rio with Britain beaten by Fiji in the final.
Davies had been tipped to be part of Wales' squad for the June tour, which would have ruled him out of the Games.
"I'm just so thankful I didn't go on that tour now, but hopefully that call does one day come," he said.
Davies has previously said he made himself available for Wales' three-Test tour of New Zealand, but was overlooked, opening the way for him to train with Great Britain's sevens squad between May and July.
He was also not included in Wales' squad for the 2015 World Cup, which ran from September to October.
"I'd just like to say thanks to Mr Gatland for not picking me for the autumn because this has been the best experience of my life.

"If that call comes one day it would be another incredible achievement. I'll just wait and see."
Davies was disappointed not to win gold, but admitted Fiji were the better side as they ran out  43-7 winners.
"They were outstanding and they've been the best team in the series for two years now. They thoroughly deserved to take the gold."
Great Britain - who also featured Welshman Sam Cross - were unbeaten in the competition going into the inaugural men's rugby sevens final, which they reached with a narrow 7-5 win over second seeds South Africa.
"It does feel quite special, this is a moment I'm never going to forget. I'm just so glad to be a part of it," said Davies.
"This has been an incredible journey and thankfully the Scarlets let me do it."
