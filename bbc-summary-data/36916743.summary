More than 150 calls have been made to the dedicated hotline set-up following the attempted abduction of an RAF serviceman in Norfolk.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Police have said they are following up a number of calls to identify the two men who tried to bundle the serviceman into a car near RAF Marham on 20 July.
Roadblocks set up by the police have also identified some drivers with dash board cameras.
Police said it would be a lengthy investigation.
The serviceman had been out running when he was threatened by two men.
Six road blocks were put in place at the scene and drivers have been handed leaflets featuring e-fit images of the two men involved in the attack.
Det Supt Paul Durham, from Norfolk Constabulary, said the investigation required painstaking detailed enquiries.
He said the footage from the dash board cameras had been retrieved and was set to be reviewed.
He urged drivers who use the area to look at the e-fit images and to make contact with the police should they recognise either of the men.
The first suspect is described as of "Middle Eastern appearance", between 20 and 30 years old, approximately 6ft (1.8m) tall, with a well-groomed beard.
The second man, who is of similar appearance, is slightly younger, about 5ft 10in (1.78m) tall and was clean-shaven with short, dark hair.
