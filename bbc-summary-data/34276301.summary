Two men, aged 32, are being treated in hospital after two separate shooting incidents in Newry, County Down.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A man called at a house in Sandys Street around midnight and, after an argument, shot the occupant in the leg.
A short time later, another man, was taken from a house at Ardfield Avenue, Warrenpoint, by four masked men and driven to the Armagh Road, Newry, where he was then shot in leg.
Their injuries are not thought to be life threatening.
The Armagh Road has since re-opened.
Supt Simon Walls said: "Our investigation into these incidents is at a very early stage and we are working to identify a motive for the shootings and if they are linked.
"I would appeal for the public's assistance to help us identify and to take those responsible for these attacks off the streets."
