The Reds started third - three points behind leaders Chelsea - but defeated Bristol 3-0, while the Blues lost 2-1 at Manchester City.
Birmingham began the day two points behind Chelsea, but could only draw 2-2 against Notts County.
Goals from Natasha Dowie, Lucy Bronze and a penalty from Fara Williams gave Liverpool victory.
The afternoon had started with Chelsea boosted by the absence from the Manchester City team sheet of several key players, four days ahead of City's Continental Cup final against Arsenal.
And when Birmingham went a goal down inside three minutes, Aileen Whelan heading Notts in front, the prospects for Emma Hayes' team appeared still brighter.
Fiona Sullivan's close-range strike then doubled Notts County's lead as Birmingham began to drift out of the reckoning, but Chelsea's fortunes also took a downward turn when Jill Scott's 24th-minute drive flew into the net for a Man City opener.
Ten minutes later Toni Duggan fired in from 18 yards to double the lead and suddenly Chelsea had to hope that results elsewhere would remain in their favour.
Birmingham pulled a goal back through Kirsty Linnet and were then awarded a penalty two minutes before half-time - but Karen Carney's spot-kick was saved by Carly Telford.
As Carney's shot was being saved, Liverpool were going agonisingly close to taking the lead against Bristol Academy, Bronze heading against the bar - but 10 minutes after the interval they finally got their noses in front, Dowie giving them the lead in Widnes.
By that time however, substitute Hannah Keryakoplis had equalised for Birmingham to put Dave Parker's side back in the hunt.
The Reds doubled their lead when Bronze drilled in a low cross-cross shot, and 20 minutes from time the unlikely title defence looked on as Williams' penalty virtually assured victory and gave a crucial boost to their goal difference.
But even as the Reds' celebrations were going on, Chelsea were putting themselves back in contention thanks to Gilly Flaherty's header.
That left Blues with 19 minutes plus stoppage time to get the goal and point they needed to make sure of taking the title.
The task was made a little easier when City defender Abbie McManus was sent off for elbowing.
But despite piling on the pressure they were unable to force an equaliser and - once full-time was confirmed at Birmingham too - it was Liverpool's former Chelsea manager Matt Beard who ended the season with the biggest smile in the WSL.
