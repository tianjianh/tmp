The song, which features the BBC Concert Orchestra, will be used as the opening sequence for all the BBC's programmes for France 2016.
"It's a fitting tribute to one of France's greatest stars," said Chris Grubb, BBC Football creative lead.
Bizu, 22, has performed at BBC Radio 1's Big Weekend.
She has also recorded sessions at BBC's Maida Vale Studios.
The song will feature in a special Euro 2016 preview show on Wednesday, 8 June on BBC One at 22:45 BST.
But before that you can listen to it on Breakfast on BBC One on Monday from 06:00 BST, while the song will also feature on the BBC iPlayer from Monday.
