Truro City manager Lee Hodges praised his team's battling qualities despite their 2-0 National League South defeat at Chelmsford.

The Cornish side have won only one of their past eight games, and have slumped to 17th in the table.
"If we perform like that, considering we haven't played for weeks, we'll win a lot more than we lose," said Hodges.
"We dillied and dallied and didn't clear our lines, basic defending, and that's cost us a goal."
Truro achieved their best-ever league finish last season, finishing fourth in the fifth tier, but are now just five points above the relegation zone.
However, Hodges remains upbeat about his squad, and especially the performance of new striker Tyler Harvey.
"Tyler came on, he did all right," Hodges told BBC Radio Cornwall. "He's getting back into the swing of things and he worked hard up there.
"I'm disappointed that we got nothing from the game, but there are a lot of positives to take from the battling performance."
