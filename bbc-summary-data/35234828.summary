The 21-year-old joined the Minstermen on loan in November and has made four appearances so far for the League Two strugglers.
"I'm really happy I can finally settle down and know I don't have to go back anywhere," he told the club website.
"I can concentrate on York City now and give my all for the team to help us up the league."
