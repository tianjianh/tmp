[SN]TITLE[SN]
Brighton & Hove Albion 1-2 Newcastle United

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Mohamed Diame and Ayoze Perez scored in the last 10 minutes as Newcastle came from behind to snatch a dramatic victory at Brighton and move back to the top of the Championship.

The Seagulls looked set to open a four-point lead over the Magpies at the top thanks to a penalty from Glenn Murray.
But Diame equalised when Christian Atsu's shot looped up off his boot.
And then Atsu crossed from the left for substitute Perez, who had only come on seven minutes earlier, to fire home.
The victory moves Newcastle two points above Brighton as they attempt to return to the Premier League at the first time of asking.
The Seagulls were fired up for this top-of-the table contest and made a terrific start, camping in the Newcastle half and forcing Karl Darlow into two saves before he was beaten by the spot-kick from Murray.
But the penalty was controversial, with Murray and Ciaran Clark appearing to wrestle each other, but Bobby Madley pointed to the spot.
Soon after, left-back Sebastien Pocognoli was forced off with an injury to be replaced by Chelsea loanee Fikayo Tomori and Newcastle took advantage of the disruption.
They started to dominate possession with Atsu looking dangerous on the right, but failed to really trouble David Stockdale until first-half stoppage time when the Brighton goalkeeper had to deny Matt Ritchie and Atsu.
Although Paul Dummett brilliantly cleared off the line from Lewis Dunk at the start of the second half, Brighton became careless with Yoan Gouffran failing to capitalise on mistakes by Steve Sidwell and Stockwell.
Brighton had their moments but Newcastle looked the more dangerous side, even though they were let down by poor finishing, before they finally broke through.
Newcastle manager Rafael Benitez, involved in some dramatic comebacks during his career, masterminded another one with his two late substitutions.
The first replacement, Daryl Murphy, had already become the latest player to be denied by Stockdale when the Magpies finally equalised with one of the most bizarre goals of the season.
Atsu, who had been a constant menace to Brighton all night, tried his luck from the edge of the area and the ball ricocheted off not one, but two colleagues, Diame being the second, before finding its way into the roof of the net.
A minute later, Benitez threw on Spanish striker Perez for the wasteful Gouffran, and within seven minutes he had hit the winner.
Atsu led the defence on a merry dance once again, after a superb sweeping 60-yard pass from Matt Ritchie, before crossing firmly from the left for Perez to slam home from close range.
Given their next few fixtures, it could be a vital victory for Newcastle as they face every other team in the current top seven in the next few weeks.
They travel to third-placed Huddersfield, who now trail them by eight points, on Saturday and then go to Reading next Tuesday. By the middle of April they also have to face Fulham, Sheffield Wednesday and Leeds.
By contrast, Leeds, Derby and Norwich are the only other sides in the top half of the table who Brighton will face in their remaining 12 games.
The Seagulls are trying to win their first promotion to the top flight since 1982-83 after missing out so cruelly last season. Having been pipped on goal difference by Middlesbrough to finish third, they then lost to Sheffield Wednesday in the play-off semi-finals.
Brighton manager Chris Hughton: "Was it [the equaliser] a sickener? Yes, and I don't think it was a result we deserved.
"I've seen the penalty and there is no doubt Clark has his hands all over him. The referee was in a good position to see it. I think it was a penalty.
"But then it's one of those really unfortunate goals. I wondered at the time how it had gone in.
"But that gives Newcastle momentum going into that last period. I didn't think we were at our best today but I still thought we would go on to win."
Newcastle boss Rafael Benitez: "It was difficult when you play against a good team and with the advantage of goal from penalty that wasn't, it was more difficult.
"Watching the replay of the penalty he was pushing our player. But the reaction of the team was good.
"We were creating chances and you have to be pleased with the performance of everyone, on the pitch and off the bench.
"We created a lot of good situations before we got a little bit lucky. And Ayoze was calm and composed for the winner."
