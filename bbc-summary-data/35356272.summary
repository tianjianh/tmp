[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Further planned strikes by waste collection workers around Bath have been called off.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Bath and North East Somerset (Banes) Council said a pay dispute between the Unite union and the contractor Kier was over following successful talks.
The council said a backlog of waste would be cleared by the weekend.
Only half of scheduled collections have taken place recently due to industrial action over what Unite called a "glaring pay inequality".
