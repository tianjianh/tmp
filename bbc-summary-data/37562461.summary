The 22-year-old Tonga international joined Saints from London Broncos in 2015, having previously played for St George Illawarra Dragons, Melbourne Storm and Cronulla Sharks.
He joins Catalans hooker Eloi Pelissier in agreeing a move to Leigh this week.
"Atelea has been playing really well for St Helens on the edge and in the middle," said head coach Neil Jukes.
"After meeting with him it was evident that Atelea was excited to be part of a club that was growing and what he wanted out of it and what we wanted was the perfect fit."
