With seven minutes remaining Danny Ward's composed finish looked to have given the Millers a consolation goal.
However, Best's two headers rescued an unlikely point for Rotherham.
The Rams had run riot early in the second half with Tom Ince striking twice - first rifling a low shot home before rolling the ball into an empty net - in between Chris Martin's tap-in.
Millers boss Neil Warnock's decision to bring on Republic of Ireland international striker Best with 20 minutes remaining proved to be an inspired one, as the relegation-threatened hosts stay a point adrift of safety.
Best - who was sent off in his first match for the club against Leeds in November - twice headed in at the back post, with his first coming just two minutes after Ward's fourth goal of the season.
Derby struck three times within 10 second-half minutes as a poor headed clearance was collected by Ince, whose brilliant first-time shot gave Lee Camp no chance and nestled in the left corner.
Nice link-up play with Cyrus Christie saw Martin net for the 14th time this season, before the two goalscorers combined as Martin crossed for Ince to net the easiest of goals.
Derby's alarming surrender of their lead cost Darren Wassall's side two vital points in their push for promotion, as they fell four points behind both Hull and Brighton above them with both having games in hand.
Rotherham manager Neil Warnock:
"I can't think of another comeback as good as that, but I forget.
"It's the sweetest because we were playing against a very good team and the players they have got and that's why I am enjoying the challenge.
"They will be going home thinking they have lost the game, you shouldn't concede three goals in the final 10 minutes.
"This is the result of the season, never mind the day. I don't think there will be another one like this.
"We were 3-0 down against Derby County, with the players they have got, and have got a point."
Derby manager Darren Wassall:

"For 82 minutes I thought that was the best we have played all season.
"I asked for a reaction after QPR and we certainly got it. What happened after that was baffling, inexplicable, inexcusable and everybody connected with the football club is absolutely gutted.
"You feel like you have lost. With Rotherham's form we would have taken a point at the start of the game. But at 3-0 after 82 minutes you are expected to win the game.
"We need to work on our game management. We should be going home with all three points and we are going home with one in a very bad frame of mind.
"The fans were right to boo us off. They saw us dominate Rotherham for 80 minutes, we could have been 6-0 up we were that good."
