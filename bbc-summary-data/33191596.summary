Cumbria Police said a 16-year-old boy from Carlisle was questioned but detectives did not believe he was directly involved in the murder.
Two men from Carlisle, aged 18 and 19, remain in custody on suspicion of murder.
Jordan's body was found in Upperby Cemetery in Carlisle on Tuesday.
He died from neck and head wounds caused by a sharp implement, detectives said.
Police are still appealing for witnesses and information about Jordan's whereabouts after he was last seen at 23:00 BST on 15 June at a house near the cemetery.
The cemetery has now reopened.
