Hilltown: Passers-by help to prevent hijacking

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Members of the public have come to the aid of a motorist during an attempted hijacking in County Down overnight.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The man driving the car had been flagged down by two men in Banbridge at about midnight who asked him to take them to the town centre.
The driver agreed but when the men got into his vehicle they threatened him and demanded he take them to Hilltown.
The pair then tried to steal the car in Rathfriland Road, Hilltown, but both fled when passers-by intervened.
A police spokesman said the driver was not physically injured but was left "badly shaken".
