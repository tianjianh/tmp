Conygar pulls out of Haverfordwest cinema complex

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An investment company has pulled out of another development in Pembrokeshire, this time a cinema and retail complex in Haverfordwest.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Conygar had submitted planning applications to build 10 shops, a hotel, multi-screen cinema and restaurants on land at Slade Lane.
But a letter to Pembrokeshire council on 1 June said it wanted to formally withdraw those applications.
Conygar said it was "extremely disappointed" in making the decision.
Earlier this year, the company pulled out of a £100m waterfront development in Pembroke Dock and wrote off its £4.8m investment, saying the project was no longer viable.
In a statement, Conygar said it was "most unfortunate that it has, again, been unable to find common ground with the council on Slade Lane" where it said its plans would "considerably benefit both residents and businesses in Haverfordwest".
It said it had already invested £4m on facilitating the infrastructure at Slade Lade, and remains "committed to delivering a successful development".
This is the second time plans for Slade Lane have fallen through.
Supermarket chain Sainsbury's had planned to build a superstore on the land, bringing 500 jobs, but it pulled out following a review and sold the land to Conygar.
Conygar does still have outline planning permission to build 700 new homes at the site.
Another company is still considering bringing a multi-screen cinema to Haverfordwest.
Fairacre proposes the part demolition and reconfiguration of the Wilko store to provide a multi-screen cinema and four restaurants along the River Cleddau.
That application is yet to be decided.
