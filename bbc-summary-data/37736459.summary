[SN]TITLE[SN]
Leeds United 2-0 Burton Albion

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Goals from Chris Wood and Souleymane Doukara gave Leeds victory against Burton Albion in the Championship.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Leeds had the better of the first half, but the Brewers came closest to opening the scoring when Ben Turner headed Matt Palmer's free-kick against the bar.
Wood put the hosts ahead after the break, firing down the middle from the penalty spot after a trip on Doukara.
And Doukara sealed the win in injury time, slotting in after being picked out by Wood on the counter-attack.
The result ended Burton boss Nigel Clough's perfect record against Leeds, a team he had beaten in all six of his past encounters in his previous role as Derby manager.
The Brewers remain without an away win in the Championship, having been promoted to the second tier of English football for the first time in their history last season.
Leeds were always likely to provide tough opposition in the first-ever meeting between the two sides, with their unbeaten record at home now stretched to five matches.
Garry Monk's side have climbed to ninth in the table, while defeat for Burton sees them slide to 17th.

Leeds head coach Garry Monk:
"It wasn't the best of performances, considering the context of the week we have had. We are not overly happy with the performance but are delighted with the desire to get the win.
"I was pushing the players to put on a good performance but I knew it would be hard after Tuesday night.
"We showed real character and determination to fight to the end. We had to scrap but we knew we would get chances and it was about taking those chances."
Burton Albion manager Nigel Clough:
"That's what it's been like for us away from home, things are just not falling our way.
"Leeds are a good team and this is a very hard place to come. This season is a great learning curve for the players who are learning all the time.
"I thought that we defended and battled well today. We stuck in there for a long time and were very close to getting what would have been a valuable point."
