Rotherham United have signed unattached former West Bromwich Albion and Stoke City striker Peter Odemwingie on a short-term deal until January 2017.

The 35-year-old is Millers boss Kenny Jackett's first signing since taking over the Championship's bottom club on 21 October, replacing Alan Stubbs.
He has also played for Russian side Lokomotiv Moscow, French club Lille and on loan at Bristol City last season.
League One Bolton Wanderers revealed he was training with them on Friday.
But the Bolton News reported that an injury to Wanderers midfielder Tom Thorpe could force the club to seek to sign a midfielder instead of a forward.
Nigeria international Odemwingie, who has also played for Cardiff, last played a competitive match on 19 April.
