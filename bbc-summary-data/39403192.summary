Eddie Bilbey, from Ripley, Derbyshire, died in hospital after competing in an amateur fight at Postmill Centre in South Normanton on Friday.
His step-grandfather, Mike Shinfield, said Eddie's parents were "dazed, confused, distraught" and struggling to come to terms with their loss.
The sport's governing body said it was investigating what happened.
Mr Shinfield, who owns Somercotes Elite Boxing Academy where Eddie was a member, told BBC Radio Derby his step-grandson seemed well in the run up to the fight.
He said Eddie was fit, healthy and there were no concerns relating to his health.
Nottingham Forest Football Club said it "sends its sincere condolences to the family and friends of Eddie", who was a fan of the club.
