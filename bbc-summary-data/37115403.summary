An underweight seal pup has been found washed up on a Jersey beach in what has been described as an "absolute rarity".

The baby mammal was found at Archirondel by a member of the public on Wednesday and tended to by animal rescue teams.
The harbour seal, which is three or four months old, was found to have extreme mouth ulcerations by vets.
British Divers Marine Life Rescue said it would have had difficulty feeding from the mother prior to weaning.
Donna de Gruchy, from the organisation, said harbour seals in Jersey waters were "not unheard of" but there were "minimal numbers".
"You hardly ever see them... they are an absolute rarity. It is a first for me."
Vets are hydrating the seal in Jersey before deciding whether it is well enough to travel to an RSPCA rehabilitation centre.
Ms de Gruchy said RSPCA centres were "overrun" with seal pups which were not surviving and many had the same condition.
