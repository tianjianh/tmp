The Electoral Commission has launched a campaign titled "Don't lose it" to encourage would-be voters to check they are on the official list.
Those who want to take part in the 5 May Scottish Parliament election must be registered by the 18 April deadline.
A report showed that 73,000 entries had been wiped from the register following the introduction of a new system
It also found that, while it was not possible to determine how many of these entries accounted for eligible electors, it is likely that some of the removed entries related to electors who were eligible to remain registered to vote.
The Scottish Parliament election will be the first in which 16 and 17-year-olds can vote.
As part of the campaign a voter information guide is to be sent to every household in Scotland targeting young people and those who have either recently moved house or live in rented accommodation.
Adverts will also be carried on TV, radio and social media.
The commission said its campaign to register voters in the months before last year's UK General Election led to more than 1.5 million additions to the electoral register.
Andy O'Neill, head of the Electoral Commission in Scotland, said: "Our research shows that young people, students, and recent home movers are less likely to be registered to vote.
"If you're not registered by the deadline of April 18 then you won't be able to have your say on issues that directly affect everyone's day-to-day lives in Scotland."
