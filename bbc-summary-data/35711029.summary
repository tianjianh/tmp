OV Lucas, former captain of the RMS Aquitania and RMS Queen Elizabeth, collected the signatures for his daughter Margaret from each voyage.
Elizabeth Taylor and Gregory Peck are among the screen greats who signed the captain's labour of love.
Burt Lancaster and Bette Davis also feature, alongside Field Marshall Montgomery and designer Christian Dior.
Many are penned "to Margaret", Captain Lucas's daughter, who lives in Merseyside.
Adam Partridge Auctioneers & Valuers said Lucas was captain of the ships in in the 50s and early 60s.
"Every time he returned from a trip, he had more autographs for his daughter," said the auctioneers who have rooms in Liverpool and Macclesfield.
Other autographs include Edward, Duke of Windsor and his wife Wallis, former US President Dwight Eisenhower, actors Danny Kaye, Alec Guinness, and David Niven, songwriter Irving Berlin and the writer Somerset Maugham.
