New captain Kyle Coetzer believes this week's two one-day internationals against Pakistan are the beginning of a "new era" for Scotland.

Coetzer leads the Scots for the first time at the Grange on Friday.
"We want to try to take down one of the top sides and we are very capable of doing that," said Coetzer.
"The guys have been preparing well for the last number of years now and things are starting to come together. They have moulded into the squad very well."
Pakistan begin their preparation for the ICC Champions Trophy by facing the Scots on Friday and Sunday.
Spinner Saeed Ajmal will feature for the tourists but all-rounder Shahid Afridi misses out.
"There is a bit in it for both sides here," said Coetzer.
"They are preparing for their tournament and it is nice for the Scottish public to see a team of this calibre coming to the Grange."
And the 29-year-old Northants batsmen expects the first meeting to be "a whirlwind" after
Coetzer made his international bow against Pakistan 10 years ago.
He explained: "I always hoped that somewhere along the line I might be able to do the job [of captain].
"I'm looking forward to the challenges. It's a very proud day.
"I am going to do what is best for the team at all times. Hopefully that can lead to some good results. Effectively, it is a new era and it is exciting times."
Pakistan are in the same section as India, South Africa and West Indies in next month's Champions Trophy, with Dav Whatmore's side playing their group matches at the Oval and Edgbaston.
And captain Misbah-ul-Haq has warned his team-mates not to underestimate Scotland.
"We have an important period coming up with the Champions Trophy," he said. "There are different conditions over here in the UK, different weather, and we need to get used to that.
"We haven't played against Scotland for a long time but in their home conditions, any side can be really tough. So we can't take them lightly."
