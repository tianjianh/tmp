The left-back, 26, has played 126 games for Spurs, scoring nine goals, since signing from Leeds in July 2007.
"Everyone knows the club is going in the right direction. I'm over the moon that I'll stay here until I'm an old man!" he said.
Rose has won eight England caps - making his debut in March's 3-2 win over Germany in Berlin.
He started three of England's four games at Euro 2016, paired with Spurs team-mate Kyle Walker at right-back.
The Doncaster-born player's previous deal at White Hart Lane - signed in July 2014 - was set to expire in 2019.
