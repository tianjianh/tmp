St Johnstone 1-0 Hearts: Tommy Wright sees irony in Saints bookings

St Johnstone manager Tommy Wright saw the irony in having two players booked for simulation against opponents he had accused of going down too easily.

Home strikers Graham Cummins, scorer of the game's only goal, and Chris Kane were the offenders against Hearts.
"It's not something I want, but it's quite ironic that it happens this week," Wright told BBC Scotland.
"If I think that the referee is spot on, the players will be fined. That's what we do here."
Hearts had Jamie Walker banned for diving against Celtic earlier in the season.
And last week Sam Nicholson won a penalty against Hamilton Accies and also successfully appealed against a booking for simulation received by Tony Watt.
Wright had said ahead of the arrival of the side sitting second in the Scottish Premiership that he would be working on his side "being disciplined in the final third" and that "certain teams and players go down too easily".
"We've won 1-0 and won 2-0 in the simulation stakes," he joked after the game against Hearts.
"I'll look at it. I've seen Graham Cummins, I've spoken to the referee about it.
"He said there is contact but he exaggerated the contact on him.
"We'll take it on the chin and the players will have to take it on the chin."
Hearts head coach Robbie Neilson had insisted before the game that his players won a higher share of awards because they were an attacking side.
"I'll stay quiet about this," he told BBC Scotland after the defeat by St Johnstone. "I don't like doing my talking in the media.
"It is up to other people to deal with their teams."
Neilson was ordered from the field of play during the second half at McDiarmid Park.
"I got sent to the stand for clapping a delivery into the box that I thought was really good," he insisted.
"The fourth official thought I was clapping sarcastically at the referee, so I think he's got his wires crossed a wee bit and saw something different to what happened.
"There was no swearing, there was no shouting, but's that's football - you'll have days when you clap a delivery and they'll pat you on the back and days when they'll put you to the stand.
"It was actually the fourth official - the referee had nothing to do with it."
