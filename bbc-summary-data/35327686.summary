Huddersfield could lose its Accident and Emergency department in proposed plans for an NHS shake-up.

Huddersfield Royal Infirmary could also be demolished for a new hospital in the town, a report has revealed.
The report's "preferred option" would see Calderdale Royal Hospital in Halifax keep its emergency services.
The proposal means people in Huddersfield could have to travel to Halifax, Wakefield, or Barnsley for emergency treatment.
Barry Sheerman, the Labour MP for Huddersfield has said he was "deeply concerned".
"A town the size of Huddersfield requires and deserves A & E services, and I will continue to fight tooth and nail to ensure that it does" he said.
A new hospital, without an A&E department, would be built in Acre Mill in Huddersfield, under the plans.
The Clinical Commissioning Group for Greater Huddersfield and Calderdale both said no final decision has been made and a public meeting is to be held on Wednesday.
Current hospital services in both areas weren't sustainable and the emergency hospital in Halifax provided the best financial forecast.
Jason McCartney, Conservative MP for Colne Valley said "narrow financial concerns" should not be the priority.
Mr Sheerman said he believed debt problems were behind the decision.
"The Halifax Trust has got into so many problems and we've always bailed them out" he said.
"Public Finance Initiative is at the heart of this and the decision to keep Halifax is because they have to maximise use of it to pay off their debt."
He said the "mini hospital" being built in Huddersfield was "just compensation".
