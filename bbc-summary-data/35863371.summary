Fox-Pitt, 47, has entered the Burnham Market trials with four horses.
"It is all systems go here and everything is on target," he said. "I hope to be competing soon."
The three-time Olympic medallist was placed in an induced coma after falling at the World Young Horse Championships in Lion-D'Angers on 17 October.
Fox-Pitt revealed in December he had started riding again.
Among the horses he hopes to make his comeback on at Burnham Market - which takes place from 1-3 April - is 2015 Badminton winner Chilli Morning.
Fox-Pitt is Britain's most successful rider, with 20 major championship medals.
