Chris Morgan 'like a new signing' after returning to Cornish Pirates from injury

Cornish Pirates coach Gavin Cattle says the return of captain Chris Morgan from a injury is like having a new player.

The 35-year-old dislocated his shoulder in the opening minutes of the second game of last season, and has not played a competitive game since.
"It's like having a new signing," Cattle told BBC Radio Cornwall ahead of the opening Championship game of the season at Bedford.
"To bring somebody with his wealth of experience in is a big boost."
During his year on the sidelines, back-row Morgan has assisted the club's coaching team, which has been whittled down to just backs expert Cattle and forwards coach Alan Paver, after Ian Davies left the club because of financial constraints.
"He's had a massive input not just on the playing side of things over the years, he's also been a big asset to the coaching team as well," added Cattle.
"Myself and Paves played with him for a number of years and he holds knowledge in different areas that we don't.
"His input not just as a captain, but as a member of the coaching team you could say, has been very good this pre-season."
