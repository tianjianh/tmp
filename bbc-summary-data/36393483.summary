EU referendum: Salmond rejects Remain 'scaremongering'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Remain campaigner Alex Salmond has rejected "scaremongering" by the Treasury to support the Remain side, in the first BBC EU debate.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The former SNP leader told young voters in Glasgow that he wanted to "get a bit of idealism into the debate".
Voters aged 18 to 29 have asked about job prospects and house prices should the UK vote to leave the EU on 23 June.
UKIP's Diane James said staying in the EU meant young people were competing with thousands of Europeans for jobs.
Other panellists in the hour-long debate - entitled How Should I Vote? - are Labour's Alan Johnson, who backs staying in the EU while Conservative Liam Fox argues for exit.
Former SNP leader Mr Salmond said he did not buy into some of the "scaremongering" stuff put out by the Remain side,  but he adds: "It wouldn't be economic Apocalypse if we left the EU but there's more jobs and more choices if we stay in."
He added: "That's not the way to conduct referendum campaigns ... The remain campaign can't afford to lose 1% a month, otherwise they will lose. To win a campaign to motivate people you have got to argue a positive case."
Some of the young voters taking part criticised "tit for tat" attacks during the campaign, describing it as "petty name calling" and saying it was no wonder people did not know which way to vote.
UKIP's Ms James did not accept that some in the Leave side's focus on immigration had been "appalling". She said there had been a focus on migration "on the basis that that's one very clear example that the UK government .. actually don't have control over a key aspect of our economy".
Asked whether travel across Europe would be affected by a vote to leave, the Conservative former defence secretary Mr Fox said: "Europe and exchange and trade and travel existed before there was a European Union and will continue after."
But Mr Johnson said: "There are 2.5m tourists who come to Scotland every year. How are we going to differentiate between the Polish plumber and the Polish tourist? It means surely, a system of visas."
Mr Fox disagreed saying it was "not beyond the wit of man" to allow free travel for tourists but demand visas for those who wanted to work.
Asked whether visas would be required for European travel in the event of a Brexit vote, Ms James said: "We just don't know". She said the PM should have identified that sort of detail already but had not published a "Plan B".
You can watch the debate live on BBC 1 and listen in on BBC Radio 5Live.
Earlier this evening, the BBC's Christian Fraser was live on the BBC News Facebook page from the debate venue in Glasgow, answering questions alongside some of the young voters taking part.
