Queen of the South host Championship rivals Dundee United in the other last-four tie, with the games to be played on the weekend of 18/19 February.
This is the first season when the competition has included guest sides from Wales and Northern Ireland.
TNS, who lead the Welsh Premier League by 12 points, beat Scottish League One leaders Livingston in the last eight.
Before that, they beat League Two leaders Forfar Athletic in the previous round.
St Mirren, who won the Challenge Cup in 2006, are five points adrift at the foot of the Championship but edged out league rivals Ayr United in the quarter-finals.
Queen of the South, who sit sixth in the Championship, beat League One side Alloa Athletic to end a run of four straight defeats that led to the departure of manager Gavin Skelton.
The Englishman's last game in charge was a 4-1 thumping by second-top United, who defeated Dunfermline Athletic to reach the last four and extend their own winning run to seven games.
Queens have lifted the Challenge Cup twice, in 2003 and 2013, and also been runners-up twice.
United have only been in the final once, losing to Stenhousemuir in 1996.
This season's final is on the weekend of 25/26 March.
