The Canadian side, who began their debut season in the English league for 2017, already have ex-New Zealand front-rower Fuifui Moimoi in the squad.
Bailey, 32, has been without a club since leaving Warrington at the end of 2016, having made 15 appearances.
"It feels great to be back playing and continuing my career," Bailey said.
"I've been out of the game since the Grand Final last year, but I've kept myself fit."
Leeds-born Bailey won six Super League Grand Finals in 12 years at his hometown club, as well as three World Club Challenge titles and a Challenge Cup.
Wolfpack director of rugby Brian Noble selected Bailey for Great Britain during the 2004 Tri-Nations.
He joins a Toronto side already featuring extensive top-flight experience in players such as Craig Hall, Richard Whiting and Andrew Dixon.
Toronto are one of four clubs to have won their first three games of the League One season.
