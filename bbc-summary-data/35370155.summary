A network cable linking the Channel Islands with the UK was severed after a ship dropped anchor in bad weather.

Jersey States-owned telecom company JT said customers would not have noticed a change as services were diverted to other cables in the network.
It took seven days to repair the cable, with 800m (2,500ft) cut out using remote controlled underwater equipment from a specialist ship.
The ship also recovered the anchor that caused the damage.
JT's Chief Operations and Technology Officer, Dave Newbold, said: "Incidents like this are thankfully very rare indeed.
"When they do happen, they underline exactly why we invest millions of pounds to install, and then maintain, a network of high-speed, high-capacity communications cables."
