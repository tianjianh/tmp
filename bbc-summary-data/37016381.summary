Che Adams: Birmingham City sign Sheffield United striker

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Birmingham City have signed Sheffield United striker Che Adams for an undisclosed fee.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 20-year-old, who scored 15 goals in 55 appearances for the Blades after moving from non-league Ilkeston, has agreed a three-year deal with Blues.
Birmingham had two previous bids turned down for Adams, who made his last Blades appearance as a substitute in Saturday's 1-0 defeat at Bolton.
But he has now signed to become manager Gary Rowett's third summer signing.
Adams, who has played for England at Under-20 level, will not be available for Tuesday's EFL Cup first-round tie at home to Oxford United.
