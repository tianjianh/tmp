[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Struggling St Mirren lost more ground at the foot of the Championship, with Nicky Clark's first-half goal earning Dunfermline victory in Paisley.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Clark drilled in a shot on 26 minutes after Lee Ashcroft's effort had been blocked following a free kick.
The win lifts Dunfermline up to eighth place, while the hosts are still seeking a league win this season.
The Pars almost snatched a second goal on the break when Michael Moffat struck a post in stoppage time.
It was Dunfermline's first league win since beating the Buddies in September, but again the home side will be wondering how they did not win a match in which they created the bulk of the chances.
The defeat leaves St Mirren seven points adrift of Dumbarton.
The last time the teams met in the Saturday evening game they conjured up seven goals and it looked like they might deliver another cracker after a brisk opening.
Jason Naismith had a shot well saved by Sean Murdoch in the visitors' goal inside four minutes, then Lewis Morgan nodded just wide before Clark tested Saints keeper Scott Gallacher with a header.
Clark then put Dunfermline ahead with his fifth goal of the season, the striker providing a clinical finish in the box after some poor defending provided him with the opportunity.
Kyle McAllister saw a good effort saved by Murdoch before the Dunfermline keeper produced a sensational stop from a flashing David Clarkson header right on half time to preserve the narrow interval lead.
Saints continued to press after the break and Stevie Mallan brought out another good save from Murdoch before Clark should really have put Dunfermline further ahead but Gallacher did well to block the striker's effort.
Referee Nick Walsh was attracting the wrath of the home support as the game became tense and he lectured both Saints boss, Jack Ross and Pars assistant, Sandy Clark, for a row in the technical area after yet another contentious decision. Both men continued their bickering at the final whistle.
John Sutton should really have done better after Murdoch spilled a 70 minute Lewis Morgan effort but time and time again the home side just could not convert the chances they made despite throwing Tom Walsh and Lawrence Shankland on as second half substitutes.
Moffat hit the woodwork in the dying seconds when a counter-attack caught the hosts short but there was no time for St Mirren to benefit from the reprieve.
St Mirren manager Jack Ross: "The goal we conceded was poor and while we did not play particularly well in the first 30 minutes or so, we did much better after that.
"But we need to be much more ruthless when the chances come our way and although Sean Murdoch had some good saves we probably did not do enough to win the game, but could easily have got something out of it.
"The performance levels in the last three home matches have improved. We just need to finish the chances we make to make some real progress."
Dunfermline boss Allan Johnston: "I'm delighted to get our first away league win of the season and it is nice to dig one out in terms of a result for a change.
"St Mirren put us under a lot of pressure in the second half and the players deserve a lot of credit for showing character as in big games, big players step up and ours did that tonight.
"But it is only one game and one result and we now need to put a strong run of those together to get up the table. I'm confident we can do that."
