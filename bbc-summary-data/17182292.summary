An unlicensed female sanitary drug which has a hallucinogenic effect if misused has been seized in raids on Polish shops in Southampton.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Tantum Rosa is an anti-inflammatory medicine manufactured in Poland.
The raids by health officials, thought to be the UK's first for the product, followed police reports of teenagers allegedly high on the drug vandalising a local cemetery.
Southampton Trading Standards said the medicine was safe if used correctly.
But it was not licensed for sale in the UK.
Danio Polish Shop, in St Mary's Road, Southampton, had been found selling Tantum Rosa by the police, Trading Standards and the government's Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).
Other shops visited were told to remove other medical products.
Hampshire Constabulary called the operation "a success".
Southampton resident Ella Porawska, from Poland, said she was "shocked" Tantum Rosa, a soluble powder, was being misused by teenagers.
She said: "I was really surprised that somebody can sell them these products."
Danny Lee-Frost, from the MHRA, said he was "concerned" the medicine was being used as a recreational drug.
He said: "Because it is labelled in Polish, people who get hold of it won't be aware of what the ingredients are if they do attempt to misuse it."
He added: "We'd like to see this product removed from all shelves in the UK and this is the first step in our efforts in doing that."
Police said shopkeepers found selling the product could face prosecution.
