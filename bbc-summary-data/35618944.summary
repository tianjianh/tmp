Millwall went ahead when Steve Morison lobbed Thorsten Stuckmann from outside the box after Paul Keegan's error.
Rovers levelled when Richard Chaplow slotted home Andy Williams' cross against his former club.
Doncaster forced the pace in the second half, but Lynden Gooch headed just wide while visiting keeper Jordan Archer denied Nathan Tyson and Conor Grant.

"Getting ourselves in front, we're a little disappointed that we didn't win the game.
"Looking back and having seen the results in the division it's probably a point gained.
"Excluding the goal they didn't really cause us any problems. They only really caused us a problem in the last 10 minutes when we made individual errors."
