A UK holidaymaker was mistakenly issued with a five-figure mobile phone bill within 24-hours of travelling abroad.

Sean Owen, from Basildon, Essex, had checked with his service provider O2 he had the correct package before he left for Turkey.
However, he received a message saying he owed a total of £20,799 while on his second day away.
O2 has apologised for the error and said the unbilled charges would be removed from Mr Owen's account.

The 34 year old said his phone bill was £22 before he went abroad with his fiancée but the next day it had risen to more than £16,000. The bill later rose to more than £17,000 plus VAT.
"It's been worrying and has ruined the holiday to a degree," Mr Owen said.
"I've tried to put it to the back of my mind and enjoy the holiday but in the back of your mind it's still sitting there.
"You're thinking it could ruin your credit report, everything, if this goes badly."
O2 confirmed Mr Owen had a package called O2 Travel on his account.
The package should have entitled Mr Owen to unlimited data, 120 minutes and 120 minutes for a fixed charge of £3.99 a day.
A spokesman for O2 said: "We are in the process of removing the unbilled charges.
"Incidents like this are rare and when he contacted us, we explained we would carry out an investigation into how this happened.
"We have now removed any bars on Mr Owen's account and we will be contacting him as soon as possible to apologise for any inconvenience."
