The 20-year-old has played two first-team games for the Royals since coming through their youth system - his most recent as a substitute against Huddersfield in this year's FA Cup.
Former England Under-19 international Samuel has previously had loan spells at Colchester and Dagenham.
"Dominic will bring pace to our forward line," said boss Steven Pressley.
The Sky Blues also have Bolton Wanderers forward Sanmi Odelusi, 21, training with them, with a view to a loan move.
Pressley also has a decision to make over 24-year-old striker Gary Madine, whose loan deal from Sheffield Wednesday expires on Friday.
Madine has scored four goals in 13 appearances for the Sky Blues since joining in November.
