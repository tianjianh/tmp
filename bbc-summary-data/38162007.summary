Bonhams said it was a new world record for the artist, surpassing the previous figure of £31,000 set at the auctioneers in 2002.
The work, called "A Scottish Triptych: Nightshift, Departure, Saturdays", depicts Glasgow in the 1980s.
It has been exhibited in Glasgow, Berlin and San Francisco, where it was bought by the exhibition's organiser.
The painting has been in California ever since.
Bonhams head of Scottish art Chris Brickley said: "A Scottish Triptych: Nightshift, Departure, Saturdays is an astonishing work of great depth by one of Scotland's greatest living painters.
"There was a lot of pre-sale interest in this piece and I'm not surprised that it was sold for such a high price."
The auctioneers said the three panelled picture, or tryptych, was one of the most significant Scottish post-war figurative artworks to have come onto the market in recent years.
Ken Currie was born in 1960 and graduated from the Glasgow School of Art in 1983. He is one of the generation of artists known as the New Glasgow Boys.
