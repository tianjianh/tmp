[SN]TITLE[SN]
Wheelie bin murder: Pair guilty of killing Owen Creaney

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Two people accused of killing a County Armagh man and putting his body in a wheelie bin have been found guilty of murder.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The jury found Stephen Hughes, 29, and Shaunean Boyle, 25, guilty of punching, kicking and stamping on Owen Creaney in July 2014.
Mr Creaney, from Lurgan, died two days after the attack.
It took the jury just over five hours to reach a verdict after five weeks of evidence.
Both have received automatic life sentences.
A hearing to decide on the minimum time they will spend in prison before being considered for parole will take place on 18 November.
Hughes, with an address at Maghaberry Prison, and Boyle, of Edenderry Park, Banbridge, washed and changed Mr Creaney after the attack and put him in an upstairs room of a house.
After he died, Hughes and Boyle put Mr Creaney's body in a wheelie bin at the house in Moyraverty Court in Craigavon, County Armagh, where he was found by police.
As the verdicts were announced, Hughes stared straight ahead, while Boyle broke down in tears.
Before being led away, Boyle spoke to Hughes for the first time since the case commenced.
She turned to him and said: "look at what you have done". And as they were both being led away in handcuffs, she said to Hughes: "Have you no conscience on you at all?"
