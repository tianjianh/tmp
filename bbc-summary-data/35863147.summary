The court heard how Tomlinson, of Riverdale Road in Shrewsbury, filmed himself having sex with a dog.
Still images and video footage of abuse was found on his mobile phone.
As well as a custodial sentence he was handed an extended licence period of four years and eight months, placed on the sex offenders register for life and banned from working with children.
Steve Cullen, temporary assistant chief constable at West Mercia Police, said: "He has violated the trust that both the public and his colleagues placed in him in the most heinous of ways."
