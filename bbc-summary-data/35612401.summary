Team spirit at League One strugglers Crewe Alexandra is a good as it has ever been over the last few years, according to defender Jon Guthrie.

Guthrie, 23, has been at the Alex since August 2012 and says confidence is high after going six games unbeaten.
"Since I've been here, this is probably the tightest squad we've have here," Guthrie told BBC Radio Stoke.
"Everyone gets on and we're all in it together which is what you need in a relegation fight."
Crewe's revival in form has brought them right back into the scrap to stay in League One, with the Alex only three points from safety, in 22nd place, ahead of Saturday's crucial trip to Chesterfield, who are just above the drop zone.
"We're positive going into games at the moment," left-back Guthrie added.
"You always want to prove people wrong, especially when they say you're not good enough."
The Railwaymen's spirit was evident in Tuesday's game at Rochdale when they fought back from 2-0 down to claim a valuable point.
And now they have a chance to go level on points with the Spireites.
"We've got to win against the teams that are down there and these games are massive for us," Guthrie continued.
"If we can pick up points we're going to get out of it sooner or later."
