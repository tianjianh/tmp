[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 36-year-old former Crystal Palace and Birmingham City forward scored twice in 25 appearances in 2015-16.
Midfielders Manny Oyeleke, 23, and Jason Pope, 20, and striker Will Hoskins, 30, have also been let go.
Craig Woodman, David Noble, Christian Ribeiro, Jamie McAllister, Arron Davies and Alex Nicholls have yet to be offered new contracts by the Grecians.
But Matt Jay and Joe Charles have both been offered fresh deals, while academy graduates Toby Down, Jordan Storey, Nick Grimes and Kyle Egan have all been added to the first-team squad.
Defender Danny Butterfield and midfielder Matt Oakley have been given support staff positions, but may still be registered as players to provide backup.
