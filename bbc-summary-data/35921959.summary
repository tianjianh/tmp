[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Northern Ireland Water has said it will freeze charges for the vast majority of its 80,000 business customers this year.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The company said the move was testament to their "continued efficiency".
However, about 500 non-domestic customers will see a 2.8% rise in trade effluent charges from April.
The news comes after water charges rose by 2.4% last year due to a big increase in Northern Ireland Water's own rates bill.
Northern Ireland Water reviews its tariffs for water and sewerage services annually and agrees them with the Utility Regulator.
Businesses and farms pay bills, with the majority, around 70,000, being metered for their water use and sewerage services.
The company's finance director Ronan Larkin said the upcoming freeze in prices was "excellent news for local businesses who continue to trade in difficult circumstances".
