A prominent dissident republican activist has been remanded in custody charged in connection with comments he allegedly made at an Easter Sunday republican commemoration.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Damien 'Dee' Fennell, 33, from the Ardoyne area of north Belfast, is accused of encouraging people to commit acts of terrorism.
He is also accused of supporting a proscribed organisation.
It follows a speech he gave in Lurgan, County Armagh, earlier this month.
A detective sergeant told Craigavon Magistrates Court that he believed he could connect the accused to the charges.
Mr Fennell spoke only one word during the brief appearance, replying "yes" when asked if he understood the charges.
His solicitor said a bail application would be made at his client's next appearance.
He was remanded in custody to appear again via video link on 1 May.
