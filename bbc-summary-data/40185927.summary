The private service in Tadcaster was attended by serving police officers and former colleagues.

The officer, who was married and had a young son, had only been with North Yorkshire Police for eight months at the time of the shooting.
His patrol partner, PC Sandy Kelly, was also shot and injured but recovered.
Magee was released from prison in 2000 as part of the Good Friday Agreement.
North Yorkshire's Chief Constable, Dave Jones, said: "Glenn's death was a dark and tragic moment in the history of North Yorkshire Police and he will never be forgotten.
"Glenn was volunteering to help protect his local community when he - and his family - paid the ultimate price.
"Today, there are thousands of others on duty across the UK, facing similar dangers every day who all deserve our support and respect."
Mr Jones added the force's thoughts remained with Mr Goodman's family and friends.
