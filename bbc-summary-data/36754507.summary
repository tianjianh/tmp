Multi-screen cinema and restaurant plans for Haverfordwest

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A multi-screen cinema and restaurant complex could be built in a Pembrokeshire town.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A planning application has been lodged with Pembrokeshire council for the development to be built on land at Slade Lane in Haverfordwest.
The site was previously earmarked for a Sainsbury's superstore, but the supermarket pulled out last year, saying it was "no longer viable".
Developers Conygar has proposed a five-screen cinema and five restaurants.
The site would also include a 168-space car park, with access off the new roundabout on Thomas Parry Way.
