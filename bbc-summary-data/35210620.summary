The fire broke out at Coed Eva Primary School in Cwmbran, Torfaen, at about 02:25 GMT on New Year's Day.
The four were arrested on Friday and have been bailed pending further inquiries.
A joint criminal investigation is being carried out by Gwent Police and South Wales Fire and Rescue Service to determine the cause of the fire.
Ten fire crews battled for three hours to bring the blaze under control and stop it spreading to the adjoining juniors' building.
On Saturday, more than Â£2,000 had been pledged online to help pay for school supplies.
Parent Cerri Loder, 27, who set up the fundraising page with the help of other mothers, said she was "overwhelmed" by the donations.
"My daughter is in year one at the school and myself and other mums were all at the gates breaking down in tears. It's tragic," she explained.
"Any money we can raise will help the children get back to school, and normality, as soon as possible."
The school teaches more than 500 pupils, including 200 in the infants and nursery section.
Kelly Steer, who has a daughter at the school, said parents had been left "speechless".
"It's a fantastic school and now we have to worry about the children being relocated and split up," she added.
Head teacher Gill Ellis said they were devastated and would do all they could to get the school up and running again
