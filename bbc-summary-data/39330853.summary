Broadmoor Hospital patients asked for feedback

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Psychiatric patients detained at Broadmoor are being asked for feedback on their care by an independent watchdog.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
It is the first time the high-security facility has invited watchdog Healthwatch to speak to its residents.
They will be asked for their views on a range of healthcare issues, including GP services and dentistry.
West London Mental Health NHS Trust, which runs the unit, said it was a "groundbreaking initiative".
The announcement came after the hospital, based in Crowthorne and home to some of the UK's most notorious killers, was issued with a Care Quality Commission warning notice in December.
Carolyn Regan, chief executive of the trust, said receiving patient feedback was "crucial to ensuring we are providing a responsive and high-quality service".
She said: "Having an external independent organisation such as Healthwatch listen to patient feedback is even more valuable."
Mark Sanders, of Healthwatch Bracknell Forest, said: "Patients within a high secure forensic hospital should have as much say about the services they receive as any other patient.
"We are happy to be able to support that voice for patients and feedback to West London Mental Health NHS Trust to improve the services and environment offered."
