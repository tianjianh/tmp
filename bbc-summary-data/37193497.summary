The 28-year-old Italian, who joined the Black Cats from Arsenal in 2013, was injured during a training session.
Manager David Moyes said he would "definitely" look to make a signing as Jordan Pickford, 22, is his only fit senior goalkeeper.
Moyes added the club had made a bid for Sevilla midfielder Vicente Iborra.
The 28-year-old joined Sevilla from Levante in 2013 and is a three-time Europa League winner.
Moyes said Mannone's injury gives Pickford "the chance to show what he can do".
He added: "He has a big future ahead of him."
The England Under-21 international is a product of the Sunderland academy and has played for a host of clubs on loan.
He made his senior debut for the Black Cats in an FA Cup tie at Arsenal last season, before making two Premier League appearances.
