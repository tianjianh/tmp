Six people have been arrested in Canada on suspicion of running a prostitution ring, which smuggled nearly 500 women in to the country, according to police.

The majority of the alleged victims are from China and South Korea, the police say.
They believe the women were brought to Canada by a criminal gang and were forced into prostitution in a number of cities, including Montreal and Toronto.
Detectives are hunting two more suspects in connection with the case.
They are also examining data from computers and mobile phones seized during the operation, in the hope of identifying the victims and their clients.
Police said the women illegally entered Canada through the land border with the United States or airports, sometimes using visas "obtained through false pretences".
They then spent several weeks or months at a time in brothels located in cities throughout the country.
