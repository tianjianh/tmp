Lawro's Premier League predictions v Robbie Williams

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
BBC Sport's football expert Mark Lawrenson will be making a prediction for all 380 Premier League games this season against a variety of guests.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Lawro's opponent for this week's fixtures is Robbie Williams.
The former Take That star will be performing at the BBC Music Awards on Monday.
Williams says he has read Lawro's predictions - and made his own - for years and claims he has always "battered him".
They have officially gone head to head twice before, however, and Lawro has won on both occasions - on one occasion winning a side bet for some Take That tickets in the process.
You can make your Premier League predictions now, compare them with those of Lawro, Robbie and other fans, and try to take your team to the top of the leaderboard by playing the BBC Sport Predictor game.
Williams is a Port Vale fan and he grew up worshipping a host of 1980s Vale stars - and Manchester United midfielder Bryan Robson.
"I loved Bryan because he was Captain Marvel," he told BBC Sport. "I did Soccer Aid with him one year too and I was captain of the team and, as we were leaving the dressing room to go out on to the pitch, I thought I'd give them a big manly shout of 'C'mon boys!'.
"But before I could do that, Bryan did a shout of his own. He was on my side, he is my mate and he likes me - and I was terrified of him with this kind of roar that he did, which was primal.
"I remember looking at him, thinking that is why you were captain of England and the player that you were."
"The best player I played against in Soccer Aid was Diego Maradona.
"Myself and Good Morning Britain presenter Ben Shephard were next to each other and Maradona was coming straight at us. I shouted: "Sheps, Maradona left shoulder."
"It was another surreal moment in my life - I am on the pitch at Old Trafford, representing England in front of 76,000 and up against Maradona as he is bearing down on goal, and I am telling Ben Shephard to stop him."
A correct result (picking a win, draw or defeat) is worth 10 points. The exact score earns 40 points.
Last week, Lawro got seven correct results, including two perfect scores, from 10 Premier League matches. That gave him a total of 130 points, his second-highest score of the season.
But it was not enough to beat comedian Tim Vine, who also got seven correct results with two perfect scores, for a total of 130 points that leaves him second on our guest leaderboard.
All kick-offs 15:00 GMT unless otherwise stated.

Match report
Chelsea 1-0 West Brom
Lawro's prediction: 2-0
Robbie's prediction: Chelsea are flying - in attack they are a real force and, defensively, they are really solid too. I don't see West Brom having much luck at Stamford Bridge. 3-0
Match report
Man Utd 1-0 Tottenham
Lawro's prediction: 1-1
Robbie's prediction: United have dropped so many points recently by conceding really sloppy late goals. There is a lack of confidence around Old Trafford right now. Tottenham are scoring goals again and their defence is always tight so this is going to be tough, but I think United will edge it. 1-0
Match report
Southampton 1-0 Middlesbrough
Lawro's prediction: 1-1
Robbie's prediction: Southampton lost at Palace last week but it was a bit of a freak result. Saints have a very strong backline that they will probably be losing half of in the January transfer market - good luck to them replacing them again, but they seem to do it season after season. 2-0
Match report
Liverpool 2-2 West Ham
Lawro's prediction: 2-0
Robbie's prediction: I would like West Ham boss Slaven Bilic to do well because he is the rock 'n' roll manager but I think Liverpool are just going to have too much for them. Divock Origi to get a brace. 3-1
Match report
Lawro was speaking to BBC Sport's Chris Bevan.
Lawro's best score: 140 points (week three v Laura Trott)
Lawro's worst score: 30 points (week four v Dave Bautista)
