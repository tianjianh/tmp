MPs 'will get say' on Brexit legislation, says Scottish Conservative MSP

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
MPs will get to have a say on the terms of Brexit negotiations, the Scottish Conservatives' constitution spokesman has told BBC Scotland.

It follows reports that MPs from across the political spectrum want a Commons vote on the issue.
Prof Adam Tomkins said parliament, not the government, will legislate for what replaces the European Communities Act.
The SNP's Europe spokesman Stephen Gethins said both the Scottish and UK parliament should have a vote.
The UK government intends to trigger Article 50 by the end of March 2017.
Article 50 is the official process for exiting the EU and could take up to two years.
At the Conservative Party conference last week, Prime Minister Theresa May said the government would strike a deal with the EU as a "sovereign, independent" UK but her speech raised concerns among some that the UK is headed for a "hard Brexit" - without unfettered access to the single market.
She also gave details of a "Great Repeal Bill" which will scrap the European Communities Act which took Britain into the 1970s, and enshrine all existing EU law into British law.
There have been reports of a cross-party move, including Labour's Ed Miliband and Lib Dem Nick Clegg, to seek a stronger role for the Commons on Brexit.
Speaking on the BBC's Sunday Politics Scotland programme, Scottish Conservative MSP Mr Tomkins, said: "I don't understand where that concern comes from, frankly.
"The prime minister made it perfectly plain in her first conference speech that there is going to be a Great Repeal Bill, as she calls it, that will repeal the European Communities Act 1972, which is the legal instrument that took us in to the European Union in the first place in the 1970s.
"Now, only parliament can repeal legislation. The prime minister can't do that. The government can't do that."
Asked if MPs would actually be able to vote on the terms of Brexit negotiations, Mr Tomkins added:  "I think that repealing the European Communities Act will require parliament to have its say over what replaces the European Communities Act once it is repealed. That's the nature of legislation.
"Let me be absolutely clear about this, because it's a very elementary constitutional point. Only parliament can repeal parliament's legislation.
"The government can't do that and when parliament repeals its legislation it will be parliament that legislates for what replaces the European Communities Act, not Theresa May."
It has been reported that Mrs May is against holding a Parliamentary vote on the terms of Brexit negotiations. She has said MPs should be informed "at various stages" but told the BBC last week the government had to be able to negotiate but be sure that "we don't set out all the cards in our negotiation".
Last week the Scottish government's Brexit minister Mike Russell warned the Scottish Parliament might seek to block the "Great Repeal Bill" if Scotland's interests were not represented in negotiations.
Appearing on the Sunday Politics Scotland programme, SNP MSP Mr Gethins was asked if his party would be demanding that parliament be given the right to decide on the "type" of Brexit the UK chooses.
He said: "I think parliament should have a vote, both the Scottish Parliament and the UK Parliament.
"There has to be full parliamentary scrutiny. I've already put down an urgent question seeking Theresa May or the Brexit Secretary to come to the House tomorrow to talk about the triggering of Article 50."
Mr Gethins called on the UK government to provide more details about what Brexit will mean.
"We've had no answers on the single-market, no answers on EU nationals," he said.
"We are still waiting for details. Our European partners don't know what the UK government is planning to do next. They have had three-and-a-half months on this.
"We have had nothing from the UK government. They can't even tell us if they have the objective of remaining part of the single market."
