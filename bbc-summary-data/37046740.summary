Is the #RioProblems hashtag a fair reflection of #Rio2016?

Spectators at the Games and on TV have taken to Twitter to highlight what they see as shortcomings at the Rio Olympics, using the hashtag #RioProblems.

A number of issues have emerged in the first week of the sporting showpiece, including the green diving pool, empty seats at venues and a shortage of food for hungry fans, prompting people to air their grievances online. But is it a fair reflection of what is happening in Brazil?
The hashtag peaked on Monday, with thousands sharing video of alleged muggings on the streets of Rio during the Olympics, although it has not been independently verified as taking place over the past week.
#RioProblems has also accompanied other issues at the host venues, such as the wrong national anthem being played ahead of the Nigerian men's football fixture against Japan.
It has also been accompanied by several Twitter accounts set up under the same name, although they all appear to have been set up before the Games, with some registered as early as two years ago, perhaps in anticipation of issues arising at South America's first Olympics.
Journalists have used the hashtag to highlight the issues affecting them in the media bubble, from late courtesy buses to coffee shortages.
The sign in this tweet translates as: "Due to technical issues, we suspend the coffee service in this refreshment station. We apologise for any inconvenience."
Meanwhile, others spotted an easy opportunity for a joke.
