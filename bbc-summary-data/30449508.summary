Joint funded by the UK and Welsh governments, the station is located on the Ebbw Vale to Cardiff line in the Bassaleg area of Newport.
Served by the existing hourly service, the single platform station has ticket machines, information screens, car parking and CCTV.
The first train from Ebbw Vale arrived at Pye Court 09:15 GMT on Sunday.
Welsh transport minister Edwina Hart said: "I want to ensure people have access to the efficient and comfortable public transport services they need.
"Together with the new Ebbw Vale Town station, which is opening soon, Pye Corner will improve access to jobs and services for many people along this busy route."
