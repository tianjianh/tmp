Ken Skates said the A55 study would consider all aspects of the road and complement existing improvement plans.
He said more than 70,000 cars use sections of the road at peak times and the first stage of the research was intended to be done by late summer.
The A55 runs from Holyhead on Anglesey to Post House roundabout, near Chester.
