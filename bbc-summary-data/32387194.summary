Graham Dwyer, 42, from Foxrock in south Dublin, had denied the murder of Elaine O'Hara but was convicted by unanimous verdict at the Central Criminal Court, last month.
The remains of the 36-year-old childcare worker were found in the Dublin mountains in September 2013.
Dwyer was sentenced on Monday.
A judge told the court Dwyer had preyed on Ms O'Hara to satisfy his "perverse and debauched desires".
"We may be thankful a dangerous man is now out of the way," he said.
During the trial, the married father admitted having an affair with his vulnerable victim, whom he met through a website.
She was last seen on 22 August 2012, the day of her murder and had been missing for more than a year before her remains were discovered.
The jury found that Dwyer stabbed Ms O'Hara to death on Kilakee Mountain in Rathfarnham on 22 August, 2012, the day she left a psychiatric hospital.
He sent her a series of texts in the days leading up to the killing.
Dwyer told her she would be punished for trying to kill herself without him.
Her skeletal remains were found on Kilakee Mountain in Rathfarnham on 13 September 2013, the day of Dwyer's birthday.
Three days after that, her keys and other items were found in Vartry Reservoir in Roundwood, which had dried up due to a heatwave.
Dwyer was arrested on 17 October 2013 and he has been in custody ever since.
