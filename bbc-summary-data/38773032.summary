The 17-year-old, whose bedroom was plastered with Third Reich paraphernalia, was arrested after sharing images of the "viable" explosive on Snapchat.
Jurors heard the boy described Mrs Cox's killer Thomas Mair as "a HERO" in an online post.
He was cleared of a charge of preparing acts of terrorism.
The boy, who cannot be named because of his age, will be sentenced on 13 February.

Trial judge Mr Justice Goss told the court he was concerned about "a very disturbing mindset in this young man and unusual and worrying behaviour".
Counter-terrorism officers arrested the boy at his home in July after a member of the public reported him to police.
Officers found the improvised explosive device (IED) inside a desk drawer and an army bomb disposal expert was called out to make it safe.
Jurors also heard his bedroom was covered Nazi regalia, including a swastika flag and the symbol of the Waffen SS.
During his trial, the boy said he had built the bomb using plastic casing and sparklers months before posting the images.
Prosecutor Barnaby Jameson said the device was not high-powered but had "the capacity to cause shock and injury and damage to property in the immediate vicinity" if it had exploded.
Prosecutors also claimed the boy had been intending to carry out a terrorist attack, pointing to a series of online messages, including one which appeared to threaten Muslims.
However, the boy told the court he wanted people to think he was "planning an attack" but had no intention of doing so.
Asked what the point was of making something he did not use, he replied: "Not sure. I don't really know. It was kind of a pointless thing to do."
During his trial it emerged the boy was a member of the "secretive neo-Nazi" group National Action.
The court heard he would dress in Nazi uniform in order to "offend people" during online video conversations.
