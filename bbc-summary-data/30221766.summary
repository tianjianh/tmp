Hughes was carried off on a stretcher at the Sydney Cricket Ground after he was struck on the top of the neck by a short-pitched delivery from Sean Abbott, 22, during a Sheffield Shield game against New South Wales on Tuesday.
Cricket Australia CEO James Sutherland has paid this tribute to Hughes, describing him as a "hero to kids around the nation".
Australia cricket team coach Darren Lehmann, via Twitter: "RIP you little champ, we are all going to miss you. Love, prayers to all the Hughes family xxxx."
Cricket Australia on Twitter: "The strength of the cricket family is more important than ever on this incredibly sad day. Please keep Sean Abbott in your thoughts."
Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott: "Phillip Hughes was a young man living out his dreams. For a young life to be cut short playing our national game seems a shocking aberration. He was loved, admired and respected by his team-mates and by legions of cricket fans."

England batsman Nick Compton, who played with Hughes in Sydney and shared a house with him in London in 2009: "He was a very, very close friend of mine. He was a cheeky, funny, positive guy. Looking back, I feel like he's made the most of his 25 years and it breaks my heart to think of a guy who I certainly thought would go down in the record books as one of the better run-scorers in Australian cricket."
The England team released a statement on Twitter, saying: "Our deepest sympathies go out to Phil Hughes' family, friends and teammates at this incredibly sad time. Phil was admired and respected by all he played with and against and will never be forgotten by the cricket community."

"He was only 25 and to have achieved what he did in such a short period of time was extraordinary. He was modifying his game all the time as well.
"It is a tragedy that he is gone in terms of cricket, but that pales into insignificance when compared to what his friends and family are going through."

Former England bowler Dominic Cork, who played alongside Hughes at Hampshire: "I will remember him as a very fine young cricketer trying to make his way back into the Australia side.
"Sharing the same dressing room as him, he was a man you would always remember. He always had a cheeky smile on his face, always wanted to be the best and wore that baggy green with such pride.
"We have lost one of the bright hopes who would have been a big success in the game."
Worcestershire director of cricket Steve Rhodes, who coached Hughes during his season with the county side: "He was very humble, good fun and nobody had a bad word to say about him. He spent a lot of time working with the younger players, passing on his knowledge which was great for us."
Hampshire chairman Rod Bransgrove, reflecting on Hughes' spell with his county in 2010: "I cannot begin to comprehend the loss of a talented, ebullient and lovely lad.
"In the Australia dressing room after the international T20 at the Ageas Bowl in 2013, Hughesy said to me that after Shane Warne, Simon Katich, Shane Watson and Michael Clarke he felt like Hampshire's forgotten Aussie.
"I told him then, and I say it again now, you will never be forgotten Hughesy - you are part of our family. Rest in peace buddy."

South Australia team-mate Kane Richardson: "It was an honour to play alongside you at club, state and international level. You were an absolute genius on the field and a loveable lad off it.
