Marvel Comics has unveiled big changes for its hammer-wielding Norse superhero Thor - the character will become a woman.

The publisher said it hoped recasting Thor would attract more women and girls to superhero comic books.
New artwork reveals the once strapping and bearded Thunder God now as a buxom blonde, clad in a caped costume.
Thor first appeared in a Marvel adventure in 1962 and has been the star of two blockbuster movies.
New York-based Marvel described the move as "one of the most shocking and exciting changes ever to shake one of the 'big three' of Captain America, Iron Man and Thor.
"No longer is the classic Thunder God able to hold the mighty hammer, Mjolnir, and a brand new female hero will emerge worthy of the name Thor," it said in a news article.
Jason Aaron, writer of the new Thor series, said in a statement: "This is not She-Thor. This is not Lady Thor. This is not Thorita. This is Thor."
The female Thor is due to appear in her first adventure in October and be illustrated by Russell Dauterman.
