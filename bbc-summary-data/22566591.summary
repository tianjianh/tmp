Reports suggest the 50-year-old is on the verge of leaving Real Madrid to replace interim boss Rafael Benitez.
Lampard told BBC's Football Focus: "There's no way he'll come back and rest on any laurels or rest on anything that happened before.
"With him at the helm we are going to give it a great go."
Mourinho first took charge at Stamford Bridge in June 2004 having just guided Porto to Champions League glory.
He won six trophies in three years, including two Premier League titles, but left in September 2007 after his relationship with owner Roman Ambramovich had become increasingly strained.
The following June, Mourinho joined Inter Milan, where he won a second Champions League crown and two league titles in as many seasons.
He was tempted to Real Madrid in the summer of 2010 and won the Copa del Rey in his first season before deposing Barcelona as La Liga champions in his second.
Asked if Mourinho could repeat the successes of his first spell, the England midfielder, who signed a new one-year deal with the Blues on Thursday, said: "I certainly think he can because he is a workaholic. He's got desire.
"It is not confirmed yet [but] the idea of working with him is brilliant. His talent and ability as a manager for me is the best - certainly the best I've worked with
"I think he will take the club on again. He has shown it with Porto, with us, Inter Milan and Real Madrid."
Mourinho's likely return is thought to have had a bearing on Lampard extending his time at Stamford Bridge, as there had previously been much speculation that he was not going to be offered a new deal.
But Lampard said: "The club have been brilliant and I have seen, I don't know, double figures of managers coming in and you remain loyal to the club.
"So that wasn't in any way the main contributing factor. It is a fantastic place to be at."
Lampard became Chelsea's all-time leading scorer last week, overtaking Bobby Tambling's 202-goal record.
Meanwhile, Benitez admits he will be "sad" to leave his players after guiding them to Champions League qualification and Europa League success.
The Spaniard, who takes charge of his final Premier League game for the Blues against Everton on Sunday, said: "It is always sad when you have a group of players growing, winning and improving and then you have to go."
