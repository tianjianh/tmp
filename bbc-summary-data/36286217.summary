New Sheffield United manager Chris Wilder says taking the job was "a complete no-brainer".

Wilder left Northampton on Thursday to sign a three-year deal at Bramall Lane to replace Nigel Adkins.
The former Oxford boss, who guided the Cobblers to the League Two title, began his playing career with the Blades.
"Of course this is my dream job. Hopefully it will be a great period of my footballing career," he told BBC Radio Sheffield.
"I'm determined to get the club going forward and I understand the responsibility and the history.
"I'm ready for the challenge. As soon as this club made the telephone call it was a complete no-brainer. I wouldn't have been able to sleep at night if I had turned this down."
The 48-year-old held discussions with relegated Championship side Charlton earlier this week and was also linked with Blackburn Rovers.
Wilder is the club's fifth full-time manager since they were relegated to League One in 2011.
Adkins was sacked after failing to guide the team to a play-off finish and Wilder says the goal for next season is to win promotion.
"I'm not frightened of the challenge. I don't go in for three or five-year plans. If we can get out of the division this year then we will do," he added.
"The biggest thing is to go and win games of football and I put myself under enormous pressure to do that."

"Sheffield United will find no more enthusiastic a manager than Chris Wilder, as he's a die-hard Blade.
"Wilder is also a manager whose stock is high after a hugely successful time at Northampton.
"He faces a huge challenge to overhaul an under-performing squad and turn them into title contenders but he is a boss who calls a spade a spade and his honest forthright manner will be welcomed by the fan base."
