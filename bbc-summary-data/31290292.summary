The Hammers took the lead after Cheikhou Kouyate juggled the ball twice, swivelled, and volleyed in to the goal.
United looked to be running out of time when Daley Blind equalisted in the 93rd-minute after Angel Di Maria's cross.
The visitors finished with 10 men, defender Luke Shaw sent off for a second yellow card.
Allardyce said after the game that his side "couldn't cope with the long balls" that Manchester United played.
