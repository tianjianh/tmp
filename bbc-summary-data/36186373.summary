The young woman is believed to have taken a form of the drug known as Mastercard.
She died in hospital after police were called to the Victoria Warehouse in Trafford, shortly after 05:00 BST.
Greater Manchester Police urged anyone who may have taken the pills to seek medical attention.
Det Insp Helen Bell said: "This is a tragic situation, the death of a young person is always devastating, but in these circumstances, it is all the more heartbreaking."
"Sadly we know it is very unlikely that the girl was the only person to have taken this drug last night."
In a statement, Victoria Warehouse's owners confirmed the incident took place at the venue and said they were working with investigators.
"[We] would like to convey our deepest sympathies to the family of the deceased," it added.
