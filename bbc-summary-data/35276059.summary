[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Dog walkers and joggers in Cumbria have been asked to help track down water leaks.

United Utilities said that such people were likely to travel along a route regularly so were ideally placed to spot a suspicious puddle.
The water company has asked people to tweet or call so engineers can respond as quickly as possible.
Across the North West it deals with about 450 leaks a week, rising to about 750 during cold snaps.
