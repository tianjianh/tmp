The American, 21, who won middleweight gold at London 2012 and Rio 2016, turned professional in October.
Shields stopped Hungary's Szilvia Szabados with a strong punch in the fourth round in Detroit to take the North American Boxing Federation title.
She previously won her first professional fight in November.
The fight - which topped the bill - aired on Showtime, a premium channel which requires traditional cable subscribers to pay an additional fee.
"I wasn't just out there brawling with her - I showed my skill, I showed my power," Shields said.
"I showed how I box like Sugar Ray Robinson and Joe Louis mixed together.''
