Walsham Le Willows Football Club in Suffolk handed out half a dozen eggs to the first 50 paying supporters at the match v Brantham Athletic earlier.
The gesture was inspired by Non-League Day, a campaign to encourage supporters of bigger clubs to try local football.
Chairman Keith Mills said: "If we could attract an extra 20 people through the gate it would make a big difference."
Last year, Bungay Town gave out punnets of mushrooms in a similar ploy to tempt fans during the international break.
"We're all fighting for the same money," Mr Mills said. "We're a club that's out in the sticks and does well to attract supporters and sponsors, but it all boils down to money unfortunately."
The average gate at Summer Road, where admission is Â£6 for adults and Â£4 for concessions, is about 80 people.
Seventy-eight people attended Saturday's game, which was up on the last home game, watched by 42 people.
"One of our supporters, Mike Powles, is an egg producer so we asked him if we could give away some eggs," Mr Mills said. "It's a little gimmick but it got people talking."
Mr Mills hopes the free eggs, which were handed out after the match, will play a small part in spreading the popularity of non-league football, but said more support is also needed from high up.
"There's an enormous amount of money in the professional game and a lot of it is going out of the country, on foreign players," he said.
"The England team won't be successful until they support English players at grassroots levels."
James Doe, the founder of Non-League Day, which is now in its sixth year, said there is room for people to support more than one club.
"I hope Non-League Day can be an event which drives new people into grounds who wouldn't otherwise be there, providing them with an enjoyable experience and the clubs with some welcome extra funds," he said.
"Many non-league clubs are almost exclusively volunteer run, with money taken at the turnstiles often funding thriving youth set-ups, projects and facilities which are of benefit to the whole community."
