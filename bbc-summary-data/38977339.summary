[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Fulham claimed a third Championship win in a row with a comfortable victory at Ashton Gate that left Bristol City just two points above the relegation zone.

Lucas Piazon's calm finish gave the visitors a deserved 1-0 half-time lead.
Fulham's Floyd Ayite capitalised on sloppy defending to feed Tom Cairney, who fired in the second.
The win lifted Slavisa Jokanovic's side to within six points of the top six, with a game in hand, while City have lost 10 of their past 13 league games.
Milan Djuric had arguably the hosts' best chance before the break, but he headed David Cotterill's dangerous cross narrowly over the crossbar.
The visitors had time on the ball early on and some neat passing fed Piazon, who delicately lifted the ball past the on-rushing Fabian Giefer for the opener.
A poor clearance from Adam Matthews then led to Fulham's second, as Cairney lashed Ayite's pass into the top corner.
Fulham, who have now won five of their past seven games in all competitions, could have added to their tally, but Kevin McDonald glanced a corner just over the bar.
Boos greeted the half-time and full-time whistles at Ashton Gate, as well as the second goal, with the Robins fans venting their frustration as they watched their side lose for a 13th time in 17 league games.
Bristol City head coach Lee Johnson told BBC Radio Bristol: "I'm obviously angry, hurting and disappointed.
"We didn't have the team energy today. I've got to find a team and a formation that gives us the talent and the energy to go and get close to people.
"I don't think some players did enough, in terms of energy. But we have to go back to the drawing board.
"I understand the fans' frustrations completely. 100%, I'm with them."
Fulham manager Slavisa Jokanovic: "We played a very good game. We won three points, we took a clean sheet and we cut the distance between us and the top teams in the Championship.
"I have to be satisfied with how my team is fighting and how they concentrated after our FA Cup exit a few days ago.
"Lucas Piazon is fighting for every ball. He has been working very hard all season and today he scored a very nice goal."
