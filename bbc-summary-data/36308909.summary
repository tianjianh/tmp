The 64-year-old Italian was honoured after leading the Foxes to their maiden top-flight title in his first season with the club.
Ranieri also received the Premier League accolade, with Brighton's Chris Hughton taking the Championship award.
Wigan's Gary Caldwell and Northampton's Chris Wilder took the League One and League Two honours respectively.
Ranieri is only the second non-British or Irish manager to win the prestigious accolade after Arsenal's Arsene Wenger, who won it in both 2002 and 2004.
The Leicester boss had already picked up three manager of the month awards in the course of his side's remarkable campaign, and was named Italian manager of the year in his homeland last month.
Hughton received his award despite his side failing to win their division.
Brighton finished third in the second tier and were knocked out of the play-offs in the semi-finals on Monday by Sheffield Wednesday.
