Damian Welch's late try for Exeter Chiefs denied Gloucester victory in the Premiership at Sandy Park.

Gareth Steenson could have won the game for the hosts with a difficult, touchline conversion, but it went wide.
Matthew Scott, Charlie Sharples and Ben Morgan's tries had given Gloucester hope of a second win of the season.
But Chiefs - who crossed through Thomas Waldrom and Ian Whitten in the first half - battled back with Whitten's second try and Welch's last-gasp score.
Gloucester came into the fixture having surrendered leads to Newcastle and West Country rivals Bath in their previous two games.
Last season's beaten finalists Exeter, who have also suffered a mixed start this term and fell to a 20-19 loss to Northampton Saints in their previous outing, looked on course for their fourth defeat of the season but rallied in the final five minutes.
Steenson's superb kick to touch from a penalty set his side up to drive from the line-out and, in typical fashion, they crashed over the line in the corner to secure a draw.
Gloucester are now 10th in the table with only one win from their first six games.
