April Oliver, from Norfolk, uploaded an image of her cradling a baby on her Facebook page on Father's Day.
She told the BBC she would not be releasing any more details. Miss Oliver announced her pregnancy in January, four months after Mr Mckeague vanished.
The RAF gunner, 23, went missing on a night out in Bury St Edmunds, with a search of a landfill site ongoing.
Miss Oliver said she discovered she was pregnant with Mr Mckeague's baby two weeks after his disappearance and said in January: "I've had to make a massive decision by myself.
"I was hoping and praying that he'd come back so we could make the decision together."
The pair met on a dating site and had been in a relationship for five months before Mr Mckeague - originally from  Dunfermline in Fife - went missing from his base at RAF Honington in Suffolk.
The personal trainer told the BBC when she announced her pregnancy that her partner is "just the sweetest and most outgoing person I've ever known".
In May, Miss Oliver posted a black and white image of her holding her bump and a pair of boots, like the ones Mr Mckeague was wearing when he went missing, alongside a message on Facebook.
"Your daddy would be proud of you my little one and would love you as much as I do," she wrote.
Mr Mckeague had been out with friends in September when he went missing and was last seen entering a bin loading bay known as the "horseshoe" at about 03:25 BST.
A waste disposal lorry collected a bin from that area less than an hour after Mr Mckeague was spotted on CCTV.
Specialist officers began sifting through waste in March at the landfill site in Milton, Cambridgeshire, where they believe his body may be.
The search so far has cost more than Â£1m.
Police initially estimated the search of the vast landfill site could take 10 weeks.
