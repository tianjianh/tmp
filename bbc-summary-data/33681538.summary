The Argentina international leaves United just a year after they paid Real Madrid a British record £59.7m for him.
Di Maria, 27, has signed a four-year deal with the French champions after undergoing a medical in Qatar on Tuesday.
"I am very proud and I can't wait to wear the colours of Paris St-Germain," he said.
Di Maria failed to join United on their pre-season tour of America last month, and manager Louis van Gaal had said he "did not know why".

The former Benfica winger made a strong start to his Old Trafford career, with a goal and an assist in three of his first four games.
But after being played in six different positions, including central midfield and striker, a pelvic injury kept him out for the whole of December 2014.
Reports that he was unsettled in Manchester followed an attempted break-in at Di Maria's home in Cheshire, in January.
He was then sent off in the FA Cup quarter-final defeat by Arsenal on 9 March and did not start another game until the final match of the campaign at Hull, only to limp off with a hamstring injury after 23 minutes.
A Champions League winner with Real, Di Maria will be competing with Zlatan Ibrahimovic, Edinson Cavani and Ezequiel Lavezzi for a starting place at PSG.
"I want to win the Champions League, which is a dream for all footballers, for a second time," he said.
"We will do everything we can to bring Europe's biggest trophy to France and the fans of Paris St-Germain."
United have themselves spent £83m this summer, including the £31m signing of Memphis Depay from PSV Eindhoven.
