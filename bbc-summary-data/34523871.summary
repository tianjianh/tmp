A contract for the 24/7 helpline, funded by the Department of Health, is due to expire at the end of the year.
The way forward is being consulted on by the Public Health Agency until 19 November.
Fergus Cumiskey, managing director of the charity Contact, which operates Lifeline, said people at risk would be disadvantaged.
"The service that is being proposed is a signposting service, that means a unique reference number will be issued," he said.
"The person in crisis will have to make their way independently to a provider in the community as opposed to the seamless referral process that we currently have that hand-holds and walks the person or the family through the process."
Last year, the charity said there had been a large increase in people contacting its helpline and said calls to its crisis response service had risen by almost a third.
The Lifeline service is Northern Ireland's main helpline for people at risk of suicide.
The Public Health Agency said in a statement that the proposals aimed to "keep the best elements of the current service and expand the overall level of services available".
It said it proposed to maintain the 24/7 telephone service.
"Follow-on counselling services will continue to be offered if needed, and to further improve the service, the agency is proposing to increase the number of counselling sessions available by 27%," a spokesperson said.
"In addition, the proposals include a new service of face to face support for those in immediate need, and complementary therapy sessions to assist recovery and engagement in services."
