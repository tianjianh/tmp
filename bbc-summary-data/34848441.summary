Acclaimed bass player Kyle Eastwood and his band will play at the Gardyne Theatre on the opening night of the five-day event.
Organisers said the audience should expect "slick modern jazz, blending swing, bop, and soulful funk".
The festival runs from 18-22 November with gigs at a variety of venues in the city.
Other performers during the week include the Red Stripe Band, Ian Siegal and the East Coast of Scotland young jazz musicians.
Mr Eastwood is a double and electric bass player who has had a 17-year career in the music industry.
The festival said he had released seven critically acclaimed albums and was also a composer and arranger.
He has worked on several of his father's films, including Million Dollar Baby, Gran Torino and Letters From Iwo Jima.
