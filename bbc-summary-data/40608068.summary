The 20-year-old had a brief loan spell with Wood in 2014-15 and left Stevenage this summer after 12 appearances, none of which came last term.
"As soon as I knew that Boreham Wood were interested, I was really happy," Johnson told the club website.
"I know that they are a good club with good ambitions and I am looking forward to playing a lot of games."
