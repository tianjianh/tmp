The action will take place on 22 June, while a ban on overtime and work-to-rule will be carried out next week.
The dispute is over proposed changes to pensions which could see employees retiring at 65 instead of 60.
The union Community said workers had been left with "no option" but to strike. Tata Steel said it was "very disappointed".
Tata has four sites in Wales in Port Talbot, Newport, Flintshire and Carmarthenshire, as well as sites in England including Corby, Hartlepool, Rotherham, Scunthorpe, Teesside and York.
Reacting to news of the strike, a Tata Steel spokesman said: "We have been trying to develop an affordable and sustainable pension scheme for employees so we are very disappointed by today's announcement on strike and industrial action.
"Everyone agrees that changes need to be made to resolve the challenges facing our pension scheme, which has a projected shortfall of over Â£2 billion.
"We will soon be announcing new measures which will lessen the impact of the proposed pension changes, particularly on our longest-serving employees nearing retirement age."
Roy Rickhuss, general secretary of the Community trade union, said Tata had given workers "no option" but to take industrial action.
He said: "The company has not shown any willingness to return to meaningful negotiations to find an end to this dispute.
"The company could avoid this by returning to the table."
