[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A Britain's Got Talent finalist plied a teenage boy with "strong alcohol and beer", a court has heard.

Kombat Breakers dancer Leeroy Bailey, 35, denies cruelty to a child by exposing him to alcohol in 2016.
He had invited the boy over to watch a film or play video games, Warwick Crown Court was told.
There was "significant potential" for the boy - who required an ambulance - to have ended up with alcohol poisoning, the prosecution said.

Mr Bailey, whose talent show troupe lost in the final of the ITV show in 2007, called an ambulance when the boy became ill.
Jonathan Eley, for the prosecution, told the court the dancer, from Foleshill in Coventry, had "supplied" alcohol to the youngster, who cannot be named for legal reasons.
"The victim was not used to drinking and had a reaction to this," Mr Eley said.
"He vomited and vomited - and vomited that much that Mr Bailey was so concerned, that when the victim asked for an ambulance to be called he did."
Paramedics found the teenager in his boxer shorts being sick in the toilet, adding the alleged victim told police he had taken off his own tracksuit because he "didn't want to sick on it", the prosecutor said.
The boy had to stay overnight in hospital to recover.
Mr Eley said that Mr Bailey had initially "implied" to police during interview, that the boy had turned up drunk, but later accepted he had offered him alcohol "in the sense 'it's there, help yourself' but claimed he did not physically hand it over."
The trial continues.
