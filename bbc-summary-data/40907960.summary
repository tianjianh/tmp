[SN]TITLE[SN]
Milton Keynes Dons 1-0 Gillingham

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Osman Sow scored on his MK Dons debut to hand his new side their first points of the League One season with a 1-0 win over Gillingham.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Sow's strike was also the Dons' first goal of the campaign and proved the difference after both sides missed late penalties.
Kieran Agard saw his effort saved while Josh Wright blazed over the bar in a dramatic final few minutes at Stadium MK.
Following a drab first half, it was a hopeful ball into the Gillingham box from Aaron Tshibola little more than a minute after the resumption that found Sow lurking at the back post, and the Swede nodded home.
The Dons should have doubled their lead 10 minutes from time after Ryan Seager was brought down by Gillingham goalkeeper Tomas Holy inside the box.
However, Agard's resulting spot-kick was well saved by the 25-year-old custodian.
Gillingham's Wright was then given his opportunity to level the tie with his own penalty three minutes from time after Dons goalkeeper Lee Nicholls was judged to have fouled Liam Nash in the box.
But the Gills captain blasted his spot-kick over the crossbar as the Dons recorded their first win of the season.
