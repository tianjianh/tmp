Australian Open 2016: Andy Murray says wife and baby are priority

As he prepares for a year in which he will try to win the Australian Open for the first time and successfully defend his Olympic title, Andy Murray says his priority for 2016 is his family.

Murray's wife Kim is due to give birth to their first child next month, and the British number one remains determined to be there, even if it means leaving Melbourne early.
"My child is more important to me, and my wife is more important to me, than a tennis match," he said, in the run-up to the first Grand Slam of the year.
"It's a big change for me and my wife, but that's the current priority and I'll see after that.
"I have no idea how that will change things. I still love tennis: I have trained and prepared as best as possible for here and I feel like I'm in a good position to do well, but my current priority is my family."

The Scot, 28, will face German teenager Alexander Zverev on Tuesday in the first round of the Australian Open.
He does not have a private jet on standby, so it will take a minimum of 24 hours to cover the 10,500-mile journey home should his wife go into labour.
But the world number two said confidently: "As soon as the call comes in, I'll find a way to get home in time, I'm sure."
Novak Djokovic, 28, won three Grand Slam titles in the year after becoming a father, and 34-year-old Roger Federer shows no signs of slowing up as he travels the world with two sets of twins.
"When I'm practising and when I'm playing matches, I'm fine. I can concentrate very well on my tennis," Murray said.
"The thing with the time change is that during my day Kim is sleeping, and when I'm sleeping she's obviously awake, so there's only a couple of hours at the end of the day when we're awake at the same time.
"I think everyone who's been in the position of becoming a parent, in the few weeks beforehand you think about it quite a lot - it's a pretty big thing that's about to happen."
Murray, who has lost four finals at Melbourne Park, is the second seed this year.
