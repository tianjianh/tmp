[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Joshua Smith, 27, was last seen on 25 October crossing railway lines near his Staffordshire home.
Police said at the time it was possible he had taken a harmful substance and due to "the potential risk of substance transfer" asked that "no direct physical contact was made" with him.
A member of the public found the body by the Trent and Mersey canal in Stone.
Friends and family have been searching for Mr Smith since he disappeared.
His family revealed on social media on Saturday afternoon that a body had been recovered.
They thanked people for their "help and support over the past few weeks".
In a statement, Staffordshire Police said: "The family of Joshua have been informed of the situation and are being offered the services of specialist officers during this difficult time."
The force is now working with the coroner.
