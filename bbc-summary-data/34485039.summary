Amidst the celebrations at Windsor Park in Belfast following Northern Ireland's victory over Greece on Thursday night, one man in the stadium could have been forgiven if he wanted a quiet moment of contemplation.

Nigel Worthington was Michael O'Neill's predecessor as Northern Ireland manager and knows the pain of missing out on qualification for a European Championship finals.
But as a player, he was present when the national side last qualified for a major tournament in Mexico in 1986.
He is well placed to offer an assessment on the scale of the current team's achievement and the pressures involved.
"I think it is a fantastic achievement by the players and manager and for the supporters who have been there through thick and thin," he said.
"The finals in France are something for them to look forward to and enjoy. They should take huge pride in what they have achieved.
"There was a period when Michael was manager when he went a number of games without a win, but he stuck with it and never gave up. The Irish Football Association also stuck with him and they should take credit for that.
"It is never easy to qualify, Northern Ireland got off to a great start with wins over Hungary, the Faroe Islands and Greece, they started the ball rolling and then it just gained momentum.
"I was at the game last night and it was fantastic, the team played really well and the atmosphere was incredible."
Worthington was part of the Northern Ireland team that drew with England 0-0 at Wembley in November 1985 to secure qualification for the World Cup finals in Mexico.
He said there was little time for celebration after the game, but recalled with fondness the post-match television interview of central defender, the late Alan McDonald.
"The celebration was short-lived, it was a Wednesday night, you went over to the fans, but then you were back in training with your club on the Thursday," he added.
"I remember Big Mac saying in the interview 'if anyone thinks that was a fix they can come and see me'.
"That was typical of Big Mac, he played with passion and pride and never let his head drop.
"He spoke from the heart."
The former Sheffield Wednesday and Leeds United full-back said it took time to digest that success and he thinks it will be the same for O'Neill's players.
"At Wembley in 1985 it took a while to sink in and the current Northern Ireland players will experience this, it drip feeds into your system over the weeks until the end of the season and the start of the finals," he said.
"Then you look back on what you have achieved.
"I remember the pre-tournament training in Guadalajara in Mexico when we reached the finals, it was tough trying to acclimatise.
"The whole spectacle around the World Cup, the different teams being there and the supporters, was really fantastic."
Worthington also had a simple message for the players who now have the opportunity to sample Northern Ireland's first ever appearance at a European Championship finals.
"You are already the pride of Northern Ireland after this huge achievement, go and play with a smile on your face," he added.
