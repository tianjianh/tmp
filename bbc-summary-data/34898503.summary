[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A record number of passengers have used Manchester Airport in the last year.

A total of 23 million passed through the terminals during the last 12 months - a 5% increase on the previous year and about 30% higher than in 2010.
Managing director Ken O'Toole predicted that the next 12 months would be even busier because new routes to China, Boston and Los Angeles have been added.
Manchester Airport opened 77 years ago and now provides flights to 210 destinations around the world.
Mr O'Toole said: "We have more than 22 million people living within two hours of the airport and our continued addition of new routes and increased frequencies is seeing both business and leisure customers choose Manchester.
"Manchester Airport has never been busier and our continued growth is testament to the role we play in connecting people across the North to destinations in all four corners of the world."
