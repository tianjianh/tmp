Ayerza, 32, helped his country reach the semi-finals, but was then injured in training and missed the bronze medal match against South Africa.
Director of rugby Richard Cockerill told BBC Radio Leicester: "We are hoping it's seven, 10 or 14 days."
Ayerza will miss the Premiership match against Exeter on Saturday, 7 November.
He could return for the start of the European campaign when Tigers play Stade Francais at Welford Road the following Friday.
