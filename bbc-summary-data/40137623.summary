The 55-year-old replaces Paul Cook, who left to become Wigan manager earlier this week after leading Pompey to the League Two title last season.
Jackett quit as manager of the Millers in November after just 39 days and five games in charge.
He has twice led sides to promotion from League One, firstly Millwall in 2010 and then Wolves in 2014.
Former Wales defender Jackett also steered Swansea to the League One play-off final in 2006, but they were beaten on penalties by Barnsley.
"We're delighted to announce Kenny as our new manager - he ticks so many boxes for us," chief executive Mark Catlin told the club website.
"He's managed big clubs with big expectations in the past and has plenty of experience of getting sides out of League One."
A Portsmouth statement said the club are in "advanced talks" with Joe Gallen - who worked with Jackett at Rotherham, QPR, Millwall and Wolves - to become assistant manager at Fratton Park.
Since leaving Rotherham, Jackett has spent time working in Tottenham's youth set-up, while awaiting a new managerial opportunity.
"This is a fantastic opportunity for me and I'm looking forward to getting started. It's an exciting challenge," he said of his new job.
"This club has a passionate fan-base and they can be a 12th man for us. Hopefully we can build on the momentum of last season and continue to progress."
