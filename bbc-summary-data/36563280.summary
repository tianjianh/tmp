The militants stormed into Kuda village in Adamawa state on motorbikes and opened fire on women and children at the wake, a witness said.
At least 10 people were wounded in the raid, witnesses said.
The village is near Sambisa forest, where the militants fled to last year after losing control of urban areas.
In December, Nigeria's President Muhammadu Buhari said Boko Haram had been "technically defeated", but the group has continued to carry out hit-and-run raids in the north-east and in neighbouring states.
Some 17,000 people have died in the insurgency launched by the militants in 2009 to create an Islamic state, Amnesty International says.
