There's more to Australia than mining

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Australians must be feeling pretty smug these days. Despite a collapse in global commodity prices, it has managed to escape recession yet again.

So what are Australians getting right?
It may just come down to that "lucky country" clich√© we hear about all the time.
There's no denying that as mines have closed, jobs have been lost and that's putting pressure on the government to find new avenues of growth - but don't forget Australia is already a highly diversified economy.
Services like tourism, finance, business, technology and education are major components of Australia's economy and they've benefited from a weaker Australian dollar.
The agriculture sector is also seeing renewed interest - check out the report I did on Australia's agricultural sector here.
Mining has also seen a boost from the lower Australian dollar, because it has meant that Australia's products are cheaper at a time when demand has dropped.
Investments in mining software have helped the industry to remain competitive even in a downturn, and maintain Australia's global share of resource exports.
