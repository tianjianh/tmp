Swansea defender Williams, 31, collided heavily with team-mate Jonny Williams late on in the Euro 2016 last-16 1-0 win over Northern Ireland.
Substitute James Collins was ready to enter the game, but the Wales captain insisted he stayed on the field.
"We think it was when he fell and landed on his hand with a straight arm which had an impact on his shoulder," Coleman said. "But he is okay."
Coleman dismissed speculation the shoulder was dislocated.
"Ashley will be fine. It sounds better actually, that he would play with a dislocated shoulder - and he would if we let him. But it was not.

''It's probably a bit more sore today than yesterday because of the timing, 48 hours after the game. We will get him on the grass as soon as we can.
''I would not say he was a worry or a doubt, but we know we have to look after him. I would be surprised if he does not make the game.''
Williams had received hospital treatment on Saturday evening following the game in Paris
Having apparently recovered from the collision, Williams briefly sat down on the pitch as play continued, leading Coleman to ready a substitute.
Northern Ireland manager Michael O'Neill felt Wales deliberately made the most of Williams' situation.
"I was disappointed with the time-wasting. The [Welsh] bench told Ashley Williams to sit down," he told BBC Sport.
Wales secured a quarter-final against Hungary or Belgium in Lille on Friday, 1 July thanks to Gareth McAuley's 75th-minute own goal.
