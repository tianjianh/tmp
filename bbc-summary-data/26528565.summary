Scottish independence: Council sending out 'No' vote letters

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Labour-led administration on Aberdeen City Council is to press ahead with sending out letters endorsing a "No" vote in September's independence referendum.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
About 200,000 letters will be included in bills sent out to council tax payers.
The SNP called for the letters to be pulped but the coalition backed the move to send them.
Labour council leader Barney Crockett insisted it was the right decision.
He said: "We are completely confident that what we are doing is not political campaigning."
SNP and Lib Dem councillors walked out the meeting after it was decided to hold the discussion on the letters in private.
SNP group leader Callum McCaig said: "It's beyond pathetic, this is an out of control administration."
Aberdeen City Council is run by a coalition of Labour, the Conservatives and independents.
