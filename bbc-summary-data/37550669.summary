The father of a Scottish boxer who suffered a bleed on the brain after a fight last year has called for a rethink on safety within boxing.

It follows the death of professional fighter Mike Towell following a bout in Glasgow last week.
Amateur boxer Daniel Flaherty had to have part of his skull removed after he collapsed in Motherwell last October.
His father, John Flaherty, told BBC Radio Scotland that his son will never go into a boxing ring again.
Daniel Flaherty, from Stirling, collapsed after losing a fight that could have seen him named Scottish Novice Champion.
He underwent life-saving surgery to stem the bleeding on his brain at the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital in Glasgow that night.
A few days later, after taking a turn for the worse, he had part of his skull removed. He has since had a titanium plate fitted.
His father told the Good Morning Scotland programme that Daniel had made a "very good recovery".
He said: "At the time, there was questions whether there would be some sense of brain injury but that doesn't seem to have materialised.
"He's got back more or less full mobility. His speech is a bit slurred at times but he's ok with that.
"He had a wee problem with his eyes at first but that's settled down too. All in all, where we've been and where we are now, we couldn't ask for any more."
John Flaherty said neither he nor his son oppose boxing, despite their experience over the last 12 months.
But he added: "Daniel obviously, being through what he's been through, he wouldn't go in the ring again.
"And if he knew what was going to happen to him he wouldn't have gone into the ring."
Mr Flaherty pointed to the death of Mike Powell, the life-threatening injuries suffered by Nick Blackwell in a fight with Chris Eubank Jr in March, and the experience of his son, as evidence that there needs to be a rethink in the sport.
He called for head guards to be reintroduced to the amateur sport, after they were removed from men's boxing in 2013 amid claims it would reduce concussions.
He also suggested that the method of scoring could be changed, and they could "take away the head as a target", especially at amateur level.
"I don't believe for a minute, in all honesty, that a boxer goes into the ring thinking that he could die that day," Mr Flaherty said.
"I think boxers go into the ring and think it will never happen to me."
Mr Flaherty claimed that brain bleeds "happen quite regularly" in boxing.
"The problem is they're not reported very well, there's not record of it," he said.
"Boxing itself doesn't keep a record. Even Daniel's case wasn't investigated."
