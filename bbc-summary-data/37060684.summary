First minister to hold Brexit Q&A; with EU nationals

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Hundreds of EU nationals living in Scotland are to get the chance to question the first minister about the implications of the Brexit vote.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Nicola Sturgeon is to take part in a question and answer session with 450 people from 24 different EU countries.
The event will follow a meeting of Ms Sturgeon's cabinet in Edinburgh on Wednesday, 17 August.
The Scottish government is examining its options in the wake of the referendum result.
While the UK as a whole voted to leave the European Union, voters in Scotland backed staying in by 62% to 38%.
The first minister has travelled to Brussels and Berlin for talks since the vote in June, and has had meetings with consuls from member states in Edinburgh.
Ms Sturgeon said Scotland "spoke loudly and clearly" when it delivered an "unequivocal" vote to remain in the EU.
She said: "It is my duty as first minister to speak on behalf of all Scottish citizens, including those who have chosen to come from other parts of the EU and make Scotland their home.
"They have brought a wealth of social, economic and cultural benefits and have enriched our society. And as I said on the day after the referendum, they remain very welcome here.
"My cabinet and I are determined to provide reassurance and certainty, wherever we can, to those who have come to Scotland and have contributed so valuably."
Ms Sturgeon has also outlined an economic stimulus plan in a bid to boost the economy and tackle uncertainty in the wake of the Brexit vote, and set up a Standing Council on Europe to provide advice.
