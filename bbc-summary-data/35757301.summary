Beattock minibus crash driver 'drifted off'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A minibus driver has admitted he "drifted off" or had a blackout in a crash in which a baby in a car seat was thrown out onto the hard shoulder.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Ian Scrivener, 35, of Milton Keynes, admitted careless driving on the A74(M) near Beattock in June last year.
Dumfries Sheriff Court heard the baby had to be taken to hospital in Glasgow with a head injury after the crash.
Sheriff Brian Mohan said Scrivener had a record of driving offences and deferred sentence for a month.
The minibus driver also admitted driving with only a provisional licence and no insurance.
The baby girl was one of eight people, including five other children, who were injured in the crash. They were all travelling in the minibus.
Firefighters had to use cutting gear to rescue some of the passengers from the vehicle.
The baby was taken to the Royal Hospital for Sick Children in Glasgow where she was kept in overnight after suffering suspected head injuries.
The others were taken to Dumfries and Galloway Royal Infirmary with a variety of minor injuries.
Fiscal depute Jennifer McGill said that Scrivener had taken over at the wheel when the driver complained of being tired.
Solicitor Ranald Lindsay told the court he had been tested for blackouts but the results had proved negative.
Sentence was deferred for background reports.
