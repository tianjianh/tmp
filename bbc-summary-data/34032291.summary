Steven Sheerer faces charges of child endangerment and distribution of obscenity to a minor, authorities said on Saturday.
Sheerer, 25, was arrested on Friday night at his home in Barnegat, New Jersey, police said.
He faces up to 10 years in prison if convicted, authorities said.
His bail was set at $40,000 (Â£25,485) cash.
"Rosie's concern has been and always will be the health, safety and well-being of her daughter," O'Donnell's spokeswoman Cindi Berger told the AP news agency.
"Rosie is profoundly appreciative for the work the Ocean County Prosecutor's Office has done and the diligence of the local police," she added.
US comedian and talk show host O'Donnell tweeted last Tuesday that Chelsea "has been found and is safe in police custody - thank u all for the help and light".
The 17-year-old was reported missing to police in Nyack, New York state, on 11 August after failing to return home.
O'Donnell, 53, had asked for the public's help in finding her adopted daughter, who was with a therapy dog.
"Chelsea, like millions of people, lives with mental illness," said Ms Berger at the time.
