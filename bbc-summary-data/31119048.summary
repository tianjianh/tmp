The Jordanian FA president, 39, is one of three challengers to current Fifa president Sepp Blatter for the 29 May election.
Prince Ali says Fifa has discouraged dissent and debate under Blatter's 17-year tenure as president.
"In the past people have taken a principled stand and they have ended up being punished for it," he said.
"I hope things are played fairly and in the right way now."
Fifa has suffered a number of damaging corruption allegations during Blatter's period as president.
Ethics investigator Michael Garcia resigned in December in protest at Fifa's handling of his report into bidding for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups in Russia and Qatar.
Prince Ali, who is also vice-president of the Asian Football Confederation and head of the West Asian Football Federation, says Fifa needs to accept that the corruption allegations have damaged the organisation's standing.
"Everybody realises that we need to improve the reputation of Fifa. You need to work from the bottom up, and you need to have a president who serves the sport," he told BBC Sport.
"If I was president, I would take responsibility for the actions that have taken place, and I will do that hopefully in the future."
The member of the Jordanian royal family, who has been on the Fifa executive committee for four years, added that he will resign if Blatter is re-elected.
"I couldn't see myself being on the executive for the next four years, given the circumstances that are," he said.
