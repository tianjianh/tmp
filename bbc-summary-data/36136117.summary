Tickets have gone sale for the world's "longest and tallest tunnel slide" down the Orbit Tower, next to the Olympic Stadium.

The ride will measure 178m (584ft) in length and 76m (249ft) in height, with the descent taking about 40 seconds.
The £3.5m attraction in east London will be open from 24 June.
The Orbit tower previously ran at a loss of £520,000 in 2014-15, while being used as an observation tower.
The London Legacy Development Corporation (LLDC) says it will recover the money spent to build the slide in five years.
The tower had been forecast to make a profit of £1.2m by the LLDC.
Adult tickets will cost £17, with £12 to access the sculpture and £5 to slide down, although it is £15 if you book in advance.
Park officials said the ride would give a "different perspective" of the tower.
Turner Prize-winning artist Anish Kapoor and structural designer Cecil Balmond designed the tower for the 2012 Olympics.
The slide has 12 twists and ends with a 50m (164ft) straight run to the ground.
It was designed by German artist Carsten Höller, who last year designed slides which ran outside the Hayward Gallery on the Southbank.
