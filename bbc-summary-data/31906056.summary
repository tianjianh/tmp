The sails on a 208-year-old windmill will not be hung until next week after a crane broke down during restoration work.

Green's Mill, in Sneinton, Nottingham, had to stop operating last year when two of the sails were discovered to be rotten.
Specialist millwrights built two sails and restored the other two ready for hanging on Monday.
However, after the setback, staff said work would recommence on 23 March.
Green's Windmill tweeted: "Bad news folks... the cherry picker has broken down, so no new sails today. Work to recommence Monday. Sorry for the let down."
The sails stopped turning in April last year when a problem with two of the panels was discovered but the repairs company could not start work before October.
They were recently delivered on Monday and were due to be raised later.
Jamie Duff, heritage officer at the mill, said: "It is disappointing, we were all very excited... we thought today was the day.
"There's no point in being too disappointed."
The charity needed Â£40,000 to pay for the repairs which it raised through events in the community and grants.
