Margaret MacMillan: The echoes of 1914

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
2016 has been a momentous year. The UK's vote to leave the European Union and the election of Donald Trump confounded expectations, while the wars in Syria and Yemen caused more bloodshed. BBC Radio 4's Today programme asked top historians which year in history 2016 most resembled. Margaret MacMillan is reluctantly reminded of 1914.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
History does not neatly repeat itself but, oh, there are so often echoes and rhymes.
Some years - and it always depends a bit on who and where you are - slide by without fuss, unremarked.
Others - 1939, 1989, or going further back the 1789 of the French Revolution - do stick in our memories as earthquakes do.
So what is 2016 and what might it remind us of?
I wish I could stop, but I find myself thinking of 1914.
The world then had seemed so stable, so manageable.
Crises - political, social, economic, military - came and went but "they", bankers, statesmen, politicians, always managed them in the end.
Yes, there were grumblings - from the working classes or women, or those who were losing their livelihoods because of free trade or mechanisation.
And there were some strong emotions about: fears of rapid change, passionate nationalisms that meant love of one's own country and hatred of others.
Ominous in retrospect because we know what happened. But at the time there was a complacency - it would surely all work out all right.
That confidence was dangerous because it meant that people didn't take the warning signs seriously enough.
I wish I could stop making the comparisons.
Margaret MacMillan is the Warden of St Antony's College and a professor of international history at the University of Oxford.
