[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A ward at a children's hospital has been closed to new admissions after some patients tested positive for a highly infectious bug.

The decision was taken by bosses at the Royal Hospital for Children in Glasgow after cases of rotavirus were detected.
Rotavirus is the most common cause of diarrhoea among infants and young children.
Four patients at the hospital have tested positive for rotavirus, while three others were showing symptoms.
NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde said the ward in question had been closed to any new patients for the time being.
A health board spokeswoman said: "Enhanced infection control precautions have been put in place and visitors are being reminded of the importance of hand hygiene when entering and leaving the hospital."
Once someone has been exposed to rotavirus, it can take up to two days for the symptoms to appear.
Children who become infected may have severe diarrhoea, often with vomiting, fever, loss of appetite and abdominal pain which can last from three to eight days.
