[SN]TITLE[SN]
Barrow 2-3 Dover Athletic

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Ricky Miller celebrated his position as the National League's leading goalscorer with a hat-trick as Dover won 3-2 at Barrow.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Jordan Williams opened the scoring in fine fashion for the hosts, picking up the ball on the halfway line and weaving his way through Dover's defence before firing home after 20 minutes.
That lead lasted just two minutes before Miller equalised and the 28-year-old then made it 2-1 from the spot after 47 minutes.
Moussa Diarra levelled for Barrow with 23 minutes remaining but Miller took his league goals tally for the season to 40 late on to secure the win for Dover, who finish just outside the play-offs in sixth place after Aldershot's win over Braintree.
