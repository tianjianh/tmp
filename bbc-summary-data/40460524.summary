The 27-year-old was released by the Black Cats following their relegation from the Premier League but spent much of his three years out on loan.
Last season he had an injury-hit loan spell at Sheffield Wednesday.
"He's a player with a lot of Championship experience and we're looking forward to working with him," said Bolton boss Phil Parkinson.
