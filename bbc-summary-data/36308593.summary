The shadow mental health minister and MP for Liverpool Wavertree said she was "flattered" that people had asked her to stand for the "metro mayor" role.
Another Liverpool MP, Steve Rotheram, is also considering seeking Labour's nomination, the BBC's Arif Ansari said.
Elections for mayor of the Liverpool City Region will be held in 2017.
It will cover five Merseyside councils - Liverpool, St Helens, Knowsley, Sefton and Wirral - as well as Halton in Cheshire.
If they do choose to run, Ms Berger and Mr Rotheram would face competition for Labour's nomination from the current mayor of Liverpool, Joe Anderson, who has already confirmed he will put himself forward.
Ms Berger added: "I will be consulting with family, friends and members of my constituency Labour Party in the coming days, before reaching a decision on whether to put my hat in the ring."
Ministers have championed the idea of regional elected mayors in exchange for the devolution of powers from Whitehall.
Labour's former shadow home secretary Andy Burnham said last week he was considering putting himself forward for a similar role in Greater Manchester.
