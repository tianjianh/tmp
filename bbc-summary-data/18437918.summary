The Amazing Spider-Man opens on limited release in Japan in June and worldwide on 3 July and explains how geeky teen Peter Parker becomes the superhero.
Garfield, 28, takes over the comic book role, played on screen by Tobey Maguire in the previous three movies.
The 3D film co-stars Emma Stone and new screen villain, Rhys Ifans.
"Spider-Man has always been the only teenage superhero, and the most human one in my humble opinion, and that's just one of the things that sets him apart," Garfield, best known for his role in The Social Network, told Reuters news agency.
"He's all too human, that's what's wonderful about him."
The Spider-Man trilogy - directed by Sam Raimi, began in 2002, with follow-up films in 2004 and 2007.
The latest chapter in the franchise is directed by Marc Webb, who enjoyed box office success in 2009 with the romantic comedy (500) Days of Summer.
"New love interest, the story of Peter's life, there's a lot of stuff to learn about Peter Parker," said the 23-year-old Emma Stone.
The Help star, who is rumoured to be dating Garfield off-screen, plays Spider-Man's love interest - Gwen Stacy.
"He's a real underdog, and he's bullied, and I think everyone can relate ... He's an incredibly inspirational character."
The film also sees Martin Sheen join the cast as Parker's Uncle Ben - while Sally Field takes over the Aunt May role from Rosemary Harris.
"It was very, very clear to all of us that this is a movie that was meant to be told in 3D," producer Matt Tolmach told reporters in Japan.
"3D is a form of storytelling, not just a way to sell the movie to audiences."
Japan has proved a key overseas market for the Spider-Man films, with the Spider-Man 3 premiering in Tokyo in 2007.
