[SN]TITLE[SN]
Duns housing proposals rejected

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Councillors have rejected plans for a housing development on the edge of a Borders town.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Berwickshire Housing Association had applied to build 60 houses, including 15 affordable homes, on land south of Earlsmeadow at Duns.
A report to councillors said the proposed site was an overgrown field, sometimes used by dog walkers.
It said that while it might be suitable for development in future it could be classified as "rural farmland".
Planning officials said the application should be refused on the basis that it lay outside the town's existing boundary and because the need for such housing had not been adequately demonstrated or justified.
They added that, if the go-ahead were given at this stage, it would be detrimental to the proper planning of the future expansion of Duns.
