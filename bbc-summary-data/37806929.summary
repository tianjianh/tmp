Skipper Johnnie Jackson also fired home for the Addicks as they saw off a second-half fightback from the visitors courtesy of substitute Tom Hopper's header.
Following early Scunthorpe dominance, it was Charlton who took the lead through a sublime left-foot strike from Lookman as the first-half substitute converted his fourth goal of the season in style.
The hosts doubled their lead six minutes later courtesy of Jackson's fine low finish.
The visitors managed to pull a goal back seven minutes into the second half as Hopper headed home from a Josh Morris corner.
The Iron nearly levelled moments later but defender Charlie Goode saw his shot deflected onto the post before Kevin Van Veen's follow-up was denied by Declan Rudd.
It was the 1947 winners who sealed their place in the next round as Lookman fired past Daniels from close range in the 83rd minute.
