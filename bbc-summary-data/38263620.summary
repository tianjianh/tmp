The head of the Welsh language television broadcaster S4C Ian Jones is to step down from his post.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Mr Jones has been at the helm of the S4C since being appointed in 2011.
In a statement he said he will leave following the completion of an independent review of the channel by the UK Government next year.
He has overseen the period where more than Â£70m of annual funding for the channel was brought under the BBC licence fee.
"It's been a time of perpetual change, full of challenges and has been a privilege to work with a passionate and talented staff and some of the most talented people in the industry," said Mr Jones.
Mr Jones said he intended to continue working in the TV industry and is looking to split his time between the UK and US.
The television chief was a member of the original team that launched the station in 1982, before stints at ITV, STV and Granada, as well working in independent television production, and becoming president of National Geographic TV International.
The chairman of the S4C Authority Huw Jones paid tribute to the chief executive: "Ian has led S4C through a period of great change with energy and commitment.
"He has won the confidence of the television industry in Wales, as well as that of politicians of all parties, and has been instrumental in delivering a new highly productive partnership with the BBC."
He said the television head would remain in post until the government review is finished, also allowing a successor "to take charge in good time" before the broadcaster moves to its new headquarters in Carmarthen in 2018.
