O'Sullivan crushed Barry Hawkins 10-1 to win his sixth Masters title after taking over eight months out from playing in major events.
His break came after losing to eventual winner Stuart Bingham in the last eight of the World Championship in April.
"I just want to enjoy this week and try and peak for the Worlds and have a good run," said the 40-year-old.
It is the first time O'Sullivan has confirmed he plans to play in snooker's showpiece event, which runs in Sheffield from 16 April to 2 May.

He returned in December for the German Masters qualifying, but failed to make it through to the main stages after suffering a shock defeat by Stuart Carrington.
Earlier this month, O'Sullivan won the minor Championship League, before his success at Alexandra Palace.
"Sheffield is going to be a completely different animal. It's 17 days and you have to hold it together so much more," the Englishman added.
"There's only so many tournaments you've got in you, so as you get towards 40 you've got to start trying to savour these moments. It's just good to be playing."
Stephen Hendry, who retired in 2012, holds the record for world titles with seven.
