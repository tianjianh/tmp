Andy Murray said his "incredible" victory over Tommy Robredo in the Valencia Open final filled him with confidence for the challenges ahead.

Murray saved five match points as he overcame Robredo 3-6 7-6 (9-7) 7-6 (10-8) in three hours and 19 minutes.
The win moved him to fifth in the race to the ATP World Tour Finals in London, with ninth enough to qualify.
"I kept fighting and it stands me in good stead for the end of this year and the beginning of next," Murray said.
The British number one had also saved five match points against Robredo when he won the Shenzhen Open title in southern China in September to end a 14-month trophy drought.
Murray's third title in five weeks followed a rollercoaster match that lasted longer than any other ATP tour final this year.
"I know it was an incredible match," said the Scot. "The tennis at the end and in the second set was high level. I played well at the right moments.
"I don't know how I managed to come through it - I was very tired, Tommy was very tired as well.
"When you have to work hard for something it means more, you get more satisfaction from it."
Cheered on by a partisan home crowd, Robredo squandered chances to put Murray away in the second and third set tie-breaks.
The 32-year-old has now lost his last five meetings with Murray after winning their first two in 2006 and 2007.
"It was an amazing match, and you have to enjoy it," said the Spaniard. "Unfortunately someone has to win and it was decided by a few balls.
"Now I will be a bit out for a couple of hours but I guess that when I finish the season next week, and I watch today's match against one of the best players we have right now, I will be very happy."
