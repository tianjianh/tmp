The Tour of Britain route through Cumbria will pass through some of the areas worst hit by the winter's storms, it has been revealed.

The cyclists will cover about 118 miles (190km) from Carlisle to Kendal during the second stage on 5 September.
They will travel along the repaired A591 at Dunmail Raise and cross the temporary structure at Pooley Bridge.
The county was hard hit by the floods in December and tourism bosses hope the race will showcase its recovery.
The cyclists will also face the steep climb from Ambleside known as "the Struggle", as well as visiting Grasmere, Windermere and Bowness.
In recent years the Tour of Britain has added millions of pounds to Cumbria's economy, with last year's contribution bringing in an estimated Â£1.5m.
Councillor Keith Little, Cumbria County Council cabinet member for highways and transport, said: "Few can forget the images of devastation to the county's roads and bridges last winter, so I'm particularly pleased the route will take in many of our communities affected by the floods and includes many of the repaired roads and bridges.
"The Tour of Britain gives us a golden opportunity to show a worldwide television audience that Cumbria is very much open for business and bouncing back."
Mick Bennett, Tour of Britain race director, said: "[This] ...will be a great opportunity for the people of Cumbria to showcase their county and the beautiful scenery, while at the same time providing a stern test for the riders in what will be a challenging stage.
"The route has been designed to take in many of the communities affected by the flooding, while at the same time incorporating iconic climbs like The Struggle, so we can't wait to see the Cumbrian crowds lining the route."
