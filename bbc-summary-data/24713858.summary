Yorkshire has been named as one of the top places in the world to visit in 2014 in a new travel booklet.

Lonely Planet put the area third in the top 10 world regions, behind destinations in India and Australia.
The guide mentions Yorkshire's "rugged moorlands, heritage homes and cosy pubs" and that next year's Tour de France's grand depart will be in Leeds.
The 13th Century York Minster cathedral also makes it into the guide's top 10 global "sights to make you feel small".
The guide also refers to the success of Yorkshire athletes - including heptathlete Jessica Ennis, cyclist Ed Clancy and boxer Nicola Adams - in the 2012 Olympics, which resulted in winning seven gold medals.
It said the medals had added to the Yorkshire population's belief "their county is better than - and really the best of - all the English counties".
Gary Verity, chief executive of tourism body Welcome to Yorkshire, said: "Endorsements rarely come much better than this from a guide that has a worldwide reputation.
"This is massive for Yorkshire and our thousands of amazing tourism businesses, destinations and events."
He added the organisation had worked hard to put Yorkshire on the map because "we know how amazing and unique our county is".
Yorkshire has also previously beaten Berlin, London and Madrid to win the title of Europe's Leading Destination at the World Travel Awards.
Yorkshire Day is celebrated every year on 1 August.
In the same guide, Scotland is named as one of the top countries to visit next year as it prepares to host the Commonwealth Games in Glasgow and the Ryder Cup at Gleneagles.
The destinations featured in the book were selected after they all met certain criteria.
A Lonely Planet spokeswoman said: "It could be that there is something special going on that year, that there's been recent development and a lot of buzz about the place, or that we think it's up-and-coming and suggest travellers visit before the crowds do."
Liverpool's Cavern Club and the Abbey Road recording studios in north-west London are given special mentions for 2014, which will include the 50th anniversary of the emergence of Beatlemania.
London's Savile Row is also mentioned as "one of the best places to get dressed for success".
