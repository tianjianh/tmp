They want to speak to the men about an attack on three other men at about 03:00 on Sunday 6 September last year.
Police said the victims were approached and attacked as they crossed Bath Street, after leaving a nightclub in Elmbank Gardens.
One of the men had to go to hospital the next day to be treated for injuries to his leg.
Their attackers left the scene of the assault and headed in the direction of the Glasgow Hilton Hotel, next to the M8.
Det Con Stephen Palmer appealed for help in tracing the men in the CCTV images.
He said: "This appears to have been an unprovoked attack on a group of men heading home from a night out.
"I would appeal to anyone who recognises the men in the images to contact officers as they may be able to assist with our inquiries.
One man had brown hair and was wearing an off-white T-shirt, jeans and trainers.
A second man had dark hair and was wearing a white shirt and jeans, while the third man had dark hair and he was wearing a white shirt and black jacket.
