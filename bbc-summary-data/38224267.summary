Saracens have signed Australia forward Will Skelton on a short-term deal.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Skelton, 24, has joined the Premiership and European champions from Waratahs after the two clubs reached an agreement over his availability.
He has 18 Test appearances for the Wallabies, mainly at lock, having made his debut against France in June 2014.
"We're delighted to be able to bring a player of Will's calibre into the group," Saracens director of rugby Mark McCall told the club website.
The arrival of Skelton, who is 6ft 7in and 22st, will bolster Saracens' second-row options after the recent retirement of Alistair Hargreaves.
McCall added: "It's no secret that we have been running low on a few bodies in the second-row department, but we made it very clear that we wouldn't compromise on quality when looking to add to our squad.
"In Will, we have a player who will certainly have an important role to play in our group over the next few months."
Skelton will be available for Premiership, Anglo-Welsh Cup and European Champions Cup games during his stint at Allianz Park.
