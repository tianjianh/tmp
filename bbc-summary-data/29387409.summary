CSKA Moscow's Champions League home game with Manchester City is one of three fixtures the Russian club expect to play behind closed doors.

This is because of the violence perpetrated by fans before their 5-1 Group E defeat at Roma on 17 September.
CSKA were already due to play Bayern behind closed doors as punishment for racist chanting by fans last season.
"It is likely we will have to play all our home games behind closed doors," said CSKA general manager Roman Babaev.
"They [Uefa] could exclude us from the Champions League.
"We are going to do everything in our power to make sure this does not happen. At the moment, the whole club is going through a difficult time."
The club has been charged for the behaviour of their fans in Rome, where violent clashes with police, from which four officers and 13 stewards were left injured, forced the match to be halted.
Last season, CSKA were fined after their fans were found guilty of racist chanting during Champions League games with City and Viktoria Plzen.
City are due to play CSKA in Moscow on 21 October.
