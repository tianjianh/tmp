The process of replacing outgoing Taoiseach (Irish Prime Minister) Enda Kenny begins officially later with a meeting of his Fine Gael party.

Mr Kenny stood down as the party's leader at midnight, but will stay on as PM until his successor is chosen.
Leo Varadkar and Simon Coveney are considered favourites to lead the party but the winner would then face a Dáil (parliament) vote to become taoiseach.
The nominations deadline is expected to be 17:00 local time on Saturday.
Fine Gael's ruling body - the executive council - will meet on Thursday evening to finalise its plans for the party's leadership contest.
Mr Varadkar, the social protection minister, and Mr Coveney, the housing minister, are expected to announce their candidacies shortly.
However, Tánaiste (Deputy Prime Minister) Frances Fitzgerald has ruled herself out of the contest.
Ms Fitzgerald, who is also the current justice minister, said in a statement that she had "seriously considered contesting the leadership election".
However, she added: "I have decided that entering the contest is not the right decision for me."
Ms Fitzgerald also paid tribute to Mr Kenny saying: "His work on behalf of the country and our party has been immense and extraordinary."
Another Fine Gael veteran, Finance Minister Michael Noonan, announced his decision to step down from Cabinet after the leadership election.
Mr Noonan also confirmed that he will not contest the next general election.
In order to get their name on the ballot paper, prospective candidates must secure signatures from at least eight members of Fine Gael's parliamentary party.
The parliamentary party comprises:
There had been speculation in the media for months about Mr Kenny's future.
It followed a series of scandals involving An Garda Síochána (Irish police force) and the party's disappointing performance in the 2016 general election.
As he resigned, Mr Kenny asked the executive council to "expedite the process" and chose a new party leader by Friday 2 June.
Speaking to Irish broadcaster RTÉ, Fine Gael chairman Martin Heydon said that meant the timescale would be tighter than had originally been planned, but would be manageable.
"Anybody who wants to be nominated will need 10% of the parliamentary party to nominate them, and by Saturday evening we'll know how many runners are in the field," he said.
After nominations close, Fine Gael will then choose its leader through an electoral college system in which weighed votes are given to different branches of the party.
Mr Heydon told RTÉ that while Fine Gael members have the power to pick the new leader of their party, Dáil TDs must then vote on whether or not they become taoiseach.
"If we have a new leader of Fine Gael appointed on 2 June, the Dáil doesn't sit until the following week, for the June bank holiday, so there would be a 10-day period there before the Dáil would be back."
He said the next opportunity for the Dáil to vote on a new taoiseach would be Tuesday 13 June.
Over the last year, Mr Kenny led a minority government, which was propped up by an alliance of independent TDs and required the support of the opposition party - Fianna Fáil - to pass its budgets.
Mr Heydon added: "We have a lot of partners in government - between the Independent Alliance, our supply and confidence arrangement with Fianna Fáil.
"And I think that it is right that a new leader coming in would be given the time and space to be able to consult all of those parties, let them known their vision and our plans, to get that process in place."
Mr Kenny leaves the Fine Gael leadership as the party's most successful taoiseach.
In a statement announcing his retirement, he said it had been a "huge honour and privilege" to lead the party over the course of 15 years.
