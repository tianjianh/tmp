The American Air Museum at Duxford, Cambridgeshire, focuses on the role of US air power from 1918 to the present day.
Many of its 850 objects have never been seen before by members of the public.
The museum said the attraction tells the story of the British-American relationship in "human terms".
It includes personal accounts and the stories of people ranging from pilots to a female riveter who built aircraft, and an African-American engineer who built airfields.
Nearly 20 aircraft are on display, some suspended as if in flight.
A B25K Mitchell bomber used in WWII, a Huey helicopter operated in Vietnam and an F-111 from the Gulf War can also be seen.
The gradual redevelopment of the American Air Museum involved closing for a year.
It was originally built in the late 1990s on the old site of WWI US hangars and was designed as a memorial to the 30,000 US airmen and women killed while based in Britain during WWII.
