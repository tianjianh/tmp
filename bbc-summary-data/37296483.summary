BBC Radio Nottingham reported on Tuesday that the 28-year-old, who was a free agent after leaving German club Wolfsburg, was discussing terms and he has now agreed a two-year contract.
The Denmark international told BBC Nottingham Sport: "My main goal was to come back to England.
"What happened in Wolfsburg was a sad situation. I have made mistakes in the past, but I am looking to the future."
Bendtner had an unhappy spell in Germany and left the club after several disciplinary issues.
He said the move to a club with a "big history", and the chance to work with Forest manager Philippe Montanier, was the ideal way to make a "new start".
"It is important to prove myself and get back to scoring goals," said Bendtner.
"The coach has given me a great impression of the club and how he wants to do things.
"He cares a lot about football. He wants to play football, he is a nice man and I look forward to working with him."
Forest face Aston Villa on Sunday and Bendtner, who has scored 29 goals in 72 appearances for his country, said he was not quite ready to play.
"I need a little bit of time to settle and adjust but it won't be long," he added.
Bendtner scored 45 goals for Arsenal in 171 games between 2005 and 2014 and also had loan spells at Sunderland, Birmingham and Juventus during that period.

"Nicklas Bendtner is certainly a controversial figure and has his detractors, but Forest will be hoping that their marquee signing can combine with Britt Assombalonga up front and fire the club into top-six contention.
"He's a player who's proved he's capable of scoring goals in his career - including in the Championship during his loan spell with Birmingham, when he was only 18 and was sent out by Arsenal to gain first-team experience. That spell apart, his entire career has been spent in the top flights in England, Italy and Germany, and he has a wealth of international experience with Denmark, too.
"So, as a free agent, you can see why Forest would be prepared to offer him a deal. At 6ft 4ins tall, he's likely to be handful for Championship defenders, and is the highest-profile signing of 12 this summer."
