The yellow "be aware" warning has been issued for the Western Isles and north west Highlands for 10:00-16:00 on Wednesday.
Engineers have restored power to most of the 14,000 properties that lost electricity supplies overnight.
The remaining 1,300 customers should have power later on Tuesday.
Scottish Hydro Electric Power Distribution (Shepd) said gusts of up to 90mph hit South Uist in the Western Isles and up to 80mph elsewhere.
Severe gales with gusts of up to 75mph have been forecast for Wednesday.
During the most recent storm, the cab of an engine on a train travelling from Glasgow to Inverness via Aberdeen was damaged.
The incident happened between Keith and Elgin at about 19:00 on Monday.
The train's passengers completed their journeys by bus. No-one was injured.
A spokeswoman for ScotRail said:  "Last night, due to a striking a tree on the line between Keith and Elgin, our 14:41 Glasgow Queen Street to Inverness service returned to Keith.
"Passengers were transferred on to a later service allowing them to travel to their destination.
"We would like to thank our customers for their patience, and apologise for any inconvenience caused by circumstances outwith our control."
Network Rail said a line proving train which is used to check railway lines was struck by a falling tree at 04:00 at Clachnaharry in Inverness.
A fallen tree at Tain also reduced train speeds from about 21:50 on Monday.
Shepd, a subsidiary of energy giant SSE, said about 14,500 properties had been without power. Wick, Sutherland and Skye were among the worst affected areas.
Engineers are to travel by boat to Colonsay to restore supplies to 14 properties on the island.
The severe weather has also brought snow to upland areas, including in Lochaber, Glen Coe and the Cairngorms.
