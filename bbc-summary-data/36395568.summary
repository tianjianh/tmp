Fishlock fractured a tibia in Seattle Reign's 3-0 win over Boston Breakers on 24 April and was ruled out for between four and six weeks.
But the 29-year-old played half an hour for Seattle in a friendly against Arsenal.
She has been included in Wales' squad for the game against Norway on 7 June.
Jayne Ludlow's side are third in qualifying Group 8, five points behind leaders Austria and second-placed Norway with three games remaining.
