Traders angry at Ballynafeigh PSNI station closure

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Traders on the Ormeau Road in Belfast have complained that their local police station was closed to the public without their knowledge.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Ballynafeigh Police Station was closed on 21 February and people are now asked to attend Musgrave Street or Lisburn Road stations, except in emergency.
The closure came despite extensive work to renovate the building.
Police have said that they released a press statement about the station's closure in January this year.
A spokesperson added that the enquiry offices at the stations had been replaced with "user-friendly and conveniently located community surgeries".
A number of shop owners in the area said they had been robbed in recent weeks and were not happy with the station's closure to the public.
"I think we should have been informed," local pharmacist Gary Jones said.
"The fact that there are these lovely walls and there is nobody behind them seems like a waste of taxpayers' money."
