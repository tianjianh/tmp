The game was edging towards a goalless draw before Lucy Bronze's superb strike hit the crossbar in the 90th-minute and substitute White scored the rebound.
England, the lowest-ranked team at the event, lost their opening game to France 2-1 and play their final match against Germany on 7 March.
England are second in the table behind France who drew 0-0 with Germany.
With both England and USA yet to start their domestic seasons, the two sides were evenly matched in front of a sell-out crowd on a freezing cold night in New York.
Lionesses goalkeeper Siobhan Chamberlain denied Rose Lavelle from close range before America's Ashlyn Harris saved well to stop Nikita Parris in an even first half.
Chances were few and far between in the second period. England captain Steph Houghton went close with a 25-yard free-kick but Harris clawed the ball to safety.
Mark Sampson's side looked dangerous in the last 10 minutes and White clinched England's first ever victory in the tournament.
Match-winner White was "absolutely buzzing" that her goal had given England a famous victory.
The 27-year-old's strike gave the Lionesses just their fourth win over the World Cup holders and their first home defeat in 23 games.
White said: "To get the win, to get the goal, to beat USA on home soil; I'm pretty ecstatic to be honest.
"The team did so well, I'm so proud of them. We needed a big win in this tournament."
The team now face Germany in their final match in Washington on Tuesday.
White added: "Mark wanted us to bounce back and show our winning mentality. We definitely showed that.
"We showed the togetherness of the team, we showed drive, we showed professionalism and ultimately we scrapped [and] we fought. That's what we do."
"We're looking forward to playing Germany - this is like a final now."
