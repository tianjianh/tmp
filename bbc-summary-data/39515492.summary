Brighton boss Chris Hughton says he hopes to have defender Connor Goldson available for pre-season training after having successful heart surgery.

Goldson had preventative surgery on 30 March after an issue was detected during routine screening in February.
The 24-year-old has made 35 appearances for the Seagulls since signing from Shrewsbury Town in August 2015.
"I think as each day goes past and he feels better, he'll be more optimistic," Hughton told BBC Sussex.
"We're delighted with how it's gone and hopefully look forward to seeing him back in as quickly as possible.
"Of course being able to train in pre-season and look forward to next season, that's our hopes."
