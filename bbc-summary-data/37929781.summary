[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
PC Matthew Stocker, of Thames Valley Police, was found to have committed gross misconduct and breached the standards of professional behaviour.
He was dismissed without notice at a misconduct hearing.
The forcee said Mr Stocker, who was based in Maidenhead, used police records to find a work address for a female member of the public.
While on duty, Mr Stocker visited the female's place of work and told her colleagues that he wanted to speak to her about an investigation, which was not true, police said.
The offences took place between March and April 2016.
Det Chief Cst John Campbell said the officer's actions "undermined public confidence in the force".
