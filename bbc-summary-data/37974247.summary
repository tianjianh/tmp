Antoine Griezmann: Atletico Madrid forward doubt for derby but has not broken foot

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Atletico Madrid forward Antoine Griezmann is a doubt for Saturday's derby against Real Madrid but did not suffer a broken foot in France's 2-1 win over Sweden on Friday.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Griezmann has a haematoma on his left foot but Atletico said "an injury to the bone was ruled out" after an X-ray.
The 25-year-old is his team's top scorer in La Liga with six goals.
Atletico host league leaders Real at the Vicente Calderon trailing them by six points after 11 games.
Griezmann has returned to Madrid, meaning he will miss France's friendly against Ivory Coast on Tuesday, and will start treatment on Monday.
