Evans, 26, will fight on the undercard of his friend Andrew Selby's WBC World Flyweight Eliminator at the Motorpoint Arena in Cardiff on 26 May.
Evans shot to prominence as an amateur when he won silver as a welterweight at the London Olympics in 2012.
"It's been a long time coming, but I can't wait to be back in the ring," said Evans.
He will make his paid debut at light-welterweight in a six-round fight against a yet-to-be-named opponent.
In October 2015 Evans admitted unlawful wounding and was given a suspended jail term after punching a friend in a Gloucestershire pub.
He had also been refused accreditation to compete for Wales at the 2014 Commonwealth Games following checks by the Home Office and Games officials.
Evans announced he was turning professional in December 2015 and is now looking forward to his debut.
Evans added: "It's great to be able to start my pro career boxing in my hometown of Cardiff after spending most of my amateur career boxing away from home.
"I reached the pinnacle of an Olympic final in 2012 and now my dream is to reach the top in the pro ranks."
Evans won gold for Wales at the 2011 European Amateur Boxing Championships in Ankara in Turkey.
