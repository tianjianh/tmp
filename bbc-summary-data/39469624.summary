[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A confidential telephone line is to be set up in Mauritius for people to give information about the murder of Tyrone woman Michaela McAreavey in 2011.

It coincides with the visit to the island by her husband John McAreavey.
He has gone back to issue a fresh appeal for information about the killing.
The confidential telephone line is being set up by his lawyer in Mauritius, Dick Ng Sui Wa.
'I don't want sympathy, I want justice'
The idea is to give people who are reluctant to talk to the police, another means to provide information.
As well as the telephone hotline, there will be an address where people can post potential new evidence.
Mr McAreavey will give more details at a news conference at some stage in the next 48 hours.
He has not said anything publicly since he arrived on Saturday in the Mauritian capital Port Louis.
He is arranging meetings with the director of public prosecutions and the police.
No-one has been convicted of the murder of Mrs McAreavey, 27, the daughter of Tyrone gaelic football manager Mickey Harte.
She was strangled to death at a luxury hotel in northern Mauritius 12 days after her wedding in County Tyrone, Northern Ireland.
Before leaving for Mauritius, Mr McAreavey told the BBC he was prepared "to go to the ends of the earth to ensure that justice is achieved for Michaela".
John and Michaela McAreavey went on honeymoon to Mauritius in January 2011. She was found dead in a bath at the four-star Legends Hotel, after returning to her room to collect a packet of biscuits.
Two hotel workers - Avinash Treebhoowoon and Sandip Moneea - were later accused of murdering her and stood trial in the Mauritian capital Port Louis.
They were found not guilty of the murder.
Mauritian police launched a fresh investigation following the trial, but it came to nothing.
Mr McAreavey remarried in September last year. His wife, Tara Brennan, is an accountant from County Kildare.
He said: "I'm very, very fortunate that I've such a loving family.
"You move forward with life, you enjoy the good things, but you don't shy away from the hard things either."
