Oxford City Council approves begging ban in city centre

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Plans to ban "aggressive begging" and busking in central Oxford have been approved by the city council.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Councillors voted in favour of the introduction of a Public Space Protection Order (PSPO) at a meeting on Thursday.
The plans mean Â£100 fines could be handed out.
Green Party councillor David Thomas said he was "disappointed" and described the powers to fine beggars as "unnecessary".
"When they say 'aggressive begging', they define that as sitting still near a cash point which I don't think's aggressive," he said.
"Maybe annoying, but certainly not aggressive."
Labour-controlled Oxford City Council said it did not intend to fine beggars as a first resort, and would look to put them in contact with support services before taking further action.
Council leader Bob Price previously said the order covered a wide range of anti-social behaviour and was designed to make the area "safe and welcoming" for the public.
Campaign group Liberty had previously threatened to challenge the scope of such an order in court.
It said the council would be unfairly targeting those in poverty if it fined persistent beggars.
The council's own eight-week public consultation revealed the majority of responders had not been adversely affected by persistent begging, sleeping in toilets or busking.
