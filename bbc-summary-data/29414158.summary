A man who died in a collision with a motorbike on a Lancashire road has been named as former British international cyclist David Hitchen.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 42-year-old, from St Helens, died after his bicycle collided with a Yamaha on Rivington Road, near Belmont, on 21 September.
His wife Nicola said he rode for Great Britain in the 1990s, winning several national and international races.
She said he had been "a true talent and was a joy on the bike".
Mrs Hitchen said her husband had had a "thirst for life" and discovered "both the camaraderie and solitude that time in the saddle brings" at an early age.
His career was cut short by illness, but Mrs Hitchen said he "never lost his love of cycling and continued to support, advise and mentor anybody willing to get on a bike".
She said he had been "a truly loyal friend, a genuinely funny guy and a wonderful father".
Lancashire Police have appealed to another motorcyclist who may have filmed the collision on a helmet-mounted camera to get in touch.
