Mickey Demetriou's stunning header put the visitors in front.
But goals from Jabo Ibehre and Nicky Adams in three second half minutes helped Carlisle go from 10th to sixth.
Newport stay two points above the drop after Hartlepool lost at Cheltenham.
Carlisle's promotion hopes will rest on how their fare at fellow play-off rivals Exeter on Saturday, 6 May.
At the same time, Newport's duel with Hartlepool will rest on their game against mid-table Notts County while Hartlepool host League Two champions Doncaster.
Newport caretaker boss Mike Flynn told BBC Radio Wales: "I said a couple of games back we've got six cup finals.
"We're down to one and I want to make sure we win so we're not checking our phones or listening to the crowd on how Hartlepool are doing.
"So it's not going to be easy. Notts County have won again today against a good Blackpool team so it's going to be a tough game.
"But we've got to go and get the three points."
