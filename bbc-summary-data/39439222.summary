Police and emergency services were called to the scene at Haggardstown at about 19:20 local time. No injuries have been reported.
The fire has now been brought under control, but emergency services remain at the scene.
Residents and motorists in the area were earlier warned to keep windows closed due to toxic fumes.
That warning has now been lifted.
The chief fire officer in Louth, Eamon Woulfe, said the cause of the fire is not known.
Mr Woulfe said that the smoke was caused by upholstery in the cars, tyres, fuel in the vehicles and "there were regular explosions in the early stages".
The premises are used by GT Recovery but there were no staff on site when the fire broke out.
Mr Woulfe said that initially the blaze began in one part of the building "but it quickly spread throughout the building and quickly became uncontrollable".
"Approximately up to 90 vehicles we are told were inside and all were destroyed in the fire.
"It is a difficult fire to get completely out because the roof is after collapsing in on top of the fire.  There will be hot spots throughout that building and we expect to be here throughout the night."
A Garda (police) spokesman said they are investigating the circumstances of the fire.
