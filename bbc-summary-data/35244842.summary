Deng, 30, admitted to the BBC in December that he may not play for Great Britain again after its UK Sport funding was cut.
"We will have a dialogue and see what it takes to get him back involved in the sport in Britain," said Humby.
Britain compete in EuroBasket 2017 qualification in August.
After appearing for the team at London 2012, Deng was unable to play during EuroBasket 2015 qualifying as British Basketball - which lost Â£7m of funding in February 2014 - could not afford to insure him.
"That is a big cost and that is a problem we will have to solve," said Humby.
"I know he says that he has no will to play - we will talk to him.
"I hope he will play again for Britain. He would make a huge difference to our sport and that has to be our ambition."
Deng, who came to Britain as a refugee from South Sudan before moving to the United States as a teenager, funds a basketball school of excellence in Brixton, south London, close to where he grew up.
