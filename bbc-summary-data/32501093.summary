Wrexham have appointed Gateshead boss Gary Mills as their new manager on a one year rolling contract.

Mills, 53, succeeds Kevin Wilkin, who was sacked by the Dragons in March.
Wrexham said the priority was to find a boss to play "exciting football" and "challenge for promotion" in 2015-16.
A statement on the club website said that criteria: "These criteria were fully met by Gary Mills, whose extensive knowledge of the league and promotion made him an ideal candidate."
Mills said: "There will be no excuses here. The club [Wrexham] has everything you need to go and be successful.
"I will work so, so hard to give everyone at this wonderful club their dream of getting back into the football league."
Former Nottingham Forest midfielder Mills who took over Gateshead in September 2013, says he will be joined at the Welsh club by his assistant at Gateshead - former Tottenham midfielder Darren Caskey.
The pair led the club to third in the Conference in 2013-14 and lost the play-off final 2-1 to Cambridge United.
It is understood Mills, who previously led York City to the FA Trophy and promotion to the Football League in 2012, had also been approached by Tranmere.
He said he left the Tynesiders on good terms: "It's lovely ... as it doesn't happen very often."
A statement on the Gateshead website said: "The club will announce a new manager in due course.
"There will be no further comment from the club at this stage."
Wilkin took over at Wrexham from Andy Morrell in March 2014 on a two-year deal but was sacked a year later.
Carl Darlington was in temporary charge while the Dragons sought a replacement for Wilkin.
