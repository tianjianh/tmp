Private chambers were created in Leicester's Building for her visits to Kenilworth Castle in Warwickshire.
It was built by the Earl of Leicester, Robert Dudley, to try and win her hand in marriage, historians said.
English Heritage has installed new staircases and viewing platforms.
Head curator Jeremy Ashbee said: "Leicester's Building was one of the most spectacular works of architecture in Elizabethan England, a soaring tower expressly built to win the queen's hand in marriage.
"Visitors can now get right up to the top of this building and get a real sense of the luxury and views she enjoyed."
The new staircases take visitors up 18m (60ft) to the queen's former bedroom and views over the castle grounds and woodland.
Elizabeth I granted Kenilworth Castle to Robert Dudley in 1563 and the following year he was created Earl of Leicester.
Dudley, who shared the Queen's passion for riding and dancing, spent a fortune transforming the castle and building a garden for her.
Despite her making four visits to the tower, the last coming in 1575 and lasting for 19 days, Dudley failed to win her hand in marriage.
After the English Civil War ended in 1651, Leicester's Building was left in ruins.
