Language class demands in NI can be met by FE colleges, says UU vice-chancellor

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The vice chancellor of Ulster University (UU) has said demand for modern language learning in Northern Ireland  can be met by further education colleges.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Professor Paddy Nixon was giving evidence to the Stormont Committee for Employment and Learning.
In September, UU said it would close its school of modern languages.
He said the university was "no longer funded to provide the degrees people might like."
Responding to a question from committee chair, UUP MLA Robin Swann, Prof Nixon said that FE colleges could teach languages at the level needed in Northern Ireland.
"The FE provision in languages is actually - particularly when it's about spoken languages as opposed to what a university should be doing, which is a different thing altogether - quite extensive."
"So there is an ability for the system in Northern Ireland to support language provision at the level we need it for business and industry."
"Northern Ireland does retain an ability to train language students, but it won't be provided any longer by Ulster University."
However, he said that there had been no consultation with the FE sector on the decision to close the school of modern languages at UU.
When the school, at the Coleraine campus, closes, UU will no longer offer degrees in French, German, Chinese, Spanish and Applied Languages and Translation.
However, Queen's University in Belfast currently offers undergraduate degrees in French, Irish, Spanish and Portuguese.
Prof Nixon also defended the redundancy process currently taking place at Ulster University.
SDLP MLA, Pat Ramsey, questioned whether the process was actually voluntary.
He said: "There was not an open call through all departments."
"These are specifically aimed and targeted at specific areas, so they're not voluntary redundancies, and staff are a wee bit angered and upset by that."
However, in response, Prof Nixon said he had no plans to change the redundancy procedure to make it open to all staff.
"I don't think that will serve the strategic purpose of the university or result in us being a stronger university to face some of the other challenges that we might face," he said.
In other evidence to the committee, Prof Nixon also said that UU had no current position on whether tuition fees for students should rise.
He suggested that a graduate tax based on ability to pay might be one model for the future, but warned that long-term sustained funding for universities was central.
He also revealed that UU was seeking to treble the number of international students it attracts.
