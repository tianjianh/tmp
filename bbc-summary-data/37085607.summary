[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Kingsley Omiogate, 40, of Newton Abbot, had sex with the girl twice in 2014 after arranging to meet her via text messages.
He had denied two counts of sexual activity with a child but was found guilty at Exeter Crown Court in June.
A judge said Omiogate had groomed the girl, who can not be named, in a "systematic and planned way".

Sentencing, Ignatius Hughes QC said: "You took advantage of a child and the electronic traffic shows there were requests for pictures of her private parts, although she did not fully comply".
"There was pressure brought by you for her not to tell her family. It did not amount to blackmail but was plainly a feature of this case. There is a degree of targeting a vulnerable child", Mr Hughes said.
Exeter Crown Court heard Omiogate had groomed the girl via text messages and on Facebook and told her to keep their relationship secret.
He denied any contact had taken place but the girl's mother found the texts and online conversations.
Mary Miles, defending, said Omiogate was a devoted and dutiful father of a young daughter who he had continued to support despite being banned from seeing her since his arrest.
