The 77-year-old from St John's passed away in the early hours at an Isle of Man hospice following a short battle with cancer.
Bishop Robert Paterson led tributes to Mr Kennaugh and tweeted that he was a "great Manxman, broadcaster, farmer, raconteur and Christian".
Mr Kennaugh was married with three children.
The former president of the Manx National Farmers' Union was also captain of his parish for more than 20 years and a regular and hugely popular broadcaster on Manx Radio.
He also hosted the annual World Bonnag Championships in Dalby every March.
Bonnag, a traditional sweet bread, is thought to have been a Manx staple for hundreds of years.
Last year he appeared on BBC Songs of Praise to speak about the poetry of the Manx poet T E Brown and how he believes the island has its own soul.
"I could have chosen any career growing up but the call of the land was so strong," he said.
"It lends itself to a rounded life, a life with purpose and direction and in partnership with the god who created it all."
Manx Radio's controller of programming Marc Tyley said Mr Kennaugh was a "naturally gifted communicator who thought the best of everyone".
In a statement the Manx National Farmers' Union said he served them with "passion, loyalty and integrity" for more than 50 years.
President Brian Brumby said: "We have not only lost a true farming friend, a proud ambassador for Manx agriculture, but also an honest and respected Manxman. "
He added that Mr Kennaugh, a seventh-generation farmer, was a "true community member" and his loss was met with "great sadness."
