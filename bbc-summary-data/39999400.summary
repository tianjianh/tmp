Owner of Transocean Winner pays £400,000 coastguard bill

The owner of a 17,000-tonne oil rig which ran aground on the Western Isles last year has paid the Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA) £400,000.

The decommissioned Transocean Winner came ashore at Dalmore, near Carloway on Lewis, in a storm while being towed to the Mediterranean.
Its owner Transocean has paid the money requested by the MCA to cover costs in dealing with the incident.
The rig was eventually taken back under tow and scrapped in Turkey.
The rig's grounding last August sparked pollution fears due to the 280 tonnes of diesel on board.
Investigations found two of its four fuel tanks were damaged in the incident which resulted in the loss of 53,000 litres of fuel, most of which is thought to have evaporated with no damage to the environment.
Three weeks later it was towed to the safer anchorage at Broad Bay before being floated on to the deck of the Hawk, a semi-submersible ship used for transporting large maritime structures over long distances.
