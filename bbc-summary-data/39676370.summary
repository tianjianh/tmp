Struna scooped home from close range to haul his side level with two minutes of normal time remaining.
Kris Doolan, then Stevie Lawless, had fired Thistle ahead either side of Isma Goncalves' penalty.
The Portuguese netted from the spot after Danny Devine handled Don Cowie's shot and was shown a second yellow card.
Hearts remain four points clear of Thistle in fifth place in the Scottish Premiership but are now six adrift of the Europa League qualifying berths after St Johnstone beat Aberdeen.
Ian Cathro sent his Hearts side out in a 3-4-3 formation, with Prince Buaben at the heart of defence.
In a first half lacking highlights, it was the Ghanaian showing his defensive prowess that drew the applause of the home support, when he deftly defied a trio of Thistle attackers one after the other.
Neither goalkeeper had been involved in anything other than routine play until the 38th minute, when the visitors' Tomas Cerny was grateful to see a Struna volley canon off his crossbar, the shot coming after Devine had blocked a Goncalves effort into the wing-back's path.
The second half opened with a tale of two headers - one chance converted, one squandered.
Thistle's patient build-up was rewarded five minutes after the break, when Lawless was released down the right and his perfect cross to the back post was headed in by top-scorer Doolan.
Hearts should have answered immediately when Cowie crossed perfectly for Goncalves, but the striker contrived to head wide with the goal at his mercy.
Chris Erskine spurned a golden chance to extend Thistle's lead as he gathered Doolan's delicate pass, danced round the covering defence, but his shot clipped the leg of onrushing Hearts goalkeeper Jack Hamilton and bobble wide.
It was a controversial penalty decision by referee Andrew Dallas that changed the complexion of the game.
It looked a debatable call to reduce the visitors to 10 men, sending Devine off for handball and presenting Hearts with the opportunity to cancel out Doolan's opener.
The defender was sliding to block a Cowie shot and was adjudged to have used his hand to do so.
Devine, who had been booked 11 minutes earlier, was shown a second yellow and Goncalves slotted the spot kick to level the game.
Thistle refused to be downhearted after the harsh penalty award and they restored their lead just three minutes later when Lawless fired home after a sumptuous Erskine through ball.
Hearts piled forward again and the 10 men of Thistle could not resist, Struna netting his first goal for the club after Cerny had denied Goncalves.
The drama continued right until the end, the Firhill keeper ensuring his side left with the point they fully deserved when he thwarted the Portuguese once again after the striker was sent haring clear one-on-one.
Hearts head coach Ian Cathro: "Ultimately, it's disappointing we have not got the three points in a game where we can't say we were dominant for the entirety, but we were certainly in control in long spells throughout.
"As we push and as the game progresses, we make countless chances to be able to win the game.
"Our disappointment comes from the fact we have done more than enough to win the game.
"We wanted to make sure the pitch was a bit more open for us [by playing a back three]. And to make sure that, when we arrive in the final third, we do it with more threat. I think we did that today.
"The next step for us is to make sure, when we put in a performance like that, we generate the chances we did. These should be games that we win."
Partick Thistle manager Alan Archibald: "I think I am happy with a point. When you go down to 10 men, towards the end of the game we defended brilliantly and we took a point.
"We did have opportunities at 1-0 to maybe go to 2-0 and there may have been a different outcome, but the red card changes it as well.
"I wasn't surprised he gave the penalty in terms of how the decisions went all day. In terms of that type of decision, for a handball like that you will see another 10 of those and some will be given and some won't.
"That's the frustrating aspect from the manager's point of view. I wish they would just clear it up in black and white.
"If it hits your hand, it's either a penalty or not because we will get a different referee next time and we will get a different decision.
"It hit [Danny Devine's] arm. He has fallen to the side. He turned to block it.
"He didn't mean it and I can see why the ref's given it, but you will see another one next week that is not given. That is my frustration."
