Former England boss Roy Hodgson is keen on a return to management and believes he will do so as a "better coach".

Hodgson quit after his side suffered a shock 2-1 defeat at the hands of Iceland in the last 16 of Euro 2016.
However under Hodgson, the Three Lions became only the fifth side to reach the Euros with a 100% qualification record.
"Football is very much in my blood and very much part of my life," said the 69-year-old, who has 40 years managerial experience.
He told BBC Radio 5 live's Sportsweek: "I want to be involved in football. I feel good. If an offer comes along that I think is the right one for me and for the club, of course I shall be happy to take it."
Hodgson said he could handle the daily pressures of management, adding: "When I'm not in some way actively involved I feel a part of my life is not being fulfilled."
Hodgson had been in charge of the national side for four years after replacing Italian Fabio Capello, winning three of 11 games in major tournament finals.
Since Hodgson stepped down as England boss, the national side have parted company with Sam Allardyce and employed Gareth Southgate after a four-game interim spell.
The full interview with Garry Richardson will be on Sportsweek, Radio 5 live, from 09:00 GMT on Sunday, 11 December.
