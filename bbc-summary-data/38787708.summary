[SN]TITLE[SN]
Trainees sought for historic York windmill

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A community group which restored one of the oldest surviving five-sailed windmills in the country is seeking volunteers to train as millers.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Holgate Windmill in York reopened in 2012 following a Â£500,000 restoration project.
The 18th century Grade II-listed building currently produces about 50kg (8st) of flour a week which is sold to restaurants and individuals.
The money raised is used to help maintain the building.
The Holgate Windmill Preservation Society said training more volunteers would help increase the amount of stone-ground flour produced.
Steve Potts, chairman of the society and one of three trained millers, said the ancient skill only takes a couple of months to learn.
"It's not a reading skill, it's a doing and learning by experience skill," he said.
"We started off reasonably gradually because we're a volunteer group and it's supposed to be fun but we are trying to make more money out of the milling."
The windmill originally produced flour from the 1770s to the 1930s but fell into disrepair until the society began work to restore it in 2001.
