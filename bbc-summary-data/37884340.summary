Two Italians and a Canadian who were kidnapped in Libya in September have been released and flown to Italy, the Italian government says.

Armed men abducted the three in the south-western town of Ghat, where they were working for an Italian company doing maintenance work at the airport.
They were freed after co-operation with Libyan officials, Italy's foreign ministry said, without giving details.
There has never been any claim or public request for ransom.
Numerous criminal and armed groups are active in Libya's south-western desert.
The Italians were identified as Danilo Calonego and Bruno Cacace, and the Canadian as Frank Poccia. Their state of health was not clear.
Ghat is controlled by the Tripoli-based government of national unity.
