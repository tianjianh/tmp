John Arthur Jones, 64, of Bodffordd, Anglesey, had denied 13 charges of endangering aircraft between November 2013 and September 2014.
The alleged offences happened as planes landed at the island's Mona air strip.
Judge Geraint Walters halted the case at Mold Crown Court and a provisional date of June 2016 was set for Mr Jones' trial to start afresh.
