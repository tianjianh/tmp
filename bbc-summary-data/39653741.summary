It is believed that David Spence fell on to Paisley Road West, near Copeland Road, at about 21:20 on Wednesday, before being struck by a car.
The 79-year-old was taken to Queen Elizabeth University Hospital where he later died. The male driver of the silver Nissan Note was uninjured.
Police Scotland appealed for any witnesses to the incident to contact them.
Sgt Kenneth Canavan said: "Mr Spence is seen on CCTV crossing the road then falling to the ground where he was struck by a Nissan Note that was travelling east on Paisley Road West.
"Members of the public, including a passing paramedic, stopped to assist and Mr Spence was taken to hospital but unfortunately he died early this morning."
