NI state papers: Changes to length of time before publication

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Government papers from 1987 have been released 28 years after publication as part of phased changes that are being introduced.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
It is part of plans to release government papers after 20 years instead of the current 30 year rule.
The 1987 papers show the then Secretary of State Tom King recommended the closure of Harland and Wolff shipyard.
The details were contained in some of the almost 700 files released on Friday by the Public Records Office (PRONI).
In 1987, the Belfast shipyard was in major financial difficulties.
Eventually the yard was saved by a management and employee buy-out.
The 1987 papers also reveal that the Irish government was keen to see the demolition of the Divis Flats complex in west Belfast.
They believed it would reduce support for the IRA.
And some papers detail the security measures around the trial of several IRA members who had escaped from the Maze Prison a few years earlier.
1987 also saw the continuation of the unionist campaign of civil disobedience against the 1985 Anglo-Irish Agreement.
The year began with the launch, by Ian Paisley and Jim Molyneaux, of a petition to Queen Elizabeth calling for a referendum on the agreement.
On 14 February, the document, containing 400,000 signatures, was handed in at Buckingham Palace.
It was duly referred to the NI Secretary of State, Tom King, who rejected its central demand.
June saw the return of the Conservative government under Margaret Thatcher in the UK general election.
The chief beneficiary in Northern Ireland was the SDLP, which increased its vote at the expense of Sinn FÃ©in and succeeded in unseating UUP MP Enoch Powell in South Down.
More than 100 files from 1987 remain closed, the majority of which are individual prisoner files.
Graham Jackson from the Public Record Office of Northern Ireland said: "Annually since 1976, official records held by PRONI which were 30 years old have been reviewed with a view to making them publicly available ("the 30 year rule").
"In September 2011, the NI Assembly accepted a Legislative Consent Motion to reduce the time limit for release from 30 years to 20 years ("the 20 year Rule").
"The 20 year rule is being phased in over 10 years, with two years worth of records being reviewed and released each year.
"This is the third year of the phasing-in period; which see the records of the NI departments and the NIO with terminal dates of 1987 brought forward for review and release in August 2015 and the records with terminal dates of 1988 brought forward in December 2015."
