Charlton Athletic 2-1 Southend United

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Southend's League One play-off ambitions took a blow after a defeat by struggling Charlton at The Valley.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
An Adam Thompson own goal for the Addicks in the 74th minute leaves Phil Brown's side a point behind sixth-placed Millwall.
Karl Robinson's men had only won one out of their previous 14 matches heading into the contest but got off to a great start after six minutes when Ricky Holmes managed to fire his shot past Christian Walton.
Brown's side quickly responded when John White headed home from Michael Timlin's pinpoint corner with 11 minutes played.
After the break, an Addicks corner caused chaos in the Shrimpers' penalty area as Josh Magennis' overhead kick deflected off a Southend player which had to be cleared off the line.
After 61 minutes, Stephen McLaughlin was put through by Simon Cox but Declan Rudd did well to deny the midfielder.
Charlton then took the lead after 74 minutes when Nathan Byrne's cross was flicked on by substitute Jake Forster-Caskey before the ball came off Southend defender Thompson to concede an unfortunate own-goal.
The Addicks survived a late onslaught including a Franck Nouble header to seal all three points.
