[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
From becoming the heavyweight champion of the world to serenading his wife with an Aerosmith classic, Tyson Fury had a night to remember in Germany.

And his antics caught the imagination of audiences around the world as social media feeds caught fire with talk of the British boxer.
Approximately 151,000 tweets were sent about Fury in the hour he was crowned champion, with people from Auckland to the Philippines discussing the fight.
Former cricketer Andrew Flintoff burst into song, while the internet responded with its usual mix of gifs, memes and jokes.
BBC Sport takes a look at the best social media had to offer...
Approximately 262,521 tweets about Fury were sent from people around the world during and after the fight.
At one stage the Manchester boxer was trending as far away as New Zealand.
The Bleacher Report produced this gif, which refers to the time Fury did indeed punch himself in the face during a fight as he attempted an uppercut against Lee Swaby.
Watford captain Troy Deeney tweeted to say he had won £8,000 on the Fury fight. Earlier in the day the Birmingham City fan scored against Aston Villa in a 3-1 win.
Former England cricketer and one-fight boxer Andrew Flintoff was watching the bout in Australia and filmed himself singing along to Fury's version of the Aeorsmith classic 'I Don't Want to Miss a Thing'.
On English-language social media Fury drew plenty of attention - but not as much as Leicester striker Jamie Vardy, who set a new record Premier League record on Saturday having scored in 11 matches in a row.
Vitalii Sych, editor of Novoye Vremya weekly:  "Friends, let's face it, Klitschko lost today. It was obvious. And the judges are not to blame… Wladimir is a superior boxer to the British Yeti. But for some reason, he lost today. I think he has every chance to learn a lesson and knock this guy out in a rematch."
Journalist Peter Shuklinov: "Wladimir, whether you take revenge or not, whether you win or lose, whether you retire now or in 10 years - whatever happens, thank you! You taught Ukrainians to believe in victory so strongly that no one can allow even the thought of defeat. We should look up to you and build the country with the same belief in ourselves. Thank you for all these years of craftsmanship. We are with you anyway."
Sergey Naumovich, human rights activist from Donetsk: "Let's admit that Klitschko lost unambiguously. Age takes its toll. And even 5-7 years ago, it would have been difficult for Wladimir to beat such a bulky and raving wardrobe."
