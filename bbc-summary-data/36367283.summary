Manchester United could make striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic their first signing of the Jose Mourinho era.

Sweden international Ibrahimovic is out of contract after deciding to leave French champions Paris St-Germain.
As well as interest from United, the 34-year-old has been made lucrative offers from clubs in China.
However, he has spoken warmly of his experience of working with Mourinho in the past and is the kind of stellar name United are looking to attract.
Mourinho, 53, is expected to take over from Louis van Gaal after his representatives met with United officials on Tuesday.
Whilst the Old Trafford club retain the ability to pay huge wages given their record turnover figures, which are set to exceed Â£500m this year, they recognise a failure to qualify for the Champions League for the second time in three years severely limits their ability to bring in the biggest names.
Ibrahimovic is obtainable and is keen to experience the Premier League, having already made an impact in the Netherlands, Italy, Spain and France.
He has won 13 league titles in those four leagues, including the two he secured at Juventus that were subsequently revoked due to the Calciopoli scandal.
Another was won with Mourinho, at Inter Milan in 2009, when Ibrahimovic was named Serie A's player of the year and won goal of the season.
The forward has spoken recently of how he wishes he had continued the relationship with Mourinho, rather than moving on to Barcelona.
Despite his age, Ibrahimovic remains one of the biggest names in the game.
United have not had great success with such signings recently. They paid huge wages to Angel di Maria and Radamel Falcao at the start of Van Gaal's two years in charge but both players left Old Trafford after a single season.
