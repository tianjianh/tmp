A investigation between the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) and the Garda Síochána led to the discovery of the drug in vehicles on Derrymacash Road in Lurgan on Friday.
The men, aged 32, 36 and 59, are being held on a number of drugs offences.
The PSNI's Det Insp Tom McClure said the seizure had "taken a substantial amount of drugs out of circulation".
"We are aware of the threat posed by illegal drugs and are determined to use every opportunity to take controlled drugs off the streets and to bring anyone involved in their sale, supply or distribution before the courts," he added.
