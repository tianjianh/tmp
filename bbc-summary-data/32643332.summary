Election 2015: Big majorities for Tories in Herefordshire and Worcestershire

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
There have been big increases in Conservative majorities as the party won a clean sweep of seats across Herefordshire and Worcestershire.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
MP for Worcestershire West, Harriet Baldwin, added more than 15,000 votes to her majority.
Jesse Norman added an extra 14,000 while winning Hereford and Herefordshire South for the Tories.
The Conservatives held all the seats in both counties. UKIP have taken second place in four constituencies.
The Liberal Democrats performed poorly across the region.
Bromsgrove once again proved to be the safest of safe Conservative seats, with Government minister Sajid Javid polling more than 50% of the vote.
Bill Wiggin increased his majority in Herefordshire North by more than 10,000 votes, as did Mark Garnier in Wyre Forest.
"The polls were neck and neck as we went into this general election and so we really need to see what happens and how negotiations, if need be, take place as to what actually ends up happening in Westminster and in Downing Street," Mr Wiggin said.
There's a new Conservative MP in Mid Worcestershire - Nigel Huddlestone added 5,000 to the majority in the seat formerly held by Tory defence minister Peter Luff.
Mr Huddlestone said: "I'd like to thank the people of Mid Worcestershire for putting their trust in me and giving me more votes than I anticipated, more votes than I dreamt of, to be honest."
Robyn Walker was returned as Conservative MP for Worcester, with a majority of 5,646, and Karen Lumley successfully defended her Redditch seat.
Mr Walker said: "The fact that it was such an increase in the turnout shows that we have been winning votes from new areas, from other parties and winning votes across the whole city of Worcester."
