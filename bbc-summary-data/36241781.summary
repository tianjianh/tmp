A pigeon loft containing dozens of prize-winning birds was destroyed in a Somerset arson attack.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Crews were called out to Hulk Moor Drove, near Street, just after 22:00 BST on Saturday, where they found the pigeon loft, a caravan and several outbuildings alight.
The fire follows the theft of pigeons from the same address 12 months ago.
Devon and Somerset Fire and Rescue said the cause of fire was deliberate and an investigation is under way.
The owner of the birds, Stuart Russell, has bred pigeons for at least 50 years.
Posting on Facebook, his daughter Pat Russell wrote both her parents were "devastated by this cruel act".
"It was a year ago yesterday he had most of his pigeons stolen," she added.
Five engines were at the scene until 04:00 BST on Sunday.
