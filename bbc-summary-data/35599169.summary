Nigeria FA warns Oliseh but no fine yet

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) has released a statement reacting to recent comments by Super Eagles coach Sunday Oliseh.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The NFF Executive Committee: "rebuked Oliseh for his unwarranted statements unbecoming of a National Team Coach in both regular and social media."
While his apology was acknowledged he was warned over future behaviour.
However the statement did not elaborate whether the possibility of a fine had been removed.
The NFF's disciplinary committee may still want to sanction him for his outburst aimed at the local media as well as his vociferous former international teammates.
Oliseh, 41, apologised to his employers after he caused controversy by posting an extraordinary eight-minute video rant on his own website to hit back at what he called the "insanity" of his critics.
In a statement the NFF added: "In line with global best practices, the Committee decided that coach Oliseh MUST henceforth report to the NFF General Secretary and the Technical and Development Committee, and should be ready to defend his entire program before the Committee, including invitation of players and training programs."
Oliseh, unpaid for five months, had initially gone public with the money problems affecting his team during the 2016 African Nations Championship (CHAN) tournament - where Nigeria failed to get past the group stages - to the embarrassment of his employers.
Nigeria face seven-time African champions Egypt in back-to-back 2017 African Cup of Nations fixtures next month.
They are two points behind group leaders Egypt after two rounds of matches with only group winners guaranteed automatic qualification to the tournament in Gabon.
Super Falcons
Meanwhile, Nigeria have begun their search for a competent high-profile expatriate coach for the women's national team after the Super Falcons failed to qualify for the Rio 2016 Olympics women's football event.
Former captain Florence Omagbemi, who is expected to assist the incoming expatriate, has been named as acting manager as the NFF hopes to name a substantive manager "within the shortest possible time".
Omagbemi will be assisted by former international teammates Perpetua Nkwocha and Ann Chiejine, with Bala Mohammed as goalkeeper trainer.
Promotion
Emmanuel Amuneke, who led the country to a fifth Fifa Under-17 World Cup in Chile last year, has been promoted to the head coach of the under-20 side.
