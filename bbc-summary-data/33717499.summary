The Giant's Causeway came top, with 790,000 visits, followed by Titanic Belfast (630,000), the Ulster Museum (470,000) and Derry's Walls (370,000).
In a survey of overnight stays in local government districts, one in four stays were in Belfast, with Causeway Coast and Glens coming in second.
Castlereagh and Lisburn was the least popular area for overnight trips.
The figures were contained in a Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency report.
It identified visitor numbers to each of Northern Ireland's 11 local government districts and their most popular attractions.
Tourism Ireland CEO Niall Gibbons said the growth in holidaymakers coming to Northern Ireland from overseas was encouraging.
"Overseas tourism delivers some Â£446m for the Northern Ireland economy, helping to sustain valuable employment in communities right across the province.
"And, I am pleased to report that sentiment in general for 2015 from our tourism partners overseas (including tour operators and carriers), as well as our industry partners around Northern Ireland (including hoteliers and visitor attractions such as Titanic Belfast), is largely optimistic."
