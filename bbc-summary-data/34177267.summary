[SN]TITLE[SN]
Suspended sentence for child rape video woman, 19

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A 19-year-old woman who downloaded videos of children being raped has been given a suspended prison sentence.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Chloe Dunn from Portsmouth had received what the judge called "sick and perverted" videos involving children aged under five.
She had also corresponded online about wanting to have sex with children.
Dunn admitted receiving some of the videos at Burnley Crown Court and was given an eight-month sentence, suspended for two years.
The court heard how Dunn, of Eastern Road, corresponded with Sheldon Bateson, 29, from Nelson, Lancashire, about child porn in April 2014.
At her request he sent her videos, classed in the most serious category of indecent images, of young children being raped by adults.
The pair went on to chat online about their desire to meet in person and have sex with children.
Bateson pleaded guilty at Burnley Crown Court to distributing and possessing indecent images and was jailed for three years and four months.
The correspondence and videos were uncovered when Bateson's phone was later sold at a second-hand phone shop.
The phone was traced to Bateson and it emerged he distributed 17 videos and numerous images to a number of people he was in contact with on the internet.
Barry White, defending Dunn, described her as "naive and vulnerable with a desire for a relationship and for someone to find her attractive".
In mitigation, both the defendants said they were engaged in "fantasy role play".
Judge Beverley Lunt ruled it was "not appropriate" to send Dunn, who was 17 at the time of the offences, to immediate custody as she would be "extremely vulnerable in a custodial setting".
Judge Lunt also pointed out there was currently no sex offender treatment programmes for women, which she labelled "short-sighted".
Dunn was ordered to sign the Sex Offenders Register.
