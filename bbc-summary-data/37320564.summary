Amina Al-Jeffery: Deadline to return 'locked up' woman

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A father who is claimed to have kept his daughter locked up against her will in Saudi Arabia has until Sunday to return her to Britain.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Amina Al-Jeffery, 22, who was born and brought up in Swansea, was taken to Jeddah in 2012 by her father, Mohammed, who said he did it to "save her life".
Mr Al-Jeffery denied the allegations at the High Court.
In August, Mr Justice Holman said she had been "deprived of her liberty" and her father must facilitate her return.
Swansea West MP Geraint Davies said Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson must "secure Amina's right to liberty" if her father did not comply with the court order.
Delivering the court order last month, Mr Justice Holman said Mr Al-Jeffery "must permit and facilitate the return of Amina if she so wishes to Wales or England and pay the airfare" by 11 September.
However, the judge accepted there was "little or nothing this court could do" to enforce the order if Mr Al-Jeffery "was determined not to comply with it".
But he said Mr Al-Jeffery might face contempt of court proceedings if he returned to Britain without having complied.
Ms Al-Jeffery, who has dual nationality, said her father took the action against her will after she "kissed a guy".
