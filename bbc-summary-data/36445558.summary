3D visuals to light up XpoNorth festival in Inverness

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Glasgow School of Art (GSA) has announced details of its contribution to Inverness' creative industries festival, XpoNorth.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
It will include a presentation of 3D visualisations of heritage sites GSA helped to create in a project called The Scottish Ten.
Images of Maeshowe in Orkney, India's Rani-ki-Vav and the Sydney Opera House in Australia will be featured.
GSA will also stage a fashion show, panel discussions and a workshop.
The school of art does work in the Highlands and Islands from a campus it has in Forres.
XpoNorth will also involve music, film premieres and video gaming events to be held at venues across Inverness on 8 and 9 June.
Maeshowe is a Neolithic chambered cairn, while Rani-ki-Vav is what is known as a stepwell that was built on the banks of the Saraswati River and initially constructed as a memorial to a king in the 11th Century.
The Sydney Opera House is one of the world's most recognisable landmarks.
