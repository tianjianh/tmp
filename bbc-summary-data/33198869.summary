The children from Rhos Primary, Swansea, were on a trip to The Mumbles, on Tuesday when they went missing.
Police said they were called out and the pupils were reunited with a teacher about 10 minutes later.
School governor Councillor Alex Thomas said: "There is an investigation going on to find out exactly what happened and how it came about."
He said: "This is a concerning incident. I completely understand why parents are worried.
"The school, council and governing body are taking it seriously."
Mr Thomas said he wanted to wait until the investigation had reported back before commenting further.
A South Wales Police spokesman said: "Police received a report that a small number of children had wandered off during a school visit to Mumbles on Tuesday afternoon.
"Around 10 minutes after the call was received, the children were reunited with a teacher and no further police action was required."
