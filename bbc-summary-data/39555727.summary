[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Andrew Salina was found seriously injured at his home in Roystonhill at about 03:30 after emergency services were alerted to a disturbance.
He was subsequently pronounced dead at the scene by paramedics.
DCI Paul Livingstone said it appeared a weapon had been used in the "violent incident" and appealed for information about three men seen in the area.
Detectives from Police Scotland's major investigation team are treating the death as a murder. Officers were conducting door-to-door inquiries, with specialist forensic teams at the scene and additional patrols in the area.
Mr Livingstone said: "I am asking for the assistance of the local community to come forward with any information you may have. It is possible you witnessed or heard a disturbance in Roystonhill at the junction with Millburn Street at around 03:30 hours.
"We also understand that three men were seen entering the area in a small light coloured car and were seen leaving the area in the same vehicle following the alleged incident.
"I want to reassure the local community that we are doing everything we can to find out what took place and determine who is responsible for the death of Andrew Salina. Additional officers are patrolling Royston and I would ask anyone with any information or concerns to speak with them today."
