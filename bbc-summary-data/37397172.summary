Emmanuel Adebayor: Lyon pull out of deal amid Cup of Nations concerns

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Lyon have pulled out of a move to sign former Arsenal, Manchester City and Tottenham striker Emmanuel Adebayor.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Adebayor, a free agent after Crystal Palace released him, had flown to Lyon and met coach Bruno Genesio on Friday.
But the Ligue 1 club were unhappy at the prospect of losing him for up to two months of this season to play for Togo at the Africa Cup of Nations.
Lyon indicated that the 32-year-old's ineligibility for the Champions League group stage was another issue.
Clubs had to name their squads for the group stage by 1 September, with no changes allowed - even for free agents - until the knockout rounds begin.
Genesio, who signed 19-year-old forward Jean-Philippe Mateta from third-tier Chateauroux on Thursday, had considered a move for another forward following an injury to Alexandre Lacazette.
Lyon said in a statement that they were happy signing only Mateta after Adebayor "confirmed he wishes to play in the Africa Cup of Nations in early 2017, which would mean an absence of a month or two".
The Cup of Nations will take place in Gabon between 14 January and 5 February.
