The scrum-half, who turned 31 on Wednesday, arrived at the Cherry and Whites from Edinburgh in 2014.
His contract at Kingsholm was due to expire at the end of this term.
"At this stage of my career, the offer to test myself and develop my game even further in a different environment was just too good to turn down," he said.
Laidlaw, who can also play at fly-half, added to Gloucester's club website: "It's not been an easy decision to make, but I think it's the right one.
"It's a fantastic club which enjoys tremendous support. The squad contains a great group of boys, I love playing at Kingsholm and it's been a genuine honour to captain the side."
He has scored 480 points in 48 appearances for Gloucester and helped them beat his hometown club Edinburgh to win the Challenge Cup in 2015.
Director of rugby David Humphreys added: "His consistent performances at both club and international level, particularly his goal-kicking, have caught the attention of some of the biggest clubs in Europe.
"While we are sorry to see him go, the offer Greig received from France was too good to turn down and, at the end of the season, we will wish him all the best for the rest of his career."
Laidlaw has agreed a three-year deal with Clermont, who finished top of the French top flight last season before losing in the play-off semi-finals.
