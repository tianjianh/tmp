Police hunting for two escaped killers have found evidence in a New York cabin after a witness reported seeing a man fleeing from the home.

ABC News reported that DNA, found on food near the campsite, is linked to the two escapees.
A pair of prison-issue underpants was also found in the cabin, according to the New York Times.
The two escapees, Richard Matt, 49, and David Sweat, 35, disappeared 17 days ago on 6 June.
The discovery has shifted the search to an area 20 miles (32km) west of the site of the prison break.
They escaped from Clinton Correctional Facility in Dannemora, New York, through tunnels, using power tools to escape from their cells.
"We have recovered specific items from cabins and forwarded them to labs and got conclusive information,  but we will not confirm what it found," said New York State Police Major Charles Guess at a news conference on Monday.
Police had been searching heavily on a rural area close to the Pennsylvania state line on Monday in Friendship, 300 miles (480km) south of the prison.
On Saturday police responded to a sighting of two men walking along a railway in the area. That sighting is still unconfirmed.
"No lead is too small for us to investigate," Mr Guess said.
Prison employee Joyce Mitchell has been arrested for possibly helping them escape and giving the pair the tools.
Ms Mitchell was planning on meeting the duo with a getaway car, but changed her mind.
Matt was sentenced to 25 years to life for kidnapping and dismembering his former employer in 1997. Sweat was serving life without parole for killing a sheriff's deputy in 2002.
