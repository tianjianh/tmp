Jayden Wilson, from Basingstoke, was given a year to live in September 2013 when he was diagnosed with a malignant brain tumour.
Jayden's father Michael Wilson, who was unmasked as Spider-Man, said he died peacefully in his bed on Christmas Eve.
The video has been viewed more than eight million times on YouTube.
Writing on the Hope For Jayden Facebook page, he said: "Jayden fought an amazing battle. By far he was the bravest person we know.
"Jayden had such a happy life. What an incredible five years."
Mr Wilson said he and his wife told their young daughter Ella of the news on Boxing Day.
He added: "We wanted to ensure Ella enjoyed her Christmas Day, and not [for it] to be a sad, emotional one.
"We now remember Jayden as that cheeky little chappy, always smiling, playing with his favourite toys, on his scooter, enjoying school, and playing with his friends x will never forget this little Spartan Warrior x."
Jayden was diagnosed with a "grade four" brain tumour - the fastest-growing and most malignant - after undergoing a CT scan following a bump on the head last year.
Mr Wilson said 2015 would be a year to "give back" by raising money for the Naomi House Children's Hospice in Hampshire, which cared for Jayden, and the charity Children with Cancer.
