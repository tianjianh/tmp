Dundee's Olympia swimming pool to close for repairs

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Dundee's Olympia swimming pool is to close for five weeks for repair works - 18 months after opening.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The £33.5m pool at East Whale Lane opened in June 2013.
A Dundee City Council spokeswoman confirmed the pool would close for five weeks for "essential snagging works" to fix minor defects from Monday, 5 January.
The centre's fitness studio and cafe will remain open throughout the works, which run until 9 February.
The old Olympia pool at the city's waterfront was demolished to make way for the V&A Dundee design museum.
The project to replace it ran £2m over budget for improvements, which included extra water proofing.
