Premier League predictions: Lawro v Steve Cram & Brendan Foster on opening weekend

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Premier League is back - but who will come out on top in the opening round of fixtures?

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
BBC Sport's football expert Mark Lawrenson has made his predictions for the first 10 games of the new campaign, which include Arsenal hosting Leicester on Friday night, champions Chelsea against Burnley on Saturday and last season's runners-up Tottenham against newly promoted Newcastle on Sunday.
You can make your own predictions now - take on Lawro and other fans and try to take your team to the top of the leaderboard by playing the new-look BBC Sport Predictor game.
Lawro will be making a prediction for all 380 Premier League games this season against a variety of guests.
His opponents for the opening round of Premier League fixtures are BBC athletics commentators Brendan Foster and Steve Cram.
Foster, who supports Newcastle, and Sunderland fan Cram saw their teams swap divisions last season, with the Magpies promoted back to the Premier League at the same time as the Black Cats went down.
"It's great to have my team Newcastle back in the Premier League," said Foster. "Particularly - and he is standing next to me laughing as I say this - because Steve's team are not in the Premier League any more. So that is good news."
Cram is not confident Sunderland will bounce straight back to the top flight either, adding: "I have got friends who are a bit worried that we are going to go straight down again.
"It is not going to be easy and I would be amazed if we won promotion this season. I am always hopeful and always look on the positive side... but I don't sound confident, do I?
You can hear more of their tales of Tyne-Wear derby banter and the mixed fortunes of north east of England football clubs on Football Focus at 12:00 BST on Saturday on BBC One and the BBC Sport website.
A correct result (picking a win, draw or defeat) is worth 10 points. The exact score earns 40 points.
