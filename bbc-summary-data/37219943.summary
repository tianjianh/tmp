Inquiry into death at house hit by lorry in Fairlie

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A fatal accident inquiry is to be held into the death of a woman after a lorry crashed into her North Ayrshire home.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Catherine Bonner, 55, was killed and her partner, Jim McColl, 55, was badly hurt in the crash in Fairlie in 2013.
The driver George Marshall, 53, was charged with causing death by dangerous driving. The Crown later dropped this after studying his medical background.
A preliminary hearing into the crash has been scheduled for next month with full proceedings expected in January.
The HGV coal lorry driven by Mr Marshall ploughed into Ms Bonner and Mr McColl's ground-floor flat on Main Road at about 13:45 on 14 February 2013.
The couple had been watching television at the time and became trapped under rubble. Ms Bonner died from her injuries.
The crash caused extensive damage to the building which was split into five homes.
Months later, police said that Mr Marshall had been charged with causing death by dangerous driving.
However, the then Lord Advocate, Frank Mulholland, later said that after fully considering all the medical evidence available, the Crown had decided there would be "no further criminal proceedings at this time in relation to George Marshall".
The Crown Office has now announced that a Fatal Accident Inquiry will be held into the crash.
