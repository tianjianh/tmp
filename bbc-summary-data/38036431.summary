[SN]TITLE[SN]
Eastleigh 0-3 Chester

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Eastleigh suffered a promotion setback with a demoralising home loss to Chester.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The home side made the early running, but the visitors capitalised against the run of play. Johnny Hunt crossed for Kane Richards to stab the Blues into a 20th-minute lead.
Mikael Mandron missed two good chances to score for the hosts, which proved a turning point.
The Blues extended their advantage, despite a heroic penalty save by goalkeeper Scott Brown from Tom Shaw. In the ensuing scramble, Elliott Durrell poked in.
In their strenuous efforts to fight back, Eastleigh inadvertently gave Jordan Chapell the freedom of Ten Acres to race clear on the break and make it three.
