Jordan McClaren, from Perth, was handed a ticket for the Imps' clash with Macclesfield Town by an anonymous fan.
Lincoln City won the game 2-1 to secure promotion to League Two.
Mr McClaren, 37, who was born in Lincoln, flew to the UK via Dubai and Rome to be at the match.
He said "I'm so happy to be here. I didn't have a ticket but when I arrived at the station a lovely lady handed me one of her friend's who couldn't make it. I am so thankful.
"I've followed Lincoln City all my life and I had to get over to sample the atmosphere.
"It's been a incredibly magical day that will stay with me forever. For the supporter to give up their ticket for me was just amazing, such a precious gift.
"I've got until Monday to celebrate and I plan to make the most of every hour."
