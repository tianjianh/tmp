Harry Arter: Bournemouth midfielder agrees new three-year contract

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Bournemouth midfielder Harry Arter has agreed a new three-year contract with the Premier League club.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 26-year-old joined the Cherries from non-league Woking in June 2010 and has been part of two promotions.
He made 21 appearances in the top flight last season and was unfortunate to be ruled out of the Republic of Ireland's Euro 2016 squad with injury.
Arter follows team-mates Adam Federici, Adam Smith and Steve Cook in signing new deals at Bournemouth.
