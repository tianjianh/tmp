[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
One hundred of the most inspirational women across the world in 2015 have been named by the BBC.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
This year's list marks the third year of the 100 Women season, which seeks to better represent women in the BBC's international news output.
Oscar-winning actress Hilary Swank and Sudanese supermodel Alek Wek are both included on the list.
It also features 30 entrepreneurs under the age of 30 and inspiring women over the age of 80.
The list also includes nurses on the front line, young female film-makers documenting the pressures and expectations in their community and leaders in science, politics, education and the arts.
One of our octogenarians, 84-year-old Argentinean activist Estela de Carlotto, works to reunite grandparents with the missing children of those who were snatched as babies by the 1970s and 80s' military junta.
She was reunited with her grandson Ignacio in 2014.
Younger by two generations, our entrepreneurs share their tips for getting ahead.
Austrian Antonia Albert, aged 25, co-founded Careship, an online marketplace for elderly care.
She advises women to be "much more confident and have the guts to take risks".
Our list spans the world, from Li Tingting, an openly gay women's rights activist in China, to Eveles Chimala, a midwife in Malawi, Jana el-Hassan, a Lebanese novelist and Megan Grano, an American comedian.
Some of our women are remarkably brave, such as Neyda Rojas, a Venezuelan nun who visits the country's overcrowded prisons - some of the most dangerous in the world.
The season kicks off with two weeks of thought-provoking broadcast and online stories.
Our coverage from India includes a focus on the girls born in the western state Maharashtra who were named 'nakusha', or 'unwanted', but were finally given their own names four years ago.
Women from Tehran and London share why they do not want to have children - and describe the societal pressures to do so.
And in the Middle East, we speak to the 'Malala of Syria', Muzzon al-Mellehan. The 16-year-old refugee in Jordan is urging refugee girls to study and go to school.
The season culminates in a day of debates on image, leadership and relationships at 100 locations around the world, including Albania, Kosovo, Samoa, Fiji, Israel and Jamaica - and at the BBC's headquarters in London.
The BBC News 100 Women season runs online, on BBC World News TV, on BBC World Service as well as on our 28 global languages services from 18 November to 2 December.
