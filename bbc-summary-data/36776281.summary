The 17-strong team also includes North Belfast's Leitrim native Breege Connolly plus Donegal athletes Mark English and Brendan Boyce.
Mageean won a bronze medal at the European Championships on Sunday.
Pollock, 30, emphasised his readiness for Rio by finishing top Irishman in the half marathon in Amsterdam.
Holywood runner Pollock's weekend performance answered the criticism of his Olympic selection.
Pollock was preferred to Sergio Ciobanu for one of Ireland's marathon spots even though his qualifying time was 24 seconds slower than the Moldovan-born athlete.
Ciobanu appealed against his Rio omission in May but his plea was unsuccessful.
The Irish selectors were swayed by Pollock's impressive 14th place at the World Half Marathon in March and his previous good performances in major championships.
On Sunday, Pollock finished three minutes and 18 seconds ahead of Ciobana.
The Irish squad includes former world champion walker Robert Heffernan who looks set to be upgraded from fourth place to a bronze medal in the 50K at London 2012 following a drugs ban imposed on Russian winner Sergey Kirdyapkin.
