Nineteen people, including at least two children, were found in the Bulgarian-registered vehicle close to Bicester Village on Wednesday evening.
A Home Office spokesman said the group was made up of people from Iran, Iraq, Afghanistan and Pakistan, included 15 males and a family of four.
One man arrested at the scene has been released without charge.
Police pulled over the lorry on the A41 between the junction of the M40 and a Tesco store.
The men remain in custody on suspicion of entering the UK illegally, three of whom claimed to be aged under 18.
The family has been released and must report to immigration authorities while their cases are considered.
A spokesman said: "We were called at 5.47pm to a report that there were people in the back of a lorry on the A41, Bicester. We arrived and arrested a man on suspicion of immigration offences. He has now been released with no further action."
He added the force is helping immigration authorities with their investigation.
