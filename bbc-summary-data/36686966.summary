The 18-year-old won in a quick time of 47.58 seconds ahead of Belgium's Pieter Timmers (47.80) and American defending champion Nathan Adrian (47.85).
British teenager Duncan Scott finished a superb fifth, equalling the British record of 48.01 he set in the heats.
Australia's Cameron McEvoy, the pre-race favourite, came seventh.
Scott, who is from Glasgow, was the seventh fastest qualifier for Wednesday's final and produced an impressive display in a strong field.
"I am delighted with that," the 19-year-old told BBC Sport.
"I was happy to make the semi-final and to be in that final was incredible. Hopefully things can move on next year.
"Everyone in the GB team is swimming with confidence at the moment. We have the best breaststroker ever in Adam Peaty and the whole team wants to keep winning."
