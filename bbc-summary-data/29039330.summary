Dog lead mother Jacqueline Angrave jailed after appeal

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A mother who walked her daughter to school on a dog lead during a "campaign of cruelty" has been jailed at the second time of asking.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Jacqueline Angrave, 48, from Leicester, was convicted of two counts of child cruelty in July but was handed a suspended sentence.
However, judges at the Appeal Court in London have jailed her for two years.
It follows a bid by the Attorney General, Jeremy Wright QC, to have her "unduly lenient" punishment increased.
Lord Justice Treacy told the hearing Angrave carried out the campaign of abuse, which included physical attacks, when her daughter was aged between five and 10, from 1997 to 2003.
He said: "The offender used to walk her to school using a dog lead when she was aged between seven and 10.
"[She] took care to see no-one was able to observe this by removing the lead before they arrived at the school gate."
Angrave, of Hughenden Drive, would also drag her daughter by the hair, punch, kick and scratch her, and force her to take cold showers while rubbing shampoo and soap into her eyes.
"It seemed to the victim that the offender was taking pleasure in hurting her," the judge told the hearing.
The daughter also suffered psychological cruelty, with Angrave blaming the girl for her own problems, the court heard.
"The impact of this campaign of relentless insults was to destroy the victim's self-esteem and to blight her childhood," Lord Treacy said.
A pre-sentence report said Angrave continued to show no remorse, while reports showed she suffered from diabetes, failing eye sight and some mental health problems.
However, the judge ruled these were not reason enough for her to avoid a custodial sentence.
