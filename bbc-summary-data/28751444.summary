University of Gloucestershire shares student village plan

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Plans to turn a former teaching campus of the University of Gloucestershire into a student village have been shared publicly for the first time.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Cheltenham's Pittville Campus was closed as a teaching facility in 2011 but 200 students still live on site.
Now the university wants to increase the accommodation to 794 students and build a bar, refectory, gym, shop, cafÃ©, games area and more.
A public consultation into the plans runs until the end of the month.
Some university professional services staff will move to work at the site for pastoral care and other support.
It is hoped that, subject to planning permission, work will start at the campus early next year and it will be ready for students by the autumn of 2016.
The campus is open from 09:00-18:00 BST, Monday to Friday until 26 August, for members of the public to view exhibition boards and leave feedback.
The university, which has three campuses in Cheltenham and Gloucester, is used by 9,000 undergraduate students and 1,000 postgraduate students and it has 1,000 staff.
