A record number of people in the UK, some 14,570, are surviving to the age of 100, the latest official data shows.

The number of people aged 100, or over, has quadrupled over the last two decades, according to Office for National Statistics figures for 2015.
In the last decade alone, the number of centenarians has risen by 65% or 5,720
There has also been a dramatic increase in the number of people aged over 105. Last year there were 850 reaching the age of 105, up from 130 in 1985.
The figures come as statisticians publish information on the life expectancy of the UK population.
Those born between 2013 and 2015 can expect to live to the age of 79 if they are a boy and 82 if they are a girl.
This was working on the assumption that mortality rates remain the same as they are now, the ONS said.
Life expectancy had increased by 13 weeks a year since the 1980 to 1982 period for males and by 9.5 weeks a year on average for females, the ONS said.
There are half a million people aged 90 or over in the UK.
The size of this age group has increased over time, and seven out of 10 of them are women.
Responding to the figures, minister for pensions Richard Harrington said: "It is fantastic news that more people are living longer lives.
"I want everyone to be able to enjoy their retirement, but as people live longer it's even more important that they have a pension to help provide financial security in later life."
He added that saving into a workplace pension was one of the best ways for this to be achieved.
