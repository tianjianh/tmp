The 40-year-old Scot, Britain's most successful Olympian, will compete in the second tier at the prestigious 24-hour event.
Hoy and two team-mates will drive a Nissan-powered Ligier JS P2 chassis at Le Mans' Circuit de la Sarthe.
"I'm not thinking beyond Le Mans," said Hoy. "I'm just thinking about getting to the start of the race."
Following his retirement from cycling, Hoy raced in the British GT Championship in 2014 and took part in the European Le Mans Series last year, with his team winning the title.
His co-drivers in France will be Frenchman Andrea Pizzitola and Briton Michael Munemann.
The 11-time world track cycling champion with seven Olympic medals explained: "I wouldn't necessary say 'hi, I'm Chris, I'm a racing driver'.
"But on my Twitter profile I now have 'race cars' at the end of the little list of things. I changed that in the last week.
"I don't now feel like I'm a fish out of water, 'what on earth am I doing here?'
"I didn't do this to replace my cycling, but in many ways I get to carry on some of the really enjoyable parts of my cycling career into motorsport.
"It's exactly the same feeling you have when you're about to race, doesn't matter whether it's on a bike, in a car or even when I was younger, racing BMXs.
"There's still that excitement, the nervousness, the adrenaline.
"I never thought I'd feel that again once I retired from cycling. I thought that was the end of that part of my life."
