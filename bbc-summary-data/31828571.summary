Papers discuss anti-terrorism efforts after the Xinjiang Communist Party chief said some residents had joined the Islamic State militant group.

"We recently broke up a terrorist cell run by those who returned from fighting with the group," the China Daily quotes Zhang Chunxian as saying.
The daily says Mr Zhang's statement marks the first official confirmation that some people in the region had joined IS.
But Shohrat Zakir, chairman of the Xinjiang regional government, stressed that the overall situation in Xinjiang - which has seen several violent attacks or incidents in recent months - was "stable and controllable".
"A number of violent terrorist attacks had been thwarted while they were still in embryonic stages," Xinhua News Agency quotes him as saying.
A Global Times editorial praises law enforcers in Xinjiang for their efforts.
"Police officers' rate of mortality in the line of duty is 5.4 times higher in Xinjiang than the rest of the countryâ€¦ Xinjiang's confrontation with terrorism deserves the gratitude of the whole country," says the paper.
Meanwhile, papers support the decision to fine consumer goods giant Procter & Gamble for "false advertising".
Regulators said P&G overstated the effects of its Crest toothpaste in a TV ad featuring a popular Taiwanese talk show host.
The Beijing News agrees that harsh punishment is a way to stop firms providing "misleading" information to consumers.
"It is not enough for the regulators to hand out a record-high fine to put an end to these untruthful advertisements. Consumers hurt by such information can also seek damages through lawsuits," suggests the article.
An article in the Beijing Times adds that celebrities who appear in such advertisements should be punished too.
A commentary in the Beijing Youth Daily, however, points to the problems in the current law and calls for a review of the regulations.
The current regulation states that advertisers who mislead can be fined up to five times what they spend on the advert, the article notes.
"We can only say that P&G's advertising fee was very high and that led to a higher fine," says the article, worrying that the law is not likely to deter firms with a much lower advertising budget.
And finally, papers discuss the official retirement age for workers as authorities debate policy changes.
Yin Weimin, the minister of human resources and social security, said on Tuesday that the state was expected to implement a new retirement policy "as early as 2022", according to the Global Times.
Government departments are working on the draft law this year and will seek public feedback next year before publishing it in 2017, the report says.
The current policy states that the retirement age for men is 60, while women retire at 50 or 55.
Peng Xizhe, dean of the School of Social Development and Public Policy at Fudan University, suggests having a uniform retirement age for both genders and "then progressively raise the age in some professions".
Observing that many people are unhappy with the plan, the Beijing Youth Daily urges authorities to improve the pension system and make it more attractive for people to retire at a later age.
