The exhibition features pictures of the city posted on photo-sharing site Instagram and is the first display of its kind at the Ikon Gallery.
Themes include architectural heritage, hidden spaces, urban street art, evolving landscape, art and culture.
The More Birmingham Instagram Showcase runs until Sunday.
The exhibition celebrates a successful series of 'Instameet' social media events that have taken place throughout 2015.
The events captured key milestones, from the opening of the revamped New Street Station to the redevelopment of Paradise Circus, key cultural celebrations such as the Big Hoot and the Birmingham Weekender.
The thousands of images produced have generated more than one million hits across social media throughout the year.
Emma Gray, director of marketing and communications at Visit Birmingham, said: "Birmingham's Instameet events have created an online photographic legacy, with thousands of remarkable images generated and shared amongst potential visitors across the world."
The exhibition comprises a mixture of print and projected photography, complimented by a virtual gallery accessible online.
