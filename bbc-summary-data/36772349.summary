At about 21:30 on Monday several residents in Langlands Road reported hearing gunshots.
Officers found nothing at the scene but later two men, aged 22 and 23, attended Queen Elizabeth University Hospital.
Their injuries are not life-threatening. The incident is being treated as attempted murder.
Langlands Road remains closed while investigations are carried out and officers have appealed for information.
Det Insp Tom McKean from Govan CID said: "We believe this was a targeted attack and the two injured men were the intended victims.
"There have been some reports of a red coloured car in the area around the time of the incident and I would like to speak to anyone who may have seen this vehicle as it may be significant to our investigation."
He added: "This incident will undoubtedly be of concern to members of the public and I would like to reassure local residents that we are doing everything we can to find whoever did this as soon as possible. We will also have additional patrols in the area to provide reassurance and they will be happy to speak to anyone who has concerns."
