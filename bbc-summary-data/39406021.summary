First prize winners of the BP Portrait Award are invited to create a portrait of a public figure who has made an important contribution to British history and culture.
The National Portrait Gallery said it was a "rare opportunity" to see all the commissions in one place.
Professor Glenn Burgess, acting vice-chancellor of the University of Hull, said: "Not only does the exhibition depict a wonderful range of famous faces, from actors to athletes and beyond, but the artists responsible have used an amazing variety of styles and compositions in creating these beautiful works."
The free exhibition runs at the Brynmor Jones Library until June.
