[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Elias Kachunga and Kasey Palmer both scored on their Championship debut as Huddersfield narrowly beat Brentford.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
German Under-21 international Kachunga, who is on loan from Bundesliga side Ingolstadt, headed past Daniel Bentley five minutes after the break.
The Bees pulled level through Nico Yennaris after he slipped the ball through loan keeper Danny Ward's legs.
However, Palmer netted with his second touch two minutes later after Bentley had saved well from Rajiv van La Parra.
After enjoying the lion's share of the ball in a goalless first half, the Terriers finally made the most of their most of their dominance when 24-year-old striker Kachunga nodded in at the far post from Tommy Smith's cross, leaving Bentley stranded.
Going a goal behind spurred Brentford into life, as Lewis Macleod's shot went just wide from 25-yards following Sam Saunders' free-kick.
Moments later, Macleod caught the Huddersfield defence napping, as his neat flick was collected by Yennaris for a simple tap-in.
However, 19-year-old Chelsea loanee Palmer - who came off the bench following the visitors' equaliser - brought the ball down brilliantly before scoring to ensure the hosts' first opening-day win since 2010.
Huddersfield manager David Wagner: "It was an outstanding performance and we had many opportunities in the first five or six minutes. In the second half we came into the game more and scored a great goal.
"Then we struggled for 10 or 15 minutes and defended too deep but then Kasey did a great job when he came on.
"What made me really proud was the togetherness we showed. The starting XI must know what the game plan is and those on the bench have to make an impact. Our substitutes were outstanding."
Brentford manager Dean Smith: "The game was a tactical stalemate until the first goal and that changed the game. I was disappointed with the first goal but overall the lads showed a lot of spirit.
"We brought on two subs - Yennaris and Sam Saunders - and we looked more lively. Nico gave us great energy when he came on and scored the goal. He had an infected toe and needed an injection so he could get on the field.
"At the moment we need wide players and that is what we are looking for."
