A large mystery hole which spurted "big plumes of water" and sent plants and snails shooting into the air has appeared on a beach.

The coastguard at Exmouth beach cordoned off the 15ft (4.6m) by 15ft hole on Thursday afternoon.
The hole, which was "bubbling" with water, has since been filled in by the incoming tide.
East Devon District Council said it was trying to find out what caused the hole and a cordon remains at Orcombe Point.
When the coastguard team arrived they said the surrounding sand was soft and fresh holes were appearing.
Kite surf instructor James Dart said: "I looked over and there were big plumes of water coming out of the beach it was all bubbling up much like a geyser, it was probably going about a foot above the beach - it was quite tremendous sight.
"I got closer and saw plant matter coming up a few snails coming out too. It was something to spice things up in the rain."
It is thought there could have been a chamber underneath the hole, about 10ft (3m) to 15ft (4.6m) deep.
Council officials said engineers would "continue to monitor the situation over the weekend and between tides".
They added: "The beach is very popular with dog walkers and bathers who are being advised to avoid the cordoned off area.
"Heavy rain yesterday may be the cause of the hole - a natural phenomenon - to have opened up, but is still a bit of a mystery."
