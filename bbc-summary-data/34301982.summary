[SN]TITLE[SN]
Wrong-way M60 drivers to be prosecuted

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Dozens of motorists are to be prosecuted after being caught driving the wrong way down a slip road of the M60 near Sale, Greater Manchester.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A total of 74 vehicles reversed and drove the wrong way to avoid queuing following a crash which closed the motorway on 6 September.
Police have issued a warning and said the drivers' actions were "irresponsible and dangerous".
The cars blocked emergency vehicles trying to attend the scene.
A police car and an ambulance could not access the motorway via junction six.
The incident was filmed on a mobile phone and the registration plates have been recorded.
PC Matt Picton said: "There is no good reason to drive the wrong way down a motorway, it is extremely dangerous and no excuse could ever justify these actions.
"The laws of the road are there for a reason, which is to protect motorists and people need to realise that they cannot do what they want, when they want."
The introduction of motorways without hard shoulders for emergency vehicles to use meant people needed to pay attention to gantry information, he added.
Those caught will be offered a driver awareness course or summoned to court.
