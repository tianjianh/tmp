Scotland will not fear Poland striker Robert Lewandowski in Thursday's crucial Euro 2016 qualifier, says assistant manager Mark McGhee.

The Scots will be out if they lose but McGhee says they have no special plans to deal with Bayern Munich forward Lewandowski, who has scored 12 goals in his last four games.
"We have total respect for him, a fantastic player," said McGhee.
"But we have players in form as well, players who scored at the weekend."
Scotland could even go out with a win at Hampden, if the Republic of Ireland beat Germany in Dublin but then do not beat Poland in Warsaw on Sunday.
McGhee refutes claims Adam Nawalka's side, who are second in Group D, have improved since the 2-2 draw in Warsaw last year.
"I don't know that as a team they have improved," McGhee said.
"Lewandowski's in form and scoring goals and has proven to be a fantastic acquisition for Bayern Munich, but in general I don't think they're that different from a year ago than we are.
"I don't think they have left us behind in any way."
Scotland's own strikers were in scoring form at the weekend, with Leigh Griffiths, Steven Fletcher, Chris Martin and Jordan Rhodes all finding the net for their clubs.
"We feel we have to match them in every area," said McGhee. "Lewandowski is the guy they hope will get goals for them so we have to pay him attention.
"I watched the games and saw Martin, Fletcher, Griffiths scoring goals and that's encouraging because we know that's going to bring them here full of confidence.
"Poland are dangerous, they will feel they can score, but I don't think we intend to do anything different than we've done until now. We'll still be very difficult to beat.
"If they're going to do better than us they're going to have to do well."
Aberdeen defender Graeme Shinnie could win his first Scotland cap after being called up for the first time.
Shinnie has also played in midfield for the Scottish Premiership leaders this season, and can play in either full-back position.
"It's been good to be in amongst the squad. It's a proud moment in my career," said Shinnie.
"I would just love to be on the pitch. I don't mind wherever I play, I've done it at Aberdeen and there's no reason why I can't do it down here.
"Poland have got good players but we've got great players ourselves. Most of our strikers this weekend have all scored. We know we've got players that can hurt them."
