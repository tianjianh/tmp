Boycott of Q&A TV show sparks heated free-speech debate

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
In 2010, producers of the popular Q&A current affairs TV show signified the failure of a minister to turn up for a live prime-time broadcast with an empty chair.

The prime minister at the time, Julia Gillard, had suggested a backbencher appear in the minister's place.
But the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) rejected her proposal, saying such interference would be a clear breach of the public broadcaster's editorial independence.
Out went the minister; in went the chair.
Now, Prime Minister Tony Abbott has ordered his entire frontbench to avoid the same programme - sparking a fierce debate about freedom of speech and national security.
Angry the show's producers in June allowed a former terror suspect and convicted criminal to ask a question from the studio audience, Mr Abbott has questioned the ABC's allegiance to Australia and demanded that "heads should roll" over the whole affair.
The audience member, Zaky Mallah, had questioned a member of the government about tough new citizenship laws being proposed, and accused the government of encouraging Australian Muslims to "to leave and go to Syria and join [Islamic State]".
The government's communications department ordered a review of the programme and security protocols for its live broadcasts.
There has been a heated debate in Australian political and media circles.
Some say it was foolish and dangerous to allow Mallah - who in the past had threatened to kill government officials - to be in the audience and to ask a question on live TV.
How the government reacted:
•      Mr Abbott said the ABC gave "a platform to a convicted criminal and terrorist sympathiser"
•      The PM has ordered his ministers not to appear on Q&A
•      Several government ministers have pulled out of scheduled Q&A appearances
•      The Department of Communications has reviewed Q&A editorial procedures
Others say Australians must be free to debate and question government policy.
Media experts say Mr Abbott's boycott is a dangerous step into the realm of press censorship.
Editorially independent of the government, the ABC is, however, a publicly funded broadcaster.
Over the years, its budget has been cut by various governments, most recently to the tune of A$254m ($187m, £120m) over five years by what has been dubbed Mr Abbott's razor gang.
The prime minister's stance on Q&A is the "most dramatic" media boycott by a politician that Queensland University of Technology journalism professor Brian McNair can recall.
Prof McNair believes the government considers the ABC "unpatriotic" on sensitive topics such as the government's strong anti-terrorism rhetoric and treatment of asylum seekers in off-shore detention centres.
"There is pressure from the government that the ABC is not towing the line when it comes to big issues like boat control [and] how you manage extreme Islam," he told the BBC.
"This [case] is ammunition that they might use in future to say we're going to change your funding regime [or] require you to do this or that."
ABC's director of corporate affairs and a former senior editor at Fairfax Media, Michael Millett, agrees.
"Why is the prime minister so pre-occupied with one television programme? It is directly seen as an attempt by him to interfere with the ABC's independence," Mr Millet told the BBC.
The boycott is not without precedent.
For example, for most of his seven years in government in the 1990s, Victorian state Premier Jeff Kennett ordered his ministers not to appear on ABC's 7.30 programme.
Other media boycotts
Under Prime Minister Julia Gillard, Labor ministers did not appear on talkback radio host Alan Jones' show for six months in 2012 after Mr Jones said Ms Gillard's father had "died of shame" because of his daughter.
Unofficial boycotts by politicians of programmes or blacklisting of journalists are common. In most cases, politicians simply say they are unavailable.
Advertising the decision in the way Mr Abbott has done is more unusual, say media watchers.
In opposition, Mr Abbott was a regular guest on Q&A but as prime minister he has avoided the unscripted and largely spontaneous show.
He has also shunned the ABC's LateLine and 7.30 programmes, both known for hard-hitting political interviews.
Back in 2012, Mr Abbott insisted he would not boycott Alan Jones' controversial show, despite describing the talkback host's comments about Ms Gillard as "unacceptable".
Mr Abbott said then it would be foolish to "ignore an audience of half a million people in Sydney".
Could Mr Abbott's Q&A boycott backfire?
Government ministers are usually keen to promote their policies and advertise their profiles; in their absence, opposition ministers are filling their vacant chairs.
Q&A's ratings have also risen strongly since the Mallah episode.
Journalist and author Margaret Simons believes Mr Abbott runs a risk of isolating the public.
She says most voters probably consider "this a spat between the political class and of not much relevance to them".
Mr Millett says the dialogue will eventually resume.
"There have always been tensions between politicians and certain media personalities and programmes and you often get stand-offs," he says.
"Sooner or later there has to be engagement and there always is," he says.
"In the end, you can't ignore the press."
