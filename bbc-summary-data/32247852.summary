[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Manchester Airport has broken its all-time yearly passenger record, with more than 22.32m people flying from the site over the last 12 months.

The airport said it represented a growth of 7.5% year-on-year.
The rise in passengers is connected to increasing capacity and frequency on existing routes, as well as new long haul services starting.
Ken O'Toole, the airport's managing director, called it a "magnificent achievement".
He said: "It's a historic milestone for Manchester Airport and UK aviation, as well as a huge boost for the economy and the north of England."
The figure beats the previous 12-month record set in July 2006 of 22.26m.
