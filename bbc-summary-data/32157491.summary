Tilly was found to have suffered a single stab wound to the stomach in a field off Broadcar Road in Hoyland near Barnsley on Sunday.
The RSPCA and a vet were called after the grey mare was found by a dog walker just before 07:00 BST.
Owner Michelle Steeples said she had been left "devastated" by the attack on Tilly who was ready to be rehomed.
The RSPCA and South Yorkshire Police has launched a joint investigation.
"It was like something out of a horror film," Ms Steeples said.
Tilly was being cared and trained for by Ms Steeples after getting a reputation for being "difficult".
"She was making great progress. She was just about ready to get rehomed," Ms Steeples said.
Ms Steeples has set up a Justice for Tilly Facebook group and the reward has been offered by a stranger who heard what had happened.
"The vet confirmed it was a deliberate wound," she said. "It was one single stab wound to the underside of her stomach.
"The wound was about two or three hours old."
RSPCA inspector John Lawson said: "The poor horse, a very sweet small grey mare, was suffering greatly and was put to sleep on humane grounds."
