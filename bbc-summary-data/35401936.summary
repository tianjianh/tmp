[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Museum-goers in Cardiff will be charged for the first time in 13 years to see an exhibition, which features props from Indiana Jones films.

The jacket, hat and whip of the big-screen adventurer are on display at the National Museum.
Visitors have not been charged since 2003, but the museum's director general David Anderson defended the move.
He said it was the only way they were able to afford to ship the famous items to the city from around the world.
"We are charging because that has enabled us to afford to bring material from all over the world into the show, and it means the people of Wales can see things like the Indiana Jones hat, whip, jacket and skull that have come from the States by special arrangement with the George Lucas museum for us to be able to show it here," he said.
"It just wouldn't be here otherwise."
Visitors will have to stump up Â£7 for the exhibition, but Mr Anderson promised a "blockbuster".
The museum received Welsh government funds to convert a special space for the exhibition, but overall annual funding has fallen and will be cut by a further Â£1m (4.7%) from April.
Deputy culture minister Ken Skates said he supported charging for the exhibition, which runs until 30 October, but stood by the principle of free entry at the front door.
"Income generated from this exhibition will be used to support future exhibitions and continue to develop the museum for the benefit of its users," he added.
Entry for children and some community groups will be free.
