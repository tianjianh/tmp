The 17-year-old is expected to appear at Falkirk Sheriff Court later in connection with the incident.
The school was evacuated after the flare was discharged shortly before the start of the school day on 28 April.
Fire crews were called to the secondary school following the incident, but no damage was caused by the flare and no-one was injured.
A Police Scotland spokesman said: "Whilst some may consider this type of behaviour as a prank, we must remember that thick smoke and burning flares can cause panic or injury.
"In addition, considerable disruption was caused within the school environment and the fire service had to attend."
