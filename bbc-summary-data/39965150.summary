[SN]TITLE[SN]
Labour leader to speak at Durham Miner's Gala for second year

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn is to speak at the Durham Miner's Gala for the second year running, with organisers hoping he will do so as prime minister.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
In 2016 rebel Labour MPs who called for Mr Corbyn to quit were denied access to the platform of the traditional gathering known as the "Big Meeting".
The gala, which is in its 133rd year, is one of the largest trade union gatherings in Europe.
Mr Corbyn's speech last year was the first by a Labour leader since 2012.
The event features banners, brass bands marching through Durham City, speeches and a huge funfair.
Alan Cummings, secretary of the Durham Miners' Association, said: "Jeremy has spoken at the gala on numerous occasions over the years as a backbench MP, a Labour leadership candidate and as Labour leader.
"This summer we hope he will address the gala as Labour prime minister.
"Jeremy has described the Big Meeting as the greatest demonstration of working class culture in Britain, and we are very pleased that once again he has accepted our invitation to speak."
The gala takes place on 8 July.
