Mohed Altrad: Gloucester hold 'discussions' with Montpellier owner

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Gloucester have had "discussions" with France-based billionaire Mohed Altrad over a potential purchase of shares, the Premiership club have confirmed.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 68-year-old owner of French Top 14 side Montpellier wants to take over the Cherry and Whites, reports L'Equipe.
Martin St Quinton has been the sole owner of Gloucester since February.
"Any potential investment in Gloucester would be seen as an important opportunity to develop the club," a club statement said.
"Any agreement would need to have the consent of the relevant regulatory bodies and currently there is no agreement entered into or guarantee of an investment.
"In the event of any investment, both Gloucester and Montpellier will remain separate entities, independent and autonomous from each other."
Montpellier are second in the French top flight, while Gloucester are eighth in the Premiership with three wins from 10 league games.

The big thing is getting approval from the game's governing bodies to any proposed dual ownership by Mohed Altrad.
I understand there are five governing bodies who would have to approve the investment. Whether they would intend to veto any such plans remains to be seen.
