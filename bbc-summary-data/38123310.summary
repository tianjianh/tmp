England head coach Eddie Jones has called for a change in the way foul play is refereed in rugby union.

Wing Elliot Daly was sent off in the 27-14 win against Argentina on Saturday for a tackle on number eight Leonardo Senatore who landed on his neck.
Argentine wing Juan-Pablo Estelles escaped sanction for a similar offence on Jonny May because the England and Gloucester man landed on his side.
"I argue against [it being judged on] the outcome," Jones said.
He added on BBC Radio 5 live: "I think it should be based on the action."
Daly became just the fifth England player in history to be sent off in a Test match.
Jones continued: "Elliot was reckless, there is no doubt about that, and deserved a red card. But Jonny May gets knocked over and he gets straight back on his feet, and it's a penalty.
"That's something to look at in the future. All we want is consistency."
England won their 13th match in a row by beating Argentina on Saturday despite the red card after less than five minutes at Twickenham.
A penalty try and three Owen Farrell penalties opened up a 16-0 lead. Tries from Facundo Isa and Santiago Cordero cut the gap to two points but a  Jonny May score pulled England clear.
Meanwhile, England captain Dylan Hartley says he could empathise with Daly after his red card.
Hartley told BBC Radio 5 live: "I've been in a similar situation. You can't dwell on it, it's done. You have got to move on, adapt, and look at how you can regain a foothold in the game."
Hartley feels going a man down for almost the whole match provided the side with the perfect challenge.
The hooker added: "My overall gut feeling is that it was a really hearty performance, I'm really proud of the guys, the way they dug in.
"[The red card] galvanised us, and we were able to put some good points on the board against a good team."
