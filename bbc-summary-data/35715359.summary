Irish election: 158 seats in Dáil filled as Longford-Westmeath count ends

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
All 158 seats in the new Dáil (parliament) have now been filled after the final recount in the Irish general election ended on Thursday morning.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The election of Labour's Willie Penrose in Longford-Westmeath meant his party has secured speaking rights in the Dáil.
Fine Gael's Peter Burke was also elected to the constituency on Thursday.
No party won enough seats in Friday's general election to govern alone.
Fine Gael remains the largest party with 50 seats, six ahead of Fianna Fáil.
Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael have dominated Irish politics since the early 1930s but they have never been in a formal coalition.
At present, any new government needs the support of nearly 80 elected members (called Teachtaí Dála or TDs).
Taoiseach (prime minister) Enda Kenny has said he will talk to all parties, including Fianna Fáil, in a bid to form a new government.
The parliamentary parties of both Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil will meet on Thursday  to discuss the formation of a government and their positions on negotiations.
The other seats in the Dáil were taken by: Sinn Fein, 23; Labour seven and independents and smaller parties, 34.
