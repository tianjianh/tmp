Reading held on with 10 men as they beat fellow Championship side Brighton in the EFL Cup third round.

Stephen Quinn's close-range finish from a corner gave them a first-half lead but defender Tyler Blackett was sent off before half-time for a late tackle.
Jaap Stam's side pressed on after the interval and John Swift doubled their lead with a right-foot strike.
The Royals then survived a nervy finish after Tomer Hemed pulled a goal back for Brighton with five minutes left.
Blackett's dismissal made him the second Reading player in the space of four days to be shown a red card following Garath McCleary's sending off against Barnsley in the league on Saturday.
The former Manchester United player tangled with midfielder Sebastien Pocognoli, who was making his Brighton debut, and referee Lee Probert had no hesitation in showing him a straight red card.
Albion's former Reading loanee Glenn Murray struck the crossbar moments after Blackett's departure, but the hosts were up against it once Swift netted his second goal in as many games.
Murray did lay on Hemed's consolation, but Brighton were unable to add to the striker's effort.
Brighton boss Chris Hughton:
"We conceded two poor goals against a side that started better than us. We found it difficult to get close.
"We weren't able to take our chances. In that period it wasn't the lack of trying, but we didn't get enough bodies in the box."
Reading assistant manager Andries Ulderink:
"We started very well when it was 11 against 11 - it was a little bit like Saturday. We dominated the game and created a couple of great chances.
"I must be honest, Brighton had a couple of good chances too, but overall we were very happy with the 11 v 11 situation and we deserved our first goal.
"You hoped we would get the second goal in the first half. But then the sending off and the game changes... again.
"We worked very hard. And it was hard work, defending more than playing the football we like to play."
