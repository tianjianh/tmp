He told police that he was a lawyer and was just clearing out his shed before telling police to "get out of my garden if you don't have a warrant".
In a Facebook post, PSNI Banbridge said: "That would be well and good, if he was a lawyer or if it was his house or if it wasn't 05:30am or if we needed a warrant".
The man was arrested by officers from E section for questioning about burglary and attempted burglary.
"A big shout out to the alert neighbours who phoned us to make us aware," the Facebook posted added, "It doesn't come much easier than that! Keep the calls coming, and we'll keep slapping the cuffs on".
The work of officers did not go unnoticed by Assistant Chief Constable Stephen Martin who tweeted: "Excellent work @PSNI Banbridge!"
