Leigh Halfpenny: New Toulon contract close says owner Mourad Boudjellal

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Toulon want to renew Wales full-back Leigh Halfpenny's contract before he goes on tour with the British and Irish Lions next week, says the French club.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Halfpenny, 28, joined Toulon in 2014 from Cardiff Blues and his current deal runs out this summer.
The Top 14 side's owner, Mourad Boudjellal, wants to have the contract sorted "by the end of this week".
Toulon have made an offer reported to be worth Â£750,000 per year for the club's top points-scorer.
His former Welsh region, in conjunction with the Welsh Rugby Union had offered Halfpenny a national dual contract (NDC), but Blues chief executive Richard Holland admitted in March that it was "unlikely" the player would agree a return.
Halfpenny again proved his worth as Toulon reached the French Top 14 semi-finals, scoring a crucial late try in a personal haul of 21 points as they saw off Castres 26-22 last Friday.
Toulon will face La Rochelle in Marseille on Friday, 26 May for a place in the final, which will be Halfpenny's last game of the season for the club.
The Top 14 final is not until 4 June and Lions coach Warren Gatland has confirmed that Halfpenny will join up with the Lions squad immediately after the semi-final for the tour to New Zealand.
