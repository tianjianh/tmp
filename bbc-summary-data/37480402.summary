Torquay United 1-0 Dagenham & Redbridge

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Ten-man Dagenham & Redbridge were knocked off top spot in the National League after losing to Torquay at Plainmoor.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Daggers were faced with an uphill struggle from the 15th minute when captain Scott Doe was sent off after bringing Danny Sparkes down as the Gulls frontman was bearing down on goal.
Eight minutes later Jamie Reid smashed home the only goal from Nathan Blissett's cut back from close range following some excellent work from the striker to get to the byline.
Dagenham pushed for an equaliser despite being a man down, and almost got it through substitute Christian Assombalonga but he headed wide, meaning the visitors suffered a first loss in five games.
