[SN]TITLE[SN]
Green Patrick Harvie to stand for Glasgow Kelvin seat

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Patrick Harvie, the co-convener of the Scottish Greens, has announced he will stand in a first-past-the-post seat at next year's Holyrood election.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Mr Harvie will contest the Glasgow Kelvin constituency in next May's poll.
He has been a Green MSP for the Glasgow region since 2003, elected under the proportional "list" system.
Mr Harvie will remain top of his party's list for the election, but said the "time is right" for him to contest the constituency seat.
The voting system for Holyrood means MSPs for the Scottish Parliament can be elected in one of two ways: under a constituency first-past the post system like that at Westminster, or in a second vote where parties are allocated additional members on a proportional basis.
Mr Harvie was elected under the latter method.
He said he was "delighted" to be standing for the Kelvin constituency, which is currently help by the SNP's Sandra White.
He added: "It's been an honour to represent the city in the Scottish Parliament for the past 12 years and I believe the time is right to contest the constituency vote.
"We have a strong team in Glasgow, with four Green councillors who have made a huge impact in their communities.
"With that track record, we are campaigning to win Kelvin in 2016."
The Greens said polling put them on about 10% on the regional vote for next year's election, suggesting they could get eight to 12 MSPs, with at least one in each of the eight regions.
