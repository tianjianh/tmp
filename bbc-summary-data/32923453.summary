[SN]TITLE[SN]
Eurotunnel to end Dover-Calais MyFerryLink partnership

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Eurotunnel has announced it will end its partnership with cross-Channel ferry service, MyFerryLink.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The competition authority announced it was looking to take the legal wrangle over the company's ferry service to the Supreme Court saying it should be treated as a merger.
Eurotunnel bought the three ships from SeaFrance when it went bust in 2012 and leased them to MyFerryLink.
The lease will not be renewed when it expires on 2 July, Eurotunnel said.
The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has argued that Eurotunnel has more than half the market share of Channel crossings with its rail services and MyFerryLink service between Dover and Calais.
The CMA said it was looking to take the case to the Supreme Court after the Court of Appeal had ruled the authority did not have jurisdiction over the purchase of the three ferries.
In January, Eurotunnel was told it must cease its MyFerryLink cross Channel service following a ruling by the Competition Appeal Tribunal.
Court of Appeal judges overturned the decision earlier this month with a two-to-one majority verdict.
