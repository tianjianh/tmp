It happened at about 20:40, during a performance by the Nitro Circus, which is touring Europe.
The Scottish Ambulance Service said it took one male patient to Glasgow Royal Infirmary. Another casualty was taken to the same hospital by private ambulance.
They are thought to have been volunteers from the audience.
The stunt involved a bike rider and three members of the public.
The bike failed to clear a ramp and all four fell off. All were wearing protective suits and helmets.
One man is believed to have suffered a hip injury and the other one facial injuries.
