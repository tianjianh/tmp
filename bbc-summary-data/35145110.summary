[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Christopher Meli, 20, died after he was attacked by a gang of youths on a pathway by Glasvey Close in the Twinbrook estate on 12 December.
His funeral will take place on Monday. Three teenagers appeared in court last week charged with murder.
Detectives handed out leaflets appealing for information and spoke to people in the area on Sunday.
Det Ch Insp Richard Campbell, who is leading the investigation, said: "Whilst a number of persons have presented themselves to police, and have been interviewed, about their involvement in the murder of Christopher Meli, there are others who have not yet taken this course of action and I would urge you to make contact with police."
Hundreds of people attended a vigil last Monday for the father of one, who police said was the victim of a "sustained and vicious assault".
