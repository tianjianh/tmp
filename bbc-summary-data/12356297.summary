The musician-turned farmer will host the Harvest event, featuring acts such as KT Tunstall, at his farm at Kingham, Chipping Norton from 9 to 12 September.
It will be a sister event to the one being held by TV presenter Jimmy Doherty at his farm near Ipswich in Suffolk over the same weekend.
Mr James said it will be a "celebration of food, the farm and music".
The bassist, who has developed a cheese-making business since stepping away from the limelight, as well as working as a broadcaster, said: "We'll throw open the farm gates for Harvest this September.
"My family are looking forward to a celebration of all our favourite things - food, the farm and music."
Notable food experts at the event will include Richard Corrigan, Mark Hix and Yotam Ottolenghi as well as Gardeners' World host Monty Don.
The festival will include cookery master classes, pop-up restaurants, gardening workshops, a farmers market and a children's field at the farm at Kingham, Chipping Norton.
Blur reformed for shows in 2009 with the bassist expected to record with them again this year.
