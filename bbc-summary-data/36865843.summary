[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An unemployed man has admitted raping an elderly woman after barging into her south London home.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The woman, in her 70s, was making breakfast when Jason Batchelor of Maldon Road, Wallington, attacked her in her house in Purley on 11 May.
The 46-year-old told police he had "messed up" when he was arrested.
He was convicted at Croydon Crown Court of rape, attempted rape, sexual assault, actual bodily harm and intent to commit a sexual offence.
Police said Batchelor charged his way into the house after the woman slightly opened the front door when he knocked on it.
He punched her in the face, causing extensive bruising, then raped her and took cash before leaving the property.
Batchelor was arrested three days later after forensic examinations found DNA that matched his.
He told officers he was "sorry" and had "never done anything like this before" when he was held.
Det Insp Keith Ward said the "courage and bravery" the woman had shown during the "horrific ordeal" was "humbling".
"Batchelor is a dangerous offender who committed offences against the woman in her own home, a place where she has every right to feel safe and secure," he said.
The 46-year-old will be sentenced on 19 August.
