Police said Kayla, an American bald-eagle, was targeted after violence broke out at a Palace home game against Charlton Athletic in September.
A 34-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of violent disorder and attempted criminal damage.
Six other men were also arrested on Wednesday in connection with the violence, Scotland Yard said.
Kayla has been Crystal Palace's mascot since 2010 and flies around the stadium at every home game.
The 19-year-old female is based at Eagle Heights sanctuary in Eynsford, Kent.
She is from Canada but was brought to the UK after she became too aggressive to remain at her previous home, according to her owners.
Kayla also appeared on the front cover of US rockers King's Of Leon's album, Only By The Night.
She has continued to perform her match day duties since the Capital One Cup game against Charlton.
The side, known as The Eagles, won the match at Selhurst Park 4-1.
