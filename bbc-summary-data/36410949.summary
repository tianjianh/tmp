Mr Duterte won a landslide victory in the presidential election this month, taking about six million votes more than his closest competitor.
The tough-talking mayor of Davao won on a strident anti-crime platform, promising to wipe out crime in months.
Mr Duterte, 71, did not attend Monday's ceremony, saying he had "never attended any proclamation all my life".
He has largely stayed in Davao, in the south, since his election win.
The joint session of the House of Representatives and the Senate also proclaimed Maria Leonor "Leni" Robredo as vice-president.
Both will be sworn in on 30 June, and serve a single six-year term before the constitution requires they stand down.
