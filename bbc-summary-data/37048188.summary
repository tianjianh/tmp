What did the lucky Leicester City punters do next?

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A handful of people won considerable sums of cash by betting on Leicester City to win the Premier League last season at odds of 5,000-1. What did they spend their winnings on - and where will they be placing their cash this year?

One man whose belief in his team paid off was Leicester fan and father-of-two Keval Nakeshree, from Gloucester.
He put a modest fiver on the Foxes being top at Christmas and another £5 each-way they'd win the league. It was an act of faith that netted him £33,000.
What has he spent his winnings on?
"A family holiday to Disney World in Florida, holidays around the UK and paying off a couple of credit cards," he said.
"I did it purely for fun," he adds. "The last few fixtures were very tough for Leicester, but for me, they were the form team at that point and they carried on, I wasn't worried about cashing out."
Mr Nakeshree is undecided who to back this season, but believes the Foxes finishing in the top four could be worth a punt.
Meanwhile, lifelong Leicester fan John Pryke was tempted into making his very first bet by the 5,000-1 odds offered by Ladbrokes.
In the end he cashed out his £20 bet as the thought of a £100,000 windfall was too much to contend with.
He settled for the tidy sum of £29,000 and has spent it on his home in Leicester Forest East. He's installed a new kitchen, flooring, garden and even a small swimming pool.
He also says he is just about to do up his bathroom.
Mr Pryke, who also put £10 on the Foxes to finish in the top three, at 400-1, says he felt he had to cash in his bet because the knowledge of his wager started to take away his enjoyment of the games.
"I had to stop. It was on my shoulders the whole time," he said.
"Maybe the only slight regret is I would have been able to help my son as he has now decided he wants to go to university - but there was big relief when I cashed out."
Ever the optimist, Mr Pryke has backed Leicester to win the Champions League, but said that will be his final punt.
