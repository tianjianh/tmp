Croft is currently in South Africa as part of England's backroom team for their one-day series in South Africa.
The England spin bowling consultant was previously Glamorgan bowling coach and has signed a rolling contract to replace Toby Radford.
"I've learned a heck of a lot in the England environment. I want to take Glamorgan forward," Croft told the BBC.
The former Glamorgan captain has won a County Championship and three Sunday League titles in his 28 years with Glamorgan.
Croft believes his experience with the current England set-up has proved invaluable.
"I feel privileged when I am invited into the England environment," he said.
"To listen to Trevor Bayliss, Paul Farbrace and Otis Gibson -it fills your notebook and you learn things, definitely.
"It reaffirms some of your own ideas too."
Croft believes he can improve Glamorgan, who finished fourth in County Championship Division Two last season, but is looking to the long-term.
"I am very excited, looking forward to it and I'm very honoured. I follow in the footsteps of some very good people," he explained.
"I want to take the county forward, to make the most out of every individual and make the most out of the team.
"We've got plenty of experience and want to integrate some of the younger players as well.
"We want a strong team. Not just for this season, but for a number of seasons."
