Multimillion-pound plans to redevelop a shopping centre known as "the spaceship" have gone on display.

The Agora centre was opened in Wolverton, Milton Keynes, in 1979, but has fallen into disrepair.
Brickhill Estates wants to turn the site into 90 flats and 25,000 sq ft (2,322 sq m) of retail space.
The proposals have been put on the architect's website for public consultation before a formal planning application is submitted.
Neil Hollingworth, director of Brickhill Estates, said: "People refer to the Agora as the spaceship which landed in the centre of Wolverton.
"It's totally out of character with the rest of the town.
"This plan would rejuvenate and bring forward Wolverton as a town, and provide affordable housing for young people."
But Marie Osbourne, director of Future Wolverton, said while the community was "glad to see a plan to get rid of the Agora" there were concerns their hopes for the Agora might not be met.
