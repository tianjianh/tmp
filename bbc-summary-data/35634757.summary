[SN]TITLE[SN]
Thomas Anthony Carlin: Jailed officer refused permission for Supreme Court appeal

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A policeman who was jailed for trying to arrest a senior judge in a Belfast court has been denied leave to appeal his case at the Supreme Court.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Thomas Anthony Carlin, 43, attempted to arrest Lord Justice Gillen last month while representing himself against his bank in a house repossession case.
On Monday, he failed to secure leave to challenge his conviction for contempt.
Lord Chief Justice Sir Declan Morgan ruled he had not established arguable legal grounds to appeal his case.
However, despite the setback, the serving Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) officer can still try a different route to have the case heard in the UK's highest court.
His lawyers confirmed they are now set to make a direct request to the Supreme Court for an urgent hearing.
Carlin had been representing himself in his legal battle with Santander bank over claims that he had failed to make mortgage payments on a property in County Antrim.
After he threatened to arrest the judge hearing his case, Lord Justice Gillen, the policeman was prosecuted for contempt by Northern Ireland's Attorney General John Larkin.
Carlin was found guilty of the offence last week and is currently serving a three-month prison sentence.
At that stage, he was told that if he seeks to apologise after 28 days, the rest of his sentence would be set aside.
However, the case then took a new twist when it emerged that the policeman intended to challenge the conviction.
Carlin had previously turned down offers of help from professional lawyers, but Belfast-based law firm Madden and Finucane have been instructed to represent his interests.
His solicitor confirmed on Monday: "We are going to urgently petition the Supreme Court for permission to appeal Mr Carlin's conviction."
