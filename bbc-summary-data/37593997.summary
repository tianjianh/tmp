[SN]TITLE[SN]
Cheltenham Town 2-1 Crawley Town

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Birthday boy Billy Waters and Jack Munns struck as Cheltenham ended a six-match winless League Two run with a 2-1 win over Crawley.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Waters stroked home after three minutes with Munns doubling the lead just after the hour mark and although Kabi Djalo's 20-yard blast tested the hosts' mettle with 12 minutes to play, the Robins weathered the storm.
Waters latched on to English Football League debutant Kyle Storer's through ball and jinked his way past Joe McNerney before sweeping to Glenn Morris' right with the first attack of the match.
Cheltenham continued to dominate but chances were at a premium with Munns rolling past the far post on 22 minutes.
Crawley improved after the restart with substitute Bobson Bawling forcing a fingertip save from Russell Griffiths, James Collins just failing to connect with Enzio Boldewijn's low centre and Djalo volleying fractionally wide.
But Cheltenham went two up when Waters had his effort headed off the line by Mark Connolly, only for Munns to slam home.
The visitors kept probing and got their reward when Bawling and Boldewijn combined to find Djalo to fire through a host of bodies from 20 yards.
Cheltenham hit the woodwork for a second time when Danny Wright collected a high free kick and nudged against the near upright late on, with the miss setting up a tense finale.
