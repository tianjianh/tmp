[SN]TITLE[SN]
Crawley Town 0-0 Accrington Stanley

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Crawley failed to score at home for the first time this season as Accrington had the better of a 0-0 tussle at the Checkatrade.com Stadium.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Stanley defender Matty Pearson could have settled the issue late on but shot wastefully wide as John Coleman's side failed to take their chances.
Accrington were also denied by the woodwork and found keeper Glenn Morris in good form.
Visting keeper Elliot Parish came to his side's rescue in only the fifth minute by producing a tremendous reaction save to deny James Collins following a cross from Dutchman Enzio Boldewijn.
Sean McConville set up Terry Gornell at the other end but Crawley keeper Glenn Morris kept out his goal-bound effort.
Defender Pearson was twice off target for Accrington after Boldewijn fired over from a good position for the hosts.
Both sides went close shortly before the interval with keeper Parish saving well from Collins before a low drive from Jordan Clark was parried by opposite number Morris.
Crawley skipper Jimmy Smith cleared off the line from Omar Beckles and Accrington winger John O'Sullivan later shot against a post after Patrick Lacey had an effort blocked.
