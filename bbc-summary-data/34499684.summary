About 140 people attended a meeting to voice their concerns over plans to reopen and expand a quarry in Cardiff.

A campaign group has presented a 1,200-strong petition to Cardiff council against a planning application to bring Creigiau quarry back to life.
Firm Tarmac says its plan balances the need to extract 12.75m tonnes of limestone with "mitigating the impacts of developing the quarry".
The meeting took place at 19:00 BST on Sunday at Creigiau Church Hall.
The Stop Creigiau Quarry group claims country roads will become "no-go zones" with lorries taking up access routes, while environmental concerns have also been raised.
Residents are also worried that dust and noise from the quarry will affect children at Pentyrch Primary School, which is just two fields away from the quarry site.
