The longest-serving coach in the Welsh Premiership is leaving his current club after 16 years in charge.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Bedwas head coach Steve Law will be joining Cardiff RFC this summer as their director of rugby.
Law helped Bedwas reach the play-offs this season and has earned a reputation as a spotter of young talent.
"Steve has been a great servant of Bedwas and most people will realise the huge input he has made in our rise," director of rugby Mark Lewis said.
