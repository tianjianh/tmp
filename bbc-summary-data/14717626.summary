Scotland international right-back Hutton, 26, has joined on a permanent deal after signing a four-year contract for an undisclosed fee.
Midfielder Jenas, 28, has arrived on loan until the end of the season after six years at Spurs.
Hutton was given permission to leave the Scotland camp earlier on Wednesday and it is understood he turned down Fulham to join Villa.
He had fallen out of favour at Spurs this season and will be reunited with former Rangers boss Alex McLeish at Villa.
McLeish said: "Alan is a player whom I know well. He fits the bill in terms of having the right temperament to be an important and influential player for Villa.
"Jermaine is a dynamic midfield player and I feel he will add to the quality of the squad as well. He has also played at a very high level and I'm sure he will be relishing this opportunity."
Jenas joined Spurs from Newcastle in 2005 and he has made 201 appearances for the club.
Villa have also agreed to sign Republic of Ireland Under-21 international defender Enda Stevens from Shamrock Rovers for an undisclosed fee in January 2012.
The 21-year-old will play against Tottenham in the group stages of the Europa League before his move to Villa Park.
