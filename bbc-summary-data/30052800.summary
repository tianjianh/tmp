Water restored to Cold Ash homes and schools

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Water supplies have been returned to schools and homes after a burst pipe emptied a reservoir in Berkshire.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Two schools were forced to close on Thursday and up to 700 homes were without water after the pipe burst at Cold Ash.
Thames Water said the reservoir was operating normally on Friday morning.
A spokesman said the water could appear cloudy for several hours because of bubbles in the pipework but the trapped air was harmless.
Between 600 and 700 residents in the postcode areas RG14, RG18 and RG20 were without water.
Bottled water was handed out at several locations.
Cold Ash St Marks Primary and Hermitage Primary School were closed, along with Cold Ash pre-school, which operates from Acland Hall.
Priors Court School was been affected but remained open.
