All Blacks will be like 'wounded animal' for Ireland rematch in Dublin

Former Ireland flanker Stephen Ferris has warned that New Zealand will come into their Test match against the Irish at the Aviva Stadium in Dublin on 19 November "a bit like a wounded animal".

Ireland beat the All Blacks at the 29th attempt in Chicago on Saturday - their 40-29 win bringing to an end the world champions' run of 18 straight triumphs.
"I think the boys will put in another serious shift," said Ferris.
"That's what it's going to take but confidence will be high," he added.
"The whole of Irish rugby was on a high over the weekend but the boys will be aware that the All Blacks can score from anywhere at any stage of the game.
"A lot of new faces will come in for this weekend's match with Canada and hopefully we can get the win and then another one against New Zealand the week after."
The ex-British and Irish Lions back-rower was hugely impressed by the display put in by Ireland at Soldier Field, lauding their 40-point haul against the Kiwis, which saw them move up one place in the IRB rankings to fifth, as "unbelievable".
"The performance the guys put in, the intensity they played with, the accuracy they played with, was phenomenal," he said.
"Rory Best alluded to them doing their homework in knowing what the All Blacks were going to throw at them and they were the better team for 80 minutes.
"It wasn't one of those matches where they got lucky with the odd decision.
"To score 40 points in any Test match is hard work but to score 40 points against the All Blacks is unbelievable. Fair play to the lads, to a man they stood up well."
British and Irish Lions coach Warren Gatland attended Saturday's match in Chicago and Ferris believes that a number of Irish players boosted their hopes of inclusion in the squad to tour New Zealand next summer.
"You see the way Wales were put to the sword by Australia in their own back yard and then Ireland go away from home and put in a ridiculous performance," he said.
"For me, there will be a lot more Irish players on Warren Gatland's radar than there were a couple of weeks ago so hopefully there will be a large contingent on the plane to New Zealand in the summer."
