The 19-year-old central defender, who was recently with Irish club Bohemians, will initially be with the Lions' development squad.
Rooney impressed after previously being invited to train with the south London club, who have not disclosed the length of his contract.
"Paul came in for a few days last year to show us his talent," manager Neil Harris told Millwall's website.
"He's been playing in the League of Ireland as a young man in a men's division, so physically he can compete.
"I'm not putting any pressure on him. He needs to come in, find his feet and enjoy himself. Fingers crossed it works out."
