The victim was found at Laburnum Grove at 13.45 BST on Monday, Lancashire Police said.
Officers believe the deceased is John Houston, 41, from Lancaster, but he has not yet been formally identified.
A 43-year-old man from Lancaster has been arrested on suspicion of murder and is in police custody.
Det Insp Simon Dent said police are "keen to piece together Mr Houston's last movements from Saturday (2 April) onwards".
"If anyone has information that could assist us with our enquiries, particularly those from the Marsh estate who may have seen John in the lead up to his death, I would urge them to come forward and speak to us," he said.
