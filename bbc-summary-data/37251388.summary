[SN]TITLE[SN]
Brazil's former President Dilma Rousseff appeals impeachment

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff has filed an appeal at the Supreme Court against the Senate's decision to dismiss her after an impeachment trial.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
More than two-thirds of the Senate voted on Wednesday to remove Ms Rousseff from office for illegally manipulating the budget two years ago.
Hours after the vote her vice-president, Michel Temer, was sworn in.
Ms Rousseff said the impeachment proceedings amounted to a coup d'etat.
The proceedings against her in the Senate were flawed, said her lawyer, Jose Eduardo Cardozo.
He requested "the immediate suspension of the effects of the Senate decision" and a new vote at the Senate.
But analysts say Ms Rousseff's appeal has very little chance of succeeding.
Mr Temer is in China, where he will take part in a summit of the G20 group of major economies.
He was sworn in two hours after the Senate's vote to dismiss Ms Rousseff, which ended 13 years in power of her left-wing Workers' Party.
Mr Temer will serve out Ms Rousseff's term until 1 January 2019.
The centre-right PMDB party politician had been serving as acting president during the impeachment proceedings.
During his first cabinet meeting since the vote, Mr Temer said his inauguration marked a "new era of hope".
The dismissal of Ms Rousseff has caused a rift between Brazil and three left-wing South American governments that criticised the move later on Wednesday.
Brazil and Venezuela recalled each other's ambassadors. Brazilian envoys to Bolivia and Ecuador have also been ordered home.
Ms Rousseff lost the impeachment battle but won a separate Senate vote that had sought to ban her from public office for eight years.
Pledging to appeal against her dismissal, she told her supporters: "I will not say goodbye to you. I am certain I can say: 'See you soon.'"
Ms Rousseff was suspended in May after the Senate voted to go ahead with the impeachment process.
She was accused of moving funds between government budgets, which is illegal under Brazilian law.
Her critics said she was trying to plug deficit holes in popular social programmes to boost her chances of being re-elected in 2014.
Ms Rousseff fought the allegations, arguing that her right-wing rivals had been trying to remove her from office ever since her re-election.
