Lockerbie data centre planning extension explored

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A long-running bid to build an internet data centre in southern Scotland looks set to seek a further time extension to its planning consent.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The plans at Peelhouses Farm north of Lockerbie first surfaced in late 2008.
They were granted planning permission in principle in 2010 which was extended by a further three years in 2013.
Now developers have indicated they intend to seek more time for work to start and also look at carrying it out on a phased basis.
The scheme first emerged about seven-and-a-half years ago with the promise of an Â£800m investment and the creation of thousands of jobs.
It pledged to turn the site into an "international hub for the internet age".
Initially the scheme also included a major housing development but those proposals were subsequently dropped.
The latest plans include a data centre, technology park, horticultural research facility and visitor centre.
Consultants WYG have contacted Dumfries and Galloway Council on behalf of planning firm Blackmores to discuss extending the time limit on permission for the scheme which would currently run out later this year.
