Virgin Trains has created a cairn at Carlisle Station to mark the Quintinshill crash.
On 22 May 1915, five trains carrying troops, civilians and freight collided near Gretna Green killing 226 and injuring even more.
The driver and fireman from the troop train both came from Carlisle and the disaster devastated the community.
Tim Gorst, Virgin Trains' customer service assistant at Carlisle, said:  "It's important that such a momentous event on the railway, Britain's worst disaster, is commemorated in proper fashion.
"It has more poignancy with the soldiers that died heading towards a terrible conflict, but also the civilians and railway workers who lost their lives should be remembered."
The stone-laying ceremony was presided over by the Lord Lieutenant of Cumbria Claire Hensman.
Adrian Quine, a journalist who has extensively researched the Quintinshill tragedy, said: "Carlisle is particular significant as it was an important railway city with a very close knit family."
On Friday a private ceremony will be held at Tullie House, while on 26 May flowers will be laid on the graves of driver Francis Scott and fireman James Hannah at Stanwix Cemetery in Carlisle.
