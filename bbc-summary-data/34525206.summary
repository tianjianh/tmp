[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Peter Rombough, 22, from Ditchingham, Norfolk, had pleaded guilty to stalking the actress, who plays Ronnie Mitchell in the soap, at her Bedfordshire home.
He admitted entering the grounds, delivering letters and communicating with her over social media.
Sentencing has been adjourned, pending a probation report.
Rombough has been bailed and his sentence hearing transferred to Great Yarmouth.
Nicole Burt, defending, said: "A psychiatric team in Norfolk will be the people responsible for supervising his treatment."
Luton Magistrates Court heard Rombough travelled 93 miles from his home on two occasions to the soap star's address in September.
On 4 September, he arrived in the late morning and delivered a love letter in a post box at the side gate of her family home.
Five days later the actress saw a light from his mobile phone in the early hours of the morning.
Later, while sitting by a wall outside the house he was confronted by her husband Mark.
He left and posted an apology to the couple on Twitter, which said: "I never meant to cause upset. I am very sorry."
At an earlier hearing, the court heard he admitted to the police his fantasies about Ms Womack had started in 2009 when he was 16.
He said he had an unhealthy crush on her that was out of control.
Both the actress and her husband have made impact statements in which she said she was distressed, but hoped Rombough would receive help.
Rombough was bailed with a condition not to contact or communicate with Ms Womack and to live at home.
