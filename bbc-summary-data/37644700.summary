The Clown Doctors were due to mark 10 years of visiting sick youngsters at Newcastle's Great North Children's Hospital.
But they postponed the event after a group called North East Killer Clowns published a "hit list" of targets which included the hospital.
The list also included local schools.
The Clown Doctors usually visit wards at the Royal Victoria Infirmary, where the children's hospital is based, dressed in red noses and white medical coats.

A larger, public event had been planned to mark their 10th anniversary, according to Martin Wilson, director at Tin Arts in Durham.
But, Mr Wilson said, the hospital's security team told him about the killer clown groups' "hit list", and advised him to postpone the celebration.
He said there were fears multiple "creepy" clown sightings could lead to confusion.
"They wouldn't have masks on, just red noses and doctor coats, but the hospital security said they had been placed on a local hit list for the killer clown craze.
"It means we're no longer able to do the bigger event and will have to just stick to the wards," he said.
The clowns' visits form part of the therapeutic treatment youngsters receive.
Mr Wilson estimates they have met more than 30,000 children in 10 years.
Hundreds of sinister clown sightings have been reported across the UK in recent days.
In response to the recent clown craze, police forces across the UK have warned that jokers or criminals using the costumes to scare innocent members of the public face arrest.
Fancy dress shops have been asked not to sell clown costumes to anyone they think might be a prankster.
