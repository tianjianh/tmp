Salisbury and South Wiltshire MP John Glen is to donate his blood stem cells to a cancer patient.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Conservative MP joined the Delete Blood Cancer UK register in July 2013 to raise awareness of the need for blood stem cell donation.
Speaking of the donation, Mr Glen said: "On signing myself up I never thought I would hear from them again but now I have this amazing opportunity."
The transfer will take place at a London clinic on Wednesday morning.
The donations help people with blood cancers such as leukaemia, lymphoma or myeloma where cancerous cells are replaced with healthy cells from the donor.
This can be a life-saving treatment for patients.
Due to patient confidentiality rules, no details will be released about the donor recipient.
Deirdre Taylor from Blood Cancer UK said: "Less than half of those in the UK in need of a lifesaving blood stem cell donation find a matching donor.
"Therefore the patient who John is donating some of his blood stem cells to today is very lucky that he took a few minutes a year and a half ago to register to donate some of his.
"That patient needs them for their survival and John is likely to be the only person registered who had a matching tissue type to the patient."
