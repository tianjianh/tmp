Should she fail to recover, Alisha Butcher will replace the Number eight, who missed Wales' defeat against England.
It was their second defeat of a campaign which has seen them beat Scotland and France.
Wales are currently fourth in the table and head coach Rhys Edwards has been pleased with his side's progress.
"We have shown some excellent attacking intent, and some ruthless defence. We were unlucky not to win last week against England," Edwards said.
"We have one more opportunity to go out and put on a good show in front of another big home crowd."
