On Sunday night, search teams found the body of one of four workers caught up in the blast at Wood Flour Mills, in Bosley, near Macclesfield.
The families of Derek Moore, 62, Dorothy Bailey, 62, Jason Shingler, 38, and William Barks, 51,  have all been informed.
But Cheshire Police said the body has not yet been positively identified.
All four were believed to be working in upper floors of the mill when an explosion and fire reduced the four-storey building to rubble.
Fire and rescue teams have been working to find the missing workers since the blast at around 09:10 BST on Friday.
Firefighters are expected to remain at the mill site for a number of days.
Paul Hancock, chief fire officer for Cheshire Fire and Rescue Service, said the scene was "one of complete devastation".
Police said they would be working in the next few days with the company - which has yet to make any statement about the incident.
They are holding a joint investigation with the Health and Safety Executive.
The site, which manufactures wood flour used for making laminate flooring, was also struck by fires in 2010 and 2012.
