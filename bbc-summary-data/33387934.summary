Four fires are thought to have been set deliberately on Halkyn Mountain, near Flint, between the villages of Halkyn and Brynford in the past month.
The rare grasslands and heathlands are home to protected species such as the great crested newt.
It is also a Site of Special Scientific Interest and a conservation area.
Anthony Randles, of Natural Resources Wales, said uncontrolled wild fires could cause temporary loss of habitat, while repeated burning could do long-term damage to land.
Kevin Jones, arson reduction team manager at North Wales Fire and Rescue Service, said deliberate fires put "tremendous pressure" on resources and could delay crews from attending life-threatening incidents.
"Setting deliberate fires not only damages wildlife but also puts our firefighters and the public at risk," he said.
Anyone caught starting a fire on a Site of Scientific Interest without consent could be fined up to Â£20,000.
