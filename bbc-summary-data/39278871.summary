Pete Winkelman: MK Dons chairman 'stuck by' team at AFC Wimbledon game

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Milton Keynes Dons manager Robbie Neilson says his players "appreciate the support" chairman Pete Winkelman showed them by attending Tuesday's match against AFC Wimbledon.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Winkelman stood in the stands as MK Dons directors decided not to sit in the corporate section.
AFC Wimbledon were formed in 2002 by former Wimbledon FC supporters dismayed by the club's move to Milton Keynes.
MK Dons lost 2-0 on their first visit to Kingsmeadow.
AFC Wimbledon did not name their opponents on the front cover of the programme for the match
And Winkelman, 59, left it late to decide whether to travel to the game as he is deeply unpopular among Wimbledon fans because of his part in the formation of Milton Keynes Dons.
In February, former MK Dons manager Karl Robinson was confronted by a member of AFC Wimbledon's staff when his new side Charlton Athletic visited Kingsmeadow.
Neilson said Winkelman had "stuck by" the players as "everyone wanted to be here together".
He added: "I'm really pleased he did that as the players appreciate the support he gave us."
