[SN]TITLE[SN]
Yeovil Town 2-0 Notts County

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Yeovil began the new League One season in convincing fashion as they cruised to victory over an uninspired Notts County.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Goals from Kevin Dawson and Otis Khan killed the contest by the midway point of the first half as Adam Collin endured a nightmare debut in the Magpies goal.
Collin was at fault for Dawson's 16th-minute opener when he dropped a cross from Khan, leaving the Irishman to slot into an empty net.
And he could have done better seven minutes later when he parried a low effort from Ryan Hedges straight to Khan, who had an easy tap-in as the ex-Manchester United youngster marked an impressive debut with a goal.
With County reeling, Yeovil had further chances to extend their lead before the break as Khan and Dawson both narrowly missed the target from promising positions.
The Magpies looked much more composed in the second half, but a late effort from Jonathan Forte that drew a good save from Artur Krysiak aside, Yeovil never looked threatened as they comfortably closed out a first opening-day win in three years.
