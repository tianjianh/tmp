Aberdeen manager Derek McInnes said there is "no shame in finishing second" to the current Celtic team as he lamented the break-up of his squad.

The Dons lost the Scottish Cup final 2-1, having also been beaten in the League Cup final and finished runners-up in the league to the treble winners.
Midfielders Ryan Jack and Peter Pawlett, winger Niall McGinn and defender Ash Taylor are set to leave.
"I just wish I could keep them all," said McInnes.
McInnes highlighted the massive gap in resources from his club to Brendan Rodgers' Scottish Premiership champions, who were unbeaten in their domestic season.
"My weekly budget for my whole squad will equate to one of their players' salaries," he said.
"We are working at roughly £42,000 a week for our whole squad and we've spent £200,000 putting this team together - one player.
"We rinse everything out of them and their application is second to none."
McInnes is understood to be among the candidates being considered by Sunderland as a replacement for fellow Scotsman David Moyes, who resigned on 22 May after relegation from the Premier League.
However, as he did before Saturday's final at Hampden Park, he refused to say whether a move to the Black Cats would interest him.
"This isn't the time to speak about anybody's future," said McInnes. "Today was all about trying to win a trophy for Aberdeen.
"I love my job here and I've said that time and again. I'm just concentrating from tomorrow on bringing good players into the club."
Pawlett, who did not play at Hampden, has already signed a pre-contract agreement with MK Dons, while Jack has announced he is leaving at the end of his deal.
Northern Ireland international McGinn and Taylor are also out of contract this summer.
"We'll get good players in to help the remaining players and we'll go again," added McInnes.
"It's been a fantastic season. It could have been so much more special by winning the cup, but fantastic none the less."
