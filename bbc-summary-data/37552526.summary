Dominic Newton, 21, was a third year student at the University of Wales Trinity Saint David.
BBC Wales understands he became unwell during the Owls' match at the Townhill campus on Monday evening.
Mr Newton, from the Bristol area, was described as a "big part of university life".
A Welsh Ambulance Service spokesman said they were called to reports of a medical emergency at about 21:05 BST on Monday.
"A rapid response vehicle and two emergency ambulances attended the scene and an adult male was taken to Morriston Hospital in Swansea in a critical condition," he said.
South Wales Police said Mr Newton died at the hospital and the death was not suspicious.
A university spokeswoman said it was "saddened" by the news.
She added: "We would like to remind our students and staff that our professional student services team is available to offer support in confidence."
The university's Swansea campus students' union has paid tribute on Facebook saying: "Dom was a big part of university life in Swansea and will be sorely missed."
