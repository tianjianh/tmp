UN human rights report finds NI concerns

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A wide-ranging United Nations report has expressed concern about how the legacy of the Troubles is being dealt with and with Northern Ireland's abortion laws.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The UN Human Rights Committee monitors how nations fulfil the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.
The committee met earlier this month in Geneva to discuss the UK, in one of its regular meetings to consider how countries that signed the covenant are living up to their obligations.
Here are some of the findings of its assessment of legal and cultural issues in the UK that relate to Northern Ireland.
Unlike the rest of the UK, abortion is only allowed in very restricted circumstances in Northern Ireland.
A woman can only have a legal abortion if it can be proven the woman's life is at risk or if there is a risk of permanent and serious damage to her mental or physical health.
The committee said it was "concerned about the highly restricted circumstances in which termination of pregnancy is permitted under the law in Northern Ireland, and about the severe criminal sanctions for unlawful abortion, thus putting women's life and health at risk and forcing them to travel in order to seek abortion".
"The committee notes with concern that the Department of Justice for Northern Ireland, after having held a consultation on the possible decriminalisation and legalisation of abortion in cases of fatal foetal abnormality and pregnancy as a result of rape or incest, indicated in April 2015 that it would propose legislation to legalise termination of pregnancy only in circumstances of fatal foetal abnormality due to 'complex issues' raised by pregnancy as a result of sexual crimes.
"The State party should, as a matter of priority, amend its legislation on abortion in Northern Ireland with a view to providing for additional exceptions to the legal ban on abortion, including in cases of rape, incest, and fatal foetal abnormality.
"The State party should also ensure access to information on abortion, contraception and sexual and reproductive health options."
The committee welcomed the adoption of the Stormont House Agreement, which contained a number of measures for dealing with the legacy of the Troubles.
However, it said it remained concerned about the "quality and pace of the process of promoting accountability".
It said there was an "absence of a comprehensive framework for dealing with conflict-related serious human rights violations".
The committee said it noted "with concern":
The committee outlined a series of recommendations for the government:
The principle of a Bill of Rights - a law that would protect the fundamental rights and freedoms to which each person is entitled - was part of the 1998 Good Friday Agreement.
Those rights might include the right to life, the right to freedom of religion, the right to freedom of expression, the right to education or the right to good health care. However, it has not been implemented.
The committee said it was "concerned about the slow progress in introducing the Bill of Rights for Northern Ireland", and said the government should ensure it "incorporates all the rights enshrined in the Covenant and expedite the process of its adoption".
The committee said it was concerned about the low proportion of women in the civil service, particularly in Northern Ireland.
It said the government should increase its efforts to achieve equal gender representation in the civil service and judiciary, including temporary special measures.
On the issue of violence against women, it called for the introduction in Northern Ireland of Domestic Violence Protection Orders, as envisaged in the new justice bill.
The committee said it was concerned about delays across the criminal justice system in Northern Ireland, and called for "concrete measures to reduce avoidable delays".
This included the introduction of custodial time limits, it said.
It said it was concerned that the age of criminal responsibility is set at eight years of age in Scotland (and at 12 years for criminal prosecution) and at 10 years in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, "which is not in accordance with international standards".
The government should ensure that the detention on remand of child defendants "is used only as a measure of last resort and for the shortest possible period of time and that suitable bail packages are available", it said.
