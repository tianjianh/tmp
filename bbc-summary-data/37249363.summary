The 24-year-old was playing his fourth game since joining the Dons in August after leaving Championship side Leeds.
But after a collision in the game, the former Manchester United youngster will see a surgeon next week.
Dons boss Karl Robinson said the club was "gutted" for Wootton.
"Despite only being with us for a short time, Scott has made a big impression both on and off the pitch," Robinson told the club website.
"He's a leader and well liked by everyone so this is a difficult one to take, but knowing Scott like I do, he'll come back even bigger and better than before."
