Angela Wrightson death: Girls ignored victim's bid to defend herself

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Two teenage girls continued to kick a vulnerable woman in the head despite her attempts to defend herself, a court has been told.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The girls, who were 13 and 14 at the time, deny murdering 39-year-old Angela Wrightson at her home in Hartlepool in December 2014.
She was found in her blood-spattered living room with more than 100 injuries.
Leeds Crown Court heard the girls left Miss Wrightson with a fractured skull.
The older of the girls told the court Miss Wrightson was waving her arms about in the air as they attacked her.
In cross-examination, prosecutor Nicholas Campbell QC asked the girl, who is now 15: "What was she doing to protect herself?"
The girl, giving evidence via video-link, answered: "Waving her arms about in the air."
Mr Campbell continued: "And why was she waving her arms about?"
She answered: "Because we were kicking her in her head."
The court has heard the two girls went to Miss Wrightson's house on the evening of 8 December 2014 to drink cider.
The jury of eight women and four men heard that the girls left the house during the night and returned in the early hours of the following day.
The older girl told the court she wanted to go back to see if Miss Wrightson was all right.
She said the victim's face was bleeding and agreed with Mr Campbell that her scalp was cut open, adding: "When I walked in I just thought she was going to be how she was but there was loads of blood."
The girl told the court that she did not think Miss Wrightson needed help when the pair left the house for the final time at about 04:00.
She said: "I can't remember if she was bleeding or not, she was just touching her head."
Both girls admit being present at the time the injuries were inflicted.
The older girl admits that she struck Miss Wrightson but the younger girl, who is now 14, denies playing any part in the assault.
Both deny murder.
The trial continues.
