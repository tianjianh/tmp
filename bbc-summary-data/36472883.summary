SNP underlines commitment to named persons service ahead of debate

MSPs are to debate the Scottish government's named persons service, with the SNP reaffirming its commitment to the policy.

The system, which will assign a named person to all young people in Scotland from 31 August, has been controversial with opposition parties.
The Scottish Conservatives are leading their first debate of the Holyrood term calling for a "pause" to the scheme.
John Swinney said the government is "absolutely committed" to the policy.
Holyrood voted to approve the named persons system by 103 votes to nil in 2014, as part of the Children and Young People Act.
It will see figures like family health visitors and senior teachers take on the "named person" role, which the government says will ensure children can get timely access to advice and services when they need it.
However, the Scottish Conservatives question whether the policy is "deliverable in the proposed format", and whether it is "in the best interests of children and families".
Education spokeswoman Liz Smith said the Tories had "deliberately steered clear" of explicitly opposing the policy as a whole in the debate, although the party still wants to see it scrapped.
She said: "The Scottish Conservatives believe there is growing parliamentary consensus for a major rethink.
"But there is also growing concern expressed by many frontline professionals - many of whom have no party political affiliation.
"We believe there is an urgent need to address the practical concerns of professionals and parents about the workability of the policy which, if it is not dealt with, could seriously undermine the welfare of children across Scotland."
Labour has also called for a "pause" in the roll-out of the named persons system, which has been trialled in some areas including Fife and the Highlands, to reassess public support for it.
The Lib Dems have offered "cautious support" for the policy, while the Scottish Greens have spoken strongly in favour of it in the Holyrood chamber.
Deputy First Minister Mr Swinney said the government was still "absolutely committed" to the system.
He said: "We know most children and young people get all the help and support they need from their parents, wider family and community, but sometimes they may need extra support.
"It is impossible to predict who will need this support or when. That is why the named person service is for every child - so concerns are picked up early. This government is absolutely committed to the named person service to ensure no one is left without support when they need it."
Mr Swinney also noted that the Tories appeared to be "backtracking" on their manifesto commitment to scrap the scheme altogether, saying they were "playing politics with this important issue".
The policy has also been backed by a group of organisations which work with parents, families and children.
Ten groups, including Action for Children Scotland, Barnardo's, the Children and Young People's Commissioner and the National Parent Forum of Scotland, signed a letter sent to MSPs ahead of the vote asking them not to pause the roll-out of the scheme.
They said the provisions "formalise the best practice of our education and health services, ensuring that every child, young person and their family has a primary point of contact available if and when they need it."
