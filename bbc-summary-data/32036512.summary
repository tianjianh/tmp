[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The jury in the trial of an architect accused of murdering a childcare worker in the Republic of Ireland has retired to consider its verdict.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Graham Dwyer, 42, from the Foxrock suburb of south Dublin, pleaded not guilty to the murder of Elaine O'Hara.
The remains of Ms O'Hara, 36, were found in the Dublin mountains on 13 September 2013.
She was last seen on 22 August 2012, the day of her alleged murder, near Shanganagh cemetery in south Dublin.
The judge said 40 days of evidence, stretching back over five years, boils down to what happened in the three hours after Ms O'Hara vanished.
He told the seven men and five women they could take as long or as short a time as they needed to reach "a conscientious and properly considered verdict".
