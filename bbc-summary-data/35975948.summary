Torquay United manager Kevin Nicholson says his side must not allow themselves to get distracted as they look to avoid relegation from the National League.

Tuesday's 2-0 win over Chester put the Gulls three points clear of the drop zone, having been 12 points from safety less then two months ago.
"It is a bit harder not to get carried away when you start reading and hearing nice things about yourself," he said.
"But they also realise there's a job to be done and we haven't done it yet."
Torquay have only been beaten twice in their last 12 league games, having lost 17 of their previous 29.
The club have been affected by a number of off-field issues, but are set to be taken over by Gaming International Ltd after the current board agreed a deal in principle last week.
"In fairness to them, most of the time they get the message, most of the time they come into training, win lose or draw, with the same attitude, the same character and the same work rate," player-boss Nicholson told BBC Radio Devon.
"I try and do that myself because the last thing you need to see is a manager over the moon one minute and absolutely full-on depressed the next, but there's work to do."
