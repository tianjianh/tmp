[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Leyton Orient kept their slim hopes of avoiding relegation from League Two alive by beating fellow strugglers Hartlepool at the Matchroom Stadium.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Goals from teenage duo Victor Adeboyejo and Tristan Abrahams, after Rhys Oates had opened the scoring for the visitors, leaves Orient seven points adrift of safety with three games remaining.
The match was played out to a background of protests against Orient owner Francesco Becchetti and, at the end of the game, supporters gathered on the pitch to vent their feelings against the Italian.
Oates had opened the scoring on eight minutes when a poor header by O's defender Teddy Mezague gifted a simple chance to the Hartlepool striker.
Orient levelled 10 minutes later when defender Michael Clark picked out 18-year-old Adeboyejo who stabbed the ball home at the near post.
Abrahams gave the home side a deserved lead on 34 minutes with a wonderful left-footed strike from 18 yards and it proved to be the winner.
Hartlepool, who remain above the relegation zone by just a point, saw Liam Donnelly sent off in added time after the defender picked up two quick bookings for dissent.
