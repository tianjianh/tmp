Despite warnings telling people not to trespass on the railway, crew members from the Flying Scotsman have said that once again they have seen a number of people on the tracks as the historic locomotive passed by.

Thousands of spectators lined the route through Bedfordshire and Northamptonshire to view the locomotive on its way to York.
Earlier this year, spectators went on to the tracks at Biggleswade causing more than eight hours of delays on the East Coast mainline.
British Transport Police said this time they dealt with 10 to 20 incidents. Officers said the message to fans of the locomotive was to stay off the tracks and "stay safe".
