Death crash case against Dundee woman not proven

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The case against a woman accused of causing her partner's death by careless driving has been found not proven.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Vicki Williamson, 36, of Dundee, was charged with causing the death of Liam Thornton, 26, on 12 August 2014.
He died when Ms Williamson's Corsa was involved in a collision with another car on the A956 at Aberdeen's Charleston flyover.
A jury at Aberdeen Sheriff Court found the charge against her not proven by a majority verdict.
During the trial, the court heard that the slip road leading off the A90 was in a "poor" state of repair.
It was worn in places and had a noticeable dent in the road which was often "greasy" in wet conditions.
Ms Williamson told the court during her evidence that she felt as if she had skidded on black ice and her car failed to react to her trying to steer out of the way of the other car.
She was seriously injured in the crash and spent 11 weeks in hospital recovering from broken ribs and a broken pelvis.
A four-year-old child was also injured in the incident.
Ms Williamson wept as the jury found the case against her not proven.
She had previously admitted driving with a defective tyre which was marginally under the 1.6mm limit and fined 80 pounds yesterday.
She was also given three points on her licence.
