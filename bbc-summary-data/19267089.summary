Virgin Media blocks pirate site Newzbin 2

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Virgin Media has become the latest UK ISP to block access to Newzbin 2, a members-only site which provides links to pirated films and music.

The ISP acted after receiving a court order from the Motion Picture Association.
Sky and BT blocked access to the site last year.
Rights holders see such court orders as the best way to crack down on piracy although critics point out that the blocks can be circumvented.
"As a responsible ISP, Virgin Media complies with court orders addressed to the company, but strongly believes that changing consumer behaviour to tackle copyright infringement also needs compelling legal alternatives to give consumers access to great content at the right price," the firm said in a statement.
Virgin Media and other ISPs have also blocked access to The Pirate Bay following court orders from the music industry trade body the BPI.
Data shared with the BBC by one ISP which wished to remain anonymous showed that peer-to-peer traffic dipped when the Pirate Bay block initially happened but returned to normal levels within a week.
Measures to combat piracy outlined in the Digital Economy Act have been slow to come into effect.
The main plan is to send letters to alleged copyright infringers but these will not begin going out until 2014.
