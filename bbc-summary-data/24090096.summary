At least nine people have been killed and more than 20 wounded in a bomb explosion in the north-eastern Indian state of Manipur, police say.

The blast, which took place in a busy area in the capital Imphal on Friday night, reportedly targeted migrant labourers from another state.
No group has so far said it was behind the attack.
The region near the Burmese border is home to many militant groups and has seen decades of separatist violence.
The area is ethnically and culturally remote from Delhi, correspondents say.
Locals accuse politicians of ignoring the state, saying it has not received the investment and development given to the rest of the country.
Police officials said the "high-intensity bomb" was planted in a makeshift tent occupied by non-Manipuri construction workers who had all worked for the same company.
The government condemned the attack as an act of cowardice.
Labourers are frequently brought in from Assam, Bengal and other states to work on government projects.
The remote state has long been affected by insurgent violence, with separatist rebels viewing India as a colonial power.
