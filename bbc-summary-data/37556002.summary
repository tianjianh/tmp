A review of a "great deal" of CCTV and dash-cam footage is under way, Thames Valley Police said.
The 14-year-old was raped after being snatched on her way to school between 08:15 and 08:40 BST last Wednesday.
Officer patrols are continuing in the Summertown area to gather "further witness information", the force said.
Det Supt Chris Ward, head of major crime, said: "We are securing evidence, interviewing witnesses and reviewing the substantial quantity of CCTV, dash-cam footage and information received from the public.
"A team of specially trained officers continues to support the victim."
Supt Joe Kidman, local policing area commander for Oxford, thanked the public for its support.
"I know the shock this rare incident has caused and want to add my thanks for all the support provided by the public," he said.
The teenager was found by a member of public at midday in Cavendish Drive, Marston.
Descriptions of two suspects have been released.
The first offender was a white man who spoke with a northern accent.
He was described by the girl as aged in his mid 20s, balding with shaven dark blonde hair and blue eyes. He was of medium build and about 6ft (1.82m) tall.
Police said he was described as wearing black trousers and a hooded top with one pocket on the front and no drawstrings or logo.
The second man was white, with brown gelled hair, the girl said. He was cleanly shaven and had brown eyes.
He was aged in his late teens or early 20s and described as slightly smaller in build than the first offender.
Police said they were focusing patrols and inquiries on the nearby Marston Meadow area.
