Military personnel, politicians and King George V watched the trials in the park of Hatfield House in Hertfordshire in early 1916.
They hoped the new technology would break the stalemate of trench warfare.
Hatfield owner the 7th Marquess of Salisbury said it was important to mark the centenary of the trials.
"Many large houses played a distinguished part in the war effort between 1914 and 1918," he said.
"Hatfield was no exception - perhaps one of the most noteworthy moments came in early February 1916, when the first tank trials took place."
At the end of World War One, the 4th Marquess was presented with a Mark I tank used in the trials.
In 1969, he gave it to the Tank Museum in Bovington in Dorset.
The exhibition at Hatfield House will run to 30 September 2016.
