[SN]TITLE[SN]
Binstead boy's duvet cover curtain death 'an accident'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The death of a 10-year-old boy who became tangled in a duvet cover which was being used as a curtain was an accident, a coroner has ruled.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Ashton Tuckey, who had Down's syndrome, was found by his mother who initially thought he was looking out of the window at their Isle of Wight home.
He died as a result of "compression to the neck" following the incident in Binstead on 7 December 2014.
His grandmother described him as a "lovely child".
The two-day inquest in Newport was told Jodie Tuckey had called for help after bringing her son outside but despite the efforts of neighbours and paramedics, he died in hospital.
The boy's grandmother, Kathleen Tuckey, told the court Ashton had a "very high pain threshold" and "no ability to call out" for help.
She said the duvet cover had been attached to the window because Ashton would pull at the old black-out blinds, which they felt were unsafe.
