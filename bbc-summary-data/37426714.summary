Ronny Sen joined Christian Rodriguez of Uruguay and Girma Berta of Ethiopia - the other two winners - to pick up a grant of $10,000 (Â£7,702) for his project.
Sen won the prize for his work on the dusty coal town of Jharia in the eastern Indian state of Jharkhand where underground fires have burned for more than a century.
"The underground fire in Jharia has been burning for more than a hundred years now. People who inhabit that space have seen this since they were born. So they are totally aware of it and it's very much a part of their life," he says.
"Many villages which were once thriving with life don't exist any more. They have simply vanished. While some people have left these areas and shifted elsewhere for better jobs and opportunities in other cities, there is a big population which calls Jharia home and keeps on shifting along the blasting mines.
"They are mostly dependent economically on this huge coal industry. They don't have any other skills. So, even if there is fire and subsidence they don't have any other choice but to keep moving along the mines."
"I want to share my concerns with a larger audience. Because, the Jharia story is not only specific and limited to India at all," says Sen.
"It is just a coincidence that Jharia is here. It's a economic, environmental and deeply political problem which is predominantly visible all across the world. I hope that this can initiate a dialogue and show people a small glimpse of a possible future that we are facing."
Sen is a regular contributor to the BBC News site. Some of his previous work:
