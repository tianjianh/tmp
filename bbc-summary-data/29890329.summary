Ebola homecoming: Not a hug or a handshake for two weeks

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
For more than two weeks she didn't touch another person - not a handshake, not a hug.

You just don't do those things in the middle of an Ebola outbreak, and so when Holly Taylor got back from two weeks in Sierra Leone, a hug from her mum felt pretty good.
The 26-year-old was in the country as part of her work for Oxfam, and kept a diary for Newsbeat while she was there.
We spoke to Holly a few hours after she got home.
She's safely back, but the Campaigns Officer says it's "bizarre" to be home.
"I'm thinking about all the people I met - I've left, but they're all still in that situation," she says.
"Everyone in Sierra Leone is going through the most horrible time - not knowing if their family could get ill at any moment.
"They have such determination to do all they can to stop the spread, no-one's giving up.
"That's something I'm really going to think about when I'm back at my desk."
Holly was checked for signs of the disease on her way home.
She flew back via Brussels, where she filled in a form and had her temperature taken.
"At Heathrow when I went through passport control my name was flagged up and they pulled me aside," she says.
"I got taken into a back room and asked some questions and had my temperature checked."
When Holly arrived at Heathrow, her mum met her with open arms.
"It was really, really nice to have a hug because I haven't hugged anyone for weeks because of the no-touching policy.
"You do get used to not touching, but you still have the feeling every time you meet someone - you go to put your hand out and then you quickly remember."
"It was really odd to say goodbye to my colleagues and just kind of wave. I'd been through quite an intense few weeks with them," says Holly.

"I was actually surprisingly sad about leaving. There was definitely some relief, and there'll be relief in 21 days.
"I guess I do feel a bit guilty because I've left and Ebola isn't over yet."
As well as that mix of feelings, Holly is anxious about how people will react to her. She says her boyfriend isn't worried, but others might be.
"I was nervous about coming home for that reason - the way people would react.
"Would I make people awkward if I'm in the same room as them? Do I go and hug people to say hello? Or maybe I don't, and let them decide what they want."
But she's confident she hasn't got Ebola.
"You just remember the fact that it's actually really easy to prevent it," she says.
