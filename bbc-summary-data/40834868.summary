[SN]TITLE[SN]
Gillingham 0-1 Bradford City

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Dominic Poleon's first-half goal allowed Bradford to make it two wins from two in the new League One season as they ground out a narrow victory at Gillingham.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The hosts had striker Conor Wilkinson sent off for good measure as their search for a goal in the campaign goes on, while Poleon will be relieved his glaring miss just before half-time did not prove costly.
Bradford broke through when Alex Jones got to the byline and cut the ball back, with Poleon passing his shot first time into the bottom corner.
Having struggled to create openings, Gillingham finally threatened when Josh Parker forced Colin Doyle into a smart save from a tight angle on the left.
Poleon then somehow missed an open goal after dispossessing Max Ehmer and rounding Tomas Holy while at the other end Parker was just as wasteful, as he stabbed wide from Luke O'Neill's cross.
The Gills' cause was not helped by Wilkinson's dismissal with 15 minutes left for a poor challenge on Timothee Dieng and substitute Liam Nash headed their last chance over.
