The family of a woman whose murder was one of a string of linked incidents on Friday say they have been left "devastated" by her death.

Claire Nagle, 38, died in hospital after being found seriously injured at a house in Borrowash, Derbyshire.
The alarm was raised by a 22-year-old man who suffered head injuries at a house less than a mile away.
Police later said the death of a man on the M1 was linked to both attacks and all three people involved were related.
On Saturday, Derbyshire police's Ch Supt Jim Allen said officers were not looking for anyone else in connection with the investigation.
In a statement, Mrs Nagle's father, Martin Paton, said: "We are devastated at the loss of a much loved, beautiful and vibrant mother, daughter and sister, Claire.
"We believe this was a tragic incident for everyone involved and their families.  We don't want to apportion any blame and wish to be left alone to grieve as a family.
"We'd also like to thank everyone who has offered us messages of support."
The 22-year-old man remains in hospital, police said.
Prayers were held at Stephen's Church in Borrowash and a book of condolence has been opened, which will be given to Mrs Nagle's family.
The Reverend Tim Sumpter said it was important for the community, who were in a "complete state of shock", to have "space and quiet".
An appeal has begun to raise money to support Mrs Nagle's five children, the BBC understands.
Hundreds of drivers were left stranded on the motorway after part of the M1 near Trowell services was closed when a 44-year-old man died in a crash with a lorry.
Det Ch Insp Gareth Meadows said police wanted to hear from anyone who saw a white Ford Focus on the hard shoulder of the M1 on Friday morning, or two men on an overbridge who may have been behaving in an "out of place" manner.
Taz, a tattoo artist based in Station Road, described helping the 22-year-old man.
"There was a young lad lying on the floor, he was a bloody mess. He had multiple lacerations on his face and had lost a lot of blood.
"I just ran back over here, grabbed some gloves and gauze and headed back over to him to see if there was anything I could do."
On Friday a cameraman for BBC East Midlands Today, reporting on the M1 closure, said he saw a body on the carriageway.
Police have urged anyone who may have information about the deaths, or dashcam footage of the motorway, to contact them.
