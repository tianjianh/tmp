An application for an environmental permit to run a landfill site at a Flintshire quarry has been rejected.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Natural Resources Wales (NRW) said plans for the non-hazardous waste landfill earmarked for Parry's Quarry, near Alltami, could cause "significant odour" and "potentially contaminate groundwater".
An application for an environmental permit was also rejected last year.
Planning permission to open the site to landfill was granted in 2009.
Site operators have been advised of the latest decision, said NRW.
NRW team leader Paul Wright said: "Following careful consideration, there are numerous aspects of the application that are unacceptable to us.
"The applicant has failed to justify that the proposals will not be harmful to the environment.
"We are concerned that the proposal could cause significant odour in the area and could potentially contaminate groundwater.
"This would have had a detrimental impact on the residential areas and businesses nearby."
