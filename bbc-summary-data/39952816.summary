Bafetimbi Gomis: Swansea City striker could return from Marseille

Swansea City striker Bafetimbi Gomis could return to the club after a season on loan with Olympique de Marseille, says head coach Paul Clement.

Gomis, 31, joined Swansea on a four-year contract from Lyon in 2014 and, after 17 goals in 71 games, was loaned to Ligue 1 side Marseilles last summer.
The French international has scored 20 goals in 32 appearances this season.
Asked if Gomis could feature for the Swans next term, Clement said: "These are possibilities."
He added: "He is one player I have not spoken to. The last thing I saw was he was keen to stay where he was [Marseille] but if we stay in the Premier League it could be an attractive proposition for him to come and play back here."
Gomis had mixed fortunes during his first two seasons with Swansea, who have secured their Premier League status for next term with a game to spare.
Initially signed as back-up to former Swans striker Wilfried Bony, the Frenchman scored 10 goals in his first campaign, including five in his last six games.
His second season was less productive, with seven goals and several poor performances which prompted criticism from fans and pundits.
"I do not know what exactly happened with why he went," said Clement.
"I do not know. I can not comment on it. I do not know the ins and outs of him leaving and why it was. Was it the club, was it him? I do not know.
"I cannot say that I have seen too many games as I have been so busy with what I need to do. Marseille's a good club and it is not easy the French league. They say Paris Saint-Germain dominate but it is quite a physical league. He has done well."
Two other Swansea players to have spent this season on loan at other clubs are centre-back Kyle Bartley and midfielder Matty Grimes.
Both have been with Championship side Leeds - managed by former Swans boss Garry Monk - and both might still have a future in south Wales.
"When I spoke to Matty Grimes from Leeds, when I spoke to Kyle I said 'you're Swansea players' and before I look anywhere else I'm going to look at what we have got from within," said Clement.
"We want people back pre-season to train and we will go from there."
