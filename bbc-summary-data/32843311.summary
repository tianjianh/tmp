[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man has been jailed for child sex crimes after a victim came forward following the Jimmy Savile scandal.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
William Brown, 78, of Kintore, Aberdeenshire, was found guilty of offences against four boys.
One victim had told the trial:  "Once it came out about Jimmy Savile I thought the person who abused me is still alive. Why should he get away with it?"
Brown was jailed for six years at the High Court in Edinburgh.
The offences were committed between 1968 and 1991.
The former blacksmith gave two of the victims money and told them not to tell anyone.
One of the victims was aged five when he first became a target.
Defence counsel Jonathan Crowe said: "He does acknowledge he has done wrong and he wishes to make a public apology to all those affected directly or indirectly by his actions."
Lord Burns told first offender Brown: "You were found guilty of the most serious sexual offences against four young boys.
"It was clear that you had groomed these highly vulnerable and troubled boys and proceeded to sexually abuse them for a prolonged period of time."
Lord Burns said it was clear from the way victims gave evidence at Brown's earlier trial that they were "highly damaged individuals".
The judge told Brown he would remain on the sex offenders register for life.
