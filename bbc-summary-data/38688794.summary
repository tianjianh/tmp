The crowds were celebrating after Mr Barrow was sworn in as president in neighbouring Senegal, where he is for his own safety. They began chanting "CDS" - short for chief of defence staff - when he mingled with them.
Earlier Mr Badjie was quoted as saying that his men would not fight regional troops on a mission to oust long-time ruler Yayha Jammeh, who has refused to step down.
