The former Plymouth Argyle centre-forward, a free agent since the summer, joined Exeter on Tuesday.
The fan-owned club operates on a tight financial base with a budget of around Â£1.5m for the squad this season.
"There's a spectrum of being ultra safe and frivolous and reckless, and you've got to find a balance somewhere in the middle," Tisdale told BBC Sport.
"Speculation is a large part of it. and how far do you speculate?
"For the 10 years plus I've been here, every pound that we spend is discussed and thought through and decided upon, and you take responsibility as a manager for the money you spend.
"Every now and then we've got to push as much as we can."
Reid scored 50 goals in the last three-and-a-half seasons with Argyle, including the first hat-trick in a Devon derby between Exeter and Plymouth in more than 86 years.
The 28-year-old could make his debut against Plymouth on Saturday at St James Park, as the Grecians try and improve their record of just two league wins all season.
"He's a very good proven striker at League One and League Two level and perhaps a missing part of our jigsaw at the moment, " added Tisdale.
"I think we've got a good group of players, if they're fit, but looking at the season ahead, maybe this is something that gives us an edge.
"The irony is we're playing Plymouth this Saturday, it'd be a big enough game without the added topic of Reuben, but he's an Exeter player now.
"It's great that the board have stretched themselves and done everything they can to make this work, as always at Exeter pounds and pennies make all the difference, but I have to say it's a real big step for the club."
