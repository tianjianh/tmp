[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Police said the 71-year-old was one of three men walking on Kells Avenue at about 08:25 BST.
A red car stopped beside the group and two men got out. The assailants attacked two of the men in the group and stole a wallet.
One of the attackers also produced a hammer and threatened the men with it.
Police said the car was a Volkswagen Golf with a southern-registered number plate.
They are also investigating if there is a link between the attack and a report of criminal damage to a car in Oramnore Drive at the same time.
It was reported that two men in a red-coloured car smashed the windscreen and passenger window of a Toyota car parked on the street.
The police have appealed for witnesses.
