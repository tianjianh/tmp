The Colima volcano is one of 3,000 located in Mexico but only 14 of them are considered active.
The ash travelled far enough to cover towns which were several miles away but authorities have told residents that they don't need to evacuate their houses.
Have a watch of this video to see the dramatic explosion and get ready...
