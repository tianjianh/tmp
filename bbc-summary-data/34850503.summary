[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
More than Â£500m in new money is trumpeted in the new agreement between Northern Ireland's political parties and the British and Irish governments.

But even if that stacks up it is effectively offset by funds that have to be found from Stormont budgets to pay for welfare mitigation.
The cut in corporation tax will also have to be paid for, but the bills for that will not arrive until 2019.
All this is taking place against a tough public spending environment directed from Westminster.
Stormont can expect its so-called block grant to fall by up to 2% a year until 2019-20.
Savings made through public sector redundancies and other measures should ease a bit of the pressure.
Senior officials tell me the implementation of welfare reforms will make the budget "manageable."
But even with this agreement Stormont's finances will remain under pressure.
