The 25-year-old from Cornwall left it late to finish third alongside her guide Nicole Walters.
"At one point we didn't think we were going to do it, but we managed to get it on the line," Reid told BBC Sport.
"I'd love to go to Tokyo - it's one of my favourite places in the world and I think I'm young enough to compete."

Reid, a former world champion and European silver medallist, was competing in the first ever Para-triathlon at a Paralympic Games.
"My dad didn't think I'd finished third because we were in fourth place up until the last 100 metres," she added.
"He sat back and it took him about half an hour to realise that we'd crossed the line in third place."
