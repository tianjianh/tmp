Speaking to BBC Wales, Mr Bryant said someone with "resilience" was needed after the party's election defeat.
"She has that strength of personality that I think we're going to need in these next few years as we try to rebuild the party," he said.
His support for Cooper comes after Ed Miliband stepped down and sparked a Labour leadership bid.
A number of party members have announced they are in the running to lead the party, including Liz Kendall, Andy Burnham, and Mary Creagh.
Rising Labour star Chuka Umunna also threw his hat in the ring but has since withdrawn his bid, blaming the level of press scrutiny upon his family.
