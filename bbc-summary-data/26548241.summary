Singer Charlotte Church might make a surprising change of direction - by studying for a degree in physics.

Her fans may have noticed a sci-fi inspired theme in her recent performances and music, but now she wants to go a step further.
The performer has no interest in giving up singing - which she describes as her "lifeblood" - but said it was important to "keep educating yourself".
She was speaking to BBC Wales at the launch of its new music talent scheme.
"I want to go and do a degree in physics - I will have to do an A-level in physics and maths first though," she said.
"I just think it's important to keep the brain active and keep educating yourself.
"I have an interest in it and I should try to follow it. It's something I've been interested in for the last year or two."
She said much of her interest had been sparked by sound engineer and producer Gethin John.
"He was always explaining different theories and I became interested in it through him and started buying New Scientist and geeking out about it all!" she said. "Why not?"
Her performance in school before her musical career took over certainly bodes well.
She had a string of top grade GCSEs from Howell's School in Cardiff - including an A* in music, French and history, and As in geography, maths, English literature and English language.
And an interest in science is not unknown in the music industry with Professor Brian Cox swapping life in the band D:Ream to further pursue his love of physics.
He is not only an academic but is well known as a presenter of several science programmes for the BBC.
For now, Church is pressing ahead with her new music.
She has just released the fourth of a series of five EPs, and sported a sci-fi-inspired look when performing the new tracks at a colourful show earlier this month.
The show was called Entanglement, after the EP's main track and the scientific theory that inspired it.
Church has no plans of giving up her singing career despite the work a degree would entail.
"Music is in my veins so I'm going to have to carry on - it's my lifeblood which is brilliant," she said.
She spoke of her interest in physics while backing the Horizons music talent scheme which looks for 12 new artists in Wales to support over the next year.
BBC Wales and the Arts Council of Wales aim to "showcase the most exciting unsigned acts with the potential to make a real breakthrough in Wales and beyond".
The acts will be picked by a panel of music industry and radio music experts.
