Heathrow third runway: Theresa May's Maidenhead constituents react

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
In 2009, Prime Minister Theresa May told her constituents in Maidenhead "we must say no to a third runway at Heathrow". However, campaigners say her government's decision to build the runway after all will result in a significant increase in flights above the Berkshire town. So what do people living there think about her change of heart?

Campaigners against expansion at the airport say a third runway will result in 250,000 extra flights a year.
Currently a large proportion of flights approaching Heathrow skirt Maidenhead, but under proposed flight path alterations more air traffic will fly near the town and nearby Sonning, where the prime minister lives.
"Theresa May has never been a fan of Heathrow expansion, partly because she has lived under the flight path and partly because she knows that the feeling in her constituency is that they will suffer under expansion," says John Stewart, chairman of anti-Heathrow expansion group Hacan.
"I think a lot of people will feel let down [in her constituency], particularly when there is a viable alternative, which is a second runway at Gatwick."

Conservative-led Windsor and Maidenhead Council will now find itself at loggerheads with its local MP, as it has pledged Â£50,000 towards legal action against Heathrow expansion.
Leader Simon Dudley has said councillors will do "everything we can do to stop Heathrow being expanded", adding: "This is just the beginning."
In the town itself, many locals are unhappy with their MP's decision.
"Personally I don't think it's necessary," says mother-of-two Nikki Cadle. "We get affected by a lot of the air traffic... I don't think it's right.
"She should be listening to the opinions of the locals on what we want, not what they think is right for us."
Another, Frances White said she was "furious".
"When the flight plans are changed I'm woken up early in the morning. Why not Gatwick?
"It's unconscionable, I really don't agree with it."
A Downing Street spokeswoman said the decision to expand Heathrow was not a constituency matter and had been taken in the national interest.
In fact it is not difficult to find residents in favour.
"First and foremost I'm glad they've made their mind up because since I moved here more than 30 years ago there's been constant dithering," said Rob Bird.
"Heathrow is probably the logical choice but lots of people are going to be upset and annoyed about increased noise and traffic."
Another, father-of-one Ben Hulks said: "As prime minister, Theresa May is in the role to make these big decisions for the country, a lot of what is being done is better for post-Brexit Britain.
"But I'm not sure how it's going to be viewed by local constituents and I can see how some might see it as hypocritical."
Mrs May's decision to recommend a third runway at Heathrow could almost be seen as sacrificial, as it will have a direct impact on her home. Sonning, north east of Reading, will likely be impacted by noise pollution. But few in the idyllic village seem to care.
"I think it's a good idea - I think we do need a new runway," said one villager, Helena Absalom.
"It's far easier to get to than Gatwick, so I think it's better that they're expanding Heathrow."
Meanwhile John Bodman, who lives a few miles away in Emmer Green, says he believes the third runway will bring business and jobs to the area.
"Where I live there are planes in the morning that do wake me up, but I don't mind that because I'm regularly travelling on those planes," he says.
"Theresa May's done a great job and we're really pleased."
