The supporters of the Conference South side are hoping to raise a maximum of Â£1.25m in order to buy the club and and run it as a community-owned asset.
A fundraising campaign is taking place over the summer where people interested in investing can buy shares priced from Â£250 to Â£100,000.
Mr Loach said: "It needs the whole city to get behind the project."
The life-long fan of the club said the takeover bid could "set us on the road for a successful future, long-term."
"It seems a big challenge, but actually it's quite possible," he added.
Big Bath City Bid chairman Jon Bickley said: "We know that we are asking for a big investment from the local community - people will rightly expect to see a solid and sustainable business plan before they buy shares.
"We are confident that we have the right approach to return the club to profitability."
If the campaign is a success, a binding offer will be made towards the end of the fundraising period.
Bath City FC said it was broadly supportive of Big Bath City Bid's aims, but remains open to all options.
The campaign is being launched at an event at the Guildhall in Bath later.
