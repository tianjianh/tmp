Ashton's mouth appeared to make contact with Waller's hand during a tangle on the floor in the first half of Sarries' 27-12 win on Saturday.
Referee Greg Garner took no action, and Ashton's fate now rests with match citing commissioner Mike Rafter.
"There is a good chance Chris will be cited, so we will see what happens," Sarries boss Mark McCall said.
Northampton director of rugby Jim Mallinder confirmed after the game that Waller said he had been bitten on the hand.
Speaking at his post-match news conference, McCall added: "I have heard the accusation. I haven't seen the incident. These things will run [their] course."
Ashton received a 10-week ban last season for making contact with the eye area of Ulster back Luke Marshall during a European Champions Cup game, although he protested his innocence throughout.
That suspension ruled him out of England's Six Nations campaign, and the 29-year-old has not featured for the national side since Eddie Jones became head coach.
Meanwhile, Waller could also face further action after receiving a yellow card for a second-half clash with Jamie George after performing a dump-tackle on the Saracens and England hooker off the ball.
Waller, 26, could be in trouble not only for the tackle, but also for the resulting skirmish when his head made contact with George's face.
