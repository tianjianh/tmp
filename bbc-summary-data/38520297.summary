They were struck by a BMW as they walked on Broadway in Yaxley, near Peterborough, at about 11:10 GMT on Tuesday.
The men have been named locally as Thomas Fletcher, aged 19 and 22-year-old Thomas Northam.
Their friend, Frazer Love, said: "They were both so kind, gentle and funny. When I found out, my heart just broke."
Thomas Fletcher had been studying engineering at Peterborough Regional College. A spokeswoman said: "The department is saddened to hear of the loss of Thomas at such a young age.
"Thomas showed a lot of potential as an engineer and was well liked by his fellow students and lecturers alike.
"Thomas was always friendly, and was helpful to his fellow students in his class and able to share his skills and experience to help them with their work."
There will be a service of remembrance at St Peter's Church in Yaxley on Sunday.
Vicar, John Randall, said: "People are shocked and saddened. There's a desperate sense of loss.
"It's a close-knit community. We'll be praying for the families and looking to do whatever we can to support them."
The driver of the car fled on foot after the collision on Tuesday morning and a police helicopter and dog unit were brought in to help in the search.
A 38-year-old man was arrested in Chelmsford later that night on suspicion of causing death by dangerous driving and actual bodily harm.
A briefcase containing "a quantity of cash" was also found in the Yaxley area, Cambridgeshire Police said.
The force confirmed that the briefcase had been forensically examined and that detectives were still trying to establish where it came from.
