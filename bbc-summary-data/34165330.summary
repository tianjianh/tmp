World Cup 2015: Leigh Halfpenny and Rhys Webb worry for Wales

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Wales could be without Rhys Webb and Leigh Halfpenny at the World Cup after they came off on stretchers in their 23-19 warm-up win over Italy on Saturday.

Webb, 26, suffered ankle damage at a first-half breakdown at Millennium Stadium in Cardiff.
Halfpenny damaged his right knee in the 70th minute.
Wales coach Warren Gatland said: "They don't look too good at the moment, but we'll just have to wait and see."
Webb underwent a scan on Saturday night and Halfpenny will do the same on Monday.
Gatland said Webb's injury was "not a break, but could be ligament damage".
He added: "If the injuries are bad we might have to bring in players, but we won't know until next week.
"You have to feel for them if they are ruled out. It's a massive blow for them and disappointing for us."

Webb has established himself as Wales' leading half-back while 26-year-old Halfpenny is their main goal-kicker.
If Webb is ruled out, Racing 92 veteran Mike Phillips is a leading candidate to be recalled, having been omitted from the original 31-man squad.
On the eve of the match, Wales defence coach Shaun Edwards had said: "It would be a travesty to get someone injured so late."
Before the Italy game, Gatland said Scarlets back-three star Liam Williams would take a full part in training next week.
Williams has not played since having foot surgery in the summer and would be the leading candidate to take over from Halfpenny.
Versatile backs James Hook and Gareth Anscombe are also call-up candidates, although the latter has an ankle injury.
