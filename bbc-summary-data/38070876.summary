Callum Brown, from Kirkcaldy, was 18 when he crashed the car leading to the death of his passenger, 16-year-old Brian Phimister.
The crash happened in the early hours of 5 June 2015 near Kirkcaldy.
Brown was jailed for three years and four months for what the judge said was "a needless loss of life".
He pled guilty to causing death by dangerous driving during a hearing at the High Court in Edinburgh last month.
Police investigators found Brown was driving at at least 58mph in a 40mph zone when he crashed the car on the Coaltown of Wemyss to Dysart road.
Brown, who had a previous conviction for speeding, lost control on a bend and when emergency services arrived they found his vehicle lying on its side and "folded around the tree".
Detectives investigating the death of Brian, who was known to friends as Phimmy, concluded that Brown was speeding due to skid marks left on the road.
At the High Court in Paisley, Judge Craig Scott QC told Brown he would have to live with the consequences of his actions for the rest of his life.
He said: "Following the impact with the tree, and judging by his injuries, Brian Phimister had no chance of surviving.
"You, on the other hand, did survive and you have survived to bear witness to what was a needless loss of a life - caused entirely by the manner in which you chose to drive your car.
"All with no regard for the consequences and, particularly, for the life of your good friend. In a few moments, your car sped out of control on its way to tragedy."
Judge Scott said he would have jailed Brown for five years were it not for his guilty plea.
He added: "It seems to me the only redeeming features concerning the circumstances are that no other road users were involved and no factor apart from excessive speed was involved."
The judge also banned Brown from driving for five years and told him he must pass an extended driving test before getting behind the wheel again.
