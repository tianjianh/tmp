[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
One of Cornwall's food banks is struggling to cope with the increased level of demand, its co-ordinator has said.

Don Gardner, from Camborne, Pool and Redruth charity, said it provided more than 2,000 meals in two hours recently.
The centre has announced it is extending its opening hours because of the level of demand for its service.
The MP for Camborne and Redruth, George Eustice, said there was help for those "who are in real genuine need."
Mr Gardner said: "It's been absolutely horrendous since Christmas. Last week in Camborne alone - 2,180 meals in just two hours.
"We were expecting an increase after Christmas but nothing like this.
"The food coming in has been outstripped by demand, so I am having to go out and buy food to top it all up."
Two years ago the centre was providing fewer than 10 families with food.
Mr Eustice, the Conservative MP for the area, said: "These are very difficult times.
"I know there are pressures on household bills, but we do have a benefits system that is there to help people who are in real genuine need."
Mr Gardner said: "Fortunately we have very generous donations from people.
"One man stopped me and said he liked what we were doing, and gave me Â£500. All of that is going to supplement our shortfall."
