Whitsand Bay illegal dredging single offence fine welcomed

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A dredging company has been fined £40,000 for illegally dumping waste off the Cornish coast.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Westminster Dredging Company Limited was charged with depositing material from Plymouth's Devonport Dockyard in Whitsand Bay, near Rame Head.
The firm had a marine licence for only one of the 32 disposals it made in September last year.
Campaigners opposed to the dumping say they are pleased, but disappointed there were not more charges.
The case, at Plymouth Magistrates' Court, was brought by the Marine Management Organisation (MMO) following a complaint by a member of the public.
Westminster Dredging Company Limited, which admitted the offence, provided the MMO with the full coordinates for each of the unlawful disposals.
It said a failure of internal procedures had resulted in the master of its vessel, the WD Mersey, not being aware of the restrictions on the depositing of the dredged material.
The firm had previously received an official written warning in April last year from the MMO about two breaches of its marine licence, including one of depositing material.
Campaign group Stop Dumping in Whitsand Bay said it was disappointed not to have been given the chance to speak to the court prior to sentencing on Friday.
"It's a two-fold reaction for us, as on the one hand we welcome the fine, seeing it as a step forward to show the contractor it's being watched," spokesman Dave Peake told BBC News.
"On the other hand, we're mystified and very disappointed as to why it was only charged with one of the illegal dumps and not all 31 of them.
"To a company with an annual turnover of millions, a £40,000 fine is just a slap on the wrist."
Mr Peake added that the group now intends to ask the MMO how it concluded the likely environmental impact of the 31 illegal deposits, were "within acceptable limits".
The campaigners fear continuing to dump contaminated silt from the dockyard at Whitsand Bay could affect protected marine species in its Marine Conservation Zone.
The Royal Navy has previously stated that dredging is essential to give its ships access to the dockyard.
