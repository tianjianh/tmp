The wall, which was nine feet high, was sent crashing down in Listmas Road, Chatham, just before 22:00 GMT.
Equipment normally used to find casualties buried under collapsed buildings was drafted in to help specialists assess the damage.
A fire service spokesman said no-one was injured, adding that the cause of the collapse was unknown.
