Sean Banks, 18, was stabbed through the heart by Paul Kane, 25, in September last year. He was helped by 19-year-old Liam Donnelly.
After being convicted of murder last month, Kane was jailed for life, and told to serve at least 17 years.
Donnelly, of Bothwell, was found guilty of culpable homicide and he was ordered to be detained for nine years.
The pair were sentenced by Lord Armstrong at the High Court in Edinburgh.
During their trial at the High Court in Glasgow, jurors heard that the men attacked Mr Banks after learning of claims he had assaulted a teenage girl.
The court heard that the 18-year-old from Viewpark, Lanarkshire, was stabbed four times after being confronted in Uddingston on 12 September.
He died later in Monklands Hospital in Airdrie.
But Kane told the trial he did not strike the teenager deliberately, adding: "I can't remember stabbing him."
He went on: "I didn't mean for him to die. He kept coming at me."
Ahead of sentencing, the court heard that Kane had 16 previous convictions, mostly for violence.
Donnelly's lawyer, Tony Graham, said his client had a good work and educational record.
Speaking following sentencing, procurator fiscal Nicky Patrick said: "Paul Kane chose to take up a knife with the purpose of doing his victim serious harm.
"This is another, sadly all too familiar incident where a knife has led to a needless death and ruined lives.
"The use of blades as weapons is completely unacceptable and as prosecutors, we will continue to do our utmost to prosecute those who are responsible for violence and knife crime."
