British number two Aljaz Bedene says he has "found his game" despite losing to world number one Novak Djokovic in the third round of the French Open.

Bedene fought bravely and twice broke his opponent's serve, but lost 6-2 6-3 6-3 on Court Philippe Chatrier.
"I think I found my game now, so it's good to see, especially before Wimbledon. I just have to build it up," said 26-year-old Bedene.
The tournament at Wimbledon is the next Grand Slam and begins on 27 June.
Bedene began brightly but his best groundstrokes were all returned well by Serbian Djokovic, who had to battle for more than two hours for victory.
The Slovenia-born world number 66, who became a British citizen in March 2015, added: "I guess the confidence is back. I'm working hard, but it's about just working hard and improving the things which were not the best.
"Obviously when you play someone like Novak, you can see where the weaknesses are, so I'm going to work on that."
Andy Murray is the only Briton left in the competition and faces American John Isner in the fourth round on Sunday at about 14:00 BST.
Meanwhile, 29-year-old Djokovic has appealed to event organisers to build floodlights on Roland Garros' showpiece court.
He had to complete his third-round match at 21:30 local time (19:30 BST) as the light faded.
"It was getting dark," said Djokovic, who is looking to win the French Open for the first time. "For a Grand Slam, you need to have lights.
"I'm really hoping we can have that very soon for these particular situations, especially considering the fact that the forecast for the weather is not that great in the following days."
