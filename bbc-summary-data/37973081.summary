Southend United striker Nile Ranger said his first goal against Bury on Saturday was inspired by the "finesse" shot on the Fifa video game.

The 25-year-old ended a 735-day goal drought with a low, curling right-footed strike against the Shakers.
"I play too much Fifa, I tried to put the finesse on it and it worked, so I'll try it again next game," Ranger told BBC Essex.
He then added his second and his side's third in a 4-1 League One victory.
The former Newcastle, Swindon and Blackpool striker joined the Shrimpers in the summer, but has been restricted to just six appearances because of injury.
Having not scored since 8 November, 2014, Ranger helped Phil Brown's side stretch their unbeaten run to five matches.
"From the first goal I was buzzing so I thought 'you know what, let me try to get a second one'. That was the first brace of my career," said Ranger.
"I don't really get goals like [his second]. That's my first left-footed goal as well."
