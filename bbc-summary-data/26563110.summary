[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Work on a £17.4m replacement railway station in Worcestershire has started.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Plans for the station in Aston Fields, to be built about 320ft (100m) from the existing Bromsgrove station, were approved last year.
The station will increase capacity to four platforms with a 350-space car park and should lead to a more frequent rail service between Bromsgrove and Birmingham, train operators said.
Stage one of the work is due to be completed by May 2015.
Further work to bring all four platforms into use could take 12 months longer.
