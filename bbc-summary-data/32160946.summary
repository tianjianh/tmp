[SN]TITLE[SN]
90-year-old tortoise Mrs T attacked by rat in Pembroke

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An animal lover was left horrified after a rat chewed off part of the legs of her 90-year-old pet tortoise.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Linzi James, of Pembroke, put the tortoise, called Mrs T, in her garden shed to hibernate where it was attacked by the rat.
She found the reptile on her lawn with injuries to her two front legs.
Rats attacking tortoises is not uncommon and in 2013 Britain's oldest tortoise, 130-year-old Thomas, died after a rat attack.
