Police investigating the disappearance of Alice Gross are reviewing material from 300 CCTV cameras covering a six-mile radius, the Met has said.

The 14-year-old has been missing since 28 August, when she was filmed on CCTV walking along the Grand Union Canal.
Scotland Yard said 30 detectives were viewing the footage in the "ever-expanding search".
Detectives continue to search for convicted murderer Arnis Zalkalns, named as the main suspect in the case.
Mr Zalkalns, 41, was filmed cycling along the canal 15 minutes after Alice was seen and went missing from his Ealing home on 3 September.
The Latvian was convicted of his wife's murder in 1998 and served seven years in jail before moving to the UK in 2007.
Det Supt Carl Mehta said: "CCTV is clearly crucial in our investigation, but we still need the public's help and I want to hear from anyone who saw Alice during the afternoon of the Thursday she was last seen.
"In over 30 years of policing I have never seen such a strong community reaction, this is a community that is totally behind the search to find Alice and bring her home."
Earlier this week a reconstruction of Alice's last known movements prompted 150 new calls from the public.
On Friday police searched a section of Elthorne Park in west London following reports of an area of disturbed earth, but this was later ruled out of the investigation.
Detectives are continuing to search a stretch of the River Brent and officers have also been in the Latvian capital Riga, although Scotland Yard said there was no evidence to suggest Mr Zalkalns was there and stressed he was one of many lines of inquiry.
Alice's parents have urged the public to "please, please help us" in the search for their daughter.
Her mother Rosalind Hodgkiss said: "Every morning, as Alice's disappearance grows longer and longer, brings new agony, new anguish."
The hunt for Alice, from Hanwell, west London, is the largest Met Police search operation since the 7/7 terrorist bombings in 2005, with 600 officers from more than 20 police forces and specialist units involved.
Competitors taking part in the Ealing Half Marathon on Sunday have been told they can wear yellow ribbons in support of the search for Alice.
A reward of up to Â£20,000 is being offered for anyone who has information that leads detectives to find Alice.
Anyone with information is urged to contact the incident room on 0208 358 0100 or 101.
