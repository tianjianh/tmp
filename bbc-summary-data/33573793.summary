Haresfield church clock restoration appeal launched

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An appeal has been launched to raise money to restore a 17th Century clock in Gloucestershire.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The clock in the tower of St Peter's Church, Haresfield, will be refurbished and have electric winders attached.
It was given to the church in 1698 by John Rogers, who owned the Haresfield estate, but it could be even older, according to church officials.
The cost of the clock's restoration will be Â£7,300.
Churchwarden Alec Jeakins said: "Clocks of this age are very rare. It strikes on the hour but hasn't been heard in the village for over 30 years.
"We hope that hearing the clock again will remind villagers of their church.
"There is a plaque on it with the date 1698, saying it was given by John Rogers, but it could possibly have been a second-hand clock even at that date."
Grants of Â£1,000 from the Barbara Whatmore Charitable Trust and Â£500 from the Gloucestershire Historic Churches Trust have already been secured.
