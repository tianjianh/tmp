Hull woman upset at 999 bus lane warning letter

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A Hull woman said she was upset after receiving a warning letter for driving into a bus lane to let an ambulance on an emergency call pass.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Lynne Plaxton received a penalty notice from Hull City Council after one of its new cameras caught her entering the bus lane on Anlaby Road in west Hull last week.
She avoided a Â£60 penalty as fines will only start to be issued from August.
Mrs Plaxton said she should not have been sent the letter.
"You can clearly see in the photograph I've pulled across for an ambulance," she said.
"I just thought that you had to pull across and give way to an emergency service and I've just automatically done that, which obviously I won't be doing again."
She claimed that when she talked to the council an officer told her she should have remained where she was and allowed the ambulance to use the bus lane.
The Highway Code states that when approached by an emergency vehicle drivers should "consider the route of such a vehicle and take appropriate action to let it pass, while complying with all traffic signs".
In a statement Hull City Council said: "Where a motorist has taken evasive action to get out of the way of an emergency vehicle, this would clearly constitute mitigating circumstances, as was the case in this instance."
Bus lane cameras were installed at a number of sites across Hull on 14 July.
The council is operating a two-week grace period during which drivers will be issued with warning letters but not fined.
Penalties of Â£60 per offence will start from 1 August.
