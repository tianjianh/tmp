Updates on this story and more from Oxfordshire
The Weston, linked to the world-famous Oxford University Bodleian Library, began a three-year transformation in 2012.
As part of the Bodleian, it is home to four of the 17 pre-1300 copies of Magna Carta, all of which were exhibited to the public during last year's 800-year celebration.
Librarian Richard Ovenden said: "In our first year, we've received more than double the number of visitors we estimated
"The building has proved its success among both scholars and members of the public and we look forward to welcoming many more people to the Weston Library to learn about the Bodleian's great collections."
It was originally known as the New Library, and was officially opened by King George VI in 1946.
