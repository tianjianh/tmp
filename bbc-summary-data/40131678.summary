The female foal was spotted in the water on Thursday by a dog walker who contacted the animal welfare charity.
The animal, who has been nicknamed Mischief, was later reunited with her mother.
The Scottish SPCA was assisted by Scottish Fire and Rescue's water rescue team to bring the animal safely to shore.
SSPCA inspector Heather Lawson said, "Once she was out of the water it was important to keep her warm.
"My colleagues Dawn-Vale Lowdon and Emma Sergeant and I draped her in blankets and towels until the vet arrived to give her a check over.
"Apart from being cold, exhausted and hungry she didn't appear to have any other injuries.
"She's now been reunited with her mum and has been given the name Mischief.
"We'll be checking up on her today as she was very exhausted and she'll be monitored to ensure she makes a full recovery."
