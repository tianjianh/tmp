Student finance review widened to further education

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A review of student finance in Wales is being widened to consider support for students doing apprenticeships, access and foundation courses.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Education Minister Huw Lewis said evidence gathered by Prof Sir Ian Diamond showed the need for a "joined-up approach", considering links between further and higher education.
The review has been examining the current tuition fee subsidy policy.
Sir Ian said there had been calls for change, but no agreed alternative.
His final report is due by September.
