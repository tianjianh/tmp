[SN]TITLE[SN]
Wrexham plan to end direct elderly day care mooted

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Day care services for elderly people in Wrexham could be provided by third parties and not the council, under new plans being considered.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A report into the proposal was discussed by its safeguarding, communities and wellbeing scrutiny committee on Thursday.
Officers said there has been a "decline" in demand for places and the move could save Â£188,000.
A consultation into the plans runs until next Wednesday.
The authority has two older people's day care centres - Plas yn Rhos in Rhosllanerchrugog and Caia Park - and three day services which were suspended earlier this year due to a "lack of take up".
A further report into the plan will be presented to the council's executive board, after the consultation closes, on 13 December.
