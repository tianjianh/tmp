Thousands of fans are set to descend on the city on 3 June for the final of football's biggest club competition.
The UK government said the security was of "paramount importance" and awarded the grant to South Wales Police.
Welsh Secretary Alun Cairns said ministers were determined "that Wales, and the UK, are seen in the best possible light on the worldwide stage".
He added: "The safety and security of the hundreds of thousands of people set to flood into the city and surrounding areas at this time is of paramount importance."
