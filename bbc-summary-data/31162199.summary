The drivers approached each other after the car stopped in front of the lorry at a crossing.
Police said the attack happened on a busy road and appealed for witnesses
It is believed the car involved may have been a Nissan Micra.
Det Sgt Jim Strugnell, of Surrey Police, added: "This was a nasty incident which left the lorry driver needing surgery.
"I would ask that if you saw either of these vehicles prior to the incident, particularly the manner of their driving as they approached the Slyfield area on the A320 from the Stoke Crossroads area, to get in touch."
The suspect is described as being Asian, aged between 30 and 40, with a short beard and short black hair.
