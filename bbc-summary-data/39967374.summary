Emily Price, from Huntingdon, Cambridgeshire, studied maths and physics and was due to do a Masters degree in Aberystwyth.
She was taken ill after being elected to the town's central ward.
Her family said they plan to establish a memorial at Aberystwyth University.
"She fell in love with Aberystwyth and planned to make her life there," her mother Natasha Price said.
"Emily was special to us as a family and it is comforting to know that she was also loved by so many others.
"Emily was a gentle girl who always had a smile on her face and never said no to helping others. We will miss her terribly, a light has gone out of our lives.
"There are no words that seem to describe Emily, she was quite simply just Em."
Ms Price's family said she enjoyed being president of the physics society at Aberystwyth University and went into local schools to educate children about science.
She loved politics, Sherlock, the Big Bang Theory and Harry Potter.
Ms Price's funeral will take place at Cambridge crematorium on 2 June.
Her family said anyone who loved her was welcome to attend.
The council held a minute's silence at its meeting on Monday, where Ms Price was due to make her declaration to become a councillor.
