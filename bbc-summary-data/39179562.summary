Norwich City: Alex Neil 'best-placed' to take Canaries forward

Norwich City boss Alex Neil believes he remains the best person for the "big, big job" at the Championship club.

After Saturday' 5-1 defeat by Sheffield Wednesday, the Canaries, relegated last term, are 11 points off the play-offs.
"Whether it's me or anybody else, it still remains a big job. I haven't made it a big job," said Neil, who believes the club is in a "transitional phase".
"I know the ins and the outs of the club, the players, and I've now got an opportunity to try to fix things."
Neil retained most of the players relegated from the Premier League, but that squad is ageing.
The XI that started against the Owls had an average age of 28.5, with six players in their 30s.
One of those players is forward Cameron Jerome, who said after the Hillsborough defeat there was a "lack of respect" among his Norwich team-mates, which was harming their Championship play-off hopes.
"Cameron spoke honestly, from raw emotion after the game and a frustration with himself and his team-mates," Neil told BBC Radio Norfolk.
"He knows the detail and the amount of work that we go into to prepare them for each game. I think what he meant by a lack of respect for staff is that when they do all that work and we deliver that sort of performance, that's unacceptable."
Neil said fans of all clubs want honesty from their players and managers.
"I've had people within the club tell me that I'm too honest and don't do myself any favours," he added.
"But I've been a football fan since I can remember, and the worst thing you can hear is other managers trying to protect their own skin.
"I've never done that. I've presented it for what it is and I'm doing everything I can to make it better."
