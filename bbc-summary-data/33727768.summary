The 23-year-old, who was named Spireites player of the year last season after making 56 appearances, has penned a three-year deal at Turf Moor.
"We are delighted to add Tendayi to the squad," Burnley boss Sean Dyche said.
"We have had our eye on him for a while and after playing Chesterfield last weekend, his performance confirmed our thoughts and made the decision for us."
Dyche added to the club website: "He is definitely one who can push for a place in the team now, but also one for the future because we are confident we can improve him as a player because he has a great desire to learn."
