Marcin Pawlow was found with wounds to his hip, thigh and shoulder on Central Drive in the early hours of Wednesday.
The 30-year-old from Poland was taken to hospital, where he died.
Lancashire Police said they wanted to speak to Wojcieh Sylwester Sobisz, 36, from Poland, in connection with Mr Pawlow's death.
Mr Sobisz, who police have not released a picture of, is described as about 6ft (1.8m) tall and of muscular build with a shaved head.
A police spokesman said the Polish national was believed to have travelled from Blackpool to the Midlands on the evening after Mr Pawlow's death and should not be approached.
He added six Blackpool men - aged 31, 32, 33, 34, 45 and 52 - who were arrested on suspicion of murder have all now been released without charge.
