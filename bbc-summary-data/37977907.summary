Wales full-back Leigh Halfpenny has revealed he spotted 18-year-old wing Keelan Giles playing junior rugby a decade ago.

Ospreys flyer Giles could get a debut cap against Japan after being called into the full squad.
"He played for Gorseinon Juniors, you could see he was talented" said 27 year-old Halfpenny.
The pair could now line up together in the back three for Wales in their third Autumn international.
Giles was added to the Wales squad as a replacement for Hallam Amos, having scored eight tries in five Ospreys appearances.
Halfpenny was born in the Swansea suburb of Gorseinon and played in the Ospreys youth system before switching to Cardiff Blues.
"He is a Gorseinon-grown boy, I remember I watched a game one Sunday morning with the club's mini side," Halfpenny said.
"You could see there was something there. He had a lot of gas then and you could see he was talented. Then he moved on to Waunarlwydd. He's an immensely talented kid."
Waunarlwydd is the club where Wales full-back Liam Williams played before his elevation to professional rugby as well as producing loose-head prop Nicky Smith.

Halfpenny himself made his Wales debut aged just 19, against South Africa in 2008, and now has 64 caps to his credit.
"From my experience, the guys just said go out and enjoy it and I think that is what you have got to do. You dream of moments like that as a kid, to pull that Welsh jersey on, you have just got to enjoy it," he continued.
"It is amazing how quick time goes. It only felt like yesterday that I was the young kid coming in, the time's gone quickly, but I have loved every second of it. I am just looking to continue enjoying it and keep on learning."
Halfpenny has yet to announce whether he will stay at Toulon after the end of his current contract in 2017 but he is delighted to be back with Wales after 14 months out of international rugby because of injury.
He added, "It has been an incredibly enjoyable experience to be back playing international rugby. During my injury I missed it massively and I feel really privileged to be back out there playing with the guys in a red jersey again."
