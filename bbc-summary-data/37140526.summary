[SN]TITLE[SN]
Southport 1-1 Tranmere Rovers

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Southport ended Tranmere's perfect start to the National League season as Louis Almond's second-half goal secured a draw.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Rovers appeared on course for a sixth successive win when Andy Cook fired them ahead two minutes after half-time.
Southport's equaliser came 15 minutes later when Almond's cross snuck in at the far post and they held on, despite coming into the game with the leakiest defence in the league, to deny their high-flying derby rivals.
Tranmere's point was still enough to keep them top of the table, a point ahead of Dagenham.
