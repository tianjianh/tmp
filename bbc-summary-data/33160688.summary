Australia's robot-led future puts squeeze on humans

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Almost 40% of Australian jobs that exist today could disappear in the next 10 to 15 years thanks to advances in digital technology.

A new report  by the Committee for Economic Development of Australia (CEDA)  has found that automation in the next generation could transform the shape of the Australian workforce.
The tide of technological change can't be resisted,  but should be seen as a boon for the economy, it is argued.
Robots and automation could eventually replace everything from some nursing and surgical jobs to meal preparation, driving and washing elderly patients.
In some parts of rural and regional Australia more than 60% of jobs could be lost, said CEDA Chief Executive Professor Stephen Martin.
"The pace of technological advancement in the last 20 years has been unprecedented and that pace is likely to continue for the next 20 years," he said.
A more radical suggestion proffered in the report is the idea that robots could "offer support for lonely people".
If that seems hard to believe,  just 10 years ago no-one thought there would be a car that drove itself.
Google has now designed such a car, which has driven around California without any accidents - except when a human driving another car rear-ended the robotic vehicle.
That development alone could dramatically change the Australian workforce where about 25% of all jobs involve driving a car, van, or truck.
Other jobs that could disappear include cytologists who screen calls from patients for signs of cancer and any job that requires routine measurement or pattern recognition.
We might even start growing trees in particular shapes so that robots can pick the fruit.
Machine-learning algorithms are already taking a larger share of skilled jobs such as legal clerks, market research and sales, and credit-risk assessments.
It is vision of the future that isn't all shiny and bright.
The report concludes that while Australia is "uniquely placed" to benefit from digital disruption because of the strength of its service industry and education system, and its proximity to Asia's growing digital markets, Australia will only be able to successfully deal with the disruption technology will bring to the workplace if it is "embedded in the DNA of society".
