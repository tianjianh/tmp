Orient's Mathieu Baudry's had a second-half header cleared off the line before Shaun Brisley hooked the winner home after Notts County failed to clear the danger from a corner.
Notts, who are yet to win at home under Jamie Fullerton, rarely threatened.
Victory leaves Orient outside the play-off places on goal difference alone.
Defeat sees Notts slip to 15th in the League Two table.
Leyton Orient player-manager Kevin Nolan told BBC Radio London:

"Obviously after the disappointment of last week I thought we came here and limited them to very few chances today.
"I'm delighted with the response of the lads from last week and that's the main thing.
"We're going to be looking at what we've done over the last few games at home, but hopefully next week you'll see me smiling like I am today."
