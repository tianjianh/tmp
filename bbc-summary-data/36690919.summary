Their boat capsized around the fourth mark, ending their chances of a top-five finish.
Victory for Burling and Tuke means they remain unbeaten since winning silver at London 2012.
Fletcher-Scott was pleased with how the British pair had performed during the competition.
He said: "It's been a week of two halves really. The first two days were really hard and we weren't sailing very well, but we turned it around and we're really happy how we got back into contention.
"We picked the wind out of the start wrong today. It went left and we didn't pick it up and got caught up in the boat. We knew we got that wrong and tried to nibble away at the leaders.
"We got ourselves up into a reasonable position but pushed it a little hard and capsized, which was game over."
