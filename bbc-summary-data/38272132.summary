[SN]TITLE[SN]
Shrewsbury Town 2-0 Bristol Rovers

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Shrewsbury climbed off the bottom of League One with victory over Bristol Rovers.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Louis Dodds scored for the third time in as many games to give Paul Hurst's side the lead before Ian Black doubled the advantage from the penalty spot, ensuring the Shrews recorded back-to-back league victories for the first time this season.
Rovers almost took the lead in the first minute but Peter Hartley's header from a Charlie Colkett corner clipped the top of the bar.
The hosts broke the deadlock in the 16th minute when Dodds pounced to score his seventh goal of the season from close range after Rovers were unable to deal with Mat Sadler's low cross from the left.
Junior Brown then saw his far-post header impressively tipped over the bar by Rovers goalkeeper Will Puddy before Black and Sylvan Ebanks-Blake both fired narrowly off target.
The visitors enjoyed plenty of possession at the start of the second half, but clear chances were hard to come by and Shrewsbury doubled their lead in the 73rd minute.
Hartley handled Brown's cross from the left and midfielder Black confidently smashed in the penalty.
