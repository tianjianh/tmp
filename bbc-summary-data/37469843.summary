Twaddell agreement: Orange Lodges apply to parade

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Parades Commission is preparing to receive a notification from Orange Lodges in north Belfast for permission to finish a parade stopped since 2013.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Twaddell Avenue protest has been ongoing since July 2013.
But an agreement has now been reached between Ligoniel Orange Lodge and the Crumlin and Ardoyne Residents Association.
It means that three lodges and two bands playing hymns will pass the Ardoyne shops next Saturday 1 October.
Later that day, the loyalist protest camp at Twaddell Avenue will be dismantled.
The dispute - which has cost an estimated Â£20m to police during the past three years - began after a Parades Commission determination not to allow the return leg to pass a section of the Crumlin Road in 2013.
However on Friday, talks facilitators the Rev Harold Good and Jim Roddy released a statement saying a resolution had been found.
Politicians and police have reacted warmly to news of the breakthrough.
First Minister Arlene Foster called it "a significant step".  Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness commended the two facilitators.
However, another nationalist residents group, the Greater Ardoyne Residents Collective (Garc), has made it clear that it is opposed to the deal.
The group's Dee Fennell said: "In our opinion, this goes against the wishes of the vast majority of people living in Ardoyne, Mountainview and the Dales."
