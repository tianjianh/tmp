Heathrow Airport expansion legal action threatened

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Campaigners fighting the expansion of Heathrow Airport have threatened legal action over an "unfair" air quality consultation by the government.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Teddington Action Group claims the Airport Commission failed to conduct a fair consultation on air quality.
It said there had been a "lack of proper engagement" over the consultation and was considering launching a judicial review.
The BBC has contacted the Airports Commission and is awaiting a response.
The commission gave people three weeks to submit further evidence about air pollution on 8 May, but campaigners argue this was shorter than the consultation time usually recommended by the government.
The Teddington Action Group also claims the period was insufficient for people to read the report's 200 pages of technical data.
Spokesman Paul McGuinness said: "The lack of proper engagement by the Commission in relation to the latest air quality consultation is unacceptable and local people should be consulted in a meaningful way on an issue that directly impacts their health and wellbeing."
The group also alleges there could be a potential conflict of interest with commission chairman Sir Howard Davies also acting as a chairman of the Royal Bank of Scotland which works with companies that own Gatwick and Heathrow airports.
The campaigners said they intended to take legal action unless another consultation on air quality is conducted and Sir Howard stands down from his role with the Airport Commission.
Analysis by Kamal Ahmed, Business Editor
It is the first legal challenge to the commission's work. And speaking to members of the Teddington Action Group, they certainly believe it will be the first of many.
Each will delay the commission's findings being implemented - if the government even agrees to them in the first place.
My colleague Richard Westcott wrote about another legal challenge expected by the Campaign for the Protection of Rural England.
And Gatwick has also said it is already considering its legal options should the commission back Heathrow.
Many believe the long grass beckons for the commission's work - and that's before it has even published its final report.
In May, four West Kent parish councils called for more time to put together a "correct and democratic answer" to the consultation on air quality.
The Airports Commission is expected to publish its final report into airport expansion this summer.
It has shortlisted three options: a third runway at Heathrow, lengthening an existing runway at Heathrow or building a second runway at Gatwick.
