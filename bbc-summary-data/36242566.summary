The Etixx-Quick Step rider followed up Saturday's stage win with another imperious display to power home in a sprint finish.
Kittel won by three bike lengths from Team Sky's Elia Viviani and fellow Italian Giacomo Nizzolo (Trek).
Overnight leader Tom Dumoulin (Giant-Alpecin) is second, nine seconds down.
Kittel has now won all four Giro d'Italia road stages he has completed and has 13 Grand Tour stage victories to his name.
He told Eurosport: "It was a super tough day with cross winds making the riders nervous to stay in position and then a breakaway that stayed out in front for some time.
"We had to go full gas. My team-mates did an amazing job to get me to the front at the right moment and give me the best possibilities to start the sprint."
For the second year in a row, there are no British riders competing in the race.
Monday is a rest day as the tour leaves the Netherlands and heads to Italy for stage four, a 191km mountain stage between Catanzaro and Praia a Mare.

1.  Marcel Kittel (Ger/Etixx - Quick-Step) 4hrs 23mins 45secs
2.  Elia Viviani (Ita/Team Sky)  same time
3.  Giacomo Nizzolo (Ita/Trek)
4.  Andre Greipel (Ger/Lotto)
5.  Alexander Porsev (Rus/Katusha)
