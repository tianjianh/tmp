Moygashel: Decision due over using school as polling station

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An announcement is expected later on the future of a polling station at Moygashel in County Tyrone.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Electoral Office had dropped Howard Primary School as a polling station.
It followed claims that loyalist flag protestors prevented some people from voting there at last year's local government and European elections.
However, the Electoral Commission intervened and said the polling station should be reinstated, as the proper consultation process was not followed.
This meant that last month a further consultation period was announced, which included hearing views from voters, politicians, political parties and the police.
The decision that will determine whether polling will take place there in next month's general election is expected to be announced later on Monday.
In the last general election in 2010, Sinn FÃ©in's Michelle Gildernew took the Fermanagh and South Tyrone seat by four votes, following three recounts.
