Uefa opens disciplinary proceedings over Aberdeen laser beam complaint

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Uefa has responded to Aberdeen's complaint after goalkeeper Danny Ward was targeted with a laser beam during the Europa League tie with Shkendija.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
"Disciplinary proceedings have been opened against Shkendija for use of laser pointer - Article 16 (2) of the Uefa Disciplinary Regulations," a statement said.
"This case will be dealt with by the UEFA Control Ethics and Disciplinary body on it's next meeting on 23 July."
Aberdeen drew the first leg match 1-1.
The Dons said a Uefa delegate at the National Stadium in Skopje was informed of the incident after the game.
Hristijan Kirovski's goal for Shkendija cancelled out Niall McGinn's opener.
Aberdeen had pitched goalkeeper Ward, on loan from Liverpool, straight into European action.
