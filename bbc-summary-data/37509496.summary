Palestinian flags were visible during the Champions League play-off first leg at Celtic Park on 17 August.
The Scottish champions progressed to the group stage 5-4 on aggregate.
Meanwhile, Legia Warsaw have been fined 80,000 euros (£69,085) and told to play their next home Uefa competition match behind closed doors.
That followed a series of incidents during their Champions League Group F match against Borussia Dortmund on 14 September.
Uefa's control, ethics and disciplinary body listed charges of crowd disturbances, setting off of fireworks, throwing of objects, insufficient organisation, racist behaviour and stairways blocked at the Polish champions' home ground.
Legia, who host Real Madrid in their next home Group F game on 2 November, lost 6-0 to Dortmund.
