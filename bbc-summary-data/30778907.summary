[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A "thorough review" will be conducted into the disappearance of a Derbyshire man from a hospital, police have said.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Ricky Hill, from Alfreton, was last seen at the Royal Derby Hospital on 23 September, where he was being treated for depression.
A body found in a nearby wooded area on Saturday is understood to be that of the missing 30 year old.
The family, which organised searches for Mr Hill, have asked why his body was not found sooner.
He was admitted to the hospital as a high-risk patient.
At the time his father, Steven Hill, said he was assured Ricky would be sectioned if he tried to leave.
But the hospital insisted that, while it takes the safety and welfare of its patients very seriously, they are free to leave whenever they want because they cannot be deprived of their liberty.
Visiting the site where the body was found on Sunday, members of the family declined to be interviewed but expressed anger Ricky's body had not been discovered sooner and said they were sure the woodland had been searched.
Reverend Gareth Higgs, who lives nearby and spoke to the family, said: "There was of course a lot of sadness and grief.
"One person did express some relief that Ricky had at last been found but the main feeling was one of shock and grief."
A police spokesman said: "Police believe the body to be that of Ricky Hill who went missing from Royal Derby Hospital on Tuesday, September 23. Formal identification of the body is yet to take place.
"Police are conducting a thorough review into all aspects into the original investigation into when Ricky Hill went missing."
