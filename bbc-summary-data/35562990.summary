A terror suspect from the UK who was detained on holiday in Portugal has been freed from jail there, an MP says.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Paramjeet Singh Saini, of the West Midlands, has been fighting extradition to India over his alleged involvement in the murder of a Sikh politician in 2009 and bomb attacks in India in 2010.
Warley Labour MP John Spellar stated Mr Saini's lawyer said the Portuguese government had rejected the case.
The MP said he understood the suspect, from Smethwick, was on his way home.

Father-of-four Mr Saini, who came to the UK about 13 years ago, was granted refugee status to stay in the UK until 2023, along with his family.
Indian authorities have alleged he was a leading member of Babbar Khalsa International, a Sikh separatist group banned in the UK under anti-terror laws.
They also suspect he was involved in the fatal shooting of politician Rulda Singh.
Mr Saini was arrested in 2010 by West Midlands Police, as part of a joint investigation with Indian police, and later released without charge.
Mr Spellar questioned Mr Saini's arrest in December, saying he was protected by European Convention.
Last month, the MP said the Indian government should not be trying to "grab" someone while they were on holiday.
Earlier, Mr Spellar said the lawyer stated Mr Saini had been released from prison in Portugal.
He said: "This is obviously... tremendous news, wonderful for his family, his wife and his four children here in Smethwick and also very good news for the Sikh community as well who've been campaigning for justice for him."
Mr Saini's family have claimed his detention was politically motivated and a breach of his human rights.
