Ms Kirkpatrick, 74, denies two counts of indecent assault and one count of gross indecency with a person under 16.
According to a report by Australia's Herald Sun, the alleged incident took place in the 1980s and involved a 13-year-old girl.
The actress told the Herald Sun that she will fight to clear her name.
"I need to go to court to have this ridiculous situation quashed," she said.
"Allegations have been levelled at me, yes. Are they true? Absolutely not.
"The evidence is in the court. I don't think it's appropriate that I say any more."
Ms Kirkpatrick, who will appear before Melbourne Magistrates Court on 19 August, is best known for playing lesbian prison officer Joan "The Freak" Ferguson in Prisoner Cell Block H.
She appeared in a host of smaller Australian TV shows and in 1991 she played Marilyn's aunt Jean Chambers in Home and Away.
