A British woman who spent a week helping refugees on the Greek island of Kos says she saw people reduced to "eating scraps off the street".

Rachel Miller, 39, of Nottingham decided to volunteer after hearing about the refugee crisis in the news.
"We fed at least 500 people a day with food and water and gave out shoes," she said.
The former social worker, who is married to a Turkish man, said she will return for two weeks in October.
Thousands of refugees have arrived on Kos in recent months after crossing from neighbouring Turkey in small boats.
The majority of those in Kos are fleeing conflict in Syria, Iraq or Afghanistan and many are sleeping in the streets, in tents or abandoned buildings.
Ms Miller said she heard about the refugee crisis and "couldn't face going on holiday when people are starving".
"It was horrific - I saw men eating scraps of food off the floor and the road. They are eating food left on the street for cats - it is heart wrenching," she said.
She described how one young boy from Afghanistan was being held in jail with his father who had been arrested for having forged documents, but she helped to get them both released.
Another nine-year-old boy who was injured in a car bomb attack in Afghanistan was living on the beach with his parents, she said.
Most of the refugees want to go to Germany and not the UK, she said adding that "they don't care where they go, they just want to be safe."
"My husband stayed in the UK to look after our children and I went with some money to spend on the refugees."
She said she helped rescue one three-month old girl and her parents who arrived on the beach at Kos in a dinghy.
"I was holding a 3-month old girl who almost drowned - but luckily some refugees on the beach came to help her and her family."
She said she was not surprised to hear about Alan Kurdi, the three-year-old Syrian boy pictured drowned on a Turkish beach, as "the dinghies are full of water and in the back of your mind you know something like that is going to happen."
She said she is getting some support for her work from donations from an online fund-raising site.
