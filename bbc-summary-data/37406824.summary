The toddler was with her grandmother and their family dog when they were approached by another dog, which was unaccompanied and without a lead.
The dog, possibly a black Labrador Cross, attacked the girl before being fought off by the girl's grandmother.
The young girl is in a stable condition in hospital following the incident at 10:00 on Saturday.
PC David Murdoch said: "A young girl has been seriously injured by a dog which was off its lead and not the in the presence of any owner.
"I would appeal to anyone who either witnessed the incident or has seen a black dog in the area of Troon beach on Saturday morning to get in contact with police officers."
Police said the incident happened near Royal Troon Golf Club, as approached from the Pavilion.
The toddler was taken to the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital in Glasgow.
The dog responsible is described as possibly being a black Labrador Cross, groomed and appeared well looked after.
The animal may have sustained injuries inflicted by the child's grandmother as she fought it off.
