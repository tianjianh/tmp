The organisation Walk Free in 2014 ranked Mauritania at the top of its Global Slavery Index, saying slaves constitute a higher proportion of the population than elsewhere. It says more than 150,000 people are enslaved in Mauritania, or 4% of the population, a claim the government denies, saying slavery has been outlawed.
What's Up Africa is a BBC and RNW co-production and is on Focus on Africa on BBC World News & partner stations across Africa every Friday from 17:30 GMT.
