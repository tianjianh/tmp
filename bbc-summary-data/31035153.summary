Thames Valley Police said a number of people were involved in a fight in Whaddon Way in Bletchley on Tuesday afternoon.
The teenage victim from Lord Grey School was taken to hospital with two wounds, believed to have been caused by a knife.
A police spokesman said the injuries were "not life-threatening".
The force said the incident may have been filmed on mobile phones and have appealed for anyone who saw what happened to come forward.
Supt Gez Chiariello said officers would " leave no stone unturned" in the investigation.
"Patrols in the area have also been stepped up, so the police presence has been heightened and this will be visible to members of the public as a sign of reassurance," he said.
