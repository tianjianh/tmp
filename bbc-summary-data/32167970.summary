[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A horse which fell into a swimming pool after mistaking its protective cover for a patch of grass has been winched to safety.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Maisie had been in a neighbouring field when she got through a gate in Heyshott, West Sussex, and wandered onto the green plastic cover.
She fell in to the water, and fire crews arrived to find her "well and truly stuck" in the pool.
Specialist equipment was used to lift bedraggled Maisie out.
Once safely back on firm ground, she was left in the care of her owners and a vet.
She had wandered onto the green plastic cover thinking it was grass, crew commander Adrian Kirkpatrick said.
Mr Kirkpatrick, of the West Sussex Fire and Rescue Service, said Maisie was taken to a stable, where hay was placed under horse blankets to warm her up.
He said it was one of the first times the specialist all-terrain vehicle used to rescue her had been deployed.
