Doubt over future of Reading mental health service

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A mental health service in Berkshire could be under threat under cost-cutting proposals.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Reading Borough Council is reviewing its mental health recovery services in a bid to slash costs.
The authority will be looking at the care provided at Focus House, a CQC registered home for up to seven patients, as they recover.
Councillors are looking to change mental health services and "divert" Focus House users elsewhere.
The three-month consultation will start on Monday and comes as the authority faces a Â£44m funding gap "due to government cuts".
A spokesperson for the council said they would be looking to keep mental health services "cost effective and sustainable".
They added service users at Focus House could be sent to alternative accommodation to make savings.
Adult and social care councillor, Rachel Eden, said: "Unfortunately, due to major government funding cuts, the council cannot continue to support the existing service as it is."
Proposed changes to the Focus House service include diverting patients to different accommodation for support as they recover and facilities to help them improve their life skills.
If the proposal goes ahead the council said individual plans for patients and staff will be made.
