Deepcut: Police 'questioned Cheryl James suicide theory'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Questions about whether a soldier killed herself at an army base were raised by police as far back as 2002, an inquest has heard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Pte Cheryl James, 18, was found shot dead at Deepcut Barracks in 1995 - amid claims of bullying and abuse.
The army said the bullet wound to her head was self-inflicted, but in 1995 a coroner recorded an open verdict.
A fresh inquest is taking place after Surrey Police were forced to disclose new evidence.
Alison Foster QC, representing the James family, said a Surrey Police officer questioned the suicide theory because of the way the body of Pte James, from Denbighshire, was found.
But a childhood friend of Pte James told the hearing she hated the Army and had not wanted to return after her last visit home.
"She just wanted to go Awol," Lydia Baksh told the inquest.
Ms Foster read a statement to the court, made in 2002 by the police officer who reviewed Pte James's death.
She said: "There was no exit wound, the apparent lack of blood on the ground, the way in which the hood of [her] waterproof jacket was covering the face... any one of these indicators would not cause suspicion... but taken together, they ask questions about the way and the manner of Private James's death."
Des James, the soldier's father, told the inquest this evidence confirmed suspicions he and his wife had at the time.
"We were never informed about this and given all the complaints and challenges we made, Surrey Police had many opportunities," he said.
The coroner was also told there was concern about the "thoroughness of the inquiries" made by Surrey Police about an "unknown male" who was seen around the time of Pte James's death.

"Surrey Police came to my home to review the case. They told me about what [the private] said, that she was going off into the woods and she said she was going to be fine," he said.
"You can't just be laughing and joking one minute, then go into the woods and [commit suicide]."
Mr James said he felt his daughter had been involved in an argument before she died.
The court was told there were three potential suspects around the time Pte James died, including two "unknown males".
Ms Baksh said her school friend was happy and bubbly, but revealed she had come to hate life in the Army.
"All I can recall is that she was reprimanded a lot," she said.
"The last time she came home she was quite tearful. She just hated the Army, she didn't want to go back in."
Ms Baksh said Pte James had said she had been raped aged 13 or 14 after meeting boys at a party.
"She didn't speak about it much, but after that it really affected her," Ms Baksh told the coroner's court in Woking.
She was also asked about an incident of self-harming by Pte James.
Ms Baksh said: "I can't remember what she did on her arm. It was nothing serious... I guess she was just trying to deal with what she's trying to go through, in a way.
"It was definitely after the rape occurred but it wasn't with the intent to kill herself."
John Beggs QC, representing Surrey Police, asked her about a statement she made when she found out about Pte James's death.
"I was extremely upset, but not in the least bit surprised," Miss Baksh said.
She told the hearing at the time of her friend's death she thought she had killed herself.
"However, now, I wouldn't say I felt certain," she said.
