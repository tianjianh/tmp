[SN]TITLE[SN]
Exeter City 1-3 Doncaster Rovers

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Liam Mandeville came off the bench in the second half to to score one goal and create two for John Marquis as Doncaster Rovers fought back to beat Exeter City.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Mandeville replaced Niall Mason after 69 minute and levelled for Doncaster three minutes later after Exeter had taken the lead through Reuben Reid's penalty.
Reid smashed the ball home after David Wheeler had been brought down by goalkeeper Marko Mariso inside the penalty box.
The lead lasted until the 72nd minute when Mandeville met a James Coppinger cross to head in off the underside of the crossbar as Exeter seemingly froze after going in front.
Reid then had a shot well saved by Mariso, but Doncaster went in front on 78 minutes when a low cross from Mandeville was turned in by John Marquis from six yards.
And Mandeville turned provider again in the 90th minute when he slipped the ball to Marquis, who again beat Exeter goalkeeper James Hamon.
The win sees Darren Ferguson's side go third in the table, while Exeter are yet to win at home this season as the pressure on manager Paul Tisdale continues to grow.
