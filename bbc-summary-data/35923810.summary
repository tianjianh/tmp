Wolf Hall, based on the novel by Hilary Mantel, picked up four nominations for the awards, to be held on 8 May.
The historical drama is nominated in the best drama series category, alongside Humans, The Last Panthers and No Offence.
It has also received nominations for Claire Foy's performance as Anne Boleyn and Anton Lesser's supporting performance as Sir Thomas More.
Foy and Smith are joined in the leading actress category by Suranne Jones and Ruth Madeley, who are nominated for BBC One's Doctor Foster and BBC Three's Don't Take My Baby respectively.
Rylance, who won an Oscar last month for his supporting role in Bridge of Spies, is nominated for his role as Thomas Cromwell, Henry VIII's right hand man.
Doctor Foster, London Spy and This is England '90 are nominated in the best mini-series category, as is Sky production The Enfield Haunting.
The C-Word is up for the single drama prize, alongside BBC One's The Go-Between, Don't Take My Baby and Channel 4's Cyberbully.
Sharon Horgan is up for the best female performance in a comedy programme award, for Channel 4's Catastrophe.
So are Sian Gibson, for Peter Kay's Car Share, Miranda Hart for Miranda, and Michaela Coel for E4's Chewing Gum.
