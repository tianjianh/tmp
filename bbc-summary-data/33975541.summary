'Child gravestones' plaques found at Abergavenny mansion

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A property developer who illegally altered a 16th Century Monmouthshire mansion had wall plaques that appeared to be made from children's gravestones, a court has been told.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Newport Crown Court heard a number of broken grave headstones were found in the garden in 2010.
"Very similar" wall plaques were found inside the house.
Kim Davies has admitted illegally modifying Llanwenarth House in Abergavenny.
The headstones related to three children; David, four, Rosie, three, and Thomas, 11 months.
The house was originally built in 1532 on six-acres (2.4 hectares) of land and has a detached coach house along with an orchard.
Davies bought the mansion in 2007 for Â£675,000 and spent more than Â£1m on it, which included changing the original timber windows to "modern" ones as well as replacing doors and a fireplace.
He stripped the Grade II-listed property without the approval of Brecon Beacons National Park Authority.
The building is said to have inspired the hymn All Things Bright and Beautiful.
Irish poet Cecil Alexander was a guest there in 1848 when she wrote it.
Davies's sentencing continues.
