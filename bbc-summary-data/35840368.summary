The body of 50-year-old antiques specialist Robyn Mercer was found in Walton Road, West Molesey, on Monday.
A post-mortem examination revealed she died from multiple blows to the head.
Surrey Police said two men arrested on suspicion of murder, a 52-year-old on Monday and a man aged 25 on Thursday, had both been bailed until 20 May.
On Thursday, relatives of the mother-of-two said they were "utterly devastated to have lost Robyn" who worked at JH Bourdon-Smith in Mayfair, west London.
Fellow art and antique specialists described her as an "extremely kind-hearted lady".
