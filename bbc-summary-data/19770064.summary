Guernsey Police warns cyclists over lights

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Cyclists are being encouraged to use lights at night in a new scheme being run by Guernsey Police and cycle shops.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Anyone caught riding in the dark by officers will be given an alternative to paying the fixed penalty notice for the offence.
If they get lights fitted at a local cycle shop and give police the certificate confirming the work within 14 days, the fine will be cancelled.
Anyone failing to do either option could be called to appear in court.
A police spokesman said the aim was to improve road safety for cyclists.
The dealerships involved in the scheme are Adventure Cycles, Cycle World, Ian Brown and Millards.
