A stolen Grogg statue of rugby star Sam Warburton has been returned to a pub by a thief with a guilty conscience.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The nine inch (23cm) figure was taken from the Deri Inn, Rhiwbina, Cardiff, but was handed back a week later.
It was left outside with a note saying: "Been on holiday! Didn't want to be alone for Xmas. Come back to be with you lot! Sam X."
Police had launched an investigation after the figure - crafted at Pontypridd's Grogg Shop - disappeared.
The collectable had taken pride of place in the pub that is in the area where Cardiff Blues and 2013 Lions captain, Mr Warburton, grew up.
Duty manager Dan Draper, 24, said: "It was left outside the pub near the front doors in a black bin bag with a note Sellotaped to it.
"We are delighted to have it back."
