UN imposes tough North Korea sanctions

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The United Nations Security Council has unanimously adopted a resolution significantly expanding international sanctions against North Korea.

Correspondents say the new measures amount to some of the toughest against North Korea in two decades.
The vote is in response to North Korea's nuclear test last month.
The sanctions will result in all cargo going to and from the country being inspected, while 16 new individuals and 12 organisations have been blacklisted.
"Today, the international community, speaking with one voice, has sent Pyongyang a simple message: North Korea must abandon these dangerous programmes and choose a better path for its people," US President Barack Obama said in a statement.

How potent are North Korea's threats?
Addressing the council after the vote, US Ambassador to the UN Samantha Power said that it was a "perverse reality" that North Korea was more interested in developing its nuclear and ballistic missile programmes than it was in meeting the basic needs of its people.
The United States and North Korea's long-standing ally China spent seven weeks discussing the new sanctions.
In addition to the mandatory cargo inspections the sanctions also include a ban on all sales or transfers of small arms and light weapons to North Korea, and expulsion of diplomats from the North who engage in "illicit activities".
The US, its Western allies and Japan were eager for the new sanctions to be speedily put in place, and pushed for them to be as wide-ranging as possible.
But China made clear that it did not want to impose measures that could jeopardise the stability of North Korea and cause its economy to collapse.
The UN resolution emphasises that the new sanctions are not intended to lead to "adverse humanitarian consequences" for civilians, many of whom face financial hardships and shortages of food.
North Korea's launch of a long-range rocket in February and a nuclear test in January were widely condemned as a flagrant violation of UN resolutions.
North Korea earlier said it would no longer take part in UN Human Rights Council sessions examining its rights record.
Foreign Minister Ri Su-yong accused the council of "politicisation, selectivity and double standards" and of "singling out" North Korea for criticism.
The UN council has repeatedly criticised North Korea over its treatment of its citizens.
The North insists its missile programme is purely scientific in nature, but the US, South Korea and even its ally China say such rocket launches are aimed at developing inter-continental ballistic missiles.
The North claimed its January nuclear test - the fourth since 2006 - was a test of its hydrogen bomb technology.
