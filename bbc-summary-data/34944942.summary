Seka Ritchie, 32, and Tracey McLean, 29, are accused of killing Alexander Duncan at his home in Leith on 16 April 2015.
It is claimed the 59-year-old was hit with a bottle and stabbed with a knife or similar item.
Prosecutors also allege the pair robbed Mr Duncan of his wallet and its contents.
They also face charges of attempting to defeat the ends of justice and attempting to pervert the course of justice.
Ms Ritchie is further accused of four separate assaults in Edinburgh between 2010-2013.
Lawyers for the pair entered not guilty pleas on Friday during a short hearing at the High Court in Glasgow.
Judge Lord Burns set a trial due to start next June in Edinburgh. The case will last about 10 days.
