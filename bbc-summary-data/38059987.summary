[SN]TITLE[SN]
Dagenham & Redbridge 0-1 Torquay United

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Kieffer Moore scored a late winner as Torquay beat Dagenham, who slipped out of the National League play-off places.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The hosts' Luke Guttridge almost opened the scoring against the side he had represented at youth level, but saw his shot superbly stopped one-handed by Brendan Moore.
In the second half, the hosts remained dominant, and Moore pulled off another lunging save to deny Jordan Maguire-Drew.
Torquay came alive in the latter stages. Moore had a header turned on to the bar by Elliot Justham, but in the 76th minute the same man found space in the box to slot home the winner.
