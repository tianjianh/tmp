Ramsey Commissioners agree courthouse purchase deal

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Ramsey Commissioners have agreed a deal to buy the town's former courthouse, it has announced.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A row broke out in March after the commissioners expressed anger that the "landmark" building was put up for sale by the Isle of Man government.
The organisation said an agreement, which includes a payment of Â£80,000, followed "detailed discussions" with the Department of Home Affairs.
Chairman Andy Cowie said he was "delighted to finally agree terms".
The deal, which it is hoped will be completed by August, will see the commissioners take over the freehold title of the building and grounds, which includes a war memorial and gardens.
The organisation has agreed to grant the department a 25-year lease on the existing police office at Ramsey Town Hall at a "nominal rent".
Home Affairs minister Bill Malarkey said he was delighted there had been a positive outcome.
Mr Cowie said the building, which was built in the early 19th Century, was "recognised as being at the heart of Ramsey".
It has been used as a theatre, police station and post office.
