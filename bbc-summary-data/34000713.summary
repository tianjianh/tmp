[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A prisoner who killed another inmate with a "reckless and stupid" punch to the head has been jailed.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Maidstone Crown Court heard Alastaire Scott, 23, punched Frazer Stent, 28, outside a cell at Rochester Prison when prisoners were allowed free movement.
Mr Stent fell to the ground and was taken to Medway Maritime Hospital, where a CT scan showed he had bleeding on the brain. He died a week later.
Scott was jailed for four years after pleading guilty to manslaughter.
The court was told that 15 minutes before he was attacked on 12 October, Mr Stent was part of a group of men involved in a row with a prisoner who was a close friend of Scott's.
Scott followed him down a corridor, where he punched him.
Kent Police said when he was interviewed, Scott said he did not intend to kill Mr Stent and only attacked him because of the earlier confrontation with his friend.
"Alastaire Scott's decision to punch Frazer Stent was both reckless and stupid and the consequences could not be more tragic," said Det Insp Gavin Moss.
"He gave little thought to the consequences and the impact it would have on his victim."
