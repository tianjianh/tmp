[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A couple who trafficked a 10-year-old girl to the UK and kept her as a servant for almost a decade have had their sentences increased.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Ilyas Ashar, 84, who repeatedly raped the girl at his Salford home, had his sentence extended from 13 years to 15 years by the Court of Appeal.
His wife, Tallat Ashar, 69, had her sentence increased from five years to six years.
The couple were originally sentenced at Manchester Crown Court in October 2013.
Ilyas Ashar was found guilty of 13 counts of rape as well as benefit fraud and trafficking.
Tallat Ashar was convicted of benefit fraud and trafficking.
The Court of Appeal increased the sentences on an application by Solicitor General Oliver Heald QC, who argued that they were unduly lenient.
Greater Manchester Police said the pair claimed thousands of pounds of benefits in the girl's name, while she was made to clean and cook at several houses belonging to the family.
The girl, now in her 20s, was found in the "sparse, cold and damp" cellar in 2009 by trading standards staff investigating allegations of illegal activity.
