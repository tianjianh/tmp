It follows a four day excavation at the bungalow in Bradninch, Devon, in response to "historic intelligence".
It was suggested officers had been searching David and Pauline Williams' former home for the body of a baby.
The couple were jailed in 2015 for subjecting 10 girls and boys to rape, sexual assault and beatings.
A spokesman for Devon and Cornwall Police said the force would not be pursuing any other lines of enquiry relating to the dig investigation.
Det Supt Keith Perkin said: "Following intelligence received, Devon and Cornwall Police undertook excavation work at a property on Cullompton Hill, Bradninch, Cullompton, Devon, this week.
"Following a detailed excavation at the property, nothing of significance was found."
David and Pauline Williams lived near child murderers Fred and Rose West in Gloucester in the 1980s and 90s.
The couple ran the Prince Albert pub where Fred West was a regular.
A postcard from Rose West to the Williams - made public this week - appears to show the two couples were involved a sex ring.
David Williams boasted in court last year of his connections with the Wests.
