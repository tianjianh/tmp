North Wales Police has received more than 40 calls after an artist's impression of a unidentified murder victim was broadcast on Monday.

The image, of a man whose remains were discovered in a forest at Pentrellyncymer in Conwy last November, was revealed on the BBC's Crimewatch programme,
The body is thought to have been in the forest for several years.
Forensic tests showed the man had suffered a serious head injury.
"A number of calls were received into the incident room and we are following up various lines of inquiry including some possible names to try and identify the individual," said Det Supt Iestyn Davies.
"There will be a loved one, friends, family that may recognise this person.
"Once we get the name, we can work on why did this person become a victim, who would be responsible for that and why would they want to have killed him."
The remains were discovered by two brothers camping in the forest ahead of the Wales Rally GB.
Police launched a large scale forensic search and were able to recover virtually an entire male skeleton.
Mr Davies said the man was probably in his sixties when he died and was between 5ft 8in and 5ft 10.5in (1.73-1.78m) tall.
His nose had been fractured at some point and he suffered from arthritis.
He also had an issue with his spine which would have caused "limited mobility".
"I think he was killed elsewhere," added Mr Davies. "It is our belief that the body would have been deposited in that location some time between 1995 and 2005.
"We have a full DNA profile of the victim but unfortunately it does not match anyone on the national database."
The new, detailed image of what the victim may have looked like was produced with the help a forensic artist and an odontologist.
