[SN]TITLE[SN]
Fleetwood Town 2-0 Oxford United

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Two second-half goals were the difference as Fleetwood recorded their first win of the League One season at home to Oxford.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
David Ball and Ashley Hunter grabbed the goals to give the hosts the three points with a 2-0 success.
Ten minutes in, Chris Long, signed on loan from Burnley last week, showed impressive skill down the left-hand side, crossing for Devante Cole who could not quite direct his header on target.
The best chance of the half also fell to Fleetwood after 25 minutes, with Oxford goalkeeper Simon Eastwood having to be quick off his line to close down Long before Cole hit the rebound over the bar.
Oxford's best chance of the half came just before half-time, with Liam Sercombe hitting the side-netting after good work down the left.
However, four minutes into the second half, Ball struck for Fleetwood. Picking the ball up just on the edge of the box, he curled a perfectly-placed shot past the outstretched arm of Eastwood and into the top corner.
With 20 minutes to go, substitute Hunter made sure of the victory, running into the box and hitting across the goalkeeper into the bottom corner.
