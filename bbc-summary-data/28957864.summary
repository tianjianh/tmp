James Dasaolu (10.06) was third behind Jamaica's Kemar Bailey-Cole (9.96) and Michael Rodgers (10.05) in the 100m.
Dasaolu's training partner and fellow Briton Adam Gemili (10.13) was fifth.
Former world record holder Asafa Powell and ex-world champion Tyson Gay, both of whom returned from drugs bans this summer, finished fourth and ninth respectively in a high-quality field.
Jamaica's 2013 world bronze medallist Nesta Carter was sixth and Britain's Harry Aikines-Aryeetey (10.31) eighth.
"In lane one you have to run your own race and today was about mixing it with the best sprinters in the world," European 100m champion Dasaolu told BBC Sport.

"Coming off the back of two championships, it's hard, but it's nice to get among these guys and beat someone like Nesta Carter," said Gemili, who won 200m European gold and 100m Commonwealth silver behind Bailey-Cole.
Chijindu Ujah, who ran 9.96 early in the season only to miss out on 100m selection for the Commonwealths and the Europeans, claimed a morale-boosting victory in the B race in 10.16.
Nelson, the individual European bronze medallist, was sixth in 11.20 in a women's 100m won by Jamaica's Veronica Campbell-Brown in a photo finish from Ivorian Murielle Ahoure as both finished in 11.04.
World record holder and Olympic gold medallist David Rudisha could only finish third in the 800m, finishing behind Botswana's Nijel Amos and Ayanleh Souleiman of Djibouti.

Amos, who beat Rudisha to Commonwealth gold last month, won in one minute 43.77 seconds.
Souleiman finished in 1:43.93, edging out Rudisha on the line by three hundredths of a second.
"It has been a tough season for me," Rudisha told BBC Sport. "My preparation wasn't perfect this year because I was carrying over an injury from last year. But I'm looking forward to next year."
World champion LaShawn Merritt comfortably won the 400m in 44.36, beating fellow American Gil Roberts (44.96). Britain's Martyn Rooney came fourth in 45.10.
Dawn Harper-Nelson of the United States beat Olympic champion Sally Pearson and Britain's European champion Tiffany Porter in the women's 100m hurdles.
