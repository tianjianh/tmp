A County Donegal postman who is as famous for predicting the weather as he is for delivering mail, is hanging up his postbag after almost 50 years of service.

However Michael Gallagher certainly won't be giving up his amateur status as an enthusiastic weather forecaster.
Now that he is retiring from the day job, he is looking forward to even more time spent researching his favourite hobby.
Mr Gallagher, 67, first got the weather forecasting bug when he started delivering letters in 1967 on his second hand bicycle - which incidentally he bought for three pounds and seven shillings.
He picked up many tips and skills from the older generation of people he met on his rounds - people who don't depend on satellites and complicated charts to predict an impending storm.
A keen eye on nature and how animals are reacting to what's in the air, is the key to what's coming up weather-wise, Mr Gallagher said.
"Nature and animals are very knowledgeable, they know what's going to happen with the weather.
"They have an instinct which we as human beings don't have.
"When good weather is coming, sheep and cattle always go up to the higher ground.
"If the weather is about to change, they'll come back down to the lower ground," he added.
Michael grew up along with his brother, Dave, on a small farm in the town of Ardlaghan.
"Down the years the older generations were always there or there about right when it came to the weather, so I noted a lot of things from them, and then took it up myself," he said.
"I was always very interested in nature and a way of life that didn't depend on television and radio for a weather forecast."
Mr Gallagher explained that he kept his eyes out for weather signs while driving his post van.
"In springtime when the sheep are coming into lambing, if you see them running and jumping about, that's a sign of a very bad storm coming.
"Studying the movements of the cattle is a good guide," he said, with animals seeking shelter being a sign of poor weather on the way.
"The cattle heading for the byres, that's a very bad sign - the good sign is when you see them coming over the mountains and going out to graze on the mountains, the pastures, that's a good sign.
"And the stork, he's a reliable animal, because when he goes up the river and starts dipping and diving, that's a very bad sign."
But it's not just farm animals and wildlife that Mr Gallagher keeps an eye on.
"You have to watch the heather coming up, if it comes up a wee bit early that's bad, but this year it started to come up nicely, at the right time," he said.
"And if a new moon comes in on a Saturday or a Sunday, be very wary of that, the month's going to be very broken," he added.
Mr Gallagher said he thought his methods were more reliable than those of professional meteorologists.
"Those forecasts are the science and the research, but I prefer to stick to my own wee corner in Donegal," he said.
