[SN]TITLE[SN]
Man guilty of killing former Mr Scotland Michael O'Hanlon

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man has been found guilty of stabbing to death a former Mr Scotland bodybuilding champion.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Steven Kirkwood was originally charged with murder but was convicted of the lesser charge of culpable homicide with provocation over the death of Michael O'Hanlon.
Kirkwood claimed he acted in self defence when he stabbed Mr O'Hanlon at Stevenston, North Ayrshire, last July.
The court heard there was a struggle and Mr O'Hanlon was stabbed four times.
The trial, at the High Court in Glasgow, heard that the men had exchanged abusive texts in the days running up to the incident.
Mr O'Hanlon, who was 6ft and weighed 17st 3lbs, had been crowned Mr Scotland by the National Amateur Body Builders' Association four months before his death.
