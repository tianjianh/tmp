Around 9,000 people were killed, and more than 8 million affected by the earthquake - roughly a quarter of the country's population
It also caused massive damage to roads and buildings, with schools closed and people left homeless.
But as time passes things are slowly starting to return to normal, and aid organisations like World Vision are helping people get their lives back on track.
