The American, 33, beat Spain's Garbine Muguruza 6-4 6-4 at Wimbledon to take possession of all four major titles.
It gave her the second 'Serena Slam' of her career, but she can break new ground in New York next month.
"I feel like if I can do the 'Serena Slam', I will be OK heading into the Grand Slam," said Williams.
"Like I always say, there's 127 other people that don't want to see me win. Nothing personal, they just want to win.
"I had a really tough draw [at Wimbledon]. This gives me confidence that if I had this draw, I can do it again. I'll just do the best I can.

"I really don't feel like I have anything to lose. I've kind of solidified my place at number one. My goal is always to end the year at number one."
Williams has now won 21 Grand Slam titles, one short of the open era record set by Steffi Graf who was the only other woman to complete the calendar Slam in 1988.
The American, who has won the US Open for the last three years running, was in little doubt about the scale of the achievement that is now within her sights at Flushing Meadows.
"It's really, really huge," said Williams. "But I haven't done it. I have the 'Serena Slam' now, which is amazing.
"But it's different to actually have something and then try to accomplish it."
Williams will turn 34 next month and Saturday's victory made her the oldest Grand Slam winner in the open era, although Roger Federer would surpass her if he wins Sunday's men's singles final.
"I feel great," said Williams. "I definitely don't feel old. I think in life I'm still pretty young.
"With new technology, new workouts, all this other stuff, I think the life of an athlete is changing and the longevity is becoming longer."
Muguruza, 21, received a huge ovation from the Centre Court crowd after fighting back in the second set.
"I couldn't stop crying," said the Spaniard. "So many people are clapping. I don't know, I make all these people feel this in a tennis court? I felt special."
Asked what the final had told her about Williams, Muguruza added: "I learned that she's also nervous, even though she played I don't know how many finals.
"And she finds the way, being so nervous, to serve, to hit winners. She's world number one. That's what I saw today. I see it every day."
