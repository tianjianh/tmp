The eight plaques mark key locations in the life of the entertainer, who was believed to be the highest paid actress in the world in the 1930s.
Her travelling performances for troops during World War Two led her to become known as "the forces' sweetheart".
A statue in her honour is due to be unveiled on 18 September.
The locations of the plaques include St Chad's Church where she was christened and Rochdale Town Hall, where she received the Freedom of the Borough in 1937.
Richard Farnell, leader of Rochdale Borough Council, said: "Gracie Fields rose from humble beginnings to become an international superstar on the back of sheer talent and hard work.
"It's hard to underestimate the impact she had and it's about time she was properly recognised in her home town."
He added: "This is our chance to show the world how proud we are of her."
The statue of the star, designed by sculptor Sean Hedges Quinn, will be unveiled outside Rochdale Town Hall at 13:00 on 18 September.
