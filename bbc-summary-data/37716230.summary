Rebecca Pick, 23, developed the Personal Guardian following an attack on a neighbour.
It features a wearable monitored alarm which uses smartphone technology to provide the police with information on a user's exact location.
The device aims to improve safety for people such as lone workers.
It can be attached to a belt, lanyard or clothing and, once activated, will send a text containing a user's location to pre-determined phone contacts.
Ms Pick founded her company Pick Protection in 2014. Having attracted £60,000 of investment from an angel investment syndicate last year, the firm has just secured a further £744,000.
The investment is led by Equity Gap Angel Investment Syndicate. Other backers include the University of Strathclyde, Gabriel Investment Syndicate, Scottish Investment Bank and Unipart Group.
The Personal Guardian is expected to be launched in the UK in early 2017. It will be manufactured in Scotland and retail at £120 per device, including the first 12 months' monitoring service.
John Neill, chairman and chief executive at Unipart Group, said: "Unipart is delighted to be supporting a young entrepreneur like Rebecca with the passion and drive to make a difference."
