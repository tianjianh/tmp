The 33-year-old fly-half, who is the brother of Northampton Saints duo Ken and George Pisi, has 28 caps for Samoa.
He will join the Championship leaders from Japan's first Super Rugby franchise Sunwolves, founded in 2015.
"Tusi's experience will be beneficial for our younger players and he remains as hungry and motivated as ever," director of rugby Andy Robinson said.
Bristol are 13 points clear at the top of the table with three matches of the regular season remaining.
