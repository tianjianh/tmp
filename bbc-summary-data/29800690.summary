Robbie Williams says he's never been "more in love" and "proud" of his wife after she gave birth to their second child.

The baby boy hasn't been named yet, but in a video posted after the birth, the 40-year-old called it an "emotional and amazing" day.
The singer live vlogged the labour in a series of videos described as "bizarre" on social media.
In one, he "helps Ayda relax" by miming his 2012 solo single Candy.
Others show him singing songs from the Frozen soundtrack, talking about his choice of pants and asking the doctor if the birth would mess up his robe.
Many on social media are unimpressed:
But Ayda also got in on the act.
In one video called You'll Never Walk Alone she's seen "helping" Robbie walk down the corridor with a drip.
She twerks for her husband in another, then at 3.20pm, the happy couple announced "he's here".
Some have seen a funny side and many have congratulated the couple:
In the final video of the pair Robbie called his wife "absolutely astonishing".
He added: "The universe has presented itself to us again and it's been a very emotional, amazing few hours and we're really happy and honoured that you experienced the journey with us".
