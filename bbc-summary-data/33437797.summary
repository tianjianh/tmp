Greece debt crisis: Eurozone sets out new deadline

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The eurozone gives Greece until Thursday to present new proposals to secure a deal with creditors, and has called a full EU summit for Sunday.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The moves came after an emergency eurozone leaders' summit in Brussels.
The eurozone had asked Greece to submit fresh plans after its voters rejected a draft bailout in a referendum.
But Greece brought no written plans, suggesting instead a few changes to an earlier draft, which would respect "the mandate of the referendum".
On Sunday a meeting of all 28 members of the European Union will be held.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel said the eurozone leaders had a "serious, candid discussion" in Brussels that "reflected the seriousness of the situation at hand".
She said the leaders "obviously respect the results of the referendum" but also had a "shared responsibility" for the European Union.
Italian PM Matteo Renzi said Greek PM Alexis Tsipras was acting in good faith to provide sensible proposals to stave off the debt crisis.
