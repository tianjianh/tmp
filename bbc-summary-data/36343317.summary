Hibernian can redeem a disappointing season with Scottish Cup final victory over Rangers, says captain David Gray.

The Easter Road side are recovering from last week's painful play-off semi-final defeat by Falkirk.
And Gray was on the losing side in the League Cup final in March.
"If we could manage to secure the Scottish Cup, it would at least give the fans something that they have not had for a long, long time and it would end the season on a high," said Gray.
"Our aim was to get promoted, we are not hiding from that fact. We made that clear all season.
"So not to do that was very disappointing."
Hibs lost to Falkirk 5-4 on aggregate, with a Bob McHugh goal in stoppage time consigning the Edinburgh club to a third season in the Championship.
"I know the feeling I had on Friday night and it is not a feeling I can even contemplate having again," said the 28-year-old.
"Dealing with the disappointments on Friday, waking up with it on Saturday and having to think about that happening again is something I never want to do at all.
"It was quickly about getting it to the back of my mind and focusing on what could possibly be a great weekend ahead."
Hibs also conceded a last-gasp goal in their 2-1 defeat by Ross County in the Scottish League Cup final.
"It was the same sort of feeling, dealing with the disappointment of that," recalled right-back Gray.
"Watching someone else go up and lift the trophy was a massive disappointment for me and the players were all hurting after that as well.
"It would have been worse if we had not turned up, but I thought we played well and were maybe just a little bit unlucky on the day.
"But we didn't win, so we need to make sure that we can try to put it right this weekend."
Hibs, in their third final in five seasons, have been Scottish Cup runners-up on 11 occasions and have not lifted the trophy since 1902.
"To get rid of that monkey on everyone's back would be a great achievement as a whole squad and everyone involved at the club," added Gray.
