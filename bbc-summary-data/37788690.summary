Constable Claire Lowe, 39, died on Wednesday on the Moss Road near Ballygowan.
She is believed to have been riding with a local hunt.
The incident has been described as a "freak hunting accident", although the cause of death has not yet been confirmed.
Lisburn and Castlereagh City District Commander Supt Sean Wright paid tribute to an experienced and professional police officer with six years' service, who "was in the prime of her life".
"We all knew of her love for horses and for her sport but we also knew her for being a committed police officer who found challenge and reward in serving the local community and in keeping people safe," he said.
"She will be very much missed by all of us and her loss will be deeply felt for a long time to come.
"Our thoughts are with Claire's family and friends at this tragic and difficult time," he added.
