Laura Robson and Aljaz Bedene both suffer losses in second round

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Britain's Laura Robson lost in three sets to American Ellie Halbauer in the second round of the Granby National Bank Challenger tournament in Canada.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Having won her first match singles in almost two years in the opening round, the world number 913 lost 6-2 4-6 6-2 to the world number 498.
The 21-year-old returned from a wrist injury in June after 18 months out.
Meanwhile, British number two Aljaz Bedene lost 6-4 6-4 to Borna Coric in the second round of the Croatia Open.
Robson, who was 27 in the world in 2013, will play in the US Open next month thanks to a protected ranking.
She is able to do so as players are allowed to enter eight tournaments based on the ranking they had before a long-term injury lay off.
