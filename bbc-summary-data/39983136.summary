The 22-year-old Evans was red carded by referee Marius Mitrea for a first-half tip tackle in their Pro12 semi-final win in Dublin.
Such tackles can lead to bans of between four and 12 weeks.
Evans was named for Wales' June tour for Tests against Tonga and Samoa after being an uncapped member of their 2017 Six Nations squad.
The incident that led to his sending off came after Evans had scored a try that helped the visitors lead 21-10 at the break against Leinster.

Wales face Tonga in Auckland on Friday, 16 June before taking on Samoa in Apia a week later.
Scarlets boss Wayne Pivac hopes Evans will be cleared to make the trip.
Pivac said: "There was absolutely no intent. The guy's got a clean sheet .
"He's a fantastic rugby player and I'd like to think that going into a semi-final before half time, 14 down, that it's probably punishment enough."
