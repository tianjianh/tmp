Chris Creveling: US speed skater accepts four-year doping ban

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Olympic silver medal-winning speed skater Chris Creveling has been banned for four years after testing positive for testosterone-booster clomiphene.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 30-year-old American, who won 5,000m relay silver at Sochi 2014, will miss the 2018 Games in Pyeongchang.
He has accepted the US Anti-Doping Agency's sanction, which is effective from 18 November 2016, the date of his provisional suspension.
Traces of clomiphene were found in an out-of-competition test in October.
Clomiphene was initially developed as a fertility drug but has performance-enhancing qualities as it boosts levels of testosterone.
