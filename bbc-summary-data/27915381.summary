HMS Tireless navy submarine ends service at Devonport

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Royal Navy's oldest nuclear submarine, HMS Tireless, has been taken out of service.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Launched in 1984, the hunter-killer class sub returned to its Devonport base in Plymouth for the last time on 1 June, after 30 years in service.
A decommissioning ceremony was held at Devonport earlier.
One of the submarine's last duties was helping the search for Malaysian Airlines flight MH370 in April.
Commanding Officer, Cdr Hywel Griffiths said: "Although it is sad to consign her to history, Tireless has achieved much in her nearly 30 year career.
Our recent involvement in the search for Malaysian Flight MH370 is testament to her valued contribution right up until the end of her distinguished service at the frontline of naval operations.
"She gives way now to the modern and world-beating capability represented by the Astute Class and will be replaced by HMS Artful."
In 2007 two sailors died in an explosion on board Tireless during an exercise under the Arctic ice cap.
Failed air-purification equipment was thought to have caused the explosion.
In 2013 she returned to Plymouth after a leak in her nuclear reactor.
HMS Tireless joins 11 other former navy nuclear submarines which are waiting to be dismantled at Devonport while the government searches for a site to dispose of their radioactive reactors.
