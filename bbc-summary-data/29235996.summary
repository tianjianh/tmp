The British 22-year-old, who has become a fixture on catwalks around the world, will play the pivotal role of Margo Roth Spiegelman.
US novelist Green told his 3.1 milllion followers on Twitter that Delevingne's audition "blew everyone away".
"She understands Margo profoundly," he wrote. "I am so excited!"
Delevingne's role follows appearances in Joe Wright's upcoming Peter Pan film Pan and two other novel adaptations, Tulip Fever and London Fields, that have yet to be released.
She was also seen at the Toronto Film Festival in Michael Winterbottom's The Face of an Angel,  a drama inspired by the murder of British student Meredith Kercher.
The screenplay for Paper Towns is currently being written by Scott Neustadter and Michael H Weber, who also adapted The Fault in Our Stars.
Actor Nat Wolff, who had a supporting role in that teen romance, will co-star with Delevingne as Spiegelman's friend, Quentin Jacobsen.
His character follows a series of clues after Margo disappears, having being recruited by her to wreak revenge on her enemies.
Delevingne, who was recently seen modelling at London Fashion Week, also reacted to the news on Twitter, saying she too was "so excited".
Delevingne has reportedly been a less regular fixture on catwalks in recent months, leading to speculation she is preparing to devote more time to her burgeoning film career.
