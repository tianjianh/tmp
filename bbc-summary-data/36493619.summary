[SN]TITLE[SN]
Hillwalkers urged use maps and not just GPS

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
People planning walks in Scotland's hills are being asked not to rely solely on GPS devices but rather use them in addition to map reading skills.

The Mountaineering Council of Scotland said the technology can accurately compute direct routes from one point to another but not the terrain in between.
The organisation is not discouraging the use of GPS.
However, it said people should be able to interpret a map whether it was in paper or digital format.
Map reading skills were essential in poor visibility where the terrain was difficult, said the MCofS.
It has also warned that walkers in certain areas next month may even find their GPS has been jammed.
Services are to be denied in and around the Hebrides during military training.
Communications watchdog Ofcom has issued a notification about GPS jamming planned for periods of time between 1-29 July while aircraft crews train over a military range on Benbecula.
Denial of GPS in the Western Isles and other parts of Scotland for military exercises is not unusual, but the Mountaineering Council of Scotland (MCofS) has described it as a timely reminder of reasons why hillwalkers should not rely only on GPS.
The council said technology was a useful addition to map reading skills.
