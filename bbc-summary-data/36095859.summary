Manitoba New Democrats (NDP) had been in power since 1999 and a Conservative takeover in the province has not happened in more than a decade.
Brian Pallister will become the province's premier, ousting the New Democrats' Greg Selinger.
The Manitoba results are the latest in a string of setbacks for the NDP.
National NDP leader Thomas Muclair was recently voted out by the party.
The party is attempting to re-identify itself after huge losses to the Liberals in the 2015 federal election.
"Thank you, Manitoba! We will not let you down," the Progressive Conservative party of Manitoba posted to its Twitter and Facebook pages after the election.
The party won 40 of 57 seats while the NDP suffered losses across the province, according to the CBC.
"The only thing better than tonight in Manitoba is tomorrow," the 61-year-old Mr Pallister, who became leader of the Manitoba Progressive Conservatives in 2012, said during his victory speech in Manitoba.
"And tomorrow, all Manitobans are going to walk out into a beautiful spring morning. They're going to look up and the sky's going to be blue."
During his campaign, he pledged to lower taxes and improve Manitoba's finances. Its credit rating was downgraded last year after not meeting balanced budget targets, the CBC reports.
Mr Selinger resigned as leader of the Manitoba NDP on Tuesday night following the party's loss.
"In a democracy, friends, the people are always right, the collective wisdom of Manitobans has to be respected," he said. "Tonight as we examine the results... I have offered my resignation."
