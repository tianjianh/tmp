GB made it four wins in a row at the World Championship (Division 1B) in Zagreb and will face Ukraine in a promotion decider on Saturday.
"It sets up a massive gold-medal match - it's a game we've been building towards all week," said GB head coach Pete Russell.
"It's exciting and we will now focus our attentions on Ukraine."
For the second day in succession, GB's Welsh captain Jonathan Phillips opened the scoring, with Jonathan Boxill adding a second before the end of the first period.
There were powerplay goals in the second period for Robert Farmer and Colin Shields as GB dominated.
Matthew Myers and Jonathan Weaver also scored, before Ervin Moldovan replied for Romania four minutes from time.
"We did well out there," added Russell. "It wasn't pretty but we did what we had to do.
"This was a game we were expected to win and they went out and did that.
"They are such a focused bunch of guys and nothing seems to put them off their stride."
Ice hockey commentator Seth Bennett
"Great Britain are now one win away from becoming the first team since 1993 to win a gold medal at a World Championships and promotion.
"Since then, GB have finished with silver medals four times, including last year when they only needed a point against Lithuania but lost 3-2.
"The hurt from that defeat remains with this squad and they are determined to go one better against a good Ukraine team, who are the top seeds in the tournament.
"For head coach Russell, this is a chance to lead Great Britain back to world ice hockey's second tier and it would be a huge feather in the cap of a young British coach."
