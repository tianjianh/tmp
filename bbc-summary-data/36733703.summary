A bus has come off its guided tracks in Cambridge and mounted a grass verge.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
There were no passengers on board the single decker and the driver was not injured in the incident, which took place shortly after 07:30 BST.
The scene on the Guided Busway on Hauxton Road, Trumpington, is not far from a section where another bus derailed earlier this year.
The bus is being recovered from the verge of the busway which was opened in 2011 at a cost of Â£181m.
Services are currently diverted between Trumpington and Addenbrookes.
Andy Campbell Stagecoach East Managing Director said: "As well as carrying out our own investigation, and accessing on-board CCTV footage, we will work with the police and other relevant bodies to establish the cause of this incident as quickly as possible."
In February, Stagecoach dismissed a driver who derailed a bus after driving too fast and crashing, injuring five passengers.
