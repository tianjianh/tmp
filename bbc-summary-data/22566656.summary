A police watchdog has asked North Yorkshire Police for information about contact officers had with Jimmy Savile.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) said it was acting "in light of information received" and had asked the force to review "all relevant material".
Savile had a home in Scarborough, where he regularly spent time.
The watchdog said it wanted to know whether there were "conduct matters that should be referred to us".
A spokesman for the force said: "North Yorkshire Police is assisting the IPCC with the request."
An IPCC spokesman said: "In the light of information received, the IPCC is writing to North Yorkshire Police to ask them to review all relevant material and information to establish whether there are conduct matters that should be referred to us.
"The IPCC has received the recently published report from West Yorkshire Police arising from the Savile case.
"The IPCC has received an earlier referral from the force in relation to the alleged actions of a former West Yorkshire police inspector which is being assessed.
"The IPCC is collating responses from a number of forces we have written to asking them to review all relevant material and information to establish whether there are conduct matters that should be referred to us."
