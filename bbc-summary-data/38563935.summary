Fraser Balmain and Val Rapava Ruskin: Gloucester sign props for next season

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Gloucester have agreed deals with Leicester Tigers prop Fraser Balmain and Worcester Warriors prop Val Rapava Ruskin.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Balmain, 25 and Rapava Ruskin, 24, will both join the Cherry and Whites for the 2017-18 season.
Tight-head Balmain has agreed a move to Kingsholm following a six-year stint at Welford Road.
Georgia-born loose-head Rapava Ruskin, who has lived in England since the age of two, joined Warriors in 2014.
They join back row Carl Fearns, who has agreed a move from Lyon, in committing to Premiership club Gloucester for next season.
"It's a big disappointment to lose Val," Worcester coach Carl Hogg told BBC Hereford & Worcester. "But players sometimes see their futures elsewhere. That's life.
"He came to us in 2014 having been in and around two or three clubs and he's developed into a very good Premiership player. He's got the ability to play for England.
"Mefin Davies on our coaching team has done wonderful work with him over the last two and a half years and huge credit should go to him."
