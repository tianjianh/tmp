England have come a long way since last year's World Cup but still have plenty to learn, says coach Trevor Bayliss.

His side are poised at 2-2 heading into the final one-day international against South Africa in Cape Town on Sunday.
Bayliss has seen improvements in the past 12 months, especially in his side's batting ranks, with wins against New Zealand and Pakistan.
"They are playing some extremely good cricket, it's a real good feel among the group at the moment," he said.
"It gives them confidence to go out and play their natural games. We've seen that with the batting, with a number of scores over 300, and the bowling is always improving.
"We've got a fair way to go, a number of things to learn, probably more so from the bowling than the batting, but things are exciting - that's good news for the cricket fans."
Bayliss says the chance to blood younger, less experienced players in ODI series will benefit England come the next World Cup in 2019.
"We're learning more and more about the players all the time," added the 53-year-old. "Hopefully in the next series or two we'll be a lot closer to realising what our top 15 to 20 are.
"The players in the team are naturally attacking-style players and if that comes off more times than not, well then the team's going to score more runs and take a lot of wickets.
"Yes, we've got to be more consistent, but I think that will come with more experience these young players get over the next year or two."
And Bayliss has challenged his bowlers to improve away from home.
"They're used to the lines and lengths they need to bowl at home," added the Australian. "But the experience they'll get away from home will hopefully stand them in good stead going forward."
