[SN]TITLE[SN]
Bradford City 0-0 Port Vale

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Neither Bradford City nor Port Vale could hand their new manager a victory on the first day of the League One season in a goalless draw played out in front of a bumper 18,558 crowd at Valley Parade.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
But Bradford's Stuart McCall will have more positives to take from his side's performance than opposite number Bruno Ribeiro as the home side dominated large chunks of the match without being able to supply a finishing touch to their attractive football.
The nearest City came to scoring was in the 12th minute when Billy Clarke saw his shot diverted on to the crossbar by goalkeeper Jak Alnwick.
Twice striker James Hanson just failed to connect with inviting crosses while Clarke again and new signings Nicky Law and Romain Vincelot also went close to breaking the deadlock.
Vale, who included five new signings in their starting line-up, rarely threatened the Bradford goal but almost snatched victory in the last minute of normal time when substitute Christopher Mbamba scuffed his shot with the goal at his mercy from Paulo Tavares' cross.
