[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Eugene Carr, 73, died in the Royal Victoria Hospital on Tuesday night.
A post-mortem is to be carried out, but police said it is believed he died of his injuries.
Mr Carr was attacked at his home at Clogharevan Park, Bessbrook, in the early hours of 31 August.
Police said three men broke into the house and went into the bedroom where the pensioner was in bed.
They stabbed him and beat him before stealing cash.
Mr Carr was taken to Daisy Hill Hospital in Newry before being transferred to the Royal Victoria Hospital in Belfast where he died on Tuesday.
Chief Inspector Lee McNevison said Mr Carr had been the victim of an "horrendous attack whilst he was in his bed at his home".
A 25-year-old woman and a 26-year-old man arrested in the Newry area on 4 September in relation to the attack were later released on police bail pending further enquiries.
Sinn FÃ©in councillor Roisin Mulgrew said: "We now know that Eugene Carr has lost his fight to live and unfortunately is dead, so that will be treated with a lot of shock and disappointment and sadness by the whole Bessbrook community.
"Eugene was a very well-liked and gentle person."
