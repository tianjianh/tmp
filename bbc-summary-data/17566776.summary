A new head teacher has been appointed at Guernsey's La Mare de Carteret High School, the Education Department has announced.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Vicky Godley, who started at the school in September as deputy head teacher, will start in the role on 16 April.
Geoff Cowley, acting head teacher, will return to his role as School Improvement Partner.
The school was heavily criticised in its latest validation report and for poor GCSE results last year.
Alan Brown, deputy director of education, said: "We are confident that Vicky is the right candidate to lead the school as it continues to improve.
"She has the support of the staff, pupils and parents of the school and is having a positive impact through her work with the rest of the senior leadership team."
