The 32-year-old Australian returned to the club for a second spell in February 2015 and has scored 19 goals since.
Hibernian were among the clubs interested in the former Celtic and Middlesbrough forward.
"There were a couple of serious offers on the table for me, but I always had it in my mind that Motherwell was a club where I love being," he said.
McDonald scored 47 goals in his first period at Motherwell, from January 2004 to July 2007 before his switch to Celtic.
"Scotty is one of the best players in the country, so we're naturally delighted he has chosen Motherwell over the other options he had," manager Mark McGhee told the club website.
"We can't compete with some of the bigger sides in Scotland for cash, but Motherwell is a special club that draws people to it, particularly those who have been here for a period of time. It's a welcoming, family environment that both players and staff enjoy.
"We have real competition in the goalkeeping, defensive and forward areas now. We are working hard on central midfield targets and hope to announce some new additions soon."
