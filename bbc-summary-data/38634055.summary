The blast, which happened in Cecil Road, Blackley, at about 12:40 GMT, reduced much of the end terrace property to rubble and badly damaged the home next door.
A man with "major trauma" injuries was taken to Salford Royal Hospital and another person was taken to Wythenshawe hospital.
Three people were treated at the scene.
The precise cause of the blast is not yet known but was being treated as gas-related, Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue said.
A "small number" of people living in nearby homes were advised to temporarily leave the area, a spokesman said.

Crews used sniffer dogs to assess the scene and make sure no one was trapped.
Zoe Spencer, who lives nearby and was at home when the blast occurred, said: "I had my headphones on listening to music and all of a sudden there was just a humungous bang, like someone smashing the windows.
"You just wondered, what was that?"
Incident commander Merl Forrer said: "We are currently shoring up the property and using dogs to search the scene to ensure nobody is trapped inside.
"The building is partially collapsed and we are working to determine a cause."
