The 25-year-old moved to Spotland in June 2013 and scored twice in 24 appearances during the 2015-16 season.
Eastham came through the youth system at Blackpool and had loan spells at numerous clubs, including at the Cody Army in 2012 where he featured twice.
"I've had chats with various people and it was a tough decision for me to leave Rochdale," he told the club website.
"I've had three fantastic years there but I needed a new start."
