Gareth Browning, 36 from Thames Valley Police, died on 1 April after suffering catastrophic brain injuries in 2013.
A police helicopter hovered in salute as the funeral cort√®ge was led through a guard of honour at St Mary's Church in Chieveley, Berkshire.
Luke Hayward was jailed in 2014 for causing grievous bodily harm with intent and dangerous driving.
PC Browning's father was among those who gave a reading during the funeral service on Thursday.
The chief constable of Thames Valley Police, Francis Hapgood, also paid tribute.
PC Browning, a father of young twins, was on patrol in Reading in November 2013 when he tried to stop a stolen car driven by Hayward, a prisoner on day release.
But the car hit him at speed and he suffered catastrophic brain injuries, needing constant care.
Thames Valley Police Federation chairman Craig O'Leary said he and his colleagues would "never forget" PC Browning's "dedicated service and sacrifice to the public of Thames Valley".
He added: "The loss of a colleague is never an easy thing to come to terms with and this has had a profound impact on so many people.
"It's at times like this when you see that the strength and togetherness of the police family is stronger than ever.
"We will never forget Gareth and our thoughts remain with his family, friends and close colleagues at this time."
PC Browning's name has been added to a national police memorial in London.
Thames Valley Police and the Crown Prosecution Service are investigating whether further action can be taken against Hayward in light of PC Browning's death.
