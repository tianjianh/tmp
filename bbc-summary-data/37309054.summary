[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Pte Archibald Buchanan Clark, from West Lothian, died at Kumgong in 1951, aged 20, while on National Service.
The Rifleman in the 1st Battalion King's Own Scottish Borderers was killed by enemy gunfire.
Now, 65 years later, he has been honoured with the Elizabeth Cross, which was presented to his brother Roy in a ceremony in Edinburgh on Thursday.
His family said in a statement: "Archie is, and will always be, missed.
"This medal and scroll will be passed down through the family, who will always have a reminder of the sacrifice Archie and all his comrades made."
Edinburgh's Lord Lieutenant Donald Wilson led the ceremony at Edinburgh City Chambers.
He said: "It is an honour to bestow Archie's brother and extended family with a tangible recognition of his bravery.
"The Elizabeth Cross provides a lasting recognition of his national service and the loss felt by those he left behind.
"The contribution of Scottish troops during the Korean War is all too often overlooked, which makes honouring soldiers like Archie and remembering their sacrifice even more important."
