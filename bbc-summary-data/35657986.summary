"Phangiso's action will now be scrutinised further in accordance with the CSA regulations," Cricket South Africa (CSA) said in a statement.
Phangiso, 32, who is in his country's squad for the World Twenty20 in India starting in March, will undergo testing by the International Cricket Council.
South Africa open their campaign on 18 March against England in Mumbai.
Phangiso, who was in South Africa's squad for their recent T20 series win over England, was reported after helping Lions into the final of South Africa's provincial 50-over competition, when he took 2-38 in eight overs.
Phangiso was disciplined by CSA after allegedly offending crew and passengers on a flight from India last October while in an intoxicated state.
He was also forced to apologise after being caught by television cameras imitating snorting cocaine while in his team's dugout during the second T20 international against England in Johannesburg on Sunday.
