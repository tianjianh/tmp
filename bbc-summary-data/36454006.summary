Liam Smith set his sights on Mexico's Saul 'Canelo' Alvarez after defending his WBO light-middleweight title with a second-round knockout of Predrag Radosevic in Liverpool.

The Liverpool fighter felled Radosevic with a left hook to the body and the Montenegrin failed to beat the count.
It was the 13th knockout victory of his career and and extends his unbeaten record to 23 wins and one draw.
"I'd be a liar if I said Canelo doesn't get my stomach going," Smith, 27, said.
Smith is a possible opponent for Alvarez's next fight, expected to be in Las Vegas in September.
"Every time anyone mentions Canelo and Vegas to me, it gives me goose bumps," Smith added.
WBC middleweight champion Alvarez is regarded as one of the world's best pound-for-pound fighters, and defended his title against Britain's Amir Khan last month.
On the undercard at the Echo Arena, Liverpool's Tom Stalker became the new WBO European lightweight champion after unanimously outpointing Antonio Joao Bento of Portugal.
However, Liverpool's Ryan Farrag lost his EBU European bantamweight title after being knocked out in the third round by Karim Guerfi of France.
