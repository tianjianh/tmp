Horse Tarzan makes light work of timber at Newtonmore

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A horse used in logging operations in a fragile wildlife habitat has been hauling timber in woodland at a museum of Highland life.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Tarzan has in the past dragged logs from the Migdale Rock Site of Special Scientific Interest in Ledmore and Migdale Woods in Sutherland.
The horse caused less damage to rare plants than modern forest machinery.
Tarzan has been put to use at the Highland Folk Museum in Newtonmore where woodland is being thinned out.
Trees in a dense plantation of Scots pine have been felled to improve it as a habitat for wildlife including red squirrels.
Meanwhile, Scots pine woods on a nature reserve at the most northerly estuary on Scotland's east coast are to be given greater protection.
Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH) plans to control deer numbers and remove non-native plants at the site at Loch Fleet near Golspie in Sutherland.
SNH said Scots pine trees in the area were in an "unfavourable condition".
Work to remove rhododendron and sycamore, which are both not native to the UK, will start next month.
Loch Fleet National Nature Reserve covers a large tidal basin surrounded by dunes, salt marsh and pine woods.
