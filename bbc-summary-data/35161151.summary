A mother and baby both died after she collapsed at eight months pregnant and never regained consciousness.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Zoe Rimington, 27, suffered abdominal pains and died en route to hospital on 9 December.
Daughter Elsie was delivered by Caesarean section but died the next day after her life support was turned off.
Zoe's father Chris Lawrence, of Clacton, Essex, said: "What should have been the most joyful time of our lives has turned into the worst."
Mrs Rimington, who also had a two-year-old daughter, Evie, had been married to husband Chris for just five months.
"We were all looking forward to the arrival of little Elsie," said Mr Lawrence.
"It's very difficult and we're just doing the best we can by sticking together and supporting each other."
Mrs Rimington, a care worker, had been "normal" at her parents' house when she complained of excruciating abdominal pains.

"From that moment she was drifting in and out of consciousness," her father added.
"Once she got into the ambulance we were asked to leave, so we knew something was going on. We believe she died in our front garden in the ambulance.
"The heart monitor was just a flat line all the way."
On her arrival at hospital, she was rushed into theatre for a Caesarean section.
"We hoped at least Elsie might survive, and she was alive but there was no brain activity and eventually the monitor was turned off," said Mr Lawrence.
"All in all, a tragic thing."
Mrs Rimington's pregnancy was high risk but the family had never imagined something so serious could happen, he added.
"We knew Elsie could be at risk, Zoe was carrying a bit too much fluid. But we didn't expect to lose Zoe."
A crowd-funding site has been set up in order to cover the cost of both funerals and by Tuesday had raised more than Â£4,000.
The family hopes the money will also pay for a memorial.
"We want her to be remembered, she was so young, we don't want her life to just pass away with her," said Mr Lawrence.
"She was a lovely girl, very caring.
"We are all so numb, we can't believe it happened.
"We still expect her to come walking through the door at any moment."
