Vadims Ruskuls killed Pardeep Kaur during a violent sex attack near Harlington Bridge in west London in October.
Her partially-clothed body was found hidden in undergrowth at the site nearly a week after she was reported missing.
Ruskuls, 25, was jailed for life at the Old Bailey with a minimum 30 year term.
He and his mother were thought be sleeping rough beneath the bridge, which crosses the M4, when he killed the 30-year-old hotel housekeeper.
During the trial, jurors were shown CCTV of Ruskuls following his victim as she approached the bridge in Hayes.
They then disappeared from view for 25 minutes before Ruskuls appeared again, dragging Ms Kaur's partially-clothed body.
Judge Richard Marks QC told the defendant: "It is apparent... that the motive of this attack must have been sexual".
He said Ruskuls sexually assaulted Ms Kaur, killed her and then did his "level best" to conceal her body".
"This was a truly shocking and wicked offence of the utmost gravity," he added.
"Anyone who could do what you did must be regarded as extremely dangerous.
"What a dreadful way for Pardeep Kaur, a decent, hard-working young woman, to die."
Judge Marks told Ruskuls he had not shown "one iota of remorse" for his actions and ordered he be deported once he had served his sentence.
Ruskuls was caught after a police constable recognised the figure in CCTV footage as the man he had spoken to the day after Ms Kaur's disappearance.
Following his arrest, Ruskuls' DNA matched samples taken from Ms Kaur's ankle, sock and bra with a probability of "one in a billion".
Jurors were told Ms Kaur had come to live in Britain in 2011 with her husband, Rachpal Singh.
The pair worked six days a week to send money to their five-year-old daughter, who lived with her grandparents in India.
In a victim impact statement, Ms Kaur's husband said: "I wonder why it happened to lovely Pardeep and why Vadims Ruskuls killed her.
"The circumstances of Pardeep's death will always haunt me because [he] has not given an explanation."
