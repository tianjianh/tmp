Viridor selected for £700m waste plan

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Viridor has been selected as preferred bidder for a £700m contract to process household waste for a consortium of Scottish councils.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 25-year contract was awarded by the Clyde Valley Residual Waste Partners.
They include East Dunbartonshire, East Renfrewshire, North Ayrshire, North Lanarkshire and Renfrewshire councils.
The deal will see Viridor process about 190,000 tonnes of residual waste per year, serving a population of more than 845,000 people.
The project follows a review by former NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde chairman Sir John Arbuthnott of the potential for sharing council services across the Clyde Valley.
Under the contract, Viridor will transport waste collected by each council to its primary treatment facility in Bargeddie, North Lanarkshire.
Primary treatment will remove recyclable material from the waste and prepare a refuse-derived fuel, which will be handled by Viridor's planned energy recovery facility in Dunbar.
Jim Smith, depute leader of North Lanarkshire Council, said: "The development is very good news for residents and businesses within the partner council areas as the project will see Viridor investing to deliver community benefits.
"This is an excellent example of shared service which will see an end to domestic waste being dumped in landfill and deliver savings and service improvements.
"Importantly, it will offer best value for money to taxpayers in the five council areas."
