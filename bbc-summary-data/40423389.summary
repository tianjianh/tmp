American superstar Katie Ledecky began these Championships with nine world titles, and will be hoping to add to that tally in the 200m freestyle.
Meanwhile, the retirement of the legendary Michael Phelps means the men's 200m butterfly - an event Phelps dominated - is intriguingly posed. The Hungarian crowd will roar on Laszlo Cseh and Tamas Kenderesi but watch out for South Africa's Chad Le Clos, who won the 200m butterfly at London 2012 but was bitterly disappointed to finish fourth at the 2016 Games in Rio.
