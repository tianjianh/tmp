'Strong case' to reopen Bow Street and Carno stations

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
There is a strong case to reopen two railway stations in Powys and Ceredigion, claims a regional transport group.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Trains last stopped in Carno, near Newtown, and Bow Street, near Aberystwyth, in the 1960s.
But Mid Wales Transportation, a group working with the Welsh Government, said there was a strong case for future investment in both the stations.
The Welsh Government said it had received the group's report.
Campaigners in both villages have been fighting to reopen their local rail links.
Mid Wales Transportation, also known by its Welsh name of Trafnidiaeth Canolbarth Cymru (TraCC), assists the Welsh Government in delivering its national transport policies in the region.
It has carried out an appraisal into the possibilities of reopening Carno and Bow Street stations.
Its chairman, Trevor Roberts said: "TraCC has responded positively to the request of the National Assembly's Enterprise and Learning Committee and has completed the WelTAG report (transport appraisal).
"The final report clearly demonstrates that there is a strong case for the Welsh Government and rail industry in Wales to include plans for these two new stations in their future investment programmes and I would urge them to do so at their earliest opportunity."
Transport projects seeking funding, such as Carno and Bow Street, are appraised under a scheme funded by the assembly government.
The appraisal is then presented to officials so it can be considered for the assembly government's national transport plan.
A Welsh Government spokeswoman said: "Welsh Government provided assistance to develop the business case for both Carno and Bow Street Station.
"We have received TraCC's conclusion of the business case appraisal, and look forward to future discussion of this with them to identify how they want to prioritise this scheme within their regional transport plan."
Supporters of the campaigns in Carno and Bow Street were unavailable for comment.
