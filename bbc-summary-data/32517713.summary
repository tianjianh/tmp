East Lancashire's election's behaviour battle heats up

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The election has at times got quite heated, with the pressure on the main parties increasing by the day.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
But what about the candidates? How are they behaving?
Well things can get quite hot particularly in a two-horse race in a marginal seat.
The constituency of Rossendale and Darwen has attracted a great deal of attention with Conservative MP Jake Berry hoping to defend the seat he took from Labour back in 2010.
The campaign from both main parties has been intense and this missive from Mr Berry about his opponent Will Straw upped the stakes.
"He is your archetypal professional politician, he's never worked in a business, he's never been out in the real world and I don't think that is right for our area, so I am sure he will be going around making the arguments as to why you should support him, but I think somebody who hasn't got that experience, that experience of the real world, he just wants politics as a career isn't right for east Lancashire.
And this was Mr Straw's response.
"Well Jake Berry's never asked me what I did before I was selected as Labour's candidate.
"If he had done I would have told him I started my career as a civil servant and therefore had to be completely politically impartial, but doing a so-called proper job in the public sector and for the last four years I have been working for a national charity leading the energy transport and climate change team so I find it very ill-informed that he would use that phrase."
Both turned up recently at Bacup market, but managed at least not to bump into each other.
Over at Burnley two former council leaders battle for supremacy, no real fireworks, but I doubt if Gordon Birtwistle and Julie Cooper are meeting together for lunch.
It's an important moment for both, for the winner the spoils.
In Pendle, the Conservative candidate Andrew Stephenson and Labour's Azhar Ali both support the plans for Brierfield Mill but hardly spoke to each other at a recent event about the future of the mill.
You do wonder if they were pondering over their election and how their opponent was doing.
But many of the new candidates in Lancashire have not come out with any cheap shots at other parties.
UKIP's Clive Balchin, who's standing in Rossendale and Darwen, spoke positively of two former Conservative MP's, David Trippier and the late Ken Hargreaves.
Gordon Lishman, the Liberal Democrat candidate in Blackburn, stood by Jack Straw's achievements in the aftermath of the controversy over whether MP's should have second jobs.
He could have had a pop but didn't.
In fact for the most part the candidates have behaved themselves at our debates, prime ministers and party leaders take notice.
It's become very clear during the campaign that voters don't like to hear politicians bickering with each other.
The party which behaves itself might end up being rewarded for its efforts.
