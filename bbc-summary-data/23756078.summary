The station is being doubled in size and will include a number of new shops, cafes and larger waiting areas.
Northampton Borough Council leader David Mackintosh, said: "This will be a facility we can be proud of and will present a fitting welcome for visitors to our town."
Construction is due to be completed in the autumn of next year, with a new car park to be built at a later date.
The West Northamptonshire Development Corporation, which is overseeing the project, said without a bigger station the town's economic growth would be "constrained".
The government is funding half the project, with the rest of the money coming from Northamptonshire County Council and Network Rail.
The station is being built next to the existing building, which will be knocked down once completed.
Prior to building work, excavations of the new site found remains dating back to Saxon times.
