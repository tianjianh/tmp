Candles were lit at Bishopbriggs Academy, East Dunbartonshire, on Thursday, the eve of the memorial.
Scotland's Deputy First Minister John Swinney spoke about the dangers of denying fundamental human freedoms and allowing bigotry to flourish.
International speakers included the daughter of a Holocaust survivor and a survivor of the Rwandan genocide.
Saskia Tepe's mother survived the Holocaust under the Nazis. She told BBC Scotland how her mother had jumped out of train which was heading to Auschwitz.
"Her father died in 1943 and she was put into labour camps and eventually on a train to Auschwitz," Ms Tepe said.
"The labour camp that she was working in at the time was about 50 miles from Auschwitz so the trains they used were freight trains, not the traditional trains that everybody recognises.
"They were open-topped and because of her knowledge of that area she jumped into a snow drift and wasn't seen by the guards and managed to escape."
Rwandan genocide survivor Umutesi Stewart also spoke at Scotland's national commemoration in Bishopbriggs.
The event included performances from young people from across East Dunbartonshire, interpreting this year's Holocaust Memorial Day theme - How can life go on?
Workshops are being held across East Dunbartonshire, East Renfrewshire and Glasgow schools during a week-long programme.
And art exhibitions interpreting this year's theme will display contributions from Low Moss Prison and East Dunbartonshire students.
Provost of East Dunbartonshire, Una Walker, said: "Commemorating the anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz helps the world to remember everyone affected by the Holocaust, as well as other terrible genocides around the world in places such as Cambodia, Rwanda, Bosnia and Darfur.
"I want to pay tribute to everyone involved - particularly Saskia and Umutesi - who delivered incredibly powerful testimonies about the Holocaust and the Rwandan genocide.
"It was an extremely poignant and thought-provoking event - and a timely reminder of why we must never forget the horrors of the past or our responsibility to act to prevent history repeating itself."
Dr Maureen Sier, director of Interfaith Scotland, said: "Sadly the horrors of genocide, war and displacement continue to blight our world and Holocaust Memorial Day reminds us there is still so much to do."
John Swinney said: "We must never forget that the Holocaust and other atrocities, such as Rwanda, Srebrenica and Darfur, are the consequence of the denial of basic human rights and freedoms, and when bigotry and intolerance are allowed to flourish.
"This commemoration was a powerful way to remember these lessons. It is only through learning the lessons of the past that we can create a future in which all our communities can prosper together in peace, which is why I intend to accompany a school visit to Auschwitz-Birkenau later this year."
