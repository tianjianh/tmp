Bevan, 24, was first banned for two years following a positive test for the banned steroid drostanolone in February 2015.
UK Anti-Doping (Ukad) says Bevan's latest ban comes after he refused to submit to testing in September 2016.
Ukad says the ban runs from from 14 October 2016 until 14 January 2024.
South Wales Ironmen signed Bevan in February 2015, when the semi-professional rugby league club was known as South Wales Scorpions.
Responding to a BBC poll into doping in amateur sport earlier this week, Ukad said drug use at every level of sport is "fast becoming a crisis".
The poll found more than a third (35%) of amateur sports people say they personally know someone who has doped, and 8% said they had taken steroids.
Ukad chief Nicole Sapstead described the figures as "incredibly alarming".
