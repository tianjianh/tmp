The Australian made the perfect break in the sixth frame of the match in York - the third 147 of his career.
The pair traded century breaks in the first session leaving Robertson with a 5-3 advantage at the interval.
The next four frames were shared to make it 7-5, but Robertson won three in a row to take the title.
"As a kid, you always want to make a 147 on the BBC so it was a dream come true," Robertson, who claimed the 11th ranking title of his career and second UK triumph, told BBC Sport.
"In the end, it was about digging in and nicking frames."
The final featured two left-handers with contrasting personalities; the measured world number three Robertson and his eccentric Chinese opponent, who frequently played to the crowd and often slapped himself in the face.
Surprise finalist Liang, who moved into the top 16 by reaching the final, added: "There was pressure and I don't know why, I didn't concentrate. The pressure shots I didn't play very well."
Having seen Thailand's Thepchaiya Un-Nooh miss the final black on a maximum effort earlier in the tournament, Robertson went one better.
He needed to disturb a cluster of three reds to keep the break going and then kept his cool to pot the pink with the rest, before punching the air as he sunk the final black.

Six-time UK champion Steve Davis described the break as "absolutely fantastic".
"It was a clinical break early on, he picked the balls off nicely," added Davis. "Doing it in a big final is a marvellous achievement."
Robertson took the first two frames but Liang soon settled in the match with a 110. The pair traded frames as the Aussie led 3-2, before compiling his brilliant 147 break.
The 2013 UK champion also took the next frame, but Liang hit back with a composed 86 to trail 5-3 after the first session.
The man from China reduced the deficit further with an 82 but Robertson responded with a break of 78 and also took the next to lead 7-4.
Liang showed his battling qualities to take the 12th frame, but it was all Robertson from then on.
