The Jim Crowley ridden three-year-old impressed in his Group Two debut, having dominated from the front in last month's Coral Charge at Sandown.
The 9-2 shot finished two and a quarter lengths clear of 9-4 favourite Profitable, who was second.
Marsha was in third, but two-time winner of the race Take Cover ended fourth despite a quick start.

The feeling that a new star is emerging amongst the leading British-trained sprinters continues, as the very speedy Battaash positively swept aside his rivals again.
