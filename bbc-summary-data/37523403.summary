[SN]TITLE[SN]
Duke and Duchess of Cambridge go fishing in Canada

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge went fishing for salmon in waters that residents say are threatened by a liquid natural gas project, during the penultimate day of their Canadian tour.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The royal couple joined a group of teenagers on a fishing boat trip in the waters of the Haida Gwaii archipelago off the British Columbia coast.
They had earlier paddled into the heart of wilderness community in a canoe.
Haida Gwaii means "islands of the people".
Archaeological evidence suggests the area has been inhabited for at least 10,000 years.
The royal couple travelled to the area in a 25ft canoe for about 20 minutes before docking at a pebble beach close to a heritage centre on Graham Island, one of 150 islands in the chain.
Meanwhile, residents staged a silent protest against a multi-billion pound liquid natural gas (LNG) pipeline and export terminal they say will have a detrimental effect on the environment.
The government of Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau approved the Pacific NorthWest LNG export terminal earlier this week.
The duke and duchess wore life jackets for their trip to fish for Coho salmon and to check a crab pot off Graham Island.
As the vessel pulled away from its moorings the duchess was shown a fish in a box and jokingly held it up as if she had caught it - but they later returned without a fish.
Earlier during a welcome ceremony the couple were given scarves trimmed with sea otter fur, gifts that were a mark of respect.
The cedar and spruce-covered islands are home to 5,000 people, of whom about a third belong to the Haida Nation.
The duke and duchess flew by helicopter onto Graham Island after travelling up from their base in Victoria on a military plane.
