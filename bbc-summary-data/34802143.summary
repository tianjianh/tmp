[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Ghana's capital Accra has a reputation for poor waste management, but is trying to turn this to its advantage - recycling human waste into cooking fuel.

Accra has been numbered among the world's most polluted places because of an unregulated dump that now forms part of a sprawling slum.
And with no proper drainage or sewage system, the city's four million residents are also left to rely on a series of open sewers and polluted waterways. These drain the toxic sludge back into the sea.
A lack of toilets and indiscriminate disposal of waste are partly to blame.
In Paris, the UN is hosting a major conference seeking ways to limit climate change. But 6,500km away, in Accra, an enterprising team is taking these matters into its own hands - turning human excrement into cooking fuel. The BBC's Sammy Darko reveals a small scale scheme that has ambitions to go country-wide.
COP 21 - the 21st session of the Conference of the Parties - will see more than 190 nations gather in Paris to discuss a possible new global agreement on climate change, aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions to avoid the threat of dangerous warming due to human activities.
