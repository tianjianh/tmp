Two teenagers detained over Boots store fire in Kilmarnock

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Two teenagers have been detained after being convicted of starting a fire that caused serious damage to a Boots store.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Declan Steele, 18, and a 17-year-old youth, who cannot be named for legal reasons, ignited waste paper outside the store in Kilmarnock in July 2015.
Both denied the charge but were found guilty of wilful fire-raising.
At Kilmarnock Sheriff Court, Steele was told he would be detained for two years and the 17-year-old was ordered to be held for two-and-a-half years.
The court previously heard that the teenagers were seen on CCTV wandering the streets before targeting the store.
They climbed onto the roof from the rear of the building then dropped down into a loading bay and set fire to waste paper.
The pair then sprinted away and hid in bushes to watch the fire take hold before returning to their homeless hostel in the town.
The blaze was tackled by 22 firefighters, some of whom had to crawl through the building to search for potential victims.
Police checked CCTV and detained three suspects that night.
A third accused, aged 17, was originally charged with the offence but did not appear in the dock.
