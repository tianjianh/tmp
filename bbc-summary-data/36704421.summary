Robinson, 21, who previously had two loan spells at the Lilywhites, turned down a new deal with Villa and joins for an undisclosed compensation fee.
Newcastle-born former Rotherham man Pringle, 26, signs for an undisclosed fee after one year with the Cottagers.
Pringle made nine league starts during a short loan spell at Ipswich in 2016.
Robinson told the club's website: "It was obviously a big decision for me leaving Aston Villa, I've been there since I was eight-years-old.
"But, if there was ever a club for me to settle down with and sign permanently with, it would be Preston North End."
