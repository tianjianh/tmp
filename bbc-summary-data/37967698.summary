Sleaford and North Hykeham by-election: UKIP chooses candidate

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
UKIP has selected local councillor Victoria Ayling for the Sleaford and North Hykeham parliamentary by-election on 8 December.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The by-election comes after Conservative MP Stephen Phillips resigned earlier this month, citing "irreconcilable policy differences" with the government.
In last year's election, Mr Phillips had a majority of 24,115.
Mrs Ayling has a seat on Lincolnshire County Council.
Lincolnshire voters were among the most Eurosceptic in the UK in the referendum on EU membership.
UKIP chairman Paul Oaken said: "Victoria is already working hard to represent local people and will now use all of her experience to make sure that UKIP continues to speak up for the common sense voters in Sleaford and North Hykeham."
Consultant paediatrician Dr Caroline Johnson, who contested the Scunthorpe seat in 2010, was selected by the Conservatives.
Labour selected its candidate, trade unionist and refuse driver Jim Clarke, on Wednesday. Labour came second in the constituency in the general election.
Ross Pepper has been selected by the Liberal Democrats.
Local councillor Mark Suffield is standing as an independent while Peter Hill is standing for the Monster Raving Loony Party.
