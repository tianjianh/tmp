Leicester City boss Claudio Ranieri says he is not worried about his future but acknowledges the club's owner is not happy with their domestic form.

The reigning Premier League champions have lost seven games this season and are just two points above the relegation zone.
Asked whether he was concerned about losing his job, Ranieri said: "Never, because it's not my decision.
"Of course [the owner] is not happy - no-one at the club is."
Ranieri added: "The owner is always behind us, he always tells us how he can help us and is always positive."
Leicester chairman Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha hired Ranieri to replace Nigel Pearson in July 2015 and the Italian led the Foxes to an unlikely Premier League title.
They have struggled to replicate last season's form in the league but have been hugely impressive in the Champions League, securing top spot in their group with a game to spare.
And Ranieri is confident his players can turn around Leicester's domestic fortunes.
"When we win, we win together," he said. "When we lose, we lose together.
"My experience says it's important to stay calm and be positive, believe in your players and do the best for your team."
