Scotland v Argentina: Debut for Magnus Bradbury as hosts make four changes

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Magnus Bradbury will make his Scotland debut as head coach Vern Cotter makes four changes for Saturday's Test with Argentina at Murrayfield.

The 21-year-old lines up with Edinburgh team-mate Hamish Watson and John Barclay in the back row.
Grant Gilchrist replaces injured lock Richie Gray, while winger Tommy Seymour returns to take over from Tim Visser.
The final change from last weekend's late loss to Australia sees Fraser Brown start at hooker.
Ross Ford, who won his 100th cap in the 23-22 defeat, drops to the bench, along with Visser and Ryan Wilson.
Edinburgh back row Cornell du Preez was called up for the first time, but there is no place in the matchday squad for the South Africa-born 25-year-old, who became eligible last month through residency rules.
Cotter said that the game has come too soon for Du Preez to make his debut, but club-mate Bradbury gets the call.
"He's impressed us in training, he gets an opportunity," said the head coach.
"He's athletic and we're playing a team that moves the ball pretty quickly. He's well balanced between attack and defence, he's not a one-dimensional player.
"He can jump in the lineout and turnover ball he carries well. He moves across the ground.
"We're playing a team that offloads the ball a lot, with athletic forwards, so we need defensive qualities, but we also want to take the ball to them and Magnus gives us the opportunity to run very hard at them as well."
Richie Gray suffered a head knock against Australia, as did John Hardie, an early replacement for Wilson against Australia, who is expected to be out of action for eight weeks after surgery on his sprained ankle.
"If you look at last week's game, there were 500 collisions and Richie had a big part of those and can't take the field this week," said Cotter.
"That's what happens, but it's opportunities for others. We selected a squad knowing that getting to the last game we might have a few guys down. We just try do our best."
There are two changes among the replacements, with prop Alex Allan and lock Tim Swinson coming in for Gordon Reid and the promoted Gilchrist.
Scotland are aiming for a third consecutive victory over the Pumas, following a 41-31 success at Murrayfield two years ago and a 21-19 win in Cordoba in the summer of 2014.
Argentina have the upper hand overall, with nine victories from the 15 meetings since the first recognised Test in 1990.
"Every week we want to improve," added Cotter. "We did a lot of good things against Australia: we scored three tries to their two, we were aggressive in attack and our defence held strong for the most part.
"While it's disappointing we didn't walk off with the win, I'm proud of the courage the players showed and the way they adapted to changes due to injuries.
"Saturday's game is going to be a different challenge for us, both physically and mentally, against a very dangerous Argentina side."
Scotland: Hogg, Maitland, Jones, Dunbar, Seymour, Russell, Laidlaw (capt), Dell, Brown, Fagerson, Gilchrist, J Gray, Bradbury, Watson, Barclay.
Replacements: Ford, Allan, Low, Swinson, Wilson, Price, Horne, Visser.
