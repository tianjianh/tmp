Ice hockey: Dutiame demands consistency from Fife Flyers

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Fife Flyers coach Todd Dutiaume says he's been delighted at his team's league form against the teams in the Erhardt Conference.

The Kirkcaldy side head into 14 straight games of Gardiner Conference games after Saturday's 3-2 overtime win over Belfast Giants.
And Dutiaume believes his team can stay in the top half of the table.
"It comes down to consistency and that competitive spirit night in, night out," he said.
"If you look at the fixtures we've had from the start of the season until now, it's been a lot of games against teams in the southern Conference," he said.
"I have to say I'm pretty delighted with what we've got from them and Saturday was a good morale booster going into a heavy run of Conference games for us.
"Now we're heading into that time of the season where you get into the nitty gritty, but there's no reason we shouldn't be in this top half of the league and be comfortable there.
Flyers' victory on Saturday in their only game of the weekend ended a three-game losing streak as Russ Moyer's overtime winner in a 3-2 result.
Alex Foster and Josh Scoon traded goals for both teams in the first period, with Brendan Brooks and Giants coach Derrick Walser doing the same in the second.
But Moyer clinched it 31 seconds into the extra period to take the result that kept the Flyers sitting in fourth place in the table.
Dundee Stars and Braehead Clan went head-to-head in a double header weekend, starting in Glasgow as Ryan Finnerty's side returned to home ice after five weeks on the road.
But it didn't go to plan as the Stars took the points in a 6-4 win, with Kevin Hart, Vinny Scarsella and Justin Faryna putting them 3-0 up after the first period.
Matt Haywood pulled one back, but further goals from Faryna and Cale Tanaka gave Dundee a 5-1 lead before Matt Beca added two for Clan in the third period.
Scarsella's second wrapped the victory although Alex Leavitt added a fourth for the home side in the last second of the game.
Both sides headed to Dundee on Sunday with the Stars hoping to making it a four point weekend, but Clan recovered to take the points on this occasion, winning 6-3.
Matt White and Mike Hammond scored one apiece for each side, with Scarsella and Scott Pitt doing the same as the first period ended at 2-2.
Beca put Braehead in front, but that one was cancelled out by Felix-Antoine Poulin.  But two from Levitt and Pitt's second secured the points for Braehead in the third period.
Edinburgh Capitals ended the weekend without a point as they came up against runaway leaders Cardiff Devils on Saturday then Belfast Giants on Sunday.
They travelled to Wales and were three down through two from Layne Ulmer and one from Matthew Myers before Jacob Johnston found the board near the end of the second period.
Andrew Lord and Andrew Hotham put Devils 5-1 and although Yevgeni Fyodorov clawed one back, Jake Morrissette sealed the 6-2 win for Cardiff in the third period.
Capitals returned to Murrayfield on Sunday and despite a third period fightback, Belfast did enough to end their weekend in Scotland with a three-point weekend.
Chris Higgins, Mike Forney and Steve Saviano put the Giants three ahead, with Mike D'Orazio finding the net for Edinburgh shortly.
Blair Riley added Giants' fourth early in the third, but goals from Michal Dobron and Ian Schultz got Edinburgh to within one.
However two more from Riley in the final two minutes ensured a comfortable end to the game as the Caps couldn't force anything from the contest.

Braehead Clan 4 Dundee Stars 6
