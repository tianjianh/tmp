The 21-year-old was on loan at Fir Park from Everton for the second half of last season, playing four games in May.
Griffiths, who has also had loan spells at Halifax and Cheltenham, is the sixth summer arrival at Motherwell.
"Russell showed a tremendous attitude towards the tail end of last season and put in some terrific performances for us in an important run of games," said manager Stephen Robinson.
"We're delighted to have secured Russell's signature and to have that competition for the number one jersey is crucial."
Goalkeeper Trevor Carson, 29, joined the club earlier this month after leaving Hartlepool United.
