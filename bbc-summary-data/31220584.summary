Why Rita Ora and Paloma Faith are singing Barlow songs

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
So Gary Barlow's soundtrack for musical Finding Neverland has already been reworked by a load of big-name singers.

You'll be hearing versions of the Take That frontman's songs performed by Rita Ora, Paloma Faith and Jessie J on The Concept Album.
So what is it about music stars wanting a slice of the action from screen or stage?
American film producer Harvey Weinstein tells Newsbeat it's a chance to pull together "an amazing group of people".
We reckon it might be a pretty good money-spinner too which means filmmakers get access to a new audience in the shape of the musicians' fans.
Take the excitement around Jay Z's involvement with the Great Gatsby soundtrack, Lourde's involvement on the Hunger Games Mockingjay record or Beyonce's remix on the Fifty Shades album.
Weinstein, whose firm The Weinstein Company put Â£7m into The Imitation Game, is backing Finding Neverland on New York's Broadway, probably the most famous street on earth for musicals.
He also let slip to Newsbeat that his wife is a long-time Gary Barlow fan.
"She was a Gary girl. Someone else was a Robbie girl. I didn't even know what a Gary girl or a Robbie girl was until about five years ago," he explained.
Now he's been educated in all things Take That, Harvey's excited to be working with Gary.
"We're getting Rita Ora, Jessie J, all these incredible people are going to do a cast album called The Concept Album.
"It hasn't been done since Jesus Christ Superstar, where you take a show like Finding Neverland and you get all these people to interpret the songs in their own way.
"We're putting together an amazing group of people. Paloma Faith recorded her track [last week]."
The show hits Broadway in April, just in time for the Tony Awards (the Oscars of the stage world).
"I think it's becoming a very acceptable thing to do, that musicians want to be part of a movie," Weinstein explained.
"U2 did Mandela last year and won a Golden Globe and got nominated for the Oscar.
"It's a hard road though, You know, I mean for U2, they spent months promoting the movie and their song and as a result probably took time away from their own album.
"But to a successful musician, it's something worthwhile."
'I could be the biggest rock star in the world'
Newsbeat asked which artists have been banging at Harvey's door to be part of Quentin Tarantino's new film the Hateful Eight, which has begun shooting in Canada.
"The Hateful Eight? Everybody. Are you kidding me? Quentin Tarantino. Whatever.
"I could be the biggest rock star in the world, just by saying, 'you, you, and you, you come with me and do a song for that movie'.
"Unfortunately Quentin won't let me do it, as much as I'm begging him to let me be cool for a day. Everybody wants to do that.
"Quentin has his own esoteric taste, it doesn't matter that they want to do it, it's what he wants to do. And Quentin's loyal to only one thing. His fans and what they expect of him."
But, teasingly, he did add: "You know, I think there are going to be some very interesting people associated with that soundtrack."
