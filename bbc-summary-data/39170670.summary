[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Sergio Romero made a series of fine saves as Southampton and Manchester United played out a goalless draw at St Mary's.

Saints should have gone ahead within five minutes when Eric Bailly was adjudged to have handled in the area, but United goalkeeper Romero saved Manolo Gabbiadini's penalty.
Bailly's sharp shot was stopped by Fraser Forster, as the United defender created his side's best chance of the first half.
Southampton forced Romero to make multiple blocks after the break while Anthony Martial hit the post from 25 yards for the visitors.
With Jose Mourinho's side guaranteed a sixth-place finish before kick-off and one eye firmly on next Wednesday's Europa League final, it always looked like being a sedate affair on the south coast and that is how it turned out.
Southampton fans have only seen 37 goals at St Mary's this season - only Old Trafford, with 36, has seen fewer Premier League goals in 2016-17.
Their terrible run in front of goal at St Mary's continued - they have now gone 365 minutes without scoring at home - and suffered yet another miss from the penalty spot.
Romero pulled off a superb low save to stop Gabbiadini's strike, as Southampton missed their third penalty in the past five games.
With speculation surrounding his future, Puel's nerves would have been eased by a victory to tighten their grip on eighth spot.
His side host Stoke on the final day of the season on Sunday but could still finish as low as 11th. They are one point ahead of West Brom in ninth and Bournemouth in 10th. Leicester, who are three points behind in 11th, have a game in hand against Tottenham on Thursday.
But with a League Cup final appearance under his belt, the 55-year-old Puel could have done enough to earn another season at St Mary's.
Under Sir Alex Ferguson, Manchester United did not finish outside of the top three in the Premier League era, but since his departure in 2013 United have not finished inside the top three.
It will also be the first time that current boss Mourinho has finished lower than third in his managerial career.
Mourinho made clear in recent weeks that his focus is firmly on winning the Europa League and securing Champions League qualification next season.
Following consecutive league defeats by Arsenal and Tottenham, he made four changes against Saints and had youngsters Demetri Mitchell and Scott McTominay on the substitutes' bench.
His side were once again lacklustre against Southampton and they would have slipped to a third consecutive league defeat had it not been for Argentine goalkeeper Romero.
One downside for Mourinho was that the sight of midfielder Marouane Fellaini limping off after 75 minutes.
While Romero will play in goal in the Europa League final, Mourinho also confirmed that third-choice goalkeeper Joel Pereira will make his Premier League debut against Crystal Palace on Sunday.
Injured David de Gea did not travel with the squad to Southampton, but when asked about the Spaniard's future, Mourinho said the 26-year-old will play for the club again.
"He'll play the first match against LA Galaxy in pre-season in Los Angeles," he said.
"I hope to play Sergio in the final and hopefully we don't have problems with the keepers. David is top of the world and obviously we want to keep the top in the world."

Southampton manager Claude Puel said: "We can feel shame after this game because we had many opportunities in the second half.
"We had two different halves - the first one was without intensity and it was very difficult after the penalty because that would have given us the confidence.
"The second half was interesting as there was quality and many chances without a good reward.
"But this point is important for us in the table."
When asked about his future, Puel said: "I think it's important to stay focused on the last game and to finish strong. After the last game it is normal to have a discussion about the season."
