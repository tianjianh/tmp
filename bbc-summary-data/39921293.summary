Baxter won the mountain bike race, finished joint second in the 82-mile (130 km) road race and seventh in the 1.5 mile (2.4 km) hill climb.
He said he was "delighted" to retain his title after three tough events.
Mark Christian won Sunday's Grand Fondo in a time of 3 hrs 52 mins and 6 secs, 5 mins 50 secs clear of Baxter and Rob Sorby, who crossed the line together.
Carolyn Brown won the women's event in 4 hrs 44:29 minutes to take home the overall women's title.
Brown had already won Saturday's hill climb and finished third in the women's mountain bike race, won by Emma Atkinson.
Hundreds of people watched the events which were based at the Milntown estate in Ramsey in the north of the island.
Organiser Paul Phillips said he was happy with how the festival, now in its second year, had gone.
"It is a massive logistical challenge to combine the cycling, music and food. It is a celebration of all three," he added.
"I think Cyclefest is the best cycling festival in the British Isles that no-one has heard of. We've got an event that can go from strength to strength."
Nigel Beattie won Sunday's 39-mile (63km) Medio Fondo in 2 hrs 0:27, with 15-year-old Daniel Sowerby winning the Piccolo Fondo in 1:09.05.
Cyclefest also included mass participation ride outs for all ages and abilities designed to celebrate cycling.
