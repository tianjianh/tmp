Lawro's Premier League predictions v UFC star Michael Bisping

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
BBC Sport's football expert Mark Lawrenson will be making a prediction for all 380 Premier League games this season against a variety of guests.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Lawro's opponent for this week's Premier League fixtures is UFC star Michael Bisping.
Englishman Bisping, who is also starring in new action film xXx: Return of Xander Cage, is a Manchester United fan - and unsurprisingly backs them to beat old foes Liverpool.

You can make your Premier League predictions now, compare them with those of Lawro and other fans, and try to take your team to the top of the leaderboard by playing the BBC Sport Predictor game.
A correct result (picking a win, draw or defeat) is worth 10 points. The exact score earns 40 points.
On FA Cup third-round weekend, Lawro got nine correct results, including three perfect scores from the 32 ties for a total of 180 points.
He was up against a trio of YouTubers - Manchester City fan Alex from Blue Moon Rising TV, Tottenham supporter Barnaby from Spurred On and Arsenal fan Reev.
Alex came out on top, with 14 correct predictions, including three perfect scores.
Those scores do not count towards Lawro's total for the season from Premier League fixtures or appear on the guest leaderboard.
All kick-offs 15:00 GMT unless otherwise stated.

Everton v Man City (13:30 GMT)
Everton have already started their shopping in the January sales and I would expect one of their new signings, Morgan Schneiderlin, to go straight into their midfield on Sunday.
Manchester City could have their own new-boy, Brazilian striker Gabriel Jesus, involved at some point - but I cannot see Pep Guardiola just throwing him straight in.
Goodison Park will be rocking because it is City, and because Everton are signing some players. I am not sure the feel-good factor will be enough for them, though.
Lawro's prediction: 1-2
Man Utd v Liverpool (16:00 GMT)
Manchester United got a 0-0 draw at Anfield in October in a game that was basically a Jose Mourinho masterpiece.
His gameplan was to restrict Liverpool to relatively few chances, and it worked.
United will be far more ambitious in attack at Old Trafford, however, and Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp has some big decisions to make over the fitness of some of his players.
If Joel Matip is 75% fit I think Klopp will be tempted to play him, especially if Jordan Henderson is not quite ready.
This is a massive game for both teams and I think it will end up with a point apiece. I think Arsenal, Chelsea, Manchester City and Tottenham would settle for that result too.
Lawro's prediction: 1-1
Lawro was speaking to BBC Sport's Chris Bevan.
Lawro's best score: 160 points (week 13 v Tim Vine)
Lawro's worst score: 30 points (week four v Dave Bautista)
