Truro City manager Lee Hodges says he is concerned about his team's poor run of form in National League South.

The White Tigers have lost four successive league games, having not got a victory since 19 November, and have slumped to 16th in the division, two points above the relegation places.
"It is worrying because we've got to get those points on the board as quickly as possible," Hodges said.
"We've been in every game that we've played in and at times we've dominated.
"We have to make that domination count and put teams to bed, because we are creating chances," he added to BBC Radio Cornwall.
City, who parted company with player-coach Rory Fallon and former Torquay full-back Durrell Berry last month, have signed Gulls youngster Charlie Duke on a one-month loan.
But Hodges says he is hopeful of bringing more players to Treyew Road during the transfer window:
"The aim is to hopefully add to the squad that we've got at the moment by the end of the weekend.
"I will keep persevering to try and get some lads in to help the boys we have already."
