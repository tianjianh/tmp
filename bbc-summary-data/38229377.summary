Police have released CCTV images of a car they want to trace after a woman was raped in Glasgow.

The woman was attacked at about 00:05 on Monday, near to Eastwood Crescent in Thornliebank.
The car in the police images is a light-coloured, possibly silver, Ford Fiesta.
Its driver was described as being of either Asian or Eastern European appearance, aged between 30 and 40, with dark hair and eyes.
He was wearing a dark-coloured T-shirt.
The car was seen in Kilmarnock Road, Shawlands, shortly before the attack. Two 18-year-old women are thought to have got into it in the early hours of Monday before it was later spotted on Carnwadric Road, Thornliebank.
Det Insp Graeme McLachlan, at the Greater Glasgow Public Protection Unit, said: "Our inquiries into this incident are continuing. We are keen to trace both the driver and the vehicle as it is believed that this may result in information that can assist the police with this investigation.
"I would like to speak to anyone who was in the vicinity of Kilmarnock Road, Shawlands, between midnight on Sunday 4 December and the early hours of Monday 5 December, who may have seen a light-coloured Ford Fiesta in the area.
"Anyone who has any information that could assist our inquiries is asked to contact the Greater Glasgow Public Protection Unit via 101 or alternatively Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111 where anonymity can be maintained."
