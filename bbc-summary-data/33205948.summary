'Think big' Lib Dem members told

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Norman Lamb has got his opening patter down to a fine art. "I can confidently predict that this is an election which will be won by a Liberal Democrat", he tells his audience in the lecture hall of a Cambridge college.

The East's one remaining Liberal Democrat MP is making his pitch for leader before party members in the region. The day before he'd been in Southampton not getting home until after midnight.  In one week the itinerary also included London, Newcastle, Leeds and Manchester. Then it's off to Scotland.
His message to his party is that it can come back from its catastrophic defeat and it needs to start believing in itself again.
"I have an ambition for our party to think big, we need to win the battle of ideas. I want it to be an intellectual power house," he tells them.
In the eyes of some people Mr Lamb is tainted by his time as a coalition minister. He refuses to apologise for "stepping up to the plate" and is proud to list the party's achievements in government, in particular his own work on the NHS and moving the issue of mental health up the agenda.
He's also keen for the party which fell out with so many students over the issue of tuition fees, to make a new pitch to young people.
"I want to inspire a whole new generation of young people who are fundamentally liberal in their attitudes to see us as the party that represents their values,'" he says.
Once he's finished speaking, it's the turn of the other person who wants the job; the former party president Tim Farron.
Mr Farron also talks about the party being ambitious, about it identifying the big problems and the big solutions.
"We need to move people into being terrified about climate change," he says.
"We mustn't be afraid about talking about civil liberties. If 70% of people don't care about civil liberties I don't care. 30% do and that's good enough for me."
Mr Farron believes that there is very little difference between him and Norman Lamb on policy and ambition. For him it's all about character.
"We lost the election not because we had the wrong policies but because of a very clear failure to communicate with the electorate," he said.
"If the party wants someone to communicate, inspire, campaign and get our message across so people listen, then perhaps that fits my skill-set more than the others."
It's worth noting how big a challenge lies in the East for whoever wins. After spending 20 years establishing itself in the region, the party lost three of its four seats in the east in May and nearly half of its councillors. On many authorities there is now no Lib Dem representation, on those where it still exists there are normally just one or two Lib Dems still standing.
Perhaps not surprisingly, Norman Lamb is being supported by most of the former Lib Dem parliamentarians for the east: Simon Wright (former MP for Norwich South), Sir Bob Russell (Colchester), Julian Huppert (Cambridge) and Andrew Duff (former MEP) have all said they'll vote for him. David Howarth, who was the MP for Cambridge until 2010, is supporting Tim Farron.
Lamb's friends describe him as "an ideas man" who understands what voters really care about but opponents worry that he may not stand out enough from the other party leaders at Westminster.
It's critical that the leader of a party with just eight MPs and one MEP can revive its fortunes.
That is the debate that is taking place among the party's 61,000 (and rising) members. They vote next month.
Mr Lamb has suspended two members of his campaign team amid allegations that they may have breached data protection laws.
It's being claimed that the contact details of party members were used to put out negative messages about Mr Lamb's rival for the leadership, Tim Farron.
Mr Lamb has denied any wrongdoing and said he did not know anything about it.
