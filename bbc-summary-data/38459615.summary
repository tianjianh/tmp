The three-month-old was found in playing fields in Stourbridge, West Midlands, on Boxing Day.
The female "Staffie-type" dog, named Ali by RSPCA staff, had puncture wounds to its leg and had collapsed.
Staff at the Animal Hospital in Birmingham said the dog had been shivering uncontrollably and in a lot of pain. She was put down "after taking a turn for the worse".

An RSPCA spokeswoman said: "We don't know for certain how she got her injuries - they could have been a deliberate act, or she might have been attacked by wildlife. She was clearly very vulnerable out in the open on her own and at such a young age."
The dog, who wasn't microchipped, was found in playing fields off Vicarage Road.
