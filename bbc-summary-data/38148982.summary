The 32-year-old became Wales' first medallist at London 2012 when he won silver in the lightweight men's four after they missed out on gold to South Africa by less than a second.
Bartley, from Wrexham, was part of the men's four at Rio, but the team missed out on the medals, finishing seventh.
In 2010, Bartley won gold with the men's lightweight four at the World Rowing Championships in New Zealand.
"I've had quite a long career. I've been involved in the sport internationally for more than 10 years," he told BBC Radio Wales.
"I've got more than I ever thought that I would out of the sport and I thought it was the right time for me to call it a day."
