[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Prosecutors are to investigate whether a website in support of footballer Ched Evans has committed an offence over the identification of a woman he raped.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The attorney general has also asked North Wales Police to investigate a possible offence of contempt of court.
Earlier in January the attorney general's office confirmed it was looking into a website supporting convicted rapist Ched Evans.
It follows a letter of complaint from the victim's father in November.
The possible offence of contempt of court relates to the handling of evidence in the original criminal case against Evans in 2012.
Oldham Athletic recently pulled out of plans to sign the footballer, who was freed from prison last October.
A spokeswoman for Attorney General Jeremy Wright said he had "asked the Crown Prosecution Service to consider whether any criminal offences may have been committed in regards to identifying the victim in the Ched Evans case".
Prison sentence
"He has also asked North Wales Police to investigate whether some of the material served during the course of the proceedings has been dealt with properly.  If not, this may constitute a contempt of court.
She added: "Given that there is now the possibility of proceedings being brought, it is very important that there is no comment in the media which might jeopardise either the investigation or any subsequent proceedings."
It is an offence in England and Wales to publish material likely to lead members of the public to identify the victim in a rape case.
Former Wales international Evans, who previously played for clubs including Manchester City and Sheffield United, was jailed in April 2012 for raping a woman in Rhyl, north Wales.
He was released from prison in October after serving half of a five-year sentence.
Evans continues to protest his innocence, and an investigation into his conviction by the Criminal Cases Review Commission is under way.
