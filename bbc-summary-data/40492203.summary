The 22-year-old impressed during a short loan spell earlier this year and will return to Scotstoun on a two-year contract for the coming season.
Warriors assistant coach Jason O'Halloran said: "Brandon really impressed during his short loan spell.
"He is able to play in several positions across the backline."
Thomson, who scored a try in the first of his three Warriors appearances, can play at fly-half and full-back and has scored 26 points for the Stormers in seven Super Rugby appearances.
He has also represented South Africa Under-20s at the Junior World Rugby Championship and has played for Western Province in the Provincial Cup and Currie Cup.
Thomson told Warriors' website: "I'm very excited to be heading back to Scotstoun. I really enjoyed my short stint there earlier in the year and I'm looking forward to many more good times.
"The relationships I built in Glasgow was definitely a big contributing factor to going back.
"They are a great bunch of guys and made me feel at home right from the start."
Current Stormers team-mates Huw Jones and Oli Kebble will also join this summer as Dave Rennie - who takes over from Gregor Townsend as Glasgow Warriors coach in the summer - reshapes the squad he had inherited from new Scotland coach Gregor Townsend.
"Dave Rennie is an excellent coach and has done very well with the Chiefs, so I'm super excited to have the opportunity to learn and be part of his set-up," added Thomson.
"The likes of Huw and Oli also being there is awesome. It's like bringing a little part of home with me and I'm sure we'll do great together in Glasgow colours."
