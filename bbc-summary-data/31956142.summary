[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Tairod Nathan Webster Pugh, a 47-year-old former aircraft mechanic from New Jersey, spoke only to repeat his name to the judge.
His lawyer, Michael K Schneider, entered the plea on his behalf.
Mr Pugh has been charged with trying to provide material support to a terrorist group and obstructing justice.
He was stopped at a Turkish airport in January with a laptop that had detailed information on border crossings into Syria and jihadist videos, according to court papers.
A letter he allegedly wrote to a woman thought to be his wife says: "I will use the talents and skills given to me by Allah to establish and defend the Islamic States."
Mr Pugh is an American citizen who was born and raised in the US, prosecutors say.
According to a statement from the US Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of New York, Mr Pugh served as an avionics specialist and mechanic in the US Air Force.
After he left the military, he did similar work for several companies in the United States and the Middle East.
Judge Nicholas Garaufis arranged for another hearing in May to review the evidence and discuss the plea.
