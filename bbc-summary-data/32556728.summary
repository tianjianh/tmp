Anna Sharad Gautam, 22, from Kathmandu, and Katharina Hopp, 23, from Germany, are studying international politics at Aberystwyth University.
They have organised a beach barbeque, a cake sale, and a film night.
Anna said she had felt "helpless" after news of the quake came through.
In the aftermath of the earthquake, her parents and sister, who live in Kathmandu, were forced to spend the first few days in temporary shelter and camping in the garden of their home, for fear of further damage caused by aftershocks.
Anna said: "For the first two days it was not possible to contact my family, but now I know they are safe and I'm able to speak to them via the internet.
"My plan is to think beyond the immediate event and raise funds to build better homes, especially in the villages outside Kathmandu. It is the older buildings in Kathmandu and the surrounding villages, often houses built of mud, that have collapsed."
All the money raised by the Aberystwyth International Nepal Emergency Fund will go towards the British Red Cross Nepal Earthquake Appeal
Anna and Katharina will travel to Kathmandu at the beginning of June to start a three-month internship with Saathi, an organisation dedicated to tackling domestic violence against women.
