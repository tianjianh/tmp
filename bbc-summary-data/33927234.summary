[SN]TITLE[SN]
Scarborough foodstore approved for former football stadium site

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Plans for a foodstore on part of the former McCain football stadium site in Scarborough have been approved.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The sale of the site in Seamer Road is to help the council fund a leisure village and a new home for Scarborough Athletic Football Club.
Scarborough Borough Councillors approved plans for a single-storey foodstore.
The site ceased to be used as a football stadium in 2007 and the stands were demolished later.
Plans for a new football stadium and swimming pool were approved by councillors in May.
A 2,000-capacity ground on the Weaponness car park is to be the new home of Scarborough Athletic Football Club.
The football club has had to play its home games about 16 miles (26 km) away in Bridlington since 2007.
In addition to the community stadium, the development will include a pool, sports hall and squash courts.
The report to the planning committee said, subject to funding, starting work on the leisure village could be approved in September.
A separate application for 45 houses on another part of the Seamer Road site is also to be considered at a later meeting.
