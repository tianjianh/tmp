After the 1-0 loss to Bury on Saturday, the Latics are 23rd in the table and eight points from safety.
Sheridan returned for his second spell as manager earlier this month after Oldham sacked David Dunn.
"I feel as though we've got to probably win nine games which I think is achievable," the 51-year-old told BBC Radio Manchester.
"I think if I can get a couple of players in, get them playing the way I want to play in different systems, and trying to get a little bit more out of the players that are here we can do it.
"We know it's going to be difficult, it's going to be very difficult, but I really do believe."
The former Newport, Plymouth and Chesterfield boss has promised to improve the squad before the transfer window closes.
"There's definitely going to be, before the Blackpool game, at least three or four fresh faces in," he added.
