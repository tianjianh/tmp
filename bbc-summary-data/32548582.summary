Controversial Kirkintilloch road crossing plan changed

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Controversial plans to scrap controlled crossings at a busy road junction as part of Scotland's first "shared space" system have been watered down.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
East Dunbartonshire Council wanted to change the Catherine Street junction in Kirkintilloch and remove traffic lights, barriers, kerbs and crossings.
This "shared space" plan, where traffic and pedestrians share right of way, is aimed at improving safety.
Following protests from local people, controlled crossing are to be kept.
Council leader Rhondda said: "We recognise and accept that there have been a range of views and a number of concerns expressed by members of the community and groups over the past few months.
"We want to reassure people that we have listened and that work has been ongoing to address those anxieties - to reach a compromise that will help achieve the goals of the master plan while also addressing the legitimate concerns of our citizens.
"We feel the amended proposals recognise and address those concerns - ensuring controlled crossings remain in place for anyone requiring additional reassurance in using the reshaped junction - allowing a period of awareness-raising and education to take place with the wider community."
