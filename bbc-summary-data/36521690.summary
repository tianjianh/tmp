Karen Hodgkinson was hit by a full beer can thrown by one of the "feral gang" outside her home in Mold, Flintshire.
Seven teenagers, aged 13 to 19, admitted violent disorder and one of them, a 17-year-old who threw the can, admitted wounding.
They were detained for periods ranging from six months to 12 months while the 13-year-old got a rehabilitation order at Mold Crown Court on Monday.
Mrs Hodgkinson needed a metal plate inserting during surgery to repair her fractured eye socket, but lost the sight in her left eye following the attack on Halloween.
Judge Geraint Walters said the gang turned up at her home, some wearing Halloween masks, in a move orchestrated by a gang of feral youths "who believe that they are beyond the reach of the law."
The Hodgkinsons were subjected to abuse before they were punched and the can was thrown.
"No decent people in any town centre should ever have to witness that kind of Wild West scene in which each of you played your part," said Mr Walters.
The judge also made a five-year restraining order, banning them from approaching the victims or entering Elm Drive in Mold.
Prosecutor David Mainstone said the family had been plagued by anti-social behaviour by youths who congregated outside the parade of shops opposite their home.
He alleged the seven defendants were part of a group which had been making their lives a misery, subjecting them to verbal abuse, violence and damaging their property.
Simon Killeen, for Rogers, said he was a family man who had acted out of character.
Andrew Green for the 16-year-old said he was a follower rather than a leader.
Philip Clemo, for Gentile, said he had not thrown any missiles or punches.
The court heard the 13-year-old had shown "genuine remorse" while Dodd had not thrown anything.
Mr Green, for the boy who threw the can, said he had clearly not intended such an injury and had shown remorse.
The other 17-year-old wanted to stop using cannabis and cut down on how much alcohol he drank, the court heard.
