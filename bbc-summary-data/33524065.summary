A man - named locally as Erdogan Guzel - died at the scene, and a woman remains in hospital with serious injuries.
Police believe the pair were not the intended targets of the attack on 10 July.
Officers arrested six people at Gatwick Airport and another three at an address in Hornsey, north London.
The Met said three males and three females, aged between 16 and 61, were arrested on suspicion of either murder or conspiracy to murder.
Three men were also arrested at an address in Hornsey, north London, aged 23, 26 and 55, on suspicion of murder.
The three females have been released on bail and the others remain in custody.
Det Ch Insp Tim Duffield said: "What is clear is that two innocent bystanders have been caught up in a violent dispute between other persons."
He said he believed "there are people out there who know who is responsible for this terrible crime" and called on them to come forward.
Det Ch Insp Duffield gave an assurance that measures could be taken to protect anyone concerned about contacting the police.
Police were called at about 17:45 BST on 10 July to reports of a shooting on Lordship Lane, Wood Green, north London.
The 42-year-old man was pronounced dead at the scene. The Met has not formally identified him, but his next of kin have been informed.
The 51-year-old woman remains in hospital in a critical, but stable, condition.
