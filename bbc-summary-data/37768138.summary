Naomi Long to officially become Alliance Party leader later

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Naomi Long will become the new leader of the Alliance Party later.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The East Belfast MLA is currently serving as the deputy leader.
She is the only candidate for the vacancy, and will succeed David Ford - who stood down earlier this month after 15 years in the job.
Members of the party council, which has 250 members, will elect her at a meeting in East Belfast hotel this evening.
The former MP for East Belfast began her political career at Belfast City Council where she served as Lord Mayor.
She lost her Westminster seat to the DUP's Gavin Robinson in 2015 who triumphed with support from the UUP.
Speaking earlier this month, Mrs Long said she would take the opportunity to "refresh, renew and re-energise the party".
