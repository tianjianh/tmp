The Bluebirds have signed Jazz Richards and Frederic Gounongbe during this summer, with Kenneth Zohore and Lex Immers joining on permanent deals.
Trollope did not reveal which positions he wanted to strengthen, but said he was keen to add to a "few areas".
"We are still trying to add one or two new faces and maybe one or two going out as well," he said.
"With the emergency loan window no longer at our disposal, I think it will be a busy three weeks for a lot of people.
"A lot of clubs will be in the same situation. There will be a lot of movement.
"I've got a real good feel about the group and what we're capable of.
"We know it's a strong division with some big clubs in, but if we can add in a few areas we think we could compete."
Defender Fabio da Silva could be one player to leave Cardiff City Stadium with newly promoted Premier League side Middlesbrough interested in signing the 26-year-old Brazilian defender.
Fabio missed Cardiff's 0-0 draw at Birmingham City on the opening weekend of the Championship season, Trollope's first competitive game in charge since succeeding Russell Slade in May.
Cardiff face Bristol Rovers away in the first round of the EFL Cup on Thursday before home league games against Queens Park Rangers and Blackburn Rovers.
"You're always trying to gauge where you are in the early part of the season," Trollope added.
"I'm sure every club thinks pre-season has gone well and people are fit - so it's a good gauge of where you are."
