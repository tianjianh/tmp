[SN]TITLE[SN]
Ceredigion councillors back small school closures

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Councillors in Ceredigion have voted to close two small primary schools.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Cwmpadarn school in Llanbadarn Fawr, near Aberystwyth, will shut along with Ysgol Llangyfelyn at Taliesin, near Machynlleth.
Full council backed a decision taken by the cabinet in September and agreed that Cwmpadarn should shut.
Pupil numbers have dropped under 30 at Llangyfelin, with 24 councillors voting to shut the school, nine against and one abstention.
Parents of both schools have held vocal campaigns to save their primaries, and lobbied councillors ahead of Thursday's vote.
