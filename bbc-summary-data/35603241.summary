It follows a police investigation into complaints of sectarian singing at the match at Stair Park on 10 January.
The probe also focused on flares, smoke bombs and fire crackers set off and thrown on to the pitch.
The five are due to appear at Stranraer Sheriff Court "in due course", police said.
A further four people were arrested for football-related and public order offences on the day of the match.
Match commander Supt Steven Lowther said the behaviour of a minority on match day was "unacceptable".
He said: "What was supposed to be an enjoyable event for all was tarnished by a group of individuals who were intent on singing sectarian songs as well as letting off smoke bombs and pyrotechnics within the crowd.
"It is evident that those involved had no concerns for either the safety of others or how their behaviour spoiled what should otherwise have been an event where the post-match discussion should have centred on football and not their antics."
