At least five people have been killed after a fire broke out in one of the most expensive shopping centres in Peru's capital Lima, officials say.

The blaze started in a recently-renovated cinema where a film screening was taking place for journalists.
The cause of the fire is still being investigated.
The incident comes ahead of a global summit later this week in Lima which will be attended by the presidents of the US, Russia, China and Japan.
Interior Minister Carlos Basombrio told local media that sound-proof walls in the theatre appeared to be flammable, which allowed the fire to spread.
A large black mushroom cloud rose above the seaside Larcomar shopping centre as people with breathing difficulties were helped into ambulances.
At least one firefighter was also carried away on a stretcher.
Larcomar, managed by Chilean company Parque Arauco SA, said it was co-operating fully with the authorities and would close the centre for two days.
The British embassy in Lima, which is less than a block away from the mall, has been closed, the British government said in a statement.
