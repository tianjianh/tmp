Liz Kendall: I can still win Labour leadership race

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Labour leadership hopeful Liz Kendall says she can win the contest, despite coming last in a recent YouGov poll.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Only she and left-winger Jeremy Corbyn offered "an alternative" to Labour of the last five or eight years, she told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.
She refused to make any recommendation to Labour members for a second preference vote, saying she would "fight to the end" to lead the party.
She has dismissed calls to pull out and back Andy Burnham or Yvette Cooper.
She said: "I do believe I can win. This is not a choice between principle and power, we can have both."
"I think I'm the only candidate apart from Jeremy Corbyn setting out an alternative to what Labour was offering five or eight years ago."
She said ordinary Labour members were "desperate to win, get the Tories out, and make changes" on issues such as low pay and economic inequality.
With 50 days left in the leadership race, she said: "I'm making that case, and I'm going to do that until the end."
At-a-glance profiles of the four contenders
There had been some pressure on Ms Kendall to withdraw and back another candidate in order to defeat Jeremy Corbyn after the publication of the YouGov poll for the Times.
It suggested Mr Corbyn could receive 43% of first preference votes, ahead of Mr Burnham on 26%, Ms Cooper on 20% and Ms Kendall on 11%,.
But the Leicester West MP rejected the idea that she should pull out - with her aides accusing Andy Burnham's and Yvette Cooper's camps of "fuelling" the idea to distract from "their own issues".
The four leadership candidates, and five deputy leadership candidates, will take part in a Labour Party hustings in Warrington later.
Labour is due to announce its new leader at a special conference on 12 September.
