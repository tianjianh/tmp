City, who shocked Chelsea en route to last season's quarter-final, went ahead from Kyel Reid's 18-yard finish before James Hanson's angled strike.
Sam Youngs went close for Chesham, who play in the seventh tier and were 104 places below League One Bradford.
Despite a cameo from Chesham's Barry Hayles, 43, Gary Liddle and Devante Cole scored in injury time.
Chesham reached the second round after claiming their first ever Football League club scalp by defeating League Two Bristol Rovers, one of Hayles' former teams.
But once Reid fired the home side ahead after latching on to Hanson's knock-down, Chesham faced a long afternoon.
Hanson fired in a second after racing on to Lee Evans' long pass to make it 2-0 just before the break.
Second-half substitutes Liddle and Cole flicked in from close range to complete a straightforward afternoon for the Bantams.
Bradford manager Phil Parkinson: "We spoke to the lads about the experience of playing non-league teams last year and and what had to be done to get through.
"We enjoyed the fantastic ties against Chelsea and Sunderland last year, but a lot of hard work had to be done to earn those, and we've done it here.
"If we went back down to Chelsea we wouldn't argue with that. The lads involved and the fans around town are still talking about that cup run.
"They are fantastic memories and they are the reason why we are all professional footballers. Everyone at Bradford is delighted to be back in the hat."
Chesham manager Andy Leese: "We started okay and the manner in which we let in those (first) two goals was a shame because they were so predictable.
"But there are over 100 places between the two sides and that was probably reflected in the score line.
"It was a huge positive for us to reach this round and make history and the finances are incredible, season-changing stuff.
"The excitement of the build-up to this game has been huge and there's a real sense of deflation in the dressing room. We have got a real pick-up job to do."
