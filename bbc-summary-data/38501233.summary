The boss of St John Cymru has said he was "honoured and flummoxed" to be chosen as Japan's official representative in Wales.

Keith Dunn headed an exchange programme with the ambulance group's counterparts in Japan.
And from that link he has just become the new Japanese consul for Wales.
"I had a marvellous time and stayed in touch with them, but really that was the extent of my Japanese knowledge and connections," he said.
"But when the previous consul, Hugh Thomas CBE, stood down last year, the call came to ask me to replace him, and I think I was honoured and flummoxed in equal measure.
"So I wasn't really expecting to have learning Japanese as one of my new year's resolutions."
Consuls are appointed to look after the interests of a country's nationals in Wales, although they do not have to be from that country themselves.
Mr Dunn joins the ranks of 29 other nations to have appointed a consul with particular responsibility for Wales, including Belarus, Canada, France and Kazakhstan.
Chosen by the Japanese minister for foreign affairs, Mr Dunn's responsibilities will include supporting Japanese companies, promoting understanding of Japan, and helping Japanese citizens in times of emergency.
He will also be expected to oversee cultural events and assist the embassy in its mission.
According to the Japanese embassy, there are about 500 Japanese nationals living in Wales, and 4,600 Welsh people directly employed by 25 Japanese companies with many more indirectly reliant on firms such as Sony and Toyota.
Mr Dunn, 60, from Newport, has served with St John since the age of seven, and he is also a member of Newport City Council's Schools Admission and Exclusion Appeals Panel as well as being a Mental Health Act manager for Aneurin Bevan health board.
"Some of my role will be straight forward enough - helping Japanese visitors in times of need, taking the temperature of life in Wales, and reporting back to Tokyo and our embassy in London," he said.
"But another responsibility will be to help arrange official visits to Wales, so I have a lot to learn about Japanese life, customs and language, very quickly indeed."
