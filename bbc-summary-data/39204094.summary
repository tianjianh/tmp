Mark Scott's vertebrae was shattered in a collision with another player during Saturday's match against Basingstoke in Arbour Park.
The Slough Town player said he was "overwhelmed" by the hundreds of tweets he had received from well wishers.
The match was paused for 40 minutes while physiotherapists worked to minimise further injury to his spine.
He was told a sudden movement could have caused instant paralysis.
An operation on Monday fused the footballer's vertebrae and he will be housebound for at least three months.
The money raised in the last 24 hours will compensate him and his girlfriend for missing work.
"I've had hundreds of messages of support," said Mr Scott.
"It's amazing when football goes beyond rivalry and becomes such a community."
The trainee accountant said he would not be able to play football until November after surgeons took bone from his hip and used it to repair his spine.
The 26-year-old said: "I've never heard of anyone breaking his neck [playing] football.
"I was very fortunate. If... there had been no physiotherapists there, I would just have been dragged off the pitch and probably paralysed for life."
Slough Town praised the "professionalism and speed" with which the injured player was treated by both Basingstoke and Slough clubs' physiotherapists.
It said their actions were key in preventing further spinal cord damage.
Mr Scott is expected to make a full recovery.
