The small train came off the tracks at Pembrey Country Park at about 12:30 BST on Thursday.
The Welsh Ambulance Service said an adult and three children were taken to Glangwili General Hospital with injuries, which are not believed to be serious.
Four adults and nine children were treated at the park for minor injuries.
Dyfed-Powys Police said the Health and Safety Executive was due to carry out an investigation.
Carmarthenshire council's deputy leader, David Jenkins, said: "The local authority is extremely concerned to hear about an incident regarding the miniature railway at Pembrey Country Park.
"Our main focus at the moment is on assisting the emergency services; we are not able to comment further on this incident at this stage.
"Whilst the park remains open to the public, we would ask visitors to be sensitive to the situation and allow emergency services to do their job."
