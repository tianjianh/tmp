RBS says it has resolved debit card payment issues that hit NatWest, RBS and Ulster Bank customers on Friday.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Customers had difficulties making debit card payments in shops and online after problems with the RBS card payments system.
An RBS spokeswoman said: "Our debit cards are now working as normal.
"We apologise to those who experienced difficulties this afternoon. No customer will be left permanently out of pocket."
Cash machine and credit card transactions had been unaffected, a spokesman said, adding that the majority of transactions had gone through.
RBS banking customers have had to deal with payments problems in the past.
In June 2015, hundreds of thousands of payments failed to reach the accounts of RBS customers.
And in 2012, RBS Group suffered a widespread IT system failure that led to a Â£56m fine by two financial regulators.
RBS, NatWest and Ulster Bank are part of the same company.
