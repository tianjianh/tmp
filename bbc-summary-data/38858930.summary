The 26-year-old has agreed a deal to the end of the season with the Silkmen.
Haworth joined Barrow in the summer of 2015 following a loan spell and made 16 appearances this season, including the 1-1 draw with Macclesfield in October.
The deal was not completed in time for Saturday's FA Trophy tie against Forest Green, but he could make his debut at Torquay United on 11 February.
