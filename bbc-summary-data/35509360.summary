[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Nottingham Forest's 13-match unbeaten run in the Championship came to an end as they lost at home to Huddersfield.

The Terriers went ahead on 14 minutes when Forest defender Matt Mills turned Tommy Smith's low cross past keeper Dorus de Vries and into his own net.
Forest striker Nelson Oliveira had three good chances to level the scores.
But Philip Billing secured victory with six minutes remaining, scoring his first professional goal with a stunning long-range strike.
Huddersfield had lost their last four games in all competitions but head coach David Wagner inflicted Forest's first league defeat since mid-November.
Oliveira had scored six goals in Forest's fine run but narrowly missed the target with two efforts from the edge of the area before forced visiting goalkeeper Jed Steer to deflect another shot past the post.
Forest had not conceded a goal in their last four league games and Mills was unfortunate to break the deadlock as he failed to clear the danger from Smith's centre.
Huddersfield remain 17th in the table while Forest stay 10th and are now nine points off the play-offs.
Nottingham Forest manager Dougie Freedman:
"Over the last three or four months, we have been playing at our maximum and we need to get back to that.
"We normally press opposition sides in little moments and that is what Huddersfield did very well today.
"It was as good a display as I have seen from an opposition side at the City Ground this season, so we will give them credit for that. But we will bounce back from this."
Huddersfield head coach David Wagner:
"We know we are always able to score goals, we are dangerous as an attacking side and we knew we would have a chance if we could keep a clean sheet.
"But it is one thing to speak about this and it is another entirely to do out there and do it.
"In the second half in particular, this was one of the best performances we have seen since I have been here. All around, we deserved the win and it was a good day for us."
