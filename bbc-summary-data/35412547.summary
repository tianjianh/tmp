Adam John Clifford, 31, from Bristol and Andrew Richard Sigley, 40, from Weston-super-Mare, died in the incident on Feeder Road on Sunday evening.
The car, coming from the direction of Short Street, failed to stop on Feeder Road and drove into the canal.
A spokesman for Avon and Somerset Police praised a man and a woman who jumped in to try to save the men.
Emergency services launched a "complex and challenging" rescue operation but the men were pronounced dead at the scene.
Police said the car failed to negotiate the junction, crashed into the bollards and then entered the canal.
