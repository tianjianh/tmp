[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Repairs to a Moray road damaged in Wednesday's floods are to get under way, the council has said.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The road, which links the village of Dallas with the B9010, is expected to be closed until the middle of next week.
A stretch which was badly damaged will have to be resurfaced.
Moray Council said motorists were advised to take an alternative route via Dallas Lodge and Branchill before rejoining the B9010.
