Strachan was widely quoted by Sunday newspapers saying the 31-year-old defender had taken himself "out of the frame" as an international player.
Hutton has won 50 caps since making his Scotland debut in a 1-0 friendly win away to Austria in 2007.
Scotland play group leaders England in Friday's World Cup qualifier with three points currently separating the sides.
Celtic captain Scott Brown, 31, was included in Strachan's squad for Wembley after the midfielder came out of international retirement.
Though Brown came off injured during Celtic's 3-0 win against Inverness Caledonian Thistle on Saturday, he told BBC Scotland he was fine after suffering a dead leg.
Hutton featured in Villa's 2-1 home win over Blackburn on Saturday.
The defender started his club career at Rangers and has played in England with Tottenham, Sunderland, Nottingham Forest and Bolton. The latter two spells were on loan from Villa, who also briefly sent him to Mallorca on loan.
His last appearance for Scotland was in the March 1-0 friendly defeat of Czech Republic in Prague.
