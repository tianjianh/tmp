Doubt over Caernarfon children's home future

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The future of a residential home for children in north Wales has been thrown into doubt.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Action for Children runs Drws y Nant, in Caernarfon, on behalf of Gwynedd council but it is now under review.
The home offers short-term care to youngsters from troubled backgrounds.
The council has said a combination of factors, including funding cuts, has meant the future of the centre is under review.
