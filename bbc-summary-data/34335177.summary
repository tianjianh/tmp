Aleena Kauser was hit by a white Audi A5 in Bacup Road, Rawtenstall in East Lancashire at about 17:00 BST on 18 September.
She was airlifted to Royal Blackburn Hospital but later died.
In a statement, Aleena's family said: "Our home feels empty and our hearts broken."
"We thank God for blessing us by lending us his angel for nine years."
"During our darkest time we have felt comforted and humbled by the overwhelming kindness and good wishes of friends, neighbours, Aleena's school friends, and the wider Rossendale community."
Two men, aged 22 and 19, arrested on suspicion of causing death by dangerous driving, have been bailed until 30 November.
