About 100 balloons took to the skies over Bristol in the fourth mass ascent of the 37th International Balloon Fiesta.

The wind direction forced balloons to fly low to avoid being blown towards Bristol Airport.
Blue skies and light winds have helped make the four-day event one of the most successful in years, organisers say.
Another mass ascent will take place at 18:00 BST and a nightglow at 21:15.
Jane Oakland, from the Fiesta Committee, said: "This really has been one of the best fiestas we've had."
She said: "We can plan and plan them but the one thing we can't plan for is the weather.
"We've had up to 100 balloons away on the mass ascents - so we're more than pleased."
About 500,000 people are expected to attend over the four days.
Speaking about the wind, flight director Clive Bailey said: "We got very strict with the pilots this morning and they weren't allowed south towards the airport.
"But the airport are fantastic.  Normally you wouldn't be able to fly in that direction but they've let 100 balloons take off as long as we obey the basic rules."
