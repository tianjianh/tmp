Bid to save Cardiff's Meadowbank School from closure

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Supporters of a Cardiff school for children with speech and language difficulties have been protesting against its planned closure.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Meadowbank School in Gabalfa is the only council-run school in England and Wales focusing solely on speech and language needs but has seen pupil numbers fall to 23.
The council is consulting on plans to close the facility in August 2017.
Parents have handed a 3,500-name petition to councillors.
The council said there was a general trend for children with moderate speech and language difficulties to attend mainstream schools.
But parents have argued the school offers specialist support and a secure environment for vulnerable children and claimed the council was not making people aware the school was an option for their children.
Faye Dale's 10-year-old son William has been at the school since he was five.
She said: "I don't think they really understand the complexity of our children's needs. They're just looking at statistics.
"When William went to the mainstream school he said he had friends but they weren't true friends - he just used to play alongside them. He didn't have the social skills or the language skills to make proper friends.
"Now he's got real solid friendships. When he says he's got a best friend - it's a real best friend."
Cabinet member for education, Sarah Merry, said: "I want to reassure all parents at Meadowbank that a final decision will only be made once the consultation has been completed, the results are known and the best interests of all are fully taken into account."
