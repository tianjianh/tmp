[SN]TITLE[SN]
Millwall 3-1 Scunthorpe United

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Millwall kept themselves in play-off contention with a convincing win over fellow promotion hopefuls Scunthorpe, their first win since crashing out of the FA Cup.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Lions had picked up just two points from four games since their 6-0 cup defeat by Spurs, but they got back on track with a victory that leaves them three points behind sixth-placed Southend.
Scunthorpe, meanwhile, remain in fifth, but are just now just four points clear of the Lions after seeing their winless away run extend to seven matches.
Shaun Williams put the hosts ahead when converted an early penalty after Shaun Hutchinson was brought down by Paddy Madden in the second minute.
Millwall should have doubled their lead in 31st minute, Steve Morison finding Jed Wallace at the back post, but the winger's effort went high and wide.
Ivan Toney's half-volley from 25 yards was smartly tipped over the bar by Tom King as Scunthorpe looked for way back into the game after the restart, before Wallace missed another good chance when he blazed over from 12 yards with the goal at his mercy.
However, Millwall got a deserved two-goal lead in 57th minute when Shane Ferguson tapped in Wallace's cross from close range.
Aiden O'Brien then got himself on the scoresheet after 68 minutes with a lovely finish, flicking Tony Craig's teasing ball beyond Joe Anyon to put the game to bed.
Matt Crooks pulled a goal back when he nodded in a free-kick in the third minute of added time, but it was no more than a consolation.
