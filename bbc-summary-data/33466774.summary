He will replace James Naughtie on the presenting team of BBC Radio 4's Today programme.
Robinson will also report and present across television and radio for BBC News and Current Affairs.
He said it was an "honour" to succeed Naughtie and he was "looking forward to hearing someone else's analysis of what our politicians are up to".
"I cannot remember a time when my morning did not begin with Today - the programme - setting the nation's agenda," Robinson said.
"As a child it was the sound not just of the latest news and the sharpest comment but also of my best friend's dad, Brian Redhead, who inspired my love of radio.
"I'm delighted that all these years later I am being given the chance to sit in what was his chair."
BBC director general Tony Hall said Robinson was "tireless and inquisitive, acute and open-minded".
"He has deciphered the coded world of politics with intelligence, clarity and wit," he added.
The BBC said Robinson was taking time off after the coverage of this week's Budget to complete his recovery from surgery he had in March, which successfully removed a tumour from his lung.
He is still undergoing a course of chemotherapy.
Robinson took over from Andrew Marr as the BBC's political editor in September 2005.
During his time in the role he has covered two general election campaigns, the formation of the first coalition in 75 years and the referendum on Scottish independence.
Robinson will join John Humphrys, Sarah Montague, Mishal Husain and Justin Webb on the Today programme.
Naughtie will become special correspondent for Radio 4 as well as BBC News books editor.
The BBC said a new political editor would be appointed "in due course".
