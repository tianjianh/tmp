A taxi driver who attacked a cyclist after waiting for him in the middle of an Edinburgh road with his fists raised has been fined for the road rage incident that was filmed on a head-cam.

Brian Allen, 69, a City Cab driver, is seen having a row with the cyclist on Princes Street and then minutes later waiting for the rider on Regent Street.
The Justice of the Peace Court heard the incident happened on 28 August.
Allen pleaded guilty to careless driving and assault.
He was fined Â£360 and given nine penalty points for careless driving and admonished and dismissed for assault when he was sentenced on Thursday.
Now it is up to Edinburgh City Council to decide whether Allen should lose his taxi licence.
Les McVay, City Cabs company secretary, told BBC Scotland they were supporting Allen "on his past character" - saying he had held a clean licence for 52 years until now.
He said: "I would like to call on the cyclist to post the full unedited version of the footage. The full unedited version shows the cyclist kicking Brian's door and banging on his window. It is quite abusive at the beginning.
"We can all potentially do silly things in the heat of the moment and I don't know what possessed him but we are standing by him because of his character.
"He is very remorseful and knows it shouldn't have happened.
"I don't have the authority to sack him. He will now have to go to the council and they will decide what happens to his licence."
A City of Edinburgh Council spokeswoman said: "'The council was first made aware of the incident on Tuesday when the footage was brought to staff attention and we are now actively investigating."
