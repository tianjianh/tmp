The Maleficent actress works with the United Nations, campaigning about the growing refugee and migrant crisis caused by war in places like Syria.
"They fill my bag with random things," the Maleficent actress told Newsround viewers in a special interview.
"Sometimes I've had to travel and deliver some of the weirdest things - some odd stuffed animal or weird toy."
Angelina has six children with her actor husband Brad Pitt.
"My little ones, like Vivienne, will give me a blanket and tell me I have to find someone to give it to!
"Sometimes they're very practical about what they put - the older they get, they understand what makes sense to give to people."
She says her children have started travelling with her to refugee camps.
"I've never pushed them... they asked and so far Pax and Shiloh have really wanted to go."
Angelina visited refugees in Lebanon, in the Middle East, in March. More than a million people have fled there to escape the war in neighbouring Syria.
"When I brought Shiloh with me to Lebanon she brought this circus stick," Angelina remembers.
"For all my talking, all the kids just wanted to go out and play with the circus stick.
"It's true what they say, an hour of play is worth more than years of conversation."
