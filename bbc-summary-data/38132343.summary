The theatre is working with playwrights Joe Murphy and Joe Robertson, who built a temporary theatre in the Jungle in 2015 named Good Chance Theatre.
Billy Elliot and The Audience director Stephen Daldry has also been involved in the play's development.
The camp, which may have housed up to 10,000 migrants as they waited to reach the UK, has recently been demolished.
A National Theatre spokeswoman said: "Joe Murphy and Joe Robertson, artistic directors of Good Chance Theatre, are working with the NT to develop a play about their experience in the Calais Jungle.
"Together with Stephen Daldry, they led a workshop earlier in the year and the project is now in development in our new work department."
