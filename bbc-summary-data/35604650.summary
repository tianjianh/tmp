[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Kiran Giri reached at least 50mph (80km/h) in a 30mph (48km/h) zone before hitting 47-year-old Jayne Parker, Swansea Crown Court heard.
Ms Parker was hit as she crossed Sketty Lane in Swansea on 10 December 2013.
Giri, 33, of Sketty, Swansea, admitted causing death by careless driving and received an eight-month sentence, suspended for two years.
The court heard Ms Parker, who had a 10-year-old son, died from "catastrophic" injuries just hours after the crash.
She was on her way to work as a chef at the city's Singleton Hospital when she was hit.
Giri had driven less than a mile from his home when he became impatient with a slower driver and then a bus indicating to pull in.
He overtook them both in one go and struck Ms Parker.
Builder Giri denied he was in a hurry on his way to work on a train station redevelopment 40 miles away in Cardiff.
He said: "I was not in a hurry. I was at the speed others do."
The court heard Giri had been caught speeding shortly before the accident and had undergone a speed awareness course as part of his punishment.
Judge Huw Davies said Ms Parker "had lived a good life and had the right to look forward to more".
Giri was also banned from driving for two years.
