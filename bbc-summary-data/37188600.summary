McCann faced Robinson's Dons as a player, most notably in the 2011 League One play-off semi-finals when he scored in both legs of the tie.
Posh play the Dons in a League One match at Stadium:MK on Saturday.
"I think he tried to sign me once or twice before," McCann, 36, told BBC Radio Cambridgeshire.
"He is a young manager, someone I look up to. I see that it's possible, with hard work and dedication, that you can go a long way - and he's doing that."
Peterborough sit one point behind the Dons after four league games and they are set to face each other for the first time since the 2014-15 season, when they both won their home games.
"We've had some good battles with them over the years, it's always a great game," McCann said.
"We want to make sure we go there and get a good performance and a good result."
