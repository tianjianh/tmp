[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Jenny Lewis, from Sherborne, died when the helicopter she was co-piloting crashed into the Atlantic Ocean off the coast of Virginia on 12 June 2002.
She was commemorated earlier with a flypast over Swanage station and the unveiling of a train named after her.
The D6515 diesel locomotive was unveiled as Lt Jenny Lewis RN in memory of the railway enthusiast, who was 25.
The naming ceremony was organised and hosted by Brian Denton, chairman of the 71A Locomotive Group, which preserves locomotives, and the address was given by a senior officer with the Royal Navy's Fleet Air Arm.
The pilot's father Chris and Royal Navy Fleet Air Arm senior officers were among those at the ceremony.
The 71A Locomotive Group's D6515 is a Class 33 diesel-electric locomotive, of which Jenny was a fan.
Mr Lewis said: "I am thrilled about D6515 being named after Jenny and I know that she would be too. Having the locomotive named after my daughter is amazing and Jenny would be so honoured.
"Jenny was a very vivacious girl who worked extremely hard and played hard too. She was very loving and interested in everything - especially mechanical things. If she made up  her mind to achieve something, she put her mind to it and did it."
The 73-ton diesel locomotive hauled London trains to Corfe Castle and Swanage in 1966.
A Lynx helicopter from Yeovilton in Somerset took part in a flypast over Swanage station and the D6515 earlier.
