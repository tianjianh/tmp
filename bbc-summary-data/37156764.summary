PSNI in Twitter storm after 'dry your eyes' tweet

Let's face it - most people use social media in some form to communicate these days.

Many of us can rarely put down our phones, which are filled to the brim with social apps such as Twitter, Facebook and Snapchat.
In recent years, emergency services and public authorities have been getting in on the act too.
Social media applications allow them to share information faster, easier and with a wider audience.
When it works, it does so really well, but it is often the social media blunders and 140-character faux-pas that stick in the memory.
Northern Ireland's Chief Constable George Hamilton apologised to his officers on Sunday, after posting a tweet that appeared to dismiss the pressure under which they work.
He used Twitter to post a video apology, saying: "Last night's frank Twitter conversation was what the police actually do, however, such important issues are not best dealt with in the 140 characters of a tweet.
"I've clearly caused some offence in what I've said, and for that I apologise."
Mr Hamilton isn't alone in causing controversy after posting seemingly offensive comments on social media.
In January, politician Gerry Adams apologised for using the 'N-word' in a tweet comparing the plight of slaves in the United States to the treatment of Irish nationalists.
The tweet was later deleted, but it provoked an angry reaction.
Social media consultant Sue Llewellyn advises users: "Think before you tweet."
"If you mess up, 'fess up and apologise," Ms Llewellyn told BBC News NI. "The worst thing you can do is to either ignore it, or hide it by deleting your tweet."
The difficulty that many people face on social media, she adds, is that humour often doesn't translate well in 140 characters or less.
"You can't really see humour or sarcasm in a tweet, for example, and it can make you look offensive.
"One way to deal with this is to use emojis, or hashtags to add that level of emotion," said Ms Llewellyn.

But if there are so many potential ways to trip up on social media, what makes it worth using?
While users need to be mindful of the pitfalls, the benefits of social media far outweigh the downsides, said Ms Llewellyn.
The Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) have Twitter and Facebook accounts for each policing district - and for the most part, these have proved to be a really effective way of communicating with the public.
In 2015, the PSNI held a 24-hour Twitter event to give people an insight into the everyday work of officers.
More recently, they jumped on the 'Be like Bill' internet meme bandwagon, using the trend to deliver a more serious message.
This approach to social media gives public authorities a "human voice", said Sue Llewellyn.
"It puts a human face on what was once a closed door, it makes what they're doing more transparent."
"I think it's a fantastic way of reaching more difficult to reach members of the public, especially younger people, and speak to them in their own language, on their own terms in their own turf."
That authentic approach seems to be paying off for the PSNI's district social media teams. A battle to be named the funniest team on Facebook has even kicked off between PSNI Bangor and PSNI Craigavon.
The use of well-known memes and behind-the-scenes photos of officers on duty points to a more humorous, approachable side of the police that the public rarely sees.
Some officers have even used social media to stay trendy while promoting safety, with PSNI Bangor asking people to be careful when they are out hunting for PokÃ©mon Go.
The police and other public authorities tend to be regarded with caution, said Ms Sue Llewellyn, so such an approach helps these bodies connect with the public.
"With a light touch and a human voice, the benefits can be enormous," she said.
"A faceless organisation with the right tone can really engage the public in a great way."
But, she concluded: "Think before you tweet, always!"
