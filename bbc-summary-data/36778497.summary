Hain (135) brought up his hundred with a six as he shared a 223-run fifth-wicket partnership with Ambrose (104).
The match burst into life after tea at Edgbaston as the hosts chased an unlikely fifth batting bonus point.
Needing 19 off the 110th over, Keith Barker and Rikki Clarke managed only 17 as the players shook hands at 16:50 BST with the Bears on 398-6.
With both teams in search of little else than bonus points, former England batsman Jonathan Trott was stumped off Gareth Berg early on for 68.
Having scored just 120 runs in his previous 11 first-class innings this season, 20-year-old Hain made the most of the lifeless pitch to reach three figures for the first time in the Championship this year.
Hain's return to form was watched by Ambrose who, despite struggling to get bat to ball early on, reached his fourth successive half-century in Division One.
With 89 required off 11 overs to take maximum batting bonus points, the pair accelerated in the final session with Ambrose hitting three boundaries in four balls off Mason Crane - the third a slog sweep which went the distance.
Warwickshire's wicketkeeper brought up a deserved maiden first-class century this season from 187 balls, but spinner Crane had his revenge as he dismissed Ambrose and Hain in the same over.
With just one over left to collect bonus points, Clarke smashed the penultimate ball off spinner Liam Dawson to the long-off boundary but could only manage four from the last ball as Warwickshire fell two runs short of 400.
