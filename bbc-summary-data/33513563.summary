The three nominations were selected from 180 entries world-wide.
The winner will be announced at a ceremony on 24 August in Edinburgh's Traverse Theatre.
The prize was launched in 2012 when Britain's oldest literary awards, the James Tait Black Prizes, were extended to include a new category for drama.
The shortlisted dramas from playwrights based in Scotland, England and the United States, are:
•Tomorrow Come Today by Gordon Dahlquist, first produced by Undermain Theatre, Texas
•The James Plays by Rona Munro, presented by National Theatre of Scotland, Edinburgh International Festival and National Theatre of Great Britain
•Incognito by Nick Payne, a Live Theatre, nabokov and High Tide Festival Theatre production in association with The North Wall
The £10,000 drama prize is presented by the University of Edinburgh in association with Playwrights' Studio, Scotland and the Traverse Theatre.
Readings of each play will be delivered by professional actors at the awards ceremony, which will be open to the public.
