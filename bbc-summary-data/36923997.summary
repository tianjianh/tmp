[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Welsh Government has demanded clarification that a delay to a new nuclear power station in Somerset will not hit plans for the new Wylfa Newydd plant on Anglesey.

The unexpected setback for Hinkley Point came because the UK government said it wanted to delay its final decision on the project.
It would be the UK's first new nuclear plant in decades.
But Wales' Economy Secretary Ken Skates is concerned about the impact on Wylfa.
He said the UK government has a "responsibility not to damage confidence levels of key developers".
"Any review must not derail the important Wylfa development," he added.
Business Secretary Greg Clark has said the UK government will "consider carefully" the Hinkley Point plans before backing them.
There have been concerns that difficulties with Hinkley Point C's project would affect Wylfa Newydd's ability to attract investors.
Mr Skates said: "Following the UK government's decision to undertake a further review of the Hinkley project I have written to the Secretary of State Greg Clark seeking urgent clarification that this will not impact on the Wylfa Newydd development in North Wales.
"Wylfa Newydd is an important strategic infrastructure project for Wales which will help to create high quality jobs as well as be important to the future of steel in Wales.
"The UK government have an important responsibility not to damage confidence levels of key developers such as Horizon Nuclear Power and their Tier one supply chain to invest in Wales."
The UK government has been asked to comment.
