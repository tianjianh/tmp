[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Manager Steve McClaren says poor game management was the reason for Derby's failure to beat Preston North End.

The Rams conceded an injury-time equaliser at Pride Park on Tuesday, meaning they have won just once in eight games and are 10 points adrift of the Championship play-off places.
"We failed to keep the ball and were just lumping it forward," McClaren told BBC Radio Derby.
"We didn't manage the game very well. We had to keep the ball better."
Derby have 10 games left to reach the top six, starting with an away game against Brighton on Friday evening.
But McClaren, 55, said they should be heading to face the second-placed Seagulls following back-to-back league wins.
"We got the first goal and should have gone on and go the second," the former England boss said. "But we kind of stopped playing and invited pressured and the goal epitomised that. We got punished.
"We had situations when we shot and crossed when we shouldn't. We didn't keep the ball and hoped the final whistle would come.
"We kind of rested on what we had got and that is dangerous at 1-0."
