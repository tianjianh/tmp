Mr Coyle is said to have attempted to kill Paul Sweeney and also attacked Alberto Sanchez to his severe injury and permanent disfigurement.
Both attacks allegedly happened on 15 March, also in the Gorbals.
Mr Coyle is further accused of assaulting Fiona Robertson to her injury in Glasgow's Calton that day.
The incident involving Ms Campbell happened on 17 March.
Mr Coyle faces final charges of attempting to defeat the ends of justice and later punching Stuart Paton at a police station.
