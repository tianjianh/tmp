Dagenham & Redbridge coach Darren Currie told BBC Radio London:
"It's obviously been very tough since (being relegated) on Saturday. You're asking the boys to show a bit of pride in themselves and show a bit of pride in the shirt and that's what gets delivered.
"You've got to want to do better for yourself first and foremost and then obviously the club you're representing."

AFC Wimbledon manager Neal Ardley told BBC Radio London:
"It's always tricky when a team's just been relegated. They had a bit more freedom. In the second half they came out and went three at the back, threw caution to the wind.
"You have to see your jobs through and I thought it was a really professional performance tonight.
"Everything is built on solid foundations and the work-rate of the team."
