[SN]TITLE[SN]
How well are Kent care homes rated?

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Since last October, there have been seven residential care homes rated inadequate in Kent by the Care Quality Commission (CQC).

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A further 20 have been rated as requiring further improvement.
Adrian Hughes, CQC deputy chief inspector, said from 1 April those services rated inadequate would be placed into special measures with a requirement to take action to improve, or face further enforcement.
In a statement, Kent County Council (KCC) said most care homes were privately owned but when concerns were raised about the standards of care provided they would be subject to KCC sanctions.
