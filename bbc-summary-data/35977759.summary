Premier League predictions: Lawro v jockey Leighton Aspell

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
BBC Sport's football expert Mark Lawrenson is pitting his wits against a different guest each week this season.

Lawro's opponent for this weekend's Premier League fixtures is Grand National jockey Leighton Aspell.
Aspell, 39, will ride Many Clouds in Saturday's showpiece race at Aintree, hoping to complete a hat-trick of wins after his triumphs in 2014 and 2015.
Many Clouds could become the first horse to win back-to-back Grand Nationals since Red Rum in the 1970s.
Aspell also won on Pineau De Re in 2014 and is bidding to become the first jockey to triumph three years running.
However, the Dublin-born jockey has not had much success with his football team recently - Aspell has supported Aston Villa since he moved to the Midlands in 1993.
He told BBC Sport: "We are a sorry team this year - one of the worst in Premier League history - and it is sad to see.
"We are going to go down and it could be a while before you see us back up again."
You can hear more tales from Aspell about supporting Villa on Football Focus at 12:10 BST on Saturday on BBC One and the BBC Sport website.
A correct result (picking a win, draw or defeat) is worth 10 points. The exact score earns 40 points.
Last week, Lawro got six correct results from 10 matches, with one perfect score for a total of 90 points.
He beat Jim Glennie and Saul Davies of indie band James, who got four results correct, with one perfect score, for a total of 70 points.
