[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Derry remain fourth in the table after their sixth draw in those eight games, two points behind Bray Wanderers, who drew 0-0 away to Drogheda United.
Derry's final two league outings before the mid-season break are away to Drogheda on Friday and home to Galway.
The Candystripes had beaten Dundalk 3-1 at Maginn Park in the league in March.
Dundalk lie second in the table, 15 points behind runaway leaders Cork City.
The hosts started brightly and visiting goalkeeper Ger Doherty denied Paddy Barrett and Dane Massey in the first half, while Chris Shields fired over the bar.
Derry came into the game more after the break and Ronan Curtis was denied an opening as Gary Rogers raced out from goal to deny the Derry City striker.
Robbie Benson was forced to head off the line after a shot deflected off Sean Hoare, while ex-Derry player Niclas Vemelund slid in to thwart Barry McNamee.
Jamie McGrath curled an effort over as Dundalk responded, then Nathan Boyle hit the sidenetting at the other end.
The final opportunity of the game fell to substitute Ciaran Kilduff, who forced Doherty into another fine save.
