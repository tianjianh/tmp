Massive sinkhole opens up on street in Hertfordshire

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A massive sinkhole has opened up in the middle of a street in St Albans, Hertfordshire, forcing some people to leave their homes overnight.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 66ft (20 metre) diameter hole spread across a front garden and driveway on the street, and is about 33ft (10 metres) deep.
The local Council say five homes had to be evacuated and 20 people were taken to a centre set up nearby.
People on the street said they heard a crash before the huge crater appeared.
Engineers are currently on the street to decide how best to fill the crater in.
No-one has been injured and no homes were damaged.
