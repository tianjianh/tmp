A sell-out crowd in excess of 11,000 will witness the 58th A420 derby at the Kassam Stadium on Saturday.
It is the first league meeting between the two since March 2012, when the U's ran out winners.
"We need to make sure we keep 11 players on the pitch," former U's midfielder Allen told BBC Radio Oxford.
"We have to remain disciplined and do what we normally do. We need to be pumped up but be calm.
"It's the team that deals with the emotions in the right way and stays under control that usually ends up doing quite well on the day."
Michael Appleton's side are unbeaten at home in League One this season, while Town are yet to win away.
Oxford have won each of the last five meetings between the teams but Swindon have won more head-to-head matches.
