Pakistan fast bowler Mohammad Irfan has apologised to fans for failing to report illegal approaches from bookmakers linked to spot-fixing.

Irfan, 34, was banned for a year after an anti-corruption investigation focused on the Pakistan Super League.
He said he did not inform authorities about any approach because he was under mental stress at the time following the death of his parents.
"I was asked to carry out fixes but did not commit any such crime," he said.
"My mistake was not reporting these offers," he told reporters at the Pakistan Cricket Board's headquarters. "I confess and say sorry to the fans. I accept my mistake".
Irfan, who has played Test, one-day and Twenty20 cricket for his country, last appeared for Pakistan in an ODI against England at Headingley in September 2016.
Mohammad Azam, head of the PCB's anti-corruption unit, said the Irfan's admission meant he was not required to appear before a tribunal which is set to hear the cases of four other players linked to the scandal.
He also confirmed Irfan could return from his ban six months early if he fulfils certain conditions, such as attending educational courses.
Internationals Sharjeel Khan and Khalid Latif, who both play for Islamabad United alongside Irfan, have been provisionally suspended.
In February, the PCB announced it was investigating "an international syndicate which is believed to be attempting to corrupt the PSL".
