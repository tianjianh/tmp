Dyfed-Powys Police pair 'offered drug incentive for information'

Two police officers have appeared in court accused of supplying a drug to a person as an incentive to provide information.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Stephen Greensmyth, 54, from Bronwydd, and Rhys Thomas James, 37, from Abergwili, are charged with wilful misconduct in public office.
As well as allegedly supplying the Class B drug, it is claimed they failed to follow correct police procedures.
The men did not enter pleas at Llanelli Magistrates' Court.
The pair, who have been suspended by the force, were released on bail to appear before Swansea Crown Court on 20 June.
The charge followed an investigation by an anti-corruption unit.
