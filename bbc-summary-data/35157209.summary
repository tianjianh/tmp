Gareth Davies: Wales scrum-half signs new Scarlets contract

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Wales scrum-half Gareth Davies has signed a new contract with Scarlets until the end of the 2017-18 season.

The 25-year-old would have been out of contract at the end of this season.
Davies starred for Wales with five tries during their run to the 2015 World Cup quarter-finals after Ospreys' Rhys Webb had been ruled out of the tournament with injury.
"Interest from elsewhere has been flattering but I always wanted to remain here," said Davies.
Davies' deal comes after Wales team-mate Scott Williams signed a contract that keeps him at Parc y Scarlets until 2018.
Centre Williams, 25, was in line for a new national dual contract in which the Welsh Rugby Union would pay 60% of his wages.
But the offer was withdrawn amid an accusation of a bidding war among Wales' regions over Williams, and a dual contract was not offered to Davies either.
Centre Jonathan Davies will return to Scarlets on such a contract from Clermont Auvergne for the 2016-17 season to partner Williams in midfield.
Davies was the top try-scorer with 10 in the 2013-14 Pro12 season, but a knee injury prevented him from building on that the following season.
Webb's injury gave him the chance to shine at the World Cup, though, and alerted a number of clubs outside Wales to his potential availability.
But his decision to stay at Scarlets continues their building work for the next years, with the region recently tempting Rhys Patchell from Cardiff Blues and retaining a number of their Wales internationals.
"Gareth had a very successful World Cup campaign with Wales scoring some good tries," said Scarlets head coach Wayne Pivac.
"But coming back to the region and having to compete for the number nine shirt with Aled (Davies) and Rhodri (Williams) keeps the players sharp and ensures that they're always developing."
