A long-standing sponsor of Chesterfield has withdrawn its support of the club following the signing of Ched Evans.

HTM Products, which had its name on the West Stand of the Proact Stadium, had sponsored the club since December 2009.
Evans, 27, signed a one-year deal with the League One side, despite facing an October retrial over rape allegations.
He was jailed in 2012, but the Court of Appeal quashed his conviction in April. Evans was released in October 2014, and has always denied the charges.
The firm, which had its name on the West Stand of the Proact Stadium, had sponsored the club since December 2009.
"In light of recent events, HTM Products has ceased all sponsorship arrangements with Chesterfield football club," managing director Jon Knapp said on the company's Facebook page.
In a statement following the signing of Evans, club chairman Dave Allen said "a great deal of thought" had gone into the decision.
He continued: "Following the court's decision, we are in no doubt that Ched Evans should be welcomed back into his profession as a professional footballer."
