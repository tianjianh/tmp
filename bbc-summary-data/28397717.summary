John Heald, 53, has been missing since Bei Carter, 49, was found dead on Friday at the Morayland Guest House on Marshall Avenue where he was staying.
Det Ch Insp Matthew Baldwin asked him to "do the right thing."
Mr Heald is also wanted on suspicion of a serious offence in Sheffield on 13 July.
Ms Carter was found dead in one of the guest house rooms late on Friday night.
Humberside Police held a press conference in Bridlington earlier where Mr Baldwin issued a direct appeal to Mr Heald.
"John, I know you were staying at the Morayland Guest House in Bridlington last Friday, the night Bei Carter was killed.
"I need to talk to you about that. I know you left Bridlington soon after the murder and have been back to South Yorkshire.
"It is now time for you to hand yourself in and speak to me about what happened.
"You need to know that you will be treated professionally and fairly by me and given the opportunity to speak to a legal advisor."
Mr Heald, who has been described as "dangerous" by police, has been seen several times in South Yorkshire and officers have urged the public not to approach him.
Humberside Police said he had been spotted in Mexborough over the weekend, as well as in his home town of Rotherham in South Yorkshire.
He is thought to be sleeping rough or staying with friends.
Det Supt Mathew Hutchinson, of Humberside Police, said: "He is a dangerous man and he needs to be found and arrested as a matter of urgency.
"I believe Heald poses a threat to the general public and therefore people should not approach him. If they do see him they should ring 999 immediately."
Flowers and tributes to Ms Carter were left outside the guest house she used to manage.
Neighbour Cheryl Harper said: "She was the most loving person ever. There wasn't a bad bone in her. She was well liked.
"We all want the same thing, we want him caught."
