Two rare Amur tiger cubs have been born at Woburn Safari Park in Bedfordshire.

There are only about 520 Amur tigers - also known as Siberian tigers - left in the wild and 326 in captivity across Europe and Russia.
The two-week-old cubs, who have yet to be sexed, form part of an international breeding programme to protect Amurs which are classified as an endangered species.
They are the first to be born at Woburn for 23 years.
The cubs were born overnight on 17 September to first-time mum Minerva, who turns four this month, and father Elton, also aged four.
Minerva, who keepers said had "taken to motherhood brilliantly", is ranked as the seventh most important female Amur in the captive tiger population as she has few genetic relatives in captivity.
Mother and cubs are being kept in a private den away from the public to ensure as little disturbance as possible, however, they will be allowed out to explore the park's nine-acre tiger reserve early next year.
Minerva and Elton - who also lives at Woburn - were brought together by staff from the European Endangered Species Programme (EEP) as they were considered "an important genetic match".

Jo Cook, from the Amur Leopard and Tiger Alliance, said: "Maintaining a healthy captive population of Amur tigers in zoos and parks is important because they act as an insurance population and can be used for reintroductions should that become a necessary conservation action to support wild Amur tigers."
When the two cubs are old enough they will join Woburn's Amur tigers - mum, dad and another female Neurka, in the "Kingdom of the Carnivores" - a specially designed nine-acre enclosure complete with sleeping platforms and bathing pools - as they are said to be the only big cats that like water.
