BBC News NI looks back at how the fall-out began and how it has developed.
Former senior IRA figure Gerard 'Jock' Davison is shot dead near Belfast city centre.
Police say they do not believe dissident republicans are behind the attack on the 47-year-old, and do not believe his murder was sectarian.
Mr Davison had been linked to the fight in a Belfast bar in January 2005 that led to the death of Robert McCartney, one of Northern Ireland's most high profile killings, but was never charged.
A lone piper leads the cortege carrying his coffin, which is draped with an Irish tricolour and a black beret and gloves, through the Markets area of Belfast before making its way to Milltown cemetery in the west of the city.
The detective leading the investigation into the murder Mr Davison describes the inquiry as "very challenging".
Police say a handgun used in the murder of Mr Davison man in Belfast is "extremely rare" and came from eastern Europe.
A senior police officer tells the BBC Crimewatch programme the gun and bullets are unusual.
Former member of the Provisional IRA Kevin McGuigan Sr is murdered in a gun attack in east Belfast.
Police say he was one of a number of suspects in the murder of Mr Davison.
Sinn Féin denies speculation that the Provisional IRA may have been involved in his murder.
The DUP says there will be "repercussions" if that is the case.
Mourners are told that violence and revenge do not solve problems.
Meanwhile, four men are arrested by detectives investigating Mr McGuigan's murder.
First Minister Peter Robinson warns that Sinn Féin should be expelled from the Northern Ireland Executive if it is proven that the Provisional IRA is involved in Mr McGuigan's Sr's killing.
Meanwhile, Patrick John Fitzpatrick, from the Lagmore area of Belfast, who was arrested in connection with Mr McGuigan Sr's murder appears in court on a firearms charge.
Police say they believe Provisional IRA members were involved in Mr McGuigan Sr's murder, alongside Action Against Drugs, a group consisting of former IRA members, dissident republicans and criminals.
But Sinn Féin president Gerry Adams rejects the allegations, and says the Provisional IRA left the stage in 2005.
Chief Constable George Hamilton says the Provisional IRA still exists, but is not on a "war footing".
After meeting political parties to discuss the murder investigation, he says is is committed to "promoting peaceful, political republicanism".
Gerry Adams tells the National Hunger Strike commemoration in the Republic of Ireland that the IRA "has gone away".
Northern Ireland Secretary of State Theresa Villiers says she is "not surprised" by the police assessment that the IRA still exists.
But she adds there is no evidence it is involved in terrorism.
The Irish Justice Minister Frances Fitzgerald orders a fresh assessment of Provisional IRA activity.
The Ulster Unionist Party announces its intention to withdraw from the Northern Ireland Executive.
Its leader Mike Nesbitt says the decision is based on the police assessment of the Provisional IRA's status and adds that Sinn Féin have "no credibility".
The party executive is to makes a decision on the resignation three days later.
The Democratic Unionist Party says it will move to exclude Sinn Féin from the executive and could bring down the power-sharing government over the claims the Provisional IRA still exists.
Normal business at Stormont cannot continue until the row over the organisation's status is resolved, deputy leader Nigel Dodds says.
