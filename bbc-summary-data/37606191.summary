Exeter head coach Rob Baxter has criticised the England set-up for overloading winger Jack Nowell.

The 23-year-old suffered a significant tear in his quad and is likely to miss the autumn internationals having become the latest player to get hurt during England's training camp in Brighton.
Wasps' Sam Jones broke his leg while Bath's Anthony broke his jaw.
"He was loaded pretty heavily on Monday, far heavier than we would have loaded him with his training," he said.
Nowell had missed the start of the season after having surgery on a thumb injury, and had only made one replacement appearance.
But Baxter was particularly critical of the England medical team for failing to realise the extent of his star player's injury.
"We were told there was no significant injury and England didn't feel it was a big issue, just an overload issue, but when we get him back here and we scan him we find a significant tear of his quad," the former lock added.
"It's not a one or two centimetre tear, we're talking a nine or 10 centimetre tear.
"For that not to get picked up is a bit annoying and now we've realised that he's going to be out for a significant period of time."
Premiership rugby have criticised the timing and intensity of the training camp, which also led to Ollie Devoto and Henry Slade missing training time when they returned to Sandy Park.
Baxter says Premiership clubs must get together with England to ensure this situation does not happen again.
"Injuries will happen, but the amount of injuries that came out of this two-day camp are so significant that if questions weren't asked, it wouldn't just be remiss of us as Premiership coaches, it would be very remiss of England not to ask how all those injuries happened.
"I don't really care if England think they have an unlimited supply of players, that's fine, but there isn't an unlimited supply of players.
"You don't have to have many training camps where you pick up five or six significant injuries before you get through your whole playing group."
