His label, Warp Records, said "with great sadness" that he died last week from complications after an operation.
Bell and bandmate Gez Varley became known as electronica innovators through their act LFO in the early 1990s.
Bell went on to produce Bjork's 1997 album Homogenic and become one of her regular collaborators.
The former Sugarcubes star paid tribute by posting a link to LFO's Love is the Message track on her social media.
The band took their name from the acronym for low-frequency oscillators, synthesiser effects often heard in club music.
Sister Bliss, of dance act Faithless, paid her own homage on Twitter, remembering Bell as "a total legend".
Bell, who was born in Yorkshire, also worked with Depeche Mode on their 2001 album Exciter.
In a statement, his record label said his friends and family "request privacy at this difficult time".
