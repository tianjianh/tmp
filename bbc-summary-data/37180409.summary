The adaptation will be based on the critically-acclaimed first book in the Noughts and Crosses series, set in a dystopian society where black people are the ruling class.
It tells the forbidden interracial love story between Sephy, a "Cross" and politician's daughter; and Callum, a "Nought" and member of the underclass.
The drama is expected to air next year.
Blackman, who was the children's laureate from 2013-15, said she was "beyond thrilled" her book was being dramatised.
"Callum and Sephy seem to have meant a lot to readers over the years and I'm excited at the prospect of watching them on my TV," she said.
The series is being produced by Mammoth Screen, the company behind hit BBC drama Poldark.
The commission was announced at the Edinburgh Television Festival by director of BBC Content Charlotte Moore as part of a new raft of programming designed to "reflect the diversity of modern Britain".
Also announced were three new original drama series and two factual programmes:
