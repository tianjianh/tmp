Gabe McGeown, from the Glenavy Conservation and District Angling Club, said he received a report that slurry had been dumped in the river on Thursday.
He said the club had restocked the river with 900 fish in April.
The Northern Ireland Environmental Agency (NIEA) said it is "currently pursuing a definite lead" and samples have been taken.
