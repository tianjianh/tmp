The TV chef posed with a police poster at Norwich City Football Club, where she is a director.
As reported in the East Anglian Daily Times, she was approached by a fan who said Ms Smith promised to "keep Corrie in her prayers."
Mr Mckeague, 23, based at RAF Honington in Suffolk, disappeared after a night out in Bury St Edmunds on 23 September.
Norwich City fan Sarah Tali Blewden said: "My husband is in the army and I couldn't help feeling that it could have been him or one of his friends and I would want someone to help if we were in that situation.
"I handed-out posters and leaflets at the ground.
"At the end of the game I went up to the directors' box and asked Delia if she would mind having a picture with Corrie's poster.
"She hadn't heard he was missing and seemed genuinely shocked and concerned. She said she would keep him and his family in her prayers."
Mr Mckeague was last spotted on CCTV walking alone and eating fast food in Bury St Edmunds at 03:20 on 24 September.
It is thought he stopped for a brief nap in a doorway before setting off to walk the nine miles (15km) back to the RAF Honington base alone.
His mother, Nicola Urquhart, said she still believes he is alive and made an appeal for information about his whereabouts.
Police said on Friday that a dismembered body found in a suitcase in a lay-by in Derbyshire last week was not that of Mr Mckeague.
