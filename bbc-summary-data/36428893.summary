The 27-year-old missed a chunk of the season with an ankle injury, scoring five goals in 27 league appearances.
The former Kidderminster player spent five months out but returned to help the Robins seal promotion.
Johnson had said he would wait until pre-season to assess him, but a decision was made earlier than planned.
