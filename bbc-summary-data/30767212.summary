Commuters travelling to London Bridge on Southeastern's Charing Cross services must take different routes.
The disruption results from work on north side platforms starting later on Monday.
The rebuilding work is part of the government-sponsored Â£6.5bn Thameslink Programme.
Services to Charing Cross station calling at London Bridge are due to resume in August 2016.
Simon Blanchflower, Network Rail's Thameslink programme director, said: "We realise this will mean big changes to some people's journeys and we have worked with operators across the industry, including Transport for London, to make sure people can plan their new journeys and get to their destinations without extra cost."
Network Rail apologised to passengers for major disruption last week when a new timetable was introduced for Southern and Thameslink trains at London Bridge.
The company said it was reviewing services and had made changes to ease crowding on the station concourse, including new customer information screens and more staff.

Network Rail said the new concourse at London Bridge will increasing passenger capacity by 65% when complete.
At 178 years old, London Bridge is the city's oldest surviving rail terminus.
Network Rail is set to publish an internal report later into Christmas engineering work which overran, leading to the closures of King's Cross and Finsbury Park stations on 27 December, and the partial closure of Paddington station on the same day.
