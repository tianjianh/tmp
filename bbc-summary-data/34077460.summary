Manchester United will play PSV Eindhoven, with Dutch striker Memphis Depay set to face his old club.
Chelsea play Porto, the club Blues boss Jose Mourinho steered to a shock victory in the competition in 2004.
Manchester City face Juventus, Europa League winners Sevilla and German side Borussia Monchengladbach.
Each team will play six fixtures in the group stage, with the first match days taking place on 15 and 16 September.
All four English clubs avoided drawing either defending champions Barcelona, or Real Madrid, who have won the European Cup 10 times.
Borussia Monchengladbach: Finished third in the German league last season. City have been drawn with a Bundesliga team in all five Champions League groups they've participated in.
"Our opponents could not be more illustrious," said Moenchengladbach sporting director Max Eberl. "This is a huge challenge, but we are looking forward to it because we can measure ourselves against the best."
Juventus: Reached the final last season, where they were beaten by Barcelona, and are the current Serie A champions.
"We are Juventus and must not fear anything or anyone," said Juve chief executive Giuseppe Marotta.
Sevilla: Unai Emery's side won the Europa League for the second year in a row and finished fifth in La Liga last season.
Manchester City director of football services Brian Marwood said: "Historically in the previous four years it's been difficult for us to get out of the group because we have had tough draws. This is no different."
Bayern Munich: Pep Guardiola's side won the German league last year and have eliminated the Gunners in two out of the last three seasons.
Munich captain Philipp Lahm told Uefa.com: "It's great we are meeting two old friends, Per Mertesacker and Mesut Ozil, when we play Arsenal."
Olympiakos: All three of Arsenal's Champions League away games against the Greek champions have ended in defeat.
Dinamo Zagreb: The Croatian champions beat Albanian champions Skenderbeu 6-2 on aggregate in a play-off to qualify.
Arsenal club secretary David Miles told BT Sport: "The draw started very ominously but we are relatively happy with it overall."
PSV: Dutch champions and Memphis Depay's former club.
"It is a very tough draw, but also great to play against Manchester United and to meet Louis van Gaal and, of course, Memphis Depay again," said PSV boss Phillip Cocu.
CSKA Moscow: Beat Sporting Lisbon in a play-off to qualify and finished second to Zenit in the Russian Premier League last season.
"I would distinguish Manchester United as a very strong team," said CSKA striker Seydou Doumbia. "Both those games will be spectacular."
Wolfsburg: Won the German Cup and were behind Bayern in the Bundesliga last year. United won both previous Champions League clashes back in the 2009-10 group stage.
"We are satisfied with our draw," said Wolfsburg winger Andre Schuerrle. "The group is tough but it could have been worse."
Porto: Runners-up to Benfica in last season's Primeira Liga, Chelsea have never failed to score in their six previous meetings with the Portuguese club.
"Chelsea are a great team and they have a coach who knows our club and Portuguese football inside out," said Porto coach Julen Lopetegui.
Dinamo Kiev: Ukrainian champions, coached by former Tottenham and West Ham striker Sergei Rebrov.
Maccabi Tel Aviv: Won the Israeli Premier League last season and their chief executive Martin Bain is from Scotland.
Former Chelsea goalkeeper Carlo Cudicini, now a global ambassador for the Blues, said: "This not an easy draw at all.
"I don't think going to Tel Aviv and Kiev are easy trips."
BBC Sport chief football writer Phil McNulty:
"Manchester United have been made very welcome on their return to the Champions League with a favourable draw in the group stage.
"Manager Louis van Gaal will feel quietly confident of progressing, while the meeting with German side Wolfsburg may be made slightly easier if Manchester City sign their stand-out player Kevin de Bruyne.
"No such luck for City themselves, who must wonder who they have offended when it comes to the Champions League.
"Arsenal's group is not easy, with Bayern the main obstacle, but they should have more than enough to get through, while Chelsea and Jose Mourinho will be delighted with their draw."
Ian Dennis BBC Radio 5 live senior football reporter:
"All the English clubs have a realistic chance of going through.
"On paper Chelsea have the easiest assignment. There is no respite for Manchester City, although no-one will relish going to the Etihad Stadium."
Valencia, who beat Monaco in a play-off to secure their place as Spain's fifth representative in this year's group stage, will face Russian champions Zenit St Petersburg, French club Lyon and Gent of Belgium.
Paris St Germain striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic will face his old club Malmo for the first time, as well as Real Madrid and Shakhtar Donetsk.
"He will be welcomed the way he always is when he comes home - like the king of Malmo that he is," said Malmo's assistant coach Olof Persson.
Rank outsiders Astana, founded just six years ago, face twice winners Benfica, 2014 runners-up Atletico Madrid and Galatasaray.
"We're still not ready to play at this level but you can achieve anything when you have a dream," said Astana coach Stanimir Stoilov.
