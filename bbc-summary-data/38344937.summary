The van helping kids to see in schools in India

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
In the UK, wearing glasses to help you see and read at school is perfectly normal and no big deal, but for young children in some parts of India, getting help with eye problems is very difficult.

Parts of the country are very poor, and some families can't afford things like eye tests or glasses, so kids there often go without.
This makes it extra hard for them to study in class as sometimes they can't see what their teacher is writing.
But, a new scheme has been trying to change this.
A special Vision Van has been going to schools in poorer areas in India, doing free eye tests and helping kids to get access to glasses.
