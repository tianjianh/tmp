The actor announced the news on America's Today show saying his daughter would be called Pauline.
Paul Walker died in a car crash in 2013 aged 40 while on a break from shooting the seventh instalment in the Fast and Furious franchise in LA.
"I might never have gone into a delivery room if it wasn't for Paul," Diesel told The Associated Press news agency.
The 47-year-old actor says his part in the child's birth was all because of some advice Walker gave him seven years ago before the birth of his first child, Hania.
"Paul [told] me to go into the delivery room and own it and be present and don't shy away from it and cut the umbilical cord," he said.
"I didn't even know what an umbilical cord was.
"Seven years later, going into the same delivery room, I couldn't help but to have my brain go back and reflect about the best piece of advice that anyone ever gave me.
"When I was cutting the umbilical cord and looking at Paloma, I heard his advice."
He said when it came time to write down the name, his choice had to be Pauline.
Jimenez and Diesel are also parents to a son, four-year-old Vincent.
Paul Walker died when the Porsche he was travelling in crashed into a concrete light pole and two trees in Los Angeles.
A coroner said that the car had been travelling at more than 100mph.
Walker's brothers filled in to complete scenes in Fast & Furious 7.
Furious 7 is out on 10 April and is dedicated to Paul Walker.
