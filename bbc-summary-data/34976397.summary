Nick Payne's Elegy will have its world premiere at London's Donmar Warehouse in April 2016.
His latest play imagines a near future in which advances in medical science have made it possible to extend life.
Payne's previous work at the Donmar, The Same Deep Water As Me, delved into the world of dodgy insurance claims.
The Donmar's artistic director Josie Rourke described Elegy as "a beautiful and moving story about three women... having to make the choice between love and survival".
She told the Evening Standard that she and Payne had discussed the story with doctors and scientists - and also former Archbishop of Canterbury Rowan Williams.
"[The play] raised questions about faith and how religions think about consciousness and science, so I got in touch with Rowan Williams and asked him to read it.
"He had written something for a project that I did at the Bush Theatre and is master of a Cambridge college now, so we went to see him and he was very helpful."
Payne's 2012 Royal Court hit Constellations, starring Rafe Spall and Sally Hawkins, won best new play at the Evening Standard Theatre Awards and transferred to the West End and Broadway.
Joining Elegy in the Donmar's Spring season are Welcome Home, Captain Fox!, a new version of Jean Anouilh's Le Voyageur Sans Bagage by Anthony Weigh.
Directed by Blanche McIntyre and opening in March, the cast includes Francesca Annis, Michelle Asante, Barnaby Kay, Rory Keenan, Katherine Kingsley, Trevor Laird and Fenella Woolgar.
In June, Stephen Dillane and Gina McKee will star in a revival of the late Brian Friel's Faith Healer, directed by Lyndsey Turner.
