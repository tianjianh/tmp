An investigation into whether viewers were tricked into voting for a stunt dog in the Britain's Got Talent final has been launched by Ofcom, the organisation that makes sure programmes follow broadcasting rules.

They received 1,150 complaints after trainer Jules O'Dwyer used a second dog called Chase to perform a tightrope walk because her Border Collie, Matisse, was afraid of heights.
ITV boss Peter Fincham later admitted the programme should have made it clear that a different dog was used.
"We've opened an investigation to determine whether viewers of ITV's Britain's Got Talent final, who may have paid money to vote, were misled about the competition," an Ofcom spokesman said.
O'Dwyer and Matisse narrowly won the final, which was seen by 13 million people.
As well as a Â£250,000 prize, O'Dwyer and Matisse won a spot performing on the Royal Variety Performance.
