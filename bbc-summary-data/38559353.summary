The 24-year-old has made 14 appearances for the Latics since moving to the DW Stadium from fellow Championship club Wolves in August.
The former Tottenham and Swindon player is Addicks boss Karl Robinson's fourth signing of the transfer window.
"Nathan can be phenomenal going forward, is very quick and will add energy to the squad," Robinson said.
