Scotland coach Stuart McCall is looking for "at least a couple" of players to force their way into the national team before World Cup qualifying.

On Thursday, Gordon Strachan's side won the first of four friendlies between now and June, winning 1-0 in the Czech Republic, and face Denmark on Tuesday.
"We hope there will be at least a couple who force themselves in, not to the squad, but the XI," said McCall.
After playing the Danes, Scotland face Italy and France on 29 May and 4 June.
There are six uncapped players in the squad to face Denmark at Hampden, including Brighton winger Jamie Murphy, Leeds United centre-back Liam Cooper and winger Oliver Burke of Nottingham Forest.
Dundee goalkeeper Scott Bain remains with the squad, while Celtic's young full-back Kieran Tierney and John McGinn of Hibernian could also win their first caps.
"It'll be interesting on Tuesday because the lads that have come and had their two training sessions have impressed," said McCall.
"That doesn't mean the lads that have had the jerseys are getting discarded, but we want people to put themselves forward in training and in the games."
David Marshall, who was the first-choice goalkeeper for the failed Euro 2016 qualifying campaign, has had to pull out of the squad with pneumonia.
Craig Gordon and Bain will vie to start on Tuesday, but following Allan McGregor's inspired performance in Prague on Thursday, McCall concedes the number one jersey could be up for grabs in the autumn.
"I don't think there's anyone you could say, 'that's your slot'," McCall said. "The goalkeepers are too good to say we've got a number one and the rest are just back-ups.
"Allan had the jersey for a long time, he was injured and Marsh came in and did terrifically well. There's good competition there."
