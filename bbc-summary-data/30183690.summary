Back in 2011, he teamed up with a friend to start Heel The World - a high-end shoemaking company based in Accra, Ghana.
He gave up his banking job one year later to dedicate himself fully in his new ambitious venture. The young entrepreneur wants to prove that quality shoes can be made in his country.
Heel The World, which currently has 13 full-time employees, has built a website to take orders and relies heavily on social media for marketing.
