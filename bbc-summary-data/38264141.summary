Swansea's board not manager Bob Bradley should be under pressure according to Sunderland boss David Moyes.

Bottom-placed Swans face third-from-bottom Black Cats in a Premier League match on Saturday.
Bradley's side have picked up five points from his seven games in charge with pressure mounting for change.
"If that's the case it shouldn't be Bob Bradley that loses his job, it should be the person who employed Bob Bradley," said Moyes.
"Bob has only been in the job [a matter of weeks]. It must have been the people who made decision, that's the way I would look at it."
Bradley is the first American to manage in the Premier League and the fourth Swansea manager in less than three years.
Chairman Huw Jenkins has said he accepts responsibility for the turmoil in at the club.
Former Everton manager Moyes, who was under pressure himself after a poor start to the season, believes Swansea's plight cannot be blamed on a man who has been in charge for less than two months.
"I think Bob Bradley would have to be given time," he added.
"Whoever would go into Swansea, or Sunderland for example, or some of the clubs at this end of the table and expect it to be a massive turnaround? If anybody thinks that they are completely wrong. They really are."
Bradley has defended himself in the face of criticism, accusing some people of not liking him because of his American accent and claiming some critics are talking "garbage".
Bradley, who succeeded Francesco Guidolin in October, was the first football appointment made by Swansea's new US owners and previously managed Le Havre, Egypt and the USA national team.
