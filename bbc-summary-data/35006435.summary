A consultation period for workers at two closure-threatened Lanarkshire steel plants ends on Friday.

Two hundred and seventy jobs are under threat at Tata Steel in Dalzell and Clydebridge.
First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said the focus of the Scottish government remains "very firmly" on securing an alternative operator for the plants.
Tata said 225 jobs would go at Dalzell in Motherwell and 45 posts at the Clydebridge plant in Cambuslang.
Ms Sturgeon said at First Minister's Questions on Thursday that discussions between Tata and the Community union will continue.
She said: "Tata Steel has confirmed that there are currently serious parties potentially interested in the plants. This is encouraging and we continue to do everything we can to assist that process.
"There are no quick fixes here, there are certainly no easy fixes. But together with the workforce, the unions and with others we are working tirelessly, leaving no stone unturned in our efforts to keep these plants open."
Her comments came in response to a question at Holyrood from Motherwell Labour MSP John Pentland, who asked if she agreed that there is the potential to create a centre of excellence for steel making in Scotland.
Mr Pentland also called on the government to provide for the steelworkers in any transitional period towards that hub of expertise.
Ms Sturgeon responded: "If there is any viable option that will secure the future of these plants then the government will explore taking that forward.
"We do right now have serious parties that are expressing potential interest in the plants. I think it is therefore appropriate and therefore right that we concentrate on doing everything we can to see one of those expressions of interest turn into something real and viable, and that at the moment is where the Scottish government will continue to expend our energy."
Business minister Fergus Ewing also said efforts to secure a new operator for the plants will continue.
Mr Ewing stated a "extensive global search" had been carried out to find a new operator.
Friday marks the end of the minimum statutory 45-day consultation period for workers at Tata.
When it the job losses were announced in October, the Scottish government set up a Scottish Steel Task Force, bringing together key representatives across government and the industry to help keep Dalzell and Clydebridge open.
Mr Ewing said: "The Scottish Steel Taskforce remains focused on finding an alternative operator for Dalzell and Clydebridge and keeping jobs where possible. It will meet again next week to review progress.
"In a hugely challenging global steel market, we want to create the best business environment for any new operator taking on the sites.
"The Lanarkshire assessor will take into account the state of the steel industry for the next business rates revaluation in April 2017, while we are open to options for reducing the rates liability complying with state aid rules.
"We now know that energy costs at the sites could be cut significantly, while there is potential for renewable electricity generation and sale of heat from the plants."
Mr Ewing said the Scottish government will continue to put pressure on the UK government to do all it can do, in particular putting pressure in turn on the European Commission.
Bimlendra Jha, the executive chairman of Tata Steel's Longs Steel UK, said the firm will continue to work closely with affected employees and their trade unions.
He said: "That work will, in this case, continue beyond the statutory 45-day minimum consultation period.
"At the same time, Tata Steel is working closely with the Scottish government and is fully engaged in the taskforce process of finding an alternative solution for the Dalzell and Clydebridge mills."
Steve McCool, national officer at steelworkers' union Community, added: "We will continue to talk to Tata Steel, the Scottish government and all interested parties in the interests of securing a future for the Dalzell and Clydebridge plants.
"As we have said all along, all parties need to work together to ensure that the skills are retained and the assets are preserved to ensure that production has the chance to continue."
In October, Tata said both Dalzell and Clydebridge would be mothballed, while a further 900 posts will go at Tata's facility in Scunthorpe.
The firm blamed the cuts on a flood of cheap imports from China, a strong pound and high electricity costs.
Tor Farquhar, human resources director of Tata Europe, told reporters outside the Dalzell plant at the time that it would be "extremely difficult" to find a new buyer.
The decision to close the two Tata plants in Scotland effectively ends production at the country's last two major steelworks.
The Dalzell Steel and Iron Works opened in 1872, and Clydebridge in 1887.
