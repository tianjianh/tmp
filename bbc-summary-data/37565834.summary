A map of the pylons which will transport power from Wylfa Newydd nuclear power station on Anglesey has been published for the first time.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The route has been produced as part of a consultation into the plant, launched on Wednesday.
The National Grid has also published images of the five metre-wide tunnel to be built under the Menai Strait.
The pylons have been controversial, with campaigners demanding power is  transported by underground cables.
The consultation will run until December 16.
A National Grid spokesman said the new line of pylons are "broadly parallel" to existing pylons across Anglesey and north Gwynedd.
The consultation will also ask people's views on extensions to the existing substations at Wylfa and Pentir, as well as work to the tunnel.
