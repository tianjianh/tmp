Scarlets centre Williams, who has won 47 caps, sees his starting place taken by Dragons' Tyler Morgan amid seven starting changes.
Ospreys lock Rory Thornton makes his debut with uncapped team-mate second row Adam Beard on the bench.
Cardiff Blues scrum-half Tomos Williams could also make his debut off the bench as understudy to Aled Davies.
Cory Allen replaces the injured Alex Cuthbert on the wing, so Ospreys' Keelan Giles must wait until the 2017-18 season to continue his challenge for a Wales cap.
Scrum-half Aled Davies, hooker Ryan Elias, tight-head prop Dillon Lewis and second row Thornton replace controversial Lions call-ups Gareth Davies, Kristian Dacey, Tomas Francis and Cory Hill respectively.

Aled Davies, Elias and Lewis made their Test debut in Wales' win over Tonga in Auckland last Friday.
Open-side flanker Ellis Jenkins takes over from Thomas Young who drops to the bench.
Tour coach Robin McBryde said: "We've heard throughout the week from local people how much Samoa values Wales as a rugby nation, and there's a weight of history behind that.
"That said, we've been reinforcing the message to the players that there will be nothing friendly about Friday's match.

"Samoa will be smarting from their outing last Friday night at Eden Park against the All Blacks [where they lost 78-0 to Steve Hansen's side].
"We've got to be braced for a backlash, a partisan crowd, and look to keep building on the good things we showed in our win against Tonga.
"Training has been hard and the players have been extremely focused, knowing they've got one last chance this season to give a good account of themselves for their country."
Samoa have won four of the nine matches between the two sides, including famous World Cup wins in Cardiff in 1991 and 1999, as well as a comfortable 34-9 victory at home in Apia the last time Wales toured the Pacific Islands in 1994.
The Pacific Islanders make six changes and a positional switch against Wales, with fit-again Cardiff Blues centre Rey Lee-Lo among those coming in.
Lee-Lo will link up with Osprey Kieron Fonotia in midfield.
Bristol wing David Lemi is also back after injury, reclaiming the captaincy from Bath scrum-half Kahn Fotuali'i.
Experienced Toulouse prop Census Johnston is missing for personal reasons, but is replaced by another French-based player in Stade Francais' Paul Alo-Emile.
Wellington Lions player Galu Taufale, 30, makes his debut at open-side flanker.
Other changes bring in D'Angelo Leuila at full-back and Alafoti Faosiliva at number eight, while Bristol's Alapati Leuia switches from centre to wing in place of the injured Albert Nikoro.
