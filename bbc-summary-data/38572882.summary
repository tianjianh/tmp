Jeremy Corbyn's stance on immigration risks giving Theresa May the political cover needed for a hard Brexit, Plaid Cymru leader Leanne Wood has said.

The Labour leader said his party was not wedded to the idea of freedom of movement as he gave a speech in Peterborough on Tuesday.
Ms Wood said she feared he could be helping "make a case for leaving the single market".
However, Mr Corbyn told BBC News he did not think immigration was too high.
Ms Wood said: "The most important outcome for Wales from any negotiations is to be in the single market.
"By upping the ante on migration, Mr Corbyn and the Labour party risk giving Theresa May the political cover needed for a hard Brexit.
"If the speech makes rejecting the principle of freedom of movement a priority, then it will help the Tories make a case for leaving the single market, which would be disastrous for the Welsh economy.
"Labour, despite being the UK opposition, cannot be trusted to know what is best for the Welsh economy."
Tackled on the issue at First Minister's Questions on Tuesday, Carwyn Jones said he believed people would accept freedom of movement in order to work as "perfectly reasonable" if it guaranteed membership of the single market.
