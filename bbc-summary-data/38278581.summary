Birmingham City Ladies: David Parker resigns as manager of WSL 1 club

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Birmingham City Ladies manager David Parker has resigned after seven years with the Women's Super League One club.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Parker first joined Blues Ladies as a youth team coach in 2009.
He was named manager in 2011, working alongside head coach Marcus Bignot, and the club won the FA Women's Cup for the first time the following season.
The 32-year-old helped Blues reach the Champions League semi-finals in 2014, and also led them to the Continental Cup final on three occasions.
Bignot, who had combined his work at the club with his duties as boss of Solihull Moors, left in November after being appointed as manager by Grimsby Town.
"It is a sad occasion personally as the past six years have brought unparalleled success to the club, creating some wonderful memories that will last a lifetime," Parker told the club website.
"A legacy has been built and I hope that continues as the club will always remain close to my heart and it was always a place I could call home with family by my side."
