Ennis-Hill, 30, goes in the final heat of the women's 100m hurdles at 13:59 BST, after compatriot Katarina Johnson-Thompson in heat three at 13:51.
Fellow Briton Jo Pavey, 42, will run in the 10,000m final at 15:10 in her fifth Olympic Games.
Meanwhile, day eight could see a repeat of 'Super Saturday' from London 2012.
On the evening of Saturday, 4 August 2012, Team GB's Mo Farah, Greg Rutherford and Ennis-Hill all won gold in a defining hour of Olympic success for the host nation.
And once again their respective finals all happen within a two-hour period in Rio, in the early hours of Sunday morning UK time.
If he qualifies, Rutherford will be in the long jump final which starts at 00:50 BST, while Farah follows in the 10,000m at 01:25, with the 800m finale in the heptathlon at 02:53.
Day eight will also be Usain Bolt's first appearance of the Games, with the heats of the men's 100m starting at 20:00 BST. The final will be held on day nine at 02:25 BST on Monday.
The Jamaican 29-year-old is hoping to secure the "treble treble" with victory in the 100m, 200m and 4x100m relay.

However, Bolt's compatriot Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce could beat him to three straight Olympic 100m titles.
A champion in Beijing and London, Fraser-Pryce is expected to be in the women's final on day eight at 02:37, but she faces some stiff competition from Dutch World Championship silver medallist Dafne Schippers, and Americans Tori Bowie and English Gardner.
