A blue plaque has been unveiled at the Spennymoor home of "Pitman painter" Norman Cornish.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The artist known for his paintings of the industrial North East lived and worked in the house on Whitworth Terrace for more than 40 years.
Durham County Council, Spennymoor Town Council and the artist's family arranged for the plaque to be installed.
His son John Cornish said the painter would have been "very embarrassed".
Mr Cornish told BBC Tees: "He didn't like publicity at all, he was quite a humble man, he would have been hiding behind the settee somewhere.
"But we are pleased and delighted with the plaque."
Norman Cornish started working in the mines when he was 14 years old, but he was also sketching and painting from a young age and attended the Pitman's Academy for artists at the Spennymoor Settlement.
His son said: "His works portray a real warmth of community, everyday people going about their ordinary lives.
"He really encapsulated a time period."
Norman Cornish died last August aged 94.
