Gerard Bradley, who was 29 and from Ringsend, was buried after Requiem Mass in St Malachy's Church in Coleraine.
He was killed alongside Omagh man Joe McDermott after a concrete slab fell on them both in Perth.
Hundreds of people attended Mr Bradley's funeral.
In his homily, Fr Brendan Mulhall spoke of how one single moment in time had changed the lives of the Bradley family forever.
"In one single moment they found themselves caught up in the middle of a situation that you would not wish on anyone," he said.
"There's always something immensely painful about the death of a young person."
The body of Mr McDermott, who was 24, arrived home on Friday.
His funeral is due to take place on Monday.
