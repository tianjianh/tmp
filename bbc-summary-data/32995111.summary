Creative Scotland launches Scots Scriever language role

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Creative Scotland is funding a writer-in-residence who will produce original work in Scots to raise awareness of the language.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Scots Scriever residency will last for two years and cost Â£50,000.
It is part of Creative Scotland's Scots Language Policy, designed to support the language across the arts.
The policy was unveiled at an event at the National Library of Scotland, which is jointly funding the Scots Scriever role.
The library said it was a "unique type of creative residency" with a "high level" of public engagement. The successful applicant will be paid a salary of Â£15,000 a year for the two years the post lasts.
Culture minister Fiona Hyslop, who was at the launch of the policy, said it was the Scottish government's ambition for the Scots language to be "recognised, valued and used" in public and community life.
"The Scots language is an essential part of Scotland's distinctive culture and heritage, and the Scottish government takes seriously the promotion of the Scots language throughout Scotland in all its regional and local variants," she said.
"In adopting this policy, Creative Scotland acknowledges the contribution the Scots language has brought, and continues to bring, to Scotland's rich culture and heritage, in a country with over 1.5 million Scots speakers."
Writer and Scots publisher James Robertson said: "I hope this policy encourages creative individuals and organisations throughout the land to engage with Scots in all kinds of ways.
"This is not about looking back, whatever the language's past achievements. It is about ensuring that Scots goes forward to be seen and heard in the future."
The Scots Scriever will be expected to produce work in all the variants and dialects of Scots, across all art-forms, as well as raising an appreciation of the language.
