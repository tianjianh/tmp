Jaroslaw Inczewski, 31, of Geneva Road, Ipswich, hit one of the men in South Street in the town who sustained cuts and bruising to his body.
Inczewski, who had denied GBH, was found guilty by a jury at Ipswich Crown Court.
He had admitted dangerous driving and failure to report an accident.
A charge of failing to stop at an accident was ordered to lie on file. The court heard the crash happened on 14 July 2014 at about 21:00 BST.
Det Con Donna Whelan-Smith said: "This was a serious incident in which a transit style van was driven directly at a group of pedestrians.
"This could have quite easily resulted in the victim sustaining broken bones or even have been fatal, and it is pleasing that the sentence reflects the severity of this."
