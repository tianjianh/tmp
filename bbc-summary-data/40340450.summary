Port Vale: Joe Davis & Sam Hornby join League Two club

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
League Two side Port Vale have re-signed ex-Valiants defender Joe Davis from Fleetwood on a two-year deal.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 23-year-old has negotiated his release from League One Fleetwood, where he was still under contract.
They have also signed Burton Albion goalkeeper Sam Hornby, 22, also on a two-year deal - the second keeper to move to Vale Park in as many days.
Hornby, who was offered a new deal to stay with the Brewers, is yet to make his Football League debut.
He spent last season on loan at non-league Kidderminster Harriers.
The double deal takes manager Michael Brown's summer signings to five, following striker Tom Pope and Tuesday's two additions - winger Cristian Montano and keeper Rob Lainton.
Davis, son of former Crewe manager Steve, is the second former Vale player to return to the club so far this summer following the signing of Pope from Bury.
After coming through Vale's youth system, he made 31 appearances prior to joining Leicester City in June 2014.
Having been signed to join the Foxes' development squad, he did not make a first-team appearance for Leicester before joining Fleetwood, initially on loan, in October 2015.
He signed on a more permanent basis in January 2016, but only made eight appearances for the Cod Army last season, playing just 79 minutes of League One first-team football from January onwards.
