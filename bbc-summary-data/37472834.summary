The Brazilian businessman bought a majority shareholding from Peter McGuigan, who was in charge of the Shrimps for 16 years.
McGuigan helped the club to promotion into the Football League and their relocation to the Globe Arena.
"I looked at a lot of clubs around the world, but I always loved English football," said Lemos.
He told BBC Radio Lancashire: "I saw a couple of clubs, but the first choice was always Morecambe as I liked it a lot - the atmosphere, a family club and I hope we can build on the foundations we have.
"You always need to have high ambitions to try and improve so we cannot make promises apart from hard work.
"I believe if you work hard in life you can achieve your dreams, so we can dream."
