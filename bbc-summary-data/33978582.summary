Burton has described himself as "Blackpool Pleasure Beach's biggest fan" and used the seaside town for scenes in his latest film.
He achieved fame through directing blockbusters like Edward Scissorhands, Batman, Planet of the Apes and Alice in Wonderland.
The famous lights will be turned on following a concert on 4 September.
A host of stars will perform including The Vamps, Lawson and Professor Green.
Burton, who was formerly married to actress Helena Bonham Carter, chose to shoot scenes in Blackpool for US band The Killers' video "Here with Me".
His latest movie "Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children" has also brought him to the resort.
Hollywood actor Samuel L Jackson, was one of the cast who featured in scenes filmed on the promenade and inside Blackpool Tower.
He announced his arrival in the town in May by posting a selfie on Instagram.
Councillor Gillian Campbell, deputy leader of the town's council, said: "Having one of the most famous film directors in the world turn on the Blackpool Illuminations is a major coup and shows the high regard the town is held in the hearts of our famous visitors.
"We know he is a huge fan of Blackpool and we are delighted that he has agreed to switch the Illuminations on for us on the biggest night of Blackpool's year.
"This is gearing up to be one of the best switch-on events we have ever had."
