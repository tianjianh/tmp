County Championship: Kent and Essex suffer day one wash-out at Canterbury

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
No play was possible on day one of the final County Championship game of the season between Kent and Essex because of damp conditions at Canterbury.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Overnight rain led first to a delayed start, then multiple inspections, with the umpires abandoning play for the day just after 14:30 BST.
Kent need six points to be assured of finishing second in Division Two.
The visitors have already secured the sole promotion place to the top flight as champions.
