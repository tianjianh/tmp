[SN]TITLE[SN]
Nottingham Forest 2-0 Rotherham United

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Britt Assombalonga scored his first goals since November to push Nottingham Forest to victory against Championship bottom-side Rotherham United.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Assombalonga converted his own spot-kick after he was felled in the box, following a quiet first-half.
Rotherham tweaked things on going behind and took the game to Forest, forcing goalkeeper Stephen Henderson into several crucial saves.
Forest and Assombalonga's second, slid in at the back post, sealed the points.
Much of the focus at Forest in recent weeks has been on off-field matters, notably the bid to appoint a new manager and the unsuccessful attempt to bring former player Nigel Clough back to the City Ground.
The apathy and frustration from the home fans towards owner Fawaz Al Hasawi, manifested in a protest at the last home game against Bristol City, was again highlighted by a season-lowest crowd of 15,770.
However, Rotherham, now without a win in three, were unable to take advantage of the dimmed atmosphere despite some second-half pressure in their efforts to beat the drop.
The Millers are now 12 points behind Burton, who occupy the first spot outside the relegation zone.
In turn interim boss Gary Brazil has won back-to-back home games for Forest, picking up six points from nine since stepping in for the departed Philippe Montanier.
Assombalonga's sharpness is a boost for Brazil, while Ben Brereton - preferred to Nicklas Bendtner and Apostelos Velios up front - impressed on his first start.
Rotherham handed a debut to defender Semi Ajayi following his loan move from Cardiff, but Forest left their new loan signing Aaron Tshibola on the bench.
Forest caretaker manager Gary Brazil: "We scored a good second goal from Britt Assombalonga that allowed us to relax a bit more, but we still had to defend well.
"Stephen Henderson made some good saves, he's in a rich vein of form, and it's another clean sheet for him and the back four.
"Yes, we have some tricky fixtures coming up, but it not easier playing us here either."
Rotherham manager Paul Warne: "That was the worst performance of my tenure. It's the same old story.
"I am hugely disappointed, I wanted to get our away form going. There wasn't much in it in the first half, then to give possession away like we did and let them go 1-0 up five minutes after the restart was a bitter pill to swallow.
"It gave my lads a massive kick in the teeth and our heads dropped. I am trying my best with these lads, but my best isn't good enough."
