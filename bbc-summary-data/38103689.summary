Lifelong restriction for violent rapist Steven Haggerty

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A violent rapist who was convicted of attacks on two women he met through internet dating sites has been given an order of lifelong restriction.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Steven Haggerty, 27, from Hamilton, abused a 27-year-old woman at a house in the South Lanarkshire town in 2012.
He also abused and raped another woman between 26 and 30 December 2014.
At the High Court in Edinburgh, judge Lord Pentland told Haggerty he would serve a minimum of six years in jail but may never be released.
Addressing Haggerty, the judge said: "I formed the strong impression from seeing and hearing both the complainers in the witness box that they were each vulnerable individuals.
"The picture which emerges from your criminal record is of a persistent offender who has difficulty in controlling his behaviour. You have a marked propensity to resort to violence.
"I am entirely satisfied that the risk criteria are met and that an order for lifelong restriction is necessary and appropriate to protect the public from serious harm."
Following conviction, it emerged that Haggerty was convicted of lewd and libidinous behaviour in October 2005 following high court proceedings.
The court heard how the offending behaviour on that occasion related to children who were aged between 12 to 14.
He also had convictions for violence and knife possession.
Det Ch Insp Samantha McCluskey, who led the inquiry into Haggerty, described him as "a dangerous individual who preyed on vulnerable women".
"The two victims in this case were previous partners of Haggerty, who were brave enough to speak out about the serious sexual violence they endured at his hands," she said.
"He is finally being brought to account for his actions, and I hope that this result brings some form of closure for his victims, who have shown real courage in coming forward and going through this difficult process."
