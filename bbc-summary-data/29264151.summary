[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Officials at the referendum count in Glasgow have said they are investigating 10 cases of suspected electoral fraud at polling stations.

It is thought to be related to possible cases of personation, where people pretend to be someone else and cast a vote, then the real person turns up.
The 10 suspect votes were cast at a variety of different polling stations across the city.
Glasgow City Council said police had been called earlier on Thursday.
Each ballot paper has an individual number attached to it, so officials will now have to sort through the ballots and attempt to find these 10 papers.
They will then be removed, and kept separately from the more than 486,000 ballot papers being counted in Glasgow.
Colin Edgar, head of communication at Glasgow City Council, said the search for the ten ballot papers "will not delay the count".
Police Scotland said any crime committed would be appropriately investigated.
A spokesman added: "Police Scotland takes the safety and security of the independence referendum extremely seriously and is working with partner agencies including local authorities to ensure the integrity of the ballot."
