[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
His 1971 book, Open Veins of Latin America, became a classic of leftist political literature in the region.
It chronicles the deep injustices of Latin America and its exploitation by capitalist and imperialist forces.
Mr Galeano's trilogy "Memory of Fire" also received wide praise when it was published in the 1980s.
It is a three-volume narrative of the history of the Americas which starts in the pre-Columbian period and ends in 1980.
He was best known for his book, Open Veins of Latin America, which gained popularity again after the late Venezuelan president, Hugo Chavez, gave it as a gift to US President Barack Obama at the Summit of the Americas in 2009.
Mr Galeano also wrote fiction, essays and journalism and, before becoming one of Latin America's best known writers, had many other jobs.
He worked at a factory, as a bank clerk, a painter and a political cartoonist.
Mr Galeano went into exile when the Uruguayan military took power in 1973 -  first to Argentina, where he founded the literary review Crisis, and then to Spain.
He returned to Uruguay after democracy was restored in 1985.
Local media are reporting that Mr Galeano left a new text to be published after his death, according to the BBC's Veronica Smink in Argentina.
