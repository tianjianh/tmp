Last week Newport appointed ex-Republic of Ireland midfielder John Sheridan as manager following the departure of Terry Butcher.
Feeney, 34, had been in charge of the Belfast club since April 2014.
They finished runners-up to Crusaders last season and currently lead the Irish Premiership by two points.
"I have fond memories of playing in this part of the world, my family home is still in Langstone and I have undertaken my coaching qualifications through the FA of Wales," said Feeney.
"It is also a bonus to be reunited with John Sheridan."
Linfield offered Feeney improved terms on Tuesday evening in a last-ditch attempt to keep him at Windsor Park.
The Belfast club, which had been negotiating compensation for the loss of their manager, now face a task of quickly finding a replacement as they try to regain the league title they last won in 2012.
Newport are currently bottom of League Two having won just one match this season.
Feeney's wife and four children live close to Newport and his new role will result in a significant salary increase.
He played under Sheridan for a period with Plymouth Argyle, and also had spells with Welsh clubs Cardiff City and Swansea.
Sheridan left his role as Plymouth boss last season where he worked with current County chief executive Jason Turner.
Feeney added: "I saw this as the perfect club to return to the Football League with and I look forward to be involved with the first-team on a day-to-day basis.
"The season is still in the early stages and looking at the players the club have at their disposal I am confident that we can negotiate our way off the bottom of the table."
