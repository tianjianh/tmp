[SN]TITLE[SN]

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A former soldier convicted of stealing £13,499 from a betting shop in Inverness in March last year has been jailed for two-and-a-half years.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Karl Jones, 31, stole the money from a branch of Paddy Power the morning after it had taken cash from large bets on an English Premier League match.
He entered the bookmakers through an unlocked staff entrance, his trial at the High Court in Glasgow heard.
Jones, of Liverpool, was jailed at the High Court in Edinburgh.
His trial heard that before the theft on 30 March last year, Jones was in the betting shop up to eight hours a day five times a week.
The jury was told that the bookmakers had taken in a number of large bets for Manchester City to beat Arsenal on 29 March.
But the match ended 1-1 meaning the betting shop avoided big payouts and, as a result, more than £13,000 was in the shop.
