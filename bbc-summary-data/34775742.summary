The current world record holder qualified for the team in September after winning silver at the Shotgun World Championships in Italy.
"It is such a proud feeling to be representing GB at the pinnacle of international sport," he said.
Four of the team will go to Rio having previous Olympic Games experience.
Kneale, however, will be making his Olympic debut having represented the Isle of Man at the Commonwealth Games in Glasgow.
The 33-year-old, who now lives in Somerset, said: "It is so exciting to compete at my first Olympics. I hope I can do myself and Team GB proud.
"It's been a long, tough road but all the hard work has paid off thanks to the support from friends and family, my coach Martin Barker all the staff at British Shooting and my girlfriend."
The GB shooting team are sixth on the all-time Olympic Games shooting medal table with 44 - 13 gold, 15 silver and 16 bronze.
