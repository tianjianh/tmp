Our latest update includes news notifications for rugby union, rugby league and boxing alongside our existing range of sports. With the Six Nations under way, the Super League season on the horizon, and many big fights in the calendar, read on to ensure you don't miss a moment.
Sign up to news notifications in the BBC Sport app and you can have the biggest sport stories and the best content right at your fingertips. Stay in the know by picking from our offering of top headlines, eight major sports and the best from each nation of the United Kingdom.
You can also follow your team from wherever you are with our massive range of event notifications. Across five sports - football, cricket, Formula 1, rugby union and rugby league - we cover every major moment. Line-ups, kick-offs, and half-time scores, goals, wickets, tries and conversions, results and times on the wave of the chequered flag. We currently serve more than 250 teams, with more to come.
The app comes with all our website content along with a radio player, Chromecast integration, a widget and personalised menu options. It's free and easy to download - simply head to the relevant link below:
iOS - Android - Kindle - Windows Phone
For more information on each feature and getting set-up, visit our app FAQ page.
By signing into the website or app, you can create a personalised sport experience.
You might want to add cricket, tennis, athletics and squash - by doing so your My Sport area will display the latest articles and videos from those topics, and also relevant information such as latest scores and results.
My Sport also works across devices, so if you set preferences in the app, they will work on the website and vice versa, as long as you are signed in with a BBC account. To set one up, head here - if you've already got a BBC account you're halfway there.
We've got a live stream and text commentaries for hundreds of sporting events, so how do you choose what to watch? Simply head to the Live Guide and you can see all the available events.
You can also set a reminder for an event by going to that session in the app and hitting the 'set reminder' option. That way you'll ensure you never miss the sports you're passionate about.
BBC Sport are, of course, on Facebook. And Twitter. And Instagram. And YouTube.
Follow us for behind-the-scenes access and exclusive Q&As with sport stars and BBC presenters. And why not follow our range of sport-specific accounts too?
