Britain travel to the Black Sea city of Constanta for the World Group II play-off on outdoor clay on 22-23 April.
They are looking to return to the elite level of the competition for the first time since 1993, but will go into the tie as heavy underdogs.
Britain set up the tie with a 2-1 victory over Croatia in February.
Romania are yet to name their squad, but world number five Simona Halep has already said she will play for her country, who have four other players in the top 100.
Konta, who claimed the biggest title of her career at the Miami Open earlier in April, is the highest-ranked British female at number seven in the world. Watson, at 110, is next.
"Romania have a first-class team and will have home advantage on their best surface. We are very much the underdogs," British captain Anne Keothavong said.
"But we have an excellent team spirit with lots of combined Fed Cup experience and Johanna is playing the best tennis of her career."
