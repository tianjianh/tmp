Flares were thrown on to the pitch and fighting broke out in the stands.
The CFF said a "small group of hooligans" had "stolen joy from Croatian fans and the Croatian team".
Uefa, European football's governing body, has charged both Croatia and Turkey, the latter for incidents during their match against Spain on Friday.
Its control, ethics and disciplinary body will rule on the cases on Monday.
Croatian President Kolinda Grabar-Kitarovic has called for a government session to discuss the fan disturbances and the CFF apologised to those in the stadium for Friday's match, the television audience and the Czech Republic team.
It said Croatia, and everyone connected with football in the country, had been "disgraced by a group of hooligans that hold nothing Croatian sacred".
They had, the statement said, "ruined a beautiful football festival".
It added: "The incident is the product of the passivity of the Croatian state, and we have all become hostages of a group of hooligans.
"We appeal to the Croatian government, and Uefa as well, to join us in the fight against the hooligans, to finally eradicate this evil that wants to cast a shadow over everything the Vatreni present on the field of play.
"Let us start punishing those guilty of a crime, not the victims."
Croatia were sanctioned by world governing body Fifa last month because "discriminatory chants" were sung during friendly matches against Israel and Hungary. They must play their next two 2018 World Cup qualifying games behind closed doors.
Uefa has brought charges for the setting off of fireworks, the throwing of objects, crowd disturbance and racist behaviour by Croatia fans in Saint-Etienne.
Referee Mark Clattenburg halted the match in the 86th minute when flares were thrown on to the pitch from the Croatia end.
When the game resumed, Croatia conceded a late penalty to draw 2-2.
Team manager Ante Cacic called the supporters who threw flares on to the pitch "sports terrorists".
He added: "They are not really Croatia supporters. These people are scary and I call them hooligans."

The Turkish Football Federation, meanwhile, has been charged with the setting off of fireworks, throwing of objects and field invasion after some of their fans caused trouble during Friday's 3-0 defeat by Spain.
Both the Croatian and Turkish federations already face charges in the aftermath of the match between the two sides on 12 June.
Russia were given a suspended disqualification and fined 150,000 euros (Â£119,000) after violent scenes at the game against England on 11 June.
