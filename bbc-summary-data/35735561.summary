Flights at Manchester Airport are back to normal after passengers were stuck inside planes "for hours" on Friday waiting for them to be de-iced.

One remaining flight is still waiting to leave after delays and cancellations caused by snow and ice, an airport spokesperson said.
The airport advised passengers to turn up as normal for their flights.
Passengers on a number of flights said firms had not turned up to clear ice from their planes, creating queues.
Manchester Airport said its staff "stepped in to assist" with the "organisation of de-icing" when a backlog formed and "third parties needed assistance".
It said de-icing was the responsibility of airlines and their ground teams.
A Flybe spokesman said in "exceptional circumstances" like Friday's heavy snow "it is ultimately the airport that directs the priority in which the de-icing rigs should service the aircraft".
An Easyjet spokesman said nine flights to and from Manchester Airport had been cancelled and one flight had been diverted to Liverpool.
"While the circumstances are outside of the airline's control, easyJet apologises for any inconvenience caused," he said.
