Six Nations - Wales v England: Jack Clifford and Jack Nowell start for England

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Harlequins' Jack Clifford will make just his second start for England in one of two changes for Saturday's Six Nations match with Wales in Cardiff.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Clifford, 23, replaces Tom Wood on the open-side flank and Jack Nowell comes in for Jonny May on the wing - with May and Wood among the replacements.
Clifford has yet to start a Six Nations game but head coach Eddie Jones said he "deserves a starting role".
The match will be played with the roof of the Principality Stadium open.
Clifford forms part of an inexperienced back row - the Harlequins man, Maro Itoje and Nathan Hughes have 20 caps between them, while Wales' likely flankers Sam Warburton and Justin Tipuric have 70 and 47 caps respectively.
"He is a hard-working, young player," Jones added.
"He has got a good record against Wales, he had a superb game against them in May, he knows what he is going to expect and we're looking forward to him making an impact in our back-row play.
"Tom Wood will also play his part later in the game off the bench as a finisher."
May started on the wing as England secured a record 15th Test win in a row with a narrow victory at home to France on Saturday, with 23-year-old Nowell on the bench, but the Exeter man has been recalled to win his 20th cap.
"Jack has an excellent work-rate and he's a guy that carries through the line which will be important for us," Jones said.
Wales coach Rob Howley had expected the game to be played under a closed roof but England coach Jones asked for it to be open just minutes before a deadline on Thursday afternoon.

Jones has spoken at length this week about the atmosphere that awaits England at the Principality Stadium.
It is his first visit to Wales in charge of England, who were denied a Grand Slam in 2013 by a 30-3 thrashing.
"Playing Wales in Cardiff is one of the biggest games in world rugby and we're excited," Jones added. "These are the games you want to be part of as a player and coach.
"We don't need extra motivation this week; we play Test rugby because we want to be the best for England. Every game is important for us and our supporters, and Wales is our next game so it's the most important.
"There's always shadows in the corners. They're always there and can always come out but I think the team has moved on.
"Teams go through maturity cycles and to have one of those experiences is a life-changing experience and you never want to go back there."

Wales have named wing George North and fly-half Dan Biggar in their starting XV, with Jones adding that his side will be prepared for whatever is thrown at them.
"We're prepared to win and we're prepared for any shenanigans that might go on - and we're looking forward to it," Jones said.
"They're a cunning lot the Welsh, aren't they? They always have been. They've got goats, they've got daffodils, they've got everything. Who knows?"

In the absence of injured brothers Mako and Billy Vunipola, England's pack looked short of ball-carriers against the French, and Eddie Jones has addressed this by bringing in Clifford, in the hope his dynamism with the ball in hand will outweigh his inexperience.
England's replacements - or "finishers" as Jones calls them - made a big impact against France in the final quarter, and more of the same will be expected in Cardiff, with James Haskell amongst those being held back on the bench.
