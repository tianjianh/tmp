The service for the 74-year-old, who died earlier this month a few days after having a stroke, was held at St Peter's Church in Bournemouth.
Stewart's broadcasting career spanned more than five decades.
Fellow DJ Mike Read, actress and singer Anita Harris, and comedian Bobby Davro were among the congregation.
Former snooker player John Virgo also attended.
The service, which was led by the Reverend Dr Ian Terry, included the hymns Amazing Grace and Lord Of The Dance, as well as the song You'll Never Walk Alone.
There was also a farewell address by the Grand Order of the Water Rats - an entertainment industry fraternity - of which Devon-born Stewart was a member.
A private cremation followed the church service.
Dr Terry said the service would "celebrate the life of somebody who just loved life".
"It's a service of thanksgiving for Ed who, through the radio and through the television, gave enjoyment and fun," he added.
Stewart started out as an announcer, film critic and rugby reporter with Radio Hong Kong.
He was one of the first presenters on Radio 1 when it launched in 1967, and a Radio 2 presenter for 15 years - during which he broadcast from the summits of Ben Nevis and Snowdon, Mount Vesuvius volcano in Italy, and also from the Falkland Islands.
On television, Stewart went on to become a regular Top of the Pops presenter in the 1970s and was best known for children's favourite Crackerjack, which he hosted from 1973 to 1979.
He was also a longstanding presenter of children's show Junior Choice, which was last broadcast on BBC Radio 2 over Christmas.
On it he coined his trademark catchphrase: '''Ello darling."
Stewart is survived by his two children, Francesca and Marco, and four grandchildren.
