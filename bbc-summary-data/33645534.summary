Norwich roads boss in 'emotional' welcome for city's 20mph limit

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
What does Norwich have in common with Edinburgh, Bristol, The City of London, Paris and Barcelona? The answer is that by next spring they will all have a blanket speed limit of 20mph (32kph) in their city centres.

Norwich is the first place in the region to slow down the traffic on every road in the centre and there was a sense of history being made as the vote was taken by the city council's highways committee.
"This is quite emotional for me," admitted committee chairman, Steve Morphew. "I remember 15 years ago using the phrase '20's plenty' during a campaign in Norwich. These things take time but its moment has finally arrived."
The decision to impose the limit on every road within the inner ring road, widen footpaths and install speed bumps across the city centre had cross party support.
Conservative county councillor Nigel Shaw said: "I have been pushing for 20 mile an hour limits on these roads since 2002. It is going to make the area much safer for pedestrians and cyclists."
Local Green Party councillor Simeon Jackson said: "This will be appreciated by residents who don't want to block access to the city centre but want a better quality of life."
At the same time a series of new cycle paths are being put into the city centre.
According to Rod King of the campaign group '20's Plenty', 20% of the country now has 20mph speed limits and he says a number of other towns and cities are considering blanket speed limits in their centres.
"Our culture is changing," he said. "I think there's a growing acceptance that 20mph is the right limit on residential streets. 70% of drivers support it and it makes such a difference to the general ambience of a town centre."
Although Cambridge and Ipswich have significant 20mph zones not all of their centres are covered by the limit, Norwich is to have the first blanket ban.
In a consultation carried out by Norwich City Council, 67% of those who responded welcomed the proposals.
"I hope it gets even more people out of their cars and cycling responsibly," said one respondent.
"As a driver I find it confusing to have a mix of 20mph and 30mph zones. It would be much easier to have the whole centre at 20mph," said another.
But those who objected worried that the move, which is costing Â£400,000, will deter people from entering the city and they questioned if the new limit would be properly enforced.
"I cannot see the need for a 20mph limit," complained one resident. "You are spending money for the sake of it."
Another added: "What is this fixation with cyclists  - there are other users in the city?"
The vice chairman of the highways committee, Bert Bremner, accepted not everyone would be happy but he said there would be benefits for drivers.
"As a motorist, I have no problem with this," he said. "I can cruise along at 18mph and see my miles per gallon dial go up. This is fantastic news."
Rod King from '20's plenty' is currently overseeing 270 campaigns in towns and cities across the country to reduce speed limits.
"Attitudes are changing," he said. "It's excellent what's happening in Norwich and I think it won't be long before other places in the east follow suit."
