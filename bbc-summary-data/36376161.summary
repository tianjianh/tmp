[SN]TITLE[SN]
Lord Sugar re-hired as government enterprise 'tsar'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Apprentice star Lord Sugar has been appointed as the government's enterprise tsar.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Downing Street said the Amstrad founder would be touring the country, championing enterprise and encouraging firms to take on more apprentices.
Lord Sugar previously held a similar role under Gordon Brown's Labour government.
Last year he said he was quitting Labour because of his "disillusionment" with the party.
The businessman said he was "delighted" at his latest appointment, adding that "not enough of our young people know about apprenticeships and what they offer, and too few feel empowered to set up their own business".
Skills Minister Nick Boles said Lord Sugar had "huge credibility among young people".
