A Snapchat journey in the Philippines

Election fever has hit the Philippines, set to vote in a new leader next week. Heather Chen, the BBC's social media producer in Asia, is in the capital, Manila, and providing daily updates on Snapchat to cover the psychedelic sights and other election highlights.

From the incredible heat to rainbow jeepneys on chaotic roads, even cute Askals - that's the local term for street dogs who roam the roads everywhere you turn - there is always something in Manila to be snapped.
I'll be giving a glimpse of what is catching my eye as the country gears up for the 9 May general election.
I couldn't resist snapping a token plane wing picture as we circled above Manila's Ninoy Aquino Airport. I finally found a legit use for that Snapchat speed filter!
Are you keeping up with the 2016 Philippine election?  It is a lot less painful and more fun than it is to keep up with the Kardashians.
For starters, the name of the leading yet controversial presidential candidate Rodrigo Duterte is everywhere, on rubber wrist bands and even car decals.  You just can't escape him.
The other presidential candidates - Grace Poe, Miriam Santiago Mar Roxas, Jejomar Binay - also have very loyal followings.
Who will lead the Philippines?
But before I even got to the Philippines, there was Mr Duterte election paraphernalia.
"He speaks his mind, that's why we Filipinos lean towards him - we want someone to fight against empty promises and corruption," said Jay, an electronics salesman proudly showing off his red and blue rubber wristband before flying to Manila from Singapore.
And touching down in Manila, Mr Duterte's name is everywhere.
Getting a taste of life for Manila natives, whiling away their time in a jam from the airport into Makati city, I spotted two vehicles sporting Duterte car decals.
It's a sign he is set for the presidency," said driver Raymond, with a laugh.
"He's already with us in everyday life - our traffic jams. One with the people."
We will of course be looking out for every kind of supporter and voter over the next week.
