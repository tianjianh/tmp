French-owned AXA has announced up to 56 posts could go at its base in Ipswich.
It said the changes are part of a restructuring programme and the separation of commercial and personal business lines.
The 56 posts at risk include 27 in management. Affected staff have been informed and the company said it will redeploy people where possible.
In 2009, 120 posts among the 1,600 workforce at Ipswich were lost when the company said it need to "build a stronger and more efficient business for the future".
