Weeping Window is part of Blood Swept Lands and Seas of Red, created to mark the World War One centenary and was originally at the Tower of London.
The Hull Maritime Museum display ended on 14 May and marked the centenary of the Oppy Wood battle on 3 May 1917.
The Hull Pals' battalions had more than 200 men killed on that day in France.

The museum, once the port's Dock Offices, was also specifically chosen to highlight the sacrifices made by the Merchant Navy, especially the city's trawlermen.
Each poppy in the original display at the Tower of London represented one death in the British forces during the 1914-18 war, a total of 888,246.
The poppies will end a UK tour in 2018 and have a permanent home at the Imperial War Museum..
The sculpture was in Hull from 25 March to 14 May as part of the tour and the UK City of Culture 2017 celebrations.
Weeping Window will next be at The Silk Mill in Derby from 9 June.
