It is the first professional contract for the former Bristol Rovers trainee.
"When my agent told me that Forest Green were interested I was totally thrilled," Davies told the club website. "I can't wait to get started."
Forest Green - who finished second in the National League in 2015-16 - gave a first senior deal to 18-year-old striker Olly Mehew last Thursday.
