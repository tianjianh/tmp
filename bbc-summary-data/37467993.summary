[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Joe Hart helped Torino secure back-to-back home victories in Serie A as they held on to beat Fiorentina.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Iago Falque put the hosts in front after 15 minutes as he burst clear down the right and picked out the bottom corner with a left-footed strike.
The striker then turned provider, sliding in Marco Benassi to finish one-on-one against Ciprian Tatarusanu.
England keeper Hart saved Borja Valero's deflected strike but could not prevent Khouma Babacar's late header.
The win follows last week's 3-1 victory over Roma as Torino extended their unbeaten run to four games.
Elsewhere, AC Milan fought back from 3-1 down to beat Sassuolo 4-3 thanks to three second-half goals, including a stunning volley from 18-year-old Manuel Locatelli.
