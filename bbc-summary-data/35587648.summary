The incident was caused by a leaking pipe which was in the the ceiling above a bedroom in a hospital ward.
The patient was moved to another room following the leak.
The Southern Trust has apologised for what it has described as a 'distressing' incident.
Esther Gishkori, Southern Trust Director of Acute Services, said: "We have recently replaced many of the old pipe fittings in the hospital with new fittings. This incident was caused by a blockage of the old sewage pipe work scheduled for replacement in the coming weeks.
"It is planned that all the sewage pipes in the main hospital block will have been replaced by 31 March," she added.
It is understood that repair work began in September 2015.
