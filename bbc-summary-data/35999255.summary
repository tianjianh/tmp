Welsh election: Ask the Leader - Lib Dems

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Welsh Liberal Democrat leader Kirsty Williams faces questions from an audience in Aberystwyth in the third of a daily series of live TV election specials.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Bethan Rhys Roberts hosts Ask the Leader on BBC One Wales at 19:00 BST on Wednesday.
Kirsty Williams has been a member of the Welsh Assembly since it was created in 1999 - at 28, she was one of the youngest AMs elected.
After the 2007 election, she successfully opposed her party entering into a so-called rainbow coalition with the Conservatives and Plaid Cymru in Cardiff Bay.
The episode caused divisions in the party - which she ended up leading some 18 months later.
Early on in her leadership Ms Williams launched Project 31 - a plan which would see the Welsh Liberal Democrats aim to win a majority of seats in Cardiff Bay.
However, in her only assembly election campaign in charge so far - 2011 - the Lib Dems lost one of their six seats, and polls suggest they have a fight to keep the rest this time around.
Despite leading the smallest party in the assembly, Ms Williams can take credit for getting Welsh Labour ministers to deliver Lib Dem policies such as increased school funding for poorer pupils as part of a deal to support the government's budget.
Her reputation as a party leader may be enhanced - but the biggest challenge for Kirsty Williams is making sure that there are enough Lib Dem AMs re-elected to ensure that she has a party group to lead for the next five years.
Thursday 14 April - Plaid Cymru leader Leanne Wood in Aberystwyth
Friday 15 April - Welsh Labour leader Carwyn Jones in Llangollen
Monday 11 April - Welsh Conservative leader Andrew RT Davies in Swansea
Tuesday 12 April - UKIP Wales leader Nathan Gill in Swansea
Ask the Leader can be seen on BBC One Wales at 19:00 each day and on the BBC iPlayer.
