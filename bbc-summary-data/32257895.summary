Anderson, 32, had West Indies' Denesh Ramdin caught at first slip on the final day of the first Test in Antigua.
The seamer, who began the Test on 380 wickets, was mobbed by his team-mates as his family celebrated in the crowd.
Ramdin's departure left West Indies 294-7, but Jason Holder's unbeaten 103 helped them secure a draw.
Lancashire's Anderson, who made his Test debut in 2003, has helped England win three Ashes series and rise to the top of the Test rankings in 2011.
All-rounder Botham took 383 wickets in 102 Tests between 1977 and 1992, as well as scoring 5,200 runs at an average of 33.54.
Anderson bettered Botham's tally in two matches fewer as England pressed for victory at the Sir Vivian Richards Stadium in the first Test of the three-match series.
Having taken two wickets in the first innings, he had Marlon Samuels taken at gully midway through the morning session to move level with Botham.
But he had to wait until an hour of play remained before he located Ramdin's edge, removing the West Indies captain for 57 courtesy of a smart catch by Alastair Cook and ending a seventh-wicket stand of 105.
Anderson said: "Taking over from an English legend is a hugely proud moment for me.
"I love taking wickets for England. You pick up milestones along the way and it was a huge landmark for me picking up 100 Tests this week."
Botham, commentating on Sky Sports, said: "I couldn't be happier. I've enjoyed watching him bowl; he richly deserves it.

"He's a magnificent performer. When you are a swing bowler you've got to learn how to do it, and the ball he got the wicket with was a terrific delivery."
Asked how many wickets Anderson could take before retiring, Botham said: "He can do 450 easily."
Former England captain Michael Vaughan told Test Match Special: "What a bowler Jimmy Anderson has been for England - a joy to watch throughout the years."
Former England all-rounder and Lancashire team-mate Andrew Flintoff told BBC Sport before Anderson broke the record: "He's an England great at the minute. However, he could play for another three years and end up being one of the world's great Test cricketers."
Ex-England pace bowler Darren Gough, who took 229 Test wickets, said: "Well done Jimmy. Truly deserved, a genius."
Former England wicketkeeper Alec Stewart said: "Huge congratulations to Jimmy on becoming England's leading Test wicket taker. Brilliant achievement. Next target 500 wickets please."
