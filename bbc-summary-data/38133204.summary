Bollywood actress Shilpa Shetty is trending on Indian social media for her literary reviews, after suggesting Animal Farm be used to teach children about caring for animals.

George Orwell's 1945 novella Animal Farm is actually a dystopian allegory for the rise of Stalinism.
In the novella, an animal revolution results in the rise of a corrupt elite.
Twitter users responded with the trend #ShilpaShettyReviews - summarising books with guesswork from their titles.
Shetty was reacting to Harry Potter's inclusion on the national school syllabus in India, and suggested other books she thinks should be included.
"I think having books like Lord of the Rings and Harry Potter as part of the syllabus is a great move because it cultivates imagination and creativity at a young age," she told the Times of India.
"I think books like Little Women would also encourage respect towards women at a young age."
"Even a book like Animal Farm should be included as it will teach the little ones to love and care for animals," she added.
The quote has since been removed from the online version of the article, but social media users have already shared photographs of the print edition.
Shilpa Shetty is also well-known in Britain for her appearance, and eventual win, on Celebrity Big Brother. She was the subject of a race row which prompted international reaction.
The television programme Big Brother is named after the antagonistic national leader from another George Orwell novel, 1984.
Shetty has yet to respond to her latest trend-setting activity.
