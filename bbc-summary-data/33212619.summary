The County Antrim-born musician, 52, has pulled out of the band's US tour while he receives further treatment for Hodgkin's Lymphoma.
He said on Facebook: "I'm saddened by the fact that my cancer has returned.
"However, I'm beyond consolation that its return will prevent me from being able to do my job for a while."
He added: "I'm still working on a schedule of treatment with my doctors, but I will see you all very soon."
The guitarist, who has also been a member of Whitesnake, Dio and Thin Lizzy, revealed in June 2013 that he was undergoing chemotherapy.  Several months later, he said his cancer was in remission.
Originally from the Maze just outside Lisburn, he joined Def Leppard in 1992.
