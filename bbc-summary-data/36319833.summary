Former Wales midfielder Trollope, 43, had been part of Slade's coaching team since February 2015.
Slade was removed as manager of the Championship club at the end of the season and has taken up a new role as head of football, in which he will oversee scouting, among other duties.
"We have to be ambitious and create a belief within the club," Trollope said.
"The target is the play-offs and hopefully promotion."
Trollope, in his new role in charge of the first-team, will not report to predecessor Slade.
Cardiff missed out on the Championship play-offs after winning just once in the final seven games of the season and eventually finished eighth.
"There are areas that need addressing within the team and we will be looking to add quality and also the right people," added Trollope.
"I had no reservations, it is a good club with a good fan base.
"Every coach has own philosophies and way of doing things. I have clear ideas what I want. I will bring my own style to that. Anyone who knows me will know that."
Malaysian businessman Vincent Tan is prioritising style and promotion.
In a statement on the club's website he said: "I believe Paul will improve the team in several areas. In particular, I hope he will lead the team to play an attractive style of football that Cardiff City fans love.
"We hope that under Paul's leadership, Cardiff City will return to the Premier League.
"I'd like to thank him for what he's done for us so far whilst wishing him the best of luck for the future. He has our full support."
Trollope, who spent five years as manager of Bristol Rovers, is a member of Chris Coleman's Wales coaching team.
He confirmed he will continue in his role at this summer's European Championship finals in France next month.
"I don't see it as any sort of hindrance for preparation for new season [with Cardiff]," he said.
"I will discuss the viability of continuing with Wales after the Euros."
The ex-Derby County and Fulham player was first-team coach at Birmingham and Norwich before joining Cardiff midway through the 2014-15 season.
Slade had been in charge at Cardiff City Stadium since October 2014, leaving Leyton Orient to succeed Ole Gunnar Solskjaer.
He was in charge for the final time when Cardiff drew 1-1 with Birmingham on the final day of the season.
