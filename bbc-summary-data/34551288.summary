Manuel Pellegrini: Man City boss unhappy at Belgium head coach

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Manchester City boss Manuel Pellegrini is "not pleased" with Belgium head coach Marc Wilmots for playing captain Vincent Kompany on Tuesday.

Defender Kompany, 29, has missed City's last five matches with a calf injury but played 58 minutes as Belgium beat Israel 3-1 in a Euro 2016 qualifier.
Kompany limped off in City's 2-1 defeat by Juventus on 15 September.
"We sent Vincent with a medical report saying he cannot play," said Pellegrini.
"The national squad have all the rights to do what they want."
Pellegrini would not confirm if Kompany will start for the Premier League leaders against Bournemouth on Saturday (15:00 BST).
He missed league matches against West Ham, Tottenham and Newcastle, a Capital One Cup tie against Sunderland and a Champions League match against Borussia Monchengladbach.
"If a player withdraws from a national team squad, he cannot play for his club in the next game," added Pellegrini.
"Vincent didn't play in our last few games and some day clubs will protest that it should be the same thing the other way.
"It's no problem with Vincent. It was just important for him to work a whole week before playing a game, but he couldn't because he played with Belgium.
"We can just make a suggestion with a medical report and they decided he could play."
Meanwhile, striker Sergio Aguero is out for a month because of a hamstring injury.
Midfielders Fabian Delph and David Silva and full-backs Gael Clichy and Aleksandar Kolarov will all miss City's home game versus Bournemouth.
