The documentary category also features Meru, Something Better to Come and The Hunting Ground - Kirby Dick's film about rape on college campuses.
Amy broke UK box office records for a British documentary in July this year.
It featured previously unseen footage of Winehouse, who died from alcohol poisoning in 2011, aged 27.
Amy, which screened at the Cannes Film Festival in May, also earned $8.3m (Â£5.49m) at the US box office, making it one of the country's top 25 grossing documentaries of all time.
British director Kapadia conducted more than 100 interviews with 80 people - including friends, family and colleagues of the star, although her father, Mitch Winehouse, has since distanced himself from the film.
Kapadia previously won a Bafta for his 2010 documentary film Senna, about Brazilian Formula 1 champion Ayrton Senna.
Competition comes from The Look of Silence, Oppenheimer's second film about the 1960s Indonesian genocide. It follows a Bafta win and Oscar nomination for 2012's The Act of Killing.
This time Oppenheimer focuses the story on an optician who confronts the men who killed his brother.
Meru, documenting the first ascent of a dangerous peak in the Himalayas, is also nominated, alongside Something Better to Come, Hanna Polak's film which tells the story of a young girl who lives in a massive garbage dump outside of Moscow.
The winner will be announced on 23 January at the Producer's Guild of America ceremony in Los Angeles.
The awards have a good record of predicting which film will go on to win the Oscar's best picture category, however the rest of this year's nominations will not be revealed until 5 January.
This year British producer David Heyman - best known for the Harry Potter films, Gravity and Paddington - is among those being presented with special honours, alongside Gray's Anatomy and Scandal showrunner Shonda Rhimes.
