[SN]TITLE[SN]
Coventry City 2-0 Chesterfield

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Coventry City's revival continued at the expense of Chesterfield, as the Sky Blues stretched their unbeaten home record to 14 matches.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
On his 86th appearance, team captain Jordan Willis scored his first league goal before substitute Andy Rose made it two in two with nine minutes left.
But Lewis Page's 93rd-minute red card, for a second bookable offence, took a little of the gloss off the night for City, who climb to 18th in League One.
Chesterfield, who suffered a seventh straight defeat, had one outstanding chance to go in front after 21 minutes when Willis produced a tremendous block to deny Ched Evans.
But, after Evans had again gone close in the second half, interim Sky Blues manager Mark Venus made a double change on 67 minutes, bringing on Rose and Ruben Lameiras for Marcus Tudgay and Jodi Jones.
Venus also switched formation from 4-4-2 to 4-3-3. And, within two minutes, Willis pounced from a corner after Rose's header was not cleared.
Rose himself made the points safe when he swept home from 15 yards following Page's left wing cross.
The game was watched by Coventry's lowest home league crowd of the season - 7,941 - with sporadic chanting in protest against owners SISU.
