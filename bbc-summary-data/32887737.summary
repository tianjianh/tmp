Welsh duo Alex Cuthbert and Adam Jones join the South African in a line-up captained by Ireland's Shane Jennings.
He leads a side containing nine different nationalities with 466 international appearances between them.
It includes his Leinster team-mates Zane Kirchner and Jimmy Gopperth, Toulon's leading try scorer David Smith and former All Black Joe Rokocoko.
Head coach Robbie Deans will be in charge of the Barbarians, the famous invitation club celebrating its 125th anniversary this year.
Leinster and Ireland flanker Jennings retires from the professional game this summer after a career in which he has won 13 caps for Ireland, Pro12 and European Cup titles with the province and an Aviva Premiership title with Leicester Tigers.
"It's an honour to lead out such an illustrious team. It's a great highlight in my career and we'll be determined to do the Barbarians' jersey justice against Ireland," said Jennings.
Lions tight-head Jones anchors a scrum containing a powerful second row combination in Uruguay's Rodrigo Capo Ortega and Georgia's Konstantin Mikautadze.
Japan's Ryu Koliniasi Holani is a dynamic number eight from Deans's club side Panasonic Wild Knights.
Ireland have named a 27-strong squad, dominated by Leinster and Ulster players, for the Limerick encounter.
