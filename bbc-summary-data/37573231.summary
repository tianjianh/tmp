Lawro's opponent for this week's Premier League fixtures is Strictly Come Dancing star Ed Balls.
The former shadow chancellor, who is chairman and lifelong fan of Norwich City, is also tipping the Canaries to beat Rotherham in the Championship.
"Will we win? Of course," he told BBC Sport.

You can make your own predictions now, compare them with those of Lawro and other fans, and try to take your team to the top of the leaderboard by playing the new BBC Sport Predictor game.
A correct result (picking a win, draw or defeat) is worth 10 points. The exact score earns 40 points.
In the round of games before the international break, Lawro got four correct results, including one perfect score, from 10 Premier League matches. That gave him a total of 70 points.
He was beaten by comedian and actor Elis James, who got six correct results, with three perfect scores, for a total of 150 points. James finished joint-bottom of last season's guest leaderboard (below) with 10 points but he is top of the table so far in 2016-17.
