Streets will be pedestrianised, new trees and plants added, and public art and cycle routes installed.
A University spokesperson said the work would make the campus more welcoming, safer and greener for everyone to use.
The scheme, funded by Sheffield City Region Investment Fund and the University, is due to be finished by the new academic year in September.

The public courtyards around the Arts Tower and Western Bank concourse will be improved, with a new public park created near Broad Lane.
New pedestrian and cycle crossings will be made, and existing ones improved.
Keith Lilley, director of estates and facilities management, said the development would "transform the campus environment and support the University's links with the city centre."
"We want to encourage the people of Sheffield to enjoy and use our campus whether it's to have lunch in one of our cafes, cycle through the campus area up to Weston Park, or just enjoy sitting and relaxing in one of the new greener, safer places that will be created through this development."
The university is providing £5.1m for the work, with £2.9m from Sheffield City Region Investment Fund.
Sheffield City Council's Leigh Bramall said: "Our universities are critical to the future of Sheffield and vital to the successful economic growth of the city."
He added the new campus would "emphasize the University's position as a key driver in the local economy."
