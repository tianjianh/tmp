Rotherham United 2-2 Bristol City

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Bobby Reid's late equaliser saw Bristol City come back from two goals down to draw at Rotherham United.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Izzy Brown opened the scoring for the hosts from close range after capitalising on a defensive mistake.
Aden Flint then scored an own goal, diverting Greg Halford's shot into the net, before Tammy Abraham reduced the deficit from close range.
But with just six minutes remaining, Reid tapped in to secure a point for City.
The Millers went ahead in calamitous fashion as Flint and his keeper Richard O'Donnell clashed to allow Brown to steal the ball and fire into an empty net.
And the day went from bad to worse for Flint, who then turned Halford's weak attempt into his own net via the post and crossbar.
But after Danny Ward fired over for the hosts, City fought back as Abraham found the net following a goalmouth scramble.
Reid then stretched to nudge the ball into the net from a yard out and ensure the two sides shared the spoils.
Rotherham manager Alan Stubbs:
"I can understand the frustration of the fans after the game, but there has to be some realism.
"The Championship has become an even harder league and it is harder to compete, you are fighting an uphill battle.
"When you look at the bigger picture this could be a valuable point. We were playing a good team who have spent this summer.
"We had chances to make it three and that's the difference. At 3-0 you go on to win the game."
Bristol City manager Lee Johnson:
"We have come back from 2-0 down and are still disappointed, which is a great positive.
"You could look at it and think a draw is a good result. I wanted to win. Concentration and communication has killed us with the goals we've conceded.
"Both goals were poor to concede, these things do happen and I'm not going to label blame anywhere and will focus on the positives.
"We could have been demoralised, but we kept going and kept believing."
