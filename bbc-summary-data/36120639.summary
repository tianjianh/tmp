Jordan Owens' 32nd-minute goal earned Crusaders a 1-0 win over Coleraine.
Kevin Braniff recovered from an earlier bad miss to net in the 65th minute as Glenavon won 1-0 at the Oval.
Two Aaron Burns goals set up Linfield's 4-0 win over Cliftonville as Paul Smyth and Ross Gaynor were also on target.
With Crusaders having clinched the title on Tuesday night, Saturday's contest at Seaview lacked intensity at times but, as has been the case so often during the season, Stephen Baxter's side were able to graft out the result.
After Coleraine's Jamie McGonigle tested Sean O'Neill early on, Owens put the champions ahead on 32 after good work by Paul Heatley.
Winger Heatley rattled the Coleraine crossbar before half-time and while McGonigle struck the Crusaders woodwork in the second half, the champions held on in the closing stages with little difficulty.

Braniff somehow managed to blaze over from two yards out in the 54th minute at the Oval but atoned 11 minutes later as he cut inside and fired past Elliot Morris.
Both sides created first-half chances with Curtis Allen denied by Johnny Tuffey and Jay Magee going close for the Glens, with Ciaran Martyn and Andy Hall having Glenavon efforts and Joel Cooper testing Morris.
Brilliant work by Hall appeared to have set up a certain goal for Braniff nine minutes after the resumption but the striker somehow contrived to scoop the ball over the bar.
However in typical fashion, Braniff recovered from the miss to fire in the winner which secured Glenavon's European spot in advance of next month's Irish Cup final.

Linfield recovered from a sluggish start to earn a comfortable victory over fading Cliftonville at Windsor Park.
David McDaid missed a great early Cliftonville chance with Martin Donnelly also going close for the Reds before also hitting the Linfield woodwork.
However, Reds keeper Conor Devlin's mistake after he fumbled a Ross Gaynor cross gifted Burns his opening goal in the 34th minute.
Burns doubled Linfield's lead on 49 after Cliftonville had failed to clear a Paul Smyth cross.
Smyth then ran straight through the Reds defence before firing in the third goal on 63 and Gaynor netted from the spot on 77 after Smyth had been felled in the area.
