Rankin will miss Ireland's forthcoming one-day matches against Pakistan, South Africa and Australia as well as the Intercontinental Cup and Twenty20 games against Hong Kong.
The 32-year-old fractured his left tibia during a training session.
Ireland will not replace the paceman in their squad for the games against Pakistan at Malahide.
"It's obviously a blow to lose a bowler of Boyd's quality and experience at such a crucial juncture of the season, but these things happen in sport," said Cricket Ireland head coach John Bracewell.
Rankin, who has taken 308 wickets in 92 first-class matches, was injured on his Test debut for England against Australia in January 2014 in Sydney.
"It's extremely frustrating to lose Boyd during such a key point in the season," said Warwickshire director of cricket Dougie Brown.
"He will now go through a rehabilitation programme with our medical team to rest, strengthen and be ready for our 2017 pre-season schedule."
Meanwhile, England all-rounder Chris Woakes has been released by the England & Wales Cricket Board to play in Warwickshire's One-Day Cup quarter-final against Essex at Edgbaston on Wednesday.
The 27-year-old was named England's player of the series against Pakistan after taking 26 wickets and scoring 177 runs in the four Tests.
