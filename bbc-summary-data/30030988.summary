It follows a report warning that Welsh pupils' number abilities are "at best average" at over half the schools inspectors visited last year.
Despite improvements, Estyn says too many pupils struggle with the basics.
The minister said schools need to ask themselves honest questions about the issue and how to address numeracy.
As a result, Mr Lewis said he was organising a conference of maths teachers to be held in the new year.
In an interview with BBC Wales, Mr Lewis said: "We need a greater sense of urgency from schools.
"It really is time now for head teachers in particular to ask themselves very honestly: 'Is my school operating well enough in terms of that whole-school numeracy policy or do we need to apply some urgent attention to this?'."
Improving numeracy is an education priority for the Welsh government and it introduced the National Numeracy Programme in 2012.
Since its introduction, the Welsh government has also introduced:
While the situation is improving, there are still too many pupils struggling to use basic number techniques such as division, Estyn said.
Inspectors have been looking at the effectiveness of numeracy strategies to gauge how far schools have made progress since the first baseline survey last year.
Estyn's chief inspector, Anne Keane said: "Pupils' numerical reasoning skills are generally not strong enough and this is something that we see too often in school inspections and thematic work.
"Staff need more support to widen their knowledge and understanding of strategies to help pupils to use numeracy across the curriculum."
