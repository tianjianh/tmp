At least 3,300 people have been confirmed killed in the country's worst earthquake in more than 80 years.
The quake had a magnitude of 7.8 and tremors were felt in nearby Pakistan, Bangladesh and India.
Many countries and charities from around the world have offered help to Nepal to deal with the disaster.
Cities of tents have popped up in Nepal's capital city Kathmandu.
People who are too afraid to return to their homes, or have nowhere to go, are being sheltered there.
"We don't have a choice, our house is shaky," said shopkeeper Rabi Shrestha in an interview with AFP news agency.
Rescue helicopters are heading out to Mount Everest to help 210 stranded climbers down.
The UK is sending a team of experts to help Nepal deal with what has happened.
Their priority is to reach people who are trapped and injured, and provide shelter and protection to those who have lost their homes.

Many countries, including America, Pakistan, China and India, have promised aid like food supplies, tents, doctors and search and rescue helicopters.
The search continues to find survivors from the earthquake, but rescue efforts have been made harder because many mountain roads are cracked or blocked by landslides and rubble.
It's also meant access to remote areas is difficult.
