The incident happened on Townhall Street on Friday.
The NI Ambulance Service (NIAS) said five people were taken to the South West Acute Hospital in Enniskillen.
The NIAS said the incident involved a car and four pedestrians - their injuries are not believed to be life-threatening.
William Prescott, whose wife owns a restaurant which is located close to the scene of the crash, described what had happened as a "freak accident" and said "everyone had been shocked".
"I'm just happy and relieved that no-one was seriously injured or killed," he said.
"The town was choc-a-bloc in the aftermath of the crash but the road has re-opened and things have returned to normal."
Mr Prescott said a construction firm was currently working to board up the window of Boots.
BBC News NI's Louise Cullen, who is at the scene, said a building control officer was at Boots assessing the damage.
Police have appealed for anyone who witnessed the accident to contact them. Townhall Street was closed for a time but has reopened.
