Star Wars fan offers B&B; in Southampton 'shrine' home

A huge Star Wars fan says he has spent about £150,000 on turning his home into a shrine to the sci-fi franchise.

Dave Oldbury's semi-detached house in Southampton features memorabilia including toys, posters, books, action figures and life-size Storm Troopers.
He is now offering other Star Wars nuts the chance to stay for £35 per night.
The postman, 46, bans indoor lightsaber use while a path at the side of the house, which "leads to the dark side", has been declared strictly off-limits.
Mr Oldbury said: "I have lots of stories to share from hanging out with my heroes and I look forward to giving my guests the inside scoop."
His home, in the Sholing area, is filled with about 3,000 Star Wars items, which he has collected since he was eight years old.
He said: "My first figure was Chewbacca, the rest quickly followed because I had to have them.
"Later in life I progressed into autographs, merchandising and meeting the actors.
"It's my passion and I really enjoy it."
Dave Oldbury's house rules:
He cannot even fit his whole collection into his house - the garage serves as a spillover area for 500 pieces.
Mr Oldbury has also collected nearly 9,000 cast and crew autographs after travelling the world to meet the film's stars, including Sir Alec Guinness.
Despite citing Han Solo as his favourite character, he has adorned his body with tattoos of Obi-Wan Kenobi and Darth Vader.
He has put his Star Wars-filled guest room, dubbed the Solo Suite, up for rent before next month's UK cinema release of Star Wars: The Force Awakens.
He said: "We have a room set up full of Star Wars memorabilia, so you go to bed dreaming of Star Wars and you wake up looking at Star Wars.
"I look forward to showcasing my collection to fellow Star Wars fans.
His added his ideal guest would be actress Carrie Fisher dressed in her slave Princess Leia outfit, but acknowledged that was "not going to happen".
