David Miller murder trial: Homeless man 'petrified' during attack

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A homeless man accused of killing a man in his own flat was "petrified" when the attack was carried out, a court has heard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The body of David Miller, 56, was found at his home in Northampton last June.
Ian Cuthbertson, 49, Michael Hallett, 37, Joseph Catlin, 30, and Zena Kane, 35, all of no fixed address, deny murder.
The court heard Mr Cuthbertson had gone to the flat for "a bath, a change of clothing and to watch TV".
Mr Miller had been stabbed multiple times and crude attempts had been made to destroy his body during the attack at Patterdale Walk, Boothville, Northampton, on 14 June 2016.
He had been partially-dismembered.
Summing up at Northampton Crown Court, prosecutor Peter Joyce QC said the defendants had acted like "a pack of wolves".
He said the only possible verdicts were guilty of "murder, murder, murder, murder".
He told the jury: "It is not argued that what happened to David Miller wasn't murder.
"The question is whether one or all of these four defendants took part."
He called the killing of Mr Miller "a team job", saying that was why none of the accused had given evidence during the trial.
Mr Joyce dismissed a statement to police by Mr Cuthbertson - in which he denied he had been at the scene - as "lie, after pathetic lie, after pathetic lie".
He also accused Ms Zane of "crocodile tears" and "hypocrisy".
Solicitors for all four of the accused are due to sum up their defences on Monday.
The case continues.
