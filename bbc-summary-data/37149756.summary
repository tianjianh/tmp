The Low Moor Munitions Company, in Bradford, was destroyed when a fire triggered a series of explosions, on 21 August 1916.
Among those killed in the tragedy were six firefighters.
During the service at West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue headquarters a memorial to the victims was rededicated.
Chief fire officer Simon Pilling said: "It was a devastating event that took the lives of 40 people and injured up to 100 others.
"We felt it was fitting to mark the centenary here at fire service headquarters as we've been able to relocate the statue from Scholemoor Cemetery to here, where we have renovated and restored it."
Among those attending the service was David Crosby, from Vancouver, whose grandfather, Knighton Pridmore, was one of the firefighters killed in the explosion.
The Low Moor site produced picric acid to colour carpets, but it was converted into a munitions factory during World War One.
An exhibition marking the centenary opened at Bradford City Hall on Friday.
