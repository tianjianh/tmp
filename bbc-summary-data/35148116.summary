[SN]TITLE[SN]
Newport County 1-2 Plymouth Argyle

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
League Two leaders Plymouth fought back to deny former manager John Sheridan's Newport County a point at Rodney Parade and open a three-point gap at the top.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
County led at half-time after Scott Boden lobbed goalkeeper Luke McCormick following Lenell John-Lewis' flick-on.
But Jake Jervis' close-range header turned the tables three minutes after the break as Argyle took control.
Newport held out until Ryan Brunt had time to turn and fire in left-footed 20-minutes from time.
The Exiles - who are 29 points and 19 places behind Plymouth - rallied, but Mark Byrne was twice denied by McCormick.
Newport manager Sheridan told BBC Radio Wales: "The biggest downer for me, again, is giving the lead away. I thought we played well in the first half and deserved the lead.
"We should have more points from the last few games we've played, but I'm not making excuses - we've got to know how to see games through.
"We've played a team who are top of the league and I thought we were the better team - their best player was their keeper (McCormick)."
