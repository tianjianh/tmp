Officers searched five properties in the city on Tuesday after information was supplied by Slovakian authorities, Northumbria Police said.
Three Slovakian men aged 19, 30 and 36 and a Slovakian woman aged 55 were arrested on suspicion of trafficking people into the UK for exploitation.
A number of victims have been taken to safe locations, the force said.
The raids were part of a UK-wide operation coordinated by the National Crime Agency.
Those arrested were later bailed pending further inquiries.
