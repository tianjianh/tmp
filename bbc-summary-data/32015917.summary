A member of staff at Glenshee Ski Centre alerted SAIS to the slide on Glas Tulaichean, a 3,448ft (1,051m) Munro.
SAIS Southern Cairngorms said the full depth avalanche was filled with mud, rocks and large blocks of snow.
Another large slide was recorded at Creag Meagaidh in February.
The Sportscotland Avalanche Information Service (SAIS) provides avalanche hazard information reports for walkers, climbers and skiers from December to early April.
The service covers hills and mountains in Lochaber, Glencoe, Creag Meagaidh, Southern Cairngorms, Northern Cairngorms and Torridon.
