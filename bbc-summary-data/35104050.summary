Huddersfield Giants have transfer-listed England prop Brett Ferres.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 29-year-old was suspended last month "pending an internal investigation into behaviour away from the club".
He helped England to a Test series win over New Zealand in November, having made just 13 Super League appearances in 2015 because of injury.
The club said his suspension has been lifted and he has been disciplined "in line with club policy".
