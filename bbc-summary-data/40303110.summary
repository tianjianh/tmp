[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Winchester Crown Court heard it was a "miracle" that the victim survived the attack in Bournemouth in January.
The 17-year-old, who cannot be named for legal reasons, was convicted of wounding with intent and possessing a knife following a trial in May.
He also admitted supplying heroin and crack cocaine.

The court heard the victim, a man in his 50s, had approached the teenager in Ashley Road shortly after being refused drugs because he lacked money.
The boy, described as a "career drugs dealer", plunged a small knife into the man's head behind his ear.
CCTV shown in court showed the victim walking into a shop with the knife still embedded to a depth of 3.5cm, before he collapsed.
In a victim impact statement, read in court, the man said he was convinced he would die in hospital during the operation to remove the blade.
Judge Jane Miller QC said the blade had "missed critical structures in the head by millimetres".
She told the teenager: "You are very lucky you did not face a murder charge.
"You are dangerous and lack ability to control yourself."
A jury previously cleared the defendant of a charge of attempted murder.
