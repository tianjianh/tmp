The 51-year-old ex-Everton, Manchester City and Bradford City winger punched Zarah Blake while angry and drunk, his trial heard.
Beagrie, of Killinghall, North Yorkshire, was sentenced to a 12-month community order on Tuesday.
He said he intended to appeal against his conviction.
In a statement following the hearing at Skipton Magistrates Court, Beagrie said: "I am innocent, something I have maintained from the outset; that is why the verdict was so devastating.
"I will be appealing."
He said he was still with Ms Blake, adding: "This has been an upsetting and traumatic time for us and we both feel there is no other alternative but to appeal."
The court heard he punched his partner during an argument in Harrogate in April.
A Sky Sports spokesman said: "When we first became aware of the charge, we removed Peter from our coverage pending his case.
"Following the outcome we have terminated his contract with immediate effect."
