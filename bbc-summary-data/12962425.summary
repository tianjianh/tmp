[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Weston-super-Mare's Grand Pier has been named Pier of the Year 2011.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The tourist attraction re-opened in October last year, two years after fire destroyed its pavilion, having undergone a Â£39m transformation.
It was given the accolade by the National Piers Society. Eastbourne, Southend and Swanage tied for second place.
Weston's pier is the first to have won the award twice, having first been given the honour in 2001.
The award is voted on by the society's 650 members.
A spokesman for the society said: "The replacement pavilion is altogether on a grander scale and incorporates many breathtaking rides as well as facilities for conferences and presentations."
Nineteen other piers received at least one vote for this year's award.
The Grade II-listed pier at Weston first opened in 1904.
The first pavilion was destroyed in a fire in 1930 and, two years ago, an electrical fault caused the second fire.
