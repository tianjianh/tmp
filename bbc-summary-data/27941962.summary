The Edinburgh band picked up the award and Â£20,000 at a ceremony in Glasgow's Barrowlands on Thursday.
They beat Biffy Clyro's number one UK album Opposites and Edywn Collins' Understated to the prize.
The Scottish album of the year, similar to the Mercury Music Prize, acknowledges "the most outstanding albums" released by Scottish artists in the past 12 months.
Young Fathers said:  "What started in the basement has become worldwide.  Something that is personal to us, is for everyone."
Other bands on the shortlist included Chvrches, Mogwai and Boards Of Canada.
Stewart Henderson, chairman of the Scottish music industry association, said: "I'd just like to say how delighted we are for Young Fathers.
"Tape Two is an extraordinary album and a deserving winner out of a phenomenally strong shortlist."
