It took the Gunners just six minutes to open the scoring as Walcott headed in from Alexis Sanchez's cutback.
The two Arsenal men linked up again as Englishman Walcott drilled low into the net to complete a swift team move.
Basel goalkeeper Tomas Vaclik made good saves to deny Sanchez and Hector Bellerin, with Birkir Bjarnason coming close for the visitors.

Arsenal stunned rivals Chelsea 3-0 in the Premier League at the weekend and impressed again at the Emirates in this Group A encounter.
Arsene Wenger's side are now unbeaten in eight games in all competitions since losing to Liverpool on the opening day of the season.
The sublime skill and movement of attacking trio Sanchez, Mesut Ozil and Walcott, who already has five goals this season, was too much for Basel to handle and the margin of victory could have been far more emphatic.
Santi Cazorla controlled the tempo of the game with 94 passes - more than any other player on the pitch - while centre-backs Laurent Koscielny and Shkodran Mustafi were largely untroubled.
Arsenal often start a season strongly before falling away, but if they can avoid major injuries and maintain a settled side, realistic challenges for the league title and the latter stages of the Champions League are not unthinkable.
Arsene Wenger has been in charge of Arsenal for 20 years - but who would be in the greatest XI to play under the Frenchman?
Manager Wenger has again been linked with the vacant England national team job after Sam Allardyce left the post on Tuesday. The 66-year-old reportedly turned down an offer from the FA before Allardyce's appointment in July and he may receive a call again.
He celebrates 20 years in charge at Arsenal on Saturday, overseeing an era in which the club has won three Premier League titles and six FA Cups.
But he has underachieved in the Champions League, reaching the final in 2006 but going out in the last 16 for the past six seasons.
Wenger's contract runs out at the end of the campaign and should he fancy a crack at the England job, success in Europe's premier club competition would be the perfect way to sign off.
The Xhaka brothers, Granit of Arsenal and Basel's Taulant, faced each other again after crossing paths at Euro 2016.
In a quirk of international eligibility, Granit represents Switzerland while Taulant plays for Albania and it was the Gunners man who came out on top on that occasion.
And it was the younger Xhaka sibling who triumphed again as his side totally outplayed the Swiss league champions.
Midfielder Bjarnason, part of the Iceland side that beat England at the tournament in France, had a long-range effort tipped over by David Ospina, who also saved well from Andraz Sporar late on.
Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger: "I would say the game was of quality and the win was comfortable. The only regret was that we did not score enough tonight considering what we created. Overall, some excellent football.
"We need to have the desire to improve and not be happy with what you have. You have to have the urgency and focus high. We have not won anything and the target is to get stronger."
Arsenal will look to keep up their excellent form when they travel to Burnley in the Premier League on Sunday, 2 October (kick-off 16:30 BST).
