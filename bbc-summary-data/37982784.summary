[SN]TITLE[SN]
Bolton Wanderers 1-0 Coventry City

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Zach Clough netted his sixth goal in eight starts, but high-flying Bolton were made to work hard for their League One win over Coventry at the Macron Stadium.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Clough's 11th minute lob gave Wanderers a perfect start and the visitors were then indebted to Lee Burge for keeping them in the contest.
The City keeper saved from Gary Madine, Josh Vela and Clough on a night when former Bolton player and coach Gary Speed was honoured with a minute's applause by fans.
But if Burge excelled in the opening period, opposite number Ben Alnwick came to the Trotters' rescue in the second.
Having already denied Kyel Reid before the break, Alnwick saved superbly from Lewis Page plus substitutes Jodi Jones and Ruben Lameiras.
Bolton's best moment of the second half was Clough's 25-yard free-kick, which was tipped on to the post and away to safety by the outstanding Burge.
Coventry poured forward in search of a late equaliser to try to avoid a third straight league defeat, but instead, Phil Parkinson's side held on for their first home win over the Sky Blues in eight attempts since 1965.
