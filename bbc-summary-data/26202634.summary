[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Hull took a big step towards Premier League safety by thrashing Cardiff to leave their hosts deep in trouble.

Tom Huddlestone's deflected shot and Nikica Jelavic's low finish inside the box gave the Tigers a 2-0 half-time lead, despite Cardiff enjoying the greater possession.
Jelavic headed his second from Liam Rosenior's cross, with Jake Livermore's powerful shot capping a fine win.
Steve Bruce's side move up to 11th, eight points clear of Cardiff in 19th.
A positive opening for the hosts had seen them looking to attack down the flanks at every opportunity and attempting to create space between Hull's three centre-backs.
On-loan Manchester United winger Wilfried Zaha nearly gave Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's side the lead, dribbling past three players before testing Tigers goalkeeper Allan McGregor.

Moments later Kenwyne Jones' strong run and shot forced the Scotland international to parry the ball behind for a corner.
But as Cardiff pressed, Hull looked to counter - and the Tigers took the lead with their first real chance of the game.
Jelavic's close-range shot was saved brilliantly at point-blank range by Cardiff keeper David Marshall, but the ball rebounded to Huddlestone whose low, deflected drive found the net.
Cardiff continued to attack, Jones and Fraizer Campbell both sending close-range headers off target, but the Tigers' new strike partnership of Shane Long and Jelavic proved more clinical.
As half-time approached, Long broke clear of the Cardiff defence and his low cross was converted by Jelavic into the bottom corner of the net.
The home fans greeted the half-time whistle with boos, but after the break things only got worse for the Cardiff faithful.

Jelavic had wasted a great chance form six yards but made amends when he headed the ball into the corner of the net for his second and Hull's third, following a pin-point cross by Liam Rosenior.
The trickle of departing home fans were joined in greater numbers 10 minutes later when Ahmed Elmohamady intercepted Andrew Taylor's pass on halfway, ran to the edge of the area and squared the ball for Livermore to place the ball past Marshall.
The result - Hull's biggest away win in the top flight - also gave Bruce his 100th Premier League win as a manager. More importantly, it moves the Tigers six points clear of the relegation zone.
For Solskjaer, who had targeted this match as a potential win, it is now five defeats from his seven Premier League matches in charge - and the Bluebirds remain deep in relegation trouble.
