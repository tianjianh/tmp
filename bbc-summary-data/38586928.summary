Monty was shot in his intestines while in a wooded area in Cheddleton, Staffordshire, on Christmas Eve.
The first shooting in the area, on 8 December, resulted in a cat being shot in the leg.
RSPCA inspector Charlotte Melvin said Monty's shooting, which has only just been revealed, is very concerning.
Monty's owner Diane Lockett said the family "miss him so much".

"We were supposed to have all of the family over at ours for a big Christmas dinner, but I couldn't face doing it because we were all so upset."
Ms Melvin said: "It is very concerning that someone deliberately targeted an innocent animal like this. Monty would have been in horrific pain as a result of this incredibly cruel act."
A person caught deliberately using an air gun to injure an animal can be up to six months in prison and a Â£20,000 fine, she added.
Anyone with information about the incident is asked to contact the RSPCA.
