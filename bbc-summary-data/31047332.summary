Sixteen people have been killed in knife attacks in Greater Manchester in the last three years.
The blades will be used to create an angel statue in memory of those who have lost their lives to knife crime.
The sculptor, Alfie Bradley, said surrendered knives from other areas will also be used in the statue, which would show "the emotion and pain of using knives".
A former gang member from Moss Side, who was caught carrying a machete at the age of 14, now goes into schools to talk to youngsters about the dangers of gang violence.
Daryl Laycock said: "We've lost too many young lives.
"A lot of people carry knives for protection, but they pull out that knife and get it taken off them and get stabbed to death with it.
"I know over 50 people who have been murdered by violent crime and it's time to end it."
He said the campaign "can make a massive difference. Even if only one knife is handed in, that's at least one life saved".
Det Ch Insp Debbie Dooley said: "In the wrong hands, a knife is a deadly weapon.
"The knife bank will enable members of the public to surrender knives safely and anonymously and in turn remove these weapons from our streets."
The drop bins will be located at:
