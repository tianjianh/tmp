[SN]TITLE[SN]
Barnet 3-2 Notts County

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Barnet beat Notts County to extend their League Two unbeaten run to seven games.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Luke Gambin scored twice in the second half as the Bees moved level on points with seventh-placed Blackpool.
Notts arrived without a goal in three league games but they took the lead after 15 minutes, Michael O'Connor's whipped cross nestling into the top corner of Jamie Stephens' net.
But Barnet struck back in the 30th minute when John Akinde was allowed to turn and shoot and Bira Dembele followed up to score after Adam Collin's fine save.
Vadaine Oliver hit the bar for County just minutes later but the scores remained level until half-time.
Barnet dominated the early exchanges of the second half and the pressure told in the 64th minute when Gambin's deflected shot wrong-footed Collin.
The Malta international doubled his tally 10 minutes later, connecting with Curtis Weston's cross to finish off a fine counter-attacking move.
County responded in the 77th minute when Jonathan Forte followed in on substitute Graham Burke's well-hit 20-yard shot but it was not enough.
