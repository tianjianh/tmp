Former New York Governor George Pataki launches campaign

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Former New York Governor George Pataki has entered the contest for the Republican presidential nomination.

Mr Pataki, who served as governor from 1995 to 2006, is positioning himself as a moderate in a heavily conservative field.
He joins seven other Republicans who have announced their campaigns, and several others who are expected to announce in the coming weeks.
After leaving the governor's office, he served as a UN delegate.
Mr Pataki launched a fundraising "super-Pac" earlier this year - a standard move for a politician considering running for America's highest office.
But his campaign was officially kicked off in a video posted to his website on Thursday morning.
In the video, titled George Pataki For President, he played up his role as a Republican governor in a state dominated by Democrats.
"Washington has grown too big, too powerful, too expensive and too intrusive," he said. "This is exactly what the founding fathers feared...It is time to stand up, protect our freedom and take back this government".
Amid thumping music, the campaign video pointed to his leadership during the attacks of 11 September 2001, and stressed that he would be a unifying candidate.
Since leaving elected office in the middle of the last decade, Mr Pataki has struck a moderate tone in the news media.
Could a former Republican governor from a large state who hasn't held public office in more than eight years have a shot at winning the Republican presidential nomination in 2016?
If the man's last name is Bush, the answer is yes. If it's Pataki, the odds are significantly longer.
So why does Jeb Bush of Florida consistently sit near the top of polls and dominate campaign fundraising, while George Pataki - the man who, along with Mayor Rudy Giuliani, became the face of New York's response to the September 11 attacks - barely move the needle?
There's the name, of course. But it's also likely the fact that Mr Pataki is part of a dying breed of Northeast Republican moderates who blend fiscal conservatism with social positions closer to those of the political left. He's in favour of same-sex marriage, supports legalised abortions and backs robust environmental regulation, for instance.
Once upon a time candidates with these kinds of views were a force in the Republican Party. Those days are long past, however.
In recent months, he has criticised so-called Religious Freedom bills that many conservative Republicans support.
He has also been critical of of Republican lawmakers who wrote to Iranian leaders while the Obama Administration was negotiating Iran's nuclear programme. He called their actions "inappropriate".
Mr Pataki made his first public appearance as a candidate later on Thursday when he spoke in Exeter, New Hampshire.
