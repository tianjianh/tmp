The 26-year-old was a free agent after spending the last three seasons with the Stags, making 124 appearances in all competitions and scoring 12 goals.
He is the seventh player to join the Bootham Crescent side this summer.
"I've played against York City a lot of times and I've always admired the way they play and the atmosphere the fans create," he told BBC Radio York.
"As soon as I got the call that they wanted me I was straight in my car to get up here and get it done.
"I've heard a lot about the manager and I'm hopeful he can develop my game a lot."
