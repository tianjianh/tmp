[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Environment Secretary Liz Truss has set up a group to work on new flood protection measures for Cumbria in the wake of Storm Desmond.

The Cumbrian Floods Partnership group will look at how defences can be improved in the communities worst-hit by record rainfall in recent weeks.
Continued heavy rainfall and high river levels have led to more flood warnings being issued in the north of England.
A severe flood warning was issued for St Michael's on Wyre, Lancashire.
Lancashire Police advised affected residents to gather at a local pub as a precaution, with overnight accommodation provided at Garstang Leisure Centre.
There are more than 50 flood warnings, requiring residents to take action, in place elsewhere and 77 flood alerts, advising householders to be prepared.
Most of the Environment Agency alerts and warnings are across northern England and north and mid Wales, with large parts of east Lancashire and West Yorkshire affected.
The Cumbrian Floods Partnership body will be made up of community groups, the Environment Agency and local authorities.
It will look at how to reduce the impact of extreme weather, including how to slow down some of the larger rivers in the county to reduce the intensity of the flow of water.
Ms Truss said: "After seeing first-hand the impact of the flooding in the north of England, it is clear that the growing threat from more extreme weather events means we must reassure ourselves, and those communities at risk, that our defences, our modelling and our future plans are robust."
Residents will also have a say in how flood defences are improved.
Ms Truss also announced a National Flood Resilience Review which will carry out assessments of infrastructure, including electricity substations.
Tens of thousands were left without power when one substation suffered flood damage. About 400 properties in Cumbria remain without power.
The environment department will also assess how it calculates flood risk and update the government's "worst-case scenario" planning.
Ms Truss said: "We are already spending Â£2.3 billion over the next six years to better protect 300,000 homes from flooding, but we need to be sure we have the very best possible plans in place for flood prevention and protection across the whole country."
More than 5,000 homes in the northwest of England were flooded after Storm Desmond hit.
Worst affected areas have included Carlisle, Keswick, Kendal, Cockermouth, Appleby, Glenridding and St Michael's.
