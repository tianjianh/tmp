County Championship: Wet outfield ruins first day of the new season at Worcester

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Worcestershire and Kent spent a frustrating first day of the new County Championship season before play was called off in mid-afternoon.

Umpires Ian Gould and Richard Illingworth, the former Worcestershire and England slow left-armer, made several inspections.
But the previous day's incessant rain had left an already wet outfield totally sodden at New Road.
Overnight frost on the covers also led to melting ice dripping onto the pitch.
The two sides still hope to get underway promptly on Monday morning (11:00 BST).
Worcestershire assistant coach Matt Mason:
"We can't do anything about it. It's one of those things that is out of our control.
"We have given the ground a good chance to dry out today and it has not quite done it. Player safety has got to come first."
Kent captain Sam Northeast:
"It's extremely frustrating. After four weeks of preparation in pre-season, we get to the first day and we are unable to play and the sun's out as well.
"The boys are raring to go, so it's pretty disappointing. We hoped for the best but looking at the ground this morning, we knew it was going to be tough to get on."
