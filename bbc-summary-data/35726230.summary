Partygoers left out of pocket after Chester venue closes

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A company which ran a council-owned venue in Chester is closing down amid claims it owes deposits paid by customers for party bookings.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Friendly Island Ltd has run the 150-year-old Guildhall as an events venue since early 2015 after the building's previous operator ceased trading.
Maria Parlane, from Chester, said she had paid the company £850 to host her partner's 60th birthday party next year but had heard "nothing" from them.
Friendly Island Ltd has not commented.
Chester and Cheshire West councillor David Armstrong said: "We have been contacted by members of the public in regards to bookings for future events at Chester Guildhall that were arranged with the former tenant.
"We have advised that any such bookings and associated payments are a contract between the tenant and the individual, and the matter should therefore be pursued with the former tenant."
Director of Friendly Island Ltd Tylon Mafi has applied to have the company dissolved.
Documents lodged with Companies House show the application has been suspended because of an objection.
Maria Parlane booked the Guildhall with Friendly Island Ltd in February 2015 for her partner's 60th birthday in December 2016.
She said: "A 60th birthday is very special, and we have saved very hard, and are still saving hard for it.
"We are very, very upset, we are hurt.
"Everything is in place, but we've got nowhere to go and have it.
"We are £850 short, we don't know whether we are going to get [it] back."
Previous operator Umbrellah Ltd ceased trading in 2015.
Director Tahera Khalid insisted she was not aware of any customers owed their deposit money, but apologised if there were any.
Ms Khalid, also known as Tara Jade, said "The overheads were just getting higher and higher and footfall declined.
"We put a great deal of investment in. We've lost everything we had."
The council is now attempting to re-let the Watergate Street venue to a new operator.
The local authority says it will look at ways of ensuring anyone affected by a similar situation in the future can be compensated.
