Fly-tippers dumped more than 40 tonnes of rubbish at a recycling site in Teesside over the Christmas break.

The Parkway Centre at Coulby Newham is intended for unwanted newspapers, glass and cardboard.
But people "continued to dump non-recyclable items long after the containers were full", Middlesbrough Council said.
Councillor Tracy Harvey, executive member for environment, hit out at the "the irresponsible dumping of waste".
She said: "We do everything we can to make recycling as easy and as accessible as possible.
"However, the irresponsible dumping of waste that we have seen in recent days is nothing more than fly-tipping and is a criminal offence.
"This has resulted in considerable extra cost to clean these sites, as well as the nuisance and inconvenience caused by the thoughtless attitude of a small minority."
The waste has been cleared by a team of staff "taken away from their normal duties" working alongside the contractor who services the bins.
