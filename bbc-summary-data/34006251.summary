[SN]TITLE[SN]
Peterborough 'penile swab' prison nurse cleared

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A prison nurse who let a colleague take penile swabs from him and used offensive language towards inmates has been cleared to return to work.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Toby Bunting was suspended from HMP Peterborough while the Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC) heard his case.
He greeted prisoners with "hello bitches" or "hello slags" and did not declare drugs offences, it heard.
The NMC said it was in the public interest that a "skilled" nurse could work again.
Mr Bunting, who no longer works at the prison, was originally suspended for six months by the nursing body following a hearing in February.
He admitted a number of offences, including letting a colleague take swabs from him for training purposes.
The hearing heard Mr Bunting used inappropriate language to describe his colleagues, and showed one diagrams of penises.
It was also told he was convicted of drugs offences in the US in 1998 and 2000, but failed to declare them on his application form. The offences took place between January 2009 and November 2010.
Considering his case again following the suspension, the nursing body said Mr Bunting intended to do a return to practice course in January and would like to work again as a registered sexual health nurse.
It said the panel had also received medical evidence that showed he was managing his current health conditions.
The panel said: "You apologised for your failings and demonstrated clear remorse and understanding of the impact those failings had on colleagues, patients and the reputation of the nursing profession."
