Bedfordshire Police said the car did not stop when officers signalled for it to pull over, and then hit a property in High Town Road, Luton.
The teenager died at the scene, and a man was airlifted to hospital with serious injuries.
Officers are "particularly keen" to speak to a third person believed to have been in the car at the time of the crash.
Witnesses reported seeing a man fleeing from the vehicle with a police helicopter involved in the search for him.
People affected by the damage to the shop were evacuated from the building and a structural engineer was called to make the scene safe.
The force has referred itself to the Independent Police Complaints Commission "in line with standard protocol", a spokesman said.
"Anyone who witnessed the incident, or saw the Volkswagen Golf - which has a black bonnet and black roof - prior to the collision, is asked to contact police," the force said.
