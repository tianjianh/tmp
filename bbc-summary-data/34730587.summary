The Premier League champions are 15th in the table after six defeats in 11 matches and out of the League Cup.
"He doesn't need to prove anything to anybody," the Portuguese's adviser Jorge Mendes told BBC Sport's Dan Roan.
"He knows what to do. Many people are saying these things but there is no chance [he will leave]. He will solve the problem. He is the best."
Chelsea eased the pressure on Mourinho on Wednesday by beating Dynamo Kiev 2-1 in a Champions League group match at Stamford Bridge.
Blues fans sang their manager's name throughout the game and he thanked the supporters for their "amazing" reception.
Mourinho's side are at Stoke - who knocked them out of the League Cup on penalties - in the Premier League on Saturday.
The 52-year-old faces a one-match stadium ban for the match unless he appeals against the Football Association's punishment for his behaviour during the defeat by West Ham last month.

Mendes, who is reported to have brokered more than £1bn worth of transfers, has been described as one of the most powerful figures in the game.
A former DJ and nightclub owner, he also represents Cristiano Ronaldo, Angel di Maria, James Rodriguez, David de Gea, Radamel Falcao, Victor Valdes and Diego Costa.
"At FC Porto he won the Europa League, the league, the Champions League. He (Mourinho) won everything," added Mendes.
"After that, in Chelsea he was amazing. After 50 years he won the league and everyone was very happy with him.
"At Inter Milan, nobody expected Inter could win the Champions League - no way. Even the quarter-finals seemed quite impossible.
"At Real Madrid against the best team in the world he still won the league. He is special.
"The reaction from the supporters tells you everything. They like him.
"Everyone, players, coaches, you have good moments and bad moments. It is impossible to find someone like him to solve the problem."
Mourinho was also given a suspended stadium ban and £50,000 fine by the FA for comments made after the loss to Southampton on 3 October.
The Portuguese described that fine as a "disgrace" and appealed.
In addition to his disciplinary problems and team's poor form, the Portuguese has been criticised for his treatment of former Chelsea doctor Eva Carneiro.
Carneiro was dropped from first-team duties after Mourinho said she was "naive" for treating Eden Hazard during the opening-day draw against Swansea.
She has since left Chelsea and Mourinho is the subject of individual legal action from Carneiro, who is also suing the Stamford Bridge club for constructive dismissal.
