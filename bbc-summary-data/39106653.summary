Nathan Sawaya gave up his day job as a New York lawyer to become a Lego artist a few years ago.
Since then he has made a name for himself exhibiting his creations using children's building bricks.
His latest display in London features the characters of DC Comics.
The Art of the Brick: DC Super Heroes opens on Wednesday in a purpose-built tent on Upper Ground, South Bank.
