Harry Panayiotou was denied a stunning opener when his 25-yard effort hit the crossbar in the 31st minute.
But, soon after, Darren Cole overhit his 37th-minute pass back to goalkeeper Marc McCallum and Stewart stroked into the empty net.
Rovers goalkeeper Keith Cuthbert saved from Jordan White's lob before Stewart set up Aiden Connolly to tap in.
It secured the Kirkcaldy side only their second win in 13 Championship outings.
