Six Nations: Wales and Scotland fans face tighter checks

Rugby fans heading to Cardiff have been told to expect longer queues due to enhanced security ahead of Saturday's Six Nations game.

The Wales v Scotland showdown is the first major match at the renamed Principality Stadium since the Paris attacks in November.
Police stress there is no specific threat, but say there will be extra checks - including bag searches.
Officials said those leaving it late may not make the 16:50 GMT kick-off.
"Cardiff will be busy on matchday and those coming to the stadium should plan to arrive early to allow extra time to get through the turnstiles," said Principality Stadium manager Mark Williams.
He also advised fans to "leave rucksacks and larger bags at home" to avoid further delays.
South Wales Police said a decision was taken to step up security in Cardiff at a meeting of the city's safety advisory group last month.
Insp Andy Smith said: "With immediate effect this will mean if spectators bring a bag it might be searched before they can enter the four main stadia - the Cardiff City Stadium, the BT Sport Cardiff Arms Park, the SSE SWALEC Stadium and Principality Stadium.
"While there is no specific threat to south Wales, it is important that we all remain vigilant."
As well as heightened security, the city faces the usual road closures and changes to rail services on matchday.
Arriva Trains Wales said it had put on extra capacity to cope with an estimated 40,000 people travelling by rail to the match.
The redevelopment work at Central Square also means changes to the post-match queuing system, with leaflets outlining the new arrangements being handed out.
Arriva Trains Wales director Lynne Milligan added: "As always for Six Nations matches we are expecting the post-match queues to be very busy and customers may have to queue for up to two hours to catch their last train home."
Cardiff council said supervised park and ride facilities will be open from 09:30 GMT at Pentwyn and Leckwith, but urged motorists to pre-book their space online for the Leckwith car park.
