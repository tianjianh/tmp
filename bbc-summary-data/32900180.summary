India court orders two Greenpeace India accounts unblocked

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Delhi high court has ordered the Indian government to unfreeze two Greenpeace bank accounts in what is being seen as a major boost for the environmental group.

India blocked the accounts last month, accusing the group of violating tax laws and working against its economic interests.
Greenpeace said the restrictions were an "attempt to silence criticism".
Earlier this month, the group said it may be forced to shut down.
It said it had only about 30 days' worth of funds with which to pay office costs and salaries.
The group called Wednesday's high court order a "lifeline" and said it would allow Greenpeace India "access to the vast majority of its existing funds".
The pressure group "vowed to restart its campaigns to reduce air pollution, protect forests and boost solar power immediately".
Greenpeace, which has been present in India for 14 years and employs 340 people, says it has been targeted because of its campaigns on issues such as pollution and harmful pesticides.
In April, while freezing its bank accounts for six months, the government accused Greenpeace of not fully declaring the amount of foreign funds it brings into the country.
In a long-running dispute India has accused the environmental group of "stalling development projects" by protesting against large infrastructure plans.
Since coming to power in May last year, Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government has cracked down on several non-governmental organisations, leading to critics accusing him of showing undemocratic tendencies.
A month ago, India cancelled the registration of nearly 9,000 foreign-funded groups, saying they did not comply with the country's tax codes.
