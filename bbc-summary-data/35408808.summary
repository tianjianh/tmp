[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Pratt family, from St Ola, had given up hope of ever seeing two-year-old tortoise Tux again.
Their pet was allowed out in the garden for some exercise at the end of July last year.
No sign of Tux was found despite extensive searches, however, the missing tortoise was found in a field and reunited with 10-year-old Eve.
Her mother Tracey said Tux would be confined to a vivarium from now on.
