[SN]TITLE[SN]
Athletic Bilbao 0-1 Barcelona

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Barcelona made it two wins from their opening two La Liga games as Ivan Rakitic's first-half header earned them victory at Athletic Bilbao.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Croatian scored in the 21st minute when he arrived at pace to power in Arda Turan's cross from the left.
Lionel Messi, Luis Suarez and Turan also went close for the champions.
Barca keeper Marc-Andre ter Stegen almost paid for a terrible pass, and Athletic's Raul Garcia and Inaki Williams went close for Bilbao.
Sunday's win sees coach Luis Enrique's side join El Clasico rivals Real Madrid and early leaders Las Palmas on six points after two games of the new season.
Relive the action as it happened
The result should have been more emphatic for Barcelona, who wasted numerous chances.
Turan impressed in attack, but perhaps the abiding memory of the Turkey midfielder's display was his first-half miss from eight yards.
Messi shot inches wide after typically drifting past two defenders, and also fired over the bar. Suarez, his partner in attack, thundered a volley over from eight yards and also had an effort from two yards cleared off the line by Eneko Boveda in stoppage time.
Bilbao will rue missing the few good chances that came their way. Midfielder Raul Garcia saw his strike narrowly drift beyond Ter Stegen's post and Inaki Williams' poked effort was saved by the Barca keeper.
Ter Stegen was also fortunate not to be left red-faced in the first half when his pass out of defence was fired straight back at him by Spanish midfielder Benat.
Earlier on Sunday, the Gran Canaria club beat Granada 5-1 as they leapfrogged Real Madrid to go top of La Liga.
Summer signing Kevin-Prince Boateng scored for the second successive game, having netted on his debut in the 4-2 win over Valencia last week. Nabil El Zhar scored twice in the emphatic win.
In the other early match, Sporting Gijon drew 0-0 at Alaves and the late game between Villarreal and Sevilla also ended goalless.
Match ends, Athletic Club 0, Barcelona 1.
Second Half ends, Athletic Club 0, Barcelona 1.
