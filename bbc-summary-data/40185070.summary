The featherweight has not fought since his loss to Leo Santa Cruz in their WBA title fight in Las Vegas.
Frampton, 30, had promised his next bout would be in Belfast during the summer with Windsor Park or the SSE Arena the most likely venues.
The opponent has yet to be named but Frampton has already ruled out a fight against IBF champion Lee Selby.
Frampton has previously said that Windsor Park would be his preferred venue but the Irish FA has confirmed that it is still in negotiations with the boxer over the use of the stadium.
"Cyclone Promotions have held discussions with the IFA but nothing has been agreed," an IFA spokesperson told BBC Sport.
Confirmation of the venue is expected next week with the SSE Arena thought to be an alternative location.
Former two-weight world champion Frampton lost his WBA featherweight title to Santa Cruz in January. He was initially expected to fight the Mexican for a third time this summer but that bout failed to materialise.
A showdown against Selby had also been mooted but Frampton has confirmed that the Welsh fighter is unavailable as he is set to defend his IBF title against mandatory challenger Jonathan Victor Barros later this month.
