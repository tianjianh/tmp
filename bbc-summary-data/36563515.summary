Euro 2016: Lawro's predictions - final group games

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
BBC Sport football expert Mark Lawrenson is predicting the outcome of every game at the 2016 European Championship.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The final round of group games includes England v Slovakia, Wales v Russia and Northern Ireland v Germany
Before the group stage started, Lawro picked his two teams to go through automatically from each group into the knockout stage, and the six teams he thinks will finish bottom and definitely go home (four of the six third-placed teams also go through to the last 16).

Lawro was speaking to BBC Sport's Chris Bevan.

I have covered both Republic of Ireland games in Group E and they looked short of energy in Saturday's defeat by Belgium.
Republic manager Martin O'Neill cannot make many changes for this game, though, because he has not really got the personnel.
Italy are already guaranteed to top the group, and I expect them to rest a lot of players because they can afford to, but I still do not see the Republic winning.
O'Neill's side will not lack endeavour, and they can keep Italy out, but I cannot see where the goals are going to come from, even against an under-strength Italian side.
Belgium got a very good result against the Republic of Ireland on Saturday and scored some high-quality goals but they were very pedestrian at times.
Sweden are another side who need a win to have any chance of making the last 16 but for that to happen we need to see a lot more of Zlatan Ibrahimovic than we have done so far at this tournament.
