[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Joshua Aryeetey, 47, from Ghana, was on board the Banff-registered Beryl fishing boat when the incident happened off Shetland in February.
The Marine Accident Investigation Branch (MAIB) said he was conscious, wearing a lifejacket and was quickly brought alongside the vessel.
However he spent about 49 minutes in the water, and could not be saved.
He had been carried overboard by a net.
Safety recommendations about training drills have been made.
'Practical drill'
The MAIB report said: "The crew's attempts to recover the casualty on board were unsuccessful.
"The crewman was unresponsive when eventually recovered onto a rescue craft launched from a nearby offshore support vessel."
He was then transferred by coastguard helicopter to Gilbert Bain Hospital in Lerwick, but could not be saved.
The report continued: "The accident occurred because the crewman was standing in an unsafe position.
"It is one of a number of recent accidents in which fishermen have died after falling or being carried or swept overboard while trawling when the vessels' crews have been unable to recover them back on board.
"In this case, Beryl's crew had not completed a practical man overboard drill during their time on board and they were unfamiliar with the man overboard recovery system carried."
It concluded: "Recommendations have been made to the Maritime and Coastguard Agency, Scottish Fishermen's Federation, National Federation of Fishermen's Organisations and the Sea Fish Industry Authority.
"These are aimed at identifying initiatives to encourage fishermen to conduct practical emergency drills and to use risk assessments as a catalyst for behavioural change.
"The recommendations are also intended to improve the likelihood of recovering persons from the water by ensuring that the recovery systems carried by fishing vessels are suitable and that sufficient and realistic man overboard drills are carried out on board.
"A recommendation has also been made to Beryl's owner, which seeks to improve the overall safety of its crews, and their ability to respond to emergencies."
