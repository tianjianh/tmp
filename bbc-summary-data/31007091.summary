Dundee's V&A project has been awarded a further £4.5m of funding from the Heritage Lottery Fund.

The body had already contributed £9.4m, including £8m of capital funding, to the museum on the banks of the Tay.
It was revealed this month that the cost of the project has almost doubled to £80m, with Dundee City Council and the Scottish government also pledging extra money.
Project bosses said the new funding meant work could begin on site soon.
The funding was agreed following a meeting of the Heritage Lottery Fund's UK board.
Chief executive Carole Souter said: "V&A Dundee will provide Scotland with a world-class museum of design while making a transformational contribution to the cultural, social and economic regeneration of the city.
"We can now look forward to seeing this iconic building start to take shape and realising its full potential."
Dundee city councillors agreed on Monday to allocate £6.5m of the authority's capital budget to the project, and talks are ongoing with the Scottish government about developing a "growth acceleration model" proposal, which would provide additional funding for the museum and the wider £1bn city waterfront regeneration project.
V&A Dundee director Philip Long said the "generous support" from the Heritage Lottery Fund was a "significant boost" to the museum.
He said: "Together with important recent decisions by Scottish government and Dundee City Council it opens the door to an impending site start.
"We can now look forward to getting on and building this outstanding new museum, the first in the UK to be dedicated to design outside London.
"The renewed support of our funding and founding partners underlines the momentum and determination driving forward V&A Dundee, which will do so much to change the fortunes of this city."
Work on the museum is scheduled to begin by the end of March, which could lead to it opening by June 2018.
