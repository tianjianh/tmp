He and co-driver Daniel Barritt finished in sixth place overall.
Evans was more than six minutes behind team-mate Ogier.
Toyota's Jari-Matti Latvala finished in second place, with M-Sport's Ott Tanak in third.
Evans drove for M-Sport in the top class for two seasons in 2014 and 2015, but was demoted to the WRC2 class in 2016.
The second round of the WRC starts in Sweden on 9 February.
