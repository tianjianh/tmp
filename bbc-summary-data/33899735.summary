Thursday's yuan guidance rate was set 1% lower, a smaller margin than the shock cuts earlier in the week.
The midpoint is a guiding rate set by the government, from which trade can rise or fall 2% during the day.
The Shanghai Composite index closed up 1.8% at 3,954.56, with hopes that the lower yuan will help exports.
In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng ended up 0.4% at 24,018.80.
In Japan, the Nikkei 225 index, closed the day 1% higher at 20,595.55 rebounding from hefty losses the previous day.
That was despite the release of official figures showing Japan's core machinery orders fell 7.9% in June, the first decline for four months.
In South Korea, the Kospi index finished the day 0.4% higher at 1,983.46. The country's central bank kept interest rates unchanged at 1.5%, as expected.
In Australia, the benchmark S&P/ASX 200 closed almost flat at 5,387.90.
Shares in mining giant BHP Billiton rebounded slightly, rising 1.2%, while a rise in gold prices sent other mining companies higher.
