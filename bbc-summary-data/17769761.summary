[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The HomeServe insurance and home repair company has been fined £750,000 for making too many silent or abandoned calls to potential customers.

The telecoms regulator Ofcom said Homeserve had been guilty of a serious breach of its rules on such calls.
Ofcom said it hoped the fine would send a "strong message" to all companies.
The Walsall based firm has offered to pay compensation of £10 each to the estimated 51,000 householders who were called in February and March last year.
The company blamed faulty equipment at a call centre firm which had been contracted to make the calls on its behalf.
"HomeServe identified the issue and promptly reported it to Ofcom, following an internal audit of all of HomeServe's telemarketing operations," the insurer said.
"The problem was identified as having resulted from the incorrect use of Answering Machine Detection technology via an outsourcer.
"HomeServe can also confirm that all of its dialler systems have been fully compliant with Ofcom regulations since 22 March 2011, following the rectification of the errors identified during HomeServe's audit," it added.
Ofcom's Consumer Group Director, Claudio Pollack, said: "Our rules are there to prevent consumers suffering annoyance, inconvenience or anxiety from silent or abandoned calls."
"We hope today's fine will send a strong message to all companies that use call centres that they need to ensure they are fully compliant with the rules or face the consequences."
Barclaycard was fined the then maximum fine of £50,000 for a similar offence in 2008.
The maximum potential fine was raised to £2m in September 2010.
Adam Scorer at Consumer Focus said he was pleased with the regulator's action.
"While silent and abandoned calls are usually caused by glitches in the technology rather than a deliberate act by sales staff, they are a nuisance and firms that do not control the technology show a lack of respect to consumers," he said.
