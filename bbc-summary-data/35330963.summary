Inverness CT 0-0 Partick Thistle

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An uninspiring encounter saw Inverness edge into the Premiership top six and Partick move a point clear of the relegation play-off place.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The hosts started strongly with Miles Storey going through on goal, but Tomas Cerny raced forward and blocked well.
Chances became infrequent, Ross Draper unsuccessfully claiming a penalty when he went down at the back post.
Liam Polworth had a great opportunity to win it late on but somehow steered the ball wide of the post.
A win for either side would have been a significant step and Inverness seemed intent on earning that early on.
Andrea Mbuy-Mutombo tried exactly the same effort that opened the scoring against Stirling Albion in the Scottish Cup midweek win but dragged his strike wide.
Another chance arrived moments later when Storey found space in the box, tried to slot the ball under Cerny, but the goalkeeper came out swiftly to deny him.
Inverness looked on-form and a period of pressure allowed Iain Vigurs an opportunity from outside the box which crept narrowly over the bar.
Slack play from a throw in gave Vigurs the chance to square with Frederic Frans just clearing his own bar with an attempted clearance.
The quality on offer took a fairly dramatic downturn with neither side particularly threatening. though a challenging wind may have played a part.
Draper claimed for a penalty when Mutombo nodded to the back post, and then just before half-time saw a header creep narrowly over from close-range.
For all of Thistle's lack of threat, they did defend stoutly after the opening period.
Kris Doolan had a scooped effort on the stretch from the edge of the box which was saved comfortably.
The second half lacked action for long periods but Storey almost netted a sensational opener with a fierce long-range drive which Cerny had to tip over.
Storey created the next chance when he got to the bye-line and cut back for Polworth, who couldn't hit the target when a goal seemed inevitable.
Perhaps a better point for the visitors who defended well and ease themselves away from the bottom with games in hand.
