Bristol's St Pauls Carnival has been postponed until September due to "ongoing challenges", organisers say.

The event, which normally takes place in July, is being run by a new management team which said circumstances were "beyond their control".
The carnival began in 1967 and is a celebration of the city's Afro-Caribbean culture.
Tens of thousands of people attended the event in 2014.
A spokesperson said: "Whilst we understand the disappointment, we are confident the community will be behind our efforts and we look forward to working with the community and partners over the coming months."
St Pauls Carnival is funded by Arts Council England and Bristol City Council.
