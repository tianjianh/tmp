The 26-year-old winger ran from her own half to cap a 27-3 Irish victory and put them one point ahead of England who are the only other unbeaten team.
A five-point haul did not look likely when the first half ended 3-3.
But Leah Lyons, Sophie Spence and Paula Fitzpatrick got tries before Tyrrell got the fourth with the final play.
Last week, Ireland started their campaign with a late 22-15 bonus-point win away to Scotland.
Their next match is on Sunday, 26 February when they host France at Donnybrook.
"That is the second week in a row we have played beyond the 80 minutes to get the win," said Irish coach Tom Tierney.
"It is great credit to the girls - thankfully we got out on the right side again."
Italy, who last beat Ireland in 1997, started brightly and the visitors struggled to get into the game.
But the Irish threatened to get the opening try when Alison Miller broke down the left, only to be halted short of the line by a fine tackle by Italian scrum-half Sara Baratine.
An offside offence led by Nora Stapleton kicking Ireland into the lead but Michela Sillari replied for hosts just before the interval.
Ireland scored their first try in the 51st minute when Lyons cleverly pushed the ball against the base of an upright after they had been held up just short.
Just three minutes later, Spence crashed over for the second try and Stapleton again converted.
Skipper Paula Fitzpatrick touched down on 61 minutes from recycled ball after a great break by centre Jenny Murphy to make it 22-3.
However, it looked like the bonus point was going to slip from Ireland's grasp with Italy attacking as the clock went red.
But then the ball broke for Tyrrell whose long run for the line brought that important fourth try.
