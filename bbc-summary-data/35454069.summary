Another boy, 12, was attacked by two youths shortly after getting off a bus near Angerstein Road in North End on Tuesday.
One boy punched him in the stomach while the other pulled him to the ground in a headlock. They then stole his iPhone 4.
Hampshire Constabulary said a boy was arrested on Saturday on suspicion of robbery and released on bail.
"The investigation is ongoing and we are continuing to appeal to identify the other boy," a spokesman said.
The victim was "understandably" left "very shaken" by the attack, he added.
