Man in prosthetic arm battle with NHS England

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man who lost his arm in a car crash 13 years ago has said he risks losing his independence if he is denied a new prosthetic by the NHS.

Adrian Barrass, 51, from Mexborough in South Yorkshire had his right arm amputated after a car accident in 2004.
He has applied for a new type of prosthetic after other types he was given did not work for him.
NHS England said patients can receive further treatment if the usual NHS care is not appropriate for them.

Mr Barrass said a new arm would make a "massive difference" to his life.
"Tying your shoelaces, spreading butter, it sounds so simple but you try doing it with one hand. It's horrible," he said.
"The little things would mean the most, like being able to put both my arms around my children."
He has applied several times to NHS England's Individual Funding Request (IFR) panel for a new type of prosthetic without success.
He is being supported by the Wentworth and Dearne Labour MP John Healey, who said specialists at Leeds Hospital believe Mr Barrass would benefit from the digital elbow prosthesis.
The MP said the NHS appeared to be "stonewalling".
In a statement NHS England said: "Following an IFR, patients are assessed to determine whether their particular condition means the treatment already available is unsuitable.
"Patients can receive treatments if it is determined their particular clinical situation means they are so different from others who have the same clinical condition that the usual NHS care is not appropriate for them."
