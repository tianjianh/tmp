Major High Street banks are among the biggest losers of customers switching current accounts, figures have confirmed.

As reported earlier this week on the BBC, the UK's biggest banks have lost some customers following a change to the switching system.
It now takes seven working days to change accounts, rather than up to 30 as was the case previously.
All regular payments are automatically moved over to the new account.
For 36 months after the switch, payments accidentally made to or requested from the old account are automatically redirected to the new one.
Banks including Barclays, NatWest, HSBC, Lloyds Bank and RBS were among those recording the biggest losers of customers using the switching service between July and September last year, figures show.
Meanwhile, Halifax, Santander, Nationwide Building Society and Tesco Bank made net gains in current account customers using the switching service.
The Payments Council, which oversees the switching system, said 1.14 million current account customers switched to another deal in the past 12 months, a 7% year-on-year increase.
Andrew Hagger, of MoneyComms, said: "The figures show that although more people are voting with their feet and looking for a more suitable banking relationship, the vast majority are refusing to budge from their existing provider despite the array of enticing upfront cash incentives on offer.
"The confusing array of different tariffs on offer for credit interest, cashback, rewards and overdraft charges means the current account market remains a minefield for customers looking to find the most appropriate deal."
