[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Championship side Sheffield Wednesday have signed goalkeeper Jake Kean after his contract with Norwich City was terminated by mutual consent.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Kean joined the Canaries in July 2015 following his departure from Blackburn, but never played for the club.
The 25-year-old made a total of eight appearances in loan spells with Colchester and Swindon last season.
"There is a lot of competition but any competition is good competition," Kean told the club website.
"It's up to me to come here and have a go and try to get that number one shirt, but it's Keiren Westwood's at the minute and if I can provide more competition for him and make him play better, then great."
The length of Kean's deal at Hillsborough has not been disclosed.
