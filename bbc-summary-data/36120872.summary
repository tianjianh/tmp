Football League: Five things you may have missed

It was a day of more downs than ups in the Football League with the end of the season now in touching distance.

BBC Sport looks at five things you may have missed on an afternoon that saw MK Dons, Colchester and York City all suffer relegation.
Coventry City extended perhaps the most unwanted record in the Football League on Saturday.
The Sky Blues fell to a 2-0 defeat by struggling Doncaster to ensure that their wait to finish in the top six of any division will now stretch to 47 years.
That's right, Coventry have not finished sixth or higher since registering a sixth-placed finish in the then first division in 1970.
It had all looked so different earlier in the season when Tony Mowbray's side led the way in the third tier in late November.
However, four successive defeats in late February and early March saw them drop out of the promotion places and they have not returned since, meaning a fourth season in League One beckons.
The team's slump has left Mowbray baffled. He told BBC Coventry and Warwickshire: "I feel as disappointed as I've been in the team all year. Where is the team that we saw beat Gillingham 4-0, Millwall 4-0 and Wigan 2-0? Where has that team gone?
"Maybe it's a bit too much for a few young players. I'm really disappointed for the supporters who've come out for them.
"In my mind the promotion push was over quite a while ago, while mathematically you could still do it and you keep going but I don't think it was realistic to think that we were going to do that."
On 28 April, 2015 Wigan were relegated from the Championship without playing, as Rotherham's win over Reading consigned them to a second relegation in three years.
On Tuesday, a little less than a year later, the Latics could be promoted back to the Championship also without playing if Walsall fail to beat Shrewsbury.
In reality, the League One leaders are as good as promoted already as their goal difference is vastly superior to the Saddlers.
Chairman David Sharpe promised that the 2013 FA Cup winners would "bounce back" and that nothing other than promotion will suffice. Fortunately his charges have come good on his words.
Boss Gary Caldwell was delighted with his side's performance in their 4-1 win over Southend on Saturday. He told BBC Radio Manchester: "We've focused on improving over the last few weeks and I thought today the performance was sensational.
"We deserved to win more comfortably than we did in the end."
He added: "Whether we win the league or not it is about improving as a club and moving forward. My focus is on preparing the team for Blackpool."
They all needed a miracle to survive before kick-off today, but there was to be no divine intervention as three teams had their relegations confirmed.
MK Dons went down from the Championship, Colchester were relegated from League One and York City dropped out of the Football League.
Brentford beat Karl Robinson's Dons 4-1 while Colchester and York lost 3-0 to Burton and Accrington respectively.
Robinson, who led the club to the Championship for the first time last year, told BBC Three Counties Radio he "felt sick" by their drop back into League One.
"Everyone knows my dedication to this football club and right now it is as difficult as it can be for me. I've not known the feeling of being relegated before," he said.
"It's not a case of me pointing my finger at anybody or anything. First and foremost I need to be honest with myself."
U's boss Kevin Keen, who saw his team drop to the fourth tier for the first time in 18 years, told BBC Essex: "It's an extremely painful afternoon on the side of the pitch. But the chairman has been so supportive and loves this club.
"There are so many good things about this club and it's got a really bright future. I want the supporters to stick with it."
Minstermen manager Jackie McNamara told BBC Radio York: "You can see why they are up at the top of the league. I don't think we had enough players on their game today. We got what we deserved.
"We're not relegated because of today but because of the season. There's been too many bad performances."
Notts County might have avoided relegation from League Two this season but it has been a pretty disastrous campaign for the Meadow Lane side.
The Magpies have sacked two managers - including Jamie Fullarton after just 70 days - been dumped out of the FA Cup by non-league Salford City and current boss Mark Cooper said the team runs the risk of alienating themselves from the fans.
Saturday's 2-1 home defeat by Cambridge, managed by ex-Magpies boss Shaun Derry, means they have now lost six of their last 10 matches to sit 17th in League Two.
Cooper, who said he would not allow the players to cost him his job after Tuesday's 3-1 defeat by Barnet, is only contracted to the club until the end of the season.
Assistant boss Richard Dryden told BBC Radio Nottingham: "We started horrifically. It was ridiculous. You can't work out how we are conceding so many soft goals.
"It's difficult to find a silver lining."
