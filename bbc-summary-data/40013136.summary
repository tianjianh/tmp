James Reilly is alleged to have defrauded the Tayforth Veterans Project in Dundee's City Quay.
Prosecutors say Mr Reilly was a project manager and trustee and entrusted with the safekeeping of money.
Mr Reilly denied a single charge of embezzlement during a pre-trial hearing at Dundee Sheriff Court.
It is alleged the 66-year-old of Balmullo, Fife, embezzled £80,050 from the charity's funds between 16 August 2011 and 29 October 2013.
Sheriff Alastair Carmichael continued the case to a trial date in June.
