Poppyscotland has released 46,000 poppy petals from the top of the National Wallace Monument to commemorate the end of the Battle of Arras.

Each petal represents a Scottish soldier who lost their life or was wounded during the 1917 conflict.
The battle saw the greatest concentration of Scottish battalions of any during the World War One.
The event included a commemorative service led by the Royal British Legion Scotland (Legion Scotland).
Poppyscotland's head of fundraising, Gordon Michie, said: "The sight of thousands of poppy petals gently fluttering to earth was a dramatic and fitting way to mark the centenary of the Battle of Arras.
"It was also a moment to remember those for whom the poppy is a symbol of hope today and to show our support for the Armed Forces community living in Scotland.
"We were delighted so many were able to come along and witness the poignant spectacle of the Arras Petal Cascade."
The Battle of Arras was fought in April and May 1917 to support a French offensive on the Aisne by diverting large numbers of German reserves to the north.
Three Scottish infantry divisions took part in the assault and 44 of the 120 participating British infantry battalions were from Scottish regiments.
