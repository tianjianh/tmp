Freddie Sears came close to giving the visitors an early lead when he forced Keiren Westwood into a fine save.
Fernando Forestieri then scored a third goal in five games, latching on to Ross Wallace's ball to put the Owls ahead.
Ipswich levelled against the run of play when England U17 midfielder Dozzell headed Liam Feeney's cross home from close range.
It is 32 years since Dozzell's father Jason became the youngest goalscorer in the top flight when he also scored on his debut, for the same club, at the age of 16.
The result leaves Wednesday five points above seventh-placed Cardiff City in the last of the play-off places with four games to play.
The Tractor Boys lie eight points and two places worse off with the chances of a top-six finish looking slim.
Wednesday dominated much of the match and could have doubled their advantage when Lucas Joao set up Barry Bannan, but he shot straight at keeper Bartosz Bialkowski.
Sheffield Wednesday head coach Carlos Carvalhal:
"We played against a strong opponent, one which had ambitions of promotion at the start of the season. We are in a better position than we were before the game. We have a five-point gap over Cardiff.
"We'd prefer the win but, for me, it's the way you win, draw or lose. The way we drew today is a positive. We drew because we missed a lot of chances, not because we didn't create any.
"We showed we were a consistent team today and played our football. The first 20 minutes weren't great but after that we played good football. We are in a good position now. I talk about reality and the reality is that we must win games. This is a crucial week and we must concentrate on the next game."
Ipswich Town manager Mick McCarthy:
"It's a good point but it doesn't do us much good apart from that it gives us a bit of comfort that we've got a squad of lads who want to scrap, to play, to fight in a game which could have easily got away from us.
"Good genes produce good players and Andre (Dozzell) is a good player. I thought he deserved his opportunity. I always said that if we got to the end of the season and it looked like it had drifted away from us, I'd give him a chance.
"I'm always disappointed when we don't meet our expectations, my personal expectations. I thought we could have been a top-six side this season. We've suffered a lot of injuries and it's affected us. We've had a bad four or five weeks. We've had a tough time, and it's finished off our season."
