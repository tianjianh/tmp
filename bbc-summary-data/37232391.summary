The 25-year-old, who was a free agent after leaving Burton Albion, has agreed a one-year deal at Bloomfield Road with an option for a second year.
Lyness, who spent last season on loan at Blackpool, will compete with Sam Slocombe for the number one shirt.
"I want competition for places throughout the squad, and I'm sure the goalkeepers will bring out the best in each other," manager Gary Bowyer said.
