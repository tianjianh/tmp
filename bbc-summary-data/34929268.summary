Rory Miskelly: DCAL man to head GAA Casement project

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A senior civil servant is to move to a new role as head of the GAA's Casement Park redevelopment project in west Belfast.

Rory Miskelly has already been involved in the project through his job at the Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure.
He will now be working as a full-time employee of the GAA.
Mr Miskelly has vast experience when it comes to multi-million pound building projects in Belfast.
He helped deliver the Titanic Visitor Centre and the revamped Ravenhill rugby stadium.
Now comes, arguably, his greatest challenge - ensuring a new stadium at Casement Park is built.
Work was due to begin in early 2015.
However, planning permission for the stadium was overturned in December 2014, and since then it has been embroiled in controversy over emergency exit plans.
The GAA also faced opposition from local residents over its plans to build the state-of-the-art, 38,000-capacity stadium.
It will not be built this year, or next. But a new planning application is expected within the next six months.
Before that, another community consultation will take place.
It is understood the GAA may be willing to reduce the planned 38,000 capacity.
However, they still want the ground to hold at least 32,500 spectators, and would prefer more.
