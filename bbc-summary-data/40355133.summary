The Visit Dallas DNA Pro Cycling rider finished the 22km course in 32 minutes 11.32 seconds, 19.62 seconds ahead of Hannah Barnes (Canyon-SRAM).
Rose, who won silver in 2016, said she was "over the moon" to be able to wear the national champion's jersey.
Katie Archibald finished third and 2016 champion Hayley Simmonds fourth.
Rose, from Gloucestershire, added: "It's not quite sunk in yet, but I'm really, really happy.
"I knew at about the halfway point that I was just up, so I was really gunning it on the second half of the course."
The Isle of Man's Anna Christian (Drops' Cycling) crossed the line in 34:13.77 to win the under-23 title and finish seventh overall.
Melissa Lowther (Team Breeze) finished second and Christian's team-mate Alice Barnes third.
Meanwhile, Scott Davies continued his dominance of the men's under-23 category by claiming his fourth straight victory.
Team Wiggins rider Davies finished nearly 50 seconds clear of nearest challenger Tom Bayliss (One Pro Cycling), with Charlie Tanfield (Brother NRG) third.
Davies said: "It's brilliant. I gave it my all and it's brilliant to do it for a fourth time."
It is the final time he can compete in the age group before stepping up to senior level.
