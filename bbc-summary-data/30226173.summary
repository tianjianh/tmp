Hughes, 25, died on Thursday two days after being struck by a ball during a domestic match in Sydney.
The match - a warm-up for India's Test tour - was scheduled for Friday and Saturday at Adelaide Oval.
Cricket Australia's general manager Pat Howard said: "Today we were reminded that cricket is just a game."
"It is the characters that play the game that make it so special," added Howard.
The decision to cancel the fixture was made by the Australia Cricket Association and players, many of whom had returned home to "seek support and solace from their family, friends and teammates," according to Howard.
India are set to play four Tests on their tour, beginning in Brisbane on 4 December.
Elsewhere, the second day's play in the third Test between Pakistan and New Zealand in Sharjah was abandoned as a mark of respect for Hughes's death.
