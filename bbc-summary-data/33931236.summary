The former IRA man shot dead outside his home in Belfast's Short Strand area earlier this week had been told by police he was under threat from republicans.

Kevin McGuigan Sr was given the warning shortly after the killing of former IRA commander Gerard 'Jock' Davison in May.
The two men were once close friends.
But they fell out and Mr McGuigan was later shot several times in a so-called punishment attack.
The attack was said to have been ordered by Jock Davison.
BBC News NI's home affairs correspondent Vincent Kearney said: "When Mr Davison was shot dead in May, republicans suspected Mr McGuigan may have been involved.
"It has emerged that shortly after the killing, the father of nine was warned by the police that he was under threat from republicans.
"That will further fuel speculation that he was killed in a revenge attack by members of the Provisional IRA.
"The police have warned against such speculation and say they have an open mind about who might have been responsible."
A man and a woman arrested as part of the murder investigation have been released unconditionally.
First Minister Peter Robinson has warned of serious political repercussions if it is established that the Provisional IRA was involved.
Sinn Féin has said the organisation was not involved.
Earlier, the sister of Belfast murder victim Robert McCartney called for an external police force to investigate the killing of Mr McGuigan.
Catherine McCartney, whose brother was stabbed to death more than a decade ago, said she had "zilch confidence" in the PSNI to investigate.
"People in this place need justice, they need a police service that works, they need a police service that is impartial," she said.
"It shouldn't matter what your involvement is in the peace process or who you are, if you are murdered in the street you deserve protection from the state and you deserve a proper investigation.
"It doesn't happen here, because everything is politically sieved."
Ms McCartney said she believed the PSNI was incapable of dealing with paramilitary murders that could have an impact on the "peace process".
"I would be asking people from outside to come in and investigate these murders. I have zilch confidence in the police when it comes to murders like this," she added.
In response, the police said: "The particular arrangements in place in Northern Ireland guarantee unprecedented levels of scrutiny and accountability.
"These ensure that everyone in our community can have confidence that police are answerable for their actions and decisions in conducting major investigations."
No-one has ever been convicted of killing Mr McCartney, whose case came to international attention because of a campaign by his sisters.
They blamed the IRA for murdering him and interfering with evidence and witnesses.
Ms McCartney said she believed the IRA was the only group that could carry out the murder of Mr McGuigan.
Commenting on Sinn Féin's denial of that, she said: "Sinn Féin's default position is always it wasn't the IRA, and I would like to ask Sinn Féin how they know that?
"I would be interested to know how they can establish that so quickly?"
