Mohamed Diame has retired from international football, saying he believes he is no longer among the best Senegalese players.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 29-year-old, who plays his club football in England for Newcastle, appeared 36 times for the Teranga Lions and played at the 2012 Olympics.
He said: "I believe that there are now 23 Senegalese players in better shape.
"After much thought and consideration I feel that now is the appropriate time to focus fully on my club career."
Diame has been mainly used as a substitute by Senegal since Aliou Cisse took charge of the team in March 2015.
