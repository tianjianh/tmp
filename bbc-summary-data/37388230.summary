[SN]TITLE[SN]

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Edinson Cavani scored four first-half goals as champions Paris St-Germain ended a three-game winless run in all competitions to beat Caen in Ligue 1.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Uruguayan striker, who was replaced by Jese at half-time, opened the scoring from Maxwell's cross before converting a penalty.
He then turned home another Maxwell cross and guided a fourth goal past Remy Vercoutre before being withdrawn.
Lucas Moura and Jean-Kevin Augustin smashed home second-half efforts.
Cavani had been criticised for missing a host of chances in Tuesday's 1-1 Champions League draw with Arsenal.
PSG, chasing their fifth consecutive French title, won the league by 31 points last season, but have already lost a game this season under Unai Emery, who replaced Laurent Blanc in the summer.
It is PSG's second 6-0 win over Caen in five months, having also thrashed them in the closing weeks of last season.
