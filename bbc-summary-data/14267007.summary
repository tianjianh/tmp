'Breivik manifesto' details chilling attack preparation

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A 1,500-page "manifesto"  recently published online, entitled 2083: A European Declaration of Independence, has been attributed to Anders Behring Breivik, who has admitted being behind Friday's bloody twin attacks in Norway.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Part of the tract details the author's "personal reflections and experiences during several preparation phases", apparently in the run-up to the 22 July attacks.
Over dozens of pages, the author chillingly and meticulously details his efforts to create cover stories for his plot, to build up his personal fitness levels, and to acquire the weaponry and explosives materials needed.
It also sketches out aspects of his mental preparation for the act he intends to commit.
But according to the Norwegian anti-Islamic citizen journalist website Document.no, to which Mr Breivik himself was a frequent contributor, large parts of the manifesto are copied directly from "Unabomber" Ted Kaczynski's own manifesto, with minor changes such as replacement of the word "leftist" by the phrase "cultural Marxist". Kaczynski is serving a life sentence for carrying out a bombing campaign in the US from 1978 to 1995, sending 16 bombs which killed three people and injured another 23, organised from a remote cabin in the state of Montana.
The manifesto begins with an entry for April/May 2002, in which the author claims to have been "ordinated as the 8th Justiciar Knight for the PCCTS, Knights Templar Europe" - the "resistance movement" that elsewhere he claims has been established to combat the "Islamisation" of Europe.
"I joined the session after visiting one of the initial facilitators, a Serbian Crusader Commander and war hero, in Monrovia, Liberia... Our primary objective is to develop PCCTS, Knights Templar into becoming the foremost conservative revolutionary movement in Western Europe [in] the next few decades."
From 2002-2006, the log claims, the author raised funds for his venture - with 2006-2008 spent researching and writing his manifesto.
By the autumn of 2009, the author claimed to be preparing for the next phase.
"I'm creating two different and 'professional looking' prospectuses for 'business ventures'. A mining company and a small farm operation.
"The reasoning for this decision is to create a credible cover in case I am arrested in regards to the purchase and smuggling of explosives or components to explosives - fertiliser. In this regard I created a new company called Geofarm, which might act as a credible cover for such activities."
Geofarm is a farm which has been linked to Anders Behring Breivik.
In July 2010, the author wrote he had "successfully finished the 'armour acquisition phase'" - including buying a protective case to store the weapons underground in a forest.
But it was not an easy operation - the author was plagued by mosquitoes, spiders (with which he says he has "serious issues") and underground rocks while he dug the hole, which took him five hours.
In September 2010, the author says: "I now have to acquire a semi-automatic rifle and Glock [pistol] legally...
"I don't have a criminal record so there is no reason why the police should reject my application."
The author goes on: "I have now sent an application for a Ruger Mini 14 semi-automatic rifle (5.56)... On the application form I stated: 'hunting deer'. It would have been tempting to just write the truth; 'executing category A and B cultural Marxists/multiculturalist traitors' just to see their reaction :P."
In October-November 2010, he writes: "I have now made my first order for one of the chemicals required for my initiator from an online-based Polish supplier. I will have to order another 4-5 different ingredients online before I am done.
"Needless to say; this is an extremely vulnerable phase. In fact, it is the most vulnerable phase of them all. If I get through this phase without trouble I will be very close to finalizing my operation.
"I am somewhat concerned but I have credible cover stories for each individual chemical (with the exception of one) should there be any complication."
Fears of detection are repeatedly described in the log.
He goes on to say: "So what do I do when I'm not working? I'm in the middle of another steroid cycle at the moment, training hard to exceed my 92 kg record from July... I have a more or less perfect body at the moment and I'm as happy as I have ever been.
"My morale is at an all time high and I'm generally happy with how things are progressing. I may create an ideological Knights Templar Youtube movie this winter."
A video titled Knights Templar 2083 and posted on YouTube has indeed been attributed to Mr Breivik.
Later in the same entry: "As for girlfriends; I do get the occasional lead, or the occasional girl making a move, especially now a day as I'm fit like hell and feel great. But I'm trying to avoid relationships as it would only complicate my plans and it may jeopardize my operation."
In November, December and January, the author claims he is undergoing pistol training "to fulfill the government requirement for purchase".
"Documentation and activity requirement was met. I joined my local pistol club back in 2005 for the first time but have only sporadically attended training until November 2010.
"The fact that I joined the club as early as 2005 was a planned move to increase my chances for obtaining a Glock, legally."
He goes on to take rifle training - this time, for his own purposes. A list of ammunition purchased follows, followed itself by a minutely detailed list of other items purchased for his scheme.
Near the end, in a section titled "Social life and continuation of cover", the author explains: "I have been storing three bottles of Chateau Kirwan 1979 (French red wine) which I purchased at an auction 10 years ago with the intention of enjoying them at a very special occasion.
"Considering the fact that my martyrdom operation draws ever closer I decided to bring one to enjoy with my extended family at our annual Christmas party in December."
He goes on: "My thought was to save the last flask for my last martyrdom celebration and enjoy it with the two high class model whores I intend to rent prior to the mission."
After this, the log goes into detailed day-to-day entries for the run-up to his attack, including detailed accounts of labour-intensive explosives preparation.
At the end of the log, it reads: "I believe this will be my last entry. It is now Fri July 22nd, 12.51.
"Sincere regards, Andrew Berwick. Justiciar Knight Commander. Knights Templar Europe. Knights Templar Norway."
