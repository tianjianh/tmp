Flames could be seen shooting from the roof of Scotway House, close to the city's Riverside Museum, after the fire broke out on Friday evening.
The Scottish Fire and Rescue Service sent a number of appliances to the scene.
There were no reports of injuries, and the nearby Riverside Museum was not damaged.
Scotway House is located on a large plot of wasteland west of Yorkhill Park.
It was built in 1885 as a drawing office for ship building firm D&W Henderson at the Meadowside Shipyard, and is a category B-listed building.
The building has been empty for about 20 years. Since the doors were closed it has been considered for a pub and restaurant development and a music venue.
Last year plans were submitted to convert the building as part of a student housing development on the site.
The Glasgow Harbour area is currently undergoing a major redevelopment.
