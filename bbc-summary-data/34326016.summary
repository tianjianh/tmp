Health board special measures have 'no time limit'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
There is no time limit for keeping the health board for north Wales in special measures, the first minister has said.

Carwyn Jones said it would take "as long as it takes" to restore confidence in the Betsi Cadwaladr board.
Simon Dean was appointed interim chief executive in June in the wake of management and performance concerns.
Shadow Health Minister Darren Millar said suspended chief executive Trevor Purt was "getting paid rather well for sitting at home" for the last 100 days.
During First Minister's Questions on Tuesday, the Conservative AM asked why last week's update on the troubled health board made no mention of Mr Purt's situation.
"When will the public be able to determine what is happening in respect of leadership at that board?" Mr Millar asked.
Responding, Mr Jones said: "The acting chief executive will remain in place as long as it takes in order to make sure that confidence can be restored in the health board itself.
"There is no time limit on that - it will take as long as is needed," he said.
However, Mr Jones added that "there needs to be a conclusion with regards to the position of the previous chief executive".
The first minister also said he would write to Mr Millar on the matter of a publication date for the follow-up report on action taken following the Tawel Fan mental health treatment scandal.
Last week, Mr Dean said he had started to turn health services in north Wales around in his first 100 days in charge.
But he admitted there was still more to do with no sign of an end to special measures, imposed in June following  a series of scandals.
