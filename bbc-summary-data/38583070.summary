Nathan Jones: 'I'm delighted Luton Town are not getting fined'

Luton Town manager Nathan Jones has said he was pleased to pick a side that is likely to avoid a fine in Tuesday's 4-0 EFL Trophy win over Chesterfield.

The Hatters were fined Â£15,000 for failing to play "full-strength" squads in their opening three matches.
But, despite making seven changes against the Spireites, Jones chose five of their top 11 appearance makers.
"I'm just delighted that we've put a side out that's probably not going to get fined," said Jones.
"Not that that's been a problem, because we've not picked sides with any financial thing in place."
According to competition rules, teams have to field five players who started the previous or following game, or five who had made the most appearances this season.
On Tuesday at Kenilworth Road, Luton started Christian Walton, Jack Marriott, Glen Rea, Stephen O'Donnell and Jordan Cook - all of whom are in their top 11 appearance makers in all competitions this term.
Hatters chief executive Gary Sweet previously said the club should not be "paying 'fees' to get our youngsters experience", after playing a number of academy graduates in their group matches.
Jones continued to BBC Three Counties Radio after beating Chesterfield to reach the quarter-final: "This competition has been good for us because it's given us real competitive games that everyone gets involved in.
"Some of them have really staked their claim but others have reiterated what we already knew about them already - we've got a good competitive group."
