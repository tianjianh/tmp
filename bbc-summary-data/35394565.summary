Five-time champion Djokovic made 100 unforced errors but prevailed 6-3 6-7 (1-7) 6-4 4-6 6-3 after four hours and 32 minutes on Rod Laver Arena.
Djokovic, 28, is through to his 27th consecutive Grand Slam quarter-final.
The Serb plays Japan's Kei Nishikori in the last eight after the seventh seed beat Jo-Wilfried Tsonga 6-4 6-2 6-4.
Four-time champion and third seed Roger Federer plays Belgium's David Goffin later on Sunday, with the winner playing Tomas Berdych.
The Czech sixth seed came through a testing encounter against Spain's Roberto Bautista Agut 4-6 6-4 6-3 1-6 6-3.
"Playing against a player like Gilles you can expect a lot of rallies," said Djokovic, who is also through to his ninth successive Australian Open quarter-final.
"He is always making you play an extra shot. I made a lot of unforced errors today but he was fighting, he was playing well, physically it was very demanding and I'm just happy to get through this one."
Two breaks were enough for Djokovic to win the first set but the 10-time major champion spurned 11 break points in the second before winning the tie-break 7-1.
Djokovic broke twice again in the third but dabbed two limp drop-shots into the net when serving to stay in the set before missing a backhand to send the contest to a decider.
But Djokovic raised his game at the decisive moment, racing into a 4-1 lead in the fifth and serving out for the victory after Simon had saved two match points.
When a spectator shouted out during Djokovic's on-court interview, the defending champion asked him to repeat what he had said.
When the member of the crowd repeated "no more drop-shots", the Serb shrugged and replied: "I hate to say it, but you're absolutely right."
Djokovic's tally of unforced errors is not a record - Yevgeny Kafelnikov hit 112 in defeating Fernando Vicente at the 2000 French Open.
Nishikori broke ninth seed Tsonga's serve five times while the Frenchman hit eight double-faults in a flat display.
"Today was one of the best matches I've had this week," said 28-year-old Nishikori, a US Open finalist in 2014.
"I'm surprised that I broke him early every set. I was returning well, so that made it tough for him to have a good serve all the time."
Nishikori, 26, has never reached the semi-finals in Melbourne and trails Djokovic 5-2 in head-to-heads.
Australian Lleyton Hewitt bowed out of professional tennis when he and compatriot Sam Groth lost their men's doubles match 6-4 6-2 to American Jack Sock and Vasek Pospisil of Canada.
Hewitt, who lost to Spaniard David Ferrer in the second round of the singles, bows out at the age of 34, having won two Grand Slam titles and helping Australia lift the Davis Cup twice.
