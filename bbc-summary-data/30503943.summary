A statement from promoters confirmed the gig was off but pointed out that the incident was in no way related to the grime MC.
Wiley was due to perform at The Garage in north London as part of his Snakes and Ladders tour.
The show has been moved to "early 2015" or ticket holders can get a refund from their vendor.
A Metropolitan Police spokesman confirmed that on Monday night a 25-year-old man was admitted to hospital suffering from a gunshot wound, following an incident outside The Garage.
The man is said to be in a stable condition and it's not believed his injuries are life threatening. No arrests have been made.
Wiley was due on stage on Tuesday night with support from Mobo-winning grime MC Stormzy.
In a series of tweets Wiley said the cancellation was beyond his control.
The MC wrote: "Some things that happen are totally out of your power."
Wiley was also due in Birmingham on Thursday and Manchester on Friday but those shows have also been called off, a spokesperson for concert promoters SJM confirmed.
They said: "Following an incident which took place outside The Garage in London last night, the main venue is unable to open this evening.
"It is with regret that the venue has no option other than to cancel tonight's Wiley show, which is a decision in no way related to Wiley, his management team or his support acts."
