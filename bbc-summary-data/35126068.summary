Prospective buyers have emerged for two more privately-owned residential care homes that were earmarked for closure.

Last month, Four Seasons Health Care said it was closing seven of its homes in Northern Ireland.
On Thursday, it said it was in discussions with two care home operators about selling Hamilton Court in Armagh and Garvagh Care Home.
It comes after reaching agreement with two firms earlier this month to sell its homes in Antrim and Ballynahinch.
The prospective purchaser of Hamilton Court is the operator of Sanville Nursing Home in County Tyrone, while the firm interested in buying Garvagh Care Home is also an existing care home operator.
Four Seasons said in a statement that it had "agreed to pause consultation with the unions and employees" about the closure of the two homes.
"While the transaction is progressing the company is suggesting that residents remain at their home if that is where they would like to stay, although it is for residents and families to decide for themselves," a spokesperson said.
"The company is working with the prospective buyers to move the sale process to a speedy conclusion."
It said transfer of ownership was dependent "on a number of steps including signing legal agreements and the (independent health regulator) RQIA transferring registration of the home from Four Seasons to the purchasers".
