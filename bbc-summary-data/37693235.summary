Champions League: Borussia Monchengladbach's ones to watch against Celtic

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Borussia Monchengladbach arrive in Scotland out of form for their Champions League match against Celtic and with an injury list that has taken a sledgehammer to their squad.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Without this season's star-man so far, Thorgan Hazard, and striker Raffael, the potency of The Foals has suffered a blow.
News broke on Monday that Danish international defender Andreas Christensen - on loan from Chelsea - has picked up a gluteal muscle injury and will also miss the trip to Celtic Park.
Then on Tuesday, USA international Fabian Johnson withdrew due to illness.
On the long-term injury list are Switzerland international Josip Drmic, who has been out since March and former Atletico Madrid defender Alvaro Dominguez.
It is hardly ideal preparation for head coach Andre Schubert as his team try to stem a tide that has seen them go without a win in three matches.
As a club, they also haven't won away from home in a Champions Cup tie since getting the better of Red Star Belgrade in 1977. The current team has continued that trend with just three wins from their last 18 matches away from Borussia-Park.
So who will likely be charged with the task of overcoming a boisterous Parkhead and an in-form Celtic? Here are four players to watch:
The goalkeeper and undisputed Gladbach number one arrived to fill the gloves of Marc-Andre ter Stegen who left for Barcelona in 2014. Sommer featured in all four of Switzerland's matches at Euro 2016, though he failed to keep out any of Poland's spot-kicks as the Swiss were eliminated in the last 16 on penalties.
Sommer broke his nose against Manchester City in last season's Champions League and was a reported target for Pep Guardiola in the summer before he plundered former club Barcelona for Claudio Bravo.
Mikael Lustig's international colleague brings experience to the table.
The 30-year-old from Gothenburg was on the Copenhagen bench in the white-hot European atmosphere of Celtic Park in 2006 when Gordon Strachan's Scottish champions defeated the Danes 1-0.
Wendt got his revenge in the return later in that group stage when they reversed the outcome 3-1 in Denmark.
He and his team-mates also defeated Manchester United in that campaign though they would finish bottom of the group with Celtic reaching the last 16 for the first time. Wendt was also in the Copenhagen side that lost 4-0 to Aberdeen at Pittodrie in the Uefa Cup a season later.
The German international is no stranger to facing Scottish sides having started against the national team in Dortmund at the beginning of the campaign to reach France 2016.
The 25-year-old is a mainstay in the side having initially been on loan from Bayer Leverkusen for two seasons.
Kramer started the 2014 World Cup final against Argentina in the Maracana after the late withdrawal of injured Sami Khedira, only to be substituted early himself because of a head injury sustained in a challenge with Ezequiel Garay after half an hour.
The Gladbach captain is likely to have an even more important role than normal given most of his first choice team-mates in the final third are among the walking wounded.
Never capped by the German national team, the striker took the skipper's armband this season after his predecessor Martin Stranzl retired and former vice-captain Granit Xhaka signed for Arsenal.
Stindl can play behind the strikers or as one of them himself - he may have to out of necessity with Andre Hahn his likely partner.
