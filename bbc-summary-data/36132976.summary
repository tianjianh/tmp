The event at Parc Eirias concludes a Proms season which includes five performances at London's Royal Albert Hall.
The concert on 10 September will also be broadcast live. Tickets go on sale in May.
Rhodri Talfan Davies, director of BBC Wales, said he was delighted it was being hosted in north Wales.
Councillor Graham Rees, Conwy council cabinet member for tourism, marketing and leisure, said: "We're thrilled to welcome BBC Proms in the Park to Colwyn Bay and I'm excited to see yet another major event secured at Parc Eirias.
"Events are extremely important to Conwy county as they provide significant economic value for our many small businesses."
