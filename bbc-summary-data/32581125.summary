[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Politicians must behave like "grown ups" if no-one wins a majority on Thursday, Nick Clegg has said.

The Lib Dem leader told the party faithful in Cardiff on Tuesday that the parties will have to put the country first to find a workable solution.
Mr Clegg said the "last thing" Britain needed was "a second election before Christmas".
Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls, also in Cardiff, promised Labour would make the economy work for working people.
Leanne Wood has told disillusioned voters they can trust Plaid Cymru while Tory Welsh Secretary Stephen Crabb has been promoting tax cuts and economic growth.
Mr Clegg was visiting Cardiff on Tuesday as part of a 1,000 mile, two-day campaign road trip from Land's End to John O'Groats before polling day.
He said only the Lib Dems could provide "stability", claiming Labour and the Conservatives would create a "shambles".
"We all know that no-one is going to win the election outright on Thursday, despite what Ed Miliband and David Cameron says.
"So that means politicians will have to behave like grown ups, treat each other like grown ups and put the country first.
"Now we Liberal Democrats have put the country first over the last five years, we've shown that coalition government can work, that it's stable and that it is strong."
Mr Clegg warned that voting for the SNP, Plaid Cymru or UKIP would result in a Labour or Conservative government pulled to extreme positions.
Also on the campaign trail on Tuesday, Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls returned to Wales to drum up support for Labour in what the party called a "clarion call" to voters not to go for smaller parties and risk leaving the Conservatives in power.
"The Tories have been patting themselves on the back, saying they've fixed the economy, but who have they fixed it for?" he asked.
"For most people, their wages have not been rising, prices have been going up much faster, and we're seeing more zero hours contracts, more cuts in public services coming from the Conservatives.
"It's not working, and it's not working for working people."
For the Conservatives, Stephen Crabb stressed their role as the party of tax cuts and economic growth while visiting a supermarket in Cardiff.
Plaid Cymru leader Leanne Wood, campaigning in Cardiff city centre, urged voters to trust her party to make sure Wales' voice was heard "loud and clear" at Westminster.
Meanwhile, the Greens said they feared the controversial issue of fracking - drilling deep underground to find gas trapped in rocks - had been "deliberately buried" by the major parties.
