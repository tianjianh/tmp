Women's World Twenty20 2016: England hope to keep winning momentum

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Captain Charlotte Edwards hopes England can build on their warm-up wins when they begin their Women's World Twenty20 campaign in Bangalore on Thursday.

They will face a Bangladesh side whom they have met only once before.
Edwards told the ECB's website: "To get three games against really tough opposition was fantastic, but to get three wins was even more important.
"We've got to play well in every single game if we're going to go further in this competition."
England overcame New Zealand twice and South Africa once in warm-ups, as they prepare for a tournament they won on home soil in 2009 - but subsequently have found themselves outgunned by Australia, who were champions in 2010, 2012 and 2014.
You can watch in-game highlights of England v Bangladesh - and the later men's game between Sri Lanka and Afghanistan - on the BBC Sport website.
While many English seam bowlers traditionally flounder on the subcontinent, in Anya Shrubsole they have the leading wicket-taker across the last two Women's World Twenty20 events - who earned the player of the tournament award in 2014.
The Somerset right-armer has a better bowling average, economy rate and strike rate in both T20s and one-day internationals in Asia than she does at home.
But, speaking before the recent tour of South Africa, Shrubsole told BBC Sport: "I don't think there's any big secret.
"As an inswing bowler, on the subcontinent I'm just trying to bowl more balls that are going to hit the stumps than not.
"If you bowl too short, you're going to get whacked. A good length is normally a good length wherever you're playing."
Australia, who do not begin their title defence until Friday, are in the other group - so cannot meet England until the semi-finals at the earliest.
The Southern Stars beat England in the 2012 and 2014 finals, edged them out at the group stage in 2010 - and are now in possession of the Women's Ashes after winning last summer's multi-format series in England.
"We can't hide from the fact that they've got the better of us in recent ICC tournaments, but we showed in the Twenty20 internationals at the end of the Ashes that we can beat them," Shrubsole added.
"A lack of consistency cost us the Ashes. It's about making sure we perform on the day."
