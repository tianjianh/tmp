Millionaire cleared of dragging policeman clinging onto car

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Millionaire philanthropist Sir Harry Djanogly has been cleared of dangerous driving and assault after a policeman was hurt trying to cling onto his car.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Sgt Robert McDonald tried to get Sir Harry, 77, out of his Jaguar XJF after pulling him over for speeding on the A40 near Acton, west London.
The officer suffered knee injuries but Isleworth Crown Court accepted his did not deliberately accelerate.
Sir Harry denied dangerous driving and assaulting a police officer.
The philanthropist, who lives in Angel Court, near Pall Mall, was driving at about 70mph in a 50mph zone and told the jury he was taking his wife to hospital in December 2014, and believed "her life was in danger".
Sir Harry accepted he was speeding and during the trial apologised to the officer saying he did not intend to harm him or rev his car.
Sgt McDonald suffered knee injuries as he clung to the car when it moved forward along the dual carriageway.
Following the verdict, Sir Harry's lawyer Nick Freeman, said: "Mr Djanogly very much regrets the incident and would like to thank the court and the jury for giving his case such careful consideration."
