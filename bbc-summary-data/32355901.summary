[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man has appeared in court in Glasgow charged with murdering student Karen Buckley, whose body was found on a farm four days after she went missing.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Alexander Pacteau, 21, made no plea or declaration and was remanded in custody following the private hearing at Glasgow Sheriff Court.
Miss Buckley's body was found by police at a farm to the north of Glasgow on Thursday.
She had gone missing following a night out in the city's west end on Saturday.
Mr Pacteau, from Glasgow, is also accused of attempting to defeat the ends of justice. He will appear in court again next week for a full committal hearing.
A candlelit vigil was held in Glasgow's George Square from 17:00 on Friday in memory of Miss Buckley, with many of those attending bringing flowers and candles.
The vigil was attended by Miss Buckley's parents John and Marian as well as other family members, who were joined by hundreds of members of the public.
A separate event titled Silent Vigil For Our Neighbour Karen Buckley has been organised to take place in the Garnethill area of the city, where Miss Buckley lived, on Saturday.
Mr and Mrs Buckley visited Glasgow Caledonian University earlier on Friday, where they met some of their daughter's friends and teaching staff and looked at floral tributes that had been left.
A special prayer service was held near her home in Mallow on Wednesday, and a fundraising page set up by Miss Buckley's former classmates to support her family has raised more than Â£50,000.
Miss Buckley, 24, from Cork in Ireland, had been seen on CCTV leaving the Sanctuary nightclub with a man in the early hours of Sunday. Her friends raised the alarm after she failed to return to her flat in Hill Street.
Specialist police divers, a helicopter crew and search dogs were all involved in the search for the qualified nurse, who moved to Glasgow in February to study occupational therapy at Glasgow Caledonian University (GCU).
Her handbag was discovered in Dawsholm Park, in the Kelvinside area of the city, on Tuesday and officers later began searching land around High Craigton Farm near Milngavie.
It was announced in the early hours of Thursday that officers had found a body at the farm, which was later confirmed to be Miss Buckley.
Speaking at a police media conference on Thursday, Det Supt Jim Kerr said: "We cannot imagine the pain and suffering of Karen's family and friends and our thoughts are with them at this very sad and distressing time."
The police officer thanked members of the public in Ireland and Scotland for their assistance, and described their efforts as "very, very helpful".
Det Supt Kerr also read a statement on behalf of Karen's father John.
It said: "Marian and I, together with our sons Brendan, Kieran and Damian, are absolutely heartbroken.
"Karen was our only daughter, cherished by our family and loved by her friends. She was an outgoing girl who travelled the world where she met lots of people and thoroughly enjoyed her life. We will miss her terribly.
"We would be very grateful if we could now be left alone to grieve with her family and friends."
