[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A former Scotland U-16s football player has been jailed for two years after carrying out a six-month crime spree to fund his drug habit.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Ex-Scotland and Hearts youth player Andrew Shaw was locked up after a court heard how his life had spiralled out of control after leaving the army.
The 28-year-old, from Perth, admitted stealing televisions, a fishing rod, sat-navs and almost Â£2,000 in cash.
He was told by a sheriff he had started life as a "very promising" young man.
But Perth Sheriff Court heard Shaw had developed "a multitude of drug issues" after failing to make the breakthrough into senior football and then suffering post traumatic stress as a result of military service.
Sheriff William Wood told Shaw: "You made a very promising start to your young life. You are not alone in suffering difficulties arising from armed service.
"But not everyone goes down the path of substance misuse and a career in theft. I take into account the duration of this spree, from May to October 2015."
The court was told that Shaw stole from people he knew and was caught in the act several times. He left his DNA and fingerprints at several of the crime scenes.
He left a trail of blood in the office at Braidhaugh Caravan Park after he injured himself ripping two televisions off the wall and was later spotted on CCTV carrying one of the flatscreen TVs onto a bus.
And after stealing items from a car in Viewlands Terrace, Perth, he was spotted walking down the street with the fishing rod he had taken from the boot.
Shaw admitted 11 charges relating to offences which took place in Perth and Crieff between 30 May and 11 October last year, including breaking into nine cars.
Solicitor David Duncan, defending, said: "Mr Shaw has indicated to me that he has previously been diagnosed with post traumatic stress disorder."
