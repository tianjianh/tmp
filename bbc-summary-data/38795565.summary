The former England Under-21 international has progressed through the youth system at Goodison Park and made nine appearances for the Toffees.
Browning, 22, missed the end of last season with a knee injury that kept him out for nearly a year.
"I hope to be able to come in and make an impact," he told the club website.
"I have heard nothing but good things about the club and can't wait to get started."
