Fire crews were called to the chemistry building at The University of Bristol at about 14:30 GMT.
Nearby buildings were evacuated by police and a safety cordon put in place.
The University of Bristol confirmed the measures were a "precaution due to an unstable substance being manufactured".
There are no reports of any injuries and the substance was being "disposed of safely", a spokesman said.
Avon and Somerset Police said the fire service and an explosive ordnance disposal (EOD) team were called "at the request of the university, to assist with the disposal of the chemical".
