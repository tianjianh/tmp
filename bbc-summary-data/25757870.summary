[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
North-East Labour MSP Richard Baker highlighted the recent postponement of operations at Aberdeen Royal Infirmary as proof of a lack of funding for health services in the area.
Mr Baker said the situation had reached crisis point.
NHS Grampian has apologised to the patients affected.
It admitted that since the 6 January it has been experiencing pressure on hospital beds, resulting in a number of operations at Aberdeen Royal Infirmary being postponed.
Mr Baker told BBC Scotland: "We have had serious issues in terms of local health services. It's now absolutely clear this requires a response."
In a statement, the Scottish government said NHS Grampian and local authority partners were working very closely to address the issues, and meetings would assess what further help could be provided.
