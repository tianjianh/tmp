The Duke of Cambridge and Prince Harry presented the Legacy Awards to children and teenagers for creating positive social change in their communities.
The recipients came from the UK, United States, Canada, India, Belize and the United Arab Emirates.
The Duke paid tribute to his mother, saying she still inspires "countless acts of compassion and bravery".
He and Prince Harry were making their first joint appearance at an event run by the Diana Award, established to promote their mother's belief in the positive power of young people.
Award winners included a teenager from North Yorkshire who set up a swimming club for young people with disabilities.
Jemima Browning, 16, who started Tadcaster Stingrays, was inspired by her brother Will, 14, who has Down's Syndrome.
She said he often experienced barriers to competing in sport due to his disabilities and the additional support he requires.
"It doesn't feel real, it feels really strange it feels like I don't deserve something amazing like this," she said.
"To be able to stand in front of two amazing people who are recognized across the world is just a massive honour and I can't believe it really."
The Duke of Cambridge said: "We are so glad our mothers name is being put to good use through The Diana Award."
The winners were selected from a poll of nominations by an independent judging panel chaired by Dame Julia Cleverdon, founder of Step Up To Serve.
The panel included Julia Samuel, Patron of Child Bereavement UK and friend of Princess Diana, and campaigner Baroness Lawrence OBE.
Those to receive awards (as well as Jemima) were:
