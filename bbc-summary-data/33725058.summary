Emmerdale visitor tours 'provisionally approved'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A plan to allow visitors to tour the set of TV soap Emmerdale has been "provisionally approved".

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Leeds City Council said its chief planner wanted to fully consider issues with such things as highways and heritage before finalising a decision.
The fictional village was built in 1998 in the grounds of Grade I listed Harewood House, north of Leeds.
A number of objections to the plan were received citing concerns over increased traffic and access to public footpaths.
The joint application by the estate and ITV proposes weekend tours by up to two coach loads of visitors an hour.
No new development is planned at the site, which lies on green belt land.
