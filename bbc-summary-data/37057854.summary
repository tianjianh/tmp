Two six-year-old girls were sexually assaulted during a trip to Legoland.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Thames Valley Police said the girls were "touched inappropriately" at the Legoland Windsor Resort between about 12.15 BST and 12.30 BST on Thursday.
The offender was described as a white man in his teens or early twenties. He was wearing dark-coloured clothing and trainers.
Legoland said it was "deeply shocked" and "nothing of this nature" had ever taken place at the resort before.
Det Insp Penny Mackenzie said: "I would ask anyone who visited the Legoland Windsor Resort yesterday [Thursday], especially if you went to Castaway Camp in Pirate Shores, to check any photographs from your trip to see if you recognise anyone matching the offender.
"Such offences are extremely rare and we are working closely with Legoland to identify the suspect."
