A murder inquiry is under way after Brian McKandie was found at Fairview Cottages in Badenscoth, Rothienorman, on Saturday 12 March.
Two men were reportedly seen speaking to him on the Friday beforehand.
His family said in a statement issued by Police Scotland: "We have been shocked by the recent events".
The statement said: "Brian was a dearly beloved brother of William, Margaret and the late Elizabeth, brother-in-law, uncle and friend to many.
"He was a genial sort of chap with a dry sense of humour. He was hard-working and very dedicated to his business."
Det Ch Insp Iain Smith, of Police Scotland, said: "We believe Mr McKandie was assaulted within his home between the evening of Friday 11 March and Saturday 12 March and we are urging anyone who may have spoken to him to come forward.
"Understandably, Mr McKandie's family and friends are devastated by his death and it is vital we piece together the events that led up to this horrific crime and the motive for such an attack."
