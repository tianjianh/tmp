The accident happened at a factory in the Ballyconnell Road area of Derrylin on Thursday morning.
Mr Maguire was part of the Fermanagh senior football squad.
He played in the half-forward line in the Ulster SFC quarter-final defeat by Down at Brewster Park in June this year.
He also played in two of Fermanagh's McKenna Cup games in January and in four National League games for the county.
Mr Maguire also helped his club, Lisnaskea, reach their first Fermanagh senior club final since 1996 this year, after captaining the team to All-Ireland intermediate success last year.
Fermanagh GAA County Secretary, Tom Boyle, said he was shocked and saddened by Mr Maguire's death.
"I would have spoken to him as recently as Wednesday night," he said.
"He was in good form, he was a very quiet unassuming lad and a very regular and committed player to both his club and the county."
In a statement, Fermanagh GAA said all club matches had been cancelled this weekend as a mark of respect.
Ulster GAA Council President Aogán Ó Fearghail said Mr Maguire was a "committed Gael" who had represented his club and county "with great distinction".
"I express the Ulster Council's and my own deep and heartfelt sympathy to Brian Og's parents Brian and Eileen, his sisters Roisin and Eimear, his entire family circle and his club," he added.
In a statement the Quinn Group said: "It is with great sadness that we confirm that an accident occurred at our Pre-Stress plant in Derrylin this morning, as a result of which one of our staff members was fatally injured.
"The accident occurred shortly after 10am and emergency first aid was applied at the scene.
"Unfortunately, he passed away on the way to hospital.
"We are all extremely shocked and we extend our deepest sympathies to the family, friends and colleagues of the deceased. An investigation into the cause of the accident has commenced."
