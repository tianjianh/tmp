Managers at Aberdeen International Airport have expressed "cautious optimism" that passenger numbers will improve next year, following a better month for traffic.

Nearly 238,000 passengers used the airport in November, which was 4.1% down on the same month last year.
However, the airport said it was the smallest fall since April last year.
Aberdeen has seen a lengthy decline in traffic following the downturn in the North Sea oil and gas industry.
Last month, international and domestic numbers were down year-on-year by 6.8% and 1.6% respectively, with helicopter traffic down 8.5%.
Airport managing director Carol Benzie said: "Whilst we did experience a year-on-year decrease in passenger numbers in November as a result of the continued North Sea oil downturn, it was the smallest drop we've experienced in many months.
"This gives me cautious optimism that we may see numbers begin to improve in the New Year, particularly with the exciting new routes and services we are due to launch.
"Both Air Baltic and Ryanair are due to return in 2017 with new flights to our passengers' most requested destinations, and Loganair announced just last week that it will launch a link between Aberdeen and the stunning Faroe Islands next summer."
The airport is currently undergoing a Â£20m revamp, which will increase the size of the existing terminal by 50%.
New domestic and international baggage reclaim areas are also being built. They are expected to be ready for passengers to use next summer.
Meanwhile, both Edinburgh and Glasgow airports reported a record November for passengers.
Edinburgh said just under 861,000 passengers passed through its doors - 8.3% more than the same month last year.
Its figures were boosted by a year-on-year rise of 19.6% in international passenger numbers.
However, domestic traffic was down by 1%.
Airport chief executive Gordon Dewar said: "In what is traditionally one of the quiet months in aviation we have witnessed a 20% increase in passengers on international flights.
"We also have a healthy equilibrium of inbound and outbound passengers with the most balanced mix of any UK airport outside London."
Glasgow also reported its busiest November, as numbers climbed by 7.7% to more than 666,000.
The airport said international traffic was up 14.9% on last year as a result of increased demand for winter sun destinations on Ryanair and Jet2 routes.
EU scheduled services were up by 25% and there was an increase in traffic on Emirates and Virgin long-haul routes.
Domestic traffic in November increased by 2.2% thanks to strong demand from both business and leisure travellers on London services.
