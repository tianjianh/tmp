Apple is warning users of its latest Macbook Pro about an issue with the laptop that may cause data corruption.

The tech giant released a firmware update on Wednesday to fix a problem on the laptop's flash storage component.
The 15-inch mid 2015 range Retina model is affected, with corruption occurring in "rare cases", the company said.
News of the warning comes as thousands of Macbook owners are campaigning for action over stains appearing on the laptop's retina screen.
Users that have been affected by stains spreading across their laptop screens are worried about the expensive service fees they will have to pay once the warranties or protection plans expire.
However, the firmware update on the latest model does not sound like a major problem at the moment, said Stuart Miles, founder of gadget news site Pocket-lint.
"It's not like a massive product recall in the same light as a car that has a faulty brake," he told the BBC.
The newest 15in Macbook Pro is the slimmest and lightest to date and sells for a starting price of Â£1,599.
