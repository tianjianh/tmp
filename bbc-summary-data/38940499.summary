[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Wes York saw a speculative volley go just wide after six minutes, but he turned provider 15 minutes later as Danny Johnson put the hosts in front.
Jake Gosling hit a post as the visitors tried to get back into it, but Johnson was ruthless as he smashed in from the edge of the box on the half-hour mark to take his tally to 14 goals this season.
Kaiyne Woolery pulled one back for Forest Green after 49 minutes, but York restored Gateshead's two-goal advantage with a superb strike from distance seven minutes later.
