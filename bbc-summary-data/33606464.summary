A golfer who made a hole in one at The Open just days ago has been left without his clubs after they went astray during a flight to Switzerland.

Daniel Brooks, of Basildon, arrived in Switzerland for the next stage in the European tour without his clubs.
He tweeted saying that after his clubs were lost, Easyjet then sent them to the wrong place for collection.
The travel firm has apologised and said it hoped to reunite Brooks with his clubs soon.
In the tweet, Brooks said: "First you lose my golf clubs. Then I fill out a form for where they need to go to and you take them somewhere else. What's going on?"
Easyjet then responded suggesting he contacted its baggage claims department.
Brooks asked for his clubs to be sent to him at the Swiss golf complex in Crans-Montana. It is understood they have instead been sent to Gatwick Airport 483 miles (777km) away.
When he struck the hole in one at the 166 yard 11th hole, Brooks became the first golfer to make a hole-in-one at The Open at St Andrews since 1990, and the first in any Open since 2012.
His father Mick Brooks said: "His clubs had not arrived. His manager has been trying to sort out where his clubs are. They are all sized up for him.
"I hope they turn up before he kicks off on Thursday."
An Easyjet spokeswoman said: "We apologise for any inconvenience experienced.
"We are investigating this thoroughly with our ground staff and baggage handling partners and hope to reunite the passenger with their baggage today."
