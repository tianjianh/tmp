Councillors have been "inundated" with complaints over proposals for a zorbing centre near Menai Bridge, Anglesey.

The centre, which would see people roll down a hill in a giant plastic ball, has been planned for the banks of the Menai Strait.
Councillor Alun Mummery said it was the proposed location people were unhappy about.
The company behind the plans, Zorb Snowdonia, said the activity was "very low impact".
About 100 people went to a meeting in Llanfairpwll on Thursday night, organised by Plaid Cymru AM Rhun ap Iorwerth.
Representatives of Zorb Snowdonia were there, handing out leaflets and answering questions.
Mr Mummery, chairman of Llanfairpwll Community Council, said: "I've been inundated with complaints about this. I don't think the area is suitable. It's an area of outstanding natural beauty. It's untouched and that is the way that people want it to remain.
"I am sure that the people of Menai Bridge do want it. But the location has to be looked at again."
Tom Ashwell, owner of Anglesey-based adventure boat tour company, Ribride, said he had no opinion about the actual position of the centre, but added: "We are for anything that brings more tourism to the island, and that brings quality activities to tourists."
Anna Matthews from Zorb Snowdonia, said they chose the site because "people want to visit beautiful areas".
"We also think it fits in well with the Anglesey Development Plan, and plans for developments in areas of outstanding natural beauty," she said.
"The plans have been designed so that you wouldn't see the site for the National Trust's viewing areas overlooking the Menai Strait."
An Anglesey council spokesperson said planning officers were currently assessing the application and will present their recommendation to the planning committee in October.
