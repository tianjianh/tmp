Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker declared 13 August "Purple Hearts for Healing" Day for the unnamed girl.
In a statement, her family thanked him for honouring "our little hero".
She was stabbed 19 times by two girls who told police it was in "dedication" to Slenderman, a fictional character on the website Creepypasta.
The family has been raising money for her medical bills and several Wisconsin businesses have come forward to host fundraisers.
"The compassion and love expressed to our family by the people of Wisconsin [and from people around the world] has greatly assisted our family in this healing process," the family said in a statement.
"The prayers, cards, hearts, notes, financial support, and now this heartfelt proclamation truly demonstrates that through this tragedy that there is so much goodness in the world."
One of the two accused has been deemed mentally unfit to stand trial.
Morgan Geyser, 12, and classmate Anissa Weier, 12, have been charged as adults with attempted murder and face up to 60 years in prison.
Mr Walker's proclamation includes an invitation to join him in wearing purple in the girl's honour.
"This little girl is overcoming a terrible ordeal," he said in a statement.
"Her strength and determination are an inspiration, and on behalf of Wisconsin, I wish her well as she continues her journey to recovery."
According to police, the girls planned to stab the classmate during a sleepover but instead decided to commit the crime the next morning in a nearby park.
Following their arrest they told investigators about their belief in paranormal figure Slenderman and their desire to become his "proxies" by killing to demonstrate their loyalty, police said.
The victim was found by a cyclist after crawling from the woods with stab wounds to her arms, legs and torso.
Doctors said the knife had just missed a major artery near her heart.
