Britain's Gordon Reid moved closer to a place in the Wheelchair Masters Singles semi-finals and the end-of-year world number one slot with his second win out of two in the group stages.

The Paralympic champion beat the world number four Gustavo Fernandez 6-1 6-2.
There were also victories for British trio Alfie Hewett, Lucy Shuker and Andy Lapthorne.
However, Grand Slam doubles winner Jordanne Whiley will miss the rest of the tournament with a wrist injury.
Following his opening three-set win over Sweden's Stefan Olsson on Wednesday, Reid, the world number two, was too strong for Fernandez and will face Dutchman Maikel Scheffers in his final group game on Friday.
"It was some of the best tennis I've played," he said. "I was aggressive and served well."
Teenager Hewitt claimed his first Masters win with a 6-0 6-3 success over France's Nicolas Peifer and a win over world number one Stephane Houdet on Friday will secure a semi-final berth.
Shuker, the British women's number two, battled hard against 2015 beaten finalist Sabine Ellebrock of Germany before coming through 1-6 6-3 6-4 and will face Jiske Griffioen, the world number one, with the winner advancing to the last four.
Lapthorne easily secured his spot in Saturday's quad semi-finals, beating Korea's Kyu-Seung Kim 6-2 6-2.
