Leicestershire's Neil Dexter was finally dismissed for 136 on a rain-hit second day against Gloucestershire.

The all-rounder added 29 to his overnight 107 not out before a superb slip catch by Chris Dent ended his 86-run stand with Clint McKay.
Australian McKay raced to a 47-ball half-century before he miscued Liam Norwell (4-72) and was caught for 55.
The home side were eventually all out  for 334 and Gloucestershire replied with 69-0 before bad weather arrived.
Only 45.3 overs were bowled in the day, with Dent 34 not out and Gareth Roderick on 23 not out when the umpires took the players off the field in mid-afternoon.
And umpires Steve Garratt and Nigel Cowley abandoned play for the day just before 17:00 BST.
Meanwhile, Leicestershire's elite development coach Keith Piper has left the club by mutual consent for family reasons.
Leicestershire's on-loan seam bowler Richard Jones told BBC Radio Leicester:
"It's good to be back. It's a great opportunity for myself to be playing some competitive cricket.
"It went pretty well for me today, I'd obviously have liked a wicket or two, but I felt ok.
"It's pretty placid, and seems to be getting slower, but it's one of those pitches where if you hang in there and keep stacking the balls in the right area consistently, you can chip our two or three in quick succession.
"It's just going to be a patience game. You just need to hit short of a good length and be as patient as you can."
