Election 2015: Telford's new MP is sworn in

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Telford's new MP Lucy Allan has officially moved into Westminster and she kindly let me tag along as she felt her way along the corridors of power for the first time.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Unlike many MPs, her office is based in the historical House of Commons, accessible via a secret tunnel which weaves under the main road - linking the old with the new.
As we sat and had a coffee, the Conservative MP spoke of what a rollercoaster the last few weeks had been and what lay ahead.
"I'm settling in and starting to feel at home," she said.
"It has been a complete whirlwind to be honest because we had the election campaign and the council results the next day.
"I literally bundled one outfit into a bag, hotfooted it to London and lived in the one outfit for a week as we had an induction."
As we chatted, Lucy anxiously checked her watch as she had to be at 10 Downing Street for an important meeting - a coffee with David Cameron.
As I walked with her up Whitehall and towards Downing Street we reflected on her ancestor Janey Allan who had been a suffragette and was arrested in 1912 for a window-smashing raid in London.
She was sentenced to four months in prison.
"She was very much a part of the Pankhurst movement and she was force-fed in Holloway," Ms Allan said.
"I think it's really important to remember that people did struggle for the vote for women and I'm very much committed to bringing more women into politics but also encouraging more people to get out and vote."
Lucy Allan becomes only the second woman to represent a parliamentary seat in Shropshire.
Her victory in Telford completed a Tory clean-sweep of the county. It also brought to an end David Wright's 14-year run and Labour's dominance in the seat.
I watched as the new MP waited her turn to swear allegiance to the Queen and officially take up her role.
The line shuffled along towards the dispatch box, normally synonymous with Prime Minister's Questions. Once there Ms Allan laid her hand on the Bible and was sworn in.
Speaker of the House, John Bercow told her to be "part of the cast and not the audience".
She told me that she took that to mean she should get involved in debates and fight for what's best for her constituents in Shropshire.
Now the hard work begins in earnest.
