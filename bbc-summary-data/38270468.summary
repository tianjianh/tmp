Ospreys head coach Steve Tandy says they will not get carried away by the form of young winger Keelan Giles.

Giles scored twice in their 7-59 win at Grenoble in the European Challenge Cup, including a stunning solo try.
The 18-year-old has scored 11 tries in seven games this season, including five tries in two games in France after his hat-trick against Lyon in October.
"It's an incredible try but I've said a few times, it's about his general game," Tandy told BBC Radio Wales.
The teenager earned a senior Wales call-up for their autumn internationals but Tandy played down his performance against the French Top 14 side.
"It's an incredible moment but that's not the only thing that wins you games. At the end of the day, we're not going to get carried away by this," he added.
"Both wings are picking up tries and Keelan's pickup is just unbelievable. It's one moment [the try] and there will be tougher games."
The Welsh region face Grenoble again at home in eight days' time but Tandy says he is not looking far ahead in the tournament despite remaining unbeaten in the Challenge Cup.
"If we get a home win [against Grenoble] then we're in total control of the group and hopefully then we can push on for a home quarter-final," Tandy continued.
"We're not looking too far ahead. If we beat Grenoble then we're in pretty good shape around this tournament."
