[SN]TITLE[SN]
England women beaten by China despite Eniola Aluko goal

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Eniola Aluko's first-half goal was not enough to prevent England losing 2-1 to hosts China at the three-team CFA International Tournament.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Shuang Wang scored twice for China before Chelsea forward Aluko notched her 33rd international goal with a low finish from the left side of the box.
Midfielder Jill Scott went close after half-time while her Manchester City team-mate, keeper Karen Bardsley, saved to prevent England conceding a third.
England play Australia on 27 October.
England are ranked fifth in the world, 10 places above China who they beat 2-1 in the build-up to last summer's World Cup, where they reached the semi-finals.
Coach Mark Sampson gave a first start to Chelsea's Gilly Flaherty and Drew Spence and Laura Coombs also made their international debuts as second-half substitutes in Yongchuan.
Aluko did have a chance to equalise Wang's opening strike but failed to convert after being set-up by Lianne Sanderson, dragging her shot wide.
England's other opportunity of note fell to Izzy Christiansen but the Manchester City player failed to get a clean connection on Lucy Bronze's cut-back.
