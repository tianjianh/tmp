[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Billy Sharp rescued a point for League One leaders Sheffield United as they drew at home against promotion rivals Scunthorpe.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Paddy Madden opened the scoring early in the second half for the visitors, who had Harry Toffolo sent off, but the Blades responded quickly through Sharp's close-range volley.
The home side started well as Sharp fired just over the crossbar after Daniel Lafferty's ball in from the left and then Mark Duffy struck wide after a neat give and go with Sharp in the box.
Scunthorpe took the lead through Madden in the 47th minute after Stephen Dawson broke into the penalty area and crossed for the unmarked striker to tap in.
The Blades were soon back on level terms though as Sharp volleyed the ball home from inside the six-yard box two minutes later.
In the 51st minute Scunthorpe's Toffolo was shown a straight red card for a wild challenge on Kieron Freeman.
The home side piled on the pressure as John Fleck's 25-yard effort flew over and substitute Caolan Lavery's shot was parried away.
Madden thought he had won it for Scunthorpe in the 87th minute, but his close-range effort rebounded off a post and Blades substitute Jay O'Shea's last-minute curling effort also hit a post.
