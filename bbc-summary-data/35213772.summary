Liam Hewitson, 22, was attacked by his male pit bull-cross called Trigger in his Preston home on Friday and sustained injuries to his face and neck.
He was treated by paramedics at the scene but later died.
The dog, which was not a banned breed, has been put down.
Mr Hewitson's family said he was "a happy lad who was always smiling and had lots of friends".
A family statement read: "He had a beautiful personality and he will be missed by his dad Phil, girlfriend Jess and sisters Melissa and Aleisha and brother Cordell."
Mr Hewitson had owned Trigger since birth. The dog was five or six years old, police said.
Lancashire Police said they were treating the incident, which happened on Dundonald Street at around 15:45 GMT, as a tragic accident and there would be no criminal investigation.
Bunches of flowers have been left at the scene and mourners took part in a candlelit vigil on Friday night.
Paramedics were said to have been outside the house for about three hours.
Neighbour Misbah Saeed, 40, said: "He was very pleasant. I would see him with the dog often, it was fine, I'd walked past it myself so many times. I'm surprised. I'm just shocked, to me the dog seemed okay.
"He was one of the most polite, caring gentlemen, an absolute gentleman. It's a massive loss, I don't think the street will be the same again."
