England will host Spain in a friendly at Wembley on Tuesday, 15 November.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Sam Allardyce's side will play the 2010 World Cup winners four days after their World Cup 2018 qualifier against Scotland.
Like England, Spain had a disappointing Euro 2016 campaign - also exiting at the last-16 stage after a 2-0 defeat by Italy.
The two countries last met in a friendly in November 2015, with Spain winning 2-0.
