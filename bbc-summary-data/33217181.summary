Coastguards in Cowes, Newport, Bembridge and the Needles formed the rescue team at the site of a recent major landslide, east of Castle Point.
Paramedics and firefighters were also on hand to help the woman who was in "considerable pain" from a leg injury.
The RNLI said it lifted her out of the hole using a flexible stretcher.
The lifeboats were launched at about 02:30 BST.
A spokesman said: "After then being transferred to another stretcher she was lifted over a high wall and put aboard the Cowes Atlantic 85 lifeboat, which fortunately could get close inshore because of the high tide.
"Accompanied by a male friend and a paramedic, the woman was then taken by lifeboat to the Gridiron landing at East Cowes."
The woman was taken to St Mary's Hospital in Newport.
