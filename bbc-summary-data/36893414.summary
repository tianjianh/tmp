Former Aston Villa manager Little, 62, returned to the director of football role at the Jersey Football Association after leading the team to victory over Guernsey in May's Muratti Vase.
Cassidy took charge for a friendly against Clyde after Little left.
He was also Jersey's assistant manager when the island side represented England at the Uefa Regions' Cup.
Cassidy, whose first matches as manager will be on a two-match trip to France, has kept on the same coaching staff but will appoint a new assistant manager soon.
He told BBC Radio Jersey: "I'm really proud. I'm looking forward to getting the squad together for France and getting the two matches under our belts and then it's about planning for the Island Games which I've wanted to be involved in after we won gold in 2009.
"I want to try to emulate that and get that feel good factor into Jersey football and continue the great work we've done this year already."
As well as the senior team, Cassidy will also take charge of the Jersey Under-21 side.
