Events will take place internationally to mark the anniversary of the liberation of the Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration camp.
A national service at Cardiff City Hall will see Holocaust survivor Eva Clarke speak about her experiences.
Events are also being held in Wrexham, Llandudno, Caldicot and Pontypool.
Dyfed-Powys Police flags will be flown at half-mast, while in Merthyr Tydfil a permanent garden of reflection has been created by the Holocaust Memorial Day Trust.
First Minister Carwyn Jones said: "It is our duty to keep the memory of those who died alive, so we always remember how fortunate we are to live in a tolerant and humane society and ensure that such atrocities are never repeated."
