New survey examines impact of Gaelic media on learning

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The influence of Gaelic media on learning of the language is being examined.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Big Gaelic Survey has been commissioned by the language's development body, Bòrd na Gàidhlig.
The study of media, such as BBC Alba and BBC Radio nan Gàidheal, has three questionnaires.
They are aimed at Gaelic speakers, Gaelic learners and people who are interested in learning Gaelic in the future.
Shona MacLennan, of Bòrd na Gàidhlig, said: "Bòrd na Gàidhlig wants to understand better how people learn and enhance their Gaelic skills.
"It is paramount for planning and developing the language that we understand how the media helps Gaelic speakers, learners, and those interested in learning access the language.
"This is the first time research such as this has been undertaken and it will enable us to measure just how important the media is in growing Gaelic."
