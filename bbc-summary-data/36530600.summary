One-Day Cup: Warwickshire against Derbyshire abandoned at Edgbaston

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Heavy rain saw the One-Day Cup match between Warwickshire and Derbyshire at Edgbaston called off without a ball being bowled.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Days of wet weather in Birmingham had left the outfield damp and without any sign of conditions improving, the umpires abandoned the game 10 minutes after the scheduled 14:00 BST start.
Both sides take a point and Derbyshire remain unbeaten in the North Group.
Warwickshire have won just one of their four matches and sit fifth.
