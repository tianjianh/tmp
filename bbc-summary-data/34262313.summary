Britain's only pier built around an island and a boat store of "worldwide importance" are among this year's top 10 most endangered buildings.

The Victorian Society has published its annual list of the most at-risk Victorian and Edwardian buildings in England and Wales.
Actor and Victorian Society vice-president Griff Rhys Jones said the buildings needed the public's help.
A palatial house in Conwy, dubbed the "discount Downton", also made the list.
Jones has recorded a video asking people to help publicise the list, which is nominated by members of the public, because "they are buildings that need help and we need you to help them".
Director of the Victorian Society Christopher Costelloe said: "All the buildings in this year's top 10 are listed buildings, meaning that the government has recognised their national importance.
"These buildings illustrate Britain's history in tangible form. All of them deserve better than their current situations."
