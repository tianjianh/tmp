The 21-year-old hit a final-round two-under 72 to win the English Women's Amateur Championship on Thursday.
But Giles, who is part of the England Performance Squad, said she would lose the chance to play for her country if she turned professional.
"Turning professional is something I want to achieve in the future," Giles told BBC Radio Cornwall.
"At the moment I'm in the England Performance Squad, I'm really enjoying that and I want to see how far I can get playing for their teams."
Giles also won the English Women's Open strokeplay title last year and claimed the English mid-amateur Championship in 2014.
After winning the three top accolades in England Giles now wants to move up a level in the amateur game.
"I've won all the English titles but I'd really like to win a British title," she added.
"At the end of August it's the British strokeplay championship in Belfast. I'm really hoping I can put a good performance out for that one."
