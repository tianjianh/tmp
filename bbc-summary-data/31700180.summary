[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Naz Shah, a women's rights campaigner, will stand for the party in May's General Election.
The seat is held by the Respect Party's George Galloway, who took it from Labour in a by-election in 2012.
Ms Ali, from London, stood down less than a week after being selected citing "massive disruption" to family life.
Speaking after her resignation, Ms Ali said: "I am the mother of two children and, despite my best efforts to make arrangements to bring them to Bradford for the next 70 days, particularly as one of them is doing her GCSEs, this would have caused massive disruption at a critical time."
Mr Galloway claimed the "real reason" for her withdrawal was the the "war inside Bradford West Labour Party".
In a statement following the announcement of her selection, Ms Shah said: "I'm proud to have been chosen as the Labour Party's candidate for the seat in which I was born and am proud to call home.
"I am someone with a track record of campaigning and working for grass roots change and promise that if elected I will be a visible presence for Bradford West constituents and a stark alternative to divisive figure George Galloway."
According to the Labour Party, Ms Shah is the chair of mental health charity Sharing Voices Bradford.
She previously worked as a carer for children and adults with disabilities and spent time as a NHS Commissioner and director of a regional leadership programme for local government.
