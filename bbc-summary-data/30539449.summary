Christmas television highlights: What you should be watching

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
There's bound to be at least one television programme you're looking forward to watching this Christmas.

Maybe you're a Doctor Who fan, or you can't wait for the Big Fat Quiz of the Year, or you love Downton Abbey?
Charlotte Moore has already seen every festive show going out on BBC One.
She's the controller of the channel and it's her job to make sure that there's "something for everyone to watch" over the holidays.
"It's such an important part of the year's schedule for me," she says and even though she's already seen the shows, she'll still be watching TV on Christmas Day.
"There's something incredibly nice about sitting around with your family and watching them enjoy the programmes as well."
According to Charlotte, it's all about planning.
"My advice would be don't panic if you've got to go to church in the morning and you're going to miss something you really want to see or if you're going to miss something in the evening because you've got a family dinner.
"When you're trying to work out the best moment to have Christmas dinner - you can't have it in the middle of Doctor Who can you - but you can plan."
And if you work it out in advance, then you can let other people watch the channel of their choice and then you can catch up later.
"The great thing is iPlayer allows you to watch it at any time."
Charlotte expects the media to report on Christmas ratings, as they do every year, but she says the audience figures are not her priority.
"The most important thing is for people to feel there's a really rich offering across the Christmas period."
Don't Tell the Bride: Let it Snow!: 22 December, 9pm, BBC Three - Emma wants an upmarket wedding but Steve has plans to base the big day on an animated Christmas film.
Strictly Come Dancing Christmas Special: 25 December, 5pm, BBC One - Bruce Forsyth is back in the ballroom as six celebrities compete for the glitterball trophy.
Doctor Who: 25 December, 6.15pm, BBC One - The Doctor and Clara meet Santa in a brand new adventure for the Time Lord.
Marvel Avengers Assemble: 26 December, 8.30pm, BBC One - Earth's mightiest heroes - Iron Man, Captain America and Thor - must work with with agents Black Widow and Hawkeye to save the planet.
Esio Trot: 1 January, 6.30pm, BBC One - Dustin Hoffman and Judi Dench star in this children's book adaptation about a man, a woman and a tortoise.
Like many people, Charlotte also looks forward to the classics, when it comes to festive television.
"We've got 101 Dalmatians which is one of my favourites. I love that film and knowing that I'll be able to sit there with my kids watching it again will be a real treat.
"I love those classic episodes of The Vicar of Dibley or Royle Family.
"Christmas is about feeling that you're with the things you love and as much as there's fantastic new content, I think it's really nice that people have some of their favourite films to watch too."
