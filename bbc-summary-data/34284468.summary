Passengers said they heard a banging sound as the Jet2 aircraft prepared to land and were were then told to brace for impact.
The flight from Barcelona with 144 people on board, landed 30 minutes late at 14:40 BST.
The pilot called for assistance citing a "technical indication", the company said.
Passenger Rowan Franks said: "There was a large banging from the engine and vibrations throughout the aircraft and then we could see some flames coming from behind the engine.
"The pilot told us to get into the brace position. I was trying to keep calm and keep my girlfriend calm.
"There were a few panicked faces around and few tears here and there."
Another holidaymaker Laura Benson said: "There was quite a lot of banging when we were flying, the captain came on saying he wasn't sure what was happening.
"We were circling for about half an hour. He said we were going to try to land. The crew were going up and down telling us how to get into brace position.
"Everything just flashed before you. We were obviously panicking but (the pilot) sounded calm which was quite reassuring.
"I'm still shaking. I'm happy to be here and my dad is happy he's got his brandy so it's fine."
