Services through Queen Street station were disrupted until 19:00 BST on Thursday with trains to the valleys, Penarth, Barry Island and between Coryton and Radyr affected.
Buses replaced trains for the Vale of Glamorgan line in both directions.
Arriva Trains Wales said the lorry hit the bridge in Bute Street at 13:00 BST.
Trains were delayed for up to 45 minutes through Queen Street.
Arriva described the lorry which hit the bridge as "over-height", but it is unclear what happened to it after the collision.
Network Rail said engineers were immediately sent to carry out a safety inspection on the bridge.
A spokesman said: "Engineers found that there was no damage to the bridge. Services were able to run at normal speed over the bridge at 13:50 BST."
