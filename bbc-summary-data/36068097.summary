Fermanagh rider Lee Johnston looks set to be fit for next month's North West 200 after suffering minor injuries in a crash at Oliver's Mount in Scarborough.

Johnston suffered bruising to his pelvis and leg in the accident during the feature race on Sunday, and also sustained "a few pulled muscles".
Johnston was discharged from hospital on Sunday night but returned on Monday morning for a check-up.
The 27-year-old has won three races at the North West in the last two years.
Johnston raced to a Supertwins double at the NW200 in 2014 before securing a Superstock win in 2015.
Isle of Man rider Billy Redmayne suffered serious injuries in a separate crash at the Spring Cup meeting and the event was subsequently abandoned.
A spokesman for the event said the 25-year-old Manxman had been taken to Middlesbrough Hospital where he is "undergoing treatment for his injuries".
He added that he is "breathing on his own and his condition is improving".
Redmayne won the Junior Manx Grand Prix last year and is regarded as one of the brightest prospects in the sport.
His crash came after the feature Spring Cup race had been re-started after the incident involving Johnston.
The organisers were forced to abandon the meeting in North Yorkshire because of a lack of medical cover at the course following the crashes.
