Lincoln took the lead on 16 minutes when Jamie McCombe met Greg Tempest's cross with a fine header past goalkeeper Shwan Jalal.
Danny Whitehead then equalised for the Silkmen with an excellent long-range strike just five minutes into the second half.
Both goalkeepers were tested late on but neither side could find a winner.
Lincoln lie 10th, six points off fifth-placed Tranmere, six points above 13th-placed Macc.
Imps manager Chris Moyses told BBC Radio Lincolnshire:

"It was probably a good game for the neutral. They had chances, we had chances and it was quite open at times but we came to win.
"We were desperate for the second goal which wasn't forthcoming. We counter-attacked more in the second half and maybe could have done it better.
"We got the ball in good areas but then gave it straight back and we gave a lot of stupid free-kicks away which gave them the momentum."
