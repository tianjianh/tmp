Police appealed for the mother to come forward, saying she may require urgent medical attention.
Officers were at the scene off Edgeway Road in Marston, Oxford, where Thames Valley Police received a report of a dead baby at 09:20 GMT.
The 999 call handler reported that the child's body was found off the path in bushes, wrapped in a black bag.
Det Insp Jim Holmes said: "If you are the mother of the baby, please come forward so we can ensure any help needed can be provided."
He said the death was being treated as unexplained.
South Central Ambulance Service said it was called to reports of a baby being found by the side of the road.
A spokesman said the baby was declared dead at the scene.
Police have cordoned off a wide area, where forensic teams are working to gather evidence.
A passer-by said: "I am surprised, I realised they must have found something in the woods as the path is closed.
"I am used to walking this way and there are always people coming and going.
"I am very sorry to hear this news."
