A statement from the film's production company Alcon Entertainment confirmed the accident occurred on a soundstage at Origo Studios.
It said the worker was "underneath a platform, upon which the set was constructed, when it suddenly collapsed".
The cause of the accident is not yet known.
A Hungarian news website, Index, reported the worker had been dismantling the set as production had already moved to another location.
The untitled sequel to Blade Runner, which will star Ryan Gosling, Harrison Ford and Jared Leto, is due to be released next autumn.
The sequel to the 1982 sci-fi film is being directed by Denis Villeneuve, who was also behind Sicario and Prisoners filmmaker.
