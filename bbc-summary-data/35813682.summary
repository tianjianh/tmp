Ricky Burns can become a great of Scottish boxing - Morrison

Ricky Burns will become one of the greats of Scottish boxing if he wins a world title at a third different weight, according to Alex Morrison.

Burns will face Michele di Rocco for the vacant WBA light-welterweight belt in Glasgow on 28 May.
"You're talking about Ken Buchanan, Jim Watt and Walter McGowan," Burns' manager Morrison said.
"For Ricky to win at three different weights would put him up there with them - true greats."
After securing the first of his world crowns at super featherweight in 2010 against Puerto Rican Roman Martinez, Burns won the interim WBO lightweight title a year later against Michael Katsidis from Australia, going on to make four successful defences.
But after losing his belt to American Terrance Crawford in March 2014, Burns, who turns 33 next month, now has a shot at reaching the top again.
"He wants to show the world how good he is," Morrison said.
"He's hungry for a third world title. The move to super lightweight was the only option to get him a shot but he's shown in the past how versatile he is in making weights so I think it's good for him."
Morrison also believes fighting in front of Scottish fans will be a "massive boost" for the Coatbridge boxer and that it could play a significant factor against the Italian Di Rocco, who is unbeaten in almost nine years.
"Ricky loves fighting in front of his own fans," added Morrison.
"The noise and atmosphere generated by them really lifts him. Di Rocco is a good fighter but he'll be up against the crowd and an inspired Ricky Burns."
