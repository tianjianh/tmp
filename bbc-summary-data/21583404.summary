[SN]TITLE[SN]
New York Times to rename International Herald Tribune

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The International Herald Tribune is to be renamed the International New York Times after its parent newspaper.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The change, expected this autumn, will end the 40-year-old IHT brand familiar to US expatriate readers.
It follows other moves by the NY Times to consolidate its image, including plans to sell off the Boston Globe announced this month.
Chief executive Mark Thompson said the paper would add new reporters, and aim to expand its overseas readership.
Mr Thompson took over at the liberal-leaning NY Times last November, and was previously director general of the BBC.
The paper has wholly owned the IHT since 2003, when it bought out the 50% owned by its rival, the Washington Post.
The international journal has already undergone several previous name changes in its 125-year history.
The IHT already shares a common online platform with the NY Times, and about 10% of the business's 640,000 digital subscribers are located outside the US.
