The bowlers enjoyed the upper hand on the first day of the interprovincial three-day game between Northern Knights and North-West Warriors at Eglinton.

After a rain delay, Knights were put in to bat and made 130, James Shannon the only batsman to impress with two sixes and eight boundaries in a score of 71.
Craig Young took 5-37 and Stuart Thompson 3-32 for the Warriors.
By the close of play, the North-West had reached 89-4, 41 runs in arrears, with Andy McBrine undefeated on 29.
The hosts still have 35 overs to face when play resumes, weather permitting, on Wednesday morning.
Monday's scheduled inter-provincial 50-over game between the sides was abandoned because of rain.
