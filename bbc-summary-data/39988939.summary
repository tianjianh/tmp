[SN]TITLE[SN]
Sussex v Durham: Jofra Archer takes five wickets to help dismiss visitors for 287

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Jofra Archer took five wickets to help Sussex bowl Durham out for 287 and make a solid start on day one at Hove.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Put into bat, Durham slipped to 129-5 as Archer (5-76) and Vernon Philander (2-60) combined well with the new ball.
However, Ryan Pringle (60) and Paul Coughlin (73) survived dropped catches to put on 110 for the sixth wicket before Archer cleaned up the tail.
Sussex then lost Harry Finch to Graham Onions' first ball, but Luke Wells and Chris Nash reached stumps at 43-1.
It was 22-year-old Archer's day, which began when he bowled in-form England opener Keaton Jennings before Philander removed Cameron Steel and South Africa international Steven Cook for 45 to expose the middle order.
It could have been a smaller first-innings score for the visitors too, with Pringle and Coughlin both benefiting from some good fortune.
Pringle was dropped off Danny Briggs' bowling on 22 and Coughlin on 44 off David Wiese, while Sussex also thought they had Pringle for 51 only for Wiese's catch at fine leg to be given not out.
But Archer eventually had Coughlin caught by Briggs before completing his five-wicket haul by dismissing tail-enders Onions and Chris Rushworth.
