Former England Under-19 midfielder Tynan died in August aged 18.
After sealing top spot in WSL 2 on what would have been her 19th birthday, Everton wore number 19 'Tynan' shirts, bearing the message: "For you Zoe."
"Everyone who has been at Everton will always be part of Everton," manager Andy Spence told BBC Sport.
"The family know they've got the support of us as a football club and this is just a little thank you to the family and a message to say this was really for Zoe.
"Not many days pass where we don't think of her or her family and what they've been through. They know they've got the love and support of Everton Football Club."
Tynan, who also played for Manchester City and Fylde Ladies, spent six years at Everton's centre of excellence.
