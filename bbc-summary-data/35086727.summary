The Welshman, 40, started the day two shots behind overnight leader Clement Sordet but nine birdies and two bogeys sealed his first win of 2015.
Frenchman Sordet (70) and England's Lee Westwood (67) finished joint second.
Donaldson and Westwood's efforts mean they have returned to the world's top 50 to qualify for the 2016 Open and Masters.
Sordet also qualified for the Open, along with Thailand's Phachara Khongwatmai, who finished sixth.
The win for Donaldson was his first since claiming the Czech Masters in August last year.
Spain's Sergio Garcia shot a two-under 70 to finish fourth alongside South Korean An Byeong-hun.
