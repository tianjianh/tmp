[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Darren Jackson, 51, was serving a life sentence at HMP Sudbury, Derbyshire, but was reported missing on Tuesday.
He was arrested by Staffordshire Police on Thursday on suspicion of escaping from lawful custody.
Jackson killed Gill Ellis in Burnley in 1984, when he was a teenager, by stamping on her stomach and tearing a main blood vessel to her heart.
In 1997, he escaped from HMP Ranby, in Nottinghamshire, and went on the run for three days before giving himself up.
He was released in 2007 - after serving 21 years of his sentence - but was later recalled to Sudbury Prison.
