FC Sion 0-0 Liverpool

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Liverpool finished top of their Europa League group by drawing with FC Sion in an uneventful game in Switzerland.

The Reds' best openings fell to Divock Origi, but he miscued a volley in the first half and was later denied by a fine last-ditch tackle.
He almost rounded the keeper late on, forcing a save in one of few chances.
Simon Mignolet made one routine save to deny Ebenezer Assifuah as Liverpool maintained their unbeaten record in this season's competition.
A goalless draw with a side sixth in the Swiss Super League will hardly list among Liverpool's finer European nights, but the sight of club captain Jordan Henderson making his first start since August is an undoubted positive for manager Jurgen Klopp.
Philippe Coutinho appeared after 60 minutes after four games out with a hamstring complaint but not even his creativity could forge a meaningful opening as both sides struggled on a pitch which was partially frozen.
Origi - whose significance to Liverpool increased with news of another injury setback to Daniel Sturridge on Tuesday - was willing throughout but should have been more clinical.
As the 20-year-old broke through the home defence in the second period, his attempt to round Andris Vanins in the home goal lacked intent, and despite stretching he could not connect with an inviting cross late on.
The peripheral nature of summer signing Roberto Firmino was out of character given his recent impressive form, but Liverpool - who qualify with Sion - will welcome another solid display under Klopp, who now has tasted defeat just twice in 13 matches in charge.
"I am really satisfied, no-one is injured and they were very focused and concentrated on the game," said Klopp afterwards.
An impressive full debut for left-back Bradley Smith was also a plus-point.
He showcased pace and an attacking instinct throughout, crossing for Origi to misfire a volley early on and Liverpool's attacks - particularly in the first half - were through the 21-year-old.
Australian-born, Smith is now a full international for the Socceroos despite playing for England at under-17 and under-20 level.
His opportunity under Klopp marks a turnaround as, having spent seven years in the club's academy, he almost left when his contract expired in the summer, before signing a new deal last month.
The first leg of the last-32 ties is scheduled for 18 February, with the return seven days later. The Reds will face Everton and Manchester City within a week of the second leg, so an easier draw will likely keep Klopp happy.
Monday's draw could see them paired with any of the runners up in the Europa League's 11 other groups, sides including Villarreal, Marseille or Klopp's former employers Borussia Dortmund.
As group winners, they could potentially meet four of the sides who drop out of the Champions League with the worst record, including Sevilla and Gary Neville's Valencia.
Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp: "It was difficult. The ground was very difficult to play and for both teams the first thing to do was show you were prepared for a game like this and that is what my team did. "It was not our best football and although it is an outdoor sport frozen ground is for other sports.
"We wanted to be first after this game and that is what we did. A few weeks ago it was far away from us that we could reach this place but we did it and it is really good.
"Everyone will have to change their mind about this tournament now as everyone will see it is something like a small Champions League."
Liverpool - eighth in the Premier League - travel to West Bromwich Albion on Sunday, a side they are unbeaten against in their last four meetings.
