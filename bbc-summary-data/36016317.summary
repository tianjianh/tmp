County Championship: Keaton Jennings second century hands Durham control

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Keaton Jennings' second century of the match kept Durham on top on day two against Somerset at Chester-le-Street.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Somerset resumed day two on 30-3 but lost James Hildreth and Jim Allenby cheaply as they fell in successive balls to seamer Graham Onions.
Having been reduced to 85-7, Peter Trego then hit 45 to help them limp to 179 all out, a deficit of 77.
Jennings' ton came off 163 balls, including 15 fours, as Durham closed on 223-5, with a healthy lead of 300 runs.
The second morning belonged to former England bowler Onions, who made the breakthrough by having Hildreth caught at third slip by Ryan Pringle before Allenby missed a straight ball and fell lbw.

Roelof van der Merwe became the 33-year-old's fourth victim of the innings when he was caught behind, before a calamitous mix-up in the middle saw new Somerset captain Chris Rogers run out for 23 off the following ball.
Trego's rapid innings included five boundaries but pace bowler Brydon Carse claimed his maiden first-class wickets, including a catch return of wicketkeeper Ryan Davies, to mop up the away side's tail.
In the afternoon sun, the hosts then raced to 50 without loss off just seven overs, as Mark Stoneman hit a run-a-ball 41 before picking out Marcus Trescothick at short midwicket in Van Der Merwe's first over.
Jennings reached his century by dispatching Van der Merwe over the top to the boundary, becoming just the third Durham player (after Dean Jones and Paul Collingwood) to score tons in both innings of a first-class match.
