Ryan Duggan, 19, of Wavell Avenue, Widnes, shot 25-year-old Daniel Kennedy outside his home in the town in October last year.
Police said if Mr Kennedy had not been carrying a mobile phone in his pocket he would have "undoubtedly died".
Another man, Jordan Grimes, 23, of Alexander Drive, Widnes was jailed for two years for assisting an offender.
He allowed Duggan to stay at a flat in Burnley following the incident.
Chester Crown Court heard Mr Kennedy had returned to his flat at St Michael's View to find the water supply had been switched off by Duggan and a number of other youths.
When Mr Kennedy went out to speak to the group, an argument followed and he chased Duggan down a footpath before the teenager pulled out a firearm and shot him.
Mr Kennedy suffered serious injuries to the abdomen and was taken to Aintree hospital.
Police said his "devastating injuries" would affect him for the rest of his life.
Det Insp McIntyre, from Cheshire Constabulary, said: "Duggan's actions that night were extreme and shocking.
"Fortunately, the victim's mobile phone took the brunt of the shot and, as a result of this, he survived.  This is remarkable - had that phone not been in his pocket at that time he would undoubtedly have died."
Senior District Crown Prosecutor Richard Riley said:  "Ryan Duggan fired a shotgun at Mr Kennedy from 1.5 metres.  In my view this was a clear intent to kill, not just to injure.  The jury agreed with that and Duggan has now been given a substantial jail term."
