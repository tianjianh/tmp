Five men have been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after the incident in Burpham, just before 20:00 GMT on Thursday.
The victim, 21, was injured in Bowers Farm Drive by a white panel that was later found burnt out, police said.
He has serious head, arm and leg injuries but is in a stable condition.
A 25-year-old from Guildford arrested on suspicion of attempted murder, affray and criminal damage remains in police custody.
Three Guildford men, aged 29, 31, and 47, arrested on suspicion of attempted murder, affray and criminal damage have been released on bail until 13 June.
A 21-year-old man arrested on suspicion of attempted murder has been released with no further action taken.
The van was later found later on Thursday evening in Elstead, police said.
Officers have linked the assault to another altercation earlier that evening in Lawrence Close, Burpham.
Det Insp Nick Chambers said: "There were a number of different incidents in the Burpham area on Thursday evening involving the same groups of people - who are known to each other."
He said the incident happened in a very public place, adding: "There were people taking photos and video of the incident and I would ask anyone with footage to contact us as a matter of urgency.
"I am also very keen to hear from anyone who saw the white panel van being abandoned and set on fire in Elstead and where the occupants went following that."
