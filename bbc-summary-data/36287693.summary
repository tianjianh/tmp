A man who plied two teenagers with alcohol before subjecting them to "horrendous" sexual abuse has been jailed for 21 years.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Christopher Colebrook, 44, of Bowers Fold, Doncaster, pleaded guilty to repeatedly raping and assaulting a 16-year-old girl and 19-year-old man.
Police said they believed he may have attacked others and urged possible victims to come forward.
Colebook was jailed at Sheffield Crown Court.
Det Con Nichole Russell said: "He preyed on vulnerable teenagers, subjecting them to horrendous sexual offending after plying them with alcohol.
"This investigation revealed Colebrook's true predatory nature and we believe that there could be other victims of this man out there who are yet to come forward."
Colebrook pleaded guilty to four counts of rape, two counts of sexual assault and one count of assaulting a police officer.
