The UK Independence Party has suspended a parliamentary candidate over a slur sent to a Jewish Labour candidate from his Twitter account.

Jack Sen, who is standing in West Lancashire, sent the tweet to Liverpool Wavertree candidate Luciana Berger.
The post reads: "Protect child benefits? If you had it your way you'd send the Â£ to Poland/ Israel."
UKIP said the comments "in no way reflects the view of the party" or any of their other "dedicated candidates".
A spokesman said Mr Sen had been suspended with immediate effect "in light of these and other comments".
Earlier, Ms Berger had told the Jewish News: "This is clearly an anti-Semitic comment. Remarks like these have no place in our politics. I expect UKIP to take action."
Mr Sen's name will still appear on ballot papers for the constituency.
