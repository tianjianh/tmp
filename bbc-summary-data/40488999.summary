Derbyshire, resuming on 332-9, were bowled out for 368 as Billy Godleman (98) and Gurjit Sandhu (46 not out) took their 10th-wicket stand to 102.
Led by Michael Richardson's 121-ball 64, Durham eased to 119-1 in reply.
After slipping to 137-5, Paul Coughlin (62 not out) led the recovery, but Tahir took two wickets in two balls as Durham closed 94 behind on 274-8.
Barry McCarthy (32 not out) has so far put on 69 with Coughlin for the ninth wicket - a partnership which helped Durham avoid the follow-on.
