The 28-year-old captained Salford last season as they won the Million Pound Game to stay in the top flight.
Lee, who can also play at half-back or at loose forward, has also played for Hull FC and Wakefield and Huddersfield.
"His leadership and composure will be vital in our young squad as we look to challenge for honours this season," said Saints coach Keiron Cunningham.
