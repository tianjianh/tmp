England and Wales have accused each other of illegal scrummaging before the Six Nations showdown at Twickenham.
The hosts' head coach Eddie Jones believes Wales push too early at the scrum but Adam Jones says Wales' set-piece could help them dominate.
"Any prop worth his salt pushes the boundaries as much as they can at this level," Adam Jones told BBC Wales.
"The more they can get Samson to pre-engage, I think the better for them.
"For me he's one of the best tight heads in the world.
"If Samson can get to grips with Joe [Marler] then Wales will be fine."

Eddie Jones says his side have a stronger scrum than Wales, adding if the laws are enforced England "will get an advantage".
Wales felt harshly done-by at the scrum in their 28-25 win over England in the pool stage of last year's World Cup.
Forwards coach Robin McBryde highlighted England prop Joe Marler as a frequent infringer at the scrum.
Marler's Harlequins front row colleague Adam Jones believes accusations the 25-year-old is guilty of illegal tactics at the scrum have been harsh.
"For me he's a square scrummager and he gets quite a bad reputation, especially after the World Cup," Jones added.
"When the scrummaging went to the new laws without the hits, he was one of the props you thought it would favour more because he get a long bind and he's outside the tight-head.
"In the World Cup he scrummaged well against Wales and he got the penalties, and against Australia it was the reverse."
