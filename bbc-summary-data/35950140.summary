No team has won the competition more than once since its inception in 2007.
India, Pakistan, England, West Indies and Sri Lanka have all won the title.
England lost to West Indies in their first group match but have since won four in a row, while the Windies lost to Afghanistan having qualified for the semi-finals, where they beat India.
Australia face West Indies in the women's final.
England's Eoin Morgan: "We know it's not going to be a normal game. Even in the semi-final, there was quite a lot of hype around the expectation of playing in a final.
"I want all of our players to embrace it. Everything's going to feel a little bit rushed to start with. It's important that we're in a really good frame of mind to slow things down when needed and more importantly execute our skills.
"Given the strides we have made in the last 12 months in white-ball cricket, I think this would be a great reward for the mindset we've shown, the dedication and the hard work we've put in."

West Indies skipper Darren Sammy: "England is a team we respect. We know the calibre of players they have in the dressing room - they have a lot of match-winners as well.
"But we tend to focus on what we can do on the cricket field and as a group we believe that once we do what we know we can it is going to be difficult to defeat us.
"Since that loss to us, England have moved in leaps and bounds - that's why they are in the final. I always want cricket to be the winner and hope the fans are entertained and it will be a very exciting match, but at the end I just want West Indies to be victorious."

Eden Gardens has been staging international cricket since 1934 and hosted its first T20 international in 2011.
The highest score made there in a T20 was the 201-5 Pakistan posted against Bangladesh in this event. Bangladesh hold the unwanted lowest-score record, with their 70 against New Zealand last month.
Neither finalist has yet played at the ground in this tournament, England playing all their games to date in Mumbai and Delhi, West Indies playing at Mumbai, Bangalore and Nagpur.
Temperatures are expected to be around 31C for the final, which is a night game, beginning at 19:00 local time, with a capacity crowd of 66,000 expected.
BBC Weather's Alex Deakin has prepared a special forecast, which you can see here.
BBC cricket correspondent Jonathan Agnew:
"England have managed to peak at just the right time - their bruising defeat by the West Indies in their opening match seems years ago.
"They've won and won well from difficult positions all the way, gaining the confidence that retains calmness under pressure.
"Root, Buttler, Stokes and Roy have all enhanced their credentials, while Jordan's bowling at the end has improved dramatically.
"West Indies have proved they are far more than a one-man, Chris Gayle show and their confidence and enthusiasm is sky-high.
"If both teams play to their potential, it should be quite a final."
