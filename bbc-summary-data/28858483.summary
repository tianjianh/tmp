[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 44-year-old from Cumbria, who was working on the pier, was pronounced dead at the scene after falling on to the beach just before 16:00 BST.
The Health and Safety Executive has been informed as the man, who suffered head injuries, was working at the time.
The fire on 30 July destroyed about a third of the 144-year-old, Grade II-listed pier.
Earlier Sussex Police had said the man had received serious head injuries in the fall and been flown to hospital.
His next of kin have been informed.
At the height of the fire, up to 80 firefighters, together with RNLI crews, tackled the blaze, which police say may have been started deliberately.
It broke out behind some wood panelling in the arcade building, sending huge plumes of smoke into the air.
The owners of the pier have said the structure could be partially open by Christmas.
David Cameron has pledged Â£2m to help support businesses and traders suffering in the wake of the fire.
