Hial airport security staff set to strike

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Security staff at Scotland's regional airports are due to take part in a 48-hour strike over pay and conditions.

The Prospect union and Highlands and Islands Airport (Hial) have been holding talks in the hope of resolving the dispute.
The strike, affecting 11 airports, is set to start at midday.
Hial said all of its airports would operate as normal, as would all scheduled services apart from the Dundee-Stansted service.
A spokesman said scheduled passengers intending to fly were advised to arrive 15-20 minutes earlier for their flight and limit the amount of hand or check-in luggage they take to the airport.
Scottish government-owned Hial also said it would be helpful if passengers could limit the amount of liquids they check in to help speed up the security process.
Passengers should confirm the status of their flight with their airline before leaving for the airport.
All Dundee passengers with flights booked from Tuesday afternoon to Thursday morning should contact the Loganair passenger contact centre on 01496 302 022 to rebook their flights.
General Aviation traffic will operate as usual at all 11 airports, which include those in the Hebrides, Orkney and Shetland, Argyll, Inverness and Wick.
Hial managing director Inglis Lyon said: "Whilst we are disappointed that the industrial action is taking place, we have been working hard to develop contingencies to enable the airports to remain open and minimise the amount of disruption for our passengers.
"We would like to thank passengers, in advance, for their co-operation and understanding during this period, and we would also like to thank the local teams for their support and helping it be business as usual."
On Friday Prospect negotiator Alan Denney said: "Despite attempts to find a settlement to the dispute in AMSL, the inability of the company or the Scottish government to find a way to settle this matter means that industrial action is inevitable."
The dispute involves staff working in Hial's security company AMSL.
Prospect has sought a basic pay increase of 5%, equalisation with Hial's terms and conditions and parity with higher-paid staff at Sumburgh Airport on Shetland.
Hial said the islands have a higher cost of living, low rates of unemployment "and a buoyant oil-based economy has traditionally attracted higher wages".
The company said collectively the package of measures would amount to an increase of almost 30%.
In an earlier statement, Hial said even a rise of 5% was "wildly unrealistic".
