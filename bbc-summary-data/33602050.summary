A woman from Cardiff who has incurable breast cancer has made a documentary to "challenge" the image of living with a terminal illness.

Rowena Kincaid, 39, discovered what she described as "a baked potato sized tumour" in her chest almost two years ago.
She was told, with treatment, she had up to two years to live.
In the documentary Before I Kick the Bucket the BBC Wales picture editor meets others with a terminal diagnosis.
She said filming the documentary was "a hell of a journey" but also "laugh-out-loud funny".
In the programme she visits a funeral parlour dressed as Wonder Woman and streaks down a Cardiff street.
Ms Kincaid said: "I want this film to raise awareness about the diversity of terminal diseases and about how people live with them day-to-day.
"You pass people in the street and would never know anything was wrong. But behind the surface there's hardship and heartache and laughter and life. And that, ultimately, is what I want to show the world."
