Emergency services were called just before 07:30 to an empty detached bungalow that was being renovated in Forthview Road.
Firefighters were still at the scene four hours later, and a cordon was in place. The fire, which was in the roof, has been put out.
A Scottish Fire and Rescue Service spokeswoman said there was "extensive damage to the property".
