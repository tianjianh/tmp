An "ultimate" 10-mile endurance race due to take place on Saturday has been postponed because of a predicted "deterioration in the weather".

The PARAS'10 race in Colchester is run by soldiers and civilians, some of whom carry 35lbs (16kg) packs.
High heat and humidity had been forecast, meaning "medical risk to the safety of runners was too high".
"A hard call had to be made in light of weather," tweeted organisers from the charity Support Our Paras.
"There are real dangers of heat exhaustion even for highly fit soldiers and since two-thirds of the PARAS'10 field are tabbing with 35lbs, this carries genuine risk for all.
"A serious casualty would be the end of the event," the charity wrote in a statement.
The event, which organisers say is regarded as "the ultimate 10 mile endurance race," has been rescheduled to take place on 15 November.
