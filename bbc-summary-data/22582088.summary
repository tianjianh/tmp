The 27-year-old, who won heptathlon gold at London 2012, tied the knot with Andy Hill in the village of Hathersage.
Having returned to training following her triumph at London 2012, the Sheffield athlete chose to miss the 2013 indoor season to concentrate on this summer's World Championships.
Her outdoor season is due to start on 8 June at Edinburgh's Meadowbank Stadium.
She will then join fellow British gold medallists Greg Rutherford and Mo Farah at the London 2012 Anniversary Games, held at the Olympic Stadium, from 26-28 July.
Ennis will compete in the 100m hurdles and long jump.
She met Hill at school and the couple have been together for about eight years. He proposed to her on Christmas Eve in 2011.
In an interview last December, the 27-year-old said she was enjoying planning her "medium-sized" wedding and was "loving all the girlie stuff".
