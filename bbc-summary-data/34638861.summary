[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Graveney, who was a lower order batsmen and right-arm swing bowler, passed away at his home in Texas on Sunday.
In 1949 he took 59 wickets, including 10-66 against Derbyshire, the second-best innings analysis in the county's history before retiring in 1964.
"Everyone at the club extends their sincere condolences to the Graveney Family," said a club statement.
After his retirement, Graveney remained active behind the scenes at the club, serving as chairman of the general committee.
His brother Tom and his son David both had long cricket careers with Gloucestershire, and also both captained the county.
