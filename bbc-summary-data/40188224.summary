British and Irish Lions coach Warren Gatland is confident Wales fly-half Dan Biggar will make a quick recovery after he failed a head injury assessment.

He was forced off the field towards the end of the first half of the Lions' 22-16 loss to the Blues in the second game of their New Zealand tour.
"The medics think he'll be fine during the week and should be OK," said Gatland.
Centre Jared Payne also left the field with a "tight calf" in the second half.
Payne was a late withdrawal from the Lions' opening win over a Provincial Union XV on Saturday because of a calf injury.
"Jared's had that calf (problem) for a while, so the pleasing thing is he's got through 50 to 60 minutes," said the Lions coach.
Biggar's Wales and Ospreys half-back partner Rhys Webb came off in the second half, with the scrum-half suffering with cramp.
The fly-half was making his first appearance for the Lions, who face Crusaders in Christchurch in the third of their 10-game tour on Saturday.
He missed Ospreys' Pro12 game against Cardiff Blues in April because of concussion suffered in the defeat by Leinster.
Gatland said the Lions medical staff were aware of Payne's calf issue before the game.
