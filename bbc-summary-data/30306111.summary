[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Mark Everard, 48, was found dead outside a house in Chell Heath, Stoke-on-Trent, in May.
Steven Mutch, 45, had previously denied murder, but pleaded guilty on Tuesday at the start of the trial at Stafford Crown Court. He was sentenced to life.
A post-mortem examination revealed Mr Everard died as a result of abdominal injuries.
Mutch had called 999 saying Mr Everard was unconscious after a fall, Staffordshire Police said.
However, paramedics were made suspicious by Mutch's behaviour and signs of blood in their flat on Bishop Road.
The pair had been in a relationship for five years.
Det Ch Insp Darren Harding, who led the investigation, said his thoughts were with the victim's family and hoped the sentence would offer them "some form of closure".
