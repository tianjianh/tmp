World champion Mark Selby has won his first title of the season with victory in the Paul Hunter Classic in Germany.

The world number one beat fellow Englishman Tom Ford 4-2 to win the event for the third time.
The win was Selby's first since claiming his second world title in May, having not progressed beyond the last 32 in two events so far this season.
"It's always great to win a tournament and I can take a lot of confidence from it," the 33-year-old said.
"It wasn't a good final - Tom missed a few balls. But it's always a great tournament here in Germany with fantastic crowds."
Former Masters and UK Championship winner Jimmy White lost in the quarter-finals of the event, while Thailand's Thepchaiya Un-Nooh hit the first 147 break of his career on Saturday.
