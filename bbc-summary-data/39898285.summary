The New Zealand-born 26-year-old arrived in Wales in 2014 and has scored 337 points for the region.
Anscombe, who was named in Wales' summer tour squad earlier this week, has played for Wales nine times.
"It is great to see Gareth re-signing his dual contract and becoming another player to commit his future to the game in Wales," said coach Warren Gatland.
"Gareth has recovered well from recent injuries to hit form once again and is deserving of his place in Wales' upcoming summer tour."
Anscombe says he is pleased to be staying somewhere he now considers "home".
"It's pleasing to recommit to Wales and Cardiff Blues, who are a region I very much want to be a part of," Anscombe commented.
"I'm looking forward to the summer tour, but I'm only at the start of my international career and hopefully I can contribute a lot more in the years to come.
"There's a lot more to do before that and it's very important for me that Cardiff Blues finish the season well and next year push into to the top six and play at a consistent high level.
"Wales feels like home now, the boys have been a big part of that and my partner and I feel really settled here in Cardiff."
Blues go to Stade Francais in a semi-final play-off on Friday, 19 May for the last remaining place in the European Champions Cup.
If successful, Anscombe will then link up with Wales for the summer Test matches against Tonga and Samoa in June after the play-off final on Friday, 26 May.
Blues head coach Danny Wilson added: "It's great news that Gareth has recommitted his future to Cardiff Blues and Wales.
"Since he has returned from injury he has got better every week and proven his quality.
"He is a key figure for us and is not just a good professional, but also an important leader within the squad.
"Gareth has a big future with Cardiff Blues and he has all the quality and potential to kick on with Wales."
