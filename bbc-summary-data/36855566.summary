Hungarian GP: Drivers face return-to-pit instruction under new radio rules

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Restrictions on radio communication between teams and drivers have been strengthened in the build-up to Sunday's Hungarian Grand Prix.

Any message informing a driver of a car problem "must include an irreversible instruction to return to the pits to rectify the problem or to retire".
The ruling from governing body the FIA comes after Mercedes broke radio rules at Silverstone last time out.
Nico Rosberg was demoted from second to third after a 10-second penalty.
The new ruling means teams will not be able to make calculations about the potential time loss of any post-race penalty in giving instructions to a driver.
Instead, the requirement for a driver to return to the pits to rectify a problem he does not know how to solve himself will automatically result in losing a significant amount of time.
The new FIA ruling also stresses that any change a team tells a driver to make must be with the aim of repairing a problem and not improving performance.
A note issued to the teams says any instruction "must be for the sole purpose of mitigating loss of function of a sensor, actuator or controller whose degradation or failure was not detected and handled by the onboard software".
It adds: "It will be the responsibility of any team giving any such instruction to satisfy the FIA technical delegate that this was the case and that any new setting chosen in this way did not enhance the performance of the car beyond that prior to the loss of function."
Teams have said that the radio rules need to be re-thought as it is wrong to penalise a driver for fixing a serious problem on his car.
But the FIA is concerned that the cars are too complicated, and do not need to have such complex control systems.
Part of the intention of the radio ban was to force teams to simplify the cars, but this has not happened.
