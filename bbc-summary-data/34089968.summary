Phone-hacking case: CPS considers corporate prosecution

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Prosecutors are considering a file for a possible corporate prosecution over phone hacking at the News of the World.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Met Police said detectives from Operation Weeting handed a file on "corporate liability charges" to the Crown Prosecution Service on 23 July.
The CPS said it had received a "full file of evidence for consideration".
The BBC's Daniel Sandford said it did not mean charges would be brought against News UK but it showed they were still being "actively considered".
News UK, formerly News International, was the owner of the NoW, which closed in the wake of the phone-hacking scandal in July 2011.
The company, which also owns the Times and the Sun, changed its name in 2013.
Royals, celebrities and victims of crime were among those whose phones were hacked by the Sunday newspaper.
Operation Weeting is the Metropolitan Police's investigation into phone hacking at the NoW.
