Briggs, 25, featured in Saturday's 1-1 draw against Blackpool - his first appearance of the season.
He was sidelined with a hip injury and also unavailable for family reasons, as his son was born prematurely.
"I had a hard time with the birth of my son and then getting this injury. It's a hard thing to go through and I wouldn't wish it on anybody," he said.
"It's good to be back. It's been a difficult time."
Briggs, who started his career at Fulham, had an operation in August and required follow-up treatment.
"It's been a tough rollercoaster for me, but I worked hard and had the support of my family and I'm happy I'm back," Briggs told BBC Essex.
"My operation was successful but I had a few ongoing problems with my back and had to have a few injections. After that the rehabilitation went well."
