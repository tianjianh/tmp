Newport County boss Graham Westley says the club are in "desperate need" of some new defenders to turn their poor form around.

The Exiles are five points adrift at the bottom of League Two and have lost their last seven league matches.
Monday's 2-1 defeat by Wycombe Wanderers meant they have conceded 12 goals in their last four league games.
"We've has a run of results that I can't ever remember having as a manager," Westley told BBC Radio Wales.
"It's never as easy as you think or as fans hope to bring new lads through the door. I've said we are in desperate need of some defenders at the club."
With Joss Labadie sidelined with a knee injury, Westley has been forced to be creative with his team selection during the busy festive period.
"I've got Jennison [Myrie-Williams] playing at left back who is not a natural defender and Jazzi [Barnum-Bobb] who is an attacking full back but he's not a defensive one," he continued.
"We've got a pairing at centre-half that isn't an ideal pairing right now with the captain [Scot Bennett] being out."
Rhys Healey played his final game for the Exiles in the defeat by the Chairboys before returning to Cardiff City as his loan spell had ended.
"He will have learned a lot, he had a phase where things were going well for him. He got a bit of interest and there was a bit of a rumour going round that others were interested and I think he lost his way," Westley said.
"That's a lesson for him. Hopefully it'll happen to him again in his career where things are going in the right direction. You've got to respect your team at that time."
