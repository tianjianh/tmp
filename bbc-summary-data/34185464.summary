Modou Barrow: Swansea end winger's loan spell at Blackburn

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Swansea City have recalled Modou Barrow from his loan at Blackburn Rovers.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Premier League side have decided they need Barrow back in the squad to fill the void left by Nathan Dyer's loan move to Leicester City.
Gambia international Barrow, 22, made five appearances for Championship side Blackburn after joining on a three-month loan in August.
He won his second cap for Gambia in Sunday's African Cup of Nations 1-0 defeat by Cameroon.
A loan spell at Nottingham Forest was also cut short last season after injuries to Wayne Routledge and Jefferson Montero.
