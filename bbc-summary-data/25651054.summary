Nottingham-Kimberley tram extension should go ahead, says government

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Nottingham tram system should be extended to Kimberley, a government planning inspector has said.

A line to the town has been suggested in the past but campaigners have said the latest comments are a boost.
The inspector made the reccommendation in a report allowing an appeal for 116 homes on the potential route through Nuthall.
Broxtowe Borough Council rejected the application because it found insufficient provision for a new line.
Planning inspector Mrs K Ellison wrote in the report: "I consider that the potential extension to Kimberley should be regarded as both desirable and enjoying reasonable prospects of being brought forward."
She added that there was enough room for a tram to travel along residential streets in the development, known as Hempshill Hall.
The Kimberley Eastwood and Nuthall Tram Action Group, has been campaigning for an extension from Phoenix Park since 2009.
Chairman Andy Cooper said: "It's definitely a boost to the campaign.
"But there are quite a few areas in Nottingham hoping for the next phase of the tram."
The group is hoping to fund a feasibility study into the route this year.
"This area is crying out for regeneration - it's a neglected area," said Mr Cooper.
"Not only that it would cut down on traffic congestion - the Nuthall island on the A610 is a nightmare."
Chris Deas, Nottingham Express Transit project director told the Nottingham Post: "We are pleased that the planning inspector recognises the need to safeguard the potential tram route towards Kimberley."
But not everyone in the town supports the possible extension.
Roy Plumb, who owns a hardware store, said it was more likely to take shoppers out to Nottingham.
"Apart from improving the traffic situation, I can't see any benefits for the town," he said.
A Â£500m tram extension to Chilwell and Clifton is set to be completed by the end of this year.
Suggested future extension routes in the past have included to Toton, Ilkeston, Long Eaton and Gedling.
