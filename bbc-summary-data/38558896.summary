US President-elect Donald Trump's response to Meryl Streep's attack on him has triggered a firestorm of tweets defending and excoriating the actress.

Mr Trump dismissed Streep as overrated after she took aim at him during a speech at Sunday's Golden Globes.
The Oscar-winning actress received an outpour of praise when she condemned Mr Trump for mocking a disabled reporter.
But some Twitter users were quick to defend Mr Trump, attacking Streep and Hollywood for being out of touch.
Numerous celebrities and Streep supporters took to Twitter to defend the award-winning actress' remarks.
Meghan McCain, daughter of Republican Senator John McCain and a Fox news personality, who was a vocal critic of Mr Trump during the presidential campaign, was among the first to criticise Streep's comments.
Other Twitter users weighed in, claiming that Mr Trump did not mock New York Times reporter Serge Kovaleski, who suffers from a congenital disorder, at a South Carolina rally in 2015.
Mr Trump's senior aide Kellyanne Conway also came to the president-elect's defence on Monday, accusing Streep of "inciting people's worst instincts".
She also denied that Mr Trump made fun of Mr Kovaleski and instead asked why Streep's "passion for the disabled" did not include a "shout out" to the mentally disabled man in Chicago who was tortured on Facebook Live by four black assailants.
"She sounds like 2014. The election is over. She lost," Ms Conway said on Fox News's Fox & Friends.
"Everybody in that audience, with very few exceptions, was of a single, myopic mind as to how they wanted the election to go and how they expected the election to go," she continued.
"They lost and I really wish she would have stood up last night and said, 'look, I didn't like the election results, but he's our president and we're going to support him.'"
Some Twitter users anticipated Mr Trump's response after the speech, offering what they expected the president-elect to tweet following Streep's remarks.
