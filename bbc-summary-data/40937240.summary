Sussex Police appealed for help in finding Robert Roche, 36, from Hove, after he failed to arrive at nursery with his three-year-old son and 18-month-old daughter on Monday morning.
Officers said they received a call from a member of the public earlier on Tuesday and found them in London Road.
Police are working to establish the circumstances of their disappearance.
