The makers of Grand Theft Auto 5 have confirmed the game will be getting a first-person perspective mode when it's released later this month.

"We could've put it in the [last-gen version] but we were too busy making the game," said Rob Nelson, Rockstar Games' animation director, in an interview with IGN.
"It's a very intense, in-your-face experienceâ€¦ literally."
GTA 5 arrives on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One on 18 November.
Nelson said he wanted gamers to experience the world from a different perspective.
"You're eye-level, down with the people on the street, and as you walk past them, you see them sort of look at you out of the corner of their eye. All of this stuff existed in the game before - lots of little details."
It's something the team says it had tried to achieve before, but wasn't able to on the older generation of consoles.
"We were constantly fighting about what we could have and what we could still push in, and what other areas you could steal memory back from - audio, art, maps - for animation.
"We weren't sure the world would have held up the way we would've wanted it to."
But changing the game in to a first-person perspective required a lot of work, with Rockstar saying it had to adapt GTA 5 extensively.
"You have to change pretty much everything," said Nelson.
"I mean, if you want to do it right. We have a very solid third-person animation system, but you don't just put the camera down there and expect to see the guns, aim, and shoot.
"All those animations are new when you switch to first-person, because it all has to be animated to the camera, to make it feel like a proper first-person experience that I think people would expect. All the timings have to be re-evaluated."
