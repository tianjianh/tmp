The six year olds were "touched inappropriately" at a playground in the Windsor theme park on 11 August.
Thames Valley Police said it had received more than 80 calls after a BBC One Crimewatch appeal on Monday.
One member of the public spotted a man matching the description of the offender in a photo, the force added.
A reconstruction of the assault was broadcast on Monday night, followed by a police appeal.
A spokesman for Thames Valley Police said the appeal had led to "a number of names" being put forward.
The force has issued an e-fit image of a man they would like to speak to in connection with the investigation.
The assaults happened between 12:15 and 12:30 BST in the Pirate Shores area of the attraction on a day when about 14,200 attended the theme park.
A man in his 20s, from Bracknell, was later arrested on suspicion of sexual assault but released without charge on 31 August.
