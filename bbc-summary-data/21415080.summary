Under the first deal with Taqa, Proserv will build a control system for three subsea wells near the Tern platform in the Cladhan field.
The other contract with an unnamed established operator involves subsea well and manifold control systems.
Proserv said the deals strengthened its position in the subsea controls and communications field.
Proserv chief executive David Lamont said: "Both contract wins reflect Proserv's industry-leading position and strong track record for delivering high-value integrated technology systems on time and within budget.
"Proserv's fast-growing suite of technologies have been developed based on the company's 'ingeniously simple' philosophy and are underpinned by the company's international talent pool of technical and engineering expertise which has expanded considerably through organic growth and strategic acquisition."
Westhill-based Proserv specialises in exploration and production, drilling and infrastructure technical solutions and services to the energy industry.
The company operates worldwide from 30 sites in six geographical regions.
