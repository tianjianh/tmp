[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A woman who was denied a UK visa, preventing her from living with her seriously ill husband, says the prime minister has told her to "try again".

David and Maria Summers, who have been married for 45 years, moved to Hereford from Canada to look after his mother.
The couple say immigration officials said they lacked finances and Mrs Summers was sent back to Canada.
Jesse Norman, MP for Hereford and South Herefordshire, raised the case with David Cameron.

British national Mr Summers, 70, has travelled to Canada to spend Christmas with his wife. He has undergone surgery for bladder cancer but before he left for his trip, a scan revealed another mass.
At Prime Minister's Questions on 18 November, Mr Norman said: "May I draw [the prime minister's] attention to the plight of David and Maria Summers, in my constituency, who have struggled to obtain permanent residency for Maria despite having been married for 45 years?
"May I ask the prime minister to encourage officials to look at the case again?"
Mr Cameron said: "I shall be happy to look at the case again."
Mrs Summers said she had received a copy of a letter sent to Mr Norman from the prime minister which said she should apply again.
"It says to give all relevant information and go from there. So that is what I will do," she said.
Mrs Summers said she was first refused a UK visa because immigration officials believed the couple were not in an "affectionate relationship" - a decision overturned by a tribunal.
A visa was then refused on the grounds that their joint income was insufficient, which the couple dispute.
She said: "David came to Canada on November 16. He will be going back to England in January, while I continue my fight for a visa.
"At least this Christmas we will be together."
The Home Office said it did not comment on individual cases.
