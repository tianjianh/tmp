The 47-year-old died after falling from a window at the Central Hotel, near Central Station, on Gordon Street.
The incident happened after officers attended the hotel, at 11:30 last Friday, as part of an ongoing inquiry.
The Police Investigations and Review Commissioner (Pirc) is examining the circumstances surrounding the fatality.
An initial appeal was issued on Monday for anyone who may have witnessed the incident to come forward.
Now a spokesman for the investigation team has asked anyone with video footage to contact them.
"We would like to thank the public for the overwhelming response so far to our initial appeal, which has provided us with important information to assist with our inquiries," he said.
"However, we are aware of the existence of crucial footage taken from mobile devices around the time of the incident and would urge anyone with this to come forward.
"We are keen to speak to any witnesses who were in Gordon Street, near to the entrance of Glasgow Central Station, between 11.15 am and 11.30 am on Friday 11 November 2016 who may be in possession of such footage."
Anyone in possession of video footage of the incident is asked to contact should contact the Pirc.
