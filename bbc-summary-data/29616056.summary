Every year a town in Maine, in America, competes in a boat race with a difference as part of the town's annual pumpkin celebrations leading up to Halloween.
Competitors carve giant boats out of pumpkins and race them down a river in order to win the "coveted"  Golden Gourd trophy.
They are judged on their pumpkin carving ability, and their paddling speed.
