Former Italy striker Fabrizio Ravanelli has applied to be Hearts' new head coach, but interim boss Jon Daly thinks he is ready for the job permanently.

Ravanelli, who had a short playing spell in Scotland with Dundee, was in charge of Ajaccio for five months when they were in Ligue 1 in 2013.
He has since been a television pundit back in his homeland.
When asked if he thought he was ready for the job, Daly replied. "I don't see why not. I feel ready to do it."
The Edinburgh club placed Daly in interim charge following Ian Cathro's sacking as head coach on Tuesday.
Daly's interim team comprises assistant head coach Austin MacPhee and first-team coach Liam Fox.
They will take charge of the first team for their opening game of the Scottish Premiership season on Saturday with a trip to Celtic.
"I will enjoy the experience for however long it lasts and we will take it from there," said Daly, who had been in charge of the club's under-20s squad.
"It's an opportunity for me to get some experience again at first-team level.
"I did it last year up at Ross County and I really enjoyed the experience. I really enjoy working for the club, whether that's at Under-20s level or a first-team level.
"It's a fantastic club; fantastic fan base, with fantastic players and backroom staff."
Daly would not be drawn on the reasons for Cathro's departure and insists focus remains on the opening game of the league campaign at Celtic Park.
"I can't really focus on what went wrong," Daly said. "I just need to focus on working with the boys.
"We obviously know it's not been a good place. The team are not in a good place mentally at the minute.
"It's trying to get the good vibes back and getting the players back working hard again.
"You are obviously planning for the start of the season with the Under 20s; then the manager leaves and you are into the limelight with the first team.
"It's something that I'm really looking forward to and working closely with Foxy and Austin and the rest of the backroom staff. I'm really looking forward to it and relishing the challenge."
Daly believes the model of having a director of football in the form of Craig Levein should not be a barrier in attracting a new head coach.
"I don't see why it would. It's obviously not a structure that a lot of Scottish clubs adopt.
"So, it's a bit alien to everyone. I knew nothing about it before I came in myself. The director of football is there to help and support the football staff and the coaching staff."
