Cardoza floored Conlan in the eighth round but the Belfast man recovered to earn a 19th straight professional win.
Conlan won the vacant WBC Silver Super-Flyweight title on a split decision.
Twice Olympic bronze medallist Paddy Barnes made it two wins from two pro fights with a comfortable points victory over Adrian Dimas Garzon.
The Belfast flyweight's opening bout ended in farcical fashion when opponent Stefan Slavchev was disqualified for lifting him off his feet.
This was a more straightforward win as a dominant Barnes put in a typically busy display to cruise to a 60-54 success against the Argentinian.
Conlan started brightly against Nicaraguan and former world title challenger Cardoza, but it developed into a close tussle.
Cardoza put his opponent on the canvas and finished strongly but the judges awarded the fight to Conlan on a 114-113, 115-113, 112-115 scorecard.
"He caught me high on the head, I had to ride the storm," Conlan told Box Nation.
"I could do this all week, although I don't want to do it all week. The crowd was brilliant."
The bill also included wins for Tyrone McKenna, Steven Ward, Con Sheehan, Phil Sutcliffe jnr, Marco McCullough and James Tennyson.
