Flanker Josh Turnbull says Wales' standard of play was simply not good enough in their heavy defeat against the Chiefs.

Wales, showing 14 changes from the 39-21 first Test defeat by New Zealand, were beaten 40-7.
Cardiff Blues back row Turnbull said Wales could not afford to make the same mistakes against the All Blacks.
"We'll have to look at our game because the standard of the Welsh jersey wasn't good enough," he said.
"We'll all have to look at that and take responsibility for it because it wasn't good enough."
Head coach Warren Gatland will name his team for the Saturday's second Test in Wellington on Wednesday.
Gatland said fringe players missed a chance to push their selection claims against the Chiefs.
Scrum-half Gareth Davies said Wales have "no excuses" following the defeat in Hamilton and they now have to focus on preparations for Saturday's game.
"No-one's played well enough to put their hands up to start at the weekend," Scarlets' Davies said.
"We've been with each other day in, day out training so we can't really blame that.
"We've got to take a good look at ourselves in the review and we've got a big day's training on Thursday.
"We've got to look forward to that now."
