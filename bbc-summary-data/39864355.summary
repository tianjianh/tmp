Tries for Joel Tomkins, Liam Farrell, Burgess and Liam Marshall gave the visitors an 18-0 half-time lead.
Swinton, who beat Huddersfield in the fifth round, responded after the break through Grant Gore's try.
Burgess ran in his second, while Tom Davies, Josh Ganson and Nick Gregson also went over for Wigan, before Mike Butt grabbed a late consolation.
Swinton already had one Super League scalp in the competition following their 28-24 victory at Huddersfield in the previous round, but they never looked likely of repeating the feat as Wigan scored three tries in the opening 24 minutes.
Tomkins went over from 30 metres, Farrell broke up a Swinton attack on halfway to run-in and score, while Burgess chased down his own grubber kick.
Ganson's superb pass sent Marshall in at the corner as Wigan scored four tries without reply by the break.
The Championship side got on the board when Gore went over from first-receiver, before Burgess got his second for Warriors when he chased down a Farrell toe-poke through.
Wigan then scored three tries in 15 minutes to wrap the game up as Davies raced clear from 40 metres, Ganson grabbed his first Warriors try and Gregson barged over from close range.
Butt pounced on a loose ball for Swinton's second try with five minutes remaining, but Wigan were well clear and kept alive their hopes of a third Challenge Cup success in seven years.
Swinton coach John Duffy:
"We were just a bit inconsistent in that first half. They are not world champions for nothing, even their younger lads who came in were superb.
"We have had a good dig into them and hopefully we can take what we have done with the good parts of our game into our league campaign now.
"I thought Jack Murphy was outstanding for us at the back and our wingers were superb. They'll have a few days off now because that will have taken a lot out of them."
Wigan coach Shaun Wane:
"I'm very happy with that. It was a bit disruptive with losing George (Williams) in the build-up.
"It's a job done - we wanted to be in the next round and we did that. We did some good things - our defence was good and they threw a lot at us.
"It's been a good day. If you look at the age of the team it's a very young team, we have got two back-rowers in the halves so our attack was not going to be great. We just found a way to win."
