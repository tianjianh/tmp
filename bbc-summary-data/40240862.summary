Josh Taylor will be Scotland's best since Ken Buchanan, says Carl Frampton

Former two-weight world champion Carl Frampton insists stablemate Josh Taylor will go on to become Scotland's finest boxer since Ken Buchanan.

Frampton and Taylor are both trained by Shane McGuigan and are under the guidance of promoter Barry McGuigan.
And having spent time sparring with Taylor, Frampton is in no doubt about his potential.
"This kid is going to be the best fighter to come out of Scotland since Ken Buchanan," the 30-year-old said.
Buchanan was the undisputed lightweight champion of the world in 1971 and Frampton is well-placed to make such a comparison with Taylor.
"I honestly think that and I don't want to be putting pressure on Josh, but I've seen what he can do day in, day out," the Northern Irishman told BBC Scotland.
"He has it all. He's tall and skinny and people look at him and think he's not a puncher, but his record suggests otherwise. He's been knocking these guys over.
"I've been in the ring sparring with him and he's a terrific puncher. His shot selection is brilliant, better than mine, he has great distance control, he can take a good shot and he can box ahead of people."
Northern Ireland's Frampton has a global reputation, having held the IBF and WBA super-bantamweight belts as well as the WBA super-featherweight title. He has had 24 fights and lost just one of them, a rematch against Leo Santa Cruz for the super featherweight belt in January.
Taylor, 26, is far less experienced but has won all of his nine fights as a professional, eight of them by way of knockout.
And Frampton revealed he rates Taylor so highly he even studies the Scot in action.
"He's one of the only guys I hang around and watch sparring," Frampton added. "When you're surrounded by boxing you sometimes want to get away but when Taylor is sparring I hang around because I feel I can learn from him and pick things up - he's brilliant."
Taylor, the Glasgow 2014 Commonwealth Games gold medallist, defends his Commonwealth super-lightweight title against England's WBC Silver champion Ohara Davies at Glasgow's Braehead Arena on 8 July.
And Frampton has only one piece of advice for the Scot.
"He's never asked for advice and I think the only bit of advice would be to remain calm," he added.
"At times he's hot-headed and he likes to have a fight when he doesn't need to - the William Wallace comes out in him. If Josh can remain disciplined in the ring and stick to the game-plan, there's not a fighter in Britain at the minute that can touch him."
