The Bannsiders earned five straight wins in January including Premiership victories over Linfield, Portadown, Ballinamallard United and Ards.
Coleraine have since extended their winning run to seven straight games.
That was a major turnaround in fortunes after a six-game run without a victory prior to the New Year.
"I'm absolutely delighted following a disappointing December to be in this position," said Kearney.
The Bannsiders have reached the last eight of the Irish Cup, where they will face local rivals Ballymena United.
