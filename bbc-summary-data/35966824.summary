Attempted rape of girl by man on bail 'should be investigated'

An inquiry should take place into how a man was able to try to rape a nine-year-old girl while on bail for rape, a councillor says.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Steven Partridge, 24, was jailed for eight years for attempted rape and abducting a child in Westcliff-on-Sea near Southend, Essex, in November 2014.
Kent Police said he had been arrested and bailed for a sex assault on a 19-year-old in Folkestone in August 2014.
Southend councillor Martin Terry said he was "outraged" by what had happened.
"If someone's a known offender, that should be notified to the council by the police. My question is, how was he out on bail?" Mr Terry said.
"I've written to the chiefs of Essex and Kent Police and the police and crime commissioners asking for an inquiry into how this came about."
Last week, Partridge, of Southend, was given an extended sentence of six years' imprisonment for the earlier rape, and a three-year concurrent sentence for sexual assault.
He was also given a three-year extension to his three-year licence period, bringing his total sentence to 14 years in prison and six on licence.
The BBC has asked Kent Police to confirm Partridge's bail conditions at the time of his arrest in August 2014.
