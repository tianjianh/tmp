[SN]TITLE[SN]
Lord Hardie to chair inquiry into Edinburgh trams fiasco

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The former Lord Advocate Lord Hardie is to chair the inquiry into the Edinburgh trams fiasco.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
First Minister Alex Salmond made the announcement in the Scottish Parliament.
The inquiry will try to find out why the project - with a final bill of Â£776m - was delayed and went badly over-budget.
The Scottish capital's trams began running on 31 May, after six years of disruption and cost increases.
Mr Salmond told MSPs it would be a "swift and thorough" inquiry.
The first minister had previously cited "considerable public concern" over the project, which he said had disrupted homes and businesses in Edinburgh.
The problems included a dispute between the city council and its contractor.
