Sheffield Wednesday have offered a new deal to midfielder Jose Semedo.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 31-year-old Portuguese player joined the Owls from Charlton in July 2011 and has made 134 league appearances, scoring once.
However, he featured just 16 times for Wednesday last season as they suffered defeat by Hull City in the Championship play-off final.
Goalkeeper Lewis Price, 31, and striker Caolan Lavery, 23, have also been offered new contracts.
