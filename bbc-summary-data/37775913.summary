Cultural Leonesa 1-7 Real Madrid

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Real Madrid thrashed third-tier Cultural Leonesa in the first leg of the Copa del Rey round-of-32 tie.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Madrid, who rested Cristiano Ronaldo, Gareth Bale and Karim Benzema, took the lead with an own goal by ex-West Brom defender Gianni Zuiverloon.
Marco Asensio and Alvaro Morata scored twice each, making them Real's joint top scorers this season with five.
Nacho scored a stunning flying volley to make it 6-0, with Benja puling one back before Mariano's late strike.
The second leg at the Bernabeu is on Wednesday, 30 November.
Real played their first leg a month before everyone else because of their involvement in the Fifa World Club Cup in December, as did Barcelona last season.
