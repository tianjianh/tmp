Haiti became the world's first black-led republic and the first independent Caribbean state when it threw off French colonial control and slavery in the early 19th century.

President: Jovenel Moise
Jovenel Moise was sworn in as president in February 2017.
His inauguration ended a protracted electoral crisis that began in October 2015, when elections were annulled over allegations of fraud.
Mr Moise was finally declared the winner of the November 2016 presidential elections by an electoral tribunal in January 2017.
A businessman and the chosen successor of former President Michel Martelly, Mr Moise has never held political office.
Social media were used as a communications channel after the 2010 quake. The first images of the disaster came from citizens' mobile phones.
About 12% of the population was online by the end of 2014 (Internetworldstats).
