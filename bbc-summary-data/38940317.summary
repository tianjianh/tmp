[SN]TITLE[SN]
Cambridge United 3-2 Newport County

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Cambridge United fought back from 2-0 down to beat Newport with a contentious injury-time penalty.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Mitch Rose was sent off in the incident that saw Joe Day save George Maris' spot kick, but Mark Roberts bundled home the rebound on 93 minutes.
Two goals from Ryan Bird looked to have given Newport only a second win in their last 17 League Two fixtures.
But substitute Barry Corr pulled one back for the hosts before skipper Leon Legge equalised.
Newport County boss Graham Westley told BBC Wales Sport:
"It is tough for the lads to take, having put in a strong effort for the largest part of the game.
"There is a big foul in the build up to the equalising goal, which is hard to accept.
"But that is nothing like the desolation they felt at the awarding of the penalty.
"The opposition dug-out were bemused by the awarding of the penalty.
"Even the implementation of the rules were wrong, in my view. I thought double jeopardy had gone out of the game and the red card was unnecessary.
"Nobody on their side was appealing for a penalty. They wanted a corner. There were bizarre decisions all afternoon."
