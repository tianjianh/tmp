Coleman's side remain unbeaten but are currently third in Group D and four points behind leaders the Republic of Ireland.
Wales, who reached the semi-finals of Euro 2016, face Martin O'Neill's Irish team in Dublin in their next qualifier on 24 March.
"It's still all to look forward to for us," Coleman told BBC Wales Sport.
"We're in a position in this campaign where we have a say in it. I'm still super excited and Russia is definitely not out of the equation."
Only the group winners are guaranteed an automatic spot at the finals in Russia with the eight best runners-up from the nine qualifying groups advancing to the play-offs.

Wales began their qualifying campaign with a 4-0 win against Moldova in Cardiff but drew the following three games against Austria away and at home to Georgia and Serbia.
Coleman's side are ranked top seeds in the group and the manager admits expectations have been high following their summer exploits at the European Championships in France.
"I think one or two people have made a little bit more of our situation than they should have but that's expectation," Coleman said.
"If this was the last campaign and we were four points behind the leaders and playing them in the next game and halfway through the campaign, we would be saying 'this is great.'
"Expectations have changed. We've drawn our last three games and definitely should have won two of them.
"But nevertheless we've got to look at it in the bigger picture - we've lost one campaign game in 16 and that's some record in itself.
"Our players are getting better and the team's getting better. They've got some journey this team."
