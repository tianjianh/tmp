[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Maurice Blair crossed for the visitors in the first minute before Jake Webster and Ryan Hampshire put Cas ahead.
Minns, Albert Kelly and Graeme Horne helped Rovers take the lead but Jy Hitchcox reduced the deficit.
Rovers reached 11 tries as Ken Sio and Iain Thornley scored twice, Minns added two more and Mitchell Allgood got one.
A third Super League win for Hull KR this term moved them into 10th place above Leeds, while Castleford remain seventh.
The Robins entered into the match off the back of a 22-36 defeat by Championship side Oldham Roughyeds in the Challenge Cup, but produced an emphatic performance.
Both sides had players sin-binned when Paul McShane and Shaun Lunt clashed off the ball, but Rovers' score of 38-0 in the second-half showed their dominance.
Castleford head coach Daryl Powell:
"I thought Hull were excellent right from the start. They beat us in every department but it was clearly unacceptable in our approach and things have to change quickly.
"We spoke about our home form but that was embarrassing. It was just ridiculous.
"It's not what we stand for and there is a lot of work to be done before next week's home game with St Helens.
"The more we went after it, the worse we got."
Hull KR interim head coach James Webster:
"It's been a tough week mentally and physically. A lot of things were said and we spoke during the week.
"It's easy to say stuff to make you feel better but it is another thing going out doing it against a good team away from home.
"We knew the proof would be in the pudding but we were good enough for long enough to get the job done. I am proud of the players.
"But while it was fantastic what we turned out today, it's frustrating we can't do it every week - that's our challenge now."
