The Spain international, 31, has not played since mid-October after injuring an Achilles in Arsenal's 6-0 Champions League win over Ludogorets.
Arsenal said his problem "had not progressed" and that he would travel to Sweden next week for surgery.
Cazorla missed seven months of last season with a knee injury.
He has scored two goals in 11 games in all competitions for the Gunners this term.
Arsenal said "surgery is required to the plantaris tendon" in Cazorla's right foot.
