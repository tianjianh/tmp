The nurse Sarah Tooley told the jury she had spoken with Mr Stewart on the phone in May.
He had been to visit Broadstairs in Kent where Ms Bailey had a holiday cottage.
"He'd had thoughts of jumping off a cliff while he was down there," said Ms Tooley.
Earlier, the court was told Mr Stewart had tried to divert a police search of the garage.
According to a statement from Det Con Hollie Daines, read to the court, Mr Stewart said: "If searches are going to take place, you wouldn't find anything in the garage."
When they arrived, DC Daines said Mr Stewart told her he had considered suicide.
She said: "He appeared to be anxious and uncomfortable with what we were asking of him."
On the day of Ms Bailey's disappearance, Mr Stewart claimed he found a note from the Electra Brown author saying she had gone to the holiday cottage in Broadstairs.
According to a statement read to the court, he told police: "If Helen does come back, I don't think I want to be with her any more."
Mr Stewart, of Baldock Road, Royston, Hertfordshire, denies charges of murder, preventing a lawful burial, fraud and three counts of perverting the course of justice.
The trial continues.
