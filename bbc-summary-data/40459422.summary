The 15-seat cinema will screen On the Bench, by Leeds artist Harry Meadley, whose work inspired films from other countries that will also be shown.
Organisers UP Projects said the programme includes 15 films from nine countries.
On the Bench features conversations with eight people and the other films come from Saudi Arabia, New Zealand, Niger, Iran, Ireland, Poland, Italy, Germany the UK and US.
They echo themes of On the Bench, with stories of people finding their way against the backdrop of their own cultures through perseverance and determination.
The cinema will visit Rotherham, Swinton, Doncaster, Thorne, Goole, South Ferriby before reaching Hull.
The idea of a cinema on a customised narrowboat was conceived in 2011 by artists Nina Pope and Karen Guthrie to connect communities during the London Olympics.
A larger boat was designed for the current floating cinema by Duggan Morris Architects in 2013.
Annabel Grundy of Film Hub North said the Yorkshire floating cinema project aims to give "the widest range of cinematic stories from all over the world".
"We are delighted to see a Yorkshire tour of floating films as part of this year's celebrations," she said.
Tickets are free, but can be booked in advance.
