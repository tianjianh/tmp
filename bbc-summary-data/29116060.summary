[SN]TITLE[SN]
MP Nigel Evans reselected to stand in General Election

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
MP Nigel Evans has been reselected to stand as the Conservative Party candidate for the Ribble Valley in next year's general election.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Mr Evans, 56, was chosen after a secret ballot during a meeting in Clitheroe, Lancashire, with members of the local Conservative Association.
He resigned the party whip and sat as an independent MP as he fought a number of sexual offences, of which he was cleared.
Mr Evans rejoined the party in April.
He had the Conservative whip restored after a jury unanimously found him not guilty of all the allegations after a five-week trial.
Mr Evans also stood down from his post as Deputy Commons Speaker to fight the claims.
He made a statement to executive members to secure his candidacy during the meeting at the Conservative Club, where he "spoke from the heart".
Speaking after the ballot, Mr Evans said: "It's something that I have dreamed of for a while.
"To get that now means the party can be united and concentrate on winning the local elections of 2015 and of course win the General Election.
"I'm relieved... I'm just delighted."
The Swansea-born MP has represented the Ribble Valley since 1992.
