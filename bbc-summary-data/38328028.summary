The 29-year-old central defender's deal will now run until June 2018 following Saturday's 1-1 draw with Carlisle.
Former Celtic youngster Cuthbert joined the Hatters in 2015 from Leyton Orient, playing 58 times.
"Since I came to the club, Scott has been a leader on and off the pitch," said Hatters manager Nathan Jones.
