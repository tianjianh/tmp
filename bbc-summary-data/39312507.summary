[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Second-half goals from Mark Beevers and Adam Le Fondre wrapped up a fifth successive win for Phil Parkinson's in-form side.
Bolton defender David Wheater saw a shot deflected over the crossbar, before skipper Darren Pratley tested Shrewsbury goalkeeper Jayson Leutwiler from distance.
The Shrews gradually settled and almost took the lead when Louis Dodds, fed by Tyler Roberts, saw his high shot acrobatically clawed away by Bolton keeper Ben Alnwick.
Joe Riley then drilled in a shot from the edge of the box which was comfortably gathered by Alnwick.
Bolton took the lead in the 51st minute as a long throw from Filipe Morais saw central defender Beevers nip in ahead of Leutwiler to head home from 12 yards.
Alnwick saved from Freddie Ladapo and Roberts either side of Bolton's breakthrough, before the visitors doubled their lead in the 66th minute.
Morais broke down the right and picked out Le Fondre, who controlled the ball and smashed into the roof of the net from close range.
Shaun Whalley fired a late effort over the bar for Shrewsbury, who are just a point outside the relegation zone.
