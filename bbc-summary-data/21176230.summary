A dolphin tangled up in a fishing line in Hawaii swam up to divers, seemingly to ask for help.

Martina Wing, who captured the footage, said the dolphin approached one of the divers and waited patiently as he was cut free.
The diver then spent eight minutes cutting the tangled line from the mammal, which then swam away unharmed.
After the rescue the diver said the dolphin had nudged itself into him as if he was asking for help.
