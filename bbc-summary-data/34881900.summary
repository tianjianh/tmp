[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A water company has raised more than £900,000 selling off 30 disused sites, including a sewage pumping station, at auction.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
South West Water's sale (SWW) included the Kilworthy reservoir at Tavistock in Devon which fetched £170,000.
The plot in Tavistock was advertised as a Grand Designs project on the website of estate agents Webbers, with planning permission for a house.
SWW said half the proceeds would go back to customers through lower bills.
Other lots included Kerley Water Storage Tank at Chacewater near Truro in Cornwall which sold for £30,000 and the Voskelly Water Pumping Station near St Mawes which sold for £9,400.
Guy Busby, head of property and support services at SWW, said its aim in auctioning "redundant assets" was to cut costs and bills.
