Thames Valley Police said the family of the 57-year-old from Rotherham had been informed and were being given support.
Mr Cresswell is the third victim to be recovered since the boiler house partially collapsed in February. John Shaw, 61, also from Rotherham, is the last workman yet to be found.
A guard of honour was formed as Mr Cresswell was taken from the site.
Representatives of the missing men's families joined police and fire and rescue crews, and staff from site owners RWE and contractors Coleman and Company, as his body was taken away early on Thursday morning.
A police spokesman said: "Our thoughts are with his family and also with the family of the remaining missing man, John Shaw, and we would ask that their privacy is respected during this incredibly difficult time."
The body of a third man Christopher Huxtable, 34, from Swansea was found last week.
A fourth man, Michael Collings, 53, from Brotton, Teesside, died from multiple injuries following the partial collapse of the structure in February when it was due for demolition.
The remaining section was brought down using explosives in July.
