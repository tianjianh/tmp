The Royals defend regal mistakes in new TV drama

E!, famed for its reality TV productions like Keeping Up With the Kardashians, is giving the world its first scripted TV show.

Called The Royals, it's about a fictional British royal family and stars Elizabeth Hurley as Queen Helene.
The show is already being dubbed "loveable trash" by some critics.
"She is the Queen of England, isn't she?" said Oliver Milburn who plays Ted, the royal family's top security guard.
Well yes, she is the Queen of England, but what's happened to her sovereignty over Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland?
"What the real Queen? She's the head of all those nations I think, but isn't she known as the Queen of England? I don't know, I'm no expert on royal anything."
BuzzFeed took issue with a few of the dramatized situations in the show, like the fact the King's brother tries to kill him and doesn't appear to think he will go to prison rather than automatically taking ownership of the crown.
Elizabeth Hurley took on the role of Queen Helena in the drama and says she hopes Brits will love it as much as Americans do.
"Americans, traditionally. are quite enamoured with our real royal family, they think they're the bees knees. I do too as it happens.
"So I knew there'd be a lot of interest in the show and in fact they have responded very well to our scurrilous, fake royal family.
"I'm thrilled that they like it and I'm really hoping that English people will get in the spirit and enjoy it too and just imagine what it could be like behind the closed doors of the palace."
Again and again, each member of the cast said none of the characters were based on any of the real royal family, hammering home that point, even without being prompted.
William Moseley, of Narnia fame, plays Prince Liam and says he's gearing up for the "sceptical faces".
"This is the first time royal life has been depicted like this. I think there's been a few sceptical faces out there, but I think once they watch the first five minutes of the show, they'll see how much fun and joy that is brought to the screen.
"I think they think we're trying to depict the royal family but we're really not.
"This is our fantasy of royal life, [that] we all hope royal life to be. So it's kind of like, through the key hole kind of feel. It's no imitation of the royal family at all."
William says if people want to draw comparisons to real life royals - erm, Prince Harry? - then "that is entirely up to you".
But all in all, it's supposed to be fun.
And who wouldn't want to play the queen at least once in your lifetime? Liz?
"I very much liked playing a fictitious queen of England. I'm actually quite jealous of the real one now, I wouldn't mind swapping for a bit. I'm not sure she'd be happy with my life, but I think I could enjoy hers."
