An extreme runner from Cardiff has completed a 270-mile (435 km) route across the hottest place on earth.

Rhys Jenkins, 27, ran the equivalent of 10 marathons in just over four days across Death Valley in California.
He aimed to finish in 96 hours, which would have set a Guinness World Record for the fastest double crossing on foot, but managed 107.
With temperatures reaching 56.7C, the desert in California is normally home to just venomous snakes and scorpions.
Rhys Jenkins was running with his brother, Scott, but the 34-year-old was dogged by injury and could not complete the the full 270 miles.
"Scott is obviously devastated," said his girlfriend Abby Fleming.
"Both men had roughly seven hours sleep during their challenge and have raised more than Â£5,000 of their Â£10,000 target.
"They are also the first siblings to run Death Valley and the first Welsh people to run Death Valley."
