[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 15-year-old, from Measham, Leicestershire, was last seen after she was dropped off outside Ibstock Community College on 13 November.
Her body was later found in undergrowth in a field near Ibstock after a huge police search of the surrounding area.
Stephen Beadman, 28, from Ibstock, has been charged with rape and murder.
The inquest at Loughborough Coroners' Court was also told her body had to be identified by dental records.
Luke Harlow, 27, also from Ibstock, appeared in court on Friday charged with grooming and two counts of sexual activity with a child.
Both men are due to appear at Leicester Crown Court on 18 December.
The inquest was adjourned until February.
Kayleigh's family said they were "heartbroken" following the discovery of the body on Wednesday.
Hundreds of people attended a special vigil at St Laurence Church in Measham on Thursday evening, and purple balloons - Kayleigh's favourite colour - were released into the air.
