[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Iain Henderson will make his first Ulster appearance of the season in Friday's European Champions Cup game against Saracens at Kingspan Stadium.

A hand injury has kept Henderson out since Ireland's World Cup quarter-final defeat by Argentina on 18 October.
The Ulster line-up includes Andrew Trimble, Ruan Pienaar and Rory Best.
Saracens coach Mark McCall makes two changes from the opening 32-7 win over Toulouse, with hooker Schalk Brits and flanker Jacques Burger drafted in.
South Africa hooker Brits replaces Jamie George and Burger returns in place of Will Fraser after a one-week suspension.
Brad Barritt will captain Saracens - his 150th appearance for the north London club - while fellow England internationals Richard Wigglesworth and Owen Farrell continue at half-back.

Former Ulster coach McCall names Argentina World Cup star Marcelo Bosch on the Saracens bench.
Henderson joins Chris Henry and Nick Williams in the Ulster back row as the Irish province play their first game in the competition after the postponement of last weekend's match against Oyonnax.
Captain Best links up with Callum Black and Wiehahn Herbst in the front row, with Dan Tuohy and Franco van der Merwe named in the lock berths.
Springboks star Pienaar will start in the half-backs alongside Paddy Jackson for the first time this season.
Friday's match will be the first European meeting between the clubs since Saracens beat Ulster in the Heineken Cup quarter-finals in Belfast two seasons ago.
Ulster full-back Jared Payne was sent off in the early stages of that game and the influential Pienaar was also forced off by injury as Saracens won 17-15.
Ulster number eight Nick Williams:
"There is no element of revenge. It's a new competition, a new team with new personnel.
"They have a very physical pack, they like to play a direct style and they are always tough to play against.
"You look for a weakness in their team but you struggle to find one.
"Toulouse were maybe a bit emotional given the events that occurred in France and they maybe played the way Saracens wanted them to."
Saracens coach Mark McCall:
"Ulster are one of the best in Europe, and we've had some classic battles with them in recent years.
"I know how tough a place the Kingspan Stadium can be when it's rocking on a European night.
"So to be facing them is a real challenge for us, but one that we are all very excited by."
