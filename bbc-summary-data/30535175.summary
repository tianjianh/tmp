Organisers expect about 100 competitors to gather in West Sussex to take part in the final round of the championship.
They aim to beat Australian Peter Dimmers, currently the world leader after completing 10 laps of a 28ft (8.55m) circuit in 23.12 seconds.
"That is really quick," said organiser Andy Player, joint founder of Worthing HO Racing.
Mr Player founded the slot car club, which meets at the English Martyrs Church Hall in Goring-By-Sea, with Robin Cornwall in 2010.
Saturday's competition, which will decide the winner of the 2014 Scalextric World Championship, follows similar rounds in Singapore, Barbados and Australia.
Previous UK rounds have been in Devon, Moray, Kent and at the Heritage Motor Museum in Warwickshire and Maldon Motor Show in Essex.
Mr Player said he expected most of Saturday's competitors to come from the Sussex area.
Six at a time will race against each other using the same layout, the same 1/64th scale cars and the same controllers as the other championship events.
The fastest time recorded in Worthing will take its place on the world leader board.
Mr Player, an official adjudicator for Scalextric, which is based in Margate, Kent, said he did not expect Mr Dimmers' time to be beaten but some of the Worthing contenders might come close.
He said some of the best racers were in their early teens.
"Often they have got far better hand-eye co-ordination and reflexes than their parents," he said.
"One of our youngsters came ninth in the World Championships last year with a time of 29 seconds.
"I think his dad will make sure he competes this time."
