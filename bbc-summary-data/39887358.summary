Greater Manchester Police said the couple and two young children were surrounded by six men with balaclavas and masks in south Manchester.
The gang threatened the family with a gun but could not steal the car because of the keyless ignition system.
A 19-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of robbery.
The family was confronted by the men as they returned home on Woodpecker Road, Chorlton, in their white Mercedes C Class.
The gang stole the car after threatening the family with a gun but had to flee empty handed when they could not start the car.
The arrested man was detained following a police chase which ended on Plymouth Grove, in the Longsight district of Manchester.
Appealing for witnesses Det Insp Tony Lea said : "This was a terrifying robbery targeting a young family, purely because they have a nice car.
"Luckily there were no injuries, but we could have had a tragedy on our hands."
