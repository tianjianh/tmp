Laverty revealed last month that he would be returning to the Superbike series after two seasons in MotoGP.
On Thursday, Laverty's place in the Milwaukee Aprilia team was confirmed alongside 2015 World Superstock champion Lorenzo Savadori.
Laverty earned 10 wins during his previous World Superbike series stint.
"I'm excited to return to Superbike with Aprilia and the RSV4, a bike with which I took 10 wins and second place overall in the championship," said the Toomebridge man.
"I hope to be able to pick up where I left off with those results, thanks to the support of Aprilia and a fantastic team like Shaun Muir's. Everything is in place for us to be competitive straight away".
The Milwaukee team will receive factory support and technical assistance from Aprilia Racing.
"Shaun Muir's team, after making a good name for themselves in the British championship, wants to get to the top of a world category," said Aprilia Racing's manager Romano Albesiano.
"Our agreement includes, in addition to providing bikes and materials, support from Aprilia Racing personnel to manage and develop the RSV4, within a factory support type relationship.
"The birth of the Milwaukee Aprilia Racing Team also marks Eugene Laverty's return to WSBK, a rider who we know well and whose professional and personal qualities have our utmost respect."
Laverty opted to switch from MotoGP as he faced the prospect of having to ride an uncompetitive GP15 bike for the Aspar Ducati team in 2017.
