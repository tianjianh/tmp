Wales head coach Warren Gatland is the logical choice to coach the British and Irish Lions in New Zealand next year, says All Blacks boss Steve Hansen.

New Zealander Gatland coached the Lions to a series win in Australia in 2013.
He has been named as the leading contender for the job by Lions chief executive John Feehan.
"Gatland should be the front runner," Hansen said. "He's taken the Lions away before and been successful. But who knows?"
England coach Eddie Jones ruled himself out of the running for the post earlier this year.
Former Ireland international Keith Wood, though, believes Gatland and Jones should both be part of the British and Irish Lions coaching team in New Zealand.
Jones, who succeeded Stuart Lancaster in December 2015, led England to the 2016 Six Nations Grand Slam and completed a series whitewash over Australia last month.
The Australian has said Gatland would be the obvious choice to lead the team for a second time.
"Warren did a fantastic job in the last tour and there's no reason why he shouldn't take them again," Jones said in January.
