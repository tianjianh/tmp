Shropshire armed robber raided bank, shop and stole car

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A bank robber threatened staff with a gun before car-jacking a woman and driving her vehicle to a second armed raid on a shop in Shropshire.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A man with a handgun ordered staff at Barclays Bank in Shifnal to hand over money at about 15:30 GMT on Friday.
Shortly afterwards, a woman was forced out of a silver Vauxhall Vectra, and later staff at One Stop in Market Drayton were held at gunpoint.
Police have released CCTV images of a suspect in the linked attacks.
He is described as white, clean shaven and aged in his late 20s or early 30s. He was dressed in black and carrying a black holdall.
Det Sgt Mat Crisp, of West Mercia Police, said: "A man has committed a series of very serious offences in quick succession and we're keen to identify him quickly to prevent him from doing it again.
"We're sure someone will recognise this man and we'd urge anyone with information to contact us as soon possible."
