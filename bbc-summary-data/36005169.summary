[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The crash happened close to Cornakinnegar Bridge between Moira, County Down, and Lurgan, County Armagh. at about 17:35 BST on Friday.
Ms Buchanan was in the back seat of one of the vehicles involved. A number of other people suffered minor injuries.
It was one of several crashes on the same section of road that resulted in very long tailbacks.
Initially, the police closed one lane of the motorway, but later closed both.  Some motorists were caught up in the delays for a number of hours.
The police said they understood that the closure caused frustration and inconvenience, but said it was vital that a thorough examination of the scene was able to take place.
The motorway has now reopened to traffic.
