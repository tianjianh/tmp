The ex-serviceman from Paignton, Devon, said he started getting really bored after his wife Cassie died two years ago.
"I was bored to death sat here doing nothing not seeing anyone," he said as he placed an ad in the Herald Express.
And it turned out his ad was just the job because he has had two offers of work - at a local cafe and at Tesco.
Mr Bartley, who served in the 6th Airborne Division after World War Two and later in the Royal Engineers, said he missed his active life.
"I just can't be sitting here doing nothing, so I put an ad in the paper," he said.
"When you live in a flat it's pretty lonely.
"It's like being in solitary confinement. You don't see anybody."
He reckons there are many more like him.
He said: "It depends on your personality and how you feel.
"Some people retire at 65 and they say to themselves 'I'm old and I'll just tend the garden'.
"But some want to carry on working."
