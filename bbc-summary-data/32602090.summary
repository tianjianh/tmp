County Championship: Glamorgan declaration angers Welch

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A dispute has broken out over Glamorgan's first-innings declaration against Derbyshire on a rain-hit day.

Derbyshire are to investigate if they can make an official complaint after Glamorgan closed their first innings on 103-4, 102 runs behind.
Around 40 minutes of play remained at the end of day three.
Derbyshire boss Graeme Welch said he was" not happy", but home captain Jacques Rudolph says they were "well within" their rights.
Welch believes the move should not have been allowed as it deprived them of the chance of two further bowling points.
In the event, bad light and rain prevented the players from resuming anyway.
The scheduled session would have given Glamorgan the chance to recover their poor over-rate from the first innings, which could see them lose all three bowling points if there is no further play.
Rudolph said the motive was "not a big factor" because the county had been behind on over-rates at stages in their other games.
"We were well within the follow-on total. They've got an inexperienced batting line-up and with our bowling line-up in perfect bowling conditions, we felt we could potentially get into them," said Rudolph.
Welch said: "The situation we're in, Glamorgan have declared, in my opinion depriving us of two bowling points.
"The sole reason is to get their over-rate back. If they want to spin it like they want to make a game of it, they can do.
"But, in my opinion, it's classed as an extraordinary declaration which is not allowed."
Asked if Lord's had been consulted for a ruling, Welch said: "It went around a few people and that's why we had a delayed start because there wasn't really anybody making any decisions."
Rudolph said Glamorgan have now discussed the issue of getting through their overs more quickly in future.
Only 29 balls were bowled on day three, with showers and bad light repeatedly intervening before the controversial conclusion.
