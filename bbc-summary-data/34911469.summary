[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
David Mackintosh's party received a £6,195 payment for tickets from Howard Grossman, the director of a company overseeing work at Northampton Town FC.
Mr Mackintosh was leader of the borough council when it approved a £10.25m loan for the plans. Millions of pounds of the money is currently unaccounted for.
He declined to comment on the payments.
Three individuals with links to Mr Grossman also paid £10,000 into Mr Mackintosh's general election fighting fund, a BBC investigation found.
The payment to Mr Mackintosh's party from Mr Grossman and one of the donations for £10,000 were not declared to the Electoral Commission.
Failure to declare donations could, dependant on the circumstances, result in a fine or even be a criminal offence.
A Conservative Party spokesman said: "We are looking into the matter."
Mr Grossman was director of 1st Land, the company set up to oversee the rebuild of the League Two club's Sixfields stadium. It subsequently went into administration.
Efforts are now being made to trace the £10.25m loan. Work on the stadium remains incomplete and the main contractor is owed £2m.
Mr Mackintosh, who was elected as Northampton South MP in May, oversaw the authority's role in the Sixfields project and the unsecured loan.

loan given to the club by Northampton Borough Council

The BBC has examined the close links between Mr Mackintosh and Howard Grossman, owner of the County Group, at the time planning permission was granted.
Two years ago Mr Mackintosh attended a celebrity ball at the Dorchester Hotel in London paid for by the County Group. It was six days before a crucial planning meeting, although Mr Mackintosh himself was not on the planning committee.
His £500 ticket for the Amy Winehouse Foundation fundraiser, attended by stars such as Pixie Lott, Barbara Windsor and Jerry Hall, is not recorded in his borough council declaration of gifts and hospitality.
However, it is included in Mr Mackintosh's declaration as a Northamptonshire county councillor.
Mr Grossman was involved in a general election fundraising event for Mr Mackintosh last November at the prestigious Conservative Carlton Club in London.
The £295-a-head gathering was organised by Northampton Conservatives, but several personal invitations were sent out by the businessman, telling a Sixfields contractor it was a "great opportunity for meeting and be involved with nhampton (Northampton) council".

November 2015: Police start full-scale investigation into "alleged financial irregularities" involved in the loan to the football club, while it is announced a takeover deal at Northampton Town may stop it going into administration.
Mr Grossman subsequently sent £6,195 to Northampton South Conservative Association.
The following month, Northampton Borough Council approved outline planning permission for the land adjacent to Sixfields.
The BBC has looked at the accounts of Northampton South Conservative Association. Between May and June last year, three payments of £10,000 each were made from the following:
It is perfectly legal and normal for business people to give money to political campaigns but there are rules about declaring those payments.
Suresh Patel, the chairman of Northampton South Conservatives and the MP's election agent, went to the Conservative Party chairman Lord Feldman last week. He gave him a dossier detailing his concerns about the links between Mr Mackintosh and Mr Grossman, and for the first time admitted that the £10,000 from Mr Platt had not been declared. The receipt from Mr Grossman was not specifically discussed.
Mr Patel confirmed to the BBC that the undeclared payment from Mr Grossman was for tickets to an election fundraising event.
He said the Electoral Commission was not informed of the payment by Mr Platt because of an administrative error. The payments by Mr Mayfield and Mr Western were passed on.  Mr Patel has since notified  the Commission of the Platt payment.
In a statement via his solicitors, Mr Grossman told the BBC: "Howard Grossman paid £6,195 for tickets to attend an event hosted by Mr Mackintosh as part of his election campaign. Mr Grossman is unable to comment on contributions made from other individuals you have mentioned."
By law, personal donations of more than £500 and donations to local associations of more than £1,500 must be declared to the Electoral Commission.
