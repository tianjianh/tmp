Violet McAfee, 44, was in the garden of a friend's house when three bikes crashed during Saturday's opening race.
She suffered serious head and leg injuries. She was taken to hospital by helicopter. Her condition is stable.
Two riders were also taken to hospital. One, Stephen Thompson, is also now in a stable condition.
Horst Saiger returned home to Liechtenstein on Monday after being treated in Coleraine's Causeway hospital for a broken arm.
Dean Harrison was unhurt.
Ms McAfee - who is a mother of one - and Mr Thompson are both being treated at Belfast's Royal Victoria Hospital.
Violet's partner said he did not want to comment on the actual crash.
"It is just one of those freak accidents that happens. I cannot say much more about it," he said.
He told BBC NI's Good Morning Ulster programme that both he and Violet enjoyed going up to see the race when they were off work.
The crash happened at a friend's house, he said.
"There was a spectator who was an orthopaedic surgeon and he was very quickly on the scene," he said.
"Then, obviously Dr Fred McSorley treated her, to be honest she may not have been here - his quick thinking maybe saved things."
Speaking about Ms McAfee, he said: "She is stable at the minute obviously. But the next week or so will be the big milestone for her."
He said one of the riders involved in the crash had talked to him.
"Horst Saiger spoke to me and said he wishes her a speedy recovery as well," he said.
"It could have been a lot worse. There were quite a few people about. The marshals also said if my friend's car hadn't been in the way, it could have pulled it on up a few more gardens. The walls are very low."
Violet McAfee is believed to be the first spectator to have been injured in a crash at the North West 200.
Safety concerns have now been raised about racing through residential areas.
A full investigation into the crash is now under way.
North West 200 event director Mervyn Whyte said he had visited the families of both Ms McAfee and Mr Thompson.
In a statement, he said: "The organisers of the North West 200 will offer our full support to Violet and Stephen and their families and I want to assure them that they are in our thoughts and prayers throughout this time."
He added: "I would like to thank the members of the medical team who were involved in treating those who were injured on Saturday.
"The care and expertise they provide is the very best in the world and we are very grateful that we have this available to us at the North West 200."
