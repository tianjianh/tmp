The 37-year-old, who has previously played for Crystal Palace and Millwall, joined the club in the summer of 2010 and has made 73 Gills appearances.
Striker Dennis Oli, 28, has also been told he can leave after starting just one game this season.
Boss Andy Hessenthaler told the club website: "If someone comes in, we will consider them going out [on loan]."
Hessenthaler added: "I've said their contracts are nearly up and we've told them that we won't be offering them a new deal."
Hessenthaler has indicated he would like to reduce the wage bill to give him more chance of signing two transfer targets.
Former Charlton defender Jonathan Fortune and ex-Wolves midfielder Rohan Ricketts have both been training at the club.
I had a text message from the chairman, he's behind us and he'll be behind us until the end if we continue to show that desire, commitment and effort
Hessenthaler continued: "We've said we may be able to do something but that might mean I have to let a couple go on loan.
"I've got to speak to Rohan's agent but he's a different type of player than we've got."
Meanwhile, Hessenthaler has revealed he has received a text from chairman Paul Scally giving him his backing after they lost to Port Vale, their sixth straight defeat.
The Gills boss told BBC Radio Kent: "There have been some top managers in the world who have been sacked so there's no shame in that, but I'm not looking to that.
"I had a text message from the chairman, he's behind us and he'll be behind us until the end if we continue to show that desire, commitment and effort."
