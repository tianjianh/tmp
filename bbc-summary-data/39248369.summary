Sunday's race was won by UK athlete Ben Fish with a time of 01:05:16 and the fastest female runner was Ruth Barnes.
The annual event is in its 36th year but had some changes to the route due to the North Quays works taking place.
Organisers said they believed no African athletes had entered because of better prize money elsewhere in Europe.
The 2016 race was won by Kenyan Robert Mbithi with a time of 1:01:45, setting a new course record.
Some of the celebrities who competed in Sunday's race included actor Will Thorp, broadcaster Sophie Raworth and retired rugby player Lewis Moody MBE.
