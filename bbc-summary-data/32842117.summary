Maíria Cahill allegations: Sir Keir Starmer's report due

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A review into how Northern Ireland's Public Prosecution Service handled allegations of rape and a cover-up will be published later.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Sir Keir Starmer was asked to investigate cases linked to the alleged rape of a woman and claims of an IRA cover-up.
Máiría Cahill told a BBC NI programme that an IRA member raped her when she was a teenager.
She also said the PPS and police did not properly investigate her claims.
Ms Cahill is a member of one of the republican movement's best-known families.
Her great uncle, Joe Cahill, was one of the founders of the Provisional IRA and a long-time associate of Sinn Féin president, Gerry Adams.
Ms Cahill told BBC NI's Spotlight programme last year that an IRA member had raped her when she was a teenager and that four other members of the organisation later covered up the alleged abuse.
Three separate trials later collapsed after she and two other alleged victims withdrew their evidence.
Five people were then acquitted of all charges against them.
Afterwards, Máiría Cahill claimed that one of the key reasons the trials collapsed was the fact that it took more than four years for the cases to go to court.
Sir Keir was appointed in October to examine how the PPS had handled the cases.
