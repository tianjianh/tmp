The GB pair came home fourth in their semi-final on Thursday in a time of 6:38.76 minutes, with just the top three qualifying for Friday's final.
Ireland duo Gary and Paul O'Donovan progressed from the same semi-final.
The Irish brothers, from Cork, finished third in 6:35.70.
The French crew won in 6:34.43, followed by the United States pairing, while South Africa, Norway and Poland qualified from the second semi.
The semi-finals of the event had been scheduled to take place on Wednesday but wind and rain led to them being postponed by a day.
Chambers and his brother Peter were part of Britain's silver medal-winning lightweight fours crew at London 2012.
Peter Chambers' hopes of a second Olympic medal were dashed on Tuesday when the British lightweight fours failed to qualify for the final.
Alan Campbell will compete in the semi-finals of the single sculls on Friday.
Meanwhile Donegal's Chloe Magee has lost her opening game in badminton's women's singles competition, going down 7-21, 12-21, to Wang Yihan of China.
Three players are involved in each group during the group phase and Magee's next match is against Karin Schnasse of Germany on Sunday morning.
She must win that encounter and hope Wang then loses to the German to have a chance of progressing to the knockout rounds.
