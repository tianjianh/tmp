Premier League predictions: Lawro v actor Thomas Turgoose

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
BBC Sport's football expert Mark Lawrenson is pitting his wits against a different guest each week this season.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Lawro's opponent for this weekend's Premier League fixtures is This Is England actor Thomas Turgoose.
Turgoose is a Grimsby Town supporter and interviewed Mariners' boss Paul Hurst ahead of their Conference National play-off final against Bristol Rovers on Sunday.

Lawro thinks Arsenal will beat Sunderland 2-0 in Wednesday's re-arranged game. WWE wrestling star Wade 'Bad News' Barrett went for a 3-0 Gunners win when he gave the rest of his scores in week 33.

A correct result (picking a win, draw or defeat) is worth ONE point. The exact score earns THREE points.
Last weekend, Lawro got six correct results from 10 Premier League games, with three perfect scores.
His score of 12 points saw him beat heptathlete Katarina Johnson-Thompson, who picked four correct results, but with no perfect scores. That gave her a total of four points.
We are keeping a record of the totals for Lawro and his guests (below), and showing a table of how the Premier League would look if all of Lawro's predictions were correct (at the bottom of the page).
All kick-offs 15:00 BST unless otherwise stated.
