Manager Gary Johnson told the club website that the 17-year-old has "had a really good pre-season" this summer.
Bower's first start came against Oxford City in an FA Trophy replay on 26 January last season.
Speaking after that match, Bower told BBC Radio Gloucestershire: "Especially for my dad and my brother, it's a bit of a surreal thing for them watching me play for the team we all support."
Bower, who has played for the club since Under-13 level, added: "If I want to play at this level I need to bulk out massively, otherwise players will just be too physical for me."
