He was attacked after challenging a man found inside Stoke Forgings, Brierley Hill, on Sunday.
Det Insp Colin Mattinson said he suffered serious head injuries after the "sustained and violent attack" at about 13:00 GMT.
He was found by a colleague who started work at about 19:00 GMT.
Mr Mattinson said the guard was believed to have challenged the man who was near an office inside the metal factory in Vine Street.
"Inquiries are continuing and we are studying CCTV and carrying our forensic investigations at the scene," he said.
"We are still trying to establish what the man was doing inside the premises and what, if anything was stolen."
The factory unit has been sealed off for forensic inquiries and neighbourhood officers have increased "reassurance patrols" in the area, a West Midlands Police spokesman said.
Anyone with information about the incident was urged to contact the force on 101 or call Crimestoppers.
