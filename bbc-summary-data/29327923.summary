The St Andrews University collection includes previously unseen images of now-classic Ryder Cup moments.
They are part of an archive of more than 10,000 Levy pictures from the 1980s and 1990s now available online.
Europe and the USA meet for the tournament at Gleneagles this week.
Lawrence Levy was the official photographer for the European Ryder Cup team, and spent 20 years devoted to taking pictures of the sport before he died of cancer aged 47.
The university's special collections team is digitising a collection of more than 250,000 photographs donated by the Joseph Levy Foundation, including 1,500 taken at Ryder Cup tournaments between 1979 and 1993.
The process of digitising the original photographs is ongoing, and collection cataloguer Trevor Ledger said more will be added to the online archive on a weekly basis.
He said: "The Lawrence Levy collection is one of the most complete photographic records of professional golf through the 1980s and 1990s.
"As official photographer for the European team, Lawrence held a unique position and was able to capture some incredible images from inside the ropes - indeed from inside the changing room too."
Images brought together in the collection include Sam Torrance clinching victory for Europe with a 22ft putt at the Belfry in 1985 before celebrating with Howard Clark, returning captain Tom Watson's win in 1993, and pictures of fans, families and media figuresl including Peter Alliss.
