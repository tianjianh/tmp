The Welsh pop legend accused the BBC of "sub-standard behaviour" when it dropped him from the contest last year.
But ITV has bought the rights to broadcast the programme from 2017 and has now invited him back.
He will be joined in the big red chairs by long-serving judge Will.i.am, Oscar-winning actress and singer Jennifer Hudson and rock star Gavin Rossdale.
Sir Tom said: "I had some great times on the show and I can't wait to again discover and help some brand new talent. And of course be back with my pal Will.i.am."
The 76-year-old appeared as a judge on the first four series but was not involved in the latest run.
Last year, he said he was disappointed BBC executives told him "with no consultation or conversation of any kind" that he would not be returning.
Sir Tom is known for hits including It's Not Unusual, Green Green Grass of Home, Delilah and Sex Bomb.
Jennifer Hudson, who appeared on American Idol in 2004, won an Oscar for best supporting actress for Dreamgirls in 2007 and a Grammy Award in 2009.
She said: "I couldn't be more excited to join the amazing panel of coaches on The Voice UK."
Rossdale is the frontman of rock band Bush, the former husband of singer Gwen Stefani and father of model and Strictly Come Dancing contestant Daisy Lowe.
He said he was "so thrilled to be joining The Voice UK" after appearing as a guest on the US version of the series two years ago.
He added: "I have always been extremely proud to fly the flag for British rock music and I can't wait to join this incredible panel and help discover some new talent."
ITV Network head of entertainment Siobhan Greene said she was "absolutely chuffed to bits with the line-up".
She continued: "All four coaches are global artists in the music industry and are at the top of their game."
