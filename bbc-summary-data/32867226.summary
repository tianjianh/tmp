Some areas saw up to 10 inches (25cm) of rain over a 24-hour period, with more predicted across the region.
Twelve people, including two children, were reported missing along the Blanco river in Texas, local media report.
Texas governor Greg Abbott said it was the worst flooding the state had seen, and that he had observed the devastation from the air.
"You cannot candy coat it, it's absolutely massive and I think it sends a powerful message to anyone who is in harm's way over the entire state of Texas over the coming days as we see ongoing rain, and that is the relentless tsunami-type power that this wave of water can pose for people," he said.
Jonathan McComb was staying at a house in Wimberley with his wife and their young son and daughter when they were swept away.
Mr McComb was taken to hospital with serious injuries, but his family has not yet been found. Five others were also reportedly dragged away by the floodwaters.
His father, former county commissioner Joe McComb told Kiii TV: "It is in the Lord's hands... we're praying for the best."
Three deaths have been linked to the flooding in Texas since Saturday, the latest being a 14-year-old boy who was found with his dog in a storm drain in Dallas.
There were numerous rescues on Sunday after banks burst, and hundreds of homes were destroyed across the region.

The Blanco is one of the worst hit rivers in Texas. At one point it crested at 43ft (13m) - some 30ft above the designated flood stage and 7ft higher than the 1929 record.
A flash flood emergency - reserved for the most life-threatening situations - is in effect in the river basin area.
Some 1,000 people nearby were evacuated from their homes and parts of the Interstate 35 highway were flooded and closed.

She said hundreds of people were now in evacuation centres and that floodwaters had washed away five police cars.
