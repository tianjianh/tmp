Rotherham abuse libel case judge reserves decision

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A High Court judge has reserved his decision on a libel action brought over remarks a UKIP MEP made about the Rotherham abuse scandal.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Jane Collins, who represents Yorkshire and Humber, wrongly claimed three MPs knew about child exploitation in the town but failed to intervene.
The MPs - Sir Kevin Barron, John Healey and Sarah Champion - sued for slander and libel.
Mr Justice Warby adjourned the case to a later date.
The litigation was brought when Sir Kevin, MP for Rother Valley, Mr Healey, who represents Wentworth and Dearne, and Ms Champion, MP for Rotherham, complained about a speech given by Mrs Collins at a UKIP conference in September 2014.
It came after a report found about 1,400 children in the area had been abused between 1997 and 2013.
Lawyers for Ms Collins previously argued it was a political speech that did not contain any allegation of fact, but expressed an opinion to the effect that the MPs were likely to have known sexual exploitation was a serious problem in the area.
However, claims made against the three MPs were the "talk of the tearoom" in Parliament in the run-up to the general election and caused "extreme distress", Gavin Millar QC told the court.
He said: "They could not have been more serious for elected politicians serving constituencies in Rotherham."
In 2015, Ms Collins made an offer of amends which was accepted.
However, the amount of compensation could not be agreed so the case went back to court for an assessment of damages, which the MPs have said should be about Â£150,000 each.
The court also heard allegations that Ms Collins had "repeatedly and continuously" tried to avoid a damages settlement being made against her.
Ms Collins, who had previously failed in her attempt to get immunity from prosecution, said her work in the European Parliament meant she could not attend the hearing.
It took place in her absence.
