Brathwaite made an unbeaten 60 to go with his first-innings 142 not out as West Indies chased 154 to win.
It is their first away win against a team other than Bangladesh or Zimbabwe since 2007 and their first win of any kind since beating England in May 2015.
Despite losing the third Test, Pakistan still take the series 2-1.
West Indies had slipped to 67-5 on the fourth day, but Brathwaite combined with wicketkeeper Shane Dowrich in an unbroken stand of 87.
It sealed a first win in 12 attempts as captain for Jason Holder and also gave West Indies their first victory in an away Test against Pakistan since 1990.
"If I could sum up my feelings in one word now, I'd say 'proud'," said Holder. "Proud of the character the guys showed, proud of the fight they showed.
"We have the ability to win Test matches, it is just about stringing together the complete game.
"For the fans back home, and West Indies fans in general, just keep supporting us, keeping giving us that love, and hopefully this team can turn things around."
