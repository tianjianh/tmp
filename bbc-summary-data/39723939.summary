West Heslerton, near Malton, has a 21-bedroom mansion, pub, petrol station, 43 homes and 2,116 acres of land.
The village has been owned by the same family for more than 150 years and was put on the market after the death of the most recent owner.
Cundalls estate agents said it had been acquired by Norfolk-based farming and property investment company, Albanwise.

A spokesman for the firm said the company was due to complete the purchase on Friday and had already had meetings with residents.
The sale price has not been disclosed.
The estate had been inherited by Eve Dawnay in the 1960s but the family decided to sell after her death in 2010.
At the time it was put on the market, residents of the village described it as the "end of an era".
Miss Dawnay was known to have kept rents in the village at a low level which Cundalls said had helped the village remain vibrant.
The estate produces an annual income of about £388,000.
