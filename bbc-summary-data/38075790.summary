Weymouth's council, police, health bosses and other partners have established a board to improve life in the town's Melcombe Regis district.
The area near the town's seafront is widely seen as a crime hotspot, with poor housing and high unemployment.
The newly-formed group aims to improve housing, increase employment and reduce crime.
Weymouth and Portland Borough Council chief executive Matt Prosser, who is chairing the board, said: "We've got some areas where we've got some very poor housing and that is one of the main contributors to the challenges.
"There are some great landlords in Melcombe Regis but there are other landlords who are not investing in their properties and we want to help bring up the standard of all accommodation."
A community worker role has been created for one year to support residents and provide feedback to the board.
Mr Prosser said tackling health problems, unemployment and crime were long-term issues but the community worker would be assessing early on how the community felt about the board's efforts.
According to police figures, there were 265 crimes reported in Melcombe Regis in September, compared with 32 in neighbouring Weymouth East and 62 in Radipole.
These included 42 violent or sexual offences and 23 instances of criminal damage or arson.
