Knight met up with the Jackson racing team in Spain this week for testing, with a view to helping them during the Endurance World Championship (EWC).
Team manager Alan Jackson said the move was sparked after a change in the EWC calendar meant a round in Portugal will clash with the TT races.
Knight, 36, said the chance to work with the team is a "great opportunity".
The Jackson racing team includes 23-time TT winner John McGuinness, fellow Manx rider Conor Cummins and Steve Mercer.
Knight continued: "It is a very strong line-up so maybe I can assist them this season."
Alan Jackson said the calendar change has left the team with a logistical headache to get equipment from the Isle of Man to Portugal.
He said: "Obviously John and Conor's race priorities will fall with the TT races and we understand.
"But we need a contingency and may require an additional rider. If that could be David I would be confident that we are giving Jackson Racing the best opportunity."
