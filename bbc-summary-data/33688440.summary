Olympic heptathlon champion Jessica Ennis-Hill has been named in Great Britain's squad for next month's World Athletics Championships in Beijing.

Ennis-Hill, 29, returned to action in May after having a child and competed in last weekend's Anniversary Games.
Mo Farah, who is also included, will defend his 5,000m and 10,000m titles.

Sprinter Adam Gemili is in the 4x100m relay squad but not in the individual event after injury, while Dina Asher-Smith will only compete in the 200m.
Asher-Smith, 19, set a British record in the 100m at the Olympic Stadium last Saturday after running 10.99 seconds to become the first British female to run under 11 seconds.
Asha Philip is the only British representative in the women's shorter sprint.
Gemili, 21, injured his hamstring when competing in Birmingham last month after running his first sub 10-second time.
Former Olympic champion and London 2012 silver medallist Christine Ohuruogu, 31, will aim to retain her 400m title and seal a third crown, having first won it in 2007.
Elsewhere, 400m runner Martyn Rooney will compete in the relay but not the individual event.
Olympic, Commonwealth and European long jump champion Greg Rutherford is hoping to become only the fifth British athlete - after Daley Thompson, Sally Gunnell, Jonathan Edwards and Linford Christie - to achieve an athletics Grand Slam in China by holding all four major titles.
Ennis-Hill will be joined in the heptathlon by medal rival Katarina Johnson-Thompson, who will also compete in the long jump.

Ennis-Hill's coach Toni Minichello said Britain has "some incredible talent" in multi-discipline events and that Johnson-Thompson and Morgan Lake - who was selected for the high jump - are "way better than Jessica was at the same age".
Former heptathlete Kelly Sotherton told BBC Radio 5 live: "Jess has basically sent out a big message to the rest of the heptahlon fraternity to say 'I'm back and I'm going to Beijing to win gold' and I don't expect her to go for anything less."
Farah will be aiming to complete a hat-trick of world 5,000m titles after taking gold in 2011 and 2013.
Long jumper Shara Proctor has also been selected after setting a British record of 6.98m at the Olympic Stadium on Saturday.
Long-distance runner Andy Vernon, who has had spats on social media with GB team-mates Farah and 800m Commonwealth Games silver medallist Lynsey Sharp in the past, said he was "really disappointed" to be left out.
He failed to meet the qualifying standard for the 5,000m and did so only once for the 10,000m event. "Maybe one day someone in British Athletics will believe in me," he added.
Britain's number one steeplechaser Lennie Waite said she planned to appeal against her omission from the squad. Despite running under the qualifying time for Beijing, rules state she must do this twice.
"I am no stranger to failure," Waite said. "However, I am in the midst of the best track season of my life and I feel I deserve to reap the rewards of my persistence, improvement, and dedication.
"Instead, I feel powerless and undervalued. I live for a challenge and this is just one more barrier that I must hurdle."
To qualify for selection, athletes must either be a reigning World or European champion, or finish in the top two at the British Championships and hit the qualifying times twice.
If an athlete makes the qualifying time once, they may still be selected if the British Athletics selection panel feel they have "realistic potential to finish in the top eight in their event" in Beijing, or they are "a developing athlete" who is progressing towards future Olympic medal success.
All athletes have 24 hours from the squad being announced - so until 14:00 BST on Wednesday, 29 July, to lodge an appeal. They can do so on the basis of two reasons. One, that the selection policy has not been followed. Or two, that there has been a factual error in the selection decision. Appeals will be ruled on swiftly, likely to be by the end of the week.
Zharnel Hughes (200m) and Cindy Ofili (100m hurdles) are selected after qualifying in their first outing as GB athletes since becoming eligible in June.
Hughes, 19, and Ofili, 20, who have held British nationality since birth but have been described as "plastic Brits", secured their places at the British Championships in Birmingham earlier this month.
Ofili's sister Tiffany Porter, 27, who holds dual US and British nationality and switched allegiance to GB in 2010, is also selected in the 100m hurdles.
Triple jumper Nathan Douglas said he had left himself "vulnerable to others' belief, faith and decision" after not making the squad.
Sotherton said she was "sad" to see Douglas and 21-year-old long jumper Jazmin Sawyers not selected, tweeting: "It appears one standard fits some and not others".
