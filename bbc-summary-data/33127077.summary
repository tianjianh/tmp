A Turkish barber's shop where a man accused of a boxer's murder had helped staff, and a bar where the suspect worked, have been attacked and damaged.

A blue van was rammed into the front of Mo's Barber's Shop at Mount Eagle Square at about 03:00 BST on Sunday. It is the second such attack on the shop.
Barman Orhan Koca, 32, who denies murdering boxer Eamonn Magee Jr, had helped out in the barber's.
He also worked at a bar targeted in an attempted arson attack on Friday night.
Decking outside Beckett's Bar on Stewartstown Road was doused in flammable liquid and set on fire causing some scorch damage.
Police said that one of inquiry for both the fire, and the "ramming" attacks was a possible link with the murder of Eamonn Magee Jr.
Det Ch Insp John McVea said: "We are aware of suggestions that these incidents may well be borne out of some misplaced hostility towards various businesses and individuals following Eamonn's tragic murder.
"However I will emphasise that there can be no justification for these attacks."
The officer added: "Everyone we have spoken to as part of our enquiries has been immeasurably cooperative and these actions have no support in this community."
He said that police were conducting "robust investigations" into the attacks.
Mr Koca, 32, who is originally from Turkey, appeared in court in early June.
The 22-year-old son of former WBU welterweight champion, Eamonn Magee Sr, was stabbed on the outskirts of west Belfast last month.
Mr Koca is currently on remand in prison, but had requested that he be segregated after he was attacked and injured in custody.
Turkish businessman Mehmet Emin Oner said his barber shop has been damaged and he also felt personally damaged by the two attacks.
"I was threatened and told to get out in 48 hours. A car was rammed into the shop on Thursday and now again. They will keep on and on," he said.
The businessman said Mr Koca's involvement in his shop was very brief, and that he had tried to help a fellow Turk during a difficult period.
"He was here for about three weeks and I told him to get himself sorted and I would train him. I was just helping him out," he said.
Mr Oner said those who carried out the attacks on his shop were making his life "very difficult".
"But the community have been like brothers and sisters to me. They want it to stop. It is so bad. We are so sorry that the young lad lost his life. Five people's lives have been destroyed. For the family it is dreadful."
Sinn FÃ©in MLA Jennifer McCann condemned the attacks on the shop and bar linked to Mr Koca.
"Attacking the business where the man accused of murdering Eamonn Magee worked will not bring him justice, but only causes further hardship for the local community," she said.
"I visited the barber shop owners this morning who are shocked and dismayed at the attack and I am sure the local community will rally behind this business to ensure that it continues to provide a service."
"If people want to see justice for Eamonn Magee they should cooperate with the PSNI inquiry so that whoever murdered him is brought to justice."
SDLP  councillor Brian Heading said it was a "senseless hate crime".
"Everyone has the right to live and work free of intimidation and the threat of attack," he said.
"The recent trend of attacks in the area is deplorable and I urge those involved to stop what they are doing immediately."
