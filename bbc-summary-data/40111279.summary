A £3m vision to transform a town centre which was once described as "a bit shabby" has been approved.

The revamped Cornhill in Ipswich will include a water feature and sculpture after plans for a tower were dropped.
Work is due to start on the scheme, which was given the green light by the council's planning committee, in January.
Former Marks & Spencer boss Sir Stuart Rose had previously criticised the main town centre square.

The design, drawn up by Belfast-based architects Hall McKnight, revealed a revised "more traditional" design in March after a widespread consultation.
A previously selected vision proposed levelling the Cornhill, which is on a slope, by using a large ramp.
It also featured a "delicate steel and glass" tower in front of the town hall.
Last year, the New Anglia Local Enterprise Partnership announced it is providing £1.6m in funding towards the project.
Suffolk County Council and Ipswich Borough Council have already committed £1.75m.
