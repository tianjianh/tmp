Australian PM Malcolm Turnbull has said his nation is prepared to join a conflict against North Korea if the United States comes under attack.

Pyongyang said on Wednesday it had a plan to fire four missiles near the US territory of Guam.
US President Donald Trump warned North Korea it should be "very, very nervous" if it does anything to the US.
Mr Turnbull said Australia would fulfil its obligations under the Anzus Treaty if an attack on the US took place.
"America stands by its allies, including Australia of course, and we stand by the United States," Mr Turnbull told local radio 3AW on Friday.
"So be very, very clear on that. If there is an attack on the US, the Anzus Treaty would be invoked and Australia would come to the aid of the United States, as America would come to our aid if we were attacked."
Tensions between North Korea and the US have escalated in recent weeks after North Korea tested two intercontinental ballistic missiles in July.
Mr Turnbull described the US alliance as "the absolute bedrock of our national security".
"Now, how that manifests itself obviously will depend on the circumstances and the consultations with our allies," he said.
The prime minister said he had discussed North Korea with US Vice-President Mike Pence in an overnight phone call.
However, he would not say if the pair had spoken about the prospect of Australian assistance.
