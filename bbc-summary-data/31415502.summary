[SN]TITLE[SN]
New code to protect Aberdeen harbour bottlenose dolphins

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A code of practice to protect Bottlenose dolphins near Aberdeen Harbour has been launched.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The city is regarded as one of the best places in Europe to watch dolphin activity.
A taskforce including Aberdeen Harbour Board and Whale and Dolphin Conservation is providing guidance to vessels operating in the port.
Suggestions include boats maintaining a steady course at the slowest possible speed.
Patrick Jordan, environmental advisor at Aberdeen Harbour Board, said: "We are very proud of the incredible diversity of wildlife in the harbour.
"As stewards of this important habitat, we have a clear duty to treat its inhabitants with care and encourage other port users to do the same.
"The Dolphin Code will ensure everyone is made aware of best practices and keep the animals safe."
