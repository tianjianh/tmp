George Osborne announces start of London NHS devolution

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Chancellor George Osborne has signed a health devolution deal for London.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The agreement will see the launch of five pilot schemes designed to transfer power over NHS services from Whitehall to local groups.
It has the backing of Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt, London Clinical Commissioning Groups, NHS England and councils, the Treasury said.
Labour mayoral candidate Sadiq Khan said London could not wait as long as Manchester had for devolved powers.
The five pilot areas include Haringey, Barking and Dagenham with Havering and Redbridge, North Central London - which includes Barnet, Camden, Enfield, Haringey and Islington - as well as Lewisham and Hackney.
Hackney will run a health and social care integration pilot, aiming for full integration of health and social care budgets and joint provision of services. This will also have a particular focus on prevention.
The plan for a local-led, integrated health and social care system by 2020 backed by local authorities was outlined in the spending review.
Mr Osborne, who made the earlier announcement at Great Ormond Street Hospital, said it was "another crucial step in our devolution revolution and is the start of us handing over valuable healthcare power to local leaders in London".
He said it would lead to "better, more joined up healthcare in the capital".
What devolution could mean for London boroughs in five pilot areas
The Treasury said that as part of the agreement the partners involved had agreed to look at the "vast NHS estate in London and increase incentives for trusts to make better use of property".
Mr Johnson said: "As we've shown through transport, policing and planning, devolution is already working in London and this agreement paves the way for a revolution in how health and social care are delivered across the capital.
"With our city's population continuing to grow, it is essential that we have a health service better equipped to manage its own resources so that it can become even more responsive to the needs of Londoners."
It was announced in February that Greater Manchester would obtain full control of its health spending from April 2016.
Mayoral candidate Mr Khan said while he supported giving London more power over health services, the city could not afford to wait as long as Manchester, which was promised control "years ago".
He said: "We must ensure that the fine print of any devolution proposal works for London, and that the proper management and financial structures are in place."
