A mother abducted her son's ex-girlfriend after breaking into her house with an accomplice, a court heard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Roseann Browne and Stacey Duff went to the woman's Dundee home looking for Browne's son.
Dundee Sheriff Court was told she was bundled into a car after the pair threatened her.
Police were alerted and apprehended the women before the car could be driven away.
The victim had managed to dial 999 as the two women broke into her flat but then her phone was taken from her.
Depute fiscal Saima Rasheed told the court: "Neighbours could see and it was clear she did not want to go with them.
"She was put in the middle seat in the back of the car and all the other seats were occupied by the two accused and two males.
"Police asked for the complainer to get out of the car and when she did,  she told them to 'get me away from them'.
"Officers entered the building and could see the mortice lock on the door was damaged and found the mobile phone smashed inside on the floor."
Browne, 41, of Cupar, and Duff, 30, of Kirkcaldy, pleaded guilty to a charge of abduction committed on 29 July this year in Dundee.
Not guilty pleas from two male co-accused were accepted by the Crown.
Sheriff Alastair Carmichael deferred sentence until January for social work background reports and released the two women on bail.
