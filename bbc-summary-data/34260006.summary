[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
High street sales in Scotland were "weak on all fronts" last month, according to a new report.

The SRC-KPMG Scottish Retail Sales Monitor said sales were 2.4% down on a year ago, when they were boosted by major events such as the end of the Commonwealth Games.
Total food sales improved on July's figures, but were 3% down on the same period last year.
Non-food sales were 1.9% lower than in August 2014.
When adjusted for deflation measured by the BRC-Nielsen Shop Price Index (SPI), total Scottish sales decreased by 1.1%.
David Martin, head of policy and social affairs at the Scottish Retail Consortium (SRC), said: "Despite an uptick in consumer confidence, August sales performance pales in comparison to the like-for-like performance a year earlier when major events, like the finale to the Commonwealth Games, helped to drive footfall.
"Although retailers had a tougher time during August getting consumers to spend, the three-month rolling average for total sales was the best recorded since May and suggests a general improvement across the longer-term.
"Nevertheless, the trading environment remains incredibly challenging for retailers, especially for those selling food."
David McCorquodale, head of retail at KPMG, said: "High street sales in Scotland were weak on all fronts during August, with very little glimmer amidst the gloom.
"The usual culprit to blame for poor sales - the weather - was not at fault this month as both temperatures and sunshine hours were at or above average for the month."
