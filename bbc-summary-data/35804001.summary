[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Humberside Police were called to a disturbance involving a number of people in Cholmley Street shortly before 18:30 GMT on Sunday.
Officers later arrested a 19-year-old man and a second man in the house went on to the roof to avoid being arrested.
According to the Hull Daily Mail, the man on the roof has asked for "a helicopter and a packet of digestives".
A cordon has been put in place around the house and fire and ambulance crews are in attendance.
A police negotiator is trying to talk the man down.
Police said the incident was linked to an assault which "resulted in a 33-year-old man sustaining serious head injuries".
The victim of the assault was taken to Hull Royal Infirmary where he remains in a serious condition.
Two other men, aged 19 and 18, have been arrested on suspicion of assault and remain in custody along with the arrested man.
