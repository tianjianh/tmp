A firm run by award-winning architect Lord Norman Foster has been chosen to design a new bridge in Ipswich.

Five "internationally renowned teams" entered a competition to be part of the project, Suffolk County Council said.
The winner, Foster + Partners, has worked in Ipswich before, creating the Willis Building in the town centre.
Ipswich MP Ben Gummer said the new Upper Orwell crossing was "one of the most important moments for Ipswich for many decades".
"It is difficult to overstate the importance both of what the bridge will do and also what it represents," he said.
"The fact that we will have what will be a globally recognised bridge of beauty will say something powerful about our town's ambition and our place not just in our county, or our region, or our country, but in the world."
Foster + Partners said Ipswich held a "special place" in the firm's heart as the Willis Building was a "landmark project for the practice".
