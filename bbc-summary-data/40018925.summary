[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Greg Eden kept up his phenomenal scoring record for Super League leaders Castleford with a fourth hat-trick in a row to help beat Leigh.

Two Jesse Sene-Lefao tries got the Tigers on the way after Leigh had one of three scores ruled out by the video referee, before Eden cut loose.
All four of his tries were created by the potent left-side combination of Luke Gale and Michael Shenton.
Jake Webster added a seventh Tigers try, their 101st league score of 2017.
Since these two teams met on the opening weekend of the season, Daryl Powell's Castleford have proved to be the stand-out team in the division, and showed hallmarks of that quality to dispatch the Centurions - who have struggled since a bright start.
Leigh were not disgraced by their performance and had plenty of ball but defence has been a major improvement for the Tigers, who have the best record in the division.
Discipline did not help them, as Cas loanee Ben Crooks went to the sin-bin for a dangerous tackle call and the Tigers scored in his absence.
However, it is Castleford's attacking menace which has caught the eye most and they were at their best, through the influential England half-back Gale in particular.
Sene-Lefao took his personal tally to six for the season but Eden is now just 14 tries behind last season's Super League record-breaking winger Denny Solomona with 14 games of the season left to play.
Castleford coach Daryl Powell: "I thought we were superb in the second 20 minutes of the first half. We defended well all the way through but made too many errors when we got in attacking positions early on.
"To nil a team is very difficult to do and we showed some last-ditch stuff there which shows the character in the team. We have done that twice now this season and they are big results for us.
"I thought our attitude was outstanding, given we've just had the second ridiculous short turnaround this season. It's crazy how that has been put together.
"The boys have put a lot of emphasis on defence this year and they were delighted to keep a clean sheet."
