Duffy, 22, has been on loan at Scottish Premiership side Dundee this season after a previous loan spell at Alloa during his two-year Celtic stint.
"I enjoyed my two years in Scotland. I played in some big games and made a good lot of friends," Duffy told the Dundalk FC website.
"It just didn't work out the way I wanted it to but I still enjoyed it. I'm now buzzing to join Dundalk."
Duffy - who played with Dundalk midfielder Patrick McEleney at Derry - was last year called up to the Northern Ireland senior squad by Michael O'Neill.
The winger has played for the Northern Ireland Under-21s.
