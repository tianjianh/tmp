MP quits Labour team over leader's office 'lies'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Shadow foreign office minister Stephen Doughty has resigned from the front bench accusing the Labour leader's office of telling "lies" about the shadow cabinet reshuffle.

The Cardiff South and Penarth MP quit after Jeremy Corbyn sacked the party's Europe spokesman Pat McFadden.
Mr Doughty said his colleague was dismissed for his views on Islamic extremism and the Paris terror attacks.
He said national security should transcend "personal score-settling".
Announcing his resignation live on the BBC's Daily Politics programme, Mr Doughty said: "Fundamentally I agree with everything Pat McFadden said about terrorism, national security and about not being seen to develop a narrative that this is somehow the West that's responsible.
"And I have to look at my own conscience in that situation.
"And when an individual has been singled out for a sacking for words that I completely agree with I think it's only the honourable thing for me to do to also tender my resignation."
Mr Doughty also said "lies" were coming from the leader's office about the reasons behind the sacking of Mr McFadden.
Mr Corbyn's close ally, shadow chancellor John McDonnell, has said the sacking was due to "issues about loyalty".
"I think things are being said, that are simply not true," Mr Doughty said.
"One of the reasons I agreed to serve under Jeremy was his comments about 'new politics', about being open, being transparent, about being honest, about being straight-talking and certainly that seemed to be the case for the first weeks and months of his leadership.
"But unfortunately there is a tendency amongst those around him and in his team to be conducting some pretty unpleasant operations against people who've loyally served the party in government and in opposition".
Mr Doughty's resignation sparked a war of words on twitter, with his fellow Welsh Labour MP Paul Flynn.
Newport West MP Mr Flynn tweeted (but later deleted): "Steve 'who?' Doughty resigns as part of Revolt of Unreformed Blairites uses wild divisive language. One Leader. One Party. One Enemy."
He added: "Corbyn-Victory deniers in uber rant. Poor losers in denial on JC's victory. Celebrate departure of lightweights. Better replacements coming."
Mr Doughty responded: "You've known me since I was 10 years old Paul ;) let alone that I am next door constituency to you.
"And you know full well I am hardly a lightweight..."
Earlier, Labour Aberavon MP Stephen Kinnock said the party was "going into uncharted territory" following the reshuffle.
Allies of Mr Corbyn have defended his right to make changes, saying the shadow cabinet had been out of line with the party as a whole on issues such as Syria.
