[SN]TITLE[SN]
Grimsby Town 0-1 Derby County

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Derby County defeated 10-man Grimsby Town to secure a second-round tie against Barnsley in the EFL Cup.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Matej Vydra secured progression for Derby, who had been leading the original tie 1-0 when it was abandoned after 19 minutes because of heavy rain.
The Rams striker sent a penalty past goalkeeper James McKeown after he had been fouled by Nathan Clarke.
Grimsby's Ben Davies was sent off for a second yellow card and Derby saw the game out, despite missing chances.
It was far from one-way traffic in the first half as Paul Dixon and James Berrett had opportunities for League Two Grimsby.
But Clarke's clumsy challenge on Vydra gifted the Championship side the lead before former Rams defender Davies was dismissed for a second bookable offence.
Tom Lawrence then sliced wide for the visitors when presented with an excellent chance, and substitute Ikechi Anya also passed up a good opportunity to make it 2-0.
Match ends, Grimsby Town 0, Derby County 1.
