Blackburn Rovers 2-2 Burton Albion

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Tom Naylor's late header secured Burton a first away point in the Championship to leave Owen Coyle still searching for a first league win as Blackburn boss.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
On-loan Sam Gallagher looked to have won it on his first start for Rovers, heading in Craig Conway's corner.
But Naylor met Matty Palmer's left-wing corner to seal a dramatic point.
Conway had put Rovers ahead in the first half with a 25-yard drive that flew in off the bar, but Burton levelled with Jackson Irvine's header.
A first-ever meeting between the two sides saw Rovers teenage academy product Scott Wharton handed a debut and he made an important early intervention to deflect John Mousinho's header wide.
But after Conway took a Danny Graham pass to rifle in the 12th goal of his Rovers career, Burton, who did not include new loan signing John Brayford in their squad, were level just before the break as Mousinho's right-wing cross was met by an unmarked Irvine.
Rovers started the second half brightly, only for Hope Akpan to head over a Conway free-kick, before Albion were unlucky when Naylor's long range drive crashed against the crossbar.
Gallagher, on loan from Southampton, nodded in at the near post to put Rovers back in front, but Naylor was not to be denied to heap more pressure on Coyle, whose side are bottom of the Championship and the only club in the division still without a league win.
Blackburn manager Owen Coyle: "Having got ourselves ahead twice in the game, we could have seen it out and got the three points we were worthy of.
"We all know it can be a cruel game but, having said that, there were a lot of positives we can take from the game - not least the performance of young Scott Wharton at the back on his debut."
Rovers striker Sam Gallagher: "I was on the highest high from scoring my goal and then gutted when they got the equaliser.
"I felt we deserved more, but at least we showed more character than in our other three games and we are off the mark."
Burton manager Nigel Clough: "As pleasing as it is to get an 88th-minute equaliser, we are disappointed not to have won the game.
"We looked a real threat from set-plays and we deserved at least a point."
