The winner of the prestigious award has been selected from a list of 376 candidates - 228 are individuals and 148 are organisations.
However, who or what they are is meant to be kept closely guarded secret.
Despite this, a list of front-runners has emerged - including Syria's White Helmets, and the negotiators of the Iran nuclear deal.
A number of less obvious suggestions to win the prize have also been rumoured, including Donald Trump for his "vigorous peace through strength ideology".
Syria's White Helmets, volunteers who pull victims from bombed buildings in the war-torn country, appear to be the public's favourite choice. A petition backing them for the prize has more than 304,000 signatures.
But the committee is known for defying expectations.
Last year, the prize went to the Tunisian National Dialogue Quartet, a group lauded for helping their country's transition to democracy, instead of Angela Merkel - who was widely thought to be in the running for her work with refugees.
