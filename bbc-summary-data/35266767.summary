Pet owners in a West Midlands town have said they believe "a cat-killer is in their midst" after 20 died or disappeared in the past 18 months.

Some of the Cradley Heath felines died after being poisoned with anti-freeze and a local charity has said such abuse "is on the increase".
Residents have reported the issue to police and have now clubbed together to hire a pet detective.
Many owners said they will not allow their pets outside.
Kate Antill said she has lost seven cats - three were poisoned and four are "missing, presumed dead".
"It's very upsetting for my children, who don't understand why people would hurt their cats. It just means we won't be having any more cats in the household.
"The police did help in the beginning, but obviously it isn't a priority for them," Ms Antill said.
Angela Gelencser from the charity Wild Acre Rescue, which re-homes cats, said she believed some people become annoyed about cats going into their gardens so deliberately leave anti-freeze out for them to drink.
