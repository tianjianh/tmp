[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The man was extricated from mud at Charmouth by coastguard crews after an alert by a member of the public shortly after 11:00 GMT.
He was treated at the scene for the effects of cold after the three hour ordeal.
Police said he was the second person rescued within the past week and warned fossil hunters there was a "real risk of death or injury" from landslips.
