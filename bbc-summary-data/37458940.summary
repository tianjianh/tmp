[SN]TITLE[SN]
Shrewsbury Town 1-1 Swindon Town

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Shrewsbury drew a third successive game 1-1 after coming from behind to pick up a point against Swindon.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
John Goddard headed Swindon into an early lead before Newcastle United loanee Ivan Toney equalised for Micky Mellon's men on the stroke of half-time.
Swindon started brightly and moved in front in the ninth minute when Goddard nodded in an inviting right-wing cross from Darnell Furlong for his first goal for the club.
Shrewsbury could have equalised shortly afterwards but Jim O'Brien headed a cross from Toney over the bar.
Swindon continued to look dangerous and Nathan Thompson and Yaser Kasim both fired off target from outside the penalty area before Shrewsbury equalised in the 44th minute.
Louis Dodds played a fine through ball which Toney knocked past goalkeeper Lawrence Vigouroux before finding the net.
Olly Lancashire forced a save from Vigouroux early in the second half and then the Swindon goalkeeper made an excellent stop with his foot from substitute AJ Leitch-Smith five minutes from time.
Luke Norris fired over for Swindon and Jon Obika had a shot saved by Jayson Leutwiler before Shrewsbury were reduced to 10 men after Gary Deegan was sent off in the 88th minute for a challenge on Norris, a second yellow card for the midfielder.
