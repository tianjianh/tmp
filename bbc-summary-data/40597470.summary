Olsson, who lost to Reid in the final of last year's inaugural event, proved too strong for the Briton, prevailing 6-2 6-3 to reach the semi-finals.
The Scot, who won singles gold at the Rio Paralympics, will compete in the doubles with England's Alfie Hewett.
Hewett beat France's Nicolas Peifer 4-6 6-2 6-2 in his singles opener.
The 19-year-old will play Argentina's Gustavo Fernandez, who he beat to win his first Grand Slam title at the French Open last month, in the semi-final.
However fellow Britons Lucy Shuker and Jordanne Whiley were beaten by Japanese second seed Yui Kamiji and Dutchwomen Diede De Groot respectively in the women's draw.
