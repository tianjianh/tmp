[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man has been convicted of murdering his wife in a jealous rage a day after he found out about an alleged affair.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Stuart Gallear, 51, admitted fatally stabbing his wife Mandy, 42, at their home in Hindley, Wigan in October 2016.
He claimed he did not intend to kill her and lost his self-control after learning the identity of her lover, joiner Mark Prescott.
A jury at Manchester Crown Court rejected his account and unanimously found him guilty of murder.
Police found Mrs Gallear motionless on the kitchen floor of their home in Makinson Avenue with three deep wounds to her chest on 6 October.
A post-mortem examination revealed one of the stab wounds was 19cm deep and cut through the breast bone.
Gallear had found out his wife was having an affair with Mr Prescott the previous day, when the son of Mr Prescott's partner called at his house, jurors heard.
He sent text messages to Mr Prescott, one of which said "big mistake", and the next day threatened to kill him over the phone.
Six months earlier, Mrs Gallear had confessed to her husband, a warehouse manager, about an extra-marital relationship, but denied it was with Mr Prescott and said it had ended.
Gallear, who is originally from Wolverhampton, told police he remembered talking "amicably" with his wife on the afternoon of the attack after he returned from drinking five pints of lager in a local pub.
He said she then told him "I love him more than you" but his memory of what happened next was "blurred".
He claimed he "just snapped out of it", put the knife aside and rang for assistance after his wife protested "what are you doing? I still love you".
Prosecutor Alaric Bassao accused him of having "selective memory loss" and said the stabbing was the culmination of his anger and resentment.
Gallear is due to be sentenced on 12 April.
