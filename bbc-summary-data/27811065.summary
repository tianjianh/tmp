They include schemes to revamp Newport and Bridgend centres, move people back into empty homes in Port Talbot and make properties in Pontypridd energy efficient.
Vacant flats above shops in Swansea will also be converted into homes and derelict sites in Merthyr Tydfil will be built on.
Schemes totalling £36m for north Wales were announced by ministers last week.
The funding is from the Welsh government's Vibrant and Viable Places initiative.
Housing and Regeneration Minister Carl Sargeant said he was "delighted" with the range of projects being supported.
"There are several excellent projects targeted at renovating empty properties, derelict buildings and empty shops, attracting more people to live in town centres and making the necessary improvements to existing housing stock," he said.
"I've also approved significant funding for a wide range of different projects, from a state of the art business facility in Pontypridd to an integrated transport hub in Port Talbot.
"Facilities like these, in conjunction with the new homes, will create jobs, improve links and breathe new life into town centre centres."
