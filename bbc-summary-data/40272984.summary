A huge fire has engulfed a tower block in west London, having broken out in the early hours of Wednesday, leaving several people dead.
The blaze ripped through the 24-storey Grenfell Tower in Latimer Road, trapping residents inside as 200 firefighters fought the blaze. Emergency services attempted to evacuate the concrete block and said at least 50 people are being treated in hospital.
The fire gutted the building, with flames soaring from the second floor to the top of the building. Witnesses reported hearing screams from people inside. Police have said people are being treated for "a range of injuries".
According to witnesses, the fire appeared to take hold of the building in one corner before engulfing the tower block. The building, in North Kensington, was built in 1974 and contains 120 homes; about 500 people live in the flats. It is reported the fire began on the fourth floor.
One resident, pictured below left, was trapped in his 11th floor flat. Pictured right, he's been rescued by firefighters.
Those living in sight of the scene awoke to find smoke pouring from the tower as firefighters continued to pour water on the blackened building. Resident Chloe Busby said she could "still see flames" at 08:00 BST. Questions have begun to arise about what caused the fire and why it spread so rapidly.
Another resident told the BBC fire alarms "did not go off". London fire brigade say they currently have no indication of what caused the fire.
Witnesses have described screams of terror and people jumping in a bid to reach safety after the blaze ripped through Grenfell Tower.  One evacuated resident, Tamara, told the BBC, "People were just throwing their kids our saying, 'Just save my children, just save my children.'"
Local resident Tim Downie described the scene as "horrendous". "The whole building is engulfed in flames... It's the most terrifying thing I've ever seen. I just hope they have got everyone out."
Mickey Paramasivan (above, with daughter Thea Kavanagh), a resident of Grenfell Tower, had to put her under his dressing gown and rush out of his flat to escape the fire.
The BBC's Andy Moore said the whole block had been alight and there were fears the building might collapse.
Eyewitnesses said they saw lights - thought to be mobile phones or torches - flashing at the top of the block of flats, and trapped residents coming to their windows - some holding children.
London mayor Sadiq Khan said the first fire engine was at the tower block within six minutes and describes the London Fire Brigade as the "best fire service in the world".
The BBC's Wyre Davis, at the scene, reports that the fire has taken hold again "with a vengeance right in the middle of the tower block".
He says it's a spot where the firefighters can't easily focus their hoses. Debris continues to fall and black smoke is once again billowing out of Grenfell Tower.
Stories are emerging of individuals who helped save those trapped in the tower - including one member of the public who caught a baby thrown from the ninth or 10th floor.
Witness Samira Lamrani told the Press Association: "People were starting to appear at the windows, frantically banging and screaming.
"The windows were slightly ajar, a woman was gesturing that she was about to throw her baby and if somebody could catch her baby.
"Somebody did, a gentleman ran forward and managed to grab the baby."
Offers of help have been made by members of the public and local community centres.
Bunches of flowers have started being left near the fire. One has a card with it which reads: "Love and prayers to the victims and their families. Justice has to be done. People before money. RIP."
Members of the public have gathered in the nearby area, bringing clothes for all sizes and ages of people as well as food and drink.
Prime Minister Theresa May has said she is "deeply saddened by the tragic loss of life".
Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn described the blaze as the "worst nightmare anyone could think of."
