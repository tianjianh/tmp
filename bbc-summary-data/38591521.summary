[SN]TITLE[SN]
Bradford forced to cancel Batley Bulldogs pre-season game

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A proposed pre-season friendly for a Bradford Select XIII due to take place on Sunday has been called off because they do not have enough players.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
They were supposed to face Batley Bulldogs, who were reportedly planning to donate a share of the proceeds to Bradford's players and staff.
Bradford Bulls were liquidated on 3 January, and the Rugby Football League is considering bids to form a new club.
Several Bradford players have since joined other teams as free agents.
Should a new Bradford side be formed, it would compete in the second-tier Championship, which starts a new season on the opening weekend of February.
It would begin the season with a 12-point deficit and be awarded the lowest funding of all Championship clubs from the RFL, receiving just Â£150,000.
