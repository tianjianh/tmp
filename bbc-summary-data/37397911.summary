Eddie Jones: RFU should pay to develop young coaches in Super Rugby

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
England boss Eddie Jones has called on the Rugby Football Union (RFU) to develop English coaches by paying for them to work in Super Rugby.

The Australian says England can learn from New Zealand, who have won back-to-back World Cups under former Wales bosses Graham Henry and Steve Hansen.
"English coaches need to get that other bit of the game which is there in the southern hemisphere," he told PA Sport.
"It would cost money, but the RFU could do it," added Jones.
Jones has said that New Zealand "control the world" and "every bit of rugby", partly because of their success at sending up-and-coming coaches to Europe to provide them with a different perspective on the game.
The former Japan and Australia boss believes England would profit from a similar approach, but says the RFU would need to be willing to invest.
"The only way a Super Rugby side is going to take them is [for the RFU] to pay for their salary," he explained.
"Steve Hansen and Graham Henry had stints in Wales where they rounded off their coaching experience, and it's no coincidence that New Zealand have become a better all-round team because of that.
"They take the good parts of the game up here - the expertise in the set-piece - and take it back to the southern hemisphere."
Super Rugby is the leading club rugby union competition in the southern hemisphere, with teams from Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, Japan and Argentina taking part.
