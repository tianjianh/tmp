She was reacting to concerns from the watchdog - the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority - about the way some Assembly Members have been overturning refusals of their expenses claims.
The body which runs Stormont, the Assembly Commission, is to meet on Wednesday to discuss the issue.
BBC News NI's political correspondent Gareth Gordon reports.
