For the third year running, the charity is asking women to raise money by swapping their make-up for a paw print.
Renowned photographer Rankin has taken photos of eight celebrities, who also include singer and former Strictly Come Dancing contestant Sophie Ellis-Bextor.
She said: "I'm delighted to be joining the campaign alongside so many phenomenal women."
Beauty vlogger Tanya Burr, Bafta-winning actress Olivia Colman, TV presenter Lorraine Kelly, Rochelle Hume from The Saturdays and actress Michelle Keegan complete this year's famous line-up.
But for the first time since the campaign began, the stars are also joined by women who work alongside BBC Children in Need - which helps disadvantaged children and young people across the UK.
The charity is asking for women to post their own photos on the Children in Need website and be a part of the Big BearFaced Selfie.
