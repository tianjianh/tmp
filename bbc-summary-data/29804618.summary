The uniform code has been drawn up by chief officers to clarify standards required for dress and appearance.
However religious and cultural requirements would be accommodated as far as possible, the force said.
Chief Constable Simon Prince said: "Public confidence in the officers and staff of Dyfed-Powys Police will be enhanced by presenting a smart and professional image.
"The wearing of uniform to a consistently high standard across the force area portrays a confident and credible image to the public and the communities that we serve."
Mr Salmon added: "Uniforms give confidence and self-respect. This policy will help give the public officers who engender that confidence, credibility and respect."
