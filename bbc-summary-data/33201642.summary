GoGoDragons! Norwich sculpture trail opens

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Dragons are taking over the centre of Norwich for the next two months as a new sculpture trail opens in the city.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 84 models form a community art trail called GoGoDragons!
The 5ft (1.6m) high glass-fibre creatures were created by Wild in Art and the trail is organised by Break, a Norfolk charity caring for vulnerable people.
The trail is open from Sunday until 5 September and the dragons will eventually be auctioned for charity.
The event follows on from 2013's GoGoGorillas! trail, which raised about Â£270,000 for charity at auction.
The choice of dragons for the latest event draws on the close association between the heraldic symbol and the city since the Middle Ages.
The creatures feature in much of Norwich's architecture and the city has churches dedicated to Saint George in Tombland and Colegate - both of which house dragon symbols.
Artists and community groups submitted designs for the painted dragons on a number of given themes including Norwich and Norfolk, nature and cult.
There are also seven heritage-related dragons with associated activities ranging from calligraphy to puppetry.
Organisers said the trail featuring gorilla sculptures increased footfall and boosted the economy of Norwich.
Trail maps will be available throughout the city.
