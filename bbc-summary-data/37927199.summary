Che Labastide-Wellington, 17, was stabbed in the heart at the 16th birthday party in Kenton, north-west London, on 7 November 2015.
Walker Sesay, 19, of Wembley, north-west London, was found guilty at the Old Bailey of manslaughter.
Three other men, aged between 18 and 23, were found guilty of wounding with intent.
The trial heard a "small army" of men attacked Che and one of his friends, who was also stabbed several times.
The attack was the result of a feud between people on neighbouring north-west London estates, the jury was told.
Prosecuting, Crispin Aylett QC said a flyer for the event was posted on Instagram which meant "inevitably a number of people who had not been invited got to hear about it".
He added: "Once the defendants' group had arrived... they immediately attacked as a group - surrounding Che and his friends.
Mr Labastide-Wellington, who was believed to have been carrying a knife himself, was stabbed once in the chest and collapsed in a nearby alleyway.
Rimmel Williams, 18, of  Willesden, north-west London, Calvin Tudor, 22, of Willesden, and Marlon Tudor, 23, of no fixed address, were found guilty of wounding with intent.
Omar Afrah, 22, and Olamilekan Onafowokan, 23, both of Wembley, were found guilty of conspiracy to commit violent disorder.
They will all be sentenced on 6 December.
Ibrahim Mansaray, 18, of Acton, west London, and a 15-year-old from Willesden, who cannot be named, were acquitted of all charges.
