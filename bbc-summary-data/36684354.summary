County Championship: Alastair Cook makes 49 after Essex dismiss Kent

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
England captain Alastair Cook made 49 after Essex dismissed Kent cheaply on day one of the County Championship Division Two match at Chelmsford.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Cook, in his only Championship match before the first Test against Pakistan, was the second of two wickets to Kagiso Rabada as Essex closed on 107-2.
Essex earlier bowled Kent out for 207, Jamie Porter taking 3-51.
Kent had been reduced to 101-6, but were dragged to respectability by Alex Blake's unbeaten 89.
Blake, with his highest Championship score of the season, shared 56 with wicketkeeper Callum Jackson, making his debut in place of Sam Billings, who is on international duty.
Rabada also supported in a ninth-wicket stand of 37 before the South African, playing his first game of first-class cricket since taking 13 wickets against England in the fourth Test in January.
He then had the final say in a day that otherwise belonged to Essex, first having Nick Browne caught at mid-on, then trapping Cook in front with a yorker from the very last ball of the day.
