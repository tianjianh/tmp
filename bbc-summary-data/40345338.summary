The 25 and 27-year-olds were attacked as they headed home on Castle Brae at about 02:00 on Sunday.
Police have appealed for witnesses to the incident and have been trying to trace two other men.
One was described as being 5ft 11in tall and having dark hair and the other 5ft 9in and light brown hair. Both had stocky builds and aged in their 20s.
The first man was wearing a blue shirt, jeans and Adidas trainers, and the second had on jeans, a red, orange or maroon jacket with a goggles-shaped motif on the hood.
Insp Jamie Wilson, of Police Scotland's Sutherland and Easter Ross community policing team, said: "We are still trying to establish the full facts, but I believe that a number of people would have seen what happened.
"These were particularly nasty assaults and I am appealing for anyone who can assist our investigation to contact us as soon as possible.
"We are especially keen to hear from anyone who may have seen a group of individuals fighting or heard a disturbance."
