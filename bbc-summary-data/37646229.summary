The gorilla has been recaptured.
The zoo earlier told the BBC it was "managing an incident" after reports an animal had escaped.
Visitor Brad Evans said customers had been locked inside the cafe at about 17:10 BST and told by staff a gorilla had escaped from its enclosure.
Police said the incident had now "concluded" amid reports the gorilla was shot with a tranquilliser dart.
