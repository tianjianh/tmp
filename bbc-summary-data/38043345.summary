Residents at a Belfast homeless shelter say they have been living in freezing conditions since the building's heating system broke down on Friday.

Morning Star House caters for up to 39 residents, most of whom have a history of sleeping rough.
Two of those residents contacted the BBC over the weekend to explain the situation.
The first, who asked to remain anonymous, said: "We have no heating - it's been off from yesterday.
"I've been told we have no choice but to live like this until Monday."
As temperatures plummeted to minus figures on Saturday night, the resident was concerned for the health of the sick and elderly who live at the hostel.
"There are over 30 people here, a lot them are elderly. I was freezing cold last night, and I'm worried someone is going to get really sick or even worse. I think I may be safer moving out. I need a roof over my head as weather is so bad I couldn't go back to sleeping on streets."
Another resident claimed that, on Saturday night, about 10 others left the hostel to find warm accommodation elsewhere.
"Some of the older residents are in very poor health already, so I'm worried about them," he said.
He explained that, although staff had brought in four electric heaters for the communal area downstairs, there was no heating in the bedrooms, which he described as being "like ice boxes".
Management of the shelter - which is run by the Legion of Mary Catholic charity - have been asked by the BBC for a statement, but no one was available.
When Sunday News presenter Jayne McCormack arrived at the shelter on Sunday morning, no residents were available to speak to her.
"A manager did come out to talk to me, but he didn't want to be recorded," she said.
"However, he did confirm that, while the hostel's heating system had broken, management had brought in a set of replacement heaters and that they would be getting parts to fix the broken heater on Monday. They said they'd received no complaints from any residents about the temperature."
Residents who contacted the BBC disputed the suggestion that no complaints had been made.
Morning Star House is a homeless shelter for men that was was opened in 1938 by a civil servant called Frank Duff and volunteers from Saint Vincent De Paul, but in later years it became a Legion of Mary hostel run by its volunteers.
On its facebook site, the charity says "the development of the spiritual dimension of the person is fundamental to the outlook of the Legion of Mary and is a vital ingredient in the recovery of those with problems of addiction".
