The 22-year-old Colombian was caught behind his rivals in the closing stages in Tortona but surged up the barriers on the inside to take victory.
Bernard Hinault, a 10-time Grand Tour winner, won five stages on his debut at the 1978 Vuelta a Espana.
Tom Dumoulin still leads the Giro.
The Dutch Sunweb rider finished safely in the peloton to maintain his advantage of two minutes 23 seconds over Colombia's Nairo Quintana (Movistar).
Orica's Adam Yates is the highest-placed Briton in 15th, six minutes 52 seconds behind Dumoulin, after Team Sky's Geraint Thomas pulled out earlier on Friday because of injury.
Quick-Step Floors' Gaviria also won stages three, five and 12, but this was his most impressive win, having been forced to swerve around team-mate Maximiliano Richeze in the final 300m to overhaul Sam Bennett (Bora), who finished second, with Trek's Jasper Stuyven in third.
The focus returns to the general classification on Saturday, with a 131km stage starting in Castellania and ending in a summit finish in Santuario di Oropa.
