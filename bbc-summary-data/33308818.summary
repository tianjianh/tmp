A type of rose thought to be extinct in the UK has been discovered growing in a garden hedge in Gloucestershire.

The 'City of Gloucester Rose' was created for the city by John Sanday in 1969, but has not been on sale since 1995 and was thought to have been lost.
But following months of searching, the peach-coloured rose has been found in a garden in Abbeydale near Gloucester.
A spokeswoman for Plant Heritage, said: "It hasn't been seen for 20 years this may well be the last one growing."
A search for a "living plant" was launched by Caroline Mellor, from the Gloucester Local History Society.
Following months of intensive research, it was finally discovered in a garden in Abbeydale still bearing a faded label with "City of Gloucester rose" written on it.
"When I began, nobody seemed to have heard of the rose," she said.
"So to actually see it at last - having been searching for it and asking so many people about this rose - is amazing."
According to the garden plant conservation charity Plant Heritage, the hybrid tea rose was on the organisation's "threatened" list but with no records of a living plant for two decades was set to be described as critical or extinct.
"It's been out of cultivation for 20 years," said a spokeswoman.
"So it's very lucky to have found it."
