Large fibreglass models of toads have returned to Hull, five years after the original art project.

The toads commemorated the 25th anniversary of the death of Hull-based poet Philip Larkin.
They were devised in honour of the poems Toads and Toads Revisited by Larkin, who completed many of his prolific works in the city.
The weekend's Toads Revisited trail has many of the original models on display in the city centre and private houses.
Planned events include flying a 25ft (8m) inflatable toad above the city.
Rick Welton, project director of Toads Revisited said: "The original Larkin with Toads project was a huge success that really captured people's imaginations locally and gained national recognition."
The original 10-week display generated more than Â£1m for Hull, according to a report.
An assessment of the scheme, commissioned by the project's organisers, said that 120,000 visitors came to Hull to follow the trail.
The tourists generated Â£500,000 of extra income for the city's retailers.
The scheme attracted controversy when it was first announced and in 2010 Hull City Council withdrew funding after negative publicity.
