Reaction as NI leader Peter Robinson steps aside in Stormont crisis

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Political leaders have been reacting to the decision by Northern Ireland First Minister Peter Robinson to step aside in a deepening crisis at Stormont.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Arlene Foster has taken over as acting first minister and three other DUP ministers resigned after the party's bid to adjourn the assembly failed.
The crisis was sparked by the murder of ex-IRA man Kevin McGuigan, last month.
The British and Irish governments expressed concern over the DUP's actions and called for further talks.
"I am gravely concerned about the situation in Northern Ireland.
"The government objective is clear: we want to work with political leaders for a Northern Ireland where politics works, the economy grows and which is no longer defined by its divided past but by its shared future.
"The UK government does not believe it would be right to introduce emergency legislation now to suspend the assembly."
"It's a bad day for the Northern Ireland political process.
"But it's worth remembering that there have been a number of such bad days over the 20 years since the leadership of Northern Ireland undertook this great process which led to the Good Friday Agreement and subsequent agreements.
"There is an urgent need to get the parties together, find a way to repair those working relationships and address the two issues."
"Today's events are most regrettable.
"I don't believe the best interest of politics or people is served by such actions. I believe there is time, not very much, to reflect on what happened here.
"What we lack is the political will and leadership to resolve these issues and I believe that over the next four or five weeks they still can be done.
"Today's proceedings don't look good. I am discouraged by most of the ministers resigning. I don't believe the institutions can limp on now indefinitely.
"I would urge everybody to get round the table in Stormont House with myself and representatives of the British government to see if we can chart a way forward.
"Time is not on our side and we don't have too many chances left."
"The United States government strongly supports the cross-party talks led by the UK and Irish governments.
"We again encourage all of Northern Ireland's political parties to engage constructively in these negotiations in order to strengthen the devolved institutions.
"Northern Ireland's achievements are the result of dialogue and responsible leadership; now is the time to re-energise the parties' commitment to implementing the Stormont House Agreement and addressing remnant paramilitary activity.
The United States remains actively engaged and will continue to support political progress."
"I know how difficult it is when you reach a doomsday and you have to start putting it all back together again. It is a very difficult task.
"Every single time that we faced a vacuum, it meant trouble. This will be no exception. There are people there who would only relish that fact, small in number, determined in their project.
"It would be a crying shame to allow us to face that position."
"The Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) have upped the ante today. It is a sham fight between themselves and the Ulster Unionist Party (UUP).
"Peter Robinson has actually not resigned, even though other ministers have. As that stands, it means there will not be an election and I think that was his intention.
"The DUP is afraid of an election."
"This is incredibly weak leadership.
"Instead of the focus remaining firmly on Sinn Féin, people are now trying to determine exactly what this latest example of DUP manoeuvring actually means.
"Given the financial shambles that the DUP and Sinn Féin have presided over, and which has continued at pace under Arlene Foster, it is obvious that she has only been appointed as presiding first minister for no other reason than to allow the DUP to cling on to the reins of power."
"It's extraordinary; it verges on farce. Here you have the first minister stepping aside, he's not resigning. Arlene Foster holds on to the Finance portfolio, but all the other DUP ministers resign and she is in an acting position as the first minister.
"What is the public to make of that? I mean it's pure farce. The public will be very confused about these tactics. Peter Robinson has called this wrong.
"We know the issues, we simply have to apply our minds collectively and show some degree of co-operation. Let us negotiate through this. We don't have to bring down the assembly because there is a political crisis. Why does this place have to come down?
"Devolution is an integral part of reconciliation but for it to function, people need to step back and calm down.
"Alliance has consistently said cool heads and strong leadership is needed, which is what we are providing.
"However, today's events show others are not as interested and would rather grandstand and threaten power-sharing for short-term gain."
"The parties have to be willing to compromise and commit to begin rebuilding the trust which has all but disappeared.
"For all those who have sacrificed so much for peace and stability in Northern Ireland the stakes couldn't be higher.
"It is time to choose between political strife and division or a renewed commitment to building a better future."
