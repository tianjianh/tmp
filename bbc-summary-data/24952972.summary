A non-league football club which went bust six years ago has outlined plans for a stadium development worth £100m.

Boston United, from Lincolnshire, went into administration in 2007 with huge debts and were relegated to the Conference North as a result.
Club chairman David Newton, who owns Chestnut Homes, said the development was 12 years in the planning.
It will include 500 new houses, shops and restaurants in the first stage of the project called The Quadrant.
The plans involve moving out of the stadium in York Road, where the club has been based since the late 19th century, and moving to a new 4,000-seater ground off the A16 at Tytton Lane.
"There is a lot of funding to be found," Mr Newton said.
"We've got to work with our funders, with the borough and county councils. At the moment we've a bid through the greater Lincolnshire Enterprise Partnership for £2.5m."
The ambitious plans were announced at a packed meeting with supporters on Thursday evening and were met with gasps of amazement.
So far, fans have been broadly supportive of the proposals which will see about 450 jobs created.
Mr Newton said much of the funding is likely to come in the form of loans from local and central government to be paid back over the course of the development.
The club is now running a public consultation until 31 December and then hopes to submit planning permission in February next year with hopes to start work by 2015.
