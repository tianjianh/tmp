Una Crown, who was last seen alive on Friday, was found at her home in Magazine Lane, Wisbech, on Sunday.
A man delivering newspapers discovered the knife in a street close to Magazine Lane on Friday morning, police said.
It is being examined to see if it is linked to the murder. Police believe Mrs Crown, a widow, was set alight in an attempt to destroy evidence.
Det Ch Insp Jon Hutchinson said: "It is still very early and we are keeping an open mind as to the relevance of this discovery.
"We are continuing with searches of the area around Magazine Lane and house-to-house inquiries are ongoing."
Officers will be stopping motorists, cyclists and walkers in the area over the weekend asking people whether they remember seeing anything suspicious last weekend.
A post-mortem examination found Mrs Crown died of stab wounds to her neck and chest.
She was last seen on Friday, but spoke to a friend by telephone at about 17:00 GMT on Saturday.
The body of Mrs Crown was found at 10:45 GMT on Sunday. Her clothes had been set alight but the fire did not spread to the rest of the bungalow.
Det Ch Insp Jon Hutchinson said: "This was a horrific murder of a defenceless elderly woman in her own home.
"The fire damage meant it was difficult to initially establish the cause of Mrs Crown's death."
Police have narrowed down the time of the attack to Saturday night or Sunday morning, as Mrs Crown had spoken to a friend by telephone at about 17:00 GMT on Saturday.
