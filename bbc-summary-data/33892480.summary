[SN]TITLE[SN]
Washed up Cefn Sidan sea buoy serves up barnacle delicacy

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A buoy carrying thousands of expensive and rare barnacles considered a delicacy in Spain has washed up on a Carmarthenshire beach.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The gooseneck barnacles were attached to the 16ft (5m) steel shipping ball that came ashore on Cefn Sidan beach.
Diners can pay hundreds of pounds for a plateful of the crustaceans, also known as Percebes.
The warning device was recovered after it became detached from its anchor at sea.
The council's countryside and parks manager, Rory Dickinson, said: "It is said that goose barnacles taste intensely of the sea and are known as the fortune on the rocks in Spain's 'cliffs of death'.
"Unfortunately we didn't get the chance to check this out as they were already dead by the time they reached us."
