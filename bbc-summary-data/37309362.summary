[SN]TITLE[SN]
A Victorian guide to Cambridge student life

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Undergraduates were encouraged to smoke but told not to use tea cosies in a Victorian guide to student life.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Fresher's Don't was published in 1893 for Cambridge University students.
It is on display at an exhibition at St John's College, which was then an all-male establishment.
The guide includes advice on the opposite sex, including "not to get too familiar" with the landlady's daughter - and a reminder not to "speak to girls without introduction".
