Ottawa Mayor Jim Watson was among those who came to pay last tributes to Abdirahman Abdi at a city mosque.
Mr Abdi, 37, a Somali immigrant, died on Monday, a day after being arrested for allegedly fondling a woman.
A video has emerged showing him bleeding and handcuffed during the arrest. The case is being investigated.
In a statement, Mr Abdi's family said he was a "wonderful son, amazing brother and kind-hearted uncle".
The family said that "what happened to him that Sunday wasn't fair at all and shouldn't be justified by any means" and "we all have many questions".
He arrived in Canada in 2009, according to his brother Abdiaziz.
The circumstances of Mr Abdi's death are now being investigated by Ontario's Special Investigation Unit.
The case has sparked a debate about race relations in Canada - a nation that is widely seen as being tolerant.
Ottawa's police chief Charles Bordeleau said on Friday that there had been "a number of incidents" involving his officers, including taunts, since the death of Mr Abdi.
