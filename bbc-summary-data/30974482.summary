A Liberal Democrat parliamentary candidate has defended accepting money from a peer who left the party after plotting against its leader Nick Clegg.

Lord Oakeshott has donated Â£600,000 to Lib Dem, Labour and Green candidates in an attempt to prevent a Conservative win in May's General Election.
He quit facing disciplinary action for commissioning research suggesting the party would do better without Mr Clegg.
Berwick candidate Julie Porksen said his donation was just one of many.
"I've received support from people from across the political spectrum and those who have no political allegiance at all," she told the BBC's Sunday Politics.
Lord Oakeshott's aim for a Labour-Lib Dem coalition headed by Ed Miliband were "his views", she said.
In an interview with the Financial Times, the former peer said: "I've taken a leave of absence from the Lords and am just a non-party social democrat now but I want to help save our country from a Tory government cringing to UKIP."
