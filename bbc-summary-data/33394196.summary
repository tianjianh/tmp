A Damien Hirst sculpture which highlights an "outdated vision of disability" has been installed in London as part of a new exhibition.

The 7m sculpture, called Charity, is based on a Scope collection box from the 1960s of a disabled young girl holding a teddy bear.
It was installed opposite the capital's Gherkin building as part of the 2015 Sculpture in the City exhibition.
Other sculptures are being unveiled near London landmarks.
The open air exhibition, which is in its fifth year, shows off a selection of contemporary art pieces in and around the Square Mile.
The charity Scope, which aims to improve the lives of disabled people in the UK, withdrew the collection boxes in the 1980s in favour of promoting positive images of disabled people.
But Hirst's sculpture shows a scuffed version where the girl's collection box has been broken into with a crow bar which lies at her feet.
It is intended to depict the historical tradition of representing charity and disability as a pitiful image.
Alan Gosschalk, fundraising director at Scope, says: "Charity is an iconic piece of art. It is also a symbol of changing attitudes to disability over the past 50 years, since collection boxes like the one depicted in this sculpture were seen on high streets across the country.
"This artwork highlights an outdated vision of charity and disability. However, while attitudes to disabled people have improved in this time, many people still feel awkward about disability.
"We hope that this sculpture will encourage conversations about disability amongst people in our capital."
Hirst made a name for himself in the 1990s with controversial works such as "Mother and Child Divided" - consisting of a cow and a calf dissected into preserved segments - and putting a shark in a tank of formaldehyde.
