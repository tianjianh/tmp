Exeter winger Jack Nowell and Leicester flanker Mike Williams have become the latest players to join a lengthening England injury list.

Nowell, 23, tore a quad muscle at the England camp in Brighton, while Williams suffered nerve damage in his arm warming up for Tigers on Saturday.
England also saw flanker Sam Jones break his leg and winger Anthony Watson break his jaw at the training cap.
Premiership Rugby criticised the timing and intensity of England's sessions.
Nowell - capped 18 times by England - was absent from Exeter's 27-27 draw against Gloucester. and is expected to be "out for weeks" according to Exeter director of rugby Rob Baxter.
Chiefs boss Baxter revealed he has "significant quad tear" which makes him a doubt for the start of the autumn internationals next month.
Nowell, who featured in all three of England's wins over Australia in June, has already endured an injury-hit season, having only recently returned from a spell on the sidelines with a thumb injury.
Leicester director of rugby Richard Cockerill said he was unsure whether Williams' injury would keep him out of his club's European Champions Cup meeting with Glasgow Warriors next weekend.
"We will have it scanned and see where he's at. Hopefully it's just a bit of nerve irritation," he said.
Williams' injury scare, combined with Jones' absence, potentially leaves England short of open-side flanker options with James Haskell out until early 2017 with a toe injury and Harlequins' Jack Clifford already ruled out of the autumn internationals as he has had ankle surgery.
