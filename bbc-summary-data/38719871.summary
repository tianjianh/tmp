The seizure was bigger than the total quantity of the drug seized in the Republic in the past two years, according to national broadcaster RTE.
A total of 1,873 kilos of herbal cannabis was discovered concealed in wide-load containers.
They were labelled as containing machinery parts.
The containers arrived on a ship from mainland Europe.
The drugs were vacuum packed and concealed to avoid detection by X-rays and sniffer dogs.
Gardaí (police) said investigations are continuing both locally and internationally.
Garda assistant commissioner John O'Driscoll said: "We are all about trying to achieve results and this, I believe in anyone's estimation, is a great result.
"We are about trying to tackle organised crime in a significant manner. The business of organised crime will be impacted."
He listed a string of recent operations including the seizure of firearms from groups "intent on killing each other" in an apparent reference to recent gangland killings in the city.
Mr O'Driscoll added: "All of these actions together combine to have a significant impact on organised crime."
