The former Netherlands and Manchester United defender, 44, had one year left on his current deal.
Assistant manager Andries Ulderink and first-team coach Said Bakkati have also signed new contracts.
Reading lost on penalties to Huddersfield in the Championship play-off final last season.
"His presence provides consistency at this football club and his leadership is invaluable going into the new Championship season," director of football Brian Tevreden told the club website.
"On a personal note, I enjoy working alongside him and his team, and he fully deserves this new contract."
