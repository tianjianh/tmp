Knockaert's father Patrick died aged 63 last Thursday and the former Leicester player missed Albion's trip to Bristol City in the Championship on Saturday.
Midfielder Steve Sidwell dedicated his goal in the 2-0 win to the Frenchman.
"Coming all the way from England it's just unbelievable. My dad had the best tribute ever," Knockaert, 24, tweeted.
Sidwell was among 10 Brighton players seen alongside Knockaert in pictures posted on Twitter.
Goalkeepers David Stockdale and Niki Maenpaa, defenders Bruno, Gaetan Bong, Lewis Dunk, Connor Goldson and Liam Rosenior, midfielder Dale Stephens and winger Jamie Murphy also made the trip to Leers, on the outskirts of Lille, on Tuesday.
"I will never forget that day! The respect of this football club is too much... You are not just my team mates but my friends forever," Knockaert added on Twitter,
"They give me the power to be where this club has to be. Road to the Premier League... Let's do it for my dad."
