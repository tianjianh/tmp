Michael O'Neill's men had looked like ending a triumphant campaign with a win having led for most of the match through a Craig Cathcart header.
Defender Cathcart, 26, glanced in his first NI goal in the 31st minute after Niall McGinn had clipped in a cross.
Central defender Paulus Arajuuri got Finland's equaliser in the 87th minute.
It was a disappointing end for Northern Ireland, but they have finished top of a qualifying group for the first time, winning six of their 10 games.
They are the first fifth seeds to win a European Championship qualifying group.
The draw in Helsinki capped an unbelievable qualifying campaign.
Having managed a solitary victory in their World Cup 2014 group, Northern Ireland were in pot five when the draw was made in February 2012.
At the time, after discovering NI's Group F opponents, manager Michael O'Neill said: "You could possibly get third place with 14 points, which I think is achievable."
Instead, Northern Ireland have topped a group for the first time, winning three away from home
Before the campaign, NI had won only three away competitive matches in 13 years.
Northern Ireland did not seem to be suffering any ill-effects from the celebrations which followed Thursday's historic win over Greece in Belfast.
Michael O'Neill's men had the better chances in the first period and made the breakthrough just after the half-four mark.
Paddy McNair picked up possession after a fruitless corner and slipped the ball to McGinn in space on the right side of the penalty area.
The Aberdeen winger crossed to the near post and Cathcart, still forward from the set-piece, was there to flash a header across goalkeeper Lukas Hradecky.
Cathcart, deputising for the injured Jonny Evans, was making his 23rd international appearance.
The visitors waned after the interval and Finland had chances to equalise.
They eventually made one count, as Kasper Hamalainen cushioned a lovely header into the path of centre-back Arajuuri who netted a low finish.
It meant an anxious last few minutes for Northern Ireland, but they secured the point to win Group F.
Northern Ireland manager Michael O'Neill: "I think this group of players fully appreciate what they have achieved and go into Euro 2016 to really embrace and enjoy it. However, we also go there with a point to prove and not only be competitive but to excel and take as much from the tournament as we can.
"Of course I'm disappointed not to win the game but we're delighted to top the group and everyone in the dressing room feels exactly the same. We've certainly not got there by any good fortune.
"I genuinely believe we're the best team in the group, the most effective team in the group and we finished as top scorers too. The players deserve enormous credit for that."
