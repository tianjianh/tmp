Oldham, who had last won in the league back on 14 November, went close early on when Matty Palmer fired over.
But, on 23 minutes, Winchester then fired low past Jayson Leutwiler from 20 yards for his first goal of the season.
Shrewsbury's chances were at a premium, James Wallace being denied by Joel Coleman before Ian Black drilled wide.
Oldham had Anthony Gerrard playing at the back after re-signing for the club as a free agent earlier in the day.
The former Walsall, Cardiff City, Huddersfield Town and Shrewsbury centre-half, who had a loan spell with the Latics at the end of last season, has re-signed on a deal until the end of the current campaign.
It meant an instant return to the Meadow for Gerrard, six days after ending his non-contract arrangement with Shrewsbury, where he had been playing for free in an attempt to kick-start his career.
Oldham's first win since the return of manager John Sheridan lifts them a place to 22nd, within seven points of 20th-placed Shrewsbury.
Micky Mellon's men, who won on Saturday at leaders Burton Albion, have not won at home in the league now in three months, having picked up just two points out of a possible 18 at the Greenhous Meadow.
Shrewsbury Town boss Micky Mellon told BBC Radio Shropshire:

"I cannot argue with the stats but it shouldn't be a negative playing at home. It is just about working hard and working smartly. We were not smart tonight and that cost us.
"Maybe a few of the lads are fatigued, I don't know, but I am as baffled as anyone else. It is difficult to explain why we played as we did.
"Oldham outran us all over the pitch. We didn't keep the ball well enough. It is hard to know why after Saturday this happens. I cannot explain it."
