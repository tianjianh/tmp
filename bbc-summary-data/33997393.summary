Israel without injured striker Omer Damari for Euro qualifier in Wales

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Wales' Euro 2016 rivals Israel will be without star striker Omer Damari for their Group B qualifier on 6 September.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 26-year-old Red Bull Salzburg player has been ruled out of the trip to Cardiff with a broken foot.
Damari has five goals in this campaign, making him joint top scorer in the section with Wales' Gareth Bale and Bosnia-Hercegovina striker Edin Dzeko.
Israel are third in Group B on nine points, five adrift of leaders Wales and two behind second placed Belgium.
Wales face Israel at home three days after playing away to Cyprus.
Wins in both those games could be enough to seal Wales' place at a major finals for the first time since 1958, with the top two sides in the pool qualifying for the finals in France.
Chris Coleman's side are likely to be without Liverpool midfielder Joe Allen for the two September fixtures because of a hamstring strain.
