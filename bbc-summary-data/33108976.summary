Louis Dodds: Port Vale striker signs new one-year contract

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Port Vale have re-signed one of their out-of-contract senior players, striker Louis Dodds, on a new deal.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 28-year-old, who has been at Vale since leaving Leicester City in 2008, has signed a one-year contract with the option for a further year.
Dodds scored just four times for Vale last season, frequently being used from the bench, but he may figure more often following the sale of Tom Pope.
Vale are also under threat of losing another striker, Ben Williamson.

Williamson, who scored 10 goals last season to finish the club's second top scorer, has been strongly linked with a move to League One rivals Gillingham, for whom former Vale skipper Doug Loft plays.
Dodds was one of a number of out-of-contract players, including the departed Pope, offered a new deal on reduced terms - but he was keen to stay where he is wanted.
"I like it here," he told BBC Radio Stoke. "I like the fans and I think the majority of them like me. It was a no-brainer really.
"When you go to a new place, you can be a bit on edge wondering what it's like, but I know everyone here, I know and what to do and what not to do, so it was a lot easier for me."
Dodds has netted 48 goals in 288 appearances, 94 of which have been as substitute, in his seven seasons with Vale.
