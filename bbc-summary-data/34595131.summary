'Trojan Horse' boys 'not taught safe sex'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Boys at an academy linked to the "Trojan Horse" affair were not taught safe sex because "a good Muslim only has sex with his virginal wife", a misconduct panel has been told.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Five senior staff at Park View School in Birmingham are accused of unacceptable professional conduct.
The schools were investigated amid claims of a Muslim hardliners' plot in several schools.
The tribunal heard teachers were not allowed to show condoms to pupils.
The case is being heard against former Park View head teacher Monsoor "Moz" Hussain; Lindsey Clark, executive head teacher at Park View; Hardeep Saini, former head teacher of sister school Golden Hillock; Razwan Faraz, former deputy head teacher of Nansen Primary; and Arshad Hussain, an assistant head teacher at Park View.
They are accused of agreeing to "the inclusion of an undue amount of religious influence in the education of pupils", at Park View Academy, and in some cases, two other linked schools.
Opening the hearing, Andrew Colman for the National College for Teaching and Leadership (NCTL), said male teachers "did not consider it necessary to teach boys about condoms on a basis a good Muslim only has sex with his previously virginal wife, so there was no danger of contracting HIV".
But it was "not about an evil plot to indoctrinate young children in extremist ideology or anything like it", it was a "failure to respect diversity".
He said pupils were put at risk.
"The education of children in a number of schools in Birmingham was led at the instigation of a group of like-minded individuals who shared deeply held religious beliefs, sincerely held," he said.
"We don't suggest they were malicious or ill-willed but it looked as though they believed the best way to educate the children of their community was to make them mirror their own image of what a good Muslim was."
But Andrew Faux, who represents two teachers, urged the tribunal panel to have "a great degree of caution and scepticism" as to how the NCTL had presented its case.
He said the body had "wholly failed to reflect the complexity" of the case.
Counsel for all five respondents said the NCTL's case was "over-simple".
The panel was also told recruiting procedures at the school were ignored and jobs were "passed around" among friends and confidential information about potential job applicants' sexual orientation and ethnicity freely circulated.
The hearing continues.
