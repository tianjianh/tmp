[SN]TITLE[SN]
Woking 1-3 Lincoln City

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Matt Rhead's second-half brace ensured Lincoln started the National League season with a 3-1 victory over Woking at Kingfield.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
City went ahead in the 27th minute when Rhead headed down Paul Farman's free-kick and Adam Marriott turned his marker to fire home a left-footed effort.
The hosts were level two minutes after the break when Ismail Yakubu prodded home from close range after a corner had been flicked on at the near post.
Lincoln retook the lead in the 60th minute as a quick free-kick from Alex Woodyard found Jack Muldoon and his cross picked out Rhead, who made no mistake in beating Michael Poke.
Rhead then wrapped up victory from the penalty spot in the 72nd minute after Jonny Margetts was tripped.
But he missed the chance of a hat-trick seven minutes later when Poke tipped a second penalty around the post after Bradley Wood was bundled over.
