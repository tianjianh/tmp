The migrants, mainly from sub-Saharan Africa, stormed different points of the 6m-high (19ft) barbed-wire fence from 06:15 local time (07:15 GMT) on Friday.
It is the biggest single breach of the border in a decade, local media report.
Two border guards were injured in the surprise assault on the border, according to Spanish authorities.
Local TV footage showed dozens of migrants celebrating their crossing, while others appeared exhausted, lying on the pavement with visible cuts to their feet and hands.
Most of those who made the crossing have now been detained, with 20% still unaccounted for, Spanish Interior Minister Juan Ignacio Zoido said.
Ceuta is a major crossing point for those seeking work or asylum in Europe.
Together with a second Spanish enclave, Melilla, it is the European Union's only land border with Africa.
