The men, named locally as Bill Davies and Alan Jones, were pulled from the sea after the alarm was raised at about 09:30 BST on Wednesday morning.
Amanda Jane Jones also thanked the RNLI for bringing her husband home.
She wrote on BBC Wales News' Facebook page: "Alan has lost his wingman, his best man and he is in pieces."
The town's lifeboat was launched and police, the ambulance service, air ambulance and the coastguard were called to the scene.
Volunteers performed first aid but Mr Davies died.
Mrs Jones said her "beautiful brave amazing husband" fought to keep his best friend out of the water, but "he died in his arms and we are utterly, utterly heartbroken".
"He has left his beautiful wife and we are never ever going to get over it," she wrote.
"We all need time, supported by those close, to try to come to terms with what has happened and hope we will be given the privacy we need at this horrendous time.
"I am eternally eternally grateful to the RNLI for bringing my husband home to me just devastated it was too late for Bill."
