A County Armagh horticulture company has said it has lost 70,000 lettuces to the rising waters of Lough Neagh.

Derrylard Nurseries near Maghery grows salads for all the major supermarkets in Northern Ireland.
Its premises are beside the River Bann where it flows into Lough Neagh at Bannfoot.
Over the period of a week the flood waters have reached one of its giant grow tunnels.
They have now covered tens of thousands of lettuces which had been planted in November and were due for harvest in March.
Owner Seamus Donnelly said the loss would run to thousands of pounds.
"They'll all have to be thrown out now. There's no way they could survive that," he said.
The level of Lough Neagh has been rising steadily since Christmas. It's now half a metre higher than it was on Christmas Day across its 383sq kms.
Questions have been asked about the management of the lough levels. The Rivers Agency is responsible for that.
It will appear before a committee of MLAs at Stormont on Tuesday to answer questions about the impact of the winter storms.
