Cheryl Grimmer: Accused man gave evidence in 1971, court hears

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man accused of killing a UK-born toddler in Australia in 1970 once gave information to police about her possible resting place, a court has heard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Three-year-old Cheryl Grimmer went missing from a shower block at a New South Wales beach.
A 63-year-old man, originally from Britain, was arrested in March and charged with her abduction and murder.
A court heard the man confessed in 1971, but police had not believed him.
The man, who was 17 at the time, had also given details about the possible location of her remains, the Wollongong court heard on Wednesday.
Police initially discounted his information, believing it was inaccurate, but it had since been supported by other evidence, a magistrate was told.
The accused man cannot be named because he was a minor at the time.
Police have said they do not believe Cheryl's body will be found.
Defence lawyer Laura Fennell questioned whether the new evidence should be admissible because it was given by a minor who had been suffering mental health issues.
But the magistrate denied bail, saying the prosecution case appeared to be strong.
The man has not formally entered a plea.
