Murray came through his opening match against the unorthodox Alexander Bublik in straight sets, and the Scot expects another unusual test from Brown.
The dreadlocked German upset Nadal at Wimbledon two years ago, thrilling the Centre Court crowd with his diving volleys and attacking style.
"I know Dustin pretty well," said Murray. "We get on well with each other. We message each other from time to time. I like him. He's really, really a nice guy.
"But in terms of the match, I expect him to be very aggressive. I think he'll go for his shots. I think he'll come forward a lot. You know, he's unpredictable.
"You know he's going to go for it. Also you know he hits a lot of drop shots. He can play slice. Sometimes he hits two first serves, goes for a huge second serve.
"It's not easy to play players like that."
Murray won their only previous meeting at the US Open seven years ago in straight sets.
Sixth seed Konta, 26, arrived at the All England Club as a serious title contender for the first time and impressed in her first-round win over the tricky Hsieh Su-Wei.
The Taiwanese player had beaten Konta at the French Open five weeks ago, and the Briton has another chance to make amends against Vekic, the world number 58 who beat her in the recent Nottingham final.
"That's another great opportunity for me to play against someone who the last time I played, played a very good match," said Konta.
"It's another opportunity for me to try and find a way to come out on top this time."
It is also a chance for Konta to reach the third round of Wimbledon for the first time, at the sixth time of asking.
"I play my career in a tennis season context, so I don't live my career for this week particular, this fortnight particular," she said.
"I live it for the whole season and try to really perform the best that I can in every event that I enter.
"That said, I definitely would like to be involved here for the full fortnight to help, I guess, put tennis on the map that much more."
