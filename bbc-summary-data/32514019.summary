[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
More than 480 postal ballot papers have been sent out without the names of the Green and Labour Party candidates.

Labour's Karl Turner and the Green Party's Sarah Walpole were not on the list for the Hull East constituency.
Hull City Council confirmed a printing error had affected a batch of papers and said the mistake affected people who registered to vote after 1 April.
A council spokesman apologised for an "inadvertent mistake" and said the matter was being investigated.
Ian Anderson, the council's acting returning officer for the general elections, said: "We are printing and sending out a new batch of postal votes for those residents who are affected.
"This will be done as quickly as possible to ensure that it does not affect people's chance to have their say in next week's general election."
The council said that a first run of postal ballot papers - sent out to more than 5,450 homes - had been printed successfully with the full list of candidates.
But Mr Turner told the BBC the mistake was "concerning" because people were "being denied the right to vote and take part in the democratic process".
He added: "I have had calls from people in East Hull who are going on holiday this week and are angry that they are unable to vote. I have asked Hull City Council to urgently look into the matter and review their processes surrounding sending out ballot papers.
And the Green Party's agent in Hull, Martin Deane, said: "It's very unfortunate what's happened.
"It's serious enough because it's getting very close (to polling day) now. It's starting to cut it fine, but it should be just about okay."
Up and down the UK there are a number of unusual polling stations, and some unusual voter behaviour too, as a quick delve into the BBC archives displays.

"It is unacceptable that people are missing out. I hope that the confusion can be sorted soon".
Voter Brian Townshend complained that the error had taken away his right to vote. Giving his reaction, he said: "Disbelief really... in this day and age, when the full list of candidates isn't available for you to vote against.
"This is not acceptable at all. There should be no mistakes where people's voting rights are concerned."
A spokesman for the Electoral Commission said: "We are aware of this issue and have been in contact with the local authority, who have confirmed that they are arranging for new postal ballot packs to be printed and issued to voters as quickly as possible."
The candidates for Hull East are:
