Manu Tuilagi: Leicester Tigers centre agrees new contract

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
England centre Manu Tuilagi has agreed a new contract with Leicester Tigers, BBC Radio Leicester reports.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Tuilagi, who was set to be out of contract next summer, had been linked with moves to several clubs, including Saracens, Worcester and Toulouse.
He has been out with a groin injury for 13 months, ruling him out of the World Cup, but is now close to a return.
The 24-year-old has won 25 caps for England, having made his debut against Wales in August 2011.
Leicester director of rugby Richard Cockerill had previously said he believed rivals were offering "huge amounts of money" to lure the Samoa-born back away from the club.
Worcester had been reported to have offered him Â£1.6m over three years, although those rumours were subsequently denied by Warriors director of rugby Dean Ryan.
