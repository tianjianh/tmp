"I just thought that this was the right thing to do," said the 38-year-old former Scotland midfielder, who took over the Broadwood post in June 2014.
"We're trying to build something and plan ahead, rather than just look at it one season at a time. The chairman and the board have backed me 100%."
The Bully Wee are third in League Two and chasing automatic promotion.
Ferguson said of the club's board: "They let me get on with the job without any interference. They've put their trust in me and that's a really important factor.
"I've learned how to run a team from top to bottom.
"I'm ambitious for myself but if I do move on in the future I want to feel like I have left something behind that puts the club in a good position to keep moving forward.
"I've enjoyed my time so far - we've had some ups and downs but I'm sure there are more ups to come. I'm delighted to have agreed the new contract and I'm looking forward to what lies ahead."
