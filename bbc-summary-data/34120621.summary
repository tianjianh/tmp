Police Scotland review after chief constable's early resignation

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A national review of Police Scotland governance is to be undertaken in the wake of the early resignation of Chief Constable Sir Stephen House.

First Minister Nicola Sturgeon admitted the creation of the single force just over two years ago had "presented challenges and raised concerns".
She said the review would seek to learn lessons from the early operation of Police Scotland.
Opponents said the review was "simply not enough".
The Scottish government has come under increased pressure to act after Sir Stephen revealed last week he would stand down before the end of the year.
His resignation followed sustained criticism of the force for its use of consensual stop-and-search and armed police on routine patrols.
Independent investigations are also under way into the death in custody of Fife man Sheku Bayoh and officers' failure to respond to reports of a fatal crash on the M9 in Stirlingshire.
Liberal Democrat leader Willie Rennie has called for an independent inquiry into Police Scotland's operations while Labour has already announced it would carry out its own review into policing.
Justice Secretary Michael Matheson is due make a statement on policing to the Scottish Parliament on Thursday.
Ms Sturgeon said steps would be taken to improve police accountability, including a requirement that the chief constable attend local public scrutiny sessions.
Mr Rennie said the review was "simply not enough".
He said: "This government is denying reality. The reality is that Police Scotland is not at the forefront of UK policing, it is on its knees. It needs to change before it gets any worse."
Conservative leader Ruth Davidson said: "Armed officers, stop and search, the M9 tragedy - the single force is struggling.
"Now, just two years after creating it, this SNP government is forced to concede today that it now needs reform.
"The creation of a few new committees simply won't cut it. We need local accountability restored to a service which - to much of the country - now feels utterly remote."
