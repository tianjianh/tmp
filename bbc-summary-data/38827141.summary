M2 Subsea has opened its headquarters in Arnhall Business Park at Westhill.
The company said it aims to become one of the largest independent providers of ROVs (remotely operated vehicles).
The news came as a major conference was being told the UK's subsea industry needs international expansion to sustain growth.
Thousands of people are expected at the three-day Subsea Expo at Aberdeen Exhibition and Conference Centre (AECC) which got under way on Wednesday.
Mike Arnold, chief executive officer of M2 Subsea, said: "The time is absolutely right for a new ROV services provider with a fresh approach.
"It's all about recalibration. The current oil price is here to stay for a considerable period so the focus is on getting costs down."
