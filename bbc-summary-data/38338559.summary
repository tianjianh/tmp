The Australian was hit on the head by a stray Bhuvneshwar Kumar throw on day one of the fourth Test and did not take any further part in that game.
Scans gave Reiffel the all clear but he was advised to continue resting.
He is set to return to duty for the one-day series between New Zealand and Bangladesh, starting on 26 December.
Fellow Australian umpire Simon Fry, who is on the International Cricket Council's second-tier international panel, has stepped in for the fifth and final Test in the series, which India lead 3-0.
