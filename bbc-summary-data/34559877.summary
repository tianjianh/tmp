Jacob Jenkins stopped breathing after swallowing the fruit at Pizza Hut in Hartlepool on 9 October.
The two-year-old was taken to hospital and put into an induced coma, but his parents Abigail Wilson and David Jenkins chose to turn off his life support on Wednesday.
Well wishers have so far donated more than £16,160 to help the family.
A statement on the Go Fund Me page said: "This fund will now go towards Jacob's funeral costs and gives the parents a bit of space to not have to worry about going back to work for the foreseeable future."
Pizza Hut said was  firm was "devastated to learn of Jacob's tragic death" and had taken grapes off its menu "with immediate effect".
