Cyril Banks, 91, had £9,000 stolen by fraudsters claiming to be the police.
After more than £12,000 was raised for him, Mr Banks said he wanted to donate some to Shaun Whiter, 27, who was seriously injured in a hit-and-run.
Mr Banks said: "If I can help him, I would be very happy."
Mr Whiter, who played for Newmarket FC, was helping friend Joey Abbs change a flat tyre in Newmarket, Suffolk, on 1 July when a driver crashed into both of their cars.
His injuries were so severe, he had to have both legs amputated.
Mr Banks was defrauded of his savings in June by fraudsters pretending to be from the Metropolitan Police.
A fundraising page was set up by the Herts and Essex Observer after Mr Banks was interviewed on BBC Three Counties Radio.
The appeal raised more than £12,000 in less than 24 hours - leaving Mr Banks saying he was "overwhelmed" by the generosity.
"It's unbelievable. I didn't realise people would offer so much," he said.
Mr Banks said he would donate any money over the £9,000 to charities and has offered £2,000 to Mr Whiter.
"He's had a very nasty accident and to get new legs, as he needs to do for his wedding, well, if I can help I would be very happy."
The money raised will be used to pay for modifications to Mr Whiter's home and car, as well as equipment and aftercare he may need, his family said.
