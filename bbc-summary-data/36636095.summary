A place at The Open Championship will be up for grabs at next week's Barracuda Championship in Nevada.

The place at Royal Troon in July had been due to be allocated at the Greenbrier Classic, but the tournament has been cancelled after devastating floods in West Virginia.
The invitation from the R&A will now go to the highest top-five finisher in Nevada not already exempt for The Open.
If there is a tie, the place will go to the higher-ranked player.
The Greenbrier's host course, The Old White TPC in Greenbrier County, suffered extensive damage in the floods that saw at least 23 people killed and hundreds injured.
Tour officials said it is beyond reasonable repair before the scheduled start date of 7 July.
Royal Troon, situated in South Ayrshire, will host the Open from 14-17 July.
