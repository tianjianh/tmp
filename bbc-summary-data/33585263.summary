Dorothy Bailey, 62, William Barks, 51, Jason Shingler, 38, and Derek Moore, 62, have not been seen since the blast at Wood Flour Mills in Bosley, near Macclesfield, on Friday.
Rescuers are continuing to search two specific areas of the collapsed building.
The missing people are believed to have been close to the seat of the blast.
Paul Hancock, chief fire officer for Cheshire Fire and Rescue Service, described the scene as "one of complete devastation".
"We have a building that has exploded from the inside and subsequently collapsed in on itself," he added.
"There are huge complexities around the challenges for the search and rescue teams."
