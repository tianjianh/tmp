The explosion on a rig in the Gulf of Mexico led to one of the world's worst environmental catastrophes.
At the film's world premiere in Toronto, Wahlberg was joined by Mike Williams, the rig worker he plays on screen.
"It's a character-driven piece," Wahlberg said.
"It's an action movie but it's about the people that lost their lives and the heroes on these drill rigs. None of them want any credit and they certainly don't like the title of hero."
Wahlberg described Mr Williams, who acted as an adviser on the film, as "a very humble guy".
"He was just doing his job and everything he could to help others and to survive.
"I certainly view him as a hero and think the things that he did were extremely courageous.
"For him to be able still be able to relive it with us to make sure it was as accurate as possible takes a special individual."
The cast includes Kurt Russell as Deepwater Horizon rig manager Jimmy Harrell, Gina Rodriguez as rig worker Andrea Fleytas and John Malkovich as a BP executive.
The Deepwater Horizon rig, owned by Swiss company Transocean and leased by BP, was drilling a deep well about 40 miles (65 km) off the Louisiana coast when it suffered the deadly blowout on 20 April 2010. Eleven people were killed.
The rig itself sank while millions of barrels of crude oil gushed into the ocean. It took 85 days to stop the leak permanently.
Actress Kate Hudson plays Mike Williams' wife, Felicia, who watches the tragedy unfold on her TV at home.
Hudson told the BBC that director Peter Berg had taken care to focus on the human element of the story.
The actress had the real Felicia Williams on set to help her with her role.
"There's a lot of post traumatic stress that happens after something like that. It's a scary and sad experience," she said.
Wahlberg added: "The audience are going to see something that's extremely moving and emotional and a tribute to the 11 people who lost their lives."
Deepwater Horizon is released in UK cinemas on 29 September.
The Toronto International Film Festival runs until 18 September.
