The Queen's Theatre in Barnstaple and Ilfracombe's Landmark Theatre shut in January when the charitable trust running them went into administration.
"The Performers Strike Back" outdoor concert on Landmark Green in Ilfracombe included about 250 thespians from 20 north Devon theatre groups.
The free concert is part of a campaign to save the theatres.
Live music, dance, drama, circus skills and comedy, featured performers aged "five to 85".
Lee Baxendale, of Small Pond Productions, compere of the show, said support had been "overwhelming".
"This is such a strong community and today there will be people from five to 85 taking part," he said.
"This concert is about showing how well supported the arts are in north Devon."
When the closures were announced, North Devon Theatres said the decision had been taken "with great regret" because attendances at the two venues had dropped by 20% over the past year and council grants were being cut.
An online petition to save the theatres has been signed by nearly 10,000 supporters and local people have marched through Barnstaple.
At an extraordinary meeting on 1 February, North Devon Council said there was a "firm commitment to maintain theatre provision" in the area as it looked for both short and long-term solutions, including finding an organisation to run the theatres for up to a year.
A spokesperson said the council hoped to have the keys to the theatres returned from the administrator by March, with a view to reopening "as soon as possible".
