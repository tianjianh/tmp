Officers found a company trading under the name Magical Dream Beds Ltd was set up by an ex-employee of Playtime Beds Ltd, with at least one bed supplied after the order had been served.
Police said two men had been arrested on suspicion of fraud offences in relation to an investigation into Magical Dream Beds Ltd.
The inquiry was not in connection with the death of the baby, a force spokesperson added.
No cause of death for the infant has been confirmed.
