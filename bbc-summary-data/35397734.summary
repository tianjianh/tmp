Jason Dufner won his fourth PGA Tour title with a two-hole play-off victory over Sweden's David Lingmerth at the CareerBuilder Challenge in California.

Dufner triumphed thanks to a par on the second extra hole after Lingmerth had sent his second shot into the water.
He had not won a tournament on the tour since his 2013 PGA Championship.
Both men were tied on 25 under after the regulation 72 holes, but the 38-year-old American needed a remarkable shot on the 17th to force a play-off.
After hitting his tee shot into the rocks surrounding an island green, luckily evading water, he somehow managed to produce a superb chip shot that hit the flag and almost went in. He tapped in for an unlikely par.
On the first play-off hole, he made a 10-foot par putt for a half, before Lingmerth hooked his second shot from light rough on the 18th into the water.
That was enough to ensure Dufner, who led for all four rounds, the title.
"It was pretty tough," he said. "This is the best tour in the world so for me to win I feel like I was one of the best players in the world this week."
Of his escape on the 17th, he added: "I thought the ball was in the water - I got a great break and sometimes you need these things to happen to win."
Lingmerth followed up his third-round 62 with another round-of-the-day 65 to claw back a five-shot deficit on overnight leader Dufner.
Phil Mickelson, Kevin Na and Andrew Loupe were all tied for third on 21 under.
