Sawyers is a family business that transports things like frozen food throughout Ireland, the UK and Europe.
The company was set up in 1970 and has grown to a fleet of more than 300 trailers with sites across Counties Armagh, Tyrone and Dublin.
They have been bought by Agro Merchants Group.
This company was set up in 2013 and is based in Atlanta.
Agro has bought more than a dozen companies from all over the world including places like Spain, the Netherlands, California, Chile and Brazil.
The Sawyers team say they will continue to oversee all aspects of the company.
Managing director of Sawyers, Derek Sawyers, said: "We have interacted with the Agro management and portfolio companies for more than nine months and believe that their culture and platform, combined capabilities, and expansion plans for Ireland and the UK will add significant value to our customers."
In May 2014, Agro added an Irish logistics company called Castlecool, based in Castleblaney, to their portfolio.
Carlos Rodriguez, president of Agro Merchants Group Europe said: "Sawyers is a family-owned business with an impressive drive, outstanding culture and customer service focus.
"Sawyers will reinforce Agro's position in Ireland and the UK, combining their full distribution capabilities with Castlecool's current footprint."
