Plans have been announced for an exhibition on Southampton FC's history as it prepares to celebrate the 40th anniversary of its only FA Cup victory.

The exhibition, which will open at SeaCity Museum in 2018, will chart the club's history from 1885, when it was St Mary's Young Men's Association FC.
Other highlights will include items linked to the Saints' highest top-flight finish, second place in 1983-84.
Fans are being asked to donate their memorabilia for display.
The club's FA Cup final win in 1976, when a Bobby Stokes goal clinched a 1-0 win over strong favourites Manchester United, Southampton's long-standing rivalry with south coast neighbours Portsmouth, and the birth of the Premier League will all feature in the exhibition, which is being put together by the club, in partnership with the city council and the museum.
Gareth Rogers, chief executive of Southampton Football Club, said: "It is fantastic that fans will be able to contribute to the celebration of our history as they have played such a pivotal role in that journey.
"I cannot wait to see the variety of memorabilia they come forward with".
Councillor Satvir Kaur said: "Since Southampton Football Club's birth as a church football team back in 1885, the Saints have grown to become an integral part of the fabric of our city and its identity.
"It is a club that is not only much loved and cherished by locals, but one that is now recognised and respected around the world."
A series of "memorabilia roadshows" are planned for members of the public to showcase their collections - which it is suggested could include programmes, tickets, commemorative items, photographs and signed shirts.
The first roadshow will be held at St Mary's Stadium on 21 May, with more dates to be announced, the council said.
