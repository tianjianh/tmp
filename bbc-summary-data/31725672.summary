Misao Okawa, who was born on 5 March 1898 in Osaka, spent time with family the day before her actual birthday, to mark the occasion.
Speaking at Wednesday's celebrations she said that 117 years didn't seem like such a long time.
She now lives in a nursing home in Osaka and staff there said she has slowed down a bit in recent months and has trouble with her hearing.
Despite this she is still in good health and eats well.
Born to a kimono maker, Mrs Okawa married her husband Yukio in 1919. He died in 1931.
They had two daughters and a son. Mrs Okawa now has four grandchildren and six great-grandchildren.
She was officially recognised as the world's oldest person in 2013 by Guinness World Records.
