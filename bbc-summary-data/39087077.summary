[SN]TITLE[SN]
Blackburn Rovers 1-0 Wigan Athletic

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Marvin Emnes' goal gave Blackburn a priceless win over Wigan in the Championship relegation battle.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Dutchman broke the deadlock in the 58th minute from the edge of the area, his first goal in five months.
Connor Mahoney and Elliott Bennett had further chances as Rovers claimed a third straight home win to go two points clear of the relegation zone.
Jamie Hanson sliced wide and Omar Bogle headed over for Wigan, but they remain in 23rd place, four points from safety.
Blackburn's win means they have now seven points from a possible nine since Tony Mowbray was appointed manager on 22 February.
By contrast, the Latics, who had assistant boss Graham Barrow in charge following Warren Joyce's minor operation, are now without a win in four Championship games.
The visitors had chances - Michael Jacobs shooting wide after running the length of the pitch and Callum Connolly blazing over from a well-worked corner routine - but the league's lowest scorers were left to rue their lack of precision in front of goal.
Emnes, who was re-signed on loan from Swansea on January's deadline day, made the difference, collecting a long ball from goalkeeper Jason Steele before cutting inside from the left and unleashing a fierce 18-yard drive that flew past Matt Gilks.
Mahoney could have made it 2-0 following a good run, but Rovers held off a late surge from Wigan to make it two wins and two clean sheets in a row and boost their survival hopes.
Blackburn head coach Tony Mowbray: "I think the performance level of the team has been good. I think their endeavour, their drive, their commitment, their togetherness has been what's got us through.
"I'm delighted for Marvin because he needs to add goals to his game and I know he can. In the past he's got 18 or 19 league goals and he needs to get into double figures.
"If you're going to play number 10 behind the striker in any football team, you have to have goals. You've got to get to double figures every season.
"There was a lot of hard work from that group of players today and hopefully we'll get the benefits."
Wigan assistant manager Graham Barrow:  "It's a massive game for both teams and Blackburn probably just showed the bit of quality that was needed to win it.
"We think we've got the quality on the pitch and we've got the lads who battle away at the back and keep you in the game.
"I think the finger has to be pointed at people higher up the pitch. From midfield onwards, we have to do better.
"There's different ways to score and it's probably down to bravery and commitment to get forward. It certainly wasn't there first half was it?"
