Frank de Boer: Inter Milan boss 'feels club's confidence'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Inter Milan boss Frank de Boer believes he still has the backing of the club's owners despite a third Serie A defeat in a row.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Inter beat Southampton 1-0 in the Europa League on Thursday, but a 2-1 reverse at Atalanta takes them down to 14th in the table.
"President Thohir and [owners] Suning aren't in Italy but they are right behind the team," said De Boer.
"I feel the club's confidence in me but we need a win to turn things around."
Mauricio Pinilla scored a late penalty for Atalanta after Inter's Eder had cancelled out Andrea Masiello's opener.
"Three defeats in a row is not good enough for a great club like Inter," said De Boer, who replaced Roberto Mancini as manager this summer.
"I've seen that the team can get a lot better. We were close to getting a second goal and only lost because of a lapse in concentration."
