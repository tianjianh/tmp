[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 23-year-old scored nine goals in 45 appearances last season and will officially join the Stags on 1 July.
The length of his contract has not been revealed by the League Two club.
Stags boss Steve Evans described Sterling-James as ambitious and said signing the former Birmingham City youth-team product was a "no-brainer".
He added: "I do see Omari as a striker and not as a wide player, although he can be deployed in a wide area very effectively, should we decide to utilise him in that position."
