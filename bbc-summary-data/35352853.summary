Scotland lags UK as house prices rise

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
House prices rose in Scotland last year - but at a much slower pace than most other areas of the UK.

The Office for National Statistics found prices north of the border rose by 0.4% in the year to November, compared with a UK figure of 7.7%.
House price annual inflation was 8.3% in England, 1.3% in Wales and 4.6% in Northern Ireland.
Scottish prices are now 0.8% below their pre-economic downturn peak of June 2008.
Excluding London and the south east, UK house prices increased by 5.8% in the 12 months to November.
Scotland shared the lowest increase in the UK with the north east of England.
Average house prices in Scotland stood at £195,000 in November.
This compared with £302,000 in England, £173,000 in Wales and £158,000 in Northern Ireland.
