United Utilities is to construct a 62-mile (100km) pipeline from Thirlmere reservoir to homes and businesses in the Whitehaven, Egremont, Maryport, Cockermouth and Wigton areas.
The £300m project also includes a new water treatment works, two service reservoirs and a pumping station.
A series of events in March will give people the chance to view the route.
Work is due to start in the spring and be complete by 2020.
John Hilton, from United Utilities, said: "We hope many local people will come along to learn more about the schedule of work for this historic project.
"Much of the pipeline's route will be in agricultural land, away from roads, to minimise inconvenience for motorists, residents and businesses.
"Nevertheless, this is a major engineering scheme, and we are sure many people will be interested to find out more about where, when and how we will be delivering the work."
