Kimberly Hinde, 40, began a relationship with the prisoner while working at HMP Wealstun, near Wetherby, and after she was suspended.
Guards found a copy of the erotic novel and letters to Hinde in the man's cell.
Hinde, who admitted misconduct, was given the year-long ban by the Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC).

Prison security officers became concerned the substance misuse nurse was involved with the inmate at the category C prison in October 2013.
During a search of his cell, a letter indicating he and Hinde were in a relationship was discovered and the inmate was found to have Hinde's first name tattooed on his arm in code.
Hinde was suspended from her job in early November 2013 but continued to write to and phone the man using a number of aliases, the NMC heard.
She was arrested on suspicion misconduct in a public office in December 2013 and pleaded guilty to the offence at Leeds Crown Court in November 2015.
She was sentenced to nine months in prison, suspended for two years, and ordered to carry out 200 hours of unpaid work.
Banning Hinde from nursing for 12-months, the NMC panel said: "A conviction of this nature strikes at the heart of the nurse and patient relationship, undermines the trust and confidence the public place in nurses and brings the profession into disrepute."
Hinde told the hearing: "I accept that I should have removed contact between myself and this prisoner sooner when I realised that we were becoming close."
