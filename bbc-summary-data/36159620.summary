Matt Coles claimed three cheap wickets but had to leave the attack with a minor foot injury, while Mitch Claydon finished with 4-59.
Craig Meschede (63) and Graham Wagg (40) rode their luck to help Glamorgan achieve some respectability.
Daniel Bell-Drummond then made 62 and new Kiwi opener Tom Latham 48 as Kent's openers off to a flying start in reply.
Kent's England under-19 paceman Hugh Bernard claimed two wickets on his debut, while Glamorgan gave a first start to seamer Harry Podmore, who is on loan from Middlesex.
Kent bowler Mitchell Claydon told BBC Radio Kent:
"It was a good day. I still think we could have bowled them out a lot cheaper. Our catching let us down a little bit.
"If you'd have said we'd bowl them out for 260 and be 124-0 at the end of play I'd have bitten your hand off.
"Credit to the groundsmen. A lot has been said about pitches, but that was proper cricket. The two batters have showed if you put your head down you can score runs."
Glamorgan all-rounder Craig Meschede told BBC Wales Sport:
"We thought with the weather, the pitch would be quite flat, but there was a bit in the wicket and the boys had to graft really hard.
"It was nice to get sixty-odd under my belt and get the team to a decent total. We did well to get 260.
"But it wasn't our best performance with the ball. If we bowl consistently in good areas and tight lines and dry up the runs, we have a chance of changing it round."
