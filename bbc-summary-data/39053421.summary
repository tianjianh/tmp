[SN]TITLE[SN]
Aberdeen City Council freezes council tax rate

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Aberdeen will not have an across the board council tax rise.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Councillors decided against an increase, which could have been up to 3%. However, householders who live in properties in Band E to H will still face a rise after MSPs agreed changes.
It means a Band H property will go up by Â£553.68.
Council leader Jenny Laing said not increasing council tax was vital in a time of economic challenge. Aberdeen is the largest council not to raise bills.
Aberdeen City Council is ruled by a Labour-led coalition.
The SNP and Lib Dems also proposed no council tax increase.
BBC Scotland had revealed last week that Aberdeen was unlikely to have an across-the-board council tax rise.
