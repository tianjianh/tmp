Ben Wragge, 13, was fatally wounded at a property in Thurston, Suffolk, on 1 May 2016.
A celebration of his life on Saturday raised Â£2,000, with the money going towards a skatepark being built in the village in memory of Ben.
Claire Wragge, 41, said: "I think about him every second of every day."
Ben would have turned 14 on 14 May.
Benni's Chill was aimed at celebrating his birthday, his life and to raise money towards the Â£170,000 needed for the skatepark.
Ben loved skateboarding and going out on his BMX and scooter, his mother said.
Ms Wragge said she wished she was never given such a tragic reason to fundraise for the skatepark.
"He was such a beautiful boy, absolutely beautiful, I just want to celebrate him every day," she said.
"I wish I wasn't having to do any of this but to have something just to keep him here, it would mean the world for his sisters and brother to see something for him."
She said she did something every day to "try to keep his spirit here", including speaking about him to her family, wearing his hoodies and visiting places he loved.
Ms Wragge said: "This year has been horrible, unbearable doesn't even come close.
"It's devastated us as a family."
Benni's Chill included live music, barbecue and a raffle.
A summer ball in aid of the Ben Wragge Skatepark will be held on 23 June.
