"It was an excellent win. Very hard fought over the course of the game.
"John McLaughlin made a couple of magnificent saves, but over the course of the game we created enough chances to win two or three games.
"You can approach the game that little bit differently. That was the idea, a quick start. We did that in the first 10 minutes but didn't get the goal."
