"Significant changes" are to be made to a £100m redevelopment plan for a shopping area near Oxford following objections.

More than 300 people attended a public meeting against proposals for West Way shopping area in Botley on Monday.
Some local residents have argued the plans, including a six screen cinema, supermarket and library, need downsizing.
Developer Doric Properties said changes would now be made to the design.
It added these would be made to address some of the issues raised during a recent public consultation.
Simon Hillcox, from the company, described the development as a "once in a generation opportunity to invest in the future of Botley".
"The comprehensive nature of the scheme means we can provide vastly improved space for a much bigger library, better and bigger community hall and also introduce a medical facility, a cinema and restaurants."
A petition against the proposals, set up by campaign group West Way Community Concern, has so far received more than 1,000 signatures.
More than 500 were needed to trigger a meeting with Vale of White Horse District Council, which will now be held on 12 December.
A fund also created to fight the plans currently stands at about £3,500, which the group said would be used to fund local opposition campaigns, and planning and legal advice.
Chris Church, from the group, said: "The scale of the development is far too large for the site and completely inappropriate for the area."
Other concerns raised by the group include increases in traffic and congestion.
