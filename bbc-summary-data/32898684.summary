British Transport Police has issued a warning about the "illegal and potentially fatal consequences" of walking on the line at Wester Hailes.
In one incident two boys aged about 10 missed being hit by a high-speed train by just a few seconds.
Witnesses who have seen people on the line are being urged to come forward.
PC Niall Bonnar, of British Transport Police (BTP), said it was "enormously worrying" that primary school age children were putting themselves in "grave danger".
"The children seem to be oblivious to the risks that trespassing and playing near the railway presents," he said.
"They also seriously endanger the safety of others working, and travelling, on the railway, and the foolishness of their actions cannot be underestimated.
"Children, mostly young boys, have been captured on CCTV running between the platforms at the station, and astonishingly back again, as well as walking off the end of the platforms."
He warned that there was also a danger from the overhead power lines, as the voltage passing through the lines was "more than enough to kill".
BTP officers have already increased their patrols in the area and have visited the local schools to raise awareness of the dangers.
A ScotRail spokeswoman said: "We do not tolerate crime of any kind, and fully support the efforts of the British Transport Police to further reduce trespass incidents and other crimes on the railway."
