The Pilgrims need a new skipper after Curtis Nelson spurned the offer of a new contract and joined Oxford United.
"We're just passing it around the senior players at this moment in time," 41-year-old Adams told BBC Sport.
"The captain will be the captain in the first game of the season, but nobody will know that before then."
Among the senior players to have worn the armband in pre-season are Gary Sawyer, Luke McCormick and Graham Carey.
"Your captain needs to lead on the pitch and I think it's important that we have that," added Adams.
"Off the pitch as well they've got an important aspect of looking after the players and it is an important job for someone to do.
"We don't want to say too early and I think that it's important that we take our time."
