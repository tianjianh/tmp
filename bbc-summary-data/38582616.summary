[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Works to bring to an end a "temporary" one-way system which has been in place for more than three-and-a-half years will start on Monday.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Repairs to a retaining wall outside the Glen Hotel on Yarrow Terrace in Selkirk are expected to last for 10 weeks.
The area has been cordoned off to motorists for safety reasons while negotiations about the wall continued.
A temporary one-way system has been in place since May 2013 while these discussions carried on.
Repairs are now scheduled to start on 16 January.
During the initial stages of the Â£100,000 works, Yarrow Terrace will be closed to all traffic for a fortnight at the location of the retaining wall.
Councillor Gordon Edgar said: "I am pleased work is finally to begin on the retaining wall on Yarrow Terrace.
"The two-week closure is unfortunately unavoidable due to the nature of the works taking place, but once the repairs have been fully completed Yarrow Terrace will return to a two-way road.
"Once again, can I thank local people for their patience during the negotiations and their co-operation once the works start."
