The former New England Patriots tight end hanged himself in his Massachusetts prison cell on Wednesday and was pronounced dead later at hospital.
The 27-year-old reportedly marked the gospel passage "John 3:16" in red ink on his forehead.
His death came five days after he was acquitted in a double murder trial.

Hernandez had cried in court as that verdict was read, saying he was "very happy", but he was still serving a prison sentence for another murder.
According to local media reports, Hernandez wrote the popular Bible verse on his forehead.
It refers to the phrase: "For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life."
Corrections department spokesman Christopher Fallon said no suicide note was found during an initial search of Hernandez's cell.
Does the NFL have a crime problem?
Hernandez - who had "God forgives" tattooed on his arm - had not been considered at risk of suicide, Mr Fallon added.
Massachusetts prisons have twice as many inmate suicides as the national average, federal data shows.
The state had an annual suicide rate of 32 per 100,000 prisoners from 2001-14, according to the Bureau of Justice Statistics. Only Rhode Island, Utah and Montana had higher rates.
Jose Baez, Hernandez's attorney, said the state medical examiner's office is "illegally" withholding the football star's brain despite family wishes to donate it to research.
Mr Baez told reporters on Thursday the family wants to donate the brain to Boston University's Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy (CTE) Center, which studies the progressive degenerative disease that is found in people with a history of repetitive brain trauma.
The disease, which can only be diagnosed after death, has been found in the brains of dozens of former American football players.
Mr Baez expressed concern that any delay in releasing the brain to BU would compromise the study of it.
The medical examiner's office did not immediately comment after the news conference.
Hernandez was cleared last week of the murders of Daniel de Abreu and Safiro Furtado, who were shot dead outside a Boston nightclub in 2012.
But he was found guilty of illegally possessing a firearm and the judge added five years to his sentence.
Hernandez had been found guilty in April 2015 of the first-degree murder of his friend, another American footballer, the semi-professional Odin Lloyd, in 2013.
Lloyd's body was found with six bullet wounds less than a mile from Hernandez's home.
Within hours of his arrest for the 2013 shooting, the Patriots sacked Hernandez, considered one of the top tight ends playing the game.
Hernandez was given a life sentence without parole.
On the same day of his death, Hernandez's former team was honoured by President Donald Trump at the White House for their Super Bowl victory over Atlanta in February.
