£200m A55/A494 Deeside road upgrade plans go on show

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Plans for more than £200m of improvements to the North Wales Expressway are to go on public show.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The proposed investment aims to tackle congestion on the A494 and A55 around Queensferry and Deeside in Flintshire.
The Welsh Government said the road was "below modern standards" and that the investment would be the largest since the roads were built.
The first of four public exhibitions starts on Tuesday at Ewloe Social Club between 10:00 GMT and 20:00.
It is part of a 12-week consultation looking at two proposals - either improve the existing A55 and A494 or upgrade the A548 over the Flintshire Bridge between Connah's Quay and The Wirral and construct a new link to the A55 at Northop.
Original plans to widen the road at the eastern end of the North Wales Expressway to a seven-lane highway in 2008 were abandoned after a public inquiry.
