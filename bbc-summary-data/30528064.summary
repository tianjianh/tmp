The 32-year-old New Zealand fly-half will join wealthy French side Racing Metro on a three-year contract.
It effectively brings an end to his All Black career as New Zealand do not select those playing overseas.
"It will be an awesome adventure," said Carter, who will earn a reported 1.5m euros (Â£790,000) per year.
Carter, who plays for Crusaders in New Zealand domestic rugby, made his All Blacks debut in 2003 and has won 102 caps, one of only five centurions for the team, amassing 1,457 points.
Now fit again after breaking his leg in August, he previously played in France for Perpignan from 2008-09.
Carter will replace Ireland international Jonny Sexton, who returns to Leinster next year after two seasons in Paris.
Jacky Lorenzetti, the millionaire owner of Racing, told a news conference on Thursday: "Carter will be the best-paid player at Racing but also the least expensive because of the economic benefits."
"I am sure all New Zealand rugby fans will celebrate Dan's remaining time in New Zealand and he will leave with New Zealand rugby's very best wishes," said the national team's rugby chief executive Steve Tew.
