Guernsey marathon to move to end of September

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The route of the Guernsey marathon - including the start and finish points - are changing, along with the date it is held, organisers have announced.

The 2013 marathon will start and end in the heart of St Peter Port rather than at Footes Lane stadium.
The venue has been changed after criticism from some European competitors who found it difficult to get to Footes Lane.
It is also being moved from the August bank holiday to 22 September.
For 2013, the race will begin along the St Peter Port waterfront and end on the Albert Pier.
It follows criticism from some runners whose first language is not English that getting to Footes Lane using public transport was complicated.
Race director Peter Head said the August date meant the race was having to compete with too many other late summer social events.
He said: "We have been at Footes Lane for four years and over those four years there have been a number of other events on the island over the bank holiday weekend.
"Because that draws people away from the marathon itself, I thought it would be an idea to change the date."
