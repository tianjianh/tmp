Her husband and mother confirmed the 27-year-old died in a "peaceful and pain free" way.
Mrs Tancock was born with cystic fibrosis, but became a personal trainer and fitness pole dancing, aerial hoop and silks instructor.
Her family thanked the two donors who "gave her the extra five amazing years with us".
For more on Kirstie Tancock, and other stories.
In a post on Mrs Tancock's Facebook page, her husband Stuart and mother Linda said: "Kirstie was one in a million and meant the world and more to so many people.
"As you know Kirstie is a fighter and fought to the very end."
Mrs Tancock, from Honiton, Devon, featured in a BBC3 documentary Love on the Transplant List in 2011.
She met husband Stuart when she was 19 and underwent her first double lung transplant three weeks after their wedding.
But her body rejected the organs and she was back on the transplant list two years later.
She received a call the next day, and had her second transplant three years ago, having "three years of absolutely amazing health".
But the organs rejected again, and she had been suffering from a chest infection in the days before her death, posts on her Facebook page show.
Last month she said: "Now in November I'm on my way home unfortunately for the last chapter of my story. I'm going to spend however long I have left with my family enjoying my time."
In a final post on her blog last month, entitled Final Chapter, Mrs Tancock wrote: "Every song has a ending, every book has to close, my story is coming to its finale and I'm here to tell you all just how beautiful it all was."
Her family said: "We would like to thank Royal Devon and Exeter Hospital and Harefield Hospital.
"What they have done over the years has been above and beyond, and also her two donors who gave her the extra five amazing years with us."
James Barrow, from the Cystic Fibrosis Trust, said: "Whenever she could she was telling the story on her blog, raising awareness and giving people hope of living every day of life to the full."
She has raised more than Â£10,000 for Harefield Hospital, where she had her two double lung transplants.
