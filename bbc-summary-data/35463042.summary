[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Peter Kibisu was lodging with trainee lawyer Elizabeth Nnyanzi and her family at their Harrow home when he attacked the 31-year-old in her bedroom.
The court heard Kibisu, 24, had tried to cover his tracks after the murder in August 2015 but was caught when police found his DNA on the victim.
He was ordered to serve a minimum jail term of 27 years at the Old Bailey.

Judge Richard Marks QC said Ms Nnyanzi was an "outstanding young woman of immense talent and ability" who had died as a result of "unspeakable wickedness".
Mark Heywood QC told the court Kibisu had been living with the Nnyanzi family for nine months and was regarded as a younger "cousin" by the victim.
On 14 August the 24-year-old returned to the house after a drink and drug-fuelled night out to find Ms Nnyanzi alone, and raped and killed her.
He tried to cover his tracks by sending a text message to the victim while on the way to work later that day.
When he returned he called police to say he had discovered the victim in her room not breathing and the home's rear patio doors ajar.
Kibisu was arrested after a pair of bloodied boxer shorts were found in a bin and a tissue sample Ms Nnyanzi's fingernails matched his DNA.
Det Ch Insp Tim Duffield said the 24-year-old only admitted his guilt "when confronted with a whole raft of evidence".
In a statement Coleen Nnyanzi, the victim's mother, called Kibisu a "wolf in sheep's clothing" who had turned on a family that had "helped him in his hour of need."
