Birmingham prostate surgeon inquiry sees 170 patients recalled

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Some 170 men who had their prostate removed have been recalled after the surgeon was investigated, the Heart of England NHS Trust has said.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Dr Arackal Manu Nair, who appeared on television show Embarrassing Bodies, resigned after the General Medical Council put restrictions on his work.
Lawyers for the patients allege one man Mr Manu Nair operated on did not have cancer, while another was left incontinent and infertile.
The trust apologised for the distress.
A 63-year-old man who was diagnosed with prostate cancer and underwent surgery to remove it was later told he did not need the operation, said medical negligence solicitor Adam Wright.
He represents another patient who said he was diagnosed with aggressive prostate cancer and told he faced a "life or death situation".
The man, who did not wish to be named, said he paid ??12,000 to receive the treatment privately to avoid NHS waiting times.
He said he underwent a laser treatment by Mr Manu Nair in 2012 that left him infertile and incontinent.
He said: "My whole way of life has changed and being told that I can no longer have children is just soul-destroying."
He said another urologist has since told him he was "misled to some extent that this was aggressive cancer".
Heart of England, which runs Heartlands Hospital in Birmingham, shared concerns with private hospitals, Spire Parkway in Solihull and BMI The Priory in Birmingham.
The hospital bosses asked the Royal College of Surgeons to independently review Mr Manu Nair's surgical practices and he was suspended.
It is understood the General Medical Council banned Mr Manu Nair from private practice and stated any NHS work must be supervised.
He was also told he must not carry out procedures to remove the prostate or Green Light Laser treatment to reduce its size.
