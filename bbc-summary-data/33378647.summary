[SN]TITLE[SN]
Happiest works live in Highlands and Islands

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Scots most content with their working hours and daily commutes live in the Highlands and Islands, according to the Bank of Scotland's Happiness Index.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The index attempts to quantify how happy people are with their lives.
New research of its results suggests people living in the Highlands and Islands scored the highest, followed by those who stay in Fife.
Workers in Aberdeen, South Scotland, Glasgow and Mid Scotland scored the lowest on the index.
People who worked part-time were most likely to be happy in their job, according to the research.
A previous result from the index suggested the happiest people in Scotland were women aged over 65 who live in the Highlands.
