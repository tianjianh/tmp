Betsi Cadwaladr health chief hopeful on improvement deadline

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Wales' biggest health board could be ready to be taken out of special measures later this year, its boss has suggested.

But despite "remarkable" improvements, Gary Doherty said the NHS in north Wales was "not where it should be".
The Betsi Cadwaladr chief executive said performance in some areas remained unacceptable.
It was put under Welsh Government supervision two years ago over serious concerns about patient care.
Health Secretary Vaughan Gething published a series of milestones which need to meet by November to be considered to be taken out of special measures.
Mr Doherty, who took over in February 2016, said the health board had made "progress in every single area," suggesting it was on course to meet its deadline.
"My judgement is we've made progress I wanted us to make and we needed to make," he said.
A final decision will be made jointly by senior Welsh Government officials, the Wales Audit Office and Healthcare Inspectorate Wales.
Mr Doherty in particular praised:
The health board is also implementing a plan to centralise complex vascular surgery  on the Glan Clwyd Hospital site.
It is still committed to providing most services at each of its three main hospitals, while drawing up plans to deliver "sustainable services" in acute and emergency care, as well as emergency surgery.
However, the health board's most recent performance report showed it ranked worst in Wales on patients spending longer than 12 hours and the numbers of patients waiting more than nine months for planned treatment.
On Wednesday, we reported that Mr Doherty believed there was still a "very big gap" in terms of meeting expectations in mental health care, although a new mental health strategy has recently been published.
This is set against the scandal involving care of dementia patients on the now-closed Tawel Fan ward at Glan Clwyd Hospital.
WHAT NEEDS TO IMPROVE?
One of the reasons Betsi was put into special measures was the perception it had lost the trust of patients and was not listening sufficiently to the public's views. The health board has since been involved in a series of consultation events in communities.
Dr Chris Stockport, a Prestatyn GP and area medical director, believes being put in special measures forced those working in the health service to "be brave" and think of new ways of doing things.
"The degree of scrutiny on the health board has undoubtedly been uncomfortable," he said.
"But it's undoubtedly been necessary and has allowed people to make some fairly brave decisions which perhaps historically we may not have made - myself included."
Mr Doherty said special measures had been a "catalyst for change" and the health board was "moving on to where we want to get to".
