[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Milan have reached the Coppa Italia final but remain sixth in Serie A, 27 points off leaders Juventus.
Mihajlovic picked up two points from his last five games in charge and lost 2-1 at home to Juve in his final game.
The 47-year-old was appointed as Milan boss in June 2015 and Brocchi, who had been working as youth team coach, will take over until the end of the season.
In a statement, the 18-time Serie A winners said they wanted "to thank Mihajlovic for the dedication and hard work carried out this season".
Brocchi, 40, made 161 appearances for Milan between 2001 and 2008 and retired when a Lazio player in 2013.
