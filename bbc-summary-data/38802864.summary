Mulder impressed in the Desert T20 earlier this month, where he was the competition's leading wicket-taker.
Table-toppers Ireland will be at full strength for the game with second-placed Afghanistan in Greater Noida.
Ed Joyce, Niall O'Brien, Tim Murtagh and John Anderson are named in the 14-man squad after missing the Desert T20.
"While we haven't been at our best in limited-overs cricket in recent times we have a great record in the Intercontinental Cup, where we've won all our four games taking full points," said Ireland head coach John Bracewell.
"Young Jacob Mulder was the standout bowler in the T20 and the selectors felt he deserved his opportunity in the longer format.
"With the conditions in India likely to be spin-friendly, his leg-spin gives us added variety which could be so important."
Ireland will also play three T20s and five one-day internationals against Afghanistan, all in Greater Noida.
The Irish will prepare for the games with a 10-day training camp in the United Arab Emirates, where they will play the hosts in two ODIs on 2 and 4 March.
Pace bowler Boyd Rankin is being rested for the matches in the UAE, but will join the squad during the camp to prepare for the Afghanistan games.
Cricket Ireland also confirmed that top-order batsman Nick Larkin had ruled himself out of the running for a place in the Ireland ranks for the time being.
"After a lengthy period of discussion between Cricket Ireland and Nick Larkin, the player has finally clarified that his focus right now is on advancing his career with the NSW Blues in Australia," said Ireland performance director Richard Holdsworth.
