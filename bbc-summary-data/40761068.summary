[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Jodi Jones scored a hat-trick as Coventry kicked off their League Two campaign with a convincing win against Notts County.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Sky Blues were made to work for the three points by a Notts side who had their chances to take something from the contest.
Visiting goalkeeper Adam Collin saved well at his near post to deny Michael Doyle on six minutes.
But Notts came into the game and enjoyed a good spell with Terry Hawkridge hitting the post seven minutes later, before Shaun Brisley flicked a header narrowly wide on 28 minutes.
It was a costly miss as, moments later, as the Sky Blues went the front through Jones, who slotted home into the bottom corner.
Dominic Hyam headed just over on the stroke of half-time as City ended the half strongly.
Coventry continued to dominate after the break with Mark McNulty and Rod McDonald both going close.
Jones then wrapped up the win with two goals on the counter attack in the final 10 minutes.
