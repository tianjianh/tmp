Confirming she would form a minority government at Holyrood, she said her aim was to "persuade, not to divide".
Despite Labour coming third in Scotland, Jeremy Corbyn insisted the party had "hung on" and done better than expected in Wales and England.
Sadiq Khan leads the London Mayoral election as counting continues.
With all the results declared in Scotland, the SNP is the largest party with 63 seats, ahead of the Conservatives on 31 and Labour on 24.
Labour remains the dominant party in Wales, winning 29 out of 60 seats, but falling just short of a majority. Plaid Cymru pipped the Tories to be the second largest party in the Welsh Assembly while UKIP won seven seats on a good night for the party.
Counting continues across English councils but the BBC is forecasting that, on the basis of the results so far, Labour would have got a 31% projected share of the national vote, with the Conservatives on 30%, the Lib Dems on 15% and UKIP on 12%.
