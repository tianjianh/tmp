The Eurocopter EC 135 came down on the Glasgow pub on Friday 29 November 2013.
All three people on board and seven others in the pub were killed.
The names of pilot David Traill, who was attached to the police air support unit, and PCs Tony Collins and Kirsty Nelis, were added to the memorial at Tulliallan Police College in Fife.
The seven customers in the Clutha bar who died were John McGarrigle, Mark O'Prey, Gary Arthur, Colin Gibson, Robert Jenkins, Samuel McGhee and Joe Cusker.
The Air Accident Investigation Branch (AAIB) the crash happened after the police helicopter suffered a double engine failure.
The ceremony on Wednesday was attended by the Princess Royal and Police Scotland Chief Constable Sir Stephen House.
The memorial was established 10 years ago to honour officers who have died in the line of duty. It carries 255 names, with some dating back to 1812.
Chief Constable House said: "Police officers are committed to serving their local communities, protecting the public and keeping people safe.
"The officers we are commemorating today made an important contribution to the communities they served.
"It is right that we should honour them and that their names be added to the Scottish Police Memorial, a fitting reminder to us all of their contribution to the service and to Scotland. Our thoughts are, as always, with their families and friends."
Four officers have died on duty in the last year and the name of Constable Mark Murtagh, who died when his motorcycle collided with a bus near Earlston in the Borders in May, was added to the memorial along with the three Clutha victims.
Six other names were added to the memorial, including constable Richard White, from Dundee City Police, who died in November 1870 after falling and hitting his head, and detective officer William Reid of City of Glasgow Police, who collapsed and died on duty in January 1900.
Christine Fulton MBE, co-founder of the Scottish Police Memorial Trust, said: "The memorial is a tangible reminder to the families that their loved ones' name will never be forgotten and will live on, not just for this generation but for every generation to come.
"We are honoured that HRH, The Princess Royal was able to join us again today, her support for the families and recognition of their loss is much appreciated."
