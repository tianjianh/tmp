Dundee University welcomes back 1936 graduate

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Dundee University has welcomed back one of its oldest living graduates, 80 years after she gained a first class honours degree.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Anne Walden, 101, who was an undergraduate from 1932 to 1936, returned to campus to visit the D'Arcy Thomson Zoology Museum.
The visit also marked a return to her birthplace in Balfour Street, now the site of student accommodation halls.
Mrs Walden taught at the university following her graduation in 1936.
She was captain of the athletics team as an undergraduate and graduated with first class honours in zoology and mathematics.
Mrs Walden's son Neil, who accompanied her on the visit, said: "Eighty years ago, my mother was awarded the Carnegie Grant, which is really the main reason she was able to go to university in the first place.
"She had a remarkable time here and it really set her off into a career working in museums where she ultimately met my father.
"It has been three years since we have come back to the university but it is always a pleasure to see the changes here and in the city, and the recent changes are very impressive."
Mrs Walden has donated her degree classification, photographs of the university college and other documents of her experiences in Dundee to the university archives.
