The girlfriend of an Irishman wounded in Friday's deadly attacks in Paris has described how they pretended to be dead while a gunman walked past them.

Katie Healy was with her boyfriend David Nolan at the Bataclan concert hall, where dozens of people died.
She told RTÃ‰: "We are beyond lucky - people we stood up and danced with died. We watched them die as we laid down and played dead."
She said they were not sure when Mr Nolan had been shot.
"He threw himself on top of me twice, both times when we fell and he covered me, making sure my head and chest were covered as best he could," she said.
What happened at the Bataclan?
"It became quiet and you could hear everyone moaning.
"Single shots started to fire, and we realised the gunmen were walking around killing everyone who laid with us.
"We saw the foot of a gunman as he walked past us - we said our goodbyes, and as we realised what was about to happen to us, someone opened a door and we just ran.
"David didn't tell me he'd been shot, so I thought he was just in shock. I was trying to run and I dragged him for as long as I could.
"We managed to get out on to the street when the door opened and we just ran. Eventually a kind girl let us into a gated apartment and she started to tend to David's wounds."
Three gunmen entered the building via the main entrance at 21:40, about 30-45 minutes after rock group the Eagles of Death Metal had begun their performance.
Witnesses reported seeing bodies on the pavement near the doorway. Once in the building, they fired into the crowd.
