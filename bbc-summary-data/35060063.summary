The city will host the count collation system designed to keep track of all the votes cast across the UK and Gibraltar after the close of polls.
The result will be announced by the Electoral Commission's Jenny Watson at the venue, which has yet to be chosen.
PM David Cameron has promised a referendum by the end of 2017.
Ms Watson said; "We're extremely pleased to be able to announce that we'll be working with the team at Manchester City Council to deliver the national referendum count event alongside their regional count.
"Agreeing this now will help us plan as quickly as possible to deliver a successful and cost effective event once we know the date of the referendum."
Sir Howard Bernstein, counting officer for Manchester and regional counting officer for the North West of England, said: "Manchester is honoured to have been chosen as the venue for this important democratic event in which there will be worldwide interest.
"We look forward to hosting the Electoral Commission and working with them to help deliver a successful event."
Brian Monteith, spokesman for Leave.EU, said: "We welcome the Electoral Commission's decision that the result of the EU referendum will be declared in Manchester. This will be the most important decision for a generation and it is right that it takes place outside of the Westminster bubble."
