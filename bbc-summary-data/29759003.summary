[SN]TITLE[SN]
Orkney's stolen Italian Chapel plaques replaced

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Three plaques stolen from Orkney's famous Italian Chapel have been replaced.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The chapel was built by Italian prisoners of war during World War Two, and has become a tourist attraction.
The hand-carved plaques were taken in August and have not been recovered.
The "Stations of the Cross" were gifted by the chapel's creator Domenico Chiocchetti in 1964, and his daughter has supervised production of the replacements.
