Dundee council agrees to close Menzieshill High School

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Dundee's Menzieshill High School is to close after councillors backed the move at a meeting of the education committee.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Pupils will be sent to the new Harris Academy when it opens at the start of the 2016/17 term.
After a three-hour debate, members voted by 18 to 14 to close Menzieshill, which has seen its roll decline in recent years.
Education convener Stewart Hunter said the move was the "best way forward".
The move had been controversial with local residents and parents, but was backed by Education Scotland and the council's SNP administration group.
Labour's education spokesman Laurie Bidwell put forward a motion proposing that the decision be deferred until autumn, so alternatives could be considered, but this was voted down.
When the move was first proposed in November, Menzieshill High had 487 pupils, 48% of its capacity, and education bosses said there was no prospect of the situation improving.
All school staff will be offered jobs elsewhere in the city - although not all at Harris Academy - and the map of the city's school catchment areas will be redrawn.
A number of projects to revamp the city's school estate are in progress, including the Â£31m replacement of Harris Academy, and a new all-through campus at Baldragon Academy, incorporating Sidlaw View Primary and Jessie Porter Nursery.
Monday's meeting of the education committee also agreed plans to close St Lukes and St Matthews Primary and St Vincents Primary, in order to establish a new Â£16m Roman Catholic primary school at a new campus, also incorporating Longhaugh Primary and nursery schools.
