A scheme for supporters to buy shares in the club achieved its target two days ahead of deadline.
Organisers of The Big Bath City Bid are now urging investors to help raise a further £50,000 to repay creditors and build capital.
A new board of directors, mostly appointed by fans, will be selected.
Nick Blofeld, from The Big Bath City Bid, who will be elected as club chairman, said: "If we can improve performance both on and off the pitch, then it's a very exciting time."
Now fans have taken a majority stake in Bath City, the plans are to give the club greater financial security, invest in the playing team and redevelop Twerton Park.
The Big Bath City Bid was launched in 2015, backed by film director and Bath City supporter Ken Loach, and ex-Manchester United striker Eric Cantona.
