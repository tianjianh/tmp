Owner Intu said it plans to spend Â£114m on changes to almost half of the 55,000 sq m site, which will include more restaurants, cafes and a cinema.
The company, which also owns the nearby Victoria Centre, said it would create 2,200 jobs once complete, plus hundreds during construction.
No date for when work will start has been announced.
Plans to improve the 1970s shopping centre have repeatedly been submitted and approved over the past 15 years but no work has been carried out.
The latest proposed changes would see some demolition and rebuilding work with an overall reduction of shopping in favour of food and drink areas and a cinema.
Adam Tamsett, centre manager, said: "We are pleased that Nottingham City Council has awarded planning permission for what is undoubtedly a very important scheme for the city.
"We will review the decision of the planning committee and we look forward to working with the city council to move the project forward."
Plans for the Broadmarsh refurbishment have been criticised for replicating what is already on offer elsewhere in the city.
However, councillor Nick McDonald, who is responsible for jobs, growth and transport at the city council, said the centre would bring more people into the city.
He said: "Retail is changing, and the way in which we attract people into cities is changing.
"We think the development is a bonus for the city and we need to get behind it and make sure it happens as quickly as possible."
