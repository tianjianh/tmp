Court backs hold on Obama immigration action

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A US court has ruled that President Obama's plans to protect almost five million illegal immigrants from deportation must stay on hold.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Justice Department wanted an appeals court to overturn a block imposed after 26 states launched a legal challenge to the action.
But the court denied the government's request.
The states say the action is unconstitutional, but the White House says Mr Obama acted within his powers.
