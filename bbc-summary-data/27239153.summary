Constance Briscoe, who has been found guilty of lying to police, faces a fresh investigation into an allegation of fraud, Scotland Yard has said.

A BBC investigation has learned Briscoe is facing a criminal inquiry about her actions during a libel case brought against her by her mother.
Carmen Briscoe-Mitchell unsuccessfully tried to sue her daughter over claims made in her memoir, Ugly.
The Met is also reviewing further information provided by the BBC.
A Scotland Yard spokeswoman said: "We were contacted in September last year regarding an allegation of fraud, which relates to documents that were allegedly fraudulently obtained from Southwark Council. The matter is being investigated by Lewisham CID."
She added: "In April this year, we received information from the BBC in relation to that investigation and that's being reviewed."
Mrs Briscoe-Mitchell had brought the libel case against her daughter and publishers Hodder & Stoughton Ltd in 2008.
She said claims, made in the 2006 memoir, that she had physically and verbally abused Briscoe when she was a child were a "piece of fiction".
Doctors' letters seen by the BBC were said by Briscoe to back up her claim that she had been physically abused.
Police are now investigating whether or not those documents were falsified - as a doctor whose signatures appears on four of the letters said he did not write two of them.
On Thursday, barrister and part-time judge Briscoe was convicted of three counts of intending to pervert the course of justice at the Old Bailey.
Her mother had sat in court throughout the trial, during which the jury heard the defendant had lied to police probing former cabinet minister Chris Huhne's speeding points case.
