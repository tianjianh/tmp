Two inmates at HMP Hindley in Wigan "stopped breathing" after being found "acting strangely". Another man suffered a cardiac arrest.
The incidents, detailed in an official report seen by the BBC, occurred between 1 and 3 January.
The Ministry of Justice (MoJ) said the three received immediate treatment.
The Prison Service Daily Operations Report recorded three incidents at HMP Hindley, which houses both young offenders and adults, labelled "deliberate self harm".
A man on D wing was described by prison staff as "behaving erratically" and "bouncing off the walls". They believe he took a new psychoactive substance (NPD) or "legal high" on 1 January.
He was restrained and suffered a cardiac arrest. Paramedics and healthcare staff restarted his heart, the report said.
The prisoner, who was taken to Wigan Infirmary, discharged himself the next day against medical advice and returned to jail.
The next morning, staff found another man in J wing lying on his bed "acting strangely" and "incoherent".
He was also believed to have taken a legal high. He was resuscitated by paramedics and taken to Wigan Infirmary for observation.
Officers found a third prisoner in F wing on 3 January who was believed to have been "suffering from the effects" of a substance. He was also resuscitated and taken to hospital for treatment.
A spokesman for the MoJ said governors use sniffer dogs, cell searches and mandatory tests to find drugs in prison.
"However, it's clear we need to do more," he added.
"The Justice Secretary has asked the Ministry of Justice to look at how we can ensure prisons have the right tools in place to tackle this problem."
