[SN]TITLE[SN]
Naked gardener Robert Jenner's 'naturism not a crime'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man who carried out DIY tasks and gardening while not wearing any clothes was not "flaunting his nakedness", a court has been told.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Maidstone Magistrates' Court heard Robert Jenner, from Eccles in Kent, caused alarm and stress to people who felt uncomfortable seeing him naked.
But Alex Davey, for the defence, said his "naturism" was "perfectly legal".
Mr Jenner denies 11 public-order charges at Maidstone Magistrates' Court.
Two other charges have been dropped against Mr Jenner, of Stevens Road.
Ms Davey told the court: "It is not illegal per se to be naked in public. Naturism is perfectly lawful and is considered a freedom of expression."

She argued just because some people might feel surprised or uncomfortable, that did not make Mr Jenner's behaviour disorderly, nor did it make it a crime.
The prosecution has alleged this was repeated behaviour over a period of time, and witnesses were harassed, alarmed or distressed.
Earlier in the trial, witness Fred Black told magistrates: "There's kids walking up and down that street 24/7. People don't want to see that. It's not right."
The case continues.
