Organisers have sent 50,000 tickets to the larger island as residents clamour for the Â£1.15m jackpot, the biggest in the draw's history.
Proceeds from the lottery are used to fund charitable causes throughout the Channel Islands.
In 2013, the Â£1m jackpot was claimed by an anonymous winner in Jersey.
