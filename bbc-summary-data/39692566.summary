[SN]TITLE[SN]
Man 'smiled as he confessed to murder'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A murder accused allegedly smiled as he told a former neighbour "I killed the old man", a court has heard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Thomas Muir, 59, claimed Peter Telfer told him he stabbed the man twice and also robbed a woman after cutting the straps on her bag.
He told the High Court in Glasgow that Mr Telfer told him not to tell anyone or he would return and "get him".
Mr Telfer, 25, denies murdering 76-year-old John Baker in the Calton area of Glasgow on 29 June 2016.
He is also accused of assaulting and attempting to rob shop worker Owaisuddin Siddique at the Day-Top on Shettleston Road and carrying a knife on 24 June.
He also faces a string of charges including behaving in a threatening or abusive manner at various streets in Glasgow city centre and assaulting and robbing two women of their handbags, on 28 June.
In evidence, Mr Muir said Mr Telfer arrived at his house wearing new clothes and he had asked Mr Telfer how he had paid for them.
The jury heard that the accused told him he robbed people.
In a statement to police, he had said: "Peter then said 'I killed the old man' I then asked 'what did you do that for?'
"Peter was talking normally, he wasn't shouting or anything in fact he was smiling when he said, you know a cocky smile."
The court heard that Mr Muir could have heard information from newspapers and neighbours.
During cross-examination, defence QC Thomas Ross, suggested to Mr Muir that Mr Telfer did not tell him anything about killing or stabbing anyone.
The witness said: "He said he killed the old man, yes."
Mr Telfer denies the charges and the trial before judge Lord Matthews continues.
