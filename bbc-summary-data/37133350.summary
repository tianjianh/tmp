St Johnstone have completed the signing of defender Richard Foster from Ross County until the end of the season.

The former Aberdeen and Rangers full-back was part of the side that beat Hibernian in the League Cup final to deliver County's first major trophy.
Foster, 31, has been registered by Saints and is available for Saturday's early Premiership match against Celtic.
No fee was involved in the transfer, with Foster becoming Saints' fifth new arrival this summer.
He follows midfielders Paul Paton, Blair Alston and Michael Coulson, and fellow defender Keith Watson in joining the Perth outfit, who have finished fourth for the past two seasons.
"I am really happy to have made the move," Foster told BBC Scotland. "St Johnstone is a club that every club outside the top four look at as what they want to be.
"With Rangers out of the top division they've been in the top four and consistently in the top six. They've also won the Scottish Cup recently so it was an easy decision to make.
"[Saints manager Tommy Wright] seems to have a way of getting the best out of the players. The atmosphere seems really good and his relationship with the players."
Foster played 40 games for County last season after being released by Rangers last summer.
"I loved my time at County, it was really good for me," he added.
"I played most of the games, enjoyed my time there, won a cup and achieved top six which was the aim right at the start.
"It's come to an end but now I'm looking to replicate that sort of success with St Johnstone."
