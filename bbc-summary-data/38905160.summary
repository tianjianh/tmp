The pair were injured while attending a "domestic incident" in Pegasus Avenue, Aldershot, on Tuesday, police said.
One officer was discharged from hospital overnight while the other was moved to a second hospital for "specialist treatment". Details of their injuries have not been released.
A 41-year-old from Aldershot is in custody.
Hampshire Constabulary said it had agreed with the officers not to disclose the nature of their injuries.
The force said many people were in the area at the time of the incident and it is appealing for witnesses.
Det Insp Sion Margrie said: "It is likely someone saw or heard what happened, or even filmed the incident on their mobile phones."
