Kate Bush could be heading for number one for the first time in 30 years as her latest album, Before the Dawn, is currently topping the UK midweek chart.

The live album features recordings from her 2014 Hammersmith Apollo London residency of the same name.
But Before the Dawn is just 5,000 sales ahead of current number one, Little Mix's Glory Days, so may be overtaken.
Bush's last chart-topper was compilation album The Whole Story, which took the top spot in 1987.
The Official Album Chart top five at the midweek stage also includes Michael Ball and Alfie Boe's Together in third, Elvis Presley's The Wonder of You in fourth and new entry Starboy by The Weeknd in fifth.
TV presenter Bradley Walsh, who hosts The Chase, is at number 10 with Chasing Dreams.
Busted's first studio album in 13 years, Night Driver, is also heading for the top 10, and is currently at number eight.
Clean Bandit look like they could hold on to number one in the singles chart with Rockabye, a collaboration with Anne-Marie and Sean Paul.
The Weeknd has no less than 18 tracks in the top 100, with Starboy, featuring Daft Punk, his highest placing at number three.
US hip-hop duo Rae Sremmurd's Black Beatles is currently at number two.
Little Mix's Shout Out To My Ex is at four, while James Arthur rounds out the mid-week top five with Say You Won't Let Go.
Rising star Rag'n'Bone Man - who made it on to this year's BBC Music Sound of 2017 longlist - is on track to make his Top 40 debut later this week with his single Human.
