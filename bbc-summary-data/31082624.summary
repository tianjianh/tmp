[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Andy Murray lost his sixth Grand Slam final after being beaten in four sets by Novak Djokovic at the Australian Open.

Djokovic is Murray's nemesis in Melbourne.
The Serb has beaten him in three of his four losses in 2011, 2013 and now 2015, although the Scot got the better of Djokovic in his two major triumphs at the 2012 US Open and Wimbledon in 2013.
Look back at Murray's previous performances in Grand Slam finals, how he won or lost and which men and women he has to catch up with to be considered a great.
Roger Federer beat Murray 6-2 7-5 6-2
This was Murray's Grand Slam breakthrough as he survived a two-day, rain-affected thriller to beat Rafael Nadal in the semi-finals.
The odds were firmly against him as he returned the next day to face Federer, the four-time defending champion, and the Swiss player's dominance at Flushing Meadows never looked in any real danger as experience won the day.

It took Murray another 18 months to reach a second Grand Slam final, and it was Federer again across the other side of the net.
This match was closer but Federer proved too strong again, although Murray should have extended the match at least to four sets.
The loss hit the British player a lot harder than his first final defeat, and he broke down in his on-court interview, saying: "I can cry like Roger, it's just a shame I can't play like him."
Djokovic beat Murray 6-4 6-2 6-3
Twelve months later Murray was back in a final in Melbourne, and for the first time it was not Federer he was facing for a major title.
However, Djokovic was at the start of a season in which he would win three Grand Slam titles and establish himself as the world number one.
The Serb was far too strong and Murray put in a poor performance and was badly affected by the loss, failing to win a match for the next two-and-a-half months.

Murray ended a 74-year wait for a British men's singles finalist at Wimbledon and for the first time in a Grand Slam final he produced his best tennis.
He won a set for the first time and threatened to take a two-set lead, but Federer turned it around.
Helped by the closure of the roof, the Swiss won a seventh Wimbledon title.
Murray struggled to speak through tears in his post-match interview and was loudly cheered as he said: "I'm getting closer."
Four weeks later he thrashed Federer to win Olympic gold on Centre Court.

Four years after he first reached a Grand Slam final and at his fifth attempt, Murray finally became a champion.
The Scot edged the first two sets but Djokovic hit back to level and it seemed the Scot might miss out again.
But he seized his chance in the decider with Djokovic in trouble physically.
He became Britain's first male Grand Slam singles champion since Fred Perry in 1936.
Djokovic beat Murray 6-7 (2-7) 7-6 (7-3) 6-3 6-2
Djokovic and Murray met in a second successive Grand Slam final, and there were high hopes it could be the same result as in New York when the British number one took the first set on a tie-break.
But Djokovic levelled and from there it got away from Murray, who struggled with blisters.
Djokovic's victory made him the first man in the open era to win three successive Australian Open singles titles.

Facing Djokovic yet again, Murray ended 77 years of hurt for British tennis as he clinched the Wimbledon title, the first Briton to win it since Fred Perry won his third successive title in 1936.
Murray looked strong from the start, earning three early break points to set the tone.
Djokovic rallied in the second set to go 4-1 up, but Murray came storming back as he won the next three games and then nosed ahead.
Murray was behind again in the third, down 4-2, but was not to be denied despite a tense finish.
Djokovic came back from 40-0 down in the final game of the match to force deuce and threaten to level up at 5-5 before Murray saw him off.

Andy Murray lost his sixth Grand Slam final despite getting off to a decent start.
But he seemed to fall apart in the middle of the third set and could not get back into the match.
Djokovic's reign means he now has the record for most Australian Open titles in the open era, one behind Australia's Roy Emerson who dominated in the 1960s.
Australian Open women's singles champion Serena Williams has won 19 Grand Slam titles and lost four finals since 1999.
She has an 83% winning conversion rate compared to Andy Murray's 25%.
Williams has also lost only 15 sets in 23 finals. Andy Murray has lost 20 sets in eight finals.
Murray said he would play Serena Williams in a match in Las Vegas after being dared to by somebody on Twitter in 2013.
At the time Williams said: "I doubt I'd win a point, but that would be fun."
The match never happened although he did play mixed doubles against her last November.
Serena's sister Venus won seven Grand Slams singles titles and lost another seven finals. Six of those losses were to her younger sister.
Germany's Steffi Graf won 22 Grand Slam titles and lost nine finals, while Martina Navratilova picked up 18 major titles and lost in 14 finals.
In the men's game, Federer has one of the most impressive records with 17 Grand Slam titles and eight final losses.
Djokovic is on eight wins and seven losses. Pete Sampras won 14 titles, losing four, and Rafael Nadal has 14 slam titles with six losses.
