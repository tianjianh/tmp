Coleman senior died in 2014 after his son's first campaign in charge of Wales had ended with the failure to qualify for the World Cup in Brazil.
"I probably helped to put him where he is now," Coleman said before Wales meet Belgium in Lille on Friday evening.
"He loved football and would have loved this. He would have been ecstatic."
Coleman, 46, went on to lead Wales to a first major international tournament for 58 years and even surpassed rivals England in reaching the quarter-final stages of Euro 2016.
"My dad was a huge football fan and unfortunately he witnessed the first campaign," Coleman continued.
After his playing career was cut short by injury, Coleman was appointed Fulham manager in April 2003 and kept the Cottagers in the Premier League in his debut season.
"If you manage your country it is different to managing a club. Your family feel it much more," he added.
"Not getting a result, they feel it. They do. It is a tough one. Equally when it is going great, they are on cloud nine - and at the moment they are loving it."
