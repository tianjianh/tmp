Samuel Garner, 17, died on Sunday after being hit on Welford Road, Leicester, three days before his 18th birthday.
The Leicester City fan had spent the afternoon watching his side's 1-1 draw with Manchester United.
Leicestershire Police have now released CCTV footage of the area moments before the collision.

The images show the vehicle, which police say was stolen from Blaby, Leicestershire, on 29 April, driving through Leicester city centre and down Belvoir Street.
The car was last seen driving off towards Aylestone Road before being found burned out on Monday on College Road, Whetstone.
Officers said the vehicle was being driven on false plates with the registration number YW08 LLV.
Det Insp David Swift-Rollinson said he hoped releasing the pictures would "jog someone's memory and prompt them to come forward".
During an emotional appeal for information on Thursday Samuel's parents, Scott and Tracie, said the family had been due to go to Prague the day after his death.
One of his Samuel's friends described how she tried to pull him away from the black BMW.
Anyone with any information on the collision is asked to contact Leicestershire Police.
