The pair floated 260 miles above the Earth to rig up the space taxi docking ports.
It's the second spacewalk of three to prepare the station for commercial companies sending up crew in the future.
Since 2011, America has had to rely on Russian capsules for space crew transportation - costing US space agency Nasa about $70million for each crewmember's flight.
But from 2017 private companies like SpaceX and Boeing are planning to deliver astronauts to the space station.
