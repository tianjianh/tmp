The Lincolnshire rider saw off the challenge of early leader James Hillier to win by 12.5 seconds and take the second win of his TT career.
The 31-year-old assumed the lead at the Bungalow on lap two of four and steadily increased his advantage until the chequered flag.
Martin Jessopp from Hampshire secured his first TT podium by finishing third.
Riders Motorcycles pilot Jessopp, also 31, edged out compatriot Gary Johnson by 2.3 seconds after a race-long battle.
Lap record holder Hillier, winner of the race in 2013 and runner-up on three previous occasions, led by two seconds after the opening circuit, thanks to a lap of 118.864mph.
Meanwhile, any chance of Michael Rutter or Danny Webb clinching a win for injured team boss Ryan Farquhar's KMR Kawasaki outfit was quickly extinguished as they retired at Brandywell and Crosby respectively.
RC Express Kawasaki rider Lintin set the fastest lap of the race at 119.80 next time round, and an efficient pitstop saw this year's double North West 200 winner extend his lead.
"I saw that I was two seconds behind so I knuckled down, dug deep on the second lap, and the boys did a great job in the pits," said Lintin.
"I made a couple of mistakes and saw a couple of yellow flags but I pushed on in between those and obviously did enough."
Italian Stefano Bonetti was fifth on the only Paton bike in the field, with Dan Cooper, still recovering from shoulder injuries sustained at the North West last month, in sixth spot.
