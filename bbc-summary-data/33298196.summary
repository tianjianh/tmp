Beer Wall flood scheme 'to be complete by end of July'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Flood prevention works on a busy road should be complete before the end of July, Somerset County Council has said.

The works, which are the second phase of a key scheme to protect the A372 at Beer Wall and increase the capacity of the River Sowy, started in April.
Completion was pushed back into August to accommodate additional engineering, but it is now hoped it will be finished the week beginning 20 July.
The associated closure of the A372 will also be lifted.
The Beer Wall scheme is part of a multi-agency 20 Year Flood Action Plan which is now overseen by the Somerset Rivers Authority.
John Osman, authority chairman and county council leader, said it was a "large and complicated" project.
"That means an end date is especially hard to pin down as some design work is still going on while construction is underway," he said.
"The good news is that the engineers now have plans that bring forward the expected completion date.
"I'm delighted that things are going in the right direction."
Mr Osman asked for "continued patience" from local residents, business and commuters, and said the council wanted to get the work finished "as soon as possible".
The stretch of the A372 was closed for several weeks in 2014 due to flooding and to accommodate emergency pumping.
