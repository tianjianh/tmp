The East of England Ambulance Service said seven patients were taken to Peterborough City Hospital with a variety of minor injuries, including a female car driver in her 50s and her female passenger.
The other five - four women and one man - were passengers on the bus.
Two people were treated at the minor injuries unit and four were discharged at the scene.
A Stagecoach spokesman said: "At around mid-day today (24 December) a car was involved in a collision with one of our buses on Broadway, Peterborough.
"Our first thoughts are for the welfare of those involved.
"Safety is our highest priority and we will assist police fully with their inquiries into the incident."
Tahir Hussain, manager at a nearby building, said: "A few of the passengers came out of the bus with bloody noses and whiplash.
"Some of them came in and we offered them cups of tea and coffee.
"Then we were evacuated because of a suspected gas leak so we all just left."
A spokesman for the Guide Dogs for the Blind Association said three people were in its regional office building, but none had been injured and no dogs were inside.
The front bay window of the office was demolished by the bus. Engineers are assessing the damage to the structure of the building and the gas supply has been isolated.
