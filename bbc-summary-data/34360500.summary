[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Cab drivers have assured students in Cardiff they will not be turned away for short-distance taxi trips, after three sex attacks in five days.

It follows calls from Cardiff Central MP Jo Stevens in response to the sexual assaults near the city centre.
The city's taxi association has rejected claims some drivers have previously refused short-distance fares.
A 40-year-old man remains in police custody and a man, 22, has been bailed.
In a joint statement, South Wales Police, Cardiff University, University of South Wales and the Royal Welsh College of Music and Drama said additional safety measures had been put in place following the attacks.
They said two additional buses staffed by police officers and police student volunteers had been provided as well as three buses which will will run into the night to provide students with safe transport back to their accommodation.
South Wales Police said it was continuing its high visibility patrols throughout the city centre and surrounding areas.
Meanwhile, Cardiff University and the college's students' union have been actively promoting their 'Safe Taxi Scheme' following the first of the three attacks  carried out  in the early hours of Sunday morning against a 20-year-old, close to the university's main building in the civic centre.
Another 20-year-old was attacked in Cathays Terrace on Tuesday and at about 04:30 BST on Thursday, a 19-year-old was targeted in Gorsedd Gardens.
"Our security team has been visiting student residences to discuss personal safety, while the Students' Union safe taxi scheme is now being extended to staff as well as students," explained the university's pro vice-chancellor, Prof Patricia Price.
"The scheme allows you to be safely picked up by Dragon Taxis anywhere in Cardiff and taken home even if you don't have cash at the time, provided you have your student or staff card."
Students who use the scheme can then reimburse the taxi fare through the students' union over the following days.
But Cardiff Central MP, Ms Stevens said she had written to local taxi firms after concerns were raised.
"A number of constituents have advised me that this is an issue for women travelling home from the city centre," she said.
Mathab Khan, the chair of the Cardiff Hackney Cabs Association, rejected the claim.
"That's not true at all," he insisted.
"Our advice to our drivers is to be as helpful as you possibly can, especially when it comes to lone female students, we say 'Please take them, they are vulnerable'."
Mr Khan said the only time a cab driver would refuse a fare was if the passenger was unfit to travel, due to excessive drink.
"99.9% of the taxi drivers in Cardiff are very helpful," he said.
A march is being held on Friday evening by Reclaim the Night, a group which campaigns against rape and all forms of male violence against women.
Students in Cardiff have been urged to stay in pairs on nights out, stay in well-lit areas, ensure someone knows where they are going, and to "be sensible".
Cardiff city council, which is responsible for licensing taxi drivers, said it was ready to act if fares are turned down.
A spokesperson for the council told BBC Wales: "What  you need to do if you are overcharged or refused to be carried is to note the time, date, the driver's number and taxi number - all information that is on public display on the taxi - and then we can take action.
"It is a condition of their licence that they cannot refuse a fare."
