[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Stevenage substitute Brett Williams scored a stoppage-time leveller to keep Portsmouth off the top of League Two.

Teenager Conor Chaplin deservedly broke the deadlock for Pompey, ghosting past Fraser Franks before beating goalkeeper Jesse Joronen at his near post.
But the visitors battled hard and got their reward when Williams glanced home a header from Charlie Lee's long throw in the dying seconds.
Portsmouth dominated and will rue two missed chances from Gary Roberts.
Pompey would have gone top on goals scored had they won, after Plymouth Argyle lost 1-0 at Oxford United.

Portsmouth manager Paul Cook told BBC Radio Solent:
"We've played 14 games, lost one, just keep going. Unfortunately today we couldn't hold the lead.
"We're just huffing and puffing, we just don't look at it. It's a lot more effort, rather than quality.
"We'll just go back to the training ground, look at the DVDs like you do, and just keep working hard."
