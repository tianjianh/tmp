'Low-cost faults cause MOT failures'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Vehicles regularly fail MOTs owing to faults that drivers could fix themselves at low cost, a consumer website has claimed.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
An analysis of 24.5 million MOT records by website Honest John found that headlamps and tyre tread depth were the most common faults.
Problems with the registration plate lamp and windscreen wipers were also regular features on failure records.
Cars require an MOT every year, after they are three years old.
The website suggested that Hondas and Toyotas were highest on the list of first-time MOT pass rates.
