Golf: Decision due on allowing women members at Muirfield

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The result of a vote on admitting women members at Open venue Muirfield will be announced on Thursday.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Patrons of the club that runs the East Lothian course will be informed on Wednesday evening, following a two-year consultation process.
A two-thirds majority of the 750 members balloted is required for the change to take place.
Muirfield and Royal Troon are the two Open Championship hosts to still exclude women.
Troon, which stages this year's Open, has separate men's and women's clubs and is consulting members over whether to alter that arrangement.
The Royal and Ancient Golf Club at St Andrews opened its membership to women in 2014 for the first time in 260 years, while Royal St George's in Kent lifted its ban on women last year.
The Open was last played at Muirfield in 2013, with Phil Mickelson winning the famous Claret Jug.
