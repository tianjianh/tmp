Spectre at the rugby feast and why the Welsh sing hymns

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
This weekend, pubs and rugby clubs all over Wales will once again be ringing with rousing renditions of Calon Lan and Cwm Rhondda (Bread of Heaven) as Wales take on South Africa in the Rugby World Cup at Twickenham.

The Welsh are known for singing hymns, but these days it is often fuelled more by alcohol than the typically Welsh fire and brimstone sermons of the strictly sober chapels that first introduced them.
Welsh chapels - once the backbone of the entire nation - are closing at the rate of one a week. A country, once as famous for its religious non-conformity as its love of rugby and singing, is now bent on more secular activities.
Chapel attendances may be declining, but it would be a mistake to underestimate how much it is branded into Welsh culture. And never more so than during a game of rugby.
So what does the demise of the Welsh chapel say about modern-day Wales? Has the nation cast aside a keystone in the survival of its language and cultural wealth or is it simply evolving with the times?
And does the legacy of the old Welsh chapel reach further than Bread of Heaven on international days?
As a flock of grey clouds circle ominously over the Gwili Valley below, Charlie Williams opens the doors of Cwmdyfran Calvinistic Methodist Chapel and sets about arranging numbers on the hymn board.
It is Sunday morning and the service is set to start in 15 minutes. However, Mr Williams, the chapel's affable custodian, does not appear to be in any sort of hurry.
The days when places such as Cwmdyfran Chapel - situated in rural Carmarthenshire - were standing room only are long gone.
"We'll be lucky if we get into double figures," explained Mr Williams, now allotting bibles across the first two rows of pews.
His forecast turns out to be a little optimistic. When the service does begin, I count the register to be eight, including myself.
And, having never visited Cwmdyfran before, my presence has not gone unnoticed.
"Pwy yw hwn? (Who is he?) I hear someone whisper behind me.
As our minister, Tudur Dylan, preaches from his pulpit in flawless Welsh and hymns are sung with a gusto that momentarily belies the nominal congregation, it is hard to believe that at one point, at the end of the 19th Century, this small grey-rendered building attracted worshippers in their hundreds.
How times have changed.  Once a focal point of nearly every Welsh community, chapels are now being lost at a rate of one a week, unable to justify keeping the lights on due to waning attendance figures.
The sight of a derelict chapel, left to go to wrack and ruin, is not uncommon in any town, village or city. Some are derelict, others have been converted into community spaces or homes.
"It's a pretty dire situation," said Methodist minister Rev Dr Leslie Griffiths, a regular guest on Chris Evans's Radio 2 breakfast show's Pause for Thought.
"Why is it happening? Well, I think organised Christian religion in western Europe has been on this trend. To quote Matthew Arnold's poem Dover Beach 'The sea of faith is running out'.
"I would add that some of the chapels were built in almost inaccessible places to serve tiny groups of people - for another age."
But, he said, that does not get to the heart of the problem. Rev Griffiths pinpoints the traditional ways of communicating the faith no longer resonate with people.
The world has changed a great deal since 1904, which saw the start of the Welsh revival, one of the most dramatic of its kind, which swept up communities in a mass religious awakening and saw chapel congregations bursting to the rafters.
"Those fires of the Welsh revival in the early part of the 20th Century have pretty much gone out," he added.
While the flames at Cwmdyfran have not completely gone out, the loyal few who have come to the service - who, it is fair to say, are not in the first flush of youth - represent the embers of a once roaring fire.
"As it's going now, it's looking pretty dark for us," sighed Meirion Davies, whose forebears built Cwmdyfran Chapel in 1798.
"We can't attract the numbers we once could. That's what happens when people become elderly. I don't know what I'd do if this place closed."
The 2011 Census makes for interesting reading - 32% of people in Wales, once viewed as a religious country, claim to have no religious beliefs.
That number is greater than the UK as a whole, 25%, so the decline of the once ubiquitous non-conformist chapel is perhaps unsurprising.
Even if we do believe, for most of us, a good time takes priority over God - the drinking, dancing and carousing now seen in many Welsh towns and cities on a Saturday night are not conducive to an early Sunday service in chapel.
Any suggestion that Wales was a nation of tipplers on the quiet, so to speak, has always been curiously at odds with the temperance movement associated with non-conformity.
Some chapel-goers were even encouraged to take a pledge to completely abstain from alcohol, including my own grandfather. I can say with good knowledge that this oath was upheld loosely.
Still, the general consensus would suggest these places of worship are outmoded in the 21st Century; relics of the past, undeserving of preservation.
But are we, in fact, neglecting one of the key contributing components of Welsh culture, something that transcends religion?
By the beginning of the last century, as the Welsh revival took hold, chapels were reportedly being built at a rate of one every eight days - a direct reversal of the current status quo.
It was not atypical for a small village to have up to four chapels open on a Sunday.
The non-conformist approach to worship - established in Wales as a response to a general feeling of neglect at the hands of the Church of England - chapels are now credited as being incubators of Welsh culture and language, steadfast in fuelling the likes of eisteddfodau and choral festivals.
"One cannot underestimate the importance of the nonconformist chapel to the cultural life of Wales in the 19th and 20th centuries," said a spokesman from CADW, the Welsh government's heritage arm.
"They played a key role in the provision of education and the emphasis on reading the scriptures gave positive endorsement to the use of the Welsh language.
"These buildings therefore represent an important connection to the beliefs and traditions of our predecessors via institutions that once played a central role in the lives of our communities."
The chapel can also be viewed as a forcing house of politicisation in Wales.
Plaid Cymru leader from 1945 to 1981, Gwynfor Evans, who threatened to starve himself after Margaret Thatcher reneged on a Welsh language channel (the PM eventually relented and S4C began broadcasting two years later) attributed his radicalism to a chapel upbringing.
It is perhaps no coincidence that Liberal Prime Minster David Lloyd George and founder of the NHS, Aneurin Bevan, were also chapel-goers in their formative years.
"You can argue that the whole ethos of the chapel, in which an individual congregation is responsible for its own affairs, is based on a democratic process," said Professor E Wyn James of Cardiff University's School of Welsh.
"So you could say that the chapel has played an important role in the development of democracy and radicalism in Wales, particularly among the working classes.
"To some extent, there is still some of that in the Welsh psyche today.
"For instance, you only need to go to a pub on a Saturday night after a rugby match. You're more likely to hear hymns like Cwm Rhondda and Calon Lan (written by prominent nonconformists William Williams and Daniel James) than any contemporary song."
But how many of those belting out "feed me 'till I want no more" are aware of the religious significance of the words? Not many, said Rev Dr Leslie Griffiths.
"Those who perhaps went to Sunday school or were taken to a Gymanfa Ganu (singing festival) as children might remember the great hwyl or passion with which these songs were sung but they are a declining number.
"I'm glad Cwm Rhondda is being sung somewhere rather than being sung nowhere, of course but it's a sad thing that young people, in particular in Wales, are being separated from their own culture because it's more than a religious thing, it's a cultural thing."
The mention of song is pertinent for actress and singer Caryl Parry Jones. She cites her chapel upbringing during the late 1960s and early 1970s as having an unmistakeable influence on her career choice.
"It most definitely shaped my love of singing," she said. "I often wonder when someone strikes up a hymn in a pub or rugby match how we know not only the tune, but the alto, tenor and bass lines, too.
"The Welsh, in my opinion, are natural harmonisers and hymn singing is a vital part of that ability. I fear that is waning through the decline of chapels, which I find sad from a musical aspect more than anything else."
Jones is from Ffynnongroyw in Flintshire, which once had six places of worship - five chapels and an Anglican church - serving just over 1,000 people. Now only the Anglican church remains.
While she has happy memories of the "sense of belonging" she witnessed in her childhood place of worship, she is under no illusion that, just like the coal pits, with which it was so closely associated, the chapel no longer defines modern Welsh communities.
"Communities like mine, a mining village, were very different 50 years ago," she says.  "They were centred around industry and the chapel, and in their wake came choirs, poetry and other deeply cultural escapades.
"In many ways, that's gone. But so have some of the hardships, and as far as 'Welshness' goes - the state of the language and arts - there's much more confidence now. It's been an interesting trade-off."
The weekend following my visit to Cwmdyfran, I head to Dyfatty Community Centre in Swansea to attend the Sunday Assembly Swansea - a self-described "atheist congregation".
Based on a global movement started in London in 2013, the Sunday Assembly bills itself as a gathering for non-religious people looking for a similar communal experience to a church, but without the Christianity.
Services tend to be informative talks and lectures - with tea and biscuits thrown in.
Today the CEO of Pobl, a new Welsh mental health charity, is delivering a lecture in a small back room to a congregation of seven or eight.
Discussion is encouraged throughout, giving it the sense of a seminar or workshop. Cwmdyfran seems light years away.
"We are trying to build a community where we can belong, but without being dictated by any sense of religious belief," said founder Chris Hendre.
"Out motto is 'live better, help often, wonder more'."
Ironically, akin to chapels, Hendre confesses he is "not sure how it will pan out" in attracting new members.
Maybe this says more about modern cultural more than the religious debate. Is there a need to get out of bed on a Sunday morning to attend a meet-up when one can roll over, open the laptop and stream the latest TED talk in real time?
Time will tell whether young congregational start-ups, such as the Sunday Assembly, can gain traction.
For the Welsh chapel, it is fair to assume that closures will continue apace, in spite of donations made by the Heritage Lottery Fund and Cadw.
The latter has reportedly awarded grants totalling Â£300,000 to places of worship over the past three years, but has still come in for criticism for not doing enough to protect chapels.
Censors include BBC newsreader Huw Edwards, who has previously denounced cultural and heritage chiefs as "castle, cathedral and country house obsessives".
But back in Cwmdyfran - and no doubt other small chapels on the cusp of extinction - the question of preservation goes much deeper than mere bricks and mortar.
"What some people don't understand is that there is history behind every chapel," said Mr Dylan. "Just because it's not famous history doesn't mean it's not important. It's our history and means a lot to us."
Whether we are immediately aware of it or not, that history will resonate far and wide this weekend in the form of song.
For one form of worship, which is unlikely to come under threat in Wales any time soon, is conducted at the temple of rugby.
