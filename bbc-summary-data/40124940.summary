Cory Hill says the Welsh Rugby Union's takeover of Newport Gwent Dragons will allow the region to "go forward".

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Dragons have struggled on the pitch in recent seasons and finished 11th in the Pro12 in 2016-17, the lowest of the four Welsh regions.
The region has a history of financial problems and chief executive Stuart Davies had warned of a "bleak" future had a takeover not been approved.
"Everyone's really positive about it," said Wales lock Hill.
"I think things are going to go forward in the future, which is good personally and good for the club itself."
Newport RFC shareholders overwhelmingly voted in favour of the takeover, which also includes the Rodney Parade ground.
A new company free of debt will now be formed, owned by the WRU, and all employees of the Dragons will now be taken on by the WRU.
The WRU and Dragons both approved the deal before the vote took place on 9 May, which needed to be passed by at least 75% of shareholders.
The Union already owned 50% of the region, which was formed in 2003.
Hill is currently with the Wales squad preparing for the two Tests against Tonga and Samoa later this month
The 25-year-old hopes to make an impression on the summer tour as the only capped lock in the tour party, with five Test appearances since his debut in November, 2016.
Alun Wyn Jones is on British and Irish Lions duty in New Zealand, Luke Charteris and Jake Ball are injured, while Bradley Davies is unavailable as his wife is due to give birth to their second child.
In addition, potential lock cover James King of Ospreys has been replaced by similarly versatile forward Aaron Shingler, of Scarlets.
King and Shingler have played lock during their careers.
"It would be great for me to hopefully get a place in the side and kick on from there," said Hill.
