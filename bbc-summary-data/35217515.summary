[SN]TITLE[SN]
Glossy ibis makes rare appearance in Scotland

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A bird more commonly seen in southern Europe and Africa has made a rare appearance in Scotland.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A glossy ibis was spotted at the ruined Ormiclate Castle on South Uist in the Outer Hebrides on Saturday.
The bird has the body of a curlew and the legs of a flamingo and gets its name from the iridescent sheen on its wings.
It has become a regular winter visitor to the south of England, with young birds appearing in flocks from Spain.
The sighting comes a few days after a little swift was spotted in Scotland for only the fourth recorded time.
The bird was discovered at Thortonloch, near Dunbar in East Lothian, on Hogmanay.
The little swift, whose scientific name is apus affinis, breeds from Africa eastwards through southern tropical Asia to western Indonesia.
