Passengers unable to leave Inverness Airport terminal

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Passengers were unable to leave a Scottish airport after arriving on a flight from Amsterdam due to a staffing problem at passport control.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 86 people arrived at Inverness on Monday's 10:25 flight from Schiphol Airport but were unable to leave the terminal until about midday.
It is understood a UK Border Force officer was brought in from another airport to resolve the problem.
No other flights to or from Inverness were affected.
A Home Office spokesman said: "We apologise to anyone inconvenienced at Inverness Airport.
"Border Force sets high standards for its performance and we are conducting an investigation into what happened today."
