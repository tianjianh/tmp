Selby, 31, made a break of 145 in frame seven as he won 10-2 in Beijing.
Former taxi driver Wilson, ranked 56th, had shocked defending champion Ding Junhui 6-5 in Saturday's semi-finals.
The World Championship gets under way in Sheffield on 18 April, with Selby hoping to match last year's feat when he beat Ronnie O'Sullivan in the final.
"I played well for the majority of the match," Selby told World Snooker.
"To be 8-1 up at the end of the first session probably wasn't a fair reflection on how the match had gone, as a few frames could have gone either way but I managed to pinch them.
"I'll get home tomorrow, have a few days off and then get back on the practice table to prepare for the Crucible."
Selby moved 3-0 clear in Sunday's Beijing final before Wilson briefly slowed his progress with a break of 91.
The world number one showed he was in top form when the highest break of the tournament at 145 took him 6-1 clear, and a 136 clearance made it 9-1.
Wilson had never previously been beyond the quarter-finals of a ranking event, but the 29-year-old from Wallsend gained some consolation with a break of 101 to get on the board for a second time.
Selby was not about to be knocked off course, however, and wrapped up victory with seven frames to spare to earn his second ranking title of the season.
"I'm disappointed to have played like that and lost by such a heavy score line," said Wilson, who collected his biggest career cheque of Â£35,000.
"I missed a lot of chances. I can still take some positives from the tournament and look forward to the World Championship."
