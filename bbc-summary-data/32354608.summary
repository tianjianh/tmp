A court in Los Angeles has formally released video showing former rap label boss Marion "Suge" Knight running over two men with his pick-up truck.

The security-camera footage, captured at a drive-in burger stand in January, is expected to be used at his trial.
The judge has ruled that Mr Knight will be tried for murder and attempted murder over the incident.
One of the victims was killed and the other seriously injured. The Death Row Records founder denies the charges.
Mr Knight's legal team says it was an accident as their client was fleeing what he believed was an ambush attempt by the two men and others.
But prosecutors say Mr Knight deliberately ran them them over.
The video - which had already been circulating on the internet - was formally reviewed during a preliminary court hearing on Friday.
It shows the vehicle pulling up to the burger stand and one of the victims approaching the driver's side window. A struggle ensues.
Mr Knight's truck is seen going into reverse, throwing the man to the ground. It then moves forward, driving over his legs and slams into the other victim, who was killed.
Mr Knight turned himself in to authorities a day after the incident. If found guilty, he could face a sentence of 25 years to life in prison.
