Fundraiser Fiona Barnes 54, stole "tens of thousands" of pounds from Preston's Space Centre in 2012.
She tried to cover her tracks by faking documents indicating the centre had won non-existent grants of up to Â£800,000.
Serial fraudster Barnes also admitted perverting the course of justice after she faked cancer in a bid to avoid justice, Preston Crown Court heard.
She also pleaded guilty to theft.
Sentencing, Judge David Potter described Barnes, of Brigend, Dunblane, as a "convincing con artist" who had committed identical crimes in Scotland.
"Those who trusted you feel utterly devastated by your rank dishonesty, compounded by your deliberate attempt to pervert the course of justice," he added.
Speaking after the case, the centre's deputy manager Jane Robinson said Barnes' "unbelievable" actions had left the it Â£800,000 in debt.
Staff had commissioned contractors to perform building work in the mistaken belief the costs would be covered, Ms Robinson said.
"She knew the nature of the people we were working with and she still did it.
"She'd allowed us to build and extend and have all the work done knowing this money wasn't coming in."
"With grants you have to do the work and then claim the money to pay the people who have done the work".
Ms Robinson added: "It was all the builders and the lighting [engineers] we owed the money to who bore the brunt of it. Any one of them could have put us into bankruptcy at any time."
However, the centre was bought out by charitable company Creative Support, based in Manchester, which has secured its future.
The Space Centre, which opened in 1993 and has three sensory rooms, is the UK's largest multi-sensory environment.
