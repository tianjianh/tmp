The 21-year-old has previously had spells on loan with Gateshead and Hartlepool United but has not made a first-team appearance for the Magpies.
"Tom is a good young player that I have monitored for around a year at Newcastle," manager Lee Clark said.
"We also feel that we can help him develop and he can also be an asset for us over the coming season."
