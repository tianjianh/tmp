The 55-year-old replaces Mark Yates, who was sacked on Monday following a run of six successive defeats.
Drummy has signed a two-year contract with the option of a further year, and will be assisted by former Aldershot Town coach Matt Gray.
"I look forward to giving our fans winning football that will also entertain them," Drummy said.
Crawley were bought by Ziya Eren last month and the Turkish businessman has targeted reaching the Championship in eight to 10 years.
The Reds sit 18th in the table, 14 points clear of the relegation zone with two games of the campaign remaining.
After spending the bulk of his playing career in non-league, Drummy became a coach in Arsenal's youth set-up before moving to Chelsea in 2007.
He was in charge of the Blues' Under-21 side and then had a spell as the Premier League club's international coach.
Eren said the Londoner would bring "top-level experience and vital recruitment knowledge" to the club.
"We wish him all the best for a long and successful tenure," he told the club website. "We look forward to an exciting new chapter in the history of Crawley Town."
