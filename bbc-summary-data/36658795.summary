The 42-year-old will take over from Cristian Brocchi, who was acting as caretaker boss following Sinisa Mihajlovic's sacking in April.
Milan finished seventh in Serie A last season and lost to Juventus in the Italian Cup final.
The San Siro club said it was looking forward to "the brilliant system of play of the new Rossoneri coach".
Former Italy striker Montella has also managed Catania and Fiorentina, following a playing career spent mainly with Roma and Sampdoria.
