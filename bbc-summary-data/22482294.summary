[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man armed with a hammer who robbed a 74-year-old woman in Peterhead has been jailed for six years.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
James Ainslie, 46, was said to have turned to drugs after being falsely accused of a sex offence.
Ainslie, who was trying to pay off money he owed, broke into his victim's home and stole her purse, television, phones and other items - including her car keys.
After threatening her with the hammer, he then drove off in the woman's car.
Judge Lord Uist told Ainslie at the High Court in Edinburgh: "The crime against an elderly and vulnerable lady was premeditated and despicable."
The judge explained: "The crime you have committed must attract a heavy sentence to punish you and protect the elderly and vulnerable."
Ainslie further admitted being concerned in the supply of diazepam at his home in Saltoun Place, Fraserburgh.
He was sentenced to four-and-a-half years for the robbery and theft of the car, which happened in July last year, and 18 months for the drug charge.
Afterwards, Det Con Craig Johnstone, who led the inquiry, said: "This was a distressing crime for the victim and today's outcome at the high court should serve as a reminder to those intent on trying to harm our communities that such behaviour will not be tolerated.
"We would like to thank those within the community who came forward to assist the police during the investigation."
