Russell Slade: Leyton Orient reject Cardiff City approach

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Leyton Orient have rejected an approach from Cardiff to talk to boss Russell Slade about the vacant managerial post at the Championship club.

The Bluebirds have been without a manager since Ole Gunnar Solskjaer stepped down on Thursday.
Slade, who held talks with Orient owner Francesco Becchetti regarding his own position last week, said he was "proud" to be linked with Cardiff on Saturday.
The 53-year-old has been in charge at Brisbane Road since 2010.
"On Friday morning, we were contacted by a lawyer close to Cardiff City and Russell Slade, who asked us to give the permission for Cardiff to talk to Russell," said a Leyton Orient club statement.
"On Friday evening, Russell asked the club for the authorisation to talk to Cardiff. On Saturday the general manager of Cardiff approached us in order to ask us the permission to talk to Russell.
"In all cases, we denied Cardiff the permission to talk to Russell and did not authorise Russell to talk to Cardiff."
Slade led the O's to third place in League One last season but saw his side beaten on penalties by Rotherham in the play-off final.
The former Yeovil and Brighton manager has since come under pressure from Becchetti following a slow start to the new campaign, with Orient currently 17th in the table.
Cardiff, who drew 2-2 at Derby on Saturday, are 16th in the Championship.
Veteran Cardiff defender Danny Gabbidon and former Bluebirds team-mate Scott Young took charge of the match at the iPro Stadium, with the duo likely to remain in charge for Tuesday's League Cup fixture at Bournemouth.
