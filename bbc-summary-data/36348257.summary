The 21-year-old came home in 26.66 seconds, 0.24 seconds off his own world record and more than half a second quicker than the rest of the field.
Team-mate Ross Murdoch, who won 200m breaststroke gold on Thursday, joined Peaty in Saturday's final.
Fellow Briton Tim Shuttleworth finished fifth in the 800m freestyle final.
Molly Renshaw and Chloe Tutton were fourth and sixth in a 200m breaststroke final won in convincing fashion by world-record holder Rikke Moeller Pedersen.
Peaty, who did the 50m-100m double at the world championships in Kazan last year, said that his speed over the shorter distance was helping strengthen his performance over the longer.
"It felt easy today and that is the value and investment of my training," he told BBC Sport.
"It is a good sign for my 100m if I can take that speed out."
