Dictionary defends 'dodgy' Spurs on Google

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Dodgy, lackadaisical or both? Spurs' defence has come under attack for the second time in a fortnight via the Google search engine.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Type either derogatory word into Google and you might think the example sentences that pop up along with their dictionary definitions were written by an Arsenal fan.
One reads: "A lackadaisical defence left Spurs adrift in the second half".
The second says "Spurs' dodgy defence has thrown away a 2-0 lead".
The lackadaisical reference was picked up by the media last week, while "dodgy" was spotted by eagle eyes on Tuesday.
The example sentences were provided by the Oxford University Press (OUP), but fear not Tottenham fans, there's no agenda.
A spokeswoman for the OUP told Newsbeat that the example sentences are all real and picked randomly from a variety of sources from all parts of the world where English is spoken i.e. newspapers, blogs and magazines.
She said the sentence "a lackadaisical defence left Spurs adrift in the second half" has been in use by the OUP since 1998, when it appeared in a print edition.
"The opinions and views expressed in the usage examples are the views of the individuals concerned and are not endorsed by OUP, and this includes references to brands and organisations," she added.
And there are plenty of other examples using other football teams, such as:
Fightback - "a storming second-half fightback from Chelsea."
Bet - "My bet is that Arsenal won't win anything."
Nailed on - "Spurs were denied a nailed-on penalty."
Rile - "He has been riled by suggestions his Arsenal future is in doubt."
Streaky - "Wise's rather streaky opening goal for Chelsea."
There are hundreds of thousands of words in Oxford Dictionaries and almost every one of those has a selection of up to 20 example sentences from the databank.
