Simone Joseph, 36, of Willesden Green, branded Hanane Yakoubi and her two friends "Isis bitches" on the 206 London bus in Brent on 13 October.
She also threatened to kick pregnant Ms Yakoubi in the stomach so she would "never have children again".
Joseph pleaded guilty to causing racially aggravated distress at Hendon Magistrates' Court.
She will be sentenced on 13 November.
The court heard the mother-of-three accused the women of having "bombs up their skirts" and shouted at them to go "back to your own country".
In a statement read to the court, Ms Yakoubi said: "As a consequence I find it difficult to sleep and cannot take medication because I'm pregnant.
"Every time I go out I'm afraid I might find myself in this situation as something similar has happened on a bus on another occasion because I am Muslim."
Prosecutor Darren Watts said the verbal abuse, described as constant swearing, continued for about five minutes with other passengers "shocked and distressed by the footage".
The driver stopped the bus to try to stop Joseph but she carried on, the court heard.
Mr Watts said the incident was reported to the police after the footage was posted on social media.
Tony Meisels, representing Joseph, said: "She is appalled, shocked and disgusted by what happened on that day. She wants to convey her regret to the victims."
