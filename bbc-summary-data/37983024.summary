Forest Green Rovers 2-2 Tranmere Rovers

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
National League leaders Forest Green Rovers led twice but were held to an entertaining draw at home to promotion rivals Tranmere.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The hosts grabbed an early opener through Christian Doidge's close-range finish, but Lois Maynard's downward header from a corner quickly brought Tranmere level.
Forest Green were dominating and Liam Noble's curling, left-footed strike from range deservedly restored their lead before half-time.
But the visitors responded after the break, and equalised with former Forest Green forward James Norwood's low finish.
The draw extended Tranmere's unbeaten run in the league to seven games but could not stop them slipping from third to fifth in the table, while Forest Green's lead at the top was cut to four points as Lincoln City won.
Mark Cooper's side could have run away with the game before the break, but Dan Wishart struck the post, and visiting goalkeeper Scott Davies pulled off three fine saves.
Keanu Marsh-Brown also hit the post for the home side in the second half, before an unmarked Doidge missed from four yards, yet a spirited Tranmere could have won it in stoppage time when Andy Mangan went close.
