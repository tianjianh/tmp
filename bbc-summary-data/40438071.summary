[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Crewe Alexandra are looking at other options after being unable to meet with ex-Manchester United star Wes Brown.

The Alex had hoped to sign the former England international defender, 37, after he was released by Blackburn.
"He was supposed to come in and speak to us," assistant manager Kenny Lunt told BBC Radio Stoke. "He never did come in. It would have been nice to sit down with him."
Meanwhile, defender George Ray, 23, has signed a two-year contract.
Ray made his 100th appearance for the club on the final day of last season and his new deal runs until June 2019.
Lunt, talking about missing out on Brown, added: "We've moved on and we're now looking at different options.
"I wouldn't say there's no chance [of signing him] but we've got a list of players that we're looking at."
League Two side Crewe have signed one new defender this summer, Michael Raynes from Carlisle United, but they have lost Jon Guthrie to Walsall and Ollie Turton to Blackpool.
