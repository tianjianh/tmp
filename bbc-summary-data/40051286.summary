The court heard Balu had also gone through a red light before hitting Ms Shapiro on Birmingham Road, West Midlands Police said.
Police said in his defence, Balu claimed he was trying to wipe away ice from his window and had been dazzled by the sun which distracted him.
Following the sentencing Ms Shapiro's mother, Joanne Corbett, paid tribute to her "beautiful, kind and exceptional" daughter, who she described as her "best friend".
"She was, and always will be, my inspiration," she added.
Balu was also disqualified from driving for nine-and-a-half years.
