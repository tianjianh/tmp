A feature on Nicola Sturgeon appeared in the publication's October edition.
She spoke at length to writer Susie Rushton and had pictures taken by fashion photographer Benjamin McMahon.
Ms Sturgeon told journalists she did "sometimes suffer from a bit of internal conflict" about whether she should take part in such photo shoots.
She said comments about her appearance were often "written in the most hideous and quite cruel way".
The SNP leader added: "I have the dilemma of knowing whatever I do people are going to talk about what I wear and what my hair looks like, and I could and, maybe should, just decide that I'm not going to engage with that on any level.
"Or I can decide, as I sometimes do, that I'll try to turn it into a positive in some way."
Ms Sturgeon went on to explain that she was keen to promote Scottish designers by wearing their clothes.
"But you will find people with different opinion, sometimes I'm a bit internally conflicted by it," she added.
Ms Sturgeon quipped that since Jeremy Corbyn's election as Labour leader, "male politicians are getting talked about for what they wear just as much as female politicians".
She added: "His dress sense has been subject to as much commentary over the past couple of weeks as mine has been."
