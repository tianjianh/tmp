Germany rejected a Greek request for a six-month extension to its loan programme without austerity reforms, calling it a "Trojan horse" proposal.
Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 and broader Topix both closed 0.3% up at 18,321 and 1,499.28 respectively.
Trading in the rest of Asia was quiet over the Lunar New Year holiday.
Markets in China, Hong Kong, Malaysia, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan and Vietnam remain closed.
In Sydney, the S&P/ASX 200 ended 0.4% lower at 5,881.50 because of a decline in mining and energy stocks. New Zealand stocks rose 0.4% to finish at 5,748.95.
Andrew Kenningham, senior global economist at Capital Economics said a Greek exit from the eurozone would be felt primarily through the financial markets.
"The shock of 'Grexit' finally taking place would be likely to dampen global risk appetite, leading to a sell-off in global equities and some emerging market assets," he wrote in a report.
"On the other hand, there would be an increase in demand for safe havens, including non-euro government bonds and gold."
Gold prices rose by more than 1% and the metal was trading at about $1,208.70 an ounce in the US spot market overnight.
