England will wait on the fitness of Ben Stokes before naming their squad for the second Test against Sri Lanka.

The all-rounder appeared to jar his left knee while bowling on day two of England's innings-and-88-run win in the first Test at Headingley.
Stokes, 24, will have a scan on Sunday, with the results - and the party for the Test at Chester-le-Street - not expected until Monday.
The match, the second of three Tests, begins on Friday.

It he his fit, it will be the first time that Durham all-rounder Stokes has played a Test on his home ground.
However, England cricket director Andrew Strauss said Stokes' participation is "touch and go".
Speaking to BBC Radio 5 live's Sportsweek on Sunday, Strauss said: "He was struggling yesterday. The plan is to see how he is today.
"We know what he is like - you have to drag him off the pitch kicking and screaming, but we're mindful of a busy summer ahead as well."
Stokes left the field on the second evening of England's win and did not bowl on Saturday as they wrapped up a three-day victory.
If he is ruled out of the second Test, Warwickshire all-rounder Chris Woakes would be a like-for-like replacement in the squad.
England may also opt to re-jig their batting order and give a debut to Nottinghamshire pace bowler Jake Ball.
