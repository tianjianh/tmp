Dumfries and Galloway Council asks for share of UK flood relief cash

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Dumfries and Galloway Council has said flood victims in the area should receive a share of UK government money to help those hit by severe weather.

Prime Minister David Cameron said last week that money was "no object" in the effort to aid households and businesses flooded in England in recent weeks.
Parts of Dumfries and Galloway were hit by flooding over the festive period.
Councillor Colin Smyth has called on Scottish ministers to ensure the region gets a share of any additional cash.
He said: "What we are asking is, if there is funding being made available in the south of England will Scotland receive some of that as part of the Barnett formula?
"And secondly we want to know from the Scottish government, if this is the case, will they make sure that money is spent in the areas that actually suffered from flooding."
Dumfries and Galloway was one of the Scottish areas hardest hit by flooding at the end of last year and over the new year period, with residents of Kirkconnel, Carsphairn and Moniaive having to be evacuated.
One family was rescued by helicopter after their farm house beside the River Nith near Closeburn was cut off by rising water.
Just days later, coastal communities along the Solway bore the brunt of more severe flooding as high tides, storm surges and gale force winds combined to overwhelm sea defences.
In January, Scotland's Environment Minister Paul Wheelhouse said flood risk management was a "priority".
He said Cosla and the Scottish government had a "pot" of Â£42m available to local authorities to bid for to help tackling flooding issues.
