Ovingham road bridge to reopen after repairs

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A flood-damaged road bridge in Northumberland that has been closed for nearly two years is reopening later.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The bridge at Ovingham briefly opened in December last year before the worst flooding since the 1700s closed it again two days later.
It previously closed in June 2014 for a £3m refurbishment.
The single-lane steel and timber structure, which links the village with Prudhoe, was built in 1883 and has carried about 5,000 vehicles a day.
Now after a further extensive repair programme, costing £1.4m and funded by the Department for Transport, the bridge is reopening.
A spokesman for Northumberland County Council said: "While Ovingham Bridge is one of the more iconic structures damaged during the winter floods, work is still ongoing on numerous repair schemes across the county as part of the £14m highway flood damage repair programme."
