'Amazing' response to Dumfries and Galloway aid appeal

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
When a drowned three-year-old Syrian refugee was photographed lying face-down on a Turkish beach, the harrowing image sent shockwaves around the world.

Its ripples were felt far and wide, and across the UK thousands of people felt moved to help those embroiled in the crisis.
None more so than in the south-west of Scotland, where organisers of a mercy mission to Calais have been overwhelmed by donations.
A local Facebook group set up to collect clothing, food and camping equipment for refugees has more than 2,500 members.
It has resulted in "mountains of stuff" being given to a network of volunteers across the region by people desperate to help.
In church halls, community centres and living rooms, clothes, shoes, hygiene packs, toys, sleeping bags, and tents have been collected, sorted and packed.
The drive was launched by Moxie DePaulitte several weeks ago in an effort to "humanise" the people living in refugee camps.
"I originally wanted to do a project where I thought people could draw colourful pictures, write notes of encouragement and support that then would be sent over to people in refugee camps," she said.
"And I thought people might drop off a tin of beans or a sleeping bag or a few old clothes that I could taken down in a van and help distribute it."
The mother of three said the publication of the heartbreaking photograph of Alan Kurdi caused a "swell" in donations.
"I think the climate changed in this country towards refugees when they saw that picture," she added.
"But I personally kind of found it quite upsetting that it takes pictures of a dead baby for people to start having compassion and care, in a way.
"At least his death wasn't completely in vain because it's made people spring into action."
Mother-of-six Vanessa Gaskell was among more than a dozen volunteers who sorted through donated goods at a hall donated by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints in Dumfries on Thursday.
The 36-year-old said she decided to volunteer after speaking to people who claimed others were "jumping on the bandwagon" to help the Syrian refugees when there are many others who have been ignored in the past.
"My opinion is if a few people can do a little bit, then that's amazing. It's better than not doing anything at all. And I don't think this is classed as a little bit, quite frankly.
"What we have seen here this week has been amazing and the amount of people that have just dropped things and run to help. It's really heart warming, it's fantastic."
Their appeal has grown "incredibly big, incredibly fast", said Ms DePaulitte.  So much so that some hubs have had to close to further donations, having reached capacity.
Their initial plan to drive an articulated lorry of goods to Calais this weekend has also been put on hold.
Despite an army of volunteers, the sheer volume of donations mean they are struggling to process them - something that is necessary to ensure that each item is sent to the right place.
Ms DePaulitte said: "We've had lots of clothing, we've had food, shelter, old camping equipment, pots, pan.
"We've had children's clothes and women's clothes and toys which we said up front that we're not specifically needing for Calais but sometimes that's all people have to give - and they want to give.
"I don't want to turn them away so what we've said now is we'll send them to Kos or Hungary, maybe even Serbia or Syria."
Volunteer Elaine Scott, 74, has spent four days helping to sort clothing at the processing centre in Dumfries.
She said the response has been "absolutely incredible".
"I can't believe a little town of Dumfries can bring as much stuff as this," she added.
"The people have been wonderful. I can't understand why the churches are empty when there's so much love around."
After learning that the migrant camp in Calais has been overwhelmed by donations, Ms DePaulitte now plans to make a series of trips to France over the winter.
She said : "We don't want to give them any more logistical headaches, we want to make sure the aid we send goes to the right people and doesn't end up causing more problems so we've been trying to work with them to make sure the goods get to them in a timely fashion."
She added: "People are saying they've got loads of clothes, they've got loads of camping stuff.
"But they're living in harsh conditions, they're not just camping for the weekend and then going back home and putting their things through the wash and the tumble drier -  things are rotting and destroying, people are very ill.
"So now we're hoping to slow things down, take things down a gear, and to sort of drip feed things down to Calais."
The group are still accepting donations at local hubs but she said they are most in need of financial contributions.
They also hope to acquire a flat-bed truck, a lorry with a tail lift and a fork-lift to help them with the delivery.
"It's an amazing thing that's happened in Dumfries and Galloway and people should be really proud," Ms DePaulitte said.
"People are coming from all different backgrounds, all different faiths, all political parties, everything has been dropped just to focus on people in need and it's not very often that things like that happen."
Margaret Hair, 77, said she couldn't believe the generosity of people.
"It was absolutely great. It just kind of touched your heart a wee bit. I just enjoy coming in and helping.
"That's all we can do, isn't it? Help a wee bit. If we all help a wee bit, it's amazing what we can do, working together."
