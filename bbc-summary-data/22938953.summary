The company, which develops and manufactures veterinary pharmaceutical products, is expanding to meet a growing global demand.
It currently employs around 1,700 people at three factories in the city.
The company is controlled by its founder, Lord Ballyedmond, Northern Ireland's wealthiest man with an estimated fortune of £860m.
His wealth is in part due to a high-end property portfolio.
Norbrook has already employed around 200 people this year.
Last year, Norbrook made pre-tax profits of £16m.
According to the company the jobs will range across several areas including production, scientific analysis, research, finance and engineering.
It said there is "an excellent recruitment pool" in Northern Ireland.
"The new jobs will be spread right across the full spectrum of our operation," said James Gibbs, recruitment manager of Norbrook.
"Norbrook is a true Northern Ireland success story which has defied the recession by continuing to grow," he stated.
In recent years it has invested £150m in expanding its facilities in Newry, with new production suites, warehousing and office space.
Recently, there was another boost to the pharmaceuticals sector when Almac, based in Craigavon, said it was creating 229 new posts.
