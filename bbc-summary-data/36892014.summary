Bryan Lewis Jones's timber frame "eco" building, The Shed, rotates 360 degrees to follow the sun throughout the day in its woodland setting in St Asaph.
It squares up against three finalists, including a shed on wheels, in the competition's unique category.
Also nominated in the historical category is the Carmarthenshire shed used by writer Dylan Thomas.
It stands on stilts above the estuary in Laugharne and has been furnished to re-create the interior as it would have been when Thomas was there.
The public picked finalists in eight categories, including budget and unexpected, from 2,825 entries.
The overall winner will be selected on the Channel 4 TV series, Amazing Spaces Shed of the Year, starting on Friday.
