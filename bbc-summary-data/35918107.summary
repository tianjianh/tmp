[SN]TITLE[SN]
Hidden camera sex offender has prison sentence reduced

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man who set up a hidden camera and filmed himself sexually assaulting a 10-year-old girl has had his four year prison sentence reduced.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Kevin Enticknap modified shower gel containers and a washbag to conceal recording equipment and made videos of women and children using his bathroom.
The 42-year-old was jailed in December 2015 after admitting the offences.
Appeal judges ruled Sheriff Elizabeth Munro's sentence was excessive and that Enticknap should serve 32 months.
Enticknap, of Forres, Moray, was convicted after pleading guilty to repeatedly breaching the Sexual Offences Scotland Act.
Dundee Sheriff Court heard he had drilled holes in the walls of the bathroom and his bedroom and run cables between them to make the films.
Judges Lady Dorrian and Lord Bracadale reduced Enticknap's sentence at the Court of Criminal Appeal in Edinburgh.
The judges came to the decision partly because Enticknap had not previously served a custodial sentence.
