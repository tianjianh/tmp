New Great British Bake Off judge Prue Leith has said sorry to Chris Evans - after using him as an example of how not to take over a hit TV show.

Leith, who will fill Mary Berry's shoes on Bake Off, said she "doesn't want to do a Chris Evans" - referring to his short-lived stint as host of Top Gear.
On his BBC Radio 2 show, Evans revealed she had emailed him to apologise.
Leith will judge Bake Off with Paul Hollywood, with Noel Fielding and Sandi Toksvig as the new co-presenters.
Before her appointment was confirmed, Leith said: "It's a bit scary following Mary, but I don't want to do a Chris Evans."
Evans told listeners: "I thought, well, that's fair enough.
"So I said on the air on Tuesday, if you want any tips about the potential pitfalls, as long as you cook me lunch, Prue, because let's face it, it's not going to be the worst lunch in the world, we can have a chat about that.
"She emailed me after the show. She said, 'What a silly thing to say.'
"I said, 'No, it's the perfect thing to say because a) it got you publicity for the new show and b) it's absolutely right, by the way!"
Evans took over Top Gear with Matt LeBlanc after Jeremy Clarkson, Richard Hammond and James May left. But he only lasted one series.
Leith, Fielding and Toksvig will join Bake Off when the new series begins on Channel 4 this autumn.
