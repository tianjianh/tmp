Offbeat moments from the campaign trail

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Polling day in the UK general election is drawing near and the campaign is entering its final phase. For the photographers who have been following the politicians around the country, it has been an intense period.

Martin Keene, the picture editor at the Press Association - the UK's national news agency - is leading the team covering the election.
His photographers are always on the lookout for the moment that could become a defining one of the election, as well as offbeat ways to cover the event. Together with his team, he has chosen some of the best moments so far.

Never work with children or animals, they say. David Cameron found that out to his cost when six-year-old Lucy momentarily placed her head on the desk seemingly bored with the prime minister's reading lesson. Actually she was just giggling at her mispronunciation of a word.
UKIP leader Nigel Farage was totally isolated at the end of the BBC's opposition leaders' debate when the other four participants congratulated each other. After what seemed like minutes they eventually went to shake his hand.
This has definitely become the selfie election. Extra time has to be factored into every politician's visit these days for the added time it takes to fulfil everyone's photo requests. This was Labour leader Ed Miliband in Acton in London, faced with a supporter's camera.
Ed Miliband launches his party's manifesto. I love the serious and menacing feel to the picture. Right in the middle, right down the lens.

Throughout the election campaign we are constantly presented with anodyne backdrops against which to photograph the various candidates.  Occasionally the backdrop is very much at odds with what it is masking.  I like the sensation created in this image that Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg is being watched by one of his predecessors as leader.
Selfies have become a bit of a cliche photo opportunity during a candidate's walkabout.  However, this young lady who photographed herself with the prime minister in Alnwick looks genuinely shocked by who she is standing beside.  This picture made the front page of the following day's Daily Telegraph.
During the same walkabout where the selfie was taken, David Cameron also encountered a lady whom he spoke to while her daughter retreated behind her legs.  The displeasure of the young girl is juxtaposed nicely with the earnestness of Mr Cameron's expression.  This occurred a week after Mr Cameron was photographed in a less than flattering, although humorous moment, with another young girl during a reading session in a school (above).  Aware of the potential negative impact of that image, one of Mr Cameron's press aides attempted to block me from taking this image.  Fortunately, I was quicker off the mark and the picture was published in both the next day's Times and Metro.
A colleague of mine from another agency had requested a very quick opportunity to make a portrait of Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg during a visit to a cricket ground in Hampshire.  The moment of the portrait being made caught my eye but it wasn't until I was editing my images that I realised my colleague had an admirer on the left of the frame.  This picture was used prominently in the next day's Guardian.

Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon turned to thank supporters while on the general election campaign trail in Ayr.  As she did so she placed her hands together and for a brief moment appeared to pray to an SNP flag.

Nick Clegg having a go at 10-pin bowling was a relatively rare example of one of the party leaders getting involved in an activity beyond set-piece speeches or staged meet and greets. It was published widely the next day.  It was slightly bizarre being among a gaggle of photographers and TV cameras balancing on the narrow strip between bowling lanes as balls whizzed by.  Mr Clegg's bowling ended up looking better in a still picture than on TV - it was a pretty low-scoring effort from the Lib Dem leader who put a couple of shots in the gutter.

Labour leader Ed Miliband speaks at the National Composites Centre during a workplace question-and-answer session in Bristol.  With Ed Miliband choosing to conduct most of his election campaign from behind a lectern and in front of a red Labour backdrop and slogan, the opportunities for a great picture are limited. I took this picture quite early into the Labour campaign, and although the method is a well-trodden path by press photographers, it produces a great picture. The Guardian used it on their front page the next day.

We're all used to seeing UKIP leader Nigel Farage on the campaign trail, beer in hand, amazing facial expressions and surrounded by the media. After spending time with him covering his campaign you see the quieter moments where he gathers his thoughts before taking centre stage and encouraging support. This particular frame was shot in a community hall in Ramsgate at the final event of a day of public meetings in South Thanet.
As with any election there are always independent candidates and smaller minority parties which can be just as interesting as the main players. Dame Jon Dixon of The Official Monster Raving Loony Party is standing for the Hove and Portslade seat in East Sussex and agreed to let us join him on the campaign trail. In the highly amusing and refreshing couple of hours we were with him, we managed to recreate political pictures such as posing at the door of No. 10 Downing Street, a politician in his kitchen and finally prove, after the famous Ed Miliband eating a bacon sandwich picture, that they can be eaten with some style.
(Jeremy Selwyn took the famous picture of Ed Miliband eating the bacon sandwich and you can hear him speaking about the moment in a previous post.)
As the battle for South Thanet intensifies Mayor of London Boris Johnson visited Ramsgate to canvass for Conservative candidate Craig Mackinlay. The hectic visit concluded with high levels of both public and media interest as he was driven away giving a thumbs-up to the gathered crowd of supporters with bright red lipstick on his cheek.
After meeting parents and children at the Book Nook bookshop in Hove, East Sussex, Ed Balls and Rachel Reeves were invited to read to some young children. They chose to read both The Tiger Who Came to Tea and We're Going on a Bear Hunt. Mr Balls said afterwards it was one of the best mornings he'd had on a busy election campaign, and you can tell from the image that they both got stuck into the story.

We were down in Cornwall and went to a fish market. Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg had already picked up two fish before this one but this was the only time he picked the fish up and looked at it. I liked this picture because of the serious face he pulls and the fact he is starring straight at it.
