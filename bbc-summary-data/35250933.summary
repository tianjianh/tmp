The impact of wet weather in Calderdale has been described by Barry Collins, the Labour deputy leader of Calderdale Council, as a "total calamity".
He added that as a result, around 118 bridges required continuing inspection.
"It's going to take a huge amount of work and new investment to get things back to normal," he said, explaining the area had around 300 bridges.
"We are monitoring the key ones, that's about 118 bridges regularly at the moment in the aftermath of the floods."
"The flood was just a total calamity in Calderdale from one end to the other."
The Elland Bridge in Elland remains closed after it partially collapsed on 29 December.
A barge was wedged against the grade II listed bridge, with several others left stranded on the towpath when high water receded.
The council has said the bridge is beyond repair and will need to be replaced.
