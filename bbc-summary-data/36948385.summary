[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Jason Marr's first-half strike earned Alloa Athletic a place in the Scottish League Cup quarter-finals as Premiership Inverness were knocked out.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Liam Polworth saw a powerful drive from the edge of the box tipped on to the bar by Alloa's Neil Parry before the League One side took the initiative.
Marr's close-range shot crept over the line following a corner.
The visitors' best chance to level fell to Iain Vigurs, his volley narrowly off target.
And so Alloa make it six wins out of six in all competitions and go into Wednesday night's draw for the last eight.
Despite having more of the ball, Richie Foran's side were denied clear-cut chances by Jack Ross' well-drilled Alloa.
The Wasps had already dispatched Inverness' Highland neighbours Ross County from the League Cup at the first-round group stage.
And they proved that was no one-off.
Marr notched the decisive strike as the half-hour approached, reacting quickly to get on the end of a corner and force the ball over the line.
Inverness, having been frustrated by Parry's save from Polworth's shot, battled hard to get back into the tie.
Vigurs twice went close, including his late volley wide, but Alloa's perseverance was rewarded with a place in the quarter-finals.
