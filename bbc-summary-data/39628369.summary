After the 2011 London riots, photographer Julian Mahrlein set out on a project to capture the faces of inner-city teenagers.

He began wandering across the city, approaching young people who caught his eye, wanting to photograph them in an uncontrived, natural, positive way.
"The portraits, shot on the streets with natural light, reveal a tender side to a generation so often misrepresented and who face a world in profound flux," says Mahrlein, whose work has just been published.
Julian Mahrlein grew up in Germany but completed his studies in London, receiving his BA in photography from London College of Communication and his MA in art & politics from Goldsmiths.
London Youth by Julian Mahrlein is published by Hoxton Mini Press.
