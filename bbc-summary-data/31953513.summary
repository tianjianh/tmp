[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man who murdered a Lancashire man in a "jealous, frenzied knife attack" at his ex-partner's house has been jailed for life.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Adam Wilson, of Lostock Hall, was found with serious injuries at a property on Albrighton Crescent in Lostock Hall near Preston in September.
Jason Taylor, 21, of Westfield, Lostock Hall denied murder but was found guilty after a trial by jury.
At Preston Court, he was ordered to serve a minimum of 25 years.
Mr Wilson died as a result of catastrophic bleeding from a stab wound in his thigh, the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) said.
Sophie Lorimer from the CPS North West said the "brutal attack" in front of his ex-partner was "purely motivated by jealousy".
"He could not accept that the relationship with his ex-girlfriend was over," she said.
Taylor's girlfriend said he bombarded her with text messages and phone calls which "progressively became more and more abusive".
"The final text he sent to her stated he was giving her one last chance before things turned sour.
"Minutes later he violently broke into her house where Adam Wilson was also present."
Ms Lorimer said Taylor then stabbed Mr Wilson numerous times with a large knife which he had taken with him.
Taylor carried out the "frenzied" knife attack "fully aware" there were two young children also present at the house, she said.
He then fled and hid from police in a neighbouring garden, she added.
Ms Lorimer said Taylor had shown "no remorse" throughout the case in which he claimed he was acting in self-defence.
Det Ch Insp Neil Ashton of Lancashire Police said Taylor's actions were carried out "in anger and jealousy".
He said: "His actions were completely unprecedented and resulted in the needless and very sad loss of a young man's life."
