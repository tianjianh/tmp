[SN]TITLE[SN]
Luton Town 2-0 Cambridge United

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Luton Town moved up to fourth in League Two table after an impressive win over Cambridge United at Kenilworth Road, thanks to a goal from Isaac Vassell and Jordan Cook's late penalty.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A quiet opening half saw Luton's only real chance come when Jack Marriott's shot deflected into Jonathan Smith's path, with keeper Will Norris clearing up, while Conor Newton flashed wide for the visitors.
However, Luton had the lead on 33 minutes from a blistering counter attack as Marriott fed the pacy Vassell who sped clear to beat Norris.
Marriott almost made it 2-0 on the stroke of half time, scuffing straight at Norris, while in the second period, Smith fired wide from distance.
Cambridge then went close, as Newton scooped an excellent chance over from close range, with Luke Berry also missing the target and then James Dunne wide from range.
Town weathered the storm though and had a second goal when Vassell was brought down in the box by Leon Legge on 82 minutes and Cook slotted home the penalty.
The Hatters almost had more in the closing stages too, Lawson D'Ath wide after going clean through and Smith's blast repelled by Norris.
