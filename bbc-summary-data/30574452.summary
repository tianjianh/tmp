A tweet from @TheAnonMessage, whose account has now been suspended, said she had two days to comply.
"You are guilty of misappropriating black culture, insulting peaceful protesters, and making light of Eric Garner's death," the group said.
That was referring to the death of the New York man who was put in a chokehold by a police officer in July.
"You have exactly 48 hours to release a statement apologizing to @AzealiaBanks and the protesters in NYC, " Anonymous continued.
The tweets are part of an online feud between rappers Iggy Azalea and Azealia Banks.
Banks criticised Azalea for not speaking out about the deaths of Mike Brown and Eric Garner.
Michael Brown, 18, was killed by Missouri police officer Darren Wilson on 9 August in the St Louis suburb of Ferguson.
It caused violent protests across the US.
There were also demonstrations after Eric Garner died.
Azalea responded to Banks on Twitter saying: "Try not to judge anothers support or 'lack there of' solely on if they have ranted on twitter about it, thats not right or helpful."
Banks told Hot 97: "I have a problem when you're trying to say that it's hip-hop and you're trying to put it up against black culture."
In response Iggy Azalea hit back on Twitter saying: "Special msg for banks: There are many black artists succeeding in all genres. The reason you haven't is because of your... poor attitude."
A Tribe Called Quest rapper Q-Tip also had a go at Iggy Azalea at the weekend asking her to respect the history of hip-hop.
Writing on Twitter he said: "Now u are fulfilling your dreams ... BUT! You have to take into account the HISTORY as you move underneath the banner of hiphop."
Iggy Azalea has denied making a sex tape.
Porn producer Steven Hirsch claimed in September to have footage of her dancing naked when she was younger.
