Tony Booth, from Moreton, Wirral, made the iconic signs for the Fab Four and other Merseybeat bands in the 1960s.
He died on Wednesday at Wirral's Arrowe Park Hospital after a battle with cancer, his son Lee Booth said.
In recent years, Mr Booth made replicas of the posters for fans and had written a book about them which his son hopes will be "part of his legacy".
Mr Booth was hired by Beatles manager Brian Epstein and started off making "a few posters and show cards for his shops" before moving on to hand-painted concert posters.
In the days before the internet, the posters were the main way of telling fans of upcoming gigs.
Though few of the originals survived, one from 1962 advertising a night with Little Richard and The Beatles in The Tower Ballroom in New Brighton was uncovered during the refurbishment of Bidston train station in 2013.
It is now displayed in the Merseybeat room of The Beatles Story museum in Liverpool's Albert Dock.
In August last year, Mr Booth staged his first exhibition at View Two Gallery on Mathew Street after reproducing 40 of his favourite posters with the same materials he used more than 50 years ago.
One of Mr Booth's last projects was to produce posters for The Cavern club's 60th anniversary celebrations this weekend, which his son said was fitting as "one of the earliest posters" had been for its opening.
"He started his career with The Cavern club and finished his career with The Cavern club", he said.
"I've had posters around me all my life, they're part of Liverpool's history".
