The Welsh Assembly elections: Everything you need to know

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Wednesday marks the first official day of campaigning for the fifth assembly elections, when voters will pick who will be part of a body with more powers than it has had in its 17-year history.

The assembly makes laws in areas including health, education and local government, and the next term will see tax powers put in the hands of ministers for the first time.
But the elections can be confusing.
There is a different system used to elect AMs compared to "first past the post", which is used for Westminster polls.
And like any election, to take part you need to register - and that has changed too.
So what are the key dates for the assembly elections, how do you take part and how do they work?
Much like parliament in Westminster, the assembly shuts shop for a month before the election takes place.
Dissolution is when assembly members cease being AMs - and those who are seeking re-election become candidates.
That starts on 6 April.
Confusingly, the last day of assembly business happened on 16 March, when the ceremonial mace was removed from the Senedd chamber.
The period between dissolution and the election is commonly known as purdah, although the Welsh Government calls it the "pre-election period".
The first minister and his cabinet remain in post until a new government is formed, while the Welsh Government continues to implement policy already laid out.
You've got until 18 April to register, if you have not already. You do not have to take part, but it is a legal requirement that you are registered.
There has been a lot of publicity over how the process to register to vote has changed - it is done individually now, rather than by household.
If you are not already registered to vote with your council, you can do it in English here, or in Welsh here. You may need your national insurance number.
There are also forms to register to vote by post.
The deadline for asking for a postal vote is 19 April - the day after the deadline for registering to vote.
To get a postal vote you need to sign a form and post it. The Electoral Commission - the independent elections watchdog - has a u guide with the form available for download.
A proxy vote is where someone else votes for you in person. You need a reason, which you do not for a postal vote. This can include being on holiday or having a physical condition which means you cannot attend a polling station.
Like a postal vote, you also need to fill in a form and post it back to your local council. Forms can be found here.
The deadline for proxy votes is 26 April.
This is the big day. Polling stations across Wales will be open from 07:00 BST to 22:00.
If you choose to vote in person, you will have to attend a polling station within those times.
Details of which station to go to will be included on a polling card that is sent to the address where you registered.
There are 60 assembly members split into two types - 40 that cover constituencies and 20 that cover regions.
Constituency assembly members serve a smaller area than those elected to serve regions. This is currently exactly the same as the area served by Westminster MPs.
Parties nominate lists of candidates to put to the electorate in the regions. Four AMs in each of the five regions will be elected.
The regions are:
Voters are given two ballot papers for the assembly election.
One ballot allows you to vote for a candidate in your constituency. You vote for a party on a separate ballot paper.
The party vote can be for the same party as the person that you voted for in your constituency, or it can be a different one.
The vote on the second ballot paper helps determine the result of the election of regional AMs, which is explained below.
Counts take place at locations across Wales overnight, with BBC TV, radio and online providing results coverage into Friday morning.
Unlike Westminster, the assembly uses the "additional member system". This was implemented to make the assembly more proportional and means the two different types of AMs are elected in two different ways.
The first past the post principle is used to elect constituency AMs - where the candidate with the largest number of votes gets the seat.
For regional seats it is more complicated.
In simple terms, regional AMs' seats are dished out to the different parties according to:
So if Labour gets a large vote in a region but already has lots of AMs elected there, they will not necessarily pick up any regional seats.
Party lists are nominated in the order that candidates will be elected, if they are successful.
For example, if Joe Bloggs is number one for party X, and Bob Jones is number two, but party X only gets one seat in a region, then only Joe Bloggs is elected.
If they get two, Bob Jones gets a seat too.
The Welsh Government is formed from whatever party or group of parties can get enough support in the Senedd to elect a first minister.
If there is a clear majority for one party or another, that will be obvious by 6 May.
If there is not, then the largest party may try to form a minority government.
That could be possible if the other parties do not try to stop that from happening and form their own coalition, like it was in the last assembly term for Labour.
Parties may also try to negotiate a deal to work together, but that could take some time after the election result to emerge.
Yes there is.
There will be another ballot paper given to you for the election of police and crime commissioners, or PCCs.
PCCs are responsible for how police budgets are spent in force areas, and decide the police precept part of council tax. Although they do not determine how forces operate day to day, they do have the power to hire and fire a chief constable.
PCCs serve a force area - so there is a commissioner for Gwent, one for South Wales and so on.
Voters can pick their first and second choice from the ballot. If a candidate receives more than half of all first choice votes, they are elected immediately.
If this does not happen, all other candidates other than the first and second are eliminated.
Secondary votes for the top two, from those eliminated, are then redistributed. The candidate with the highest combined total of first and second votes will be elected.
