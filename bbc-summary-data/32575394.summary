[SN]TITLE[SN]
Middlesbrough hospital A&E; asked to treat paper cut

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Health bosses on Teesside have urged people not to attend the accident and emergency department unless it is really necessary.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
It follows an increase in pressure at Middlesbrough's James Cook University Hospital - with up to 350 visitors a day, as opposed to an average of 300.
Some had only minor complaints such as coughs or colds - one had a paper cut.
People are being asked to look at other options, such as a walk-in centre, or a local pharmacy.
