Hundreds of people gathered around Castletown harbour to watch brave competitors race their customised bathtubs over a 400m course.
Nick Cain was crowned men's world champion for the third time while Erika Cowen claimed her 16th women's title.
The event has raised more than Â£150,000 for local charities since it began.
Competitors use decorated tin baths like small paddle boats.
