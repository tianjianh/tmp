[SN]TITLE[SN]
Shrewsbury Town 0-4 Cardiff City

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Cardiff City impressed in a new formation under head coach Paul Trollope as they coasted to an easy pre-season friendly win at Shrewsbury.

Anthony Pilkington's excellent curling strike and a header from debutant Frederic Gounongbe gave the dominant visitors a 2-0 half-time lead.
Cardiff made 11 substitutions after an hour and Tom James nodded in from Craig Noone's free-kick.
Kenneth Zohore then seized on a goalkeeping error to complete the rout.
The most useful exercise for recently-appointed Cardiff boss Trollope was arguably the switch to a 5-3-2 formation which had proved so successful for Wales during their run to the semi-finals of Euro 2016.
Trollope has been a part of the Welsh coaching set-up since July 2015, and his Bluebirds players adapted to the system with ease as they monopolised possession and scoring opportunities in an utterly one-sided encounter.
