Seven-year-old Rowan Fitzgerald and Dora Hancox, in her 70s, died when the bus crashed into Sainsbury's on Trinity Street, Coventry, on Saturday evening.
Insp Paul Bennett said about 150 witness statements were being taken and the bus was being examined.
The 77-year-old bus driver, an ex-mayor of Leamington Spa, was "devastated to the core", his family has said.
Rowan was on the top deck of the bus with his eight-year-old cousin, who is in a stable condition in intensive care, police said. She is expected to have an operation on her leg.
Two books of condolences have been opened at the Sainsbury's store to remember Rowan, from Leamington, and Mrs Hancox, from Nuneaton.
Insp Bennett, from West Midlands Police's Collision Investigation Unit, said: "We currently have several officers and specialist staff from partner agencies conducting a thorough examination of the bus, which is being held in a compound."
"Our priority is to ensure that the investigation is comprehensive and thorough to achieve a definitive cause for the collision and this could take several months," he said.
Five other people were treated in hospital, including bus driver Kailash Chander, who has been assisting police with their inquiries. He has not been arrested.
Mrs Hancox was a lollipop lady in Coventry and Nuneaton said her family, who remember her as a mother who dedicated her life to caring for others.
One daughter said: "Our mother will be sadly missed, not only by her family, but by friends as well.
"She will finally be able to be reunited with her husband, our father, who tragically passed away from dementia two years ago.
"This has been a horrible shock to all of us.
"Our mother dedicated many years of her life as a foster carer for Coventry social services."
Another daughter added: "This tragedy has cut short her life at the time she was just starting to live again.
"She will be sadly missed by all and her grandchildren and great-grandchildren will now not have the opportunity to gain memories from getting to know her."
Rowan attended St Anthony's Catholic Primary School, in Leamington, where pupils are being supported by staff, including their school counsellor.
Head teacher Jane McSharry said the death of a friend was a "very big shocking experience for them".
Baldev Singh Sandhar, a friend of Mr Chander, said: "He's very upset. He's shocked. He never likes to see anybody hurt and has always helped other people."
