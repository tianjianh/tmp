Police Commissioner William Bratton has confirmed Detective Joseph Lemm was killed in the Bagram Airfield attack.
A militant riding a motorbike rigged with explosives targeted the group on Monday, killing six and injuring three.
Lemm had been in the US National Guard and deployed twice to Afghanistan and once to Iraq.
He was married with three children and had worked for the New York City Police Department for 15 years.
In New York, he worked in the Bronx warrant squad and was promoted to be a detective last year.
"Detective Joseph Lemm epitomized the selflessness we can only strive for - putting his country and city first... We remember this public servant who dedicated his life to protecting others," said Mr Bratton in a statement.
Lemm is the third NYPD officer to be killed while serving overseas in Iraq or Afghanistan, the New York Daily News reports.
New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said Lemm's death is "horrible news" and it "serves as a painful reminder of the debts we owe to the brave men and women in uniform who put themselves in harm's way... to keep us all safe."
Attacks on foreign troops have risen while troops continue to withdraw from the country.
Though Nato formally ended combat operations last year, 9,800 US troops remain in Afghanistan.
This year to date, 16 US service members have been killed in combat, mostly due to aircraft crashes.
Taliban militants are getting closer to taking the strategically important town of Sangin in southern Afghanistan, reports suggest.
President Barack Obama has said 10,000 service members will remain in Afghanistan through the end of his presidency, reversing an earlier policy.
