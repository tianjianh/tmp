Elsewhere, Dave Lewis replaces Will Chudley at scrum-half, while Moray Low and Harry Williams come into the front row.
Damian Welch and Kai Horstmann are included in the second and back row respectively, with teenage scrum-half Jack Maunder on the bench.
Former Bath player Nick Abendanon starts at full-back for the visitors.
The French side, who finished top of the Top 14 regular-season standings last year, have also named former England and Harlequins winger David Strettle in their starting line-up.
Exeter beat Clermont 31-14 at Sandy Park in the pool stages last season, and director of rugby Rob Baxter says that victory will provide his side with belief.
"It's not something we know we can't achieve," he said.
"You have to fly into your first couple of fixtures and that gives you a chance to be a leader, but if you lose, you are a chaser. We will focus on being a leader after these two rounds."
Exeter have won two of their opening six Premiership fixtures, but after narrow defeats by Wasps and Northampton, as well as last weekend's draw with Gloucester, Baxter believes things could easily be different.
"I'm comfortable with where we are. Had a couple of kicks gone differently we would be sitting near the top of the table and thinking everything is all right," he added.
"However, we still have plenty to work on and it starts this weekend."
Clermont are top of the French league after a 29-22 win over Toulouse last weekend.
Pool Five is completed by Bordeaux-Begles - who Exeter were also drawn against in last year's pool stages - and Ulster.
