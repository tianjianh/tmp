A tight first half saw the hosts open up a 12-3 advantage thanks to four penalties from Lamb, with Charles Bouldoire replying for Stade Rochelais.
The French club improved after the break, but twice gave away possession when five metres from the line.
And the hosts wrapped up the win when Lamb converted Ben Howard's late try after a clever pass from Ravai Fatiaki.
A minute's silence was held just before kick-off following the attacks in Paris on Friday evening, while both sides wore black armbands as a mark of respect.
While Challenge Cup games in France were called off, the visitors agreed that the game should go ahead.
Lamb successfully landed penalties from 40 and 30 metres inside the first nine minutes before Bouldoire's 15-metre kick closed the gap.
The Warriors, who won only once in six Challenge Cup matches last season, edged six points ahead again through Lamb's third penalty.
The visitors had more possession as the half went on, although Bouldoire hit a post with his second attempt, while Lamb took his tally to four from four to put his side nine points ahead at half-time.
Bouldoire drifted a kick at goal wide of the near post after the break and Stade Rochelais twice knocked on when close to the Worcester line.
Just as the second half looked like being scoreless, Fatiaki fed Howard to score and Lamb converted to increase his personal tally.
