Officers found the torso in the case at a shared house in Peterborough just after 12:30 BST on Friday, after other tenants reported a "pungent smell".
Cambridgeshire Police want to find Lithuanian national Vitautas Jokubauskas, 57.
He had been letting the property in Mayor's Walk, they said.
The body has been removed from the house and a post mortem examination is due to take place at Peterborough City Hospital on Monday.
Cambridgeshire Police said the last reported sighting of Mr Jokubauskas was last Saturday, 30 May, when he was taken to work in Huntingdon by a friend.
Det Ch Insp Adam Gallop, said the force had been notified of a "pungent smell and a suspicious suitcase in a separate room".
Fellow tenants were concerned about its contents, he said.
"Forensic police teams attended and made the gruesome discovery," he added.
A police spokesman said the woman's body had yet to be identified but officers were keen to trace a woman, believed to be Mr Jokubauskas' partner.
She is described as being about 40 years old, slim, with black hair and also Lithuanian, he said.
A cordon has been put up in Mayor's Walk and police, including scenes of crime officers, remain at the house.
Det Ch Insp Adam Gallop said: "We are very keen to trace Mr Jokubauskas.
"Investigations are ongoing to determine where this murder took place and our priorities are to locate Mr Jokubauskas and identify the body.
"I would urge anyone who thinks they have seen Mr Jokubauskas or recognises the description of his partner to contact police as soon as possible. Anyone who sees him should not approach him and should contact police immediately."
Det Ch Insp Gallop said the death was being treated as an isolated incident and a dedicated murder team had been set up to investigate.
Anyone with information is asked to call Cambridgeshire Police.
