[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man who admitted taking part in a paramilitary shooting in Belfast has been sentenced to five years in jail and a further five years on licence.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Patrick Joseph O'Neill, of no fixed address, was one of three masked men who forced their way into the victim's home in Ardoyne in November 2010.
The man was shot several times in the legs and groin in front of his mother, who fought back with kitchen knives.
O'Neill was arrested in 2015, when DNA found on her knives was traced to him.
Belfast Crown Court heard that the gun used to shoot the victim at his mother's home in Brompton Park was a Glock pistol that had been stolen during a burglary at a policeman's house in 2006.
At least five shots were discharged, and the injured man has been left in "chronic pain" with permanent scarring.
The dissident republican paramilitary group, Óglaigh na hÉireann, claimed responsibility for the so-called punishment shooting shortly after it took place.
O'Neill admitted his involvement in the gun attack in October this year, but on Monday the judge said it has never been established which of the three men pulled the trigger.
The court was told that 41-year-old O'Neill, who has six children and three grandchildren, has a limited criminal record and had not been associated with any similar offending since the 2010 shooting.
Jailing him, the judge said that despite the seriousness of the offences, he did not consider O'Neill to present a danger to the public.
A previous hearing was told that on the evening of 15 November 2010, the victim's mother tried to defend both her and her son by arming herself with kitchen knives, but the masked gang threatened to shoot her as well.
Investigators recovered a DNA sample from one of her knives and, last year it was matched to O'Neill when he was arrested for a unrelated domestic offence.
While he was awaiting trial, O'Neill had his bail conditions relaxed so he could go to a Belfast music festival, headlined by the band Madness.
Last month, he pleaded guilty to possessing a firearm with intent, and unlawfully and maliciously causing grievous bodily harm, on the grounds of joint enterprise.
The judge accepted there was no evidence to suggest O'Neill was the gunman, but said he would have been "fully aware" of the intent of the masked gunmen.
As he was led from the dock to begin his sentence, O'Neill gave the thumbs up to family and friends in the public gallery.
Following the sentencing, police released a photo of the heavily bloodstained scene of the shooting.
In a statement, PSNI Det Insp Andy Workman said: "The victim sustained serious injuries as a result of this attack.
"It was an example of nameless and faceless individuals using a paramilitary flag of convenience, in this case Óglaigh na hÉireann, to inflict life-changing harm on someone without any reference to a judge, jury or the normal processes of the criminal justice system."
