More than £9.2m was spent by the BBC charity on 159 active projects in every county in Wales last year which helped 20,000 disadvantaged children.
Singer Wynne Evans hosted a night of entertainment and fundraising from Swansea University's Great Hall.
"It's a truly staggering amount," said Jemma Wray, the charity head in Wales.
