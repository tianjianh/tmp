Gulam Bodi: Former South Africa player named in Twenty20 fix probe

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Former South Africa player Gulam Bodi has been charged with match-fixing by the country's national cricket body.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Cricket South Africa says Bodi is the "intermediary" who was charged under its anti-corruption code in December.
The India-born 37-year-old played two one-day internationals and a Twenty20 for the Proteas in 2007.
Bodi, who is yet to respond, is charged with "contriving to fix, or otherwise improperly influence aspects of the 2015 Ram Slam T20 Challenge Series".
A left-arm wrist-spinner, he is also remembered for his part in hastening Kevin Pietersen's move to England.
Bodi was selected by Natal at the expense of Pietersen in 2000.
The future England international credited that decision as being down to racial selection quotas in his native country.
