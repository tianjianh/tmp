Cancer services in Wales are reaching a tipping point and a new plan is needed to cope with growing numbers of people being diagnosed, a charity has said.

Cancer Research UK said some people are waiting too long for test results which determine whether they have cancer.
About 19,000 people a year are diagnosed with cancer in Wales, a rise of about 14% in the decade to 2014.
A Welsh Government spokesman said an updated cancer delivery plan would be published in November.
The charity's chief executive, Sir Harpal Kumar, said: "This report paints a worrying picture, from cancer experts, of NHS cancer services in Wales reaching a tipping point.
"Whilst there have been notable improvements in cancer care, with more people surviving than ever before, we are a long way from where we should be."
Cancer Research UK's report said treatment waiting times were a "critical issue" which needed urgent attention.
Researchers also found the availability of modern radiotherapy treatment was patchy and access often determined by where a patient lives in Wales.
The Welsh Government spokesman said: "We are pleased Cancer Research UK recognises the huge strides made in cancer care in Wales.
"There are now more people than ever before surviving cancer and we are committed to building on this progress."
