One of Scotland's longest married couples say they have had their arguments but nothing serious enough to interrupt 70 years of marriage.

Hugh and Meg Ross, who live in a Ach an Eas care home in Inverness, have received a card from the Queen to mark their platinum wedding anniversary.
The pair met when Mr Ross visited the shop where Mrs Ross worked to ask about an edition of Wireless World magazine.
Mrs Ross, 88, said she and her husband were "perfect lovers".
Her 90-year-old husband said: "I picked this girl and I got her, and I've stood by her ever since. That's the secret.
"We have our arguments but we never allow them to get to a break-up situation."
Mrs Ross added: "We can have arguments but do not get into anything serious. We are perfect lovers."
The couple who met during World War Two were married in July 1946.
At that time Mr Ross was a fireman working on steam locomotives.
He had started his career on the railways as an engine cleaner and later became an engine driver on diesel locomotives, writing a handbook on how to operate them.
Called The Rules, it was sought after by other drivers to help them pass their exams.
Mrs Ross started work when she was 13-years-old at Corries the Chemist on Drummond Street in Inverness, before she got the job in the newsagents where she first met Mr Ross.
The couple have six children - four daughters and two sons - and 10 grandchildren and seven great grandchildren.
Their family, friends and other residents of the NHS Highland-run care home joined the pair for a party held to celebrate their wedding anniversary.
