[SN]TITLE[SN]
Solihull Moors 2-3 Macclesfield Town

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Ollie Norburn's last-gasp goal saw Macclesfield end Solihull's unbeaten home run with a thrilling victory which featured three penalties in the space of seven minutes.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Shep Murombedzi's 25-yard deflected effort put the hosts into the lead midway through the opening half, but the goalscorer then brought down Danny Rowe in the box and Kingsley James converted from the spot.
Solihull were then handed a spot-kick of their own on the stroke of half-time when the visitors were penalised for tugging, and Akwasi Asante slotted home from 12 yards.
James took his goal tally for the season to four with his second penalty three minutes after half-time.
He was tripped in the box by Jamie Osborne but picked himself up to level the scores before Norburn won it at the death.
