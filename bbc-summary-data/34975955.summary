Most Northern Ireland MPs to support David Cameron on Syria

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
As the House of Commons prepares to vote on David Cameron's call for air strikes against IS held territory in Syria, it looks like a majority of Northern Ireland MPs will back the prime minister.

The DUP, which has eight MPs, has said it "will have further discussions with the government and will need to see the motion which will be voted on".
The party said its deputy leader Nigel Dodds has "consistently said there needs to be a plan with a clear exit strategy".
However, Mr Dodds has previously been quoted as stating "we have always said we can back British military force, provided it is realistic and in the national interest. The scene is set for our action being just that."
In the Commons last week, Mr Dodds went even further in indicating his party's support for air strikes. The North Belfast MP warned against "the consequences of appeasing and indulging terrorism".
He said that for the DUP "the important issues are an effective overall strategy, the targeting of terrorists, and that there is an end point.
"We stand ready to do what is in the best interests of our national security. If it protects our people, here and abroad, we must act."
In August 2013, the DUP opposed Mr Cameron's plan to launch air strikes against President Assad.
One factor in the party's thinking was the position of Christian groups in Syria - the DUP had been lobbied by Christian groups who regarded Assad as the lesser of two evils.
However, that argument doesn't apply to attacks on IS.
At the recent DUP annual conference, East Belfast MP Gavin Robinson again emphasised the need for the protection of Christian minorities in Syria.
As well as the backing of the DUP's eight MPs, Mr Cameron is likely to enjoy the support of the two Ulster Unionist MPs.
Fermanagh MP Tom Elliott is a former Ulster Defence Regiment Soldier, while South Antrim MP Danny Kinahan was a captain in the Blues and Royals Regiment.
Last week, Mr Kinahan told the Commons "we want to see Daesh totally defeated" before arguing for the better distribution of humanitarian aid in the area.
By contrast with the two main unionist parties, the three SDLP MPs seem certain to oppose any air strikes.
Back in September 2014, the SDLP voted against the RAF participating in strikes against IS in Iraq, even though military support had been requested by the Iraqi government.
Last week, Foyle MP Mark Durkan said many of the arguments against intervening as an ally of President Assad also applied to David Cameron's latest proposal.
Mr Durkan warned MPs against feeding "the evil we want to defeat".
Like the SDLP, Sinn FÃ©in is opposed to the air strikes. However the party's four MPs don't take their seats in the Commons so won't participate in this week's vote.
It is understood the North Down Independent Unionist MP, Lady Sylvia Hermon, is still undecided and will make her mind up after listening to the full debate in the Commons.
Lady Hermon voted in favour of the Iraq war back in 2003, but voted against the proposed air strikes on President Assad in in August 2013.
The North  Down MP didn't vote when the Commons divided on air strikes against IS inside Iraq in September 201
Earlier this year, Lady Hermon expressed her concern about the plight of refugees fleeing the war in Syria and commended volunteers in her constituency who had collected clothing, shoes and other goods to help refugees in the camps at Calais.
