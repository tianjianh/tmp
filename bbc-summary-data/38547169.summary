[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Police were inundated with reports of people having their windows smashed and tyres slashed in Leicester and villages in the Wreake Valley.
Detectives, who said nothing was stolen from the vehicles, have appealed for more people to report Monday's damage.
The men, aged 18, 19, 20, 21 and 23, were arrested on suspicion of criminal damage but have since been bailed.
Milkman Tony Fowler, who was one of the first people on the scene, said: "It was just pure mindless, senseless destruction.
"I've never seen so many [cars damaged] in such a short space of time."
Reports were made in areas including Leicester, Glenfield, Thurmaston, East Goscote, Rearsby, Frisby on the Wreake, Saxelby and Waltham on the Wolds.
