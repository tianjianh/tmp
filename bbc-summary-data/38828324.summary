In the wild, cats have to be active to eat, because they hunt for their food, and they eat little and often.
But most cats who are kept as pets get given a couple of big meals each day without them needing to work for it.
Experts say cats aren't designed for that pampered lifestyle, and their owners should try feeding them in a way that's more like how they eat in the wild.
The new research and plan were created by International Cat Care as part of The Big Bang Fair.
Colin the cat has been trying it out and his owner says it's going pretty well!
