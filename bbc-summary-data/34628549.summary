The arch-rivals have yet to agree the first of six proposed series between 2015 and 2023.
Talks were disrupted after far-right Hindu nationalists attacked Board of Control for Cricket in India offices, protesting against games with Pakistan.
The Pakistan Cricket Board warned their government "will say don't go" if India do not agree to a series this winter.
The 2016 World Twenty20 is due to be held in India in March and April.
India and Pakistan have not played a bilateral Test series since 2007 after New Delhi stalled the ties in the aftermath of terrorist attacks on Mumbai in 2008, blamed on militants based across the border.
India were due to play two Tests, five one-day internationals and two Twenty20 internationals this year in the United Arab Emirates, where Pakistan play their home Tests because of security concerns in their own country.
In addition to talks being scrapped, Pakistani umpire Aleem Dar was withdrawn from India's home series with South Africa by the International Cricket Council (ICC).
