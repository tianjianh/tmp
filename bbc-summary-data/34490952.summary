South Wales, Gwent, Dyfed-Powys and North Wales Police forces have joined together with councils to encourage people to report incidents.
All Wales Hate Crime Awareness Week has been launched by the Welsh government.
A hate crime is a crime against an individual or group of people based on their identity.
Victims can be targeted for a disability, their race or ethnicity, religion, transgender identity or sexual orientation.
South Wales Police Assistant Chief Constable Jon Stratford said: "Reports of hate crime to us have increased, which we believe is an indication that individuals feel more confident about reporting such incidents to us.
"However we know that hate crime is significantly under reported and that is the main focus of this year's campaign.
"There are a number of reasons why this type of crime goes unreported - from fear of reprisals, a lack of confidence in the system, or even a lack of understanding that a crime has been committed.
"This campaign will hopefully focus people's minds on what a hate crime is and how they, as a fellow citizen, need to speak up and report this kind of behaviour."
The All Wales Hate Crime Awareness Week runs from 10 to 17 October.
