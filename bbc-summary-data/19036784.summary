The star was held at Kjevik Airport while on his way to a music festival, when customs officials found he was carrying eight grams of the drug.
The 40-year-old's lawyer said the rapper had no immediate plans to appeal against the ban.
His client could "live with the decision", he added.
Snoop, whose real name is Calvin Broadus, was also found at the time to be carrying more cash than is legally allowed in Norway and was fined 52,000 kroner (??5,500) after admitting the two offences.
He went on to perform at Norway's Hove Festival.
In January, Snoop was arrested in Texas after border agents found cannabis on his tour bus. He was later released with a caution.
The rapper is currently on tour and is expected to appear at the Catalpa Festival in New York on Sunday.
