He takes the top spot from brothers Sri and Gopi Hinduja, now worth £13bn.
The total wealth of the richest 1,000 individuals and families in Britain has more than doubled in the last 10 years to £547bn, the survey reported.
The Queen, who topped the first list in 1989, has dropped out of the top 300 for the first time.
There are now 117 billionaires on the list, up from 104 in 2014, with 80 of them living in London.
Mr Blavatnik, who was born in Odessa in the then Soviet Union and became a US citizen in the 1980s, has investments that range from metals and oil to music publishing and digital media. He owns a £41m home in London and has donated £75m to Oxford University to found the Blavatnik School of Government.
The highest risers in terms of wealth are the retail family headed by Galen and George Weston, who run Selfridges and Primark in the UK.
Their fortune has grown by £3.7bn - more than 50% in a year - to £11bn.
Chelsea Football Club owner Roman Abramovich comes in at number 10 on the list with a fortune of £7.29bn, down £1.23bn on last year, while Virgin boss Sir Richard Branson has seen his wealth rise from £3.6bn to £4.1bn, making him 20th richest in Britain.
A personal fortune of £100m is now required to become one of the 1,000 richest people in the country, up £15m compared with last year's entry point of £85m.
In 1997 it took a fortune of just £15m to join Britain's richest 1,000 people.
