Hollywood star Shia LaBeouf has been arrested and charged with public drunkenness, police in Texas say.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Police arrested the actor on Friday night on Sixth Street in Austin's entertainment district.
The actor has had numerous brushes with the law throughout his career.
Witnesses said LaBeouf initially caused a disturbance on Friday after being refused a drink at a bar, and later jaywalked in front of police.
Officers are reported to have subdued him and put him in handcuffs before arresting him, the TMZ website reported.
Jail records quoted by the AP news agency say that he spent Friday night in the Travis County Jail and has now been released.
In September 2014, he pleaded guilty to a charge of disorderly conduct over his disruption of a Broadway performance of Cabaret.
He was also arrested after a fight in a bar in Los Angeles in 2011, although he was later released without charge.
Shortly before that arrest, a publicist for the actor said that he was receiving treatment for alcoholism.
There have also been a series of instances where LaBeouf is said to have behaved erratically in public - on one occasion appearing on the red carpet with a paper bag on his head, on which was written: "I am not famous anymore."
LaBeouf - who also writes screenplays - found fame at age 14 as the star of the Disney series Even Stevens and has also starred in three Transformers films.
The star's movies include Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull and Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps.
