New Zealand's Mitchell McClenaghan will have surgery on a fractured eye socket after being hit by the ball in a one-day international win over Pakistan.

The 29-year-old left-arm paceman was struck in the left eye while batting, after Anwar Ali's delivery went through the grille of his helmet.
"Everything is as good as it can be," said McClenaghan on Twitter. "Just a few broken bones."
McClenaghan was recently re-signed by Middlesex as their overseas player.
The part-time model, who has played 48 ODIs and 24 Twenty20 internationals for the Black Caps, will now miss the remainder of the three-game ODI series against Pakistan.
Former England wicketkeeper Craig Kieswetter retired in 2015 after breaking his nose and damaging both his eye socket and cheekbone while batting 12 months earlier.
New Zealand beat Pakistan by 70 runs in the first ODI in Wellington.
