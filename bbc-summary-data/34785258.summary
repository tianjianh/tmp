A two-minute silence at 11:00 GMT was observed to commemorate the dead of two world wars, and every conflict since.
Later on Wednesday, Parliament Buildings will be floodlit in red for the first time to mark Armistice Day.
Lord Mayor of Belfast Arder Carson said the ceremony of remembrance at the Cenotaph at Belfast City Hall had been "poignant and emotional".
"I am here today in respect and remembrance of all those who died in the First World War, nationalist and unionist both," the Sinn Féin councillor added.
Democratic Unionist Party councillor Guy Spence, Belfast's deputy lord mayor, said the city had "united to respect the fallen".
He added: "My father was a veteran of the armed forces, so it's an emotional day for us all and certainly one we're proud to be a part of."
Northern Ireland Secretary Theresa Villiers joined MLAs for a remembrance service at Stormont, led by Sinn Féin's Mitchel McLaughlin, the assembly speaker.
Lighting Stormont's Parliament Buildings red later on Wednesday would be "an important initiative", Mr McLaughlin said.
Armistice Day is one of four days the Assembly Commission has elected for Parliament Buildings to be illuminated during the year.
Earlier, Mr McLaughlin said remembrance "should be a unifying, not a divisive concept".
"My involvement in First World War commemorations over this last year has only underlined to me the importance that the assembly should remember and show respect to the fallen."
In the Republic of Ireland, a remembrance service and parade was held at Glasnevin cemetery in Dublin.
Plaques were unveiled at the cemetery to honour Irish recipients of the Victoria Cross, the highest British military honour for gallantry.
A new exhibition on unionist and nationalist soldiers from Northern Ireland who fought together in WW1 was opened at the cemetery museum after the commemoration.
