[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The fire, in the Drumcor Road area, was reported at about 20:15 BST on Saturday 18 April.
Police said it was being linked to a suspicious object that was found in the Clabby Road area the previous day. It turned out to be harmless.
They said they would be increasing patrols in the area.
Detectives have appealed for anyone with information about the incidents to contact Enniskillen Police Station on the non-emergency number 101, or Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
It is understood the fire was in a shed on land owned by relatives of a family named in a BBC Scotland documentary last week into dog breeding.
