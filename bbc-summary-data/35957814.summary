Johanna Konta climbs to career-high 21st in world rankings

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
British number one Johanna Konta has moved up two places to a career high of 21st in the WTA world rankings.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Heather Watson, the British number two, has moved up 14 places from 69 to 55, while British number three Naomi Broady is up two places to 78.
Konta was most recently in action at the Miami Open, where she became the first British woman to make the last eight but lost to Victoria Azarenka.
This time last year the Australia-born 24-year-old was the world number 151.
But a remarkable 12 months during which she reached the Australia Open semi-finals has seen her move to within touching distance of breaking into the top 20.
