Ivorian Bony, 27, has made 15 league starts since joining City for Â£28m from Swansea in January 2015, but had not featured under new boss Pep Guardiola.
The Potters have also signed Porto and Netherlands defender Bruno Martins Indi, 24, on loan for the season with a view to a permanent deal.
Derby goalkeeper Lee Grant, 33, has joined on loan until January.
Stoke have also signed 17-year-old defender Cameron McJannett from Luton for an undisclosed fee.
Meanwhile, defender Philipp Wollscheid has left the club to join Bundesliga side Wolfsburg on a season-long loan and 26-year-old forward Joselu has joined Spanish side Deportivo la Coruna on a similar deal.
"Bringing Wilfried in was a no-brainer for us," Potters manager  Mark Hughes said. "He has power, speed and very good physical attributes."
Stoke targeted Ivory Coast international Bony as there had been no development in their attempt to sign West Brom forward Saido Berahino.
Last week, West Ham United manager Slaven Bilic said he was interested in signing Bony, who has three years left to run on his contract at Etihad Stadium.
