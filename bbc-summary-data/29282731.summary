[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Two detectives from Sussex Police who dealt with a sex crime allegation against Jimmy Savile have been served with gross misconduct notices.

The Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) said the two officers under investigation were a detective sergeant and detective constable.
The pair investigated a sexual offence complaint against Savile by a woman who contacted the force in March 2008.
The allegation dated back to an alleged assault in the 1970s.
The IPCC also said two other Sussex officers, who were in a supervisory role in 2008, had been served with misconduct notices.
The Sussex officers investigated the woman's claim that Savile assaulted her in a caravan when she was in her early 20s.
This was referred to prosecutors, along with three other allegations against the performer received by Surrey Police, but in 2009 the Crown Prosecution Service decided no action could be taken.
IPCC deputy chairwoman, Sarah Green, who is overseeing the Savile investigations, said: "The investigation is examining interactions between Sussex Police officers and the victim and whether all lines of enquiry were properly pursued."
Investigators have taken a statement from the woman who reported the assault and expect to interview the four officers soon. A number of Sussex Police policy documents are being examined.
In November the IPCC directed Sussex Police to refer the conduct of the two officers.
The former presenter of BBC's Top Of The Pops and Jim'll Fix It, who also worked as a Radio 1 DJ and received a knighthood in 1990, died aged 84 in October 2011 - a year before the allegations emerged in an ITV documentary.
