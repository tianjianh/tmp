Rugby union's Keelan Giles, Paralympic swimmer Ellie Robinson and gymnast Amy Tinkler make up the final trio from 10 nominated athletes.
The winner will be presented with their award on BBC One's The One Show on Wednesday, 14 December (19:00 GMT).
They will follow in the footsteps of past winners, such as Wayne Rooney, Andy Murray and Ellie Downie.
The top three were picked from an original list of 10, which included Downie (gymnastics), Sophie Ecclestone (cricket), Tom Hamer (Para-swimming), Lauren Rowles (Para-rowing), Georgia Stanway (football), Jess Stretton (Para-archery) and Rebekah Tiler (weightlifting).
In Keelan Giles' first four games for Pro 12 side Ospreys, he scored eight tries, including a hat-trick away to Lyon in the European Challenge Cup.
Ospreys coach Steve Tandy has described the 18-year-old as an "unbelievable finisher" and he has been compared to Wales' record try scorer Shane Williams.
Keelan was called up to Rob Howley's senior Wales squad for the autumn internationals and was one of the stars of Wales' Under-20 Six Nations Grand Slam campaign.
Swimmer Ellie Robinson broke the Paralympic record to win gold in the 50m butterfly at the Rio Games.
The 15-year-old also won bronze in the 100m freestyle, breaking a British record in the process, and has been described as a "great role model to both able-bodied and Para-athletes".
Earlier in the year, at the IPC European Championships, she brought back one silver (50m butterfly) and three bronze medals (50m, 100m and 400m freestyle).
Sixteen-year-old Amy Tinkler gave the performance of her life to take bronze on the floor at the Rio 2016 Olympics, becoming the first female British gymnast to win a medal in the event.
She was the youngest member of Team GB in Rio, and only the second British woman to win an individual artistic gymnastics medal, after Beth Tweddle's bronze in the uneven bars in 2012.
Tinkler also retained her floor title at the British Championships, winning gold for the second year in a row.
This award goes to the outstanding young sportsperson aged 17 or under on 1 January 2016, selected from nominations made to the BBC and by sports governing bodies via the Youth Sport Trust and in partnership with Blue Peter. Nominations closed on 11 November 2016.
