Civilian police workers in England and Wales will stage a 24-hour strike on 22 December, the Unison union has said.

Earlier this month, members including police community support officers (PCSOs) backed action in protest over a 1% pay offer. They are calling for a 3% wage increase.
It will be the first pay strike by police civilian workers for 25 years.
Unison said members would hold four weeks of industrial action short of a strike after 22 December.
Unison general secretary Dave Prentis said: "Police staff have been hit hard by the cost-of-living crisis. Since 2010, two years of pay freeze and a below-inflation pay deal last year has seen the value of their pay decline by 13%.
"It is rare for police staff to take industrial action and the strike is a clear sign that they've had enough."
He urged employers to return to the negotiating table, adding: "Police staff have had a raw deal. All we're asking for is fair pay. Our members' contribution to community safety is immense and it needs to be reflected in their pay."
Unison represents some 30,000 police staff in England and Wales.
