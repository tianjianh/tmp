Notts County Ladies have signed Arsenal winger Rachel Yankey on an initial 66-day loan, to add to the arrivals of defenders Aivi Luik and Chelsea Weston.

Yankey, 36, is one of England's most-capped players with 129 appearances and has been with Arsenal for 11 years.
"Everyone in and around the game is more than aware of the devastating effect she can have on a game," manager Rick Passmoor told the club website.
Arsenal allowed Yankey to leave after signing Nigeria forward Asisat Oshoala.
Australia international defender Luik, 31, signed a two-year deal while ex-Birmingham City and Doncaster Belles defender Weston, 26, also agreed a contract with the Lady Pies.
Luik won the W-League title with Melbourne this season and has also played for Brisbane Roar, as well as Danish side Brondby.
"Aivi has a wealth of experience, something which will only help our younger defenders," Passmoor added. "Chelsea has great experience in the WSL, having been an ever-present in the league over the seasons."
Another of their pre-season signings, Natasha Flint, left the Women's Super League One club earlier this week.
