The would-be thieves - four men dressed in black - struck at a service station in East Delph, Whittlesey at 02:55 BST.
Cambridgeshire Police said the cash machine was left at the scene and it was not clear whether cash or anything else was stolen.
Fire crews closed the petrol station on safety grounds.
Two other trucks were also used in the raid.
A red car - possibly an Audi - was seen leaving in the direction of the Dog In A Doublet pub and Thorney, Cambridgeshire Police said.
On Saturday, a JCB was used to steal a cash machine from a newsagent's in Harlow in Essex.
A police spokesman said it was "too early to say whether it [the Whittlesey raid] is being linked to others, but we are keeping an open mind".
