Residents in Greater Manchester will choose their first directly-elected mayor next year, the government has confirmed.

The role is part of a devolution deal, giving local politicians control over Â£2bn of public money.
The government said the mayor would provide the "local accountability needed with the new powers being devolved".
The election will take place on 4 May 2017 and then every four years.
The mayor will lead the Greater Manchester Combined Authority, made up of the area's 10 local council leaders, which will control budgets for areas such as transport, skills and housing.
Police and Crime Commissioner Tony Lloyd has taken on the role of interim mayor until the election.
Greater Manchester's devolution deal - part of the government's Northern Powerhouse programme - was the first to be agreed in England.
The region also became the first to get full control of its health and social care budget in April 2015.
