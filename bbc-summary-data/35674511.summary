Serge Aurier: Paris St-Germain right-back to train with reserves

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Paris St-Germain have ordered right-back Serge Aurier to train with the reserve team for the next month for making homophobic comments about boss Laurent Blanc in an online video.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Ivory Coast international has been suspended by the club for the past two weeks after insulting Blanc and team-mates on social media app Periscope.
He will have to join PSG's second string, who play in the third tier, from 29 February until 20 March.
Aurier can then rejoin the senior team.
PSG are 24 points clear at the top of Ligue 1 in their quest for a fourth consecutive title.
They go to Lyon on Sunday (20:00 GMT).
