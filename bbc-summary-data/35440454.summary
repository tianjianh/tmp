The Leicester Riders faced the Surrey Scorchers at the Leicester Community Sports Arena in the BBL Trophy quarter-final on Saturday evening.
All 2,400 seats in the Riders' new Â£4.8m home sold out inside six days.
The Riders won the game 77-60 to advance to the semi-finals of the BBL Trophy, led by a 14-point game from forward Drew Sullivan.
Managing director Russell Levenston called the club's new arena "a game changer".
"We always knew there would be a good response, but we sold 2,400 tickets in six days and we probably could have sold another 1,000 tickets," he said.
"One of the things that British basketball hasn't had for many years is access to facilities - and clubs having their own home.
"Now we have somewhere we can call home and that is going to be the game changer for us."
The arena will also be home to the Leicester Cobras Wheelchair Basketball Team and will be used by Leicester College as part of its teaching and learning sports programme.
Leicester Riders, founded in 1967, is the oldest professional club in British basketball.
It is estimated the 2,400-seat venue will allow the Riders to treble their income.
The team spent 16 years looking to find a new home after Granby Halls in Leicester was demolished.
