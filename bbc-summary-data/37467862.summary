[SN]TITLE[SN]
Valencia 0-2 Atletico Madrid

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Valencia keeper Diego Alves saved two penalties to extend his La Liga record but could not prevent defeat by Atletico Madrid at the Mestalla.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Alves took his tally of penalty saves to 19 by denying Antoine Griezmann and Gabi either side of the interval.
Griezmann made amends in the 63rd minute as Kevin Gameiro pounced on a rebound to pull back for the France international to score.
Gameiro added a second late on, cutting inside to finish low under Alves.
The hosts threatened before Gameiro's strike as Eliaquim Mangala headed straight at Atletico keeper Jan Oblak when unmarked in the final stages.
But despite the efforts of Alves, who broke the all-time La Liga penalty-saving record last week against Leganes, the hosts could not force a result in front of new boss Cesare Prandelli, sitting in the stands before he officially takes over on Monday.
Victory took Atletico to the top of La Liga, ahead of Real Madrid who were held to a 1-1 draw at home by Eibar.
Barcelona could finish the weekend as leaders depending on their result against Celta Vigo later on Sunday.
