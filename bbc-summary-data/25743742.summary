[SN]TITLE[SN]
Stirling Labour MP Anne McGuire to stand down

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Anne McGuire, the MP for Stirling, has said that she will stand down at the next general election in 2015.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Labour politician was first elected to the seat in 1997 when she beat then Scottish Secretary Michael Forsyth.
Mrs McGuire said she felt she had "played her part" in working for the people of Stirling and that it was time for someone else to take on the role.
Labour leader Ed Miliband paid tribute to Mrs McGuire, and said parliament would be poorer without her.
After winning the seat in 1997, Mrs McGuire served as a Parliamentary Private Secretary to Mr Miliband and the late Scottish Secretary Donald Dewar.
Between 2005 and 2008 she became minister for disabled people in the Department of Work and Pensions (DWP).
However, following Labour's defeat at the 2010 election, she joined the DWP shadow team, shadowing the disabilities portfolio, before resigning from the front bench last year.
'Active MP'
Mrs McGuire said: "I have been pleased to represent the people of Stirling and its communities since the General Election in May 1997 and to continue that representation in the three subsequent elections in 2001, 2005 and 2010.
"However, I feel that I have played my part in working for the people of Stirling and that the time is right for another to take on that role."
Mrs McGuire said that she would continue to be a full-time and active MP until the next general election, adding: "When I hope to hand over to another Labour MP representing a constituency in a country which I hope remains part of the United Kingdom."
Mr Miliband said: "Anne is a dedicated representative of the people of Stirling, a passionate campaigner and, on a personal note, a good friend. Parliament will be poorer without her.
"Anne's career in the voluntary sector prior to her election to parliament ensured that she had the necessary qualities to hold the post of Minister for Disabled People, a post which saw her dedicate herself to help improve the lives of some of society's most disadvantaged."
He added: "I know that she will continue to a champion of social justice for many years to come."
Mrs McGuire's majority at the 2010 election was 8,354.
