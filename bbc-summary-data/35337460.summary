Elland Bridge, in Calderdale, West Yorkshire, partially collapsed on 29 December.
A further £500,000 will help pay for an interim footbridge across the Calder and Hebble Navigation
Calderdale Council said the footbridge was expected to be in place by the end of the week.
The footbridge, 98ft (30m) long and 4 ft 11 in (1.5m) wide, will run between Park Road and Elland Bridge Road.
The Yorkshire MP and government flood envoy for the region, Robert Goodwill, said: " A good local transport system is the lifeblood of the region, and key to a thriving economy.
"This is an important step in keeping the recovery effort on track in Yorkshire."
Tim Swift, the leader of Calderdale Council, said Elland Bridge was of strategic importance to the local community, for local businesses and for tourism.
He said work was being done as "quickly as possible" to the get the footbridge open.
