Adam Wheater's career-best unbeaten 204 ensured Hampshire remained on top against Warwickshire at Edgbaston.

The wicketkeeper, who was dropped two Championship matches ago, hit 27 fours and three sixes en route to his maiden double century off 226 balls.
On a flat pitch, Hampshire inexplicably lost their final five wickets for nine runs as they were bowled out for 531.
The hosts then fell to 11-2, but Jonathan Trott's 59 not out, helped them to 131-3 at the close.
Resuming on 89, Wheater played and missed at a fuller Rikki Clarke delivery in the first over of the day but it was to be his only false shot of the innings.
Wheater's redemption, following criticism from coach Dale Benkenstien about his energy levels behind the stumps this season, came full circle as the 26-year-old played with guile, precision and tidy feet to move past three figures.
Assisted by nightwatchman Mason Crane (22) and Sean Ervine (75), Wheater accelerated - taking just 79 balls to move from 100 to 200.
Warwickshire captain Ian Bell's decision to then bring back Josh Poysden proved to be a good one, as the young leg-spinner wrapped up the tail to finish with a career best 4-85.
The hosts response began badly as Andrew Umeed left a straight one from Gareth Andrew and was bowled for nought before fellow opening bowler Gareth Berg sent Bell's stumps flying.
Trott though remained untroubled as he reached his fifth half-century of the season to keep the hosts in the game.
Warwickshire spinner Josh Poysden told BBC WM:
"Losing Boyd Rankin through injury was tough but, even when Hampshire were going well, we kept going and to get the last five wickets for nine runs was really nice, as we finally got what we deserved.
"On days one and two in first-class cricket you are not really expecting it to spin so I knew they were going to come quite hard at me when I bowled. But that gives me a chance to get wickets so I never mind that.
"You are not going to win every toss in cricket and sometimes you are put in hard situations and that is when you show your character. At Guildford last week everything went in our favour. Now we have got the other side of the coin."
Hampshire's double centurion Adam Wheater told BBC Solent:
"It helped that they had a depleted attack and a lot of overs in the bowlers' legs but it was nice to keep going whereas in previous years I might have had some fun a little bit earlier.
"Being in Division One you know there could be a couple of low scores just around the corner so it was good to cash in. There have been a few doubles around this year and it's nice to be in that bracket.
"When I was on 164 Sean Ervine asked me what my highest score was and I said: 'This is it now'. Then I got a single so that was nice."
