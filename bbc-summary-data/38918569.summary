Millions of people have "signed" online petitions calling on Parliament to do everything from bring in rules for a second EU referendum to introducing a Meningitis B vaccine for all children.

BBC England's data unit found there were 17 parts of the UK where the number of people taking part was consistently higher than elsewhere.
Eight of the 17 were London constituencies. All but two have Labour MPs.
The constituencies, and the party of their MP, were:
Some critics of petitions suggest they are in danger of becoming symbols of protest rather than effective instruments of change.
Stephen Coleman, professor of political communication at the University of Leeds, said: "We should be very concerned about how representative these petitions are.
"If they are only empowering the usual people who vote and participate in other ways, they will exacerbate the gap between the political efficacy of the already active and the limited influence of the least confident."
But Darren Hughes, deputy chief executive of the Electoral Reform Society, said petitions were an effective way of engaging with people who would not normally be interested in politics.
"The more ways to engage the better, and while there always going to be places that sign petitions more than others, that's normal, and millions of people are using this tool right across the county," he said.
"What would be a positive change would be for these petitions to encourage some further engagement - if the site asked them to register to vote, get more involved in politics, and follow more closely the work of Parliament."
We focussed on the top ten most popular petitions.
The same 17 constituencies were in the top 10% of signatures in six of the most popular petitions since Parliament launched a website in July 2015.
Where they were not in the top 10, it was mainly because the other petitions were calling for the opposite of the other petitions they had signed.
For the most popular Parliament petition of all time, calling for a second referendum on leaving the European Union, 17 of the 65 constituencies that signed it the most were also in the top 10% for:

However, they were not in the top 10% for petitions calling for:
Taking the most popular petitions, Brighton Pavilion, represented by Green MP Caroline Lucas, has the highest median rate of signatures as a % of its population.
BBC News found no correlation between the proportion of people signing petitions and turnout in the 2015 General Election.
Northern Ireland constituencies made up the majority of the 10 constituencies with the lowest rates of signing petitions. They included three of the four Sinn FÃ©in MPs, who do not take their seats in the House of Commons.
The other Sinn FÃ©in constituency, Belfast West, comes 601st out of 650 areas for signing petitions.
Brie Rogers Lowery, UK director of campaign website Change.org, said  online petitions would play a prominent role in shaping local, national and global politics.
"This is how society expresses its views in the 21st Century and it's important that politicians engage with them meaningfully," she said.
MPs are debating the two petitions about the US President's visit at 16:30 GMT.
