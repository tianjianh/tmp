Nigel Farage has said he does not want a peerage "at this moment" - but joked that "he might think about it".

The UKIP leader has been mentioned as a possible "go-between" between the UK and US President-elect Donald Trump because of their friendship.
And speculation grew he could secure the role and a place in the House of Lords when Prime Minister Theresa May refused to deny talks had taken place.
But Mr Farage said "it's not going to happen", at least in the near future.
Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Any Questions programme, he said there was more chance of him going into the jungle on ITV's I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out of Here than becoming a member of the House of Lords.
When asked if he would accept a peerage, the MEP said: "A) it's not going to happen and B) it's not what I want in my life at this moment in time.
"When I'm old, you know, I might think about it."
Mr Farage was the first politician from the UK to meet with President-elect Trump after his surprise victory in last week's US election.
He campaigned alongside Mr Trump in the race for the White House and said the businessman was willing to be "very close partners" with the UK.
The incoming US president has spoken to Mrs May by phone and there have been other contacts between ministers and representatives of the incoming administration.
Mrs May declined to rule out the idea of a peerage for Mr Farage when it was put to her during Prime Minister's Questions.
SNP MP George Kerevan asked Mrs May whether there had been any "official conversations" about giving Mr Farage a peerage.
As MPs laughed at the question, the prime minister replied: "All I can say to him, I'm afraid, is that such matters are normally never discussed in public."
