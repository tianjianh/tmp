Phillip Monk, 61, inappropriately touched girls aged between seven and eight while working at Maesybryn Primary School, near Pontypridd, Newport Crown Court was told.
Mr Monk denies 23 counts of indecent assault of a person under the age of 14.
The offences date from 1984 to 1995 and the trial continues.
On Monday the court was told Mr Monk, of Penycoedcae, Pontypridd, molested the girls - three of whom were in the same class at the Llantwit Fardre school - when they came to his desk to have their project work marked.
Prosecutor Suzanne Thomas said of one alleged victim: "He would put his hand up her skirt on a regular basis.
"It would happen whenever she was having work marked by Mr Monk."
The court heard that the victim recalled two further incidents which took place outside the classroom.
Miss Thomas said: "First was an occasion when he took the children to the local community centre to plant oak trees. He had his hand up her skirt as they walked around."
She said that the girl remembered being intimately touched during swimming lessons when Mr Monk would hold her in the water.
"This was making her feel special she thought she was one of his favourites," added Miss Thomas.
"It was only when looking back as an adult she realised what he had done wasn't right."
