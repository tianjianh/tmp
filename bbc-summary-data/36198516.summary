Atletico Madrid boss Diego Simeone says his side's "thrilling" Champions League semi-final success over Bayern Munich was like the final moments in a movie.

The Spanish club, beaten finalists under Argentine Simeone in 2014, will play Manchester City or Real Madrid in the final after a 2-2 aggregate score sent them through on away goals.
"Over the 180 minutes we showed the work of three years," Simeone said.
"I hope that destiny will eventually help us in the final."
Trailing 1-0 from the first leg in Spain, Bayern levelled the tie through Xabi Alonso's deflected free-kick, before Atletico keeper Jan Oblak saved a Thomas Muller penalty,
Antoine Griezmann scored an equaliser on the break after-half-time - and although Robert Lewandowski's header set up a tense finish, Atletico held on, despite Fernando Torres missing a penalty.
Simeone, whose side beat holders Barcelona in the quarter-finals, was clearly emotional as he addressed the media after the game.
"It doesn't matter who we play in the final," he said. "I'm proud of what has happened to this club. We are beating the best teams in the world.
"It was a very good first half by Bayern, they're a great team. The missed penalty gave us life. The penalty miss by Torres hurt us - but in the end it was like a movie, thrilling, with five minutes extra time."
Torres, who rejoined his boyhood club Atletico after disappointing spells with Chelsea and AC Milan, said: "It was very intense. We are so proud of this team, it is fully deserved.
"We've beaten some of the best teams in Europe, now we're one step closer to the dream we all have. We have a chance to write the history that nobody at Atletico has.
"It doesn't matter who the opponent in the final is. We are ready to fight with everyone."
