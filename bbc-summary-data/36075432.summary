Port Vale captain Carl Dickinson says it is vital that they keep their squad together for next season.

Up-for-sale Vale, who still have an outside chance of reaching the League One play-offs, currently have only nine contracted players for next term.
Dickinson, one of those whose deals expire this summer, told BBC Radio Stoke that the players would be difficult to replace.
"We work hard for each other. Sometimes that's hard to find," said Dickinson.
"We have to keep this nucleus together. If something can get sorted, that would be brilliant.
"Everyone's fighting for their future," added former Stoke City defender Dickinson, who joined Vale from Watford in 2013, initially on a one-year deal, prior to signing a two-year contract the following summer.
"I don't want to be in limbo. It's horrible. I've got a wife and kids to think about."
Vale chairman Norman Smurthwaite has already warned that the club's budget may have to be cut by a further Â£800,000.
Playing as a wing-back in a new 3-5-2 formation at Gillingham on Saturday, Dickinson scored the second goal in Vale's 2-0 away win.
Coming after the 3-0 win which relegated neighbours Crewe, Vale are now back up to 11th, six points behind sixth-placed Gillingham.
And Dickinson believes those successive victories, which followed a damaging run of just one point in four matches, shows Vale are still firing on full cylinders.
"Everyone's fighting for it. I've heard it being said that we're already on our holidays, and that's rubbish," he said.
Top scorer AJ Leitch-Smith notched his 10th league goal of the season in Saturday's win at the Priestfield Stadium.
"It was a fantastic goal," added Dickinson. "It shows what he brings us. And his work-rate goes unsung too."
