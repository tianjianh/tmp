The 19-year-old made his first-team debut for Saints as a substitute in last October's 1-0 League Cup victory over Sunderland.
He also made three appearances for their Under-21 side in the EFL Trophy.
Olomola is the sixth summer signing by Yeovil boss Darren Way, who told the club website: "He is a strong footballer with very good pace."
