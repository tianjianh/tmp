A deal to sell one of Europe's biggest private stately homes to an investment company has fallen through.

The Grade I-listed Wentworth Woodhouse, near Rotherham, South Yorkshire, is larger than Buckingham Palace.
The 82-acre estate has been on sale since May with a price tag in excess of Â£8m. The deal had been due to be completed shortly, with terms agreed.
Estate Agents Savills confirmed the deal with Lake House Group, which is based in Hong Kong, was off.
A Savills spokesperson would not comment on a Times report stating subsidence caused by mining had been the reason behind the pull-out.
The Wentworth Woodhouse Preservation Trust (WWPT) said an estimated Â£42m is needed to spend on repairs to the home.
The Georgian mansion, which is open to the public for tours, has more than 300 rooms and a 185m (606ft) facade.
Julie Kenny, chair of the WWPT, said: "It did always strike me that they might drop out, so we have continued and will continue the battle to save this beautiful home.
"It needs a proper plan to repair it, renovate it and then open it to the public."
It was bought in 1999 by architect Clifford Newbold, who died in April. His family made the "reluctant decision" to sell the property after his death.
Restoration work was under way but it had been hampered by subsidence caused by mining, which was a key source of income to help with running costs for the house's former owners.
The history of Wentworth Woodhouse and the nearby village of Wentworth is linked with three aristocratic families, the Wentworths, Watsons and Fitzwilliams.
