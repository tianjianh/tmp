Burnley midfielder Steven Defour could be involved on Saturday after two months out with a hamstring injury.

Johann Berg Gudmunsson is back in training as he steps up his recovery from knee ligament damage but he is not ready to play.
Tottenham striker Vincent Janssen will be assessed after withdrawing from the Dutch squad with a chest infection.
Harry Kane and Danny Rose remain out, while Erik Lamela is out for the season after hip surgery.
Steve Bower: "Spurs have never had as many points at this stage of a Premier League season but they know they have to keep on winning.
"It was an important psychological step for them to get over the line last time out against Southampton without Harry Kane. Dele Alli, who has 11 goals in his last 12 league games, looks ready to assume more responsibility.
"A glance at Burnley's hugely impressive home record will remind Spurs of the task ahead at Turf Moor.
"Sean Dyche's team will be delighted to be back in Lancashire, having played their last four games on the road, and Tottenham are only too aware that they are a different proposition at home."

Burnley manager Sean Dyche: "It's been five of the last six away from home, which is a tough task for anyone, so we are certainly looking forward to getting back to the Turf.
"Now we are back at Turf Moor for five of our last nine - and although that doesn't guarantee anything, I think it's fair to say statistically it gives us more chance of getting more points on the board.
"Even if you look at Spurs, their away record is nowhere near their home record. It just goes to show that it's tough on the road in the Premier League."
Tottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino on Harry Kane's injury: "He will be fit before the end of the season and we believe he can be available in the near future.
"I cannot provide a time it will take for him to be available again, but I don't think it will be too long."
Nobody has gone to Burnley and rolled Sean Dyche's team over and I think they will pick up another point here as they keep edging towards Premier League safety.
