Take That joke tops poll of Christmas Cracker funnies

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Christmas cracker joke - an important feature of any festive get-together - but most of us reckon they're a bit outdated.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Cue a bunch of amateur comedians who've come up with their own offerings for 2014.
Around 2,000 people have voted for their top 10 from a list drawn up by judges for TV Channel Gold.
It features Luis Suarez, UKIP and The Great British Bake-off.
An Orange.
Bite-sized.
3. What do the royal family play at Christmas instead of musical chairs?
Game Of Thrones.
"Get out of my face."
He's got two parties to organise.
Santa gives you things you want.
Because he only comes if you sleep, not if Ukip.
They're always bowling snow-balls.
Because the Star is in the Yeast.
And my personal favourite that didn't make the top ten...
Twerky!
I'll get my coat.
