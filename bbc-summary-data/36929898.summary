[SN]TITLE[SN]
Reading 1-0 Preston North End

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Former Manchester United defender Jaap Stam celebrated his first competitive match in charge of Reading with a deserved victory over Preston.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Midfielder John Swift, signed from Chelsea in the summer, missed with an early chance but eventually marked his debut with a goal when he swept home Garath McCleary's corner.
Deniss Rakels headed wide and was also denied by Preston's Anders Lindegaard.
PNE midfielder Daniel Johnson had a shot saved after the break.
And North End, who changed formation at the restart, did contribute more to the match in the second 45 minutes.
But the Royals looked more dangerous throughout and ensured that Stam, who succeeded Brian McDermott as Reading manager in June, made a winning start to life in the Championship.
It could have been an even more comfortable afternoon for the majority of the 15,764 at the Madejski Stadium when PNE defender Paul Huntington almost sliced the ball into his own net midway through the second half.
North End did the double over the Royals last season but have not won on the opening day since 2008 and must wait at least another year to end that sequence.
Reading manager Jaap Stam: "We had a lot of possession in the first half and dominated the game totally. We created a couple of very good chances but did not finish it off. We should have scored a second goal.
"Some of our play was very good to watch. That's what we're aiming for. You can't do that against every team. But it's hard work and we're not there yet.
"We've only been working for six weeks and you can't achieve miracles in that time. But where the players are at the moment, we're very happy with that."
Preston manager Simon Grayson: "We were two yards off the pace in the first half. When we did press Reading, we didn't press quick enough to stop them from getting into a rhythm.
"We didn't do that as a team and so that was disappointing. And we never really looked a threat going forward, either.
"We're disappointed but it's a lesson to learn. We knew Reading were going to play high-risk football and if it comes off, it's all well and good. But when we did our job, we got into some good areas."
