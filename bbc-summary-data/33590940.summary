Drivers are facing 40 weeks of delays as work starts ahead of the building of a new Ikea store in Berkshire.

The Swedish furniture giant is spending £4m to improve junctions and access to a new outlet planned for Pincents Lane Retail Park in Reading.
The work includes widening Pincents Lane and replacing the existing roundabout on the A4 with a new traffic-light controlled junction.
The retailer is awaiting final agreement after plans were scaled down.
A £10m three-level store was approved in 2012 but the furniture company reduced its proposal to two storeys last year to reflect the "ever-changing retail environment".
There are not expected to be any issues over the approval of the new scheme, as a smaller store should mean fewer customers and cars travelling to the site.
Some residents and businesses had objected to the original plans because of traffic congestion fears.
