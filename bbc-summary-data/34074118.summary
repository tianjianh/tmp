The 26-year-old has been out since February following knee surgery after suffering medial ligament damage.
"It's only a matter of fitness now to get him back," said Hammers boss Slaven Bilic.
"If everything goes well he should participate in the game against Newcastle."
Carroll is starting his fourth season at Upton Park, including a loan spell preceding his Â£15m switch, and has made 46 Premier League starts in that time.
Meanwhile, striker Enner Valencia, 25, has apologised after being quoted as criticising the club's medical staff of refusing to keep him updated on the ankle injury he suffered in the 2-2 Europa League draw against Astra Giurgiu last month.
Bilic said: "Enner has apologised for his comments and he's back in a normal routine. The medical department is trying very hard to get him back."
