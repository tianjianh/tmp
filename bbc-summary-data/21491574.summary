Hollywood star Tom Cruise's visit to a Hertfordshire curry house has been turned into a film.

Last August, the Mission Impossible actor ordered lobster and chicken tikka masala when he and eight companions visited the Veer Dhara in St Albans.
A friend settled the bill after the restaurant told Cruise it did not accept American Express.
A video about his curry night has been entered into the inaugural St Albans Film Festival's short-film competition.
Festival director Leoni Kibbey said: "Everyone in the film is wearing a Tom Cruise mask. It's very funny."
Miss Kibbey said the festival - which runs from 8 March until 10 March - showcases the county's historic links with the film industry.
Director Stanley Kubrick lived in the St Albans area, film pioneer Arthur Melbourne-Cooper was born in St Albans and the Pinewood and Elstree studios are nearby.
Cruise was in Hertfordshire last August for the filming of All You Need Is Kill, which was shot at the county's Leavesden Studios.
