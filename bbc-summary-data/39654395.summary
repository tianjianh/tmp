Dog causes tailbacks on Scotland's busiest motorway

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Traffic was brought to a standstill on Scotland's busiest motorway after a dog was spotted running along the carriageway.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Police were called to the eastbound M8 at about 10:30 amid reports that a small brown dog was "running all over the Kingston Bridge" in Glasgow.
Motorists set up a rolling roadblock to help police catch the animal, which ran onto the M8 at Drumbreck.
The dog was eventually caught unhurt by officers shortly before 11:00.
Images from Traffic Scotland cameras showed officers from Police Scotland trying to coax the animal away from traffic.
It is not known how the animal came to be on the motorway, although its appearance caused significant tailbacks back to junction 22 Plantation.
