[SN]TITLE[SN]
Galashiels street knife attack man jailed

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An attacker who repeatedly stabbed his victim with two knives on a street in the Scottish Borders has been jailed for six-and-a-half years.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Robert Gregg, 39, assaulted Rory Morrison with the blades at Marmion Road, Galashiels, on 19 December 2015.
The High Court in Edinburgh heard how he knocked Mr Morrison to the ground before plunging the weapons into him.
Gregg, a prisoner of HMP Edinburgh, had previously admitted assault to severe injury and danger of life.
Sentence had been deferred for the court to obtain reports.
Defence solicitor advocate Jim Stephenson told judge Lady Scott that his client regretted attacking Mr Morrison.
Lady Scott said that the nature of the attack and the fact that Gregg had 24 previous convictions meant jail was the only sentence open to the court.
