Football League: Five things you may have missed

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Saturday saw the first promotion and relegations of the 2015-16 Football League season confirmed, but the drama was not merely restricted to a joyous Sixfields.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Here are five things you may have missed from Saturday's action...
At 35, one former Premier League star has been rolling back the years and showing he has most certainly still got it - and at a crucial time for his club.
Former England midfielder, and national team Player of the Year in 2011, Scott Parker helped Fulham beat Cardiff City with his first goal since 2014.
Parker's sweet left-footed strike, coupled with a dramatic, last-gasp goal for 20-year-old birthday-boy Emerson Hyndman, gave the west London club a vital third win in a row.
Fulham had won just three of their last 25 games before their recent revival, which has lifted them 10 points clear of the relegation zone.
That, together with wins for Bristol City and Rotherham, leaves the bottom three all at least nine points adrift of safety, with 23rd-placed Charlton - who lost to a 94th-minute goal at QPR, now looking doomed.
While Addicks fans will fear the worst, for some relegation is now already guaranteed.
For Bolton Wanderers and Crewe Alexandra fans, 9 April 2016 will not be a day they ever want to re-visit.
After a desperate season on and off the field, Wanderers' relegation to the third tier was assured as they lost 4-1 at Derby County.
"This has just confirmed the sort of season the club's had," Bolton Wanderers caretaker manager Jimmy Phillips said.
"The only positive thing we can say is that we still have a football club because, at one stage during the season, that was looking very doubtful."
For Crewe, a four-year stay in the third tier will end in May.
Since League One Swindon Town handed head coach Luke Williams a five-year deal on 9 March, it is fair to say it has been a month to forget for the club.
The Wiltshire outfit are yet to win in seven games since then - in stark contrast to their run of six wins from 10 while Williams was in interim charge.
After an "unacceptable" 6-0 loss to Scunthorpe, the club then had to deal with allegations that three players inhaled nitrous oxide on a live social media video.
Swindon suspended all three players - and despite apologies, the trio were not considered for selection for Saturday's 1-0 loss at Bradford City.
That defeat leaves the Robins six points above the relegation zone in 16th, with five matches remaining.
Wolves' 0-0 draw with Blackburn in the Championship was a third consecutive goalless match at Molineux - the first such barren run since 1899.
"That's frustrating. It's not what we want at home. We do want to create and we do want to go forward," Wolves boss Kenny Jackett said.

"For us that's six games unbeaten - that's an achievement and a good thing. But we do want more going forward.
"The fans want to see people going past opponents. They want to see one-on-one situations being exploited. Our biggest threat today was James Henry.
"We want to reward a very good, patient crowd with more going forward than we've served up."
You don't top any table in April by luck, and all three league leaders in the Football League showed just why they are where they are on Saturday, extending impressive unbeaten runs.
For Burnley, it is now 18 Championship games without a loss.
Northampton Town, who won promotion to League One with a 2-2 draw against Bristol Rovers, have not lost in 19 League Two matches.
And Wigan Athletic are now without defeat in 20 consecutive League One games.
Lastly, a little further down the English football pyramid, one club has endured such bad luck with injuries that it has officially run out of recognised goalkeepers.
National League North side Bradford Park Avenue had to call upon 30-year-old former Football League journeyman striker Liam Dickinson today, to start in nets, as they faced Boston United.
Seemingly, he didn't do too badly, either....
But eventually, Dickinson and co. succumbed to a 3-0 defeat.
The club explained that stoppers Jon Stewart (injured), Ryan Jones and Matty Wright were all unavailable - and an emergency loan was not possible.
