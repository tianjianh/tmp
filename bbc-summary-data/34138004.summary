Former £5m striker Lee Hughes has joined National League North club Worcester City, at the age of 39.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
His move to City, who play at Aggborough, home of Kidderminster Harriers, brings him back to the ground where his career began 20 years ago.
Smethwick-born Hughes began his career with the Harriers in 1995 before making his name at West Bromwich Albion.
It led to his biggest career move, when he joined Coventry for £5m in 2001, but he was only with City for a year.
He returned to The Hawthorns to help Albion win promotion to the Premier League in 2002, but was then sent to prison in August 2004 for causing death by dangerous driving.
After three years out of action, he returned to play in the lower reaches of the Football League, still proving a prolific scorer with Oldham, Notts County and Port Vale before dropping down to the Conference with Forest Green in January 2014.
Hughes then returned to Kidderminster in February, more than 17 years after he left the club, but managed just three goals in 13 games.
He began this season with Northern Premier League side Ilkeston Town, but has now answered the call from a struggling Worcster side who are second bottom of National League North, having picked up just four points from their first seven games.
