Angol, 22, has scored 28 goals in 44 career league starts, scoring five goals in 11 games during a loan spell with National League champions Lincoln City at the end of the season.
Right-back White, also 22, was on loan with the Stags from January.
The double signing means Mansfield have brought in five players in two days.
Striker Jimmy Anderson, midfielder Paul Digby and winger Paul Anderson all joined on Wednesday, with defender Zander Diamond and goalkeeper Conrad Logan signing last week.
Tottenham academy graduate Angol has also played for Wycombe Wanderers, Luton Town as well as a loan spell with Boreham Wood.
"We have signed another talented young player," said manager Steve Evans. "I will not speak about what he will do as his abilities will shine through.
"Signing Hayden White on a permanent deal was something which was at the forefront of my mind."
