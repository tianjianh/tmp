Lewis Hine posted the video to mark his 16th birthday and it has been viewed more than 20 million times on Facebook.
It prompted Sir Elton John to phone him to say it had moved him to tears.
Lewis, from Portsmouth, wanted to raise Â£15,000 for teenagers who had missed their school proms through illness or disability to have their own party.
The teenager has undergone brain surgery more than a dozen times since he was diagnosed with the tumour aged 17 months. He still encounters daily seizures as a result.
He set up a project called Friend Finder, to help other youngsters who had spent a lot of time away from school and found it hard to make friends.
The online appeal was set up to help fund a prom event for young people aged 15-19 planned for Portsmouth Guildhall in June.
Earlier this week, Lewis said: "The kindness and support from around the world has been unbelievable."
He added that after the prom is funded all extra money raised will go towards making the project accessible all over the world "to make sure everyone has a friend".
