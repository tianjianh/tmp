The 22-storey, 78m-high (256ft), Beckley Point building in Plymouth, is due to be occupied by university students from September.
It is unclear whether the group was "rooftopping" - climbing to the top of structures to take photographs.
Devon and Cornwall Police said it was aware of the incident.

A planning application for a high-rise student building on the site was first sought back in 2003. The current building will have 500 flats.
A Kier construction firm spokesperson said: "As our site at Beckley Point is closed today, our security team was patrolling with CCTV and immediately sent a team to site when they became aware of intruders.
"The site was found to be clear and secure and we are continuing to investigate."
