Carl Hogg: Worcester Warriors must 'get up to speed' on new 4G pitch

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Worcester Warriors head coach Carl Hogg has admitted it is "essential" they become a force on their new artificial pitch next season.

The Premiership club are laying a new organic surface at Sixways, joining Saracens and Newcastle in playing their home games on an all-weather pitch.
"It does change the dynamics of the game slightly," Hogg, 47, told BBC Hereford and Worcester.
"It's part and parcel of the game now - we need to get up to speed with it."
Warriors' three pre-season matches are all away - against French side Clermont Auvergne, Jersey and Munster - while their new home is being prepared.
They start the 2016-17 season against European and Premiership champions Sarries at Twickenham before local rivals Gloucester come to Sixways on 9 September.
And with five of their seven wins last term coming at home, Hogg knows this campaign on their own patch will be even more important.
"It's essential that we find our feet," Hogg said.
"Our new surface should give us an added advantage playing on it every other week.
"You can lock-out the scrums because your feet get more purchase and the mauls and other contact areas tend to be much more cleaner and sharper on a 4G surface and that's something you have to build your decision making around."
Warriors will renew their rivalry with newly-promoted Bristol after Andy Robinson's side finally got out of the second tier last season after four previous play-off failures.
Bristol did the double over Warriors in the Championship two seasons ago but Worcester got revenge winning a pulsating play-off final in May 2015 by a single point on aggregate.
And Hogg is expecting Robinson's side to be a threat.
"Andy's done a fantastic job down there - it's been two or three years in the making," Hogg said.
"They've got some real consistency and they'll be a challenge in the Premiership, especially at Ashton Gate."
