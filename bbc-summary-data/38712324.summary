Scottish Cup fifth-round draw: Holders Hibs could face Hearts in cup

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Holders Hibernian could face a trip across Edinburgh in the fifth round of the Scottish Cup after being drawn against Hearts or Raith Rovers.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Hearts host the Kirkcaldy side in their replay on Wednesday after a 1-1 draw.
Scottish champions Celtic host Inverness Caledonian Thistle in one of three all-Premiership ties.
Ross County entertain Aberdeen, while Partick Thistle travel to face St Johnstone, with Rangers hosting Championship side Greenock Morton.
Top-flight Hamilton Academical also face second-tier opposition and are away to Dunfermline Athletic.
Championship strugglers St Mirren's reward for their surprise win away to top-flight Dundee is a trip to Methil to face in-form League One side East Fife.
Two replays will decide who plays in the final tie.
The winner of the game at Hampden between League One side Queen's Park and Championship visitors Ayr United will host a team from League Two, with Clyde entertaining Stirling Albion.
On the way to beating Rangers in last season's final, Hibs defeated Hearts 1-0 in a replay after a 2-2 draw at the same fifth-round stage.
Caley Thistle are the only Premiership side to have taken a point from Celtic, who beat Albion Rovers 3-0 on Sunday, this season.
Celtic manager Brendan Rodgers though insists the game is not about revenge.
"The only reason to win is to get into the next round," Rodgers told BBC Scotland. "We deserved to win the away game earlier in the season (the 2-2 draw with Inverness), their goalkeeper had an outstanding game.
"You're always happy to get a home draw and we'll look forward to that when the time comes.
"I'm not thinking about (the treble), my thinking is each game. We're in every competition to win it. We've had a good win, now we move on to Wednesday night (at home to St Johnstone), which will be a tough game for us, and try to maintain the momentum."
