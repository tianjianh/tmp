A zoo where a keeper was mauled to death by a tiger has been charged with health and safety breaches.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Sarah McClay died at South Lakes Wild Animal Park (now known as South Lakes Safari Zoo) in Dalton-in-Furness, south Cumbria, in May 2013.
It also faces charges after a keeper fell off a ladder while feeding big cats in 2014, and over failure to comply with two improvement notices.
A hearing will be held before magistrates in Barrow on 27 August.
An inquest into the death of Miss McClay recorded a narrative verdict.
She suffered deep puncture wounds to her neck and body when a Sumatran tiger pounced on her.
Barrow Council is prosecuting the zoo and its director, David Gill, over the alleged offences.
