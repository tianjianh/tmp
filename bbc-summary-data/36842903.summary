The boy, said to be Jack Pullen, was pulled from the River Etherow, in Broadbottom, near Hyde, at 17:45 BST on Tuesday.
Police believe he had been playing with friends in the river before the "tragic accident".
Tuesday was the hottest day of 2016 so far, according to the Met Office, with temperatures reaching 31C (87.8F).
Flowers were left at the riverside as Jack's father, Gary Pullen, from nearby Hattersley, spoke with reporters.
Overcome with emotion and accompanied by a woman, he said: "He just wanted to be a teenager and be out with his mates."
Jack had recently left Longendale High School in Hollingsworth, near Glossop.
A card at the scene read: "To Jack always in our hearts and thoughts, lots of love Family xxx"
Another read: "Jack, Heaven has gained a beautiful angel and we're all left wondering why. Such a beautiful kid. Jack we are all gonna miss you so much. Love you always XXX."
Det Insp Andy Sandiford said: "We have launched an investigation into this tragic incident which appears to have begun with a group of friends playing in the river on a hot summer's day.
"We understand the water appeared calm and shallow but there may have been strong undercurrents and hidden hazards beneath the surface.
"A team of detectives are investigating the incident and have concluded that there are no suspicious circumstances surrounding the boy's death."
He said the boy's family is being supported by specially trained officers.
A man who lives nearby, who declined to be identified, said: "One of my neighbours was first on the scene.
"They found a distraught 16-year-old wondering where his mate had gone.
"Everybody on the road is upset because we've seen them doing it. It's like a sign of summer seeing kids jump in and having a laugh."
He said he believed the boy had jumped from a rocky area approximately 2ft high.
Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue Service has issued water safety advice on its website, which includes warnings about the depth of water and hidden dangers such as submerged shopping trolleys, opened tin cans or broken bottles and hidden currents.
