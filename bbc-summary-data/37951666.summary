"Once they're done I'm going to say, 'Okay, that's goodbye to all that,'" he said in an interview with his grandson.
"At this point in my life, age 80, it'd give me more satisfaction."
The actor and director, known for such films as Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, was recently seen in a remake of Disney film Pete's Dragon.
The Oscar-winning star of The Sting and Out of Africa is also known for founding the Sundance Film Festival in Utah.
Speaking to his grandson Dylan, Redford said he was "an impatient person" who found it hard "to sit around and do take after take after take".
The actor, who once studied as an artist in Paris, also revealed he was considering "going back to sketching" as he entered his ninth decade.
Redford said he had a pair of acting projects in the pipeline - "a love story for older people" and "a lighter piece".
The two films - Our Souls at Night co-starring Jane Fonda and The Old Man and the Gun co-starring Casey Affleck - will be released in 2017.
Redford's last directorial feature was The Company You Keep, a 2012 thriller in which he also appeared.
