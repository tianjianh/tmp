[SN]TITLE[SN]
Hartlepool United 1-1 Luton Town

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Alan Sheehan's sublime free-kick earned Luton a draw at 10-man Hartlepool and moved the Hatters up to second in League Two.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The veteran defender curled home against Hartlepool, who saw Nicky Featherstone given a 55th-minute red card, to cancel out birthday boy Nathan Thomas' first-half opener for the hosts.
Luton enjoyed a bright start as Pelly Ruddock Mpanzu twice went close to opening the scoring.
But Pools grew into the contest and netted on the stroke of half-time when Thomas tapped into an empty net after Christian Walton parried Lewis Hawkins' effort into his path.
Craig Hignett's men almost doubled their advantage as Padraig Amond rattled the woodwork, and their frustration was only compounded by Featherstone being shown a straight red card for a lunge on Olly Lee.
The buoyed Hatters pressed forward, with Jack Marriott volleying over from close range before Toto Nsiala brilliantly deflected Mpanzu's effort onto the woodwork.
A leveller came when Sheehan expertly found the top corner from 20 yards, with Luton frustrated not to take all three points as Jack Marriott blazed a glorious chance over in stoppage time.
