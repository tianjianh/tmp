Juventus win fifth straight Serie A title as Napoli lose to Roma

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Juventus have been crowned Serie A champions for a fifth season in a row after Napoli's 1-0 defeat at Roma.

Sunday's 2-1 win at Fiorentina put them on the brink of glory, and Napoli's failure to win on Monday meant Juve can no longer be caught.
It completes a stunning rise for the Turin side, who were in 12th place and 11 points off the top on 28 October.
However, they have won 24 of their 25 league games since then, drawing the other, to take them clear.
Napoli's defeat actually denies Juventus the chance to win the title at their own ground. They host Carpi on Sunday at 11:30 BST.
