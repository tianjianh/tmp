The walk-in centre and GP surgery in Guildhall Walk could be relocated to St Mary's Treatment Centre and a new city location respectively.
Lalys Pharmacy, which organised the petition, said that would add pressure to A&E at Queen Alexandra Hospital.
Portsmouth Clinical Commissioning Group said it would be simpler for patients.
Its said its preferred option was to create a single, enhanced walk-in service at St Mary's including GPs and nurses.
It would treat minor injuries and minor illnesses and be "backed up by modern facilities and diagnostic equipment" with "well-established links" to specialist hospital teams and ambulance crews.
But Portsmouth City Council has also asked the group not to close the premises.
Deputy leader Luke Stubbs said: "The centre is a valuable resource for the city, providing appointment-free access to medical services and hosting a substantial GP practice.
"Being situated in a visible location in the city centre the doctors' practice is the preferred option for many residents and students."
Dr Raj Laly, director of the pharmacy, said there was "so much wrong" with the plan, including choice of location and lack of parking or public transport links.
He added: "At a time when the UK's most critical healthcare priority is to provide alternatives to hospital A&E, how can the only out-of-hours GP surgery in Portsmouth's city centre be closed?"
Pharmacy staff handed the petition over to officials at the group's offices.
People who want to give their views on the proposals can comment on the CCG's website.
