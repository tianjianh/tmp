Georgia's 18-year-old scrum-half Vasil Lobzhanidze will become the youngest player in Rugby World Cup history after being selected to play Tonga.

Lobzhanidze, who will not turn 19 until mid-October, is set to beat the record currently held by Thretton Palamo.
The American was 19 years old and eight days when he played against South Africa in 2007.
Georgia and Tonga, who are in Pool C along with New Zealand, play each in Gloucester on Saturday (12:00 BST).
Georgia coach Milton Haig described the opening game as "critical" to his team's hopes of finishing third in the group, which would secure automatic qualification for the 2019 Rugby World Cup in Japan.
"You don't have to be a rocket scientist to see that Tonga are in the same position as we are so it's going to be a critical game," he said.
Tonga have made six changes to the team which started against Romania in their last World Cup warm-up match.
Telusa Veainu starts on the wing rather than full-back, with Vunga Lilo wearting the number 15 jersey.
Viliami Ma'afu starts at number eight, while Sione Kalamafoni moves to blindside flanker and Steve Mafi switches to the second-row. Tevita Mailiau starts at loose-head, replacing Soane Tonga'uiha.
Winger Fetu'u Vainikolo will become Tonga's outright leading try scorer should he score on Saturday.
