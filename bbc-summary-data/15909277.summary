Speed had appeared on BBC1's Football Focus show on Saturday afternoon, just hours before his death.
Footballers, celebrities and politicians began issuing tributes within minutes of the news.
Former Wales team mate, Robbie Savage, Tweeted: "The world has lost a great man in Gary speed I'm devastated spoke to him yesterday morning why ! Why. Why !! I'll miss him so much x
"He come to watch strictly 3/4 weeks ago I high fived him in the front row he loved the show ,he loved life he loved his family ! Devastated".

"Gary Speed served club and country as a player and manager with great distinction."
Andrew RT Davies, Welsh Conservatives leader, said: "Gary Speed was tremendously gifted and I - along with millions of others - will always remember him as a legend in the game of football."
'Never be forgotten'
Welsh Liberal Democrats leader, Kirsty Williams, said: "It is a terrible, terrible shock. A tragedy for the Speed family and a tragedy for Welsh football."
Plaid Cymru leader Ieuan Wyn Jones said the "whole nation is in shock", adding: "He will never be forgotten."
At the Liberty Stadium in Swansea - where the home side were playing Aston Villa a minute's silence followed by a minute's applause was held.
Speed, born in Mancot, Flintshire, took over the Wales job in December 2010, and earlier this month, said the side's rapid improvement had exceeded all expectations.
A 4-1 friendly win over Norway represented a third successive win for Wales, and Speed's fifth in 10 games as manager.
At the time, he said: "We've progressed further than I'd have thought in this space of time but we've still got a lot of work to do."
'Stunned and saddened'
Speed won 85 caps for his country during a 14-year international career.
He was given the top job in Welsh football despite only having four months managerial experience.
Speed began his playing career at Leeds United after coming through the trainee ranks, and was part of the side that won the last Football League title in 1992, before the introduction of the Premier League.
A Leeds spokesman said the club was "stunned and saddened" by the news.
He was handed his Wales debut as a 20-year-old in the 1-0 friendly win over Costa Rica in May 1990.
He left Leeds in 1996 after 312 appearances to join Everton - who he went on to captain - in a £3.5m move.
Seven goals
Newcastle followed, in a £5.5m switch in 1998. During his six years with the Magpies, he suffered two FA Cup final defeats, but enjoyed a taste of Champions League football.
He then spent four years with Bolton Wanderers after agreeing a £750,000 move.
Speed became the first player to reach 500 Premier League appearances.
He retired from international duty in 2004, having scored seven goals and captaining his country 44 times.
Speed's final appearance came in 3-2 World Cup qualifying defeat by Poland in October 2004.
His tally of 85 caps is a record for an outfield player.
