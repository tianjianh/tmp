[SN]TITLE[SN]
Aberdeen 'legal high' shop Harminasion is closed down

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An Aberdeen shop which sells "legal high" drugs has been closed in what is believed to be a Scottish first.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Police Scotland, assisted by Aberdeen City Council, secured a closure order for Harminasion in George Street.
It was due to what the force described as persistent complaints and concerns about "anti-social behaviour arising from the sale of legal highs on the premises".
Legal highs are officially called new psychoactive substances (NPS).
Harminasion will be closed under the Antisocial Behaviour etc (Scotland) Act 2004 for an initial three months.
Ch Supt Adrian Watson said: "We have had a significant number of complaints raised by the public and businesses in the area and despite trying to work this through with the shop concerned, we, as a partnership, have taken this action in bringing the closure order to give the community some well-deserved respite and to keep people safe."
