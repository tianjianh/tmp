Average speed cameras to aid A90 road workers

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Average speed cameras are to be installed on a stretch of roadworks for the Aberdeen bypass.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
It follows complaints from construction workers on the Blackdog to Balmedie stretch of the A90 that they are being endangered by vehicles speeding.
A 50mph limit was introduced earlier this year as work on the Balmedie to Tipperty dual carriageway progressed.
Transport Scotland said the cameras would also improve traffic flow and cut delays.
The installation will begin on Friday and, once installed, the cameras will display test signs which will be removed when the system becomes operational.
Police Scotland said officers would continue to carry out high-visibility patrols on the road.
