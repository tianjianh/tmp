Parents want more voice in school policy

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Parents' views are not considered enough over their children's education, according to a survey of parents.

More than eight out of 10 parents want to be consulted more, according to an annual survey from PTA UK, representing parents groups in England, Wales and Northern Ireland.
The biggest concern for parents was about bullying in school.
PTA UK head Emma Williams said: "Parents want to have a say in education."
"Many of the decisions made by government and schools affect parents one way or another, so it's only right that they should be able to contribute their views," said Ms Williams.
She said without proper engagement, parents would remain an "untapped resource" for schools.
According to the survey, almost half of parents did not expect the government to listen to them on school policy.
Bullying and cyber-bullying were the top issues where parents wanted schools to take action.
There were also concerns about the costs associated with school - with almost three-quarters saying parental payments were increasing for costs such as school trips and uniforms.
More than a third had been asked to make donations to school funds.
The parent-teacher organisations said the education system needed to pay closer attention to the views of parents on such issues of costs and funding.
"PTA UK calls on the government, education authorities and schools to redouble their efforts to involve and engage all parents," said Ms Williams.
