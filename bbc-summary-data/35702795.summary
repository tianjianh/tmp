The 24-year-old, who returned to the England training squad on Tuesday after 15 months out because of injury, could play against Exeter on Sunday.
Tuilagi could then make his international return in the Six Nations match against Wales on 12 March.
England have retained 22 players, with Alex Goode, Courtney Lawes and Jamie George among the others released.
"This is an opportunity for them to get back to their clubs, to play well, to get some more game time under their belts, and rejoin us ready for the next match," said England forwards coach Steve Borthwick.
Tuilagi has scored 11 tries in 25 England appearances, but has not featured for his country since June 2014 as his career has been disrupted by injury and off-field disciplinary problems.
He returned to action for Leicester in January but injured a hamstring in his third game back, further delaying his Test comeback.
Tuilagi feared during the past year his rugby career might be over - and said his focus is now on staying fit.
"When you're out for a long time, it can get quite hard mentally," he said. "I just kept thinking about when I was going to get back playing again. I kept thinking that there's going to be light at the tunnel and it did come in the end - thank God."
Borthwick, a former England captain, says Tuilagi has looked in "good shape".
"It's great to have him here. He's done well in the short time he's been back with us, and he's certainly a player that will hopefully have an impact for this team," Borthwick added.
"Hopefully he'll have another good game for his club side this weekend."
