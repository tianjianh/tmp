Bristol Airport has rejected calls to boost tourism by including the city of Bath in its name.

Some tourism experts in the West have said the area would benefit more from the American market if the airport included Bath in its title.
They claim it would attract US visitors who are "more familiar" with Bath as a destination.
Airport bosses said Bath was a "key part" of its marketing efforts but "there are no plans" for a name change.
Gwyneth Lloyd, who is originally from Boston and runs a tourism company in Bristol, said Bath was more of a pull for tourists.
"I wasn't really aware of Bristol as a mid-sized city and I'd lived in England before," she added.
Ms Lloyd, who has lived in Bedminster for two-years, said: "I didn't become aware of it until a friend of mine drove all around and came back and said 'oh my goodness, Bristol's amazing'."
Martin Poole, from Bristol and Bath Cultural Destinations Partnership Project, said: "I think it's an example, a symbol really, of how the two cities can work together to attract more visitors and tourists to the region."
Mr Poole said the two cities attracted more than 20 million visitors and tourists every year, contributing Â£1.5bn to the economy.
In a statement, Bristol Airport said Bath's "strong international profile" was "incredibly important" in attracting visitors to the West of England.
It has been promoting both cities and has seen an increase in passengers.
"There are no plans to change the name of the airport now or in the foreseeable future," the statement said.
