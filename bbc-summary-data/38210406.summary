Leven rolling pin murder trial begins

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The trial of a woman accused of murdering an 82-year-old grandmother with a rolling pin in Fife has begun.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Sandra Weir denies murdering Mary Logie at her Leven home on 5 January 2016.
Ms Weir has lodged a special defence of alibi claiming that around the time of the murder she was elsewhere in Leven.
Ms Weir, 41, denies stealing money and jewellery from Mrs Logie, fraudulently using her bank card and attempting to defeat the ends of justice by cleaning up blood and disposing of clothing.
The trial is expected to last about two weeks at the High Court in Edinburgh.
