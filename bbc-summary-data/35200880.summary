Dr Rosie Plummer said after running the garden in Llanarthney, Carmarthenshire, "on a shoestring", it was time for someone else to take over.
She said funding cuts from the Welsh government and Carmarthenshire council threatened the garden's future.
Councillor David Jenkins said the contribution will be considered "as part of our budget review" to be looked at in the new year.
The council previously said funding would reduce from £70,000 this year to £50,000 next year and £30,000 in 2017-18 and would depend on the garden improving its use of the Welsh language and becoming more sustainable.
Dr Plummer, who has been at the helm for six years, said: "Commercialisation? Yes, but not to the detriment of the core mission purpose... Tourism? Yes, but not to the detriment of conservation, education and inspiration."
She acknowledged the gardens have to be more commercial, but said it earns more towards its keep than any other National Botanic Garden in the UK.
Mr Jenkins, the council's executive member for resources, added: "The botanic garden is an important attraction for Carmarthenshire, however, it needs to be sustainable."
