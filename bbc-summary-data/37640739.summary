[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Five-time world champion Ronnie O'Sullivan says snooker tournaments have become so regular they are 'like buses'.

O'Sullivan won a last-frame decider against China's Zhao Xintong to reach the third round of the English Open, but was not worried about losing.
"You've got so many tournaments, it's not really a bad thing if you lose," O'Sullivan told BBC Radio 5 live.
"It's like a bus, you know there's going to be one quickly coming along."
Earlier this year, 40-year-old O'Sullivan refused to an attempt a maximum 147 break at the Welsh Open because the Â£10,000 prize money on offer was "too cheap".
The 2016 Welsh Open champion continued: "You just think well, that's a few days off and then you've got one the next week."
"So it was a win-win situation for me, I didn't really care if I won or lost.
"I know it might sound quite strange, but that's just how it feels."
A break of 62 earned O'Sullivan a 4-3 win and set up a third-round tie against Chris Wakelin in Manchester.
Judd Trump also won in the final frame, beating Jamie Bodle, but top seed Mark Selby lost 4-3 to Liam Highfield.
Neil Robertson enjoyed a 4-1 win over Duane Jones, while Stuart Bingham and John Higgins also progressed.
