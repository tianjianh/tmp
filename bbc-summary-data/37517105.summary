[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A restaurant is advertising for a "gin butler" whose main attribute must be three years' experience of drinking the spirit.

Andrew Kettlewell, who owns Redherring in Lowestoft, Suffolk, said he wanted to find a "different calibre" of staff.
Mr Kettlewell is looking for a "culturally-refined individual" who "feels the love" for the spirit.
He admitted he made up the "gin butler" name but said the quirky advert had attracted 35 applicants.
More than 900 people have also viewed the advert online, which calls for a "natural entertainer who loves gin".
Mr Kettlewell said:  "We require three years or more experience as new age drinkers only see the gin boom as the norm, whereas experienced 'gin swillers' will understand that only a few years ago, everyone just associated Gordon's as pretty much the sole gin company and have seen it develop."
If gin is not your tipple of choice, that does not rule you out of the Â£22,000 a year job.
"Say, for example, a 'rum butler' applies, that's not a problem at all and they could probably teach us something too," the owner said.
The restaurant bar has about 50 artisan gins and runs a "gin club" twice a month.
The job title was designed to attract a "quirky person to fit in with our quirky team", Mr Kettlewell said.
