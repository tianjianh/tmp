Souleymane Coulibaly: Kilmarnock turn down £500,000 bid for striker

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Kilmarnock have rejected a £500,000 bid for striker Souleymane Coulibaly from Egyptian club Zamalek.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The offer falls short of the Rugby Park club's valuation of the 22-year-old Ivorian, who is Killie's top scorer with 11 goals this season.
Zamalek's rivals Al Ahly are also interested in the player but have yet to make a bid.
Former Tottenham youth player Coulibaly signed a three-year contract when he joined Kilmarnock in June.
He has also played for Grosseto, Bari and Pistoiese in Italy as well as Peterborough and Newport County, making 100 club appearances in total.
Capped at Under-20 level, the forward is yet to play for Ivory Coast's senior team.
Lee Clark's Kilmarnock, who recruited defender Karleigh Osborne on Monday, host Hamilton Academical in the Scottish Cup on Saturday then take on visitors Ross County in the Premiership on 28 January.
