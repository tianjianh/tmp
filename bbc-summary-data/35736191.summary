[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
South Wales Police have been given more time to question a 66-year-old man arrested on suspicion of her murder after a court hearing on Saturday.
Officers were alerted when relatives became concerned about the whereabouts of Ms James.
She lived alone in her fourth-floor flat in Century Wharf after moving from Cowbridge in November 2015.
Det Chief Insp Ceri Hughes said: "Mrs James' family are being supported by a family liaison officer at this extremely distressing time and a murder inquiry is under way to establish the circumstances leading to her death.
"Although one man has been arrested and remains in custody, we are still very much appealing for information and for witnesses to come forward."
Ms James was last seen returning to her housing complex at about 12:30 GMT on Friday, February 26 and friends spoke to her on the telephone at about 14:00 that day.
On the Saturday she was due to travel to Gatwick Airport to catch a flight to Florida.
Following concerns by relatives that she never arrived in London, officers conducted a welfare visit to her flat on Wednesday where her body was discovered at about 14:15.
South Wales Police has referred the matter voluntarily to the Independent Police Complaints Commission.
On Saturday, detectives were granted a further 36 hours to question a man at Cardiff Bay police station, following his arrest on Wednesday.
They appealed for anyone with information to contact them.
