Lisa Robertson (2), Abi Harrison, Chelsea Cornet, and Rachel McLaughlin added to a Natalie Conner own goal.
Edinburgh rivals Hearts beat Hamilton Accies 3-0, while Celtic edged past Forfar Farmington 1-0 and Glasgow City won 8-0 against Jeanfield Swifts.
Stirling University beat Buchan 7-1, Rangers were 8-3 winners over EUHV and Spartans defeated Motherwell 4-3.
Last season's double cup winners Hibs were expected to brush East Fife aside at King George V Park, but despite one-way traffic and a host of chances in the first half, they only had a two-goal lead to show for it at the break.
Harrison headed in Cornet's corner in 15 minutes and the latter found the net herself shortly before half-time when she got on to Joelle Murray's through-ball and slotted into the bottom corner.
The Fifers had defended stoutly but Robertson scored twice in the opening five minutes of the second half to put the game beyond the hosts.
First, she chipped goalkeeper Charlene Lessells before a left-foot volley made it 4-0.
Substitute Amy Gallagher's ball across goal was turned in by the unfortunate Conner just after the hour mark and McLaughlin tapped in a sixth in the final minutes.
Hibs head coach Chris Roberts admitted his side were rusty after three months without a competitive game but feels that last year's league runners-up are in good shape ahead of the Premier League curtain-raiser against Rangers on 12 March.
Glasgow City won the league by eight points last season, but a three-way fight is expected this time with Celtic also noticeably improving their squad.
"Our pre-season has been good," Roberts told BBC Scotland. "I would have liked for us to be more clinical in the final third today because we did create a lot of chances, but ultimately we're happy with the clean sheet, happy with the six goals and looking forward to seeing the draw for the next round.
"Huge respect to East Fife. I was impressed with how quickly they got back into position, they organised well and they really pressed and defended as a team in their own half, which made it difficult for us."
Savannah Jordan marked her Glasgow City debut with a hat-trick in the win over Swifts. Abbi Grant grabbed a double, with Savannah McCarthy, Nicola Docherty and Sam Kerr also on target for the Scottish champions.
Hearts' Ashley Carse netted a quickfire double and Jennifer Dodds scored late on in the 3-0 win over Accies, while Jordan McLintock and Chantelle Brown hit doubles as Rangers put eight past Edinburgh University Hutchison Vale.
In a seven-goal thriller at Ravenscraig, Simone McMahon and Laura Gavin gave Spartans what looked a comfortable 2-0 lead against Motherwell. They were, however, pegged back to 2-2 before Alana Marshall and Bobbie Beveridge restored the two-goal cushion and a late free-kick made it 4-3.
Natalie Rose was on target in Celtic's win over Forfar Farmington, who finished the game with 10 players following Gemma Collier's second yellow card.
