Up to 60 bands in colourful costumes took part in the Grand Finale street parade. There were also 38 sound systems to entertain crowds.
More than a million people are believed to have attended the event across its two days.
Earlier, three men were arrested after a man suffered stab wounds.
A man in his 20s was taken to hospital with life-threatening injuries at about 13:00 BST.
Police made more than 300 arrests for a range of offences during the festival, including assault, criminal damage, public order offences and theft.
More than 3,500 canisters containing nitrous oxide, also known as laughing gas, were seized over the weekend, police said.
One officer suffered a dislocated nose when he was punched in the face while confiscating 400 canisters in Lonsdale Road.
A person was arrested on suspicion of assault occasioning actual bodily harm.
BBC London 94.9 broadcast live from the carnival with Eddie Nestor from 17:00 BST.
Road and Tube closures were in place for the duration of the two-day event.
Carnival-goer Rebecca Perkins said: "There's something about moving your body to the rhythm of the beat and being surrounded by others doing the same and laughing and smiling and speaking with complete strangers. I love it."

The event this year came in for criticism after organisers demanded journalists and photographers pay Â£100 for accreditation and share their work on the festival's website.
But organisers said it was necessary to meet the requirements of a modern sustainable carnival.
There was also some discrepancy over the year the carnival officially started.
The Notting Hill Carnival Enterprises Trust said some people thought the first carnival dated back to 1964 while others argue it started two years later in 1966.
