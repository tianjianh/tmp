The men, aged 25, and 35, were arrested earlier on Tuesday on suspicion of financing terrorism, police said.
They were arrested at two separate addresses where officers are continuing to carry out inquiries.
"The arrests were part of a continuing investigation and were intelligence led. There was no immediate threat to public safety," a force spokesman said.
The 25-year-old was released on bail pending further inquiries, West Midlands Police said.
