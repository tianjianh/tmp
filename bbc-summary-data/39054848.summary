Sarah Lowndes, 40, from Derby, was told she had breast cancer several years ago and the cancer has since spread.
She and fiancÃ© David, whom she met when driving buses, have received many offers including catering, flowers, food and a wedding dress.
"I'm so grateful that so many strangers are willing to help," she said.

She and her partner David Moore told the Derby Telegraph they had been unable to fund their wedding due to her illness.
Ms Lowndes, who has two children, was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2010, before meeting Mr Moore two years later.
However, in 2013, she was told the cancer had returned and it had spread to her bones and liver.
She had to give up her job as a bus driver to undergo chemotherapy to keep the cancer stable.
She said despite everything, the pair were desperate to get married.
"Trying to save has been difficult because I've been bad and [David has] had to have time off work," she said.
A charity called Wish for a Wedding stepped in to help. It was started by Rachael Kirkwood to help provide weddings for couples dealing with terminal illness.
She said: "It's overwhelming the amount of support we get from the public on each wedding.
"There are so many kind and generous people out there in our local communities, willing to offer their service for free."
Ms Lowndes and Mr Moore are hoping to hold their wedding at the end of April or early May.
