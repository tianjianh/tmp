Julia Chikosi was seen by her mother at her home in the city's Mount Vernon area on Sunday 8 May.
She was last seen when she attended an appointment in the Bridgeton area on Wednesday 11 May.
Police said that Julia has not made contact with any friends or family since then and had not been sighted.
She is described as black, about 5ft 4in tall, with brown eyes and black collar-length hair.
She also has a tribal tattoo on her left ankle and another on her left thigh.
Insp Alan McDaid said: "Julia has now not been in touch with her family or friends for over six months, which is highly unusual. She's also missed some family events, which is out of character.
"Her family and friends are very concerned about her and want to know that she is safe and well.
"I would appeal directly to Julia to get in touch with a friend, family member or Police Scotland, so that we can establish that she is safe and well.
The detective said that Ms Chikosi enjoyed "travel and art, and regularly travels throughout the UK and Ireland attending various art and craft events and religious retreats".
Insp McDaid added: "Anyone with information regarding Julia's whereabouts should contact officers."
