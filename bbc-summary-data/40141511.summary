World Cup 2018: Boyce and Magennis set for NI starts in vital Azerbaijan game

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Northern Ireland boss Michael O'Neill looks set to retain Liam Boyce and Josh Magennis as his strikers in Saturday's World Cup qualifier in Azerbaijan.

The duo impressed against New Zealand last weekend as Boyce scored his first international goal and O'Neill has hinted that they will start again.
"When we've asked Josh to come and play through the middle he's never let us down," said O'Neill.
"Liam has had a great season. He's looking very, very sharp in training."

In contrast, Kyle Lafferty's limited outings at club level this season leave him "not in the best condition we'd like him to be", O'Neill admitted on Thursday.
"But for whatever part of the game he (Lafferty) plays, I'm sure he'll make sure he does a good job for us."
The Northern Irish are without Conor Washington, who is getting married this weekend, while Jamie Ward, who also scored in the qualifier win over Norway in March, is ruled out by injury.
Centre-back Gareth McAuley, 37, looks set to play after missing the New Zealand game because of a thigh injury but Watford defender Craig Cathcart will be missing because of a knee problem.
Veteran Aaron Hughes could replace Cathcart if O'Neill's selects a back three but the manager could instead opt to switch to a back four.
Northern Ireland hammered Azerbaijan 4-0 in Belfast seven months ago when the home side's set-piece prowess caused the lightweight opposition countless problems.
O'Neill's squad have doubtless been practising their free-kicks and corner-kicks at length this week, which included five days in southern Turkey to acclimatise for the expected high temperatures in Baku.

Northern Ireland lost 2-0 in the previous visit to Baku in 2013 but O'Neill's team are a much improved outfit four years on having achieved qualification for Euro 2016.
Robert Prosinecki's home side will be able to call on experienced skipper Rashad Sadygov, who missed the Windsor Park contest because of injury.
Brazilian-born striker Richard Almeida is also now part of the Azerbaijan squad while another newcomer Renat Dadashov previously played for Germany's Under-17 team.
O'Neill's side are second in Group C, five points behind leaders Germany, but two ahead of the third-placed Czech Republic.
