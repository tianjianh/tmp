Celtic: Criticism of Ronny Deila is 'nonsense' - Tom Boyd

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Tom Boyd says any suggestions that Ronny Deila should be sacked as Celtic manager are "absolute nonsense".

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The former Celtic captain believes it would be "absolutely ridiculous" to dismiss Deila with his side sitting top of the Premiership.
"It's an absolute nonsense that there's a certain overreaction to a manager who is sitting on top of the league with a game in hand." Boyd told BBC Scotland.
"There seems to be a furore of negativity surrounding the manager."
Celtic sit top of the league on goal difference from Aberdeen - who defeated the champions last week to bring the title race to life - having played a game fewer.
The loss at Pittodrie followed defeat in the League Cup semi-final to Ross County for Deila's side, and Sunday's uninspiring Scottish Cup win over part-timers East Kilbride did little to quell the Norwegian's critics.
However Boyd, who won three league championships with the Parkhead side, thinks removing the manager while the team are still in the hunt for trophies would be a mistake.
"A couple of games ago he got manager of the month for producing a team who scored a hell of a lot of goals in three games.
"We've got a great chance of winning another Double and can you imagine, if that was to be the case, sacking our manager? How would that go well for anybody coming in to take control of the football club, that your remit is to win a Treble every year? I think it's absolutely ridiculous."
"Aberdeen have done exceptionally well. They've got a great run of consistency, players who are playing well. That's been Celtic's problem this year."
Dons manager Derek McInnes told BBC Radio Scotland's Sportsound programme that managers at the top level always expect to come in for criticism, especially when managing a club with the demands of Celtic.
"Being a Celtic manager I think you have to expect that sometimes," McInnes said.
"I don't think we're ever as good as people say we are when we win; I don't think we're ever as poor as we are when we don't win.
"I think we are in an industry where we expect to be criticised. If we don't expect to be criticised then we probably shouldn't be in it.
"You're never going to please everybody."
