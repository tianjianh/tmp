Kent paceman Matt Coles ripped through the hosts' batting line-up at the Ageas Bowl with 6-56 as Hampshire were bowled out for 229 - Adam Wheater hitting 63.
Bell-Drummond shared an opening stand of 203 with Denly before he was caught by Tom Alsop off Brad Wheal (4-38).
Denly (105) went four balls later as Kent reached 231-5 in 43.3 overs.
Kent looked all but home with 27 needed and 10 wickets standing, but Wheal sparked a dramatic collapse in which the visitors lost five quick wickets - the teenage fast bowler taking four of them.
However, there was to be no remarkable turnaround as Alex Blake and Will Gidman knocked off the remaining 14 runs required.
Before the chaotic ending, England Lions batsman Bell-Drummond had once again looked at ease at the crease, a day after scoring an unbeaten 171 for his country against Sri Lanka A.
The 22-year-old continued his prolific summer, hitting 10 boundaries as he brought up his third half-century of the competition.
Denly was equally impressive in making his second hundred in this season's One-Day Cup off 120 balls, before he was caught by Sean Ervine off Wheal.
Kent move up to fourth in the South Group, while Hampshire are two points behind in eighth.
