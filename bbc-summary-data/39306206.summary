Half of the work is intended as a Champions League legacy, with the city hosting this year's final, with the money coming from the council's budget.
Work will see changing rooms refurbished, new playground equipment installed and a drainage scheme for Thornhill's football pitch.
Councillor Peter Bradbury said the quality of public facilities can impact on people exercising.
Changing rooms will be refurbished at Trelai Park and Rumney Recreation Ground and a playground in Lisvane will be expanded.
Seven other playgrounds across the city will also be refurbished.
