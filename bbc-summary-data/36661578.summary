Powys grass cutting problems 'urgent action' promised

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Urgent action has been promised after budget cuts and problems with a contractor left grass in many areas of Powys uncut.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The council said a Â£350,000 reduction in ground maintenance money would have a "visible" impact.
But a new contractor is "behind schedule" and this exacerbated things.
Powys is the second local authority to experience issues with grass cutting after Gwynedd council was criticised earlier this month.
Under new arrangements, municipal areas should be cut 10 times a year and highway verges once in rural areas and three times in urban areas.
"The consequence of budget cuts of the scale faced by the service was always going to be visible in our communities," councillor John Brunt said.
But he said a new contract had seen work fall "behind schedule" and "below the standard anticipated".
"We have raised the issue with the company at the highest level and have been assured that urgent action will be taken," he said.
