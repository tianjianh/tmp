Greenock Morton 3-1 St Mirren

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Greenock Morton claimed their first competitive win over Renfrewshire rivals St Mirren in 17 years to move up to fourth in the Scottish Championship.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Thomas O'Ware headed in Ross Forbes' free-kick to put Morton ahead on the quarter-hour mark.
And Forbes soon doubled the lead with a firmly struck left-foot shot.
Gary Oliver netted from another Forbes assist midway through the second half and the bottom-placed Buddies replied through Ben Gordon late on.
Morton edge ahead of Queen of the South on goal difference while St Mirren remain three points adrift of Saturday's opponents Dumbarton.
The hosts' early dominance was rewarded when Forbes found centre-back O'Ware free in the six-yard box to head his sixth goal of the season past Jamie Langfield.
The home side's front four of Forbes, Oliver, Aidan Nesbitt and Jai Quitongo were giving the visiting defence a torrid time and it was no surprise when Jim Duffy's men doubled their lead.
Quitongo, who has been called into the Scotland Under-21 squad for the match with Slovakia, came up with a sensational flick to beat Gordon, laid the ball into the path of Oliver who found Forbes free in the box and the winger coolly dispatched his fifth goal of the season.
Oliver, who also had an effort ruled out for offside, latched on to another Forbes pass and produced a sensational right-foot strike from the edge of the box for Morton's third.
Gordon nodded in a late consolation, but it was still a joyous and momentous night for the home fans in the 3,378 crowd.
