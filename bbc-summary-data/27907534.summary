[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Four Ceredigion primary schools will close despite a last-minute call to give one of them extra time to find more pupils, councillors have decided.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Trefilan school will shut after parents agreed to transfer their children to Dihewyd school six miles (10km) away.
Ceredigion council also voted to close Llanafan primary school after a motion to keep it open was defeated.
Llanddewi Brefi and Tregaron primaries will be replaced with a community school based at Tregaron High School.
Pupils are due to move to new school in time for September 2015.
Supporters of the 24-pupil Llanafan primary packed the gallery of the council chamber in Aberaeron.
After the vote, the chair of the school's support group, Byron Jenkins, said they were "devastated" at the vote.
He said a meeting is to be held on Thursday evening to discuss what steps to take next, and that the group had not ruled out calling for a judicial review of the plans.
In April, the parents of 13 children at Trefilan school agreed to move them to Dihewyd following a meeting between Ceredigion council bosses and representatives of both schools.
