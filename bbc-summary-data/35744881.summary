Ebanks-Landell, 23, who came off after just 19 minutes against Boro, could be out for up to 12 weeks after surgery.
"He's fractured a metatarsal. That's effectively his season finished," head coach Kenny Jackett told BBC WM.
"I feel for him as he's been looking for that breakthrough. And he's picked it up at just the wrong time."
Jackett added: "This is his longest run in the team. It's come when he was looking to push on, build on what he's done and get the experience he needs to progress."
Injury-hit Wolves are still without Mike Williamson, but they do have fellow defender Kortney Hause available as a ready-made replacement.

"Mike Williamson won't be back for these next two games, against Bristol City and Birmingham City on Sunday," said Jackett. "But Kortney came on as a sub on the left side the other night. And that's his natural position.
"He's used to Danny Batth as they played together earlier in the season. He's had a game and a half back and is ready to step in. "
Ebanks-Landell's broken fifth metatarsal is the latest long-term addition to the club's injury list, Wolves having also lost Nouha Dicko (knee), Razak Boukari (knee), Dave Edwards (metatarsal) and Jordan Graham (knee), as well as James Henry (hamstring) and Mike Williamson (hip) with muscle injuries.
However, Poland international forward Michal Zyro is expected to be available for selection, probably on the bench, to face Bristol City on Tuesday night, a little ahead of schedule after six weeks out following a calf problem.
"Michal Zyro we'd expect to be available for selection," said Jackett.
Kenny Jackett was talking to BBC WM's Rob Gurney.
