Mike Ashley pursues SFA over Rangers fine and Dave King appointment

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Newcastle United owner Mike Ashley is challenging decisions by the Scottish Football Association (SFA) which relate to his involvement with Rangers.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The first relates to a Â£7,500 SFA fine in March over a breach of their rules on dual interest in football clubs.
He is also challenging an SFA decision to pass Dave King as "fit and proper" to become Rangers chairman despite his tax convictions in South Africa.
Both judicial review cases will be heard at the Court of Session in 2016.
Mr Ashley's Â£7,500 fine was for contravening the SFA's dual-ownership regulations.
The Sports Direct billionaire fell foul of the SFA's disciplinary rule number 19 which states that no person who has a formal interest in one club can have a similar role in another side.
Lawyers acting for Mr Ashley claim the SFA acted incorrectly and are seeking a judicial review into the SFA's decision.
The second case is brought by Mr Ashley's company, MASH Holdings Limited, who wish the SFA's decision to declare Mr King a "fit and proper" person to be judicially reviewed.
The company is the ownership mechanism in which Mike Ashley holds his shares in Rangers.
Mr King had to be ratified by the SFA due to his tax convictions in South Africa.
The businessman admitted to 41 breaches of the South African Income Tax Act and agreed to pay a Â£43.7m settlement in 2013 following a legal battle.
Lawyers for MASH claim the SFA's decision was wrong and that Mr King is not a fit and proper person to be involved with a football club.
