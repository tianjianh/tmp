Drivers are being warned of disruption after Bath and North East Somerset Council announced it was temporarily closing a major route in Keynsham.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
As part of essential work to repair Durley Lane bridge, the A4 Keynsham bypass will be shut from midnight to 06:00 BST on Sunday.
A council spokesman said the bypass was closing to allow the installation of a new contraflow.
"Essential repair work" to re-waterproof the deck began on 16 March.
A council spokesman said the contraflow would "allow full access" to the eastbound side of the dual carriageway for the re-waterproofing works, following completion of the westbound side.
The contraflows are expected to be in place for six weeks - three weeks per side - and there will be a signposted diversion through Keynsham.
The council warned that a further night closure would be required to remove the contraflow at the end of the works by the end of May.
