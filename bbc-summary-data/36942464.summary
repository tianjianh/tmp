Quins have not disclosed the length of the 21-year-old South African's deal at the Twickenham Stoop.
"Cameron is a tough, uncompromising, physical individual who will create real competition for places," director of rugby John Kingston said.
"He has been signed with a mind that he will be challenging hard for a starting berth in the not too distant future."
