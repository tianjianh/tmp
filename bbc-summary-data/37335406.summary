Theresa May has announced she wants schools to be given the right to apply to select pupils by ability, as well as allowing grammar schools to expand.
MPs will question Education Secretary Justine Greening about the plans with several high profile Tory backbenchers having already voiced their opposition.
Labour has said the plans will "entrench inequality".
The government says the use of quotas for places will ensure pupils from poorer families are not squeezed out by those from a middle-class background.
But the overwhelming view of education experts is that poorer children would still lose more overall.
BBC education editor Branwen Jeffreys said the government could struggle to get the plans through parliament with divisions within the Conservative party already becoming apparent.
"Several high profile Tory backbenchers have already made clear their dismay at the plans," she said.
"The debate will also be watched with interest by academy trusts which run most secondary schools in England - many are uneasy about the plans.
"And in Northern Ireland too, where grammar school education has just been given renewed political backing by the DUP education secretary."
In a major speech last week which marked the beginning of her so-called social reform agenda, the prime minister said: "The truth is that we already have selection in our school system - and it's selection by house price, selection by wealth. That is simply unfair.
"We are effectively saying to poorer and some of the most disadvantaged children in our country that they can't have the kind of education their richer counterparts can enjoy."
But Ofsted's chief inspector Michael Wilshaw said the changes would undo years of progress.
He and several teaching unions have said the plans represent social mobility for a few bright children at the expense of the majority who would be in schools that would suffer from the knock-on impact.
Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said his party would block the proposals in the House of Lords.
"Fundamentally, it's the same as the old 11-plus system, in that it is dividing children on the basis of their perceived ability at the age of 11," he said.
"I don't think that's a good message for our children."
In summary: main proposals
