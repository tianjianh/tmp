A kit which allows people to experience what it is like to have dementia has been introduced in Aberdeen.

Workshops are being held at the the city's Royal Cornhill Hospital using specially modified goggles, gloves and other equipment to simulate symptoms.
It is aimed at carers and those who have friends or relatives affected by the condition.
Staff say the equipment frequently leaves people with a completely new understanding of the disease.
Participants are asked to fulfil basic tasks such as getting into bed, writing their name or buttoning up clothing.
Julia Wells, an older adults mental health nurse consultant with NHS Grampian, said: "With the number of people living with the disease expected to double over the next 10 years, it's vital that we do everything we can to raise awareness of dementia.
"Dementia Awareness Week in general and workshops offer a great platform to do just that.
"It also helps to reduce some of the stigma that still exists around the disease."
