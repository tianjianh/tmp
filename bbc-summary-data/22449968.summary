Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy star Gary Oldman and Oscar-winning actress Marion Cotillard have starring roles in the latest video from David Bowie.

The video is for The Next Day, taken from his comeback album of the same name.
It depicts Bowie as a messianic figure, dressed in a robe and fronting a band in a basement bar.
Oldman plays a priest who dances with Cotillard before she bleeds from stigmata marks on her palms.
Bowie's last video, for The Stars (Are Out Tonight), featured another Oscar-winner, Tilda Swinton.
The new film was directed by photographer Floria Sigismondi and features characters dressed as clergymen amid heavy religious imagery.
As it ends with the characters arranged in a tableau, Bowie says: "Thank you Gary, thank you Marion, thank you everybody."
Oldman previously worked with Bowie in the 1990s when they performed a duet on guitarist Reeves Gabrels' 1995 album The Sacred Squall of Now.
