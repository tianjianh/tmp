A speed-reading 10-year-old has finished the new Harry Potter story in just 59 minutes.

Toby L'Estrange, from Wheathampstead, Hertfordshire, was asked by a firm for its first review of Harry Potter and the Cursed Child - Parts I & II.
Toby said he can read 400-page books in under two hours, after his speed-reading expert grandmother taught him.
His verdict on the book was that it is a "very complicated story", giving it six out of 10.
He completed it within the hour after the book was downloaded to his e-reader, just after midnight on Sunday.
The latest instalment of the Harry Potter stories is the script of a new original story by JK Rowling, John Tiffany and Jack Thorne.
Also written as play, it enjoyed a West End gala opening on Saturday to coincide with the release, where JK Rowling praised fans for keeping the stage show's secrets since previews started in June.
The story takes place several years on from the end of the last Potter book, when Harry is an overworked employee of the Ministry of Magic, a husband and father-of-three.
"It's a really good story. It's a very complicated story," Toby said.
"It happens in different times, so it's really helpful if you know all the other books and characters quite well (I do - and so does any other true Harry Potter fan).
"When I first started it was really difficult to know what was happening because everything was mixed up, but then it all got quite exciting - and a bit (a bit!) clearer.
"And I think you're going to love it."
