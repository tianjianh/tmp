Pond, 31, who joined Fleetwood from Lancaster City in 2003, is the club's all-time record appearance holder.
"It's terrific business and terrific news for us. He epitomises what we want to create within this club," manager Steven Pressley told the club website.
Pressley's side, captained by Pond, finished 19th in the league in 2015-16, five points above the relegation zone.
