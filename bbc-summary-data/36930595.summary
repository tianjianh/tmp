[SN]TITLE[SN]
Bromley 0-2 Tranmere Rovers

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
James Norwood's first-half brace was enough to give Tranmere a 2-0 win at Bromley to start their 2016-17 National League campaign in style.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 25-year-old, who scored 19 goals for the Prenton Park outfit last year, got Rovers off to a dream start after nine minutes, firing past Alan Julian from Connor Jennings' pinpoint cross.
Blair Turgott missed a gilt-edged chance to equalise for the hosts from six yards after 40 minutes. Tobi Sho-Silva seemingly did all the hard work, ghosting past Tranmere's backline, but the West Ham youth product hit his effort wide.
Four minutes later Norwood made it 2-0, prodding home Andy Cook's flick from Liam Ridehalgh's cross and that was enough for the Merseysiders to make their 500-mile round trip a fruitful one.
