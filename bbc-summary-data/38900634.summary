Police were called to Holy Cross College, in the Melmount Road area, at about 12:40 GMT.
The fight happened in the canteen, where about 600 pupils are believed to have been present.
The Northern Ireland Ambulance Service also attended the scene, but that no-one was taken in for treatment.
Police released the arrested male back into the care of his parents.
The parents of all pupils involved had been contacted and no serious injuries had been reported, police added.
It is understood the fight broke out between two pupils, who were separated and taken outside.
However, about six pupils - who are believed to have been friends of the two pupils - then got involved in another altercation.
A parent said her 14-year-old daughter had been very distressed by what happened.
"She says everybody was scared, running, didn't know what to do or how to get away from the situation," said Eileen Whisker.
She added that her daughter and other pupils had been reduced to tears by the incident.
"She doesn't want to go to school tomorrow," said Ms Whisker.
The school's principal, Maria Doherty, said the police were called in a "supportive role".
"We decided to call the PSNI because of the number of students we had in the canteen and social area at the time and the potential this situation had to escalate," she said.
