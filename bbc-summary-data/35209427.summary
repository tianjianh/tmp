Almost 30 firefighters spent five hours tackling the blaze after it was reported at about 02:15.
Part of the building which houses nursery and P1 classes was damaged.
Aberdeenshire Council said this would not affect teaching, and the school would reopen as planned after the festive holiday on 6 January.
Sgt Sandra Crighton of Police Scotland said a joint investigation with the fire service was at an early stage, with officers "keeping an open mind as to the cause" of the blaze.
Appealing for any witnesses to come forward, she added: "The loss of such a key building within the local community is distressing for a number of people, in particular the pupils, parents and staff of the school."
A spokesman for the council thanked the community for its support, and said any further information would be issued directly to parents.
