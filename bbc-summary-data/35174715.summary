The southern Australian city has seen temperatures of more than 40 degrees Celcius - for at least four days.
Motorist Paul Jansen, who filmed the koala said the animal drank from the gutter for more than 15 minutes.
"It didn't mind the attention or the road noise, it was just focused on the drink."
