Reading 2-1 Sheffield Wednesday

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Reading bounced back from last weekend's 5-0 thrashing by Fulham with a 2-1 victory over fellow play-off hopefuls Sheffield Wednesday.

The Royals dominated first-half possession but struggled to create clear-cut chances.
Wednesday's Lucas Joao fired wide after the break before Roy Beerens' deflected shot gave Reading the lead.
Beerens then doubled his side's advantage, before Steven Fletcher's late header set up a tense finish.
Reading's four game winning streak came to an end when they travelled to London last weekend, but their defence looked far more assured against high-flying Wednesday, until a frantic final five minutes.
The Owls, who would have leapfrogged Reading with a win, offered very little going forward in the first period without striker Fernando Forestieri, who was was sent off in their 2-1 win against Preston.
Joao should have given them the lead immediately after the break when he beat the offside trap, only to fire wide from 15 yards.
Dutch winger Beerens then punished Wednesday with a lucky deflected shot and a superb strike after substitute Yann Kermorgant's headed assist.
Reading looked to have the game all wrapped up before Wednesday substitute Fletcher headed home in stoppage time.
And Scotsman Fletcher could have stolen a point with seconds remaining but Ali Al-Habsi's superb fingertip save denied the Owls a comeback.
Reading manager Jaap Stam (on FA Cup tie against Manchester United): "We haven't even spoken to the team about the draw. It's not even relevant to speak about it because it's in about a month or so.
"We still need to play five games in the league before we play that game with United. So for us, it's no discussion.
"The league at the moment is much more important for us than the game against United. Our focus is on the games that we need to do well in the league.
"We were not happy after that game (at Fulham) and how we performed. But that sometimes makes you aware of what you need to do if you are going to get results in the Championship. That's what we did today."
Sheffield Wednesday head coach Carlos Carvalhal: "There is a saying 'if you don't kill, you can die'. And that's what happened today.
"We prepared very well for the game and we closed down Reading very well. I don't remember any problem for us in the first half.
"We had a clear chance in the second half (Joao), probably the best clear chance of the game. But we didn't shoot the goal.
"In my opinion, we were more threat to them than they were to us. It's important in these games that when you control them, you must score."
