Paedophile jailed after leaving memory card on bus

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A "depraved" paedophile who was caught after mistakenly leaving his camera's memory card on a bus has been jailed.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
In order to return the card to its owner, a man who found it on the bus in Eccles, Greater Manchester last October decided to look at its contents.
After finding a number of sexual images of children, he reported it to police.
Salford man Anthony Jolly, 50, admitted possession of thousands of indecent images of children and was sentenced to three years at Manchester Crown Court.
Among the images were photographs of children which appeared to have been taken from a bedroom window.
Detectives were able to trace the pictures back to Jolly's home address on Rosa Grove, Higher Broughton and arrested him.
A number of electronic devices were seized which contained thousands of indecent images of children.
Det Con Jill Vescovi of Greater Manchester Police said: "Anthony Jolly is a depraved predator who obviously doesn't care and hasn't given a second thought to the children in the images he kept and the impact this abuse will have had on their lives.
"Whilst none of the children who appear in the indecent images were directly abused by Jolly, the downloading and sharing of vile images like this fuel the trade of child sexual abuse."
As well as a jail term, Jolly was also given a sexual harm prevention order.
