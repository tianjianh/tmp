[SN]TITLE[SN]
Wycombe Wanderers 2-1 Grimsby Town

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Anthony Stewart scored an injury-time winner against Grimsby to earn Wycombe Wanderers their first victory since March.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Andrew Boyce's late equaliser had cancelled out Sido Jombati's delicate free-kick, but the home earned all three points in stoppage time.
Wycombe defender Joe Jacobson's free-kick on 13 minutes drew a decent save from James McKeown.
Garry Thompson had another good chance for the hosts on 50 minutes, but wastefully blazed his half-volley wide from 25 yards.
Wycombe led five minutes later, though. Luke Summerfield brought down Jacobson on the edge of the box, and Jombati stepped up to place the ball beyond McKeown for the home side's first goal in 112 days.
Cameron Dawson was forced into a sharp double save after 69 minutes, diving to his right to stop Summerfield's fierce shot, then saving Kayden Jackson's follow-up with his legs.
Ten minutes later, though, Grimsby deservedly equalised when Boyce passed the ball beyond Dawson after Wycombe failed to clear a corner.
But Stewart popped up to tap home from two yards after substitute Adebayo Akinfenwa's flick-on bounced off both posts for Wycombe's first points of the season.
