Philip Bell, from Boston, Lincolnshire, organised for heroin and cocaine to be couriered into the town from Merseyside and West Yorkshire.
He used contacts he met in Hatfield Prison, near Doncaster, to source and supply the drugs, police said.
A further 14 people received jail terms of between two and eight years.
Police forces from across the UK, led by the East Midlands Special Operations Unit, were involved in detecting the conspiracy offences, seizing cash and drugs with a street value of more than Â£1,600,000.
Police said the drugs were distributed in Boston and the surrounding area, with large quantities being sent to Hull.
Speaking after the sentencing at Lincoln Crown Court, Det Insp Paul Myers, of the East Midlands Special Operations Unit, described Bell as "manipulative and amiable" and the "mastermind of the operation".
He said: "Bell manipulated his associates, friends and family - some of which had never been in trouble with the police before."
