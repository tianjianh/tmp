County Championship: Ed Joyce helps Sussex to hold up Worcestershire

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Sussex's former captain Ed Joyce hit 74 at New Road to hold up Worcestershire's hopes of an innings victory after the visitors were forced to follow-on.

Resuming on 192-6, Ben Brown added just six to be out for 55 before Ollie Robinson hit an unbeaten 51 as Sussex totalled 278 in their first innings.
Trailing by 213 runs and put back in by the hosts, Sussex closed on 137-3.
Ed Barnard followed up three Sussex first-innings scalps with Joyce's prized wicket to leave Sussex in peril.
Joyce, now 37, maintained the form which brought him a career-best 250 in last week's Championship match against Derbyshire.
The visitors now go into the final day of the match needing a further 76 runs to make their hosts bat again.
But weather-hit Worcestershire's hopes for a first victory of the season could still be denied if the overnight forecast proves correct. More heavy rain is forecast during the next 24 hours.
Worcestershire paceman Ed Barnard told BBC Hereford & Worcester:
"It is a very flat pitch and we've done very well today to take seven wickets. It was hard going but everyone stuck at it.
"The cracks have started to open up and, if you hit the edge, the ball will go up and down.
"I'm not sure the forecast is great. We've played good cricket this season and not got what we deserved from games but hopefully it can stay fine."
Sussex vice-captain Ben Brown:
"We spoke about showing fight and character. We have done it already this season and we have fought hard again here.
"We didn't want to be in this position but Ollie Robinson this morning took some time out of the game.
"He batted well and Ed Joyce and Luke Wells did really well with their partnership in the second innings."
