Derry judge orders teenager to sketch him in court

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A 16-year-old boy has been ordered by a judge in Northern Ireland to become an unofficial court sketch artist.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The teenager appeared at Londonderry Magistrates' Court after failing a police drugs test on Wednesday. He admitted consuming cannabis before he was arrested.
District Judge Barney McElholm said he would give the boy one last chance because of his love for art.
He must attend court for three days and draw the judge and solicitors.
Mr McElholm said as part of the teenager's bail conditions: "You must bring with you a sketch pad and a pencil and you can draw me and the solicitors for two hours each day.
"Only me and the solicitors, and I will review the matter on Wednesday."
He added: "If you look stoned you will be arrested."
