Ann Maguire, 61, was killed at Corpus Christi Catholic College in Leeds on Monday.
Tributes and flowers were left at the school gates and former pupils earlier attended a Mass for Mrs Maguire.
A 15-year-old pupil is being questioned by detectives, while the school is open as normal.
Det Supt Simon Beldon, of West Yorkshire Police, told a press conference the teenager remained in custody.
He said: "Given his young age this is a process which needs to be handled very sensitively and may take some time to complete.
"This is clearly an unprecedented and tragic incident which has left the wider community in a state of shock."
Mrs Maguire had taught at the school for 40 years, after starting her career there as a student teacher.
Those taught by her said she was an inspirational teacher who went out of her way to help students.
Leading the Mass for Mrs Maguire at Corpus Christi Church, Monsignor Paul Fisher told the congregation: "Yesterday evening, the community gathered here in church as well as outside to light candles and to say a prayer.
"By the time the church was closed, the candelabras were full of light.
"Today we pray for the light of hope. Hope for ourselves that we will come to terms, eventually, with what has happened.
"We pray for all those young people at our school next door and their teachers. We pray for Ann's family and friends. "
Former pupil Stephanie Pemberton spoke after the Mass.
She said: "I'm glad they have done something in memory of her, she gave so much to so many people.
"She was an incredible woman she came in on Saturdays to try to get us through our GCSEs.
"You just have to mention her name and you can't help but smile.
"I didn't believe it at first, I was in complete denial, I didn't want to believe it.
"When someone's had that much effect on your life, it's not an easy thing to accept."
Priest Paul Fisher said: "Messages from those who knew Ann have come from across the country, with at least one from Australia."
