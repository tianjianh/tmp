Labour MPs Sir Kevin Barron (Rother Valley), Sarah Champion (Rotherham) and John Healey (Wentworth and Dearne) have all denied the allegations.
South Yorkshire Police said it was in the early stages of an inquiry into alleged expenses fraud in Rotherham during the 2015 general election.
It is assessing whether the deadline for investigations can be extended.
"Officers are currently collating information to assess whether an application for an extension to the 12-month parameters on the time to investigate could be obtained from the courts," the force said.
Sir Kevin, who is chairman of the House of Commons standards committee, said: "All my elections expenses were declared within the law and the rules set out by the Electoral Commission."
Mr Healey said: "These allegations are simply wrong. My expenses for the 2015 general election were reported fully in accordance with the law and the rules set out by the Electoral Commission."
Ms Champion has not yet responded to requests for a comment from the BBC.
