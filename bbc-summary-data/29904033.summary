A family statement read: "She is having the best care possible and we are hopeful of a full recovery.
"We would like to thank everyone that has been so supportive."
Newsbeat understands that Claudia was with her eight-year-old daughter, Matilda, when the accident happened.
Exact details of what took place haven't been released but it's feared Matilda suffered burns.
Claudia Winkleman used the statement to warn others of the dangers of using or handling fireworks, especially at this time of year.
"We would like to remind anyone taking part in fireworks parties or Guy Fawkes celebrations to be vigilant about the dangers of candles, open fires and fireworks," she said.
"Please have the appropriate safety measures in place and to hand."
The star also thanked the medical team who were looking after daughter, "particularly the NHS doctors, nurses and staff who have been absolutely incredible."
A spokesperson for the London Ambulance Service said that a child was taken to hospital after being called to a London address on Friday evening.
"We sent an ambulance crew, a single responder by car and an advanced paramedic to the scene," said the spokesperson.
"We treated a child and took her to hospital as a priority."
London Fire Brigade also warned about the dangers of open flames.
Deputy Commissioner Rita Dexter said: "I hope Claudia's daughter has a speedy recovery after this ordeal.
"It's a shocking but timely reminder that open flames can be lethal if you don't keep an eye on them or they are left unattended.
"Make sure candles are placed well away from flammable items and clothing, otherwise the results can be catastrophic."
This year Claudia Winkleman replaced Sir Bruce Forsyth as one of the main presenters on Strictly Come Dancing.
The 42-year-old had previously fronted the Strictly spin-off, Strictly Come Dancing: It Takes Two.
Zoe Ball presented the weekend's Strictly alongside Tess Daly and will appear on this weekend's show again in Claudia's place.
It's not known when Claudia will return to the show.
