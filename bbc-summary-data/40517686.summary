Police appeal for help to solve missing finger mystery

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Police are asking for the public's help to solve the mystery of a human finger found in London nearly seven years ago.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The single digit was discovered in Woburn Walk, Bloomsbury, by a dog.
Officers found no more remains and the DNA profile does not match anyone on the missing persons database.
Police also examined if it came from the 7/7 London terrorist attack in 2005 but no link was found to the victims or survivors of the bus bomb in nearby Tavistock Square.
The finger was found in the rear courtyard of an unused shop in December 2010 and the DNA analysis showed it belonged to a man.
Det Con Tom Boon said: "We have now exhausted all lines of inquiry and have been unable to find out who the finger belongs to and how the finger became detached in the first place.
"It is quite the mystery.
"If anyone has any information, no matter how small or insignificant they think it is, we would urge them to contact us.
"It would be great to be able to find out who the finger belongs to after all these years."
