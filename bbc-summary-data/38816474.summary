[SN]TITLE[SN]
Prosecutors to consider Sussex PCC Katy Bourne 'false statement'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Prosecutors are to decide whether the Sussex Police and Crime Commissioner (PCC) should face charges over allegations she made a false statement.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) has completed an investigation into claims against Katy Bourne during last year's PCC election.
Its report has now been passed to the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS).
In a statement, Ms Bourne's office said it would be "inappropriate to comment" until the matter was concluded.
"The office is aware the IPCC has passed its report into this complaint to the CPS," it said.
It is alleged Ms Bourne made a false statement during the 2016 election regarding her expenses while serving as the PCC.
An IPCC spokesman said: "A referral to the CPS is made when the IPCC investigation indicates that a criminal offence may have been committed.
"It does not mean that criminal charges will necessarily follow."
