The room of eight-year-old Chloe McCance was ransacked during the incident at Sinclair Avenue in Bangor, County Down, on Friday.
A laptop computer containing the last pictures of Chloe was taken, as well as Christmas presents.
Her mother, Lynda McCance, has appealed for the return of the computer.
Chloe, who had the rare degenerative illness, Batten's Disease, died earlier this month.
Ms McCance described the family's shock at discovering the burglary.
"We went out on Friday, we were getting tribute tattoos done, and we came home and we just sat down because we had got a takeaway," she said.
"I went into the hall and discovered her bedroom door was open which just wasn't right because we have not been in that room since her funeral and we went out the back and discovered the back gate had been unlocked.
"We discovered our laptop was gone, a bag of groceries gone, Christmas presents taken, and the drawers had been gone through.
"To think somebody has trespassed and went into her room and seen everything and just done what they have done to us.
"We can't believe that after everything we have been through that it could get any worse."
