Leyton Orient striker Chris Dagnall has rejected a new deal at the League Two club to join Indian Super League side Kerala Blasters.

Dagnall, who netted 11 league goals in 2014-15, was one of the players new head coach Ian Hendon wanted to keep.
But the 29-year-old said he wanted to try something different.
He told Orient's website: "I've enjoyed my 18 months with the club and the fans were very welcoming, but this will be a new challenge for me."
The former Rochdale and Scunthorpe striker added: "It will be a completely new environment, country and culture but (a challenge) I look forward to."
He will be working under former England Under-21 boss Peter Taylor who took over as boss of Kerala after replacing ex-England goalkeeper David James.
Dagnall joined the O's from Barnsley during the January 2014 transfer window and scored 20 goals in 62 appearances.
He is the second striker to leave the club this summer following Kevin Lisbie, who moved across London to join promoted Barnet.
