More than 40 firefighters tackled the blaze that caused extensive damage at Leyland Warriors in Moss Side Way, Lancashire, at about 02:00 BST.
The repairs will take months, the club says, affecting more than 200 players.
Lancashire Fire and Rescue Service said no-one was hurt, but it is believed the fire was "started deliberately".
Head coach Phil Roberts said everybody was "in a state of shock" after the fire.
Leyland Warriors play in the second division of the North West Men's League.
