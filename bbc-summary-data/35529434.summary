[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Hull City extended their lead at the top of the Championship with a goalless draw against promotion rivals Brighton.

In a quiet first half, Tom Huddlestone came closest to breaking the deadlock when he forced a save out of David Stockdale with a long-range effort.
Tomer Hemed looked to have put Albion ahead when he turned in Anthony Knockaert's ball, but he was offside.
Sam Clucas almost snatched three points for the Tigers but Stockdale did well to push his fierce shot on to the bar.
Hull are now two points clear at the top, but they did not capitalise on second-placed Middlesbrough's draw with Leeds United on Monday.
Brighton, who have never won at the KC Stadium, moved above Burnley into third place and are now just a point off the automatic promotion places.

"Fair play to Brighton, they have come and worked very hard and frustrated us.
"When you get a point away from home you are going to be happy with that. They have come with a game plan and it's worked very well.
"We didn't play well enough tonight and that's going to happen. We take the point and move on."
Brighton boss Chris Hughton:

"We played a different system. I was pleased in Inigo Calderon and Steve Sidwell, I was really pleased with both of them.
"At any stage of the season against these it's a good result. I think on the balance of play and the chances, I think we deserved it.
"You want to make it a tight game and the chances are going to be minimal."
