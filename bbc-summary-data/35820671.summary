[SN]TITLE[SN]
Brazil's Lula to be President Rousseff's chief of staff

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Brazil's former president, Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, will become the new chief of staff for President Dilma Rousseff.

The move shields Lula from possible prosecution by a federal judge investigating a massive corruption scandal named Operation Car Wash.
Under Brazilian law, cabinet members can only be tried by the Supreme Court.
Lula was questioned two weeks ago over allegations of money laundering connected to Operation Car Wash.
He says the allegations are aimed at preventing him from running for president again in 2018.
Lula flew to the capital, Brasilia, on Tuesday for talks with President Rousseff. After a four-hour meeting, they agreed to reconvene on Wednesday.
Lawmaker Jose Guimaraes of the governing Workers' Party, to which both Lula and President Rousseff belong, tweeted (in Portuguese) that current chief of staff Jaques Wagner had "shown greatness and selflessness on the day of his birthday" and ceded his post to Lula.
The former leader's appointment was confirmed later in a statement issued by Ms Rousseff.
He is expected to be sworn in next week, Brazilian media reported.
As chief of staff, Lula is expected to lead the fight against moves in Congress to impeach President Rousseff over allegations she manipulated Brazil's account books to hide a growing deficit.
Analysts say President Rousseff is hoping that Lula will use his political nous and influence with members of Congress to block impeachment proceedings.
The two politicians have been close for decades. Lula was Ms Rousseff's political mentor and she is his hand-picked successor.
On 4 March, Lula was briefly detained and questioned over allegations of money laundering connected to Operation Car Wash, a massive investigation into corruption at the state oil giant, Petrobras.
Prosecutors have since filed fraud and money laundering charges against him. However, the charges have yet to be accepted by a judge.
The case has been transferred to federal judge Sergio Moro, who is in charge of Operation Car Wash.
But if Lula is confirmed as a cabinet member, Judge Moro will not be able to investigate or try him.
Lula has consistently denied any wrongdoing and alleges the allegations are politically motivated.
He confirmed this week that he intends to run for president in the 2018 elections.
