Eddie Jones full of praise for 14-man England after they beat Argentina

Eddie Jones praised England's game management after they overcame Elliot Daly's early red card to beat Argentina and record a 13th successive win.

Winger Daly, 24, was sent-off after five minutes for tackling a player in the air in an incident-packed game that saw the Pumas reduced to 14 late on.
"There was enough drama in the game to fill 10 episodes of EastEnders", said England boss Jones after the 27-14 win.
"It was a brilliant display. Flexible, adaptable, courageous."
Despite Daly's red card, for taking out Leonardo Senatore, England opened up a 16-0 lead, but tries from Facundo Isa and Santiago Cordero cut the gap to two points.
A Jonny May score pulled England clear with Argentina's Enrique Pieretto also sent off for a stamp on Joe Marler.
"We went out with a certain game plan but had to abandon it after five minutes," added Jones.
"The players did exceptionally well, the senior players regrouped and came up with another plan and played to the conditions and I thought it was outstanding."
It was England's 12th win from 12 games under Australian Jones and sets them up for next Saturday's visit of his home country when another victory would equal their longest winning run of 14 games, set across 2002-03.
Australia were on course for a northern hemisphere grand slam, but lost 27-24 to Ireland in Dublin on Saturday.
England, unbeaten in 2016, whitewashed Michael Cheika's side 3-0 in the summer and Jones has criticised the Wallabies' scrummaging.
"We are looking forward to Australia next week. It is going to be a bit of fun because the Australian media last June was very disrespectful to us," Jones said.
"I am sure that they are going to be at that again, so we have got to be prepared for that, and I am very keen to have a chat to the referee about the Australian scrummaging.
"They have got some issues with the way that they scrum so we need to have a meeting with the referee and we will invite the Australian coaching staff to come along."
He added:  "I am not going to sort them out for them. The best win is to come, Australia will be the best win."
Jones said he had no issues with Daly after his sending off. The 24-year-old Wasps player was making just his third England start in his eighth appearance.
"Elliot made a judgement error," said Jones. "We all make them. These things happen and you have to get on with it.
"He has to bounce back, he has no choice. What is he going to do, sit in the corner and feel sorry for himself and never play rugby again?
"No one holds any recrimination against him and I don't understand the questioning on this. I have probably had five words with him saying just get on with it, there's nothing else to say."

Elliot Daly was enthusiastic and chasing the ball hard. He made eye contact with the man in the air and got his arms wrapped around him. There was only going to be one outcome.
Argentina couldn't take advantage. England spent a lot of time defending but Argentina played in the wrong area of the pitch and conceded easy penalties to let England score at will.
Eddie Jones used the bench well and England were able to walk away from it.
After going down to 14 men, England will be very happy to come out with a win. They have been on a fantastic run but there is so much more to come from this group.
I think they will beat Australia next week, they are so confident and can take a lot out of this performance.
