The 35-year-old former Sweden international moved to Old Trafford on a free transfer in the summer, with the option of extending his deal for a second season.
He has scored eight goals in 17 games in all competitions this term.
Mourinho said: "We are going to execute the option of a second season. After that he can do what he wants."
Ibrahimovic said: "I feel in shape, feel fresh and good. If I feel like I do now, it will be a second year."
Ibrahimovic, who scored 62 goals in 116 games for Sweden before retiring from international football in June, left French champions Paris St-Germain at the end of last season.
The former Ajax, Juventus, Inter Milan, Barcelona and AC Milan forward has won a trophy every season since 2001, including 13 league titles.
He will have a statue erected in Stockholm in his honour after being named Sweden's top player for a 10th successive year on Monday.
