Tiger Woods urged to 'climb a mountain' & 'find a magical guru'

Tiger Woods has lost the "desire and energy" to "climb back up the mountain" and rediscover his best form as a golfer, his former swing coach says.

Woods, 39, announced an indefinite break from the game this week.
Hank Haney, who spent six years with the 14-time major champion, told BBC Radio 5 live that Woods had "no choice" but to withdraw from competitive golf.
"Whatever the reason, he definitely has not practised like he did earlier in his career - and it shows," Haney said.
"Make no mistake about it, this is not a bump, this is not a hill... this is a mountain he has to climb to get anywhere near back to where he was.
"Has he lost the desire and energy? I don't think there is any doubt. Who knows when we'll see him again?"
Haney said injuries and having two young children had impacted on Woods.
He also claimed "big, big issues" in the former world number one's game meant the decision to take time out was "pretty predictable".
BBC golf commentator Peter Alliss believes Woods needs "a guru" to rediscover his magic on the course.
"Tiger might go to India like the Beatles and discover something magical," said Alliss, who hoped Woods would remain a force in the game
"He'd be a huge miss. He's been a giant in a land of Lilliputians for years."

Woods has begun his break from golf at Beaver Creek in Colorado, where he is supporting girlfriend Lindsey Vonn as she competes in the Alpine Skiing World Championships.
The American missed the cut at the Phoenix Open at the end of last month with an 11-over-par 82 - the worst round of his professional career - and finished last of a field of 132.
Woods, who has not won a major in seven years, also withdrew from last week's event at Torrey Pines in California after just 12 holes, citing a back problem.
"I need a lot of work on my game and to spend time with people that are important to me," Woods said earlier this week.
However, he indicated on his website that he could return as early as the Honda Classic, which starts on 26 February.
Alliss, 83, says he is at a loss to explain the reasons behind the recent decline of Woods but only wants him to return if he can banish his problems.
"I'd like him to finish and play well," said Alliss. "I don't want him to remember him hitting 82 and walking off courses in a wounded state."
Paul Azinger, 55, has urged fellow American Woods to take a back-to-basics approach and stop over-thinking his swing.
Azinger told USA Today: "What Tiger has done is sacrifice a winning swing at the altar for a quest for the perfect swing. And a perfect swing doesn't exist."
