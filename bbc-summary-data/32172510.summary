[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
People travelling by rail over Easter should "think twice", Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin has said.

He told the Evening Standard large-scale rail engineering work may make journeys more difficult.
Several major rail routes are affected, particularly the London to Scotland West Coast main line, parts of Kent and lines running through Reading.
The RAC says four million motorists will be travelling on Good Friday and some 4.5 million on Easter Sunday.
Arriva Trains says passengers in Wales will face delays if travelling to London due to engineering works.
"There will be alternatives and we've lifted almost all motorway roadworks to help," Mr McLoughlin said.
"But if you are travelling between Friday and Monday night please check your journey first, it may be that you'll think twice about how you travel.
"I'm sorry if it is more difficult - but my promise is that the work is essential and when it's done the benefits will be worthwhile."
He also said "an army of 14,000 workers" would be working around the clock over the Easter weekend to upgrade lines.
Network Rail has promised to try and prevent a repeat of the rail chaos which occurred at Christmas.
An overrunning engineering project shut the line between Reading and London Paddington at the end of last year.
Julian Burnell, from Network Rail, said  work on the Reading station redevelopment, in its last major stage, was a "very big project, dealing with one of the biggest bottlenecks anywhere in the country".
He added: "I can't say there's absolutely no danger [of an overrun at Easter], but we have done everything in our power to get it finished in good time. There are hundreds of buses waiting if that happens."
Work on the railways this Easter includes:
As a result of the work being undertaken, Virgin is "strongly recommending" that passengers do not travel between Good Friday and Easter Monday.
And speaking of the work being carried out at Watford, Network Rail route managing director Martin Frobisher said: "There is never a good time to carry out this type of work but we have liaised closely with the train operators to plan for it to take place at a quieter time on the railway."
On the roads, Highways England - formerly the Highways Agency - said more than 550 miles of roadworks will be lifted over Easter on England's motorways and major A roads.
According to traffic information company Trafficmaster, the top five busiest stretches of road over Easter are likely to be:
Breakdown company Green Flag said 54,000 callouts were expected over the weekend, with one puncture every minute.  It said the M4 was likely to be one of the worst-congested roads.
Some 16 million cars are expected to take to the roads over Easter.
Gatwick Airport will see some 480,000 passengers between Good Friday and Easter Monday - an increase of about 11% on Easter last year.
