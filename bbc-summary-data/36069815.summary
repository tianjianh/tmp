A teenage boy with a "morbid interest in horror" has admitted stabbing a woman to death.

Susan Mitchelson, 45, was found with more than 50 stab wounds at her home in Northumberland in November.
Newcastle Crown Court heard the boy, 16, who cannot be named for legal reasons, suffered serious mental health issues and believed he was a demon.
He was sentenced to a hospital order after admitting manslaughter with diminished responsibility.
The court heard the boy suffered from several mental health issues, including schizophrenia and had sought help for two years, but it had been "to no avail".
Judge Paul Sloan QC said the boy had a "morbid interest in horror, death and killing" and was under the "delusional belief" he was a demon.
A statement from the boy's family, which was read out in court, said: "The death maybe could have been prevented if healthcare professionals connected with him had listened to our concerns due to his increasing mental state and aggressive behaviour."
They claimed that instead he was just given an increased dose of medication for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).
Mark Guiliani, prosecuting, said after the attack in November the boy was seen sitting on a park bench by a member of the public, who described him as looking in shock.
When police arrived he told them what had happened and said the knives were in a nearby bin.
Mr Guiliani said he had become "addicted to the internet" and would visit sites which shared horror and paranormal stories and asked users to submit their own.
The court heard medical evidence that the boy heard voices in his head and imagined people being decapitated and killed.
Jamie Hill QC, defending, said there would be a full inquiry by social and community mental health services into what had happened.
Judge Sloan described the boy as "an extremely dangerous individual" who would remain so for the "foreseeable future".
