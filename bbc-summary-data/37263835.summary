[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Dundee and Kilmarnock took a point apiece from their Scottish Premiership meeting at Dens Park.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Faissal El Bakhtaoui struck his first Dundee goal following a pass from Dark Blues debutant Tom Hateley.
However, an overhead kick by Souleymane Coulibaly brought Killie level before the break.
The hosts finished with 10 men after Kevin Gomis was dismissed for a foul on Charlee Adams, who was taken off on a stretcher.

The home side began in great style and, after a period of persistent pressure, eventually broke through the Killie rearguard.
Hateley, having joined as a free agent on Monday, swung in a free-kick from the right-hand side that was not cleared and summer signing El Bakhtaoui hammered the ball into the roof of the net from the edge of the six-yard box.
Paul McGowan was pulling all the strings for Dundee and along with Cammy Kerr set up a chance for Mark O'Hara, who missed by inches as Dundee chased a second.
Kilmarnock slowly began to ease their way into the game and Kris Boyd, who decided to play following the death of his younger brother this week, had a couple of half-chances off target before the Rugby Park side equalised in stunning fashion.
There appeared to be little danger as Luke Hendrie floated in a deep cross but Coulibaly thought otherwise and his acrobatic kick ended up in the opposite corner of the net with goalkeeper Scott Bain rooted to his line.
That goal proved decisive, as did a magnificent double save from Jamie MacDonald to deny Dundee striker Craig Wighton.
With eight minutes left the home side were reduced to 10 men.
Defender Gomis was shown a straight red card by referee Don Robertson after a horrific challenge on Killie substitute Adams, who was replaced by George Green.
Despite being a man down it was Dundee who almost secured a winner when El Bakhtaoui flashed a shot from the edge of the box inches over the crossbar.
Dundee manager Paul Hartley: "It was two points dropped this afternoon. Frustration is the word I am looking for. We didn't pass the ball as well in the second half. We weren't clinical enough in the final third.
"I felt El Bakhtaoui was good and was a threat all day. Hateley had a sound debut.
"I think it's a late challenge [by Gomis on Adams] to be honest with you. Now we will be a centre-half down for next week and possibly Darren O'Dea will be out also."
Kilmarnock manager Lee Clark: "Possibly [a draw] could have been the correct result but I'm a little bit disappointed. We had numerous opportunities and scored an unbelievable goal from Coulibaly. I just felt we didn't quite push on in the second half.
"I left it [the decision to play] up to Kris. He is an experienced man and an experienced footballer. It's been a horrendous week. My toughest week as a football manager to deal with this situation.
"We can only support him and his family. He is a local boy from Kilmarnock. He showed great courage. We had a little talk before the game and in a tribute to Kris and his family we get a positive result. Unfortunately we couldn't get three points but it's the mark of the man he wanted to play today."
