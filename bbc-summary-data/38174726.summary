Robbie Neilson: MK Dons agree terms for Hearts boss

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
League One club MK Dons have agreed terms with Hearts for head coach Robbie Neilson.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 36-year-old had talks in Milton Keynes on Tuesday, but was in charge of Hearts for Wednesday's Scottish Premiership 2-0 win over Rangers.
That victory took Hearts up to second in the table, but Neilson joins a side currently 19th in England's third tier.
The ex-Scotland international is expected back in Milton Keynes to finalise personal terms on Friday.
He will be joined at Stadium MK by his assistant Stevie Crawford.
MK Dons have been seeking a new manager since Karl Robinson left by mutual consent in October after six and a half years in the role.
