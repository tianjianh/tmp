Errol McKenzie was shot three times at close range on 11 April 2010, at the Seymour Road playing fields, Leyton.
Detectives said there was still no obvious motive for the 37-year-old's murder.
He is known to have left Tottenham at 22:45 BST to travel to Leyton that night.
Mr McKenzie was seen on CCTV buying alcohol in a local shop at 23:15 but instead of going to his home a few minutes away, he headed to the park.
Det Ch Insp Dave Whellams said it was still not known how Mr McKenzie travelled back to Leyton.
He added: "Was Errol due to meet someone that night in the park? He was there for at least half-an-hour before he was found dead.
"I would ask anyone who saw Errol on his journey that night to get in touch."
Mr McKenzie was well-known locally and nicknamed "Cable Guy" or "Cable Man" because of his job fixing cable boxes and electrical equipment.
A take away food carton, the alcohol he bought and a carrier bag containing two cable boxes were found next to his body.
