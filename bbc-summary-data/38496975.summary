The parents of a woman found dead on a houseboat in Kashmir in 2013 say they fear they will never get justice.

Twenty-four-year-old Sarah Groves from Guernsey was found dead on the boat she shared with a local family in Srinagar in April 2013.
Dutchman Richard de Wit denies her murder.
Sarah's mother, Kate Groves, said the aim was to "raise the profile" of the case as she "may not live to see the outcome".
Mrs Groves said: "I so desperately want to see justice that is done, that the right person is exposed for the absolutely abhorrent brutality that was served on Sarah."
Mr De Witt was charged with her murder in June 2013 and the trial started a month later.
In September 2013 a lack of evidence placed the trial at risk of collapse as the prosecution failed to provide the murder weapon before the court.
Sarah's father Vic Groves said out of 84 hearings only 20 had been productive.
"That's been caused by witnesses not showing up, the accused not being brought to court because of civil unrest or strikes, and the accused has sacked his lawyer four times," he said.
"We have lost 25 hearings because he had no legal representation in court. We've had no witnesses processed since 29 September 2015.
"We just want to know that when we get to the end of the trial, whatever that verdict is, and it could be either, we want to believe it, to trust it. Right now we don't have that level of confidence."
A Foreign Office spokesperson said: "Our sympathies have been with the Groves family since Sarah's tragic death and we will continue to help them however we can.
"We have been providing support to them since her death and are in regular contact, liaising with the Indian authorities on their behalf."
