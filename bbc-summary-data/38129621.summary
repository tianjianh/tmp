The acrobat also broke her arm and briefly lost consciousness, her mother told a Brisbane radio station.
Skinner was performing during the Kooza show at Brisbane's Skygate venue.
"It will take six to 12 weeks to heal, but her arms and legs work, which is the main thing," Anne Skinner said.
She was speaking to radio station River 94.9.
A spokesperson for the Cirque du Soleil show said: "A Kooza performer, Lisa Skinner, was injured during a performance in Brisbane on Sunday afternoon.
"She was transported to a local hospital, where she is receiving the medical care she needs. We are happy to report that Lisa is currently stable and in good condition.
"At this time, our priority is on supporting Lisa and her family so they can focus on her recovery. The thoughts and love from the cast and crew of Kooza are with her."
Skinner, who has toured previously with Cirque du Soleil, was a member of the Australian gymnastics team in the 1996, 2000 and 2004 Olympics.
She won gold at the 1998 Commonwealth Games.
Sunday's performance was halted while Skinner was taken to hospital but the show later resumed.
