Ben Flower's early try was added to by George Williams for the Warriors, with Steve Michaels crossing for Hull FC, who trailed 14-6 at the break.
John Bateman extended the lead but tries from Leon Pryce, Sika Manu and Steve Michaels pushed the hosts ahead.
Josh Charnley levelled it at 24-24 but Marc Sneyd and Smith traded drop goals before Smith added another for the win.
It is the second night in a row in Super League when a late drop-goal has won the game, after Warrington half-back Chris Sandow's kick helped Wire beat Salford by a point.
Warriors half-back Williams scored the pick of Wigan's tries with his silky footwork in a victory that sees last year's beaten Grand Finalists stay third, level on points with Widnes and Warrington above them.
Shaun Wane's side have won all four of their league games, with their only loss in 2016 coming against NRL side Brisbane Broncos in the World Club Series.
The Black and Whites have lost back-to-back games at the KC Stadium after they won their first two games of the season.

"I thought we did enough to get the result but it was not to be. We dominated territory and field position.
"What was disappointing was having so much possession down their end and not getting as much as we could.
"The game was played down their end of the field. I can't knock their efforts but we've got to get better in a couple of areas."
Wigan head coach Shaun Wane:
"We showed some character and I am very proud of all my players, it was an outstanding effort.
"We had virtually no ball in the second half and our completion rate was at 70%.
"The two drop goals were really good ones, but I'm happy because I believe Hull will beat many teams. Teams will come here and get pummelled.
"We are four from four and not played - we will improve for Leeds next week, another challenge and the players are buzzing."
