[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A rare imperial Chinese hat stand found in Wales has sold for £581,000 at auction.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The "nine dragons" ceramic hat stand had been kept on a table in the hallway of a Welsh house since the early 1950s.
It had originally been made for the Qing-era emperor Dauguang in the mid-19th Century but was later converted to a lamp.
The stand sold for more than £280,000 above the £300,000 guide price at Christie's in King Street, London.
