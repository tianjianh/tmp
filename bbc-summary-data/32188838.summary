Explorer Sir Ranulph Fiennes has embarked on his mission to become the oldest Briton to complete the "toughest footrace on Earth" - with help from his Cardiff coach.

The 71 year old set off on the six-day Marathon des Sables (MdS) in Morocco, on Sunday.
He has been put through his paces at Merthyr Mawr sand dunes in Bridgend by ultra-marathon veteran Rory Coleman.
Coleman has completed the MdS 11 times - and more than 800 marathons.
Sir Ranulph, who has had two heart attacks and a double heart bypass, will run 156 miles (250km) in 50C (122F) temperatures in the Sahara.
He hopes to raise Â£2.5m for Marie Curie Cancer Care.
Ahead of the race, Coleman said: "It's going to be a tough undertaking for Sir Ranulph, he's taking on the extremes of the heat, desert storms and endless sand dunes, instead of the -50C, high altitudes, snow and ice that he's far more used to conquering.
"It's my job to get him to the finish line safely and in one piece."
