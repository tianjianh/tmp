Portsmouth 2-0 Blackpool

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Goals from Gareth Evans and Eoin Doyle secured Portsmouth their second win in four days as they beat Blackpool 2-0 in their League Two clash at Fratton Park.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Blackpool were unbeaten in four league games but it was the hosts who nearly took the lead on five minutes when Evans' shot hit the crossbar.
Just before the half-hour mark, after increased pressure from the hosts, Enda Stevens found Evans on his own in the area and the 28-year-old made no mistake, striking a powerful shot into the top left corner.
The hosts almost doubled their lead three minutes later but Gary Roberts' header trickled past the post.
After the break Portsmouth continued their domination but with nine minutes to go Blackpool made a triple substitution and forced their best chance of the game from a corner, Tom Aldred heading just wide.
Portsmouth sealed the points in injury time when substitute Carl Baker and Doyle combined to pass the ball around keeper Sam Slocombe.
