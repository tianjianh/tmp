The 25-year-old world number 14 will play multiple champion John Higgins in the quarter-finals after reaching the last eight for the season year running.
"I know how tough it will be against John," said Wilson. "He's won it four times and is a great player.
"I'm here to win it, not to make up the numbers. You have to be confident."
Wilson's 2016 Crucible run only came to an end at the hands of eventual winner Mark Selby, with the Leicester man then tipping Wilson to lift the trophy at some point in his career.
The Kettering cueman, whose break of 143 was the highest at the Crucible last season, added: "I am not really bothered about going one step further. I want to win the tournament.
"I am not being arrogant - I just feel I am a consistent top-16 player now and have a good chance.
"I am in the quarter-finals and I have to win three more matches to lift that trophy. That is what I have dreamed of since I was a young boy and that is what I will keep aiming for.
"I don't think anyone - maybe barring the odd qualifier - comes here thinking they couldn't win it and I am no different."
Wilson, the 2015 Shanghai Masters champion, enjoyed a routine first-round win over qualifier David Grace, following that victory by seeing off 2015 champion Stuart Bingham.
And Wilson intends to continue the attacking style which served him so well against Bingham.
Wilson led 5-0 but, despite Bingham's brave comeback, he continued take the match to his opponent as the pressure increased and finished a 13-10 winner.
"Not going for your shots would have sent out the wrong message," said Wilson. "It's important to carry on playing your game and do the things that have served you well.
"I feel like I have kept being consistent and getting to the business end of tournaments.
"This isn't an easy place to play so to be in my second quarter-final is testament to me as a player."
