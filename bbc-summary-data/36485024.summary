[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Accident investigators have said an engine fire which forced an aircraft to make an emergency landing was caused by an oil supply failure.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Flybe service from Glasgow to Belfast on 16 December 2014 made an emergency landing when its left engine caught fire.
Some of the 76 passengers sustained minor injuries escaping the plane.
The fire was extinguished by firefighters at Belfast International Airport.
A report by the Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) said a cracked washer on the aircraft's Pratt and Whitney Canada PW150A turboprop engine became loose, causing the oil pump to fail.
This resulted in the engine overheating and a fire starting.
The pilots on the Bombardier DHC-8-402 plane noticed a warning light and audio warning during the flight to Belfast City Airport.
After feeling a "judder through the airframe" they began to turn the aircraft back towards Scotland.
Passengers and cabin crew heard three "whooshing" noises and saw a large blue flame coming from the engine.
After a fire warning sounded again, the pilots diverted to the nearest airfield, Belfast International Airport.
The report said some passengers had to jump to the ground after the plane made an emergency landing because rear exits were not equipped with slides.
A number fell, receiving "minor cuts and bruises".
No-one was seriously injured.
