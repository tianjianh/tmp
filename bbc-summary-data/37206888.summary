No Scottish team can live with Celtic attack - Leigh Griffiths

Leigh Griffiths says no team in Scotland can cope with Celtic's attacking threat.

The champions moved to the top of the Scottish Premiership with a 4-1 victory over Aberdeen, last season's runners-up, at Celtic Park.
"No, I don't think they can," said the striker when asked if other teams could cope with Celtic's forward line.
"We go forward at pace and hurt teams. It's great to have those attacking options."
Griffiths set Celtic on their way to victory with a superb opening goal against the Dons.
Adam Rooney hauled the visitors level, but goals from James Forrest, Scott Sinclair and Tom Rogic ensured Brendan Rodgers's men moved a point clear at the top with a game in hand over second-top Rangers.
It was Griffiths' seventh goal of the season and Celtic's 10th in three Premiership matches on top of the five they got against Motherwell in the League Cup. The Scotland striker relishes playing in an attacking unit that is thriving domestically.
"When we break at pace with me, Moussa (Dembele), Scott (Sinclair), James (Forrest), Patrick (Roberts), Tom (Rogic) and Ryan (Christie), who was on the bench, it's formidable."
Griffiths saluted midfielder Rogic, who scored Celtic's fourth from a free-kick against the over-run Dons.
"We know what Tom can do," he said. "He just glides along the floor and his touch at times is phenomenal. His all-round game is different class.
"It must have been disappointing for him during the week (against Hapoel Beer-Sheva) to not start the game, but he came back and was man of the match."
The former Hibernian man revealed that he has been playing with a sore hamstring since before the home game with Hapoel and will be assessed by Scotland's medics in the coming days.
Gordon Strachan's side begin their World Cup qualifying campaign in Malta a week on Sunday.
"I've managed to battle through it," said Griffiths. "I'll go away with Scotland now and see the physios. I always want to play for my country. I don't want to let anybody down.
"Hopefully I can pull through and get a chance. I've managed to play 60 minutes against Aberdeen and 55 minutes during the week."
Griffiths is Scotland's form striker but has had limited starting opportunities under Strachan.
"It's not my decision to make, it's Gordon's decision," the striker added. "If he sees that I'm ready to go then I'll be delighted.
"I've said it before - I'll sit on the bench and wait my turn. If I get called up, I'll give 100%."
