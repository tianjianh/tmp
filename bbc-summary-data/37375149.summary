[SN]TITLE[SN]
Frank Cushnahan was consultant to seven different Nama debtors, report reveals

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Former Nama adviser Frank Cushnahan was a consultant to seven different Nama debtors, a new report has revealed.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Mr Cushnahan declared his interests at Nama meetings, as required.
Nama has said those meetings never involved the disclosure of debtor-specific information.
But the Comptroller and Auditor General said potential conflict of interests arose that "would not be managed sufficiently" just by withholding debtor-specific information.
Mr Cushnahan declared his interests at Nama advisory committee meetings and in annual declarations.
The Comptroller and Auditor General (C&AG) said Nama should have formally considered whether Mr Cushnahan's involvement in discussion of its Northern Ireland strategy was consistent with his involvement as a financial adviser to debtors.
Mr Cushnahan was appointed to the advisory committee in 2010, on the recommendation of the DUP,  and served until November 2013.
The committee's role was to advise on strategy for the Northern Ireland portfolio which had a value of more than Â£1bn.
The report said that Mr Cushnahan declared an involvement with Nama debtors whose loans represented at least half the value of the Northern Ireland portfolio.
He made eight declarations relating to five debtors over the course of meetings held between April 2011 and December 2012.
In addition his annual statements for 2011 to 2013 disclosed his interests in a further two Nama debtors.
He stated that his interests related to the provision of consultancy services and that this was on a non-remuneration basis in all but one case.
Speaking on Thursday, the Nama chairman Frank Daly said: "He had conflicts of interest...but it was managed.
"I don't want to conflate it with stuff that has emerged subsequently about him."
Nama has reported Mr Cushnahan to Republic of Ireland ethics watchdog the Standards in Public Office Commission (Sipo) over what it believes were undeclared conflicts of interest.
Nama has said it was not told about a May 2013 meeting Mr Cushnahan had with Pimco, an investor interested in buying the Northern Ireland portfolio.
Mr Cushnahan went on to work for Pimco and was in line to receive a Â£5m fee if the fund's bid for the portfolio had been successful.
Nama has also reported him to the police alleging possible corruption.
That followed a BBC NI Spotlight programme which broadcast a recording made in 2012 in which Mr Cushnahan accepted a Â£40,000 cash payment from a Nama debtor.
Mr Cushnahan has denied any wrongdoing.
