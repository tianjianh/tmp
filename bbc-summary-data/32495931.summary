Last year Labour's Glenda Jackson won by 42 votes, but this year she is not standing.
A key issue in the area is housing, as many of the borough's wealthier people could be hit by a mansion tax, while others are moving out as they cannot afford to live there.
BBC London's Alice Bhandhukravi talks to the candidates hoping to win the seat.
