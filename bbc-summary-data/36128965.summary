[SN]TITLE[SN]
York independent flooding inquiry to take more than six months

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An independent inquiry into flooding in York over Christmas will take more than six months to report back.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The inquiry is to look at how the city council and other agencies coped with the floods and how information was provided to residents.
It will be chaired by Angharad Davies, a self-employed barrister.
Hundreds of homes and businesses were flooded in the city after the Rivers Foss and Ouse burst their banks in December.
The other two members of the inquiry panel have been confirmed as:
They were appointed by the leaders of the Conservative, Liberal Democrat, Labour and Green groups on the city council.
"It's important that as a local council we do everything we can to answer residents' questions and ensure lessons can be learned for the future," they said.
"This review will help us to get a much clearer picture of what happened and what steps need to be taken to try to prevent flooding like this in the future."
The council said the chair will be able to consider whether to take oral evidence in public, written evidence, or use public meetings and workshops to achieve its aims.
A budget of Â£50,000 had been provided to cover all the cost involved with the inquiry.
The final report and any recommendations will be used by the council to form an action plan to be used during any future flooding event in the city.
