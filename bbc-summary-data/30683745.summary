Midfielder Moore, 21, has spent the last two years playing in America and is waiting for international clearance on his move to the New Lawn.
Former Bristol Rovers centre back Clough, 24, joins the Conference club for an undisclosed fee.
"It's been really busy," said Pennock of the transfer window.
He told BBC Radio Gloucestershire: "Dale Vince [chairman] has been superb so it's exciting times."
Forest Green are seventh in non-league's top flight, two points from the play-offs.
