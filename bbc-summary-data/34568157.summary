Football's world governing body has suspended its president Sepp Blatter and vice-president Michel Platini for 90 days amid corruption allegations.
Fifa's executive committee meets on Tuesday to discuss whether to postpone February's presidential election.
"I come without baggage and I have substantial experience from both football and in finance," Vega said.
The former Switzerland international, who also played for Celtic and Watford, has worked in finance since retiring from football in 2004.
Ex-Spurs team-mate David Ginola failed to secure the necessary backing to stand in May's Fifa presidential election, which was won by Blatter days before he announced he would stand down.
Vega told BBC Sport he will decide over the next three to five days if he is to stand.
Uefa president Platini and Prince Ali bin al-Hussein have already announced their candidacy, with Sheikh Salman Bin Ebrahim Al Khalifa of Bahrain also expected to do so before the 26 October deadline.
Former Trinidad and Tobago midfielder David Nakhid launched his campaign to be president on Sunday.
Nakhid said he had successfully secured the five nominations from national associations needed to become a candidate and had submitted his paperwork to Fifa's election committee.
Fifa's executives will discuss Platini's candidacy when they meet in Zurich on Tuesday in the wake of his suspension.
The governing body's ethics committee began its investigation after the Swiss attorney general opened criminal proceedings against Blatter in September.
He is accused of signing a contract "unfavourable" to Fifa and making a "disloyal payment" to Platini.
The ethics committee also opened an inquiry into Platini over the 2m euros (Â£1.35m) payment, which was made nine years after the former France footballer carried out consultation work for Blatter.
General secretary Jerome Valcke is also suspended. All three deny any wrongdoing.
Given Platini's legal position, it is believed there are a number of European associations keen to explore a 'plan b' candidate.
Uefa says it is continuing to support Platini but with his appeal against the suspension ongoing - and a potential visit to the Court of Arbitration for Sport to follow - there has been a a degree of confusion over the Frenchman's eligibility to take part in the election.
BBC Sport understands the executive committee meeting will discuss the issue and will hear from the head of Fifa's electoral committee, Domenico Scala.
Fifa are not planning to hold a news conference but an update on Platini's position is expected to be communicated in a post-meeting statement.
Meanwhile, Franz Beckenbauer, who led Germany's successful bid to host the 2006 World Cup, issued a statement denying allegations of a secret fund to secure votes to stage the event.
