Aberdeen manager Derek McInnes was thrilled with the desire of his side after two stoppage time goals earned a 3-1 win over Fola Esch in their Europa League qualifying first round tie.

Julien Klein cancelled out Shay Logan's second half opener before Niall McGinn and Adam Rooney scored during seven minutes of additional time.
McInnes insists that was deserved given the amount of chances his side created.
"We had two goals chopped off that shouldn't have been," he said.
"The ball's not over the line when (Jayden) Stockley keeps it in play and Ash Taylor scores in the first half.
"There's no push from Taylor (for his second disallowed attempt). We've had things cleared off the line, their keeper's had a brilliant night and we've dominated the game."
It had been a frustrating first half with Stefano Bensi hitting the post for the visitors early on.
Aberdeen started the second period on the front foot and eventually got the result their play merited, in what was an absorbing first outing of the season.
"When we generated that pace to the game and tempo in the second half we were far better," McInnes told BBC Scotland.
"We wore them down. I think they deserve some credit because they've got a decent structure about them and we never had the sharpness of play to keep that intensity up.
"That game will help us be in better form the next time round. That's a huge step in terms of being real game ready for the next one."
McInnes has recruited a number of players but it was the familiar faces of McGinn, Rooney and Jonny Hayes who showed their enduring value.
"We needed our ball carriers really being alive, really having that thrust and really getting at them," added the Dons boss.
"Niall and Jonny were both relentless, especially second half.
"Rooney, we're so lucky to have him. We missed him at the back end of last season. We've tried to nurse him through pre-season work.
"We thought if he only had half a game in him, we thought second half would be the best time to get him on.
"We could be standing talking about a 1-1 draw and the difficulties of the second leg.
"It's still going to be difficult but I'm going away thinking there's work to be done, far from perfect but the desire from the players was fantastic."
CS Fola Esch manager Jeff Strasser said he was "very proud" of his team for the effort they put in, but feels his team will struggle to turn around the two-goal defecit in the second leg.
"We all know the difference between 2-1 and 3-1," he said. "Aberdeen have shown they are a very good team, they will put a lot of pressure on us, but 2-1 would have been totally different."
