Baby chimpanzee goes on display at Edinburgh Zoo

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The first baby chimpanzee to be reared in captivity in Scotland in 15 years has gone on display at Edinburgh Zoo.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Eight weeks old Velu was born to mother Heleen on 24 June and lives in the Budongo Trail at the zoo with 18 other chimpanzees.
Heleen is from a group of nine chimpanzees who arrived at Edinburgh Zoo from the Netherlands in 2010.
The chimps started life in a research lab, then were rehomed to Beekse Bergen Safari Park, before Edinburgh.
Sophie Pearson, team leader for the Budongo Trail at Edinburgh Zoo, said: "We are delighted with the arrival and successful integration of Velu into our chimpanzee group.
"Still very young, Velu will look like a baby for another five years or so.
"He currently has a beautiful pale, pinky-coloured face which will darken as he gets older and has a mass of spiky hair.
"His father is either 38 year old Louis or 21 year old Rene, two of the males in our group. Later on we will do a paternity test to confirm."
