The 29-year-old English forward has scored over 120 goals in his senior career and joined Kerala from Leyton Orient earlier this year.
He has previously played for Tranmere Rovers, Rochdale, Scunthorpe, Barnsley, Bradford City and Coventry City.
"I'm very excited to be joining the club," Dagnall told the Hibs website.
"I know we are doing really well this season and after coming down to speak to the manager and coaching staff I'm really looking forward to joining in with the lads.
"Hibs are a big club, everyone knows about Hibs. I can see they've been doing well and they're competing at the top of the league with Rangers, Hibs is a team everyone keeps an eye out for.
"Hopefully the manager sees something in me that the other players haven't got here and that's why he is bringing me in.
"You'll get hard work out of me; I'll work my socks off in each and every game and hopefully get the goals that I want to get."
Hibs are level on points with Scottish Championship leaders Rangers and the two sides meet in Glasgow on Monday,
"Chris is a player with a great track record and he has played for a number of clubs, bringing with him a great deal of experience and guile to the team," added Easter Road head coach Alan Stubbs.
"He has played in England at a number of different clubs and played against some very good players, and I believe that his experience can only be beneficial to our squad, and his talent will be a good asset to have as we strive to achieve our goals this campaign."
