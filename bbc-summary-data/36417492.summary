Bale emerged unscathed from Real Madrid's Champions League win over Atletico and was today confirmed in Chris Coleman's final 23-man squad.
In a BBC Wales documentary, "Gareth Bale: Euro Star", the 26-year-old forward talks of the team spirit he believes gives Wales an edge in France.
"We all feel like brothers and will literally do anything for each other," Bale said.
Wales begin their campaign against Slovakia on 11 June, before facing England five days later and Russia on 20 June.
"We're not going there just to make up the numbers," Bale added.
"We want to win every game that we play, want to win the group and give ourselves the best chance.
"No matter who we play we feel confident in our abilities we can win and we'll go out there and try and do that."
Cardiff-born Bale came through Wales' youth teams alongside many of the current senior side including Aaron Ramsey and Chris Gunter.
They are members of the first Welsh side in 58-years to reach the finals of a major tournament.
And Bale believes their team spirit will count in Wales' favour.
"We've all been together for such a long time and get on really well," Bale added.
"We know each other's games and we all fight for each other on the pitch."
Bale has returned to Wales after Real Madrid beat rivals Atletico Madrid on penalties to secure their 11th European Cup title.
The former Tottenham and Southampton player scored his penalty despite struggling with cramp during extra time.
