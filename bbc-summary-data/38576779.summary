Ospreys defence coach Brad Davis believes the current squad have more than shed the image of 'Galacticos' once associated with the region.

Davies says that team ethos is at the heart of the current squad's fantastic run of form that has seen them win eight successive matches, one short of what would be a record for the region.
"I actually remember watching the Galacticos and they were a great team," he told BBC Wales Sport.
"I think we are just working together."
Davis says the culture of the Ospreys has led directly to their success, with no star players at the region.
"What impresses me about this team is the culture that Steve Tandy has put in place," he said.
"And no player is bigger than any other , no player is hogging the limelight "
Australian Davis, who is credited with rejuvenating the Ospreys' defence this season, says the changes have been technical.
"One thing that was never lacking was effort, so we looked at the structural side of things and hopefully I've given these guys a framework where they can make decisions out on the field and make us a difficult side to break down," he said.

Davis thinks all the problem will be ironed out in the ongoing debate about high tackles, following a change in the rules.
"In these early stages there's going to be loads in every game that we can look at," he said.
"But I think the referees will start to have a greater empathy and a greater feel and I think they'll find a balance between intent and accident."
