[SN]TITLE[SN]
Luton Town 2-1 Crawley Town

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Two goals from leading scorer Danny Hylton saw Luton come from behind to beat Crawley at Kenilworth Road.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The hosts moved up to fourth in the League Two table thanks to the second-half brace from Hylton, which takes his personal tally up to 17 for the season.
However, they were frustrated early on, with visiting goalkeeper Glenn Morris producing a stunning save from Pelly Ruddock's volley.
Jimmy Smith volleyed wide and Jordan Roberts saw his cross clip the top of the bar for the visitors as they responded.
Smith was only inches away for the visitors in first-half stoppage time, nodding wide of the far post.
But they led on the hour mark, as Smith was denied by Matt Macey, only to tee up James Collins who lashed the ball home.
Ollie Palmer's volley was tipped over by Morris, but it was 1-1 on 70 minutes, Hylton stabbing home his 16th of the season, before volleying into the bottom corner in the 76th minute following superb work by Ruddock.
