[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Liverpool has been named as the host city for the Netball World Cup in 2019.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The championship is held every four years and has only been in England on two previous occasions - Birmingham in 1995 and the first ever tournament in Eastbourne in 1963.
The 2019 event will be staged at the ACC Liverpool, although dates have yet to be confirmed.
Australia are the current holders and will defend their 2011 title on home soil in Sydney in August.
The home nation automatically qualifies as one of the 16 teams in the competition, along with the next five highest-ranked teams from the previous championship.
England claimed third place in 2011 in Singapore, with their best finish in the tournament coming in 1975 when they were runners-up to New Zealand.
