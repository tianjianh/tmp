A court in Turkey has sentenced two Syrians to four years in jail over the death of Alan Kurdi and four others.

Alan was the Syrian three-year-old whose photograph, lying dead on a Turkish beach, focused world attention on the refugee crisis in September.
Mufawaka Alabash and Asem Alfrhad were convicted of people smuggling, but acquitted of causing death "through deliberate negligence".
Thousands of refugees and migrants arrive daily in Greece from Turkey.

Why Alan Kurdi's picture cut through
Alabash and Alfrhad were tried in Bodrum, the same Turkish city where Alan's body was washed up.
The pair had faced up to 35 years in prison each. Both pleaded not guilty in February.
Alan's five-year-old brother Galib and his mother Rihan also drowned when the boat they were on sank during an attempted crossing to the Greek island of Kos.
The father, Abdullah, survived.  He now lives in Iraq.
In the latest efforts to tackle the migrant crisis, European Council President Donald Tusk is due to hold talks with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Friday.
Mr Tusk has raised the idea of "shipping back" migrants who arrive in the Greek islands from Turkey.
A note on terminology: The BBC uses the term migrant to refer to all people on the move who have yet to complete the legal process of claiming asylum. This group includes people fleeing war-torn countries such as Syria, who are likely to be granted refugee status, as well as people who are seeking jobs and better lives, who governments are likely to rule are economic migrants.
