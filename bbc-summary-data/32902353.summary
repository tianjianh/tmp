[SN]TITLE[SN]
Llangollen chain bridge reopens after 30 years

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A north Wales chain bridge which closed in the 1980s reopens on Thursday.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Llangollen chain bridge in Denbighshire was built in 1817 by coal merchant Exuperius Pickering for a cheap transport route across the River Dee.
Llangollen town and Llantysilio community councils were behind the restoration project after buying it for Â£1 when it fell into disrepair after years of neglect.
Chain bridge heritage officer Samantha Jones said it was "a labour of love".
