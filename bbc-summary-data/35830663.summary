Double bass player John Martin, 48, strangled her at their Newton Heath home in Manchester, on their second wedding anniversary.
Ms Strelchencko, 38, died of head and neck injuries last August, the trial at Manchester Crown Court was told.
Martin had denied murder and claimed he had no memory of the attack.
The court heard he beat Ms Strelchenko, who was also known by the surname Strelle, after he losing his temper at their home on 30 August.
The prosecution claimed Martin was jealous of Ms Strelchenko's successful career but giving evidence he told the jury that was "ridiculous".
The couple's relationship was "marked with tensions," prosecuting counsel Rob Hall said.
"He was very jealous if she was out without him... They would also argue regularly about such matters as financial affairs and who should keep the house clean," Mr Hall said.
Martin, who worked for the computer firm IBM in his home country of Norway before becoming a musician, met Ms Strelchenko in 2007.
She made her debut at the age of 12 with the St Petersburg Symphony Orchestra and performed piano recitals at New York's Carnegie Hall and London's Wigmore Hall.
She moved to Manchester in 2009 following the breakdown of her first marriage three years earlier.
The family of Ms Strelchenko said the musician had been "much loved" adding, "we will never forget Natalia or the many memories she has given us".
In a statement they said: "She was extremely talented with much life ahead of her.
"She was taken from us in August in completely unnecessary circumstances. We cannot express how devastated we are that her life has been stolen from her.
"We miss Natalia every minute of every day. We can try to repair our heartache although no matter how long the sentence is, it will not bring Natalia back or make our loss any easier."
Martin is expected to be sentenced next week.
