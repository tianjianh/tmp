Carlisle United 1-1 Stevenage

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Jabo Ibehre's third goal in as many games rescued a point for Carlisle in a draw with play-off rivals Stevenage.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Stevenage took the lead shortly after half-time through a Steven Schumacher penalty and soaked up plenty of pressure as they preserved their two-point advantage over the Cumbrians in League Two despite Ibehre's second-half equaliser.
Carlisle dominated the early exchanges and skipper Danny Grainger was not far away with a 25-yarder that whistled over the bar.
Despite having shown comparatively little as an attacking force up to the 50th minute, it was Stevenage who went in front from a penalty following a clumsy challenge on Kgosi Ntlhe, leaving Schumacher to smash the ball high into the net.
Stevenage should have gone further ahead in the 57th minute when Schumacher was left with just the goalkeeper to beat, but Mark Gillespie got down well to divert the shot for a corner.
Carlisle's pressure finally paid off in the 72nd minute when Jamie Proctor's floated diagonal ball to the far post was met by Ibehre who slid his shot past Jamie Jones from a tight angle.
