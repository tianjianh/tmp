[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Plans for 750 homes, a primary school and a park have been submitted to Swansea Council.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Persimmon Homes Ltd has applied for outline planning permission at a 50-hectare site at Bryngwyn Fields, near Gorseinon.
The school and park would be constructed during the second phase of the project, when a number of houses have been completed.
The developers said it would create a community "where people want to live".
Mike Hassett, who lives nearby, has objected to the plans, saying there is already severe congestion and road delays in the area, and road infrastructure was not being addressed in the scheme.
A main route off Hospital Road would serve the development. An access point at Swansea Road for the school would also be considered.
Mr Hassett said: "There is already a lack of local facilities in Garden Village.
"Where are the local doctors surgeries, chemists and dentist to support such a proposed increase?"
Swansea's emerging Local Development Plan has identified a need for more than 17,000 new homes by 2025.
Andy Baker-Edwards, from Persimmon Homes, said: "This proposal would help to meet that need in a sustainable location close to Gorseinon district centre.
"Central to these plans is a new primary school in Kingsbridge, which would be provided in the early phases of the development for the benefit of the community."
