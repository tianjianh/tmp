Yui Mok's picture of Madonna taking a tumble down stairs while performing on stage was one of the standout moments of the carefully choreographed 2015 Brit Awards at the O2 Arena, London.
Stefan Rousseau's picture of Lucy Howarth's reaction while Prime Minister David Cameron was helping with a reading lesson at the Sacred Heart Roman Catholic Primary School in Westhoughton, near Bolton, broke through the carefully arranged photocalls and stage-managed visits to become the defining image of the general election campaign.
Saleroom photocalls are a staple part of the diet of every press photographer, but Dominic Lipinski turned a routine assignment at Christie's London showroom ahead of an impressionist, modern, post-War and contemporary sale in New York into this beautifully crafted image.
Kensington Palace had worked hard with the media arrangement for the birth of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's second child - and there was no repetition of photographers waiting outside the Lindo Wing of St Mary's Hospital in London for days beforehand.  And while everyone wanted to see the new addition to the Royal Family, it was Prince George who melted many hearts as he arrived his father, Prince William, to see his new sister.  Picture by Anthony Devlin.
The general election campaign in Scotland was just as hard fought as it was south of the border.  Andrew Milligan photographed First Minister Nicola Sturgeon in a playhouse with a highly relevant front door as she visited the ABC Nursery in Dedridge, Livingston.
The Edinburgh Fringe Festival always delivers strong images.  Andrew Milligan produced this pictures of Morphsuited performers David Labanca and Gianmarco Pozzoli, from Italian dance company Discoteque Machine, performing in a giant kaleidoscope at Camera Obscura.
"Smile please." These two endangered 10cm (4in) baby undulate rays were photographed by Jonathan Brady at the Sea Life London Aquarium, where they are part of the attraction's breeding and tracking programme.
On the day the Queen became Britain's longest reigning monarch, she inaugurated the new Â£294m Scottish Borders Railway.  Andrew Milligan was the only photographer allowed on the train.
Jonathan Brady was inside St Paul's Cathedral for a Battle of Britain commemoration service, but when newly chosen leader of the Labour Party Jeremy Corbyn stood respectfully while others sang the national anthem, his otherwise unpromising position assumed a new importance and his picture had several front-page shows.
Newcastle-based Owen Humphreys has spent many nights looking for the Northern Lights and consulting solar weather forecasts, maps and charts showing the phases of the Moon. His picture combines a stunning display of the aurora borealis over Derwentwater, near Keswick, in the Lake District, with an interesting foreground.
Wherever he travels, Mayor of London Boris Johnson makes pictures. PA photographer Stefan Rousseau was with him when he joined a street rugby tournament in Tokyo.  As competitive on the playing field as on the political hustings, he knocked over 10-year-old Toki Sekiguchi, who was unharmed in the collision.
Andrew Milligan was in Ghent to see Great Britain's Andy Murray mobbed by his team-mates after beating David Goffin during day three of the Davis Cup final to bring the trophy back to the UK for the first time in 79 years.
Owen Humphreys was one of the first on the scene in the Cumbrian flooding, and stayed with the story for several days. This picture of a man riding his bike down through floodwater in Eldridge Street, Carlisle, was rather different from the all-too-familiar pictures of rescue workers in rubber boats and householders drying out their waterlogged possessions.
