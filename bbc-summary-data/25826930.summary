The movie, which was nominated for five Oscars last Thursday including best picture, took £4.6m over the weekend.
It pushed last week's number one, 12 Years a Slave, another leading Academy Award contender, into second place.
Seventies heist caper American Hustle, animation Frozen and Devil's Due completed the top five.
Former box office leader American Hustle, which took £1.5m in its fifth week of release, bagged 10 Oscar nods including all four acting shortlists.

1. The Wolf of Wall Street - £4.6m

The lower end of this week's box office chart was taken up by The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug at six, Last Vegas at seven and The Railway Man - starring Colin Firth and Nicole Kidman - in eighth spot.
Delivery Man and space disaster movie Gravity - which also has 10 Oscar nominations - rounded out the top 10.
Gravity, starring best actress nominee Sandra Bullock alongside George Clooney, took just under £500,000 in its 11th week at cinemas.
But the Hobbit has amassed the biggest cumulative box office returns of this week's top 10, with a total haul of £41.5m.
It is followed by Frozen, on £34.1m after seven weeks, and Gravity with £28.8m.
