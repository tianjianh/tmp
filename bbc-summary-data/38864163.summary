[SN]TITLE[SN]
Derby County 3-3 Bristol City

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Darren Bent's second-half double earned Derby County an unlikely point as they came back from 3-0 down in an astonishing game against Bristol City.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Matty Taylor netted on his full debut and Tammy Abraham scored twice from close range as the Robins dominated an abject home side in the first half.
Headers from Bent and Tom Ince, though, set up a thrilling finale.
And Bent's penalty, after Scott Golbourne fouled Ince, denied City a third away league win of the season.
Bent's composure from the spot - for his sixth goal in seven games - took the Rams to within five points of the play-off places, and came after a second-half performance which was in stark contrast to a miserable opening period when the Rams lacked both urgency and quality.
Taylor's tap-in, in his second match after a controversial move from Bristol Rovers, put the visitors ahead.
They wasted several chances to double the lead before Abraham's double - the first set up after a flowing team move and both involving the excellent Taylor - seemingly settled the match by the break.
A second successive City win, which would have taken them five points clear of the relegation zone, started to look in doubt as the Rams hit back through Bent's diving header and Ince's downward header.
And Bent's coolly taken penalty made it 3-3 with 10 minutes left, but the Robins survived some strong home pressure to go home with one point.
Derby boss Steve McClaren: "For the neutral it was one hell of a game, but we talk about game ready or game head on and we didn't have it on first half, it's as simple as that.
"You can't do that against any opponent. We had to change attitude and it was up to the players to respond, which they did, but I think it's a lesson for us.
"We said that at the end, it's a lesson and if you're not right and your game head isn't on, you can lose to anyone.
"It was Jekyll and Hyde, we know the direction we want to take and it's up to the players."
Bristol City head coach Lee Johnson: "You know when your kid runs out in the road and you quickly grab them back in and you don't know whether to give them a smack on the bum or a cuddle, that's how I feel.
"So much of our work was excellent today, the way the players passed and moved the ball in the first half, and even in the second we created numerous really good chances and could have scored six.
"But obviously I'm massively disappointed, I'd be lying if I told you I was happy with the group and taking a point from a winning position and three goals up.
"We are very, very close to being a decent side but we've got to learn and grow together."
