[SN]TITLE[SN]
Alloa Athletic 1-1 Raith Rovers

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Alloa's winless run stretched to nine matches after Kyle Benedictus' injury-time equaliser earned Raith a draw at Recreation Park.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Raith peppered Scott Gallacher's goal but Ryan Hardie and Lewis Toshney were among those denied.
Steven Hetherington made the visitors pay by drilling one past Gallacher into the bottom left corner.
But Benedictus levelled at the death to leave Alloa waiting for their first win since January 12.
