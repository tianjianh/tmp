The accident happened at around 04:50 BST on the eastbound carriageway, near the JCB factory.
West Midlands Ambulance Service said nothing could be done to save the driver, who was confirmed dead at the scene.
The service said the eastbound carriageway had been closed.
"On arrival, crews found one lorry on its side facing the opposite direction to the carriageway with significant damage to the central reservation," an ambulance service spokesman said.
"Sadly, it immediately became apparent there was nothing that could be done to save the driver.
"The driver of the other HGV was uninjured but was understandably badly shaken and was checked over by ambulance staff.  He was discharged at scene."
He said the eastbound carriageway of the A50 would be closed for several hours.
