Sixteen sports, 30 Olympic sessions, one dream honeymoon.

Kirsty and Matt Hardman may just be the Team GB super fans of the 2016 Olympic Games, after taking venue-hopping, event-watching and selfie-gathering to podium level.
The couple, from Fakenham in Norfolk, started planning an Olympic honeymoon when they got engaged in 2014.
While chasing Team GB around Rio, they have met medallists such as Andy Murray and Jessica Ennis-Hill - and they aren't done yet, as the hunt for tickets goes on for the two PE teachers.
"To sum up the experience, it has literally been the trip of a lifetime and the best possible honeymoon we could have ever wished for," said Kirsty, who married Matt a year ago after over four years together.
The couple have been to the opening ceremony, football, rowing, beach volleyball, basketball, tennis, gymnastics, track cycling, swimming, show jumping, BMX, canoe slalom, athletics, volleyball, diving, boxing, and rugby sevens.
"Being in the venue for all of these events was such incredible experiences and it felt great to be part of seeing history in the making," added Kirsty.
"We've met lots of GB athletes at the events and on the park and they have been very generous with their time, so grateful of the support and to see GB fans out here."
While some couples ask for white goods or crockery as wedding gifts, the Hardmans wanted to see Mo Farah win 10,000m gold and so instead sought help from loved ones in the shape of tickets, flights and accommodation.
So, was it worth it?
"Tokyo 2020, here we come," added Kirsty.
