The 32-year-old Australian joined the club from Canterbury Bulldogs in August 2013 and scored seven tries in 51 Vikings appearances.
He made his debut in the Australian NRL with Penrith in 2002 and also played for Wests Tigers and Canberra Raiders.
"This decision is definitely one of the hardest things I've ever had to do," he told the Widnes website.
"I think it's the right time to start the next chapter of my life. The last thing I wanted was to let myself, my family and my team-mates down on the field by not consistently competing at a high level.
"I will always have a soft spot for the Widnes Vikings. I couldn't have asked for a better place to end my career."
Head coach Denis Betts said: "I'd like to thank Danny for his contribution to our team's development over the last two years, he's been a fantastic professional and a pleasure to coach."
