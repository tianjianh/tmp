Jan Byrne, 43, from Liskeard, said the birds swooped on tortoise Stig who died two days later from his injuries.
"They turned him over and were pecking at him. We were devastated," said Mrs Byrne.
It follows reports of two dogs being killed by seagulls in the past three months in the region.
Seagulls were reported to have attacked and killed Yorkshire terrier Roo in Newquay, Cornwall, last week and in May a Chihuahua puppy was killed in Honiton, Devon, a local newspaper reported.
Insurance agent Mrs Byrne said the attack on the tortoise happened in the back garden of her house.

She said she chased the two seagulls off after the attack, which happened three weeks ago.
Despite attempts to treat his wounds, Stig died two days later, she said.
"It was like a bloody scene from a horror movie, I found Stig upside down with blood pouring from his wounds.
"The vet said he had died of an infection.
"We had Stig for 15 years and he was more than 20 years old. My daughter was distraught."
Stig's brother George avoided the attack and a pet rabbit, Petal, was protected by being in her run, said Mrs Byrne.
"There are seagulls around here all the time, I assume they are attracted by rubbish.
"But now I'm also concerned about more attacks so I can't let George out to roam any more."
Liskeard Town Council has issued advice to residents about protecting their rubbish sacks from seagulls.
It includes tips such as covering bins in old carpet to prevent seagulls.
"The availability of food appears key to attracting seagulls," said an authority spokeswoman.
"They are pretty ruthless and when they have offspring they just act on instinct to protect their young."
