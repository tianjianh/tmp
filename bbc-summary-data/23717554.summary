[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An alleged Greenpeace protester accused of climbing London's Shard has been charged with aggravated trespass.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Alison Garrigan, 27, of Greater Manchester is due before Camberwell Magistrates' Court on 29 August.
Five other women who took part in the 16-hour ascent of the 1,016ft high (310m) building, admitted aggravated trespass and were cautioned.
The group scaled the 87-storey building in July in protest against Arctic oil drilling.
They evaded security guards to begin their climb in the early morning, saying the protest was intended to put Shell and other oil companies in the spotlight and they live-streamed the stunt using head cameras.
At the skyscraper's summit two of them unfurled a blue flag with Save the Arctic written on it.
In a statement Shell said oil and gas production in the Arctic "was not new".
The Shard, a Qatari-owned building, which was opened in February, contains offices, restaurants, a hotel and residential apartments.
