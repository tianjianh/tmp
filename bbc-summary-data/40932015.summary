[SN]TITLE[SN]
Accrington Stanley 1-3 West Bromwich Albion

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
West Brom's £12m summer signing Jay Rodriguez scored his first goal for the club as the Premier League side saw off League Two Accrington in the EFL Cup.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Tony Pulis made just four changes, with Salomon Rondon heading home the opener from Rodriguez's whipped cross.
The Baggies doubled their lead before the break when Matt Phillips took down a ball over the top and rifled in.
Rodriguez cut inside to drill a third into the bottom corner, while Tom Dallison slotted in a late consolation.
Kayden Jackson had a penalty appeal turned down for the hosts immediately before Rodriguez's strike, while substitute Mekhi McLeod twice went close for Stanley, forcing Boaz Myhill to tip wide of the post.
Rondon and Rodriguez, who signed from Southampton last month, were wasteful in front of goal as the Baggies could have won by a wider margin.
West Brom, captained by recent signing Gareth Barry, have won all three of their games this season, while defeat for John Coleman's side ended their perfect home record this term.
