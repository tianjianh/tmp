Rural Wales waiting to be unleashed, says CLA president

Poor internet speeds and phone reception are "stifling" Wales's rural economy, according to a lobby group.

The Country Landowners and Business Association (CLA) also argued more emphasis should be placed by planning authorities on the economic benefits of converting rural buildings.
President Ross Murray said rural Wales was the Cinderella of the economy, "just waiting to be unleashed".
A study into helping rural communities in Wales was published in October.
Mr Murray told BBC Wales's Country Focus programme he had to work hard to make a success of the business centre he and his wife, Elizabeth, set up at their Llanover estate near Abergavenny.
He added his experiences with the planning process had given him a "particular focus" on rural Wales.
The centre is now home to around 20 different businesses, but some left in the early days because of a lack of connectivity, requiring an investment of around Â£20,000 to create a broadband network.
Former soldier Mr Murray, who retrained as a charted surveyor, said: "We have some traditional buildings which can no longer really serve modern agriculture - yet they are there serving a very limited purpose.
"What I'm an advocate of is showing what the alternative might be.
"All we need is that framework of investment, positive planning policy and connectivity and we can do wonderful things in Wales."
Mr Murray claimed building sustainable businesses in rural communities could stop young people "fleeing for the towns and cities".
"I would encourage the Welsh government to introduce a statutory duty for any [planning] decision to take into account the social and economic context of the community," he said.
"I think if that change to the legislation was brought in, it would open people's eyes to the possibilities."
A Welsh government spokesman said while telecommunications policy was a matter for the UK government, it was working with them, the mobile industry and Ofcom to secure improvements in mobile coverage across Wales.
"The UK government confirmed last year that Wales would benefit from the early phase roll-out of their Mobile Infrastructure Project. We expect the UK government to deliver on their commitment," he said.
