Uganda profile

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Uganda is a pioneer in the liberalisation of the media in Africa. Private radio and TV mushroomed after the government loosened controls in 1993. Radio is the most popular medium. Public UBC covers the country in English and vernacular languages.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The central region around Kampala is home to dozens of private radio and TV stations. Rural radios serve ethnic groups and there is a cluster of religious stations. A digital TV switchover is planned.
BBC World Service is widely available on FM (101.3 in Kampala), and Radio France Internationale broadcasts on FM in the capital.
Although the print media are led by the state-owned New Vision newspaper, it enjoys considerable independence and often publishes articles which criticise the government.
US-based Freedom House classifies Uganda's media as "partly free". In 2012, it reported biased election coverage by state-run media in 2011 and attacks on journalists reporting on protests.
There were 4.2 million internet users by December 2011 (Internetworldstats).
