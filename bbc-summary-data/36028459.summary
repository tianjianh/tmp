[SN]TITLE[SN]
Search for family of Cardiff girl who won book in 1904

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man is trying to track down the family of a girl who won a book as a Sunday School prize in 1904.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Edie's Disobedience by Winifred Fenn was found in a house clearance in Kent.
Inside, there is a note saying it was a prize from St Dyfrig's Sunday School, Cardiff, which was awarded to Nina Davis of class VI at Christmas 1904.
Alan Smith, who found the book, said: "I would love to know the book has gone back to its rightful owner."
The note said Nina's teacher was Miss Frances and the vicar was the Revd Hector A Coe.
Mr Smith said: "It is in fabulous condition for a book which is now 112 years old. The note in the cover gives it a real history and I would be more than happy to pass it onto Nina's relatives free of charge."
St Dyfrig's Church was built in two stages between 1888 and 1904. It stood on the corner of Wood Street before being closed in the 1960s and demolished in 1969.
Anyone with information about the book can contact Mr Smith through Alison Young by emailing alisonyoung@churchinwales.org.uk
