World Indoors 2016: Concern over Lynsey Sharp's GB place

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Scottish 800m record holder Lynsey Sharp faces an anxious wait to see if she will be selected for next month's World Indoor Championships.

Sharp tops the British rankings and was expected to win the national trials at the weekend.
But she faded in the closing stages in Sheffield and was overtaken by English athletes Adelle Tracey and Leah Barrow.
The Great Britain team for the world championships in Portland, from 17-20 March, will be announced on Tuesday.
However, Sharp would appear to be in pole position to get the second discretionary spot for the 800m.
Guy Learmonth looks likely to miss out as he lost his men's title after being run down in the last few strides to finish third behind Jamie Webb and Spencer Thomas.
Compatriot Chris O'Hare skipped the trials but will hope to be chosen for the 1,500m.
Steph Twell and Jo Moultrie both achieved qualifying times for Portland as they completed a Scottish one-two in the 3,000m.
