Votes for assembly elections could be cast online if Plaid Cymru wins power, the party's leader has said.

Leanne Wood suggested a trial run of digital voting as part of a "democratic renewal", in a speech in Aberystwyth.
It follows the example of Estonia, where voting over the internet was introduced for elections in 2005.
Ms Wood has also pledged to lower the voting age for assembly elections to 16 under new powers promised to Wales.
Speaking at an event organised by the Electoral Reform Society, she added that Plaid Cymru would hold cabinet meetings outside Cardiff where the public could ask ministers questions.
Ms Wood said such openness would serve as a break with the "bunker mentality" of Labour.
"We will be accessible. We will be answerable. We will do our best to make Wales the best it can be," she said.
"We will doubtless get things wrong along the way. But we will not shy away from scrutiny or accountability."
Ms Wood also pledged to set up a National Youth Parliament, and promised that petitions attracting 10,000 signatures would be debated in the Senedd chamber.
