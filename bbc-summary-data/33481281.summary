US authorities are investigating after a United Airlines pilot flushed bullets down a toilet on a flight to Germany.

The pilot initially threw the bullets in a rubbish bin before disposing of them in the toilet, a spokeswoman for United Airlines said.
In the US, pilots are permitted to carry loaded weapons aboard planes under security measures put in place after the 9/11 attacks.
However, those rules do not apply in Germany, which has strict gun laws.
Karen May, the United Airlines spokeswoman, said the pilot - who has not been indentified - did not bring his gun on the 23 June flight from Houston to Munich, but he had left ammunition in his bag.
"He did incorrectly dispose of the ammunition," Ms May said, "but it is likely that the pilot is not going to face any criminal charges."
A flight attendant looking for a passenger's missing ring found the bullets in the rubbish bin. The pilot then disposed of the bullets in a toilet, but apparently alerted Germany authorities before landing after realising the flight attendant would report the incident.
Ms May would not say whether the pilot had been disciplined.
A spokesman for the Transportation Security Administration said the agency was investigating but would not comment further.
