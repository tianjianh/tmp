[SN]TITLE[SN]
Crawley Town 1-3 Port Vale

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Michael Brown started his first full season as Port Vale manager with a comfortable victory at Crawley to give opposite number Harry Kewell a disappointing Football League managerial debut.

Vale made the perfect start when veteran midfielder Michael Tonge fired them ahead after only nine minutes with a deflected free kick from 25 yards.
Tonge, who signed a one-year deal after a successful pre-season, turned provider on 26 minutes by curling in a free kick for skipper Antony Kay to head in at the near post.
Crawley's Dutch striker Enzio Boldewijn threatened shortly after by bursting into the area, but his goal-bound shot was blocked by keeper Robert Lainton.
Vale could have been further ahead by the interval but winger Cristian Montano headed a Marcus Harness cross over.
The hosts reduced the deficit eight minutes after the break through Boldewijn, who latched onto a pass from Mark Randall to run through and score with a fine solo effort.
Boldewijn was inches away from levelling on 67 minutes when he put a Dannie Bulman pass just wide.
Crawley were much improved in the second half and substitute Dean Cox had a low shot saved after Boldewijn had earlier put the ball wide.
But Vale substitute Daniel Turner made the game safe eight minutes from time by heading his first goal for the club from a cross by Harness.
