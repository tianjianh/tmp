PC Allan Smith, from Bovington in Dorset, admitted charges of harassment and disclosing police information when he appeared in court last month.
The 54-year-old has already been sacked from Dorset Police for gross misconduct following a force disciplinary hearing.
Dorchester Crown Court heard he had been receiving psychiatric treatment.
Smith, who also admitted a charge of using the police national computer for personal reasons, was suspended from duty after being charged in September.
He has been issued with an indefinite restraining order preventing him from contacting his victim.
The court heard he bombarded her with threatening text messages and phone calls between January 2013 and September 2014.
Supt Peter Windle, of Dorset Police's professional standards department, said: "Our thoughts and sympathies are with the victim in this case.
"We would like to thank her for her bravery in coming forward and reporting these offences and supporting the prosecution.
"Allan Smith was working in a position of trust as a frontline officer. He betrayed that trust and let down his colleagues and the police service.
"His arrest and prosecution reinforces the fact that Dorset Police expects the highest standards of professionalism and integrity from its staff."
