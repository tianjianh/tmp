The 37-year-old was attacked in Guildhall Square, Southampton at about 21:00 BST on Friday.
Police said they wanted to trace Billy and Geoffrey Midmore, 22 and 26, both from London.
Acting Det Insp Will Whale said the pair had contacts in Southampton, Basingstoke, London and were considered "dangerous individuals".
"I would appeal to Billy and Geoffrey to give themselves up now.  We will carry on with our manhunt until we find you, so make it easier on yourselves and come forward," he added
The woman remains in hospital being treated for burns to her face, neck and arms.
Earlier police said they were investigating if she had previously reported she was worried for her safety.
A Hampshire police spokesman said: "We have instigated a review in relation to any previous reports made by the victim to the police."
The woman, who is believed to be from the city, was the victim of a targeted attack by a group of men, police said.
The force has reassured local residents and visitors to the city it was a rare and "isolated incident".
