Southampton defender Jose Fonte has signed a new three-year contract with the Premier League club.

Club captain Fonte, 31, joined Saints from Crystal Palace in January 2010 when the club were in League One.
The Portugal international has made almost 250 appearances for them since and his new deal will take him through until the summer of 2018.
"This is where I feel happy and where I've been very successful, so this is where I want to be," he said.
"The contract was something that we had in our minds for a long time," Fonte added. "I'm delighted that we've signed it."
Fonte has only missed one league game under Ronald Koeman since the Dutchman joined the club last summer.
The manager praised the centre-back for his contribution to the team and the club.
"It's a statement about respect for the player and for how important he is for the team," Koeman said.
"His discipline and his performances are very good. You'd like to have captains like that and we have it."
