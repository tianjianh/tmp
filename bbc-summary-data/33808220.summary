A fire that sent plumes of smoke into the sky that could be seen across the city centre has badly damaged Birmingham Wholesale Market.

The market covers a 21-acre site with 235 stalls selling fish and meat as well as warehousing. It is thought about 20% of the building is affected.
At its peak, some 40 firefighters tackled the "severe" blaze on Pershore Street in Digbeth.
The fire is now out and investigators are looking at the cause.
Crews will remain at the scene for some time, the fire service said.
Several nearby roads have now reopened.
Crowds of people gathered near the scene at the fire's peak, and witness Toby Ashcroft said they were told by police to move back because of concerns about gas canisters in the building.
One person was treated for the effects of "minor smoke inhalation" and discharged at the scene.
The fire service, which was called out soon after 14:00 BST, described the blaze as "severe".
The market is set to be relocated to a purpose-built facility in Witton after the authority said it could not afford the investment needed to maintain the site.
