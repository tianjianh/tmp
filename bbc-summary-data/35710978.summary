Security at Euro 2016 will be "very stringent" when Wales fans head to France in June, the head of the Football Association of Wales has said.

With 100 days until the tournament starts, chief executive Jonathan Ford said safety is of the "utmost importance".
Thousands of fans are set to make trips to watch Wales play in their first major tournament since 1958.
They face Slovakia in Bordeaux, England in Lens and Russia in Toulouse.
If they qualify from Group B, they will reach the knock-out stages.
Security is expected to be stepped up following the Paris attacks last November, which included three explosions outside the Stade de France.
"One thing it does do is it ensures the appropriate plans will be put in place," Mr Ford told BBC Wales.
"I'm sure the security of the players, the staff and of course all of the fans is of the utmost importance.
"They'll be making sure people get to the stadiums early, they'll be making sure they've got pre-ticket checks so that anybody who's going to get near a stadium or near a fan zone is going to be appropriate, secure and going to enjoy the festival atmosphere."
