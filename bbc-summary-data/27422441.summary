Glover and Swann won three World Cup events together last season as well as the world title in South Korea.
And with a good performance in Amsterdam, Glover says there could be some tough decisions for the Great Britain selectors as to who partners her in the coxless pair for the rest of this season.

"There's lots of selection things about who will be in the pair out of those two.
"But I want to keep my eye on the World Championships at the end of August in Amsterdam.
"It'd be great to try and hold on to our world champion title, whoever else is in the boat with me."
