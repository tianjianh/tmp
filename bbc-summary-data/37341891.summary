The five-year-old has neuroblastoma and his family are trying to raise £700,000 for treatment in the United States.
Bradley led the teams out before Everton's 3-0 Premier League win on Monday and received a minute's applause from fans in the fifth minute.
Everton have also invited the Lowerys to the return fixture and will auction off signed shirts from the game.
