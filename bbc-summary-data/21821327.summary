The Next Day is the 66-year-old's first number one since 1993's Black Tie White Noise.
The album sold 94,000 copies this week, according to the Official Chart Company, outselling the number two album from Bon Jovi two to one.
Justin Timberlake remains at the top of the singles chart with Mirrors.
The announcement that Bowie was releasing new material came as a surprise to many in the music world, and has had Bowie aficionados picking over the fiercely private star's back catalogue, comparing his early work with his latest release.
A retrospective of the eclectic performer is being unveiled at London's V&A Museum on 23 March, celebrating Bowie as a musical innovator and cultural icon.
Although Bowie is not directly involved with curating the exhibition, the David Bowie Archive gave "unprecedented access" to the V&A, which picked out flamboyant costumes, early photographs and other memorabilia to show.
