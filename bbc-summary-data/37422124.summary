Alex Tait's second-half try helped Newcastle overcome Gloucester for their first Premiership win at Kingsholm since 2012.

Scores were level at 10-10 at half-time, Billy Burns landing two kicks and Ross Moriarty going over for Gloucester as Dom Waldouck grabbed Falcons' try and Michael Delaney kicked the points.
Tait's try and a second Delany penalty edged Newcastle ahead after the break.
In response, Greig Laidlaw kicked Gloucester's only second-half points.
With their first chance to take the lead, a turnover from Gloucester scrum-half Willi Heinz was punished as the ball quickly moved left into the hands of Juan Pablo Socino, who put Waldouck over.
The lead was short lived, as Moriarty grabbed a quick response and Burns added the extras to put hosts ahead for the first time.
Persistent pressure led only to a further Burns penalty, with a fine Tait tackle on Jacob Rowan and a knock-on as Gloucester broke quickly up field frustrating the hosts.
Delany then levelled scores at 10-10 with a penalty before the break.
Again after the interval, Newcastle held strong defensively before Delany landed a penalty from 40m to edge Falcons ahead.
And Belisano Agulla came off the bench to send Tait over to seal Falcons second win of the season and first Premiership win away from home in almost two years.
Gloucester director of rugby David Humphreys: "Today, we dominated territory and possession but then we dropped the ball and kicked the ball away. I'm bitterly disappointed.
"In this competition, these opportunities have to be taken and credit to Newcastle, they took their opportunities.
"At key moments in the game, we lost line-outs when we could have put Newcastle under pressure.  They defended and absorbed brilliantly."
Newcastle Falcons director of rugby Dean Richards: "I am pleased. We have come so close to winning away from home in the last year and have not quite achieved it.
"The mistakes we were making last year, we weren't making quite as many today.
"We are quite combative and will tackle our hearts out. If we take our chances, as we did today, we should be competitive with most people."
