[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A protest is under way at Stormont where a controversial oil well is to be debated by politicians.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A group of activists opposed to the exploratory well, near Carrickfergus, are outside Parliament Buildings.
They claim the drill, close to reservoirs, poses a risk to the water supply to thousands of homes in Belfast, Carrick and Newtownabbey.
However, Northern Ireland Water insists there is no threat to the integrity of the water supply.
The motion, to be debated on Monday evening, has been brought forward by Sinn FÃ©in.
It calls on the Stormont  Executive to ensure that similar applications are not approved until assurances are given about any potential negative impacts.
The exploratory well was given the go-ahead under what is called permitted development rights which meant it did not need planning permission.
If the company wants to commercially exploit the 25 million barrels of oil it believes is there, it would have to apply for full planning permission.
The drill began in mid May and is expected to last until the end of June.
The company, Infrastrata, will then assess the results before deciding what it wants to do next.
