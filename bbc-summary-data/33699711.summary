The Young Pope will feature the Annie Hall actress as an American nun living in the Vatican City, alongside Law's fictional Pope Pius XIII.
Due to be shown in 2016, the series focuses on the controversial beginning to the Pope's tenure.
He is described as a "conflicted character" who struggles to balance religious conservatism with compassion.
Producers have not yet released details of Keaton's character, but Pius XIII is said to be "stubbornly resistant to the Vatican courtiers", among whom she resides.
Keaton shot to fame in The Godfather, playing the girlfriend of Al Pacino's mafia boss, and her career includes hits such as The First Wives Club, Red, Marvin's Room and Father of the Bride.
The Young Pope is her first regular role on a TV show, and her first job on the small screen since 2006 TV movie Surrender, Dorothy.
The eight-part series will be directed by Italian filmmaker Paolo Sorrentino, who described it as a story of "faith" and how people "handle and manipulate power".
He added it would deal with "the clear signs of God's existence" and "the clear signs of God's absence", and how they affect the new leader of the Catholic Church.
Law's character will depict: "The inner struggle between the huge responsibility of the head of the Catholic Church and the miseries of the simple man that fate, or the Holy Spirit, chose as pontiff," he added.
A co-production by Sky, HBO and Canal +, The Young Pope is due on screen in 2016.
