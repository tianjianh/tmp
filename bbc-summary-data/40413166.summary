Durham v Worcestershire: Wood takes five wickets but Pears lead after D'Oliveira ton

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
England paceman Mark Wood completed his first five-wicket haul in almost three years to help limit Durham's damage as Worcestershire took control on a rain-affected day two at Chester-le-Street.

After his three wickets on Monday evening, Wood finished with 5-54 as he proved his fitness for the forthcoming Test series against South Africa.
Brett D'Oliveira completed his century (122) in the visitors' total of 367.
Wood's England team-mate Moeen Ali made 58 to earn Worcestershire a 170 lead.
In gloomy conditions in County Durham on the second day of an experiment with pink-ball day-night Championship matches, the floodlights were on right from the scheduled 14:00 BST start.
And only 43.4 overs were possible, as Worcestershire were bowled after a key stand of 73 between Ross Whiteley (43) and Ben Cox (32 not out), before the umpires called off play at 19:30 BST.
Prior to heading off on England one-day duty, Wood took only three wickets in two matches for Durham at a cost of 206 runs at the start of the season as he felt his way back from ankle surgery.
But, backed by Ryan Pringle's 4-73, he finished off the Worcestershire innings by knocking over Ed Barnard's off stump with his seventh delivery with the new ball, before forcing last man Josh Tongue to fend a catch to short leg.
Durham and England fast bowler Mark Wood told BBC Radio Newcastle:
"The pink ball held together well but it seemed to go soft quickly, so I think the jury is still out. Moeen Ali said he struggled to time it because it wasn't coming off the pitch.
"Getting wickets is a big confidence boost for me. My rhythm wasn't there in early season, but I'm fine now.
"Ben Stokes has been really unlucky over the last two days. A lot of the runs off him have gone to third man."
Worcestershire skipper Joe Leach told BBC Hereford & Worcester:
"It was an outstanding innings by Brett D'Oliveira and all credit to the other batsmen for getting us in a strong position.
"We had the perfect situation with a lead of 170 and a new pink ball to bowl with under the lights, so it's a pity we didn't get back out there."
