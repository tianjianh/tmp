Manx organisation Beach Buddies tackled the problem at Fleshwick Bay following concerns from the public.
Coordinator Bill Dale said one of the coves near the beach was found to be "jammed with plastic".
He added: "Amongst the find were a number of plastic bands which became infamous when a basking shark was photographed with one around its nose."
About 30 people joined forces with the Beach Buddies volunteers on Saturday morning.
"The area was in serious need of a clear-up," said Mr Dale.
"It was the first trip to Fleshwick for a team of our volunteers this year and it was a really big job".
