[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The former girlfriend of gunman Raoul Moat has told a court of the moment the killer shot dead her new boyfriend then turned his shotgun on her.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Moat, 37, shot Samantha Stobbart, 22, through the window of a friend's home in Gateshead after killing her 29-year-old boyfriend Chris Brown.
Miss Stobbart wept as Newcastle Crown Court heard how Moat "just appeared" and started shooting on 3 July.
She was giving evidence at the trial of two men accused of aiding Moat.
Karl Ness, 26, of of Brookside in Dudley, North Tyneside, denies the murder of Mr Brown, attempting to murder Pc Rathband, one charge of conspiracy to murder, one charge of possession of a firearm with intent to endanger life, and one of robbing a shop.
Qhuram Awan, 23, of Rowley Street in Blyth, Northumberland, denies the attempted murder of Pc Rathband, one charge of conspiracy to murder, one charge of possession of a firearm with intent to endanger life, and one of robbing a shop.
The court has heard that karate instructor Mr Brown had started a relationship with Ms Stobbart while the former bouncer was in prison. He was shot three times by Moat.
It was told Moat had become obsessed that Ms Stobbart was seeing another man after ending their six-year relationship.
Moat went on the run after killing Mr Brown, shooting Ms Stobbart and blinding Pc David Rathband by shooting him in the face.
He died after a six-hour stand-off in Rothbury, Northumberland, in July.
Sometimes whispering, Miss Stobbart described how Moat had a "Jekyll and Hyde split personality" and could be violent and unpredictable.
Moat wrongly believed Mr Brown was a police officer after Miss Stobbart told Moat he was to try to scare him off.
She described walking to the edge of a grassed area between the houses when Moat began shooting.
She said: "I just seen Raoul jump up. I think he came from the window. He just appeared."
Prosecutor Robert Smith QC asked whether Moat had anything in his hands.
Miss Stobbart replied: "A gun. A gun. I did not see the gun at first. Then I seen him load it."
When Mr Smith asked, "Did it happen quickly?", she nodded silently, adding: "Chris walked in front of me."
Moat then raised the sawn-off double-barrelled shotgun and shot Mr Brown in the chest.
She told the court: "Chris went down to the grass and I followed him. I remember Raoul was shouting. I don't know what. Shouting. He pointed the gun at my legs and I ran into the house.
"I could not see anybody. I was panicking because my daughter was upstairs and I was running about the house looking for the keys and I did not know what they looked like.
"I heard two shots. When I looked out the window it was done."
The jury was told a shotgun round pierced Miss Stobbart's arm then hit her liver, stomach and pancreas, causing life-threatening injuries.
She said: "I did not fall to the ground straight away. It took about 20 seconds then I just collapsed.
"Blood was pumping from my arm and pumping from my chest.
"I was dragged through to the kitchen and then I was waiting for ever for the ambulance to come."
Surgeons at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Gateshead operated on Miss Stobbart for eight hours.
The trial continues.
