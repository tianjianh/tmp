Gwynedd rapist Alexander Thomas gets indeterminate jail

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A sex attacker has been told by a judge he showed "contempt and arrogance" towards women as he was given an indeterminate sentence for five rapes.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Alexander Thomas, 27, of Penygroes, Gwynedd, must serve six years before being considered for parole.
His victims were 21, 17 and 14 at the time, Caernarfon Crown Court heard.
The former Bangor University student, who denied the charges, raped the 14-year-old in the university gardens as she went home from school.
Judge Dafydd Hughes told Thomas he displayed "contempt and arrogance and an almost flippant attitude" towards the way he treated young women.
Judge Hughes said his youngest victim had been raped three times and Thomas had shown disregard for anyone who was vulnerable.
Gordon Hennell, prosecuting, said two of the women had self-harmed after their ordeal and the other said she felt isolated and scarred.
Simon Mills, defending, said Thomas would find being in prison for a long time a "very difficult experience."
"He's talented, articulate and highly intelligent," Mr Mills said.
"He had university education but it would now be extremely difficult to use his talents."
As well as the indeterminate sentence, Thomas will also be on the sex offenders' register for life.
Thomas stood with arms folded in the dock as the judge sentenced him.
After the court hearing, police investigating the case welcomed Thomas's sentence.
Det Con Andrew Edwards of North Wales Police said: "It is important to reassure all sections of the community that North Wales Police will provide the appropriate specialist support to assist victims through every stage of the process."
He said police took such crimes very seriously and it was reassuring to see this reflected in the sentence.
