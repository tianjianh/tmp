The mild weather is believed to have contributed to a big turnout for festive swims around the East Coast.

About 300 people braved the North Sea at Cromer Pier earlier, with thousands looking on from the promenade.
"I think it could well have been a record year, with more spectators than ever before, too," said organiser Clive Hedges.
Christmas Day swims were also held at Lowestoft and Felixstowe in Suffolk, Clacton, Essex and Hunstanton, Norfolk.
Mike Rodwell, who took part in the Clacton swim, said the North Sea was an "unusually warm" 10C for Friday's dip.
"A crowd of over 500 watched well over 100 hardy souls," he added.
The annual event in Cromer has taken place in the seaside town since 1985 when it was originally organised as "a bit of a dare" and is now a much anticipated tradition in the seaside town.
Air temperatures were below zero in 2014, but were a comparatively balmy 15C on Saturday.
Mr Hedges added: "The event has grown in popularity but the mild weather helped.
"I can assure you the sea was as cold as ever though."
He said he hoped the event raised about Â£2,000 for Mesothelioma UK, an asbestos-related cancer charity, in memory of runner Alec Fraser, who died last year.
