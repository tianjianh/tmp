'Great progress' in London suburban rail plans

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The final plans for Transport for London (TfL) to take over suburban rail services in the capital could be announced in April, mayor Boris Johnson has said.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The move would see TfL take over West Anglia and Southeastern London services.
A recent report concluded there were "no barriers" to further rail devolution in the capital.
Mr Johnson said "great progress" had been made in developing the plans.
Currently, with the exception of the London Overground network, rail services into the capital are provided by several train operating companies, each with their own franchise agreement with central government.
Mr Johnson said that bringing the services under TfL's control would simplify ticketing and bring savings of Â£100m to help fund improvements.
