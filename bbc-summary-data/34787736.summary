Alistair Carmichael memo leak was 'unguided missile'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Orkney and Shetland MP Alistair Carmichael launched an "unguided missile" after a memo was leaked, a special election court has heard.

Four constituents have raised the action against the Lib Dem under the Representation of the People Act 1983.
They say he misled voters over the memo which was leaked before May's election.
The QC representing the constituents said the former Scottish secretary never believed he would be exposed over the leaked memo.
The contents of the memo, published in the Daily Telegraph at the start of the election campaign in April, claimed that SNP leader and Scottish first minister Nicola Sturgeon would secretly prefer Tory leader David Cameron as prime minister rather than his Labour opponent Ed Miliband.
An inquiry was later begun into the circumstances surrounding the leak.
Jonathan Mitchell QC told the hearing in Edinburgh: "He goes into the inquiry with three people knowing truth of the matter - himself, Mr Roddin [Alistair Carmichael's adviser] and Mr Simon Johnston of the Daily Telegraph.
"We have here a Liberal Democrat MP and a Liberal Democrat advisor who wish to launch this unguided missile into the blue.
"And he goes for that purpose to a Conservative supporting journalist at a Conservative supporting newspaper."
The newspaper said her comments, reportedly made to the French ambassador, undermined claims that she wanted to build a "progressive alliance" with other left-wing parties.
Mr Carmichael - who was Scottish secretary in the Tory-Lib Dem coalition before the election and is now his party's only MP in Scotland - authorised the leaking of a civil service memo by his special adviser.
Both the ambassador and the first minister later denied the accuracy of the civil service memo.
At the time of the leak, Mr Carmichael claimed in a TV interview the first he had heard of it was when he received a phone call from a reporter.
The court heard how a Cabinet Office inquiry into the leak was launched shortly after the newspaper article was printed on 3 April.
Mr Carmichael told the court he was initially "less than fully truthful" with the inquiry.
Mr Carmichael's lawyers argue his actions were political and did not affect his re-election.
Mr Carmichael admitted on Tuesday that he tried to mislead the Cabinet Office investigation.
The election court in Edinburgh is hearing evidence from six witnesses over four days, in what is believed to be the first case of its kind in Scotland for 50 years.
Legal argument was earlier heard in September, and was broadcast and streamed live online.
The evidence from witnesses during this week's hearing has not been  broadcast, but the lawyers' closing statements will be broadcast.
The two judges, Lady Paton and Lord Matthews, will present their judgement to the House of Commons at a later date.
