[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
League Two side Yeovil have extended Bournemouth forward Brandon Goodship's loan spell until the end of the season.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Goodship has scored one goal in seven games for the Glovers since joining on an initial one-month deal in February.
The 21-year-old, who has yet to make a senior appearance for Bournemouth, returned to action for the Cherries' under-21 side in January after 18 months out with a knee injury.
Yeovil are 20th in League Two, 11 points above the relegation zone.
