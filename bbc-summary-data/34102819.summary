The Blues had been linked with the Tunisia defender on Saturday in several newspapers, but hours later the La Liga side announced his arrival on a five-year deal.
"I chose Valencia out of all the offers I received because it is a big club in Spain and Europe," he said.
"I had no doubts. I am delighted to be joining the best league in the world."
