NI League Cup final: Ballymena injury concern over prolific midfielder Tony Kane

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Ballymena United have an injury concern over Tony Kane for Saturday's League Cup final against Carrick Rangers.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The midfielder is doubtful with a hamstring injury sustained five minutes from the end of Saturday's Premiership defeat by Crusaders at Seaview.
The 29-year-old is the club's second top scorer this season, having notched 18 goals, 12 of those from penalties and four from free-kicks.
Kane joined Ballymena from Cliftonville in 2011 and can play at right back.
Only striker Cathair Friel, with 19 goals, has found the net more often for United than Kane.
Both Ballymena and Carrick are looking to win the League Cup for the first time in their history and the clubs are meeting in a domestic decider for the first time since the 1984 Irish Cup final, which Ballymena won 4-1.
United have picked up the County Antrim Shield twice in recent years, but were losing finalists in the 2014 Irish Cup final and the 2015 League Cup decider.
Carrick last picked up senior silverware in the 1992-93 season, when they collected the County Antrim Shield.
Ballymena manager David Jeffrey won the League Cup six times during his time as manager of Linfield.
Ballymena reached the final by beating Newington YC, Linfield, Warrenpoint Town and Coleraine while Carrick accounted for Ballyclare Comrades, Armagh City, Dungannon Swifts and Glenavon.
