[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Cosmin, 37 and Ana Focsa, 40, of Blackpool, were found guilty of ill treating the 88-year-old in July 2015.
The woman, who suffers from dementia, was found in her bed at Alistre Lodge Nursing Home, St Annes wrapped so tightly she could not free herself.
The couple were given 16-week sentences, suspended for 12 months.
The husband and wife were also ordered to pay Â£200 each to the woman and to carry out 200 hours unpaid community work .
The pair were dismissed from the care home following the incident on 11 July, 2015.
The prosecution said it was a callous, cruel and selfish act.
In mitigation, Blackpool Magistrates' Court was told the Romanian couple had no previous offences and had spent years doing worthwhile volunteer work for the Red Cross in Romania.
