[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Kyle Lafferty saved Northern Ireland from a damaging Euro 2016 defeat with a stoppage-time goal against Hungary.

The home side could have qualified for their first major tournament in 30 years with a win but fell behind when Richard Guzmics prodded home from goalkeeper Michael McGovern's mistake.
Chris Baird was then sent off for two rapid yellow card offences before Lafferty smashed home.
Two points from games against Greece and Finland will seal qualification.
The part-renovated Windsor Park was rocking throughout as an expectant home crowd hoped to see Northern Ireland reach a major finals for the first time since the 1986 World Cup in Mexico.
But, despite a dominant first-half display, a horrible lapse in judgement from Hamilton keeper McGovern looked like leaving the hosts in a nervous second place in Group F, just a point above Hungary.
McGovern failed to hold a straightforward free-kick from Balazs Dzsudzsak, allowing Guzmics to tap in.
With defeat looking inevitable, Lafferty snapped up his seventh goal of the Group F campaign to equalise when Gabor Kiraly could not hold substitute Niall McGinn's low drive to put qualification back in Northern Ireland's own hands.
Striker Lafferty, defender Conor McLaughlin and Baird will be suspended for the 8 October visit of Greece.

Northern Ireland were already a goal down when the dismissal of Baird in the 81st minute provided a big talking point at Windsor Park.
Referee Cuneyt Cakir showed Baird two yellow cards, one after the other, before sending him off, to the confusion and anger of many home players.
Northern Ireland felt he should have only been booked once, but the referee indicated he was cautioning Baird for two fouls in the same move after playing an advantage.
Manager Michael O'Neill was left baffled by the decision of the Turkish official.
"Chris would not have made the second tackle if he knew he was being booked for the first," he said.
"I've never seen that before in a game in all my life."
In the circumstances, O'Neill will be hugely relieved to get a point from the match.
If Lafferty had not scored his dramatic stoppage-time equaliser, Northern Ireland might have been left needing to win their last two games against Greece and Finland.
Instead a single win, or two draws, will be enough to secure a top-two place in Group F thanks to a now superior head-to-head record with Hungary, who they beat 2-1 in Budapest a year ago.
Lafferty remains frozen out of the picture at club side Norwich - whom he has not played for since January.
However, only Bayern Munich duo Robert Lewandowski (10 for Poland) and Thomas Muller (eight for Germany) have more Euro 2016 qualification goals than the 27-year-old.
With no real stand-out performances, Kyle Lafferty gets the vote for his precious, point-saving goal. The striker has not been able to get a game with Norwich this season but has been a revelation for his country. the only blot was the booking which sees him pick up a one-game ban.
Northern Ireland next host Greece in Belfast on 8 October, before ending their campaign in Finland three days later.
A win in either match would book a place at the finals in France next summer.
