Gallantree competed in her first international event in 2004 and won gold at the 2014 Commonwealth Games in the women's 3m synchronised springboard alongside Alicia Blagg.
The 32-year-old from Chelmsford won the team event at the 2015 World Championships alongside Tom Daley.
"I have achieved more in my career than I ever thought possible," she said.
"Representing Team GB at three Olympic Games, winning a Commonwealth gold medal with Alicia, and a World Championship gold medal with Tom were all things that I would never have imagined 10 years ago.
"Competing in front of a home crowd at London 2012, in particular, will always be one of my fondest memories.
"I hope that my diving career has helped show what can be achieved with passion, determination, and hard work."
