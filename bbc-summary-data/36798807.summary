Some Maasai communities still believe that FGM - when parts of a girl's genitals are removed - should be continued as some see it as a cultural rite of passage marking when a girl becomes a woman and can marry.
Maasai Cricket Warriors captain Sonyanga Ole Ngais tells the BBC how he and his team-mates are trying to discourage the custom by refusing to marry girls who have undergone the brutal procedure.
