Paul Davies and Tom Matthews missed out on gold and silver on countback in the round-robin men's class 1, losing their last tie against top seeds South Korea.
Paul Karabardak, David Wetherill and Martin Perry moved into the semi-finals of the men's class 6 as group winners, but lost in the last four to Croatia.
Sue Gilroy and Megan Shackleton also won bronze in the women's class 4-5.
In the round-robin event, the pair still had a chance of winning gold in their final match against top seeds Serbia, but Paralympic champion Borislava Peric-Rankovic and Rio 2016 bronze medallist Nada Matic defeated them.
