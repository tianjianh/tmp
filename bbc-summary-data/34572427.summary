STV is set to become the last remaining independent business in the Channel 3 network.

ITVplc said on Monday it was buying Ulster Television in Belfast for Â£100m.
It will leave STV as the last standalone operator in the network, which was originally made up of about 15 separate companies.
In a BBC interview last month, former ITV boss Michael Grade said STV was "defying gravity" by remaining independent.
Until the mid-90s, the Channel 3 network was made up of a number of fiercely independent regional companies.
A series of mergers and takeovers led to the creation of ITVplc which will shortly control all of the network, except STV's transmission area in central and northern Scotland.
STV has long had to endure speculation - which, so far, has turned out to be groundless - that it could also be swallowed up by ITV.
Analysts say UTV came into play because it recently launched a station aimed at the Irish Republic.
However, the new station's losses have been far heavier than expected.
