[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Glasgow Warriors' Champions Cup hopes suffered a significant setback as they were comprehensively beaten by Pool Three leaders Racing 92 in Paris.

Tries from Ben Tameifuna, Dimitri Szarzewski, Eddy Ben Arous and Manuel Carizza secured a bonus point in a dominant display from the home pack.
Dan Carter contributed 12 points with the boot as the French side moved seven points clear of Northampton.
Leone Nakarawa crossed for a consolation try for Warriors.
Finn Russell and Carter traded penalties in an opening half hour littered with handling errors and turnovers.
After subdued start to the match, delayed after the Paris attacks in November, Racing showed their class to score the game's opening try.
With Carter pulling the Warriors defence one way and then the other, number eight Chris Masoe blasted through to the brink of the tryline, before prop Tameifuna ploughed over from close range. Carter added the conversion and another penalty to give the home side a 13-3 half-time lead.
If Racing started the first half in sluggish fashion, there was to be no repeat in the second period as they powered over the line with an unstoppable rolling maul. Captain Szarzewski was the man to ground the ball, with Carter again on target with the conversion.
Warriors now had no response to the power of the French pack, and Ben Arous scored in almost identical fashion as Racing surged way in front at 27-3.
A smart line-out move allowed Nakarawa to dive over as Glasgow refused to throw in the towel, but yet another powerful driving maul sent Carizza over the line for Racing's fourth try in the final play of the game.
Carter has quickly become a favourite of the Racing fans, and although he did not hit top gear, he never really had to as he effortlessly pulled the strings.
The double World Cup winner did the simple things well; bringing his big ball carriers into the line, kicking well from hand and perfectly at goal, nailing all five attempts from the tee.
The All Blacks great departed on 56 minutes to a rousing reception from the Parisian crowd.
The defending champions sit in the bottom half of the Pro12 table, and this defeat - their third in a row in all competitions - leaves their European aspirations very much in the balance.
They visit Northampton next before ending their campaign against Racing at Scotstoun, and will have to win both matches in order to have any chance of reaching the quarter-finals.
