Jeff Lynne's ELO burst onto the Pyramid Stage to play the Sunday afternoon "legend slot", as the heavens opened over Glastonbury.

Backed by a full string section, the band opened with the 1976 track Evil Woman followed by Showdown.
"Hello Glastonbury," said Lynne. "It's great to be here."
A crowd of thousands watched the show, but the band couldn't quite match the numbers who turned out for Dolly Parton in 2014 or Lionel Richie last year.
Many of the spectators confessed they were unfamiliar with the band's music.
"My mum would've killed me if I didn't come to see them, to be honest," one told the BBC.
"My dad likes them," added another. "He used to listen to them in the car, so I thought I'd come along."
But many were won over by the band's orchestrated rock symphonies.
"I'm lovin' it in the rain," said one.
Lynne, never the most effusive of frontmen, also appeared to be enjoying the experience. "That was great, that. You were fabulous," he announced after the caudience sang and clapped along to Mr Blue Sky.
After the closing number, Roll Over Beethoven, he turned his back to the crowd for a commemorative selfie.
Coldplay will top the bill at the Pyramid Stage at 21:30 BST, setting a record as the first band to headline the festival four times.
Their show promises to be visually spectacular, with 100,000 interactive LED wristbands distributed to the audience, which will pulse in time to the music.
Pop singer Alessia Cara, who is supporting Coldplay on their current European tour, said the set would be a "psychedelic" blast of colour.
"It's the biggest show I've ever seen in my life," she told the BBC.  "It's just boom, boom, boom, one thing after another, and it looks like a kaleidoscope."
Coldplay frontman Chris Martin, meanwhile, said their set would be an antidote to last week's Brexit vote.
"We're in a time when a lot of things separate and divide us - Brexit, walls - so hopefully our concerts are saying the opposite at the moment," he told the Guardian.
After Adele's celebratory performance on Saturday night, the Pyramid Stage opened in a gentle mood on Sunday - with the Burnham and Highbridge Brass Band playing mellow covers of songs like A Whiter Shade Of Pale.
The vibe continued with Gregory Porter's soulful blend of R&B and jazz and Laura Mvula's unique brand of pastoral funk.
Porter's set saw a couple join him on stage and get engaged while he sang Real Good Hands, which is about a proposal.
He told the crowd: "Wish them luck for the rest of their lives, Tom and Zoe, Tom and Zoe."
Also on the line-up for Sunday are Ellie Goulding, PJ Harvey, LCD Soundsystem and Beck.
Speaking at a press conference on Friday morning, Glastonbury organiser Michael Eavis said Glastonbury had seen its worst rain and mud in 46 years.
He also revealed that the fan who brought Adele's set to a halt on Saturday, due to a medical emergency, had had a "Lazarus" recovery.
"Came off in stretcher, was helped up and just walked away," he told reporters.
