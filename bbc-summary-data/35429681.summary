The Art of Romance features original illustrations of cover art from its back catalogue of bodice rippers.
The publisher said it records "the most iconic Mills & Boon moments since it was founded in 1908".
Adult colouring books have been a publishing success over the past 12 months, with five currently in the UK's top 50 book chart.
"Colouring is a key trend in publishing at the moment, and as a heritage brand, with our archive of over 100 years of iconic covers, we were spoiled for choice in creating the book," Lisa Milton, of Mills & Boon publisher Harlequin, said.
"In bringing together the vintage covers, snippets of social history and utterly fabulous fashions across the decades, I can't think of a better way to tell the story of Mills & Boon than through The Art of Romance."
'Easy win'
Tom Tivnan, features editor of industry newspaper The Bookseller, said it was "an easy win" for publishers to bring out a colouring book.
"Adult colouring books continue to be the biggest growth category in the industry, rising last year by about 700%," he told the BBC.
"The first wave of books were by the likes of Millie Marota, and now a lot of brands are branching out like Mills & Boon, Harry Potter and even a Game of Thrones colouring book came out at Christmas.
"More and more are coming because it's an easy win to bring out a colouring book. The difficulty is when will it stop? Maybe it will all come crashing down one day, but so far it seems colouring books will be just as popular this year as it was last year."
The Art of Romance will be released in May.
