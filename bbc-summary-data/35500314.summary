The Rail, Maritime and Transport (RMT) union said its 1,500 of its members would first walkout on 12 February for 24 hours.
Seven separate strikes are planned up to June over what the RMT calls "lethal changes to track access."
LU said safety was its top priority and more talks were planned next week.

Why there could be a 48-hour Tube station staff strike this weekend
In a separate row over jobs, pay and rosters, staff working at stations are due to walk out from 21:00 GMT on 6 February for 48 hours.
But the RMT said last-minute talks over that issue had been "detailed and constructive".
Transport for London has warned some Tube stations will not open on Sunday and Monday if the strike by station staff goes ahead on Saturday.
Talking about the strike by maintenance staff, RMT general secretary Mick Cash said: "From a situation where everyone knew how to access the track, we now have anarchy and uncertainty.
"Into this mix we have engineering train movements that we believe will lead to someone being killed and this union will not sit back and wait for a disaster to happen.
"These ill-conceived and lethal changes to track access must be reversed."
LU's Steve Griffiths said: "Safety is always our top priority and we have robust and comprehensive procedures in place to ensure that any staff working on the track are kept safe and are aware of any train movements.
"We have talked to our trade unions extensively about the changes we have made to track access for engineering work and will continue these discussions next week."
