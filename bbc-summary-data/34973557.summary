[SN]TITLE[SN]
'Exhausted' rural schools 'need better funding'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Rural schools "exhausted by the continual threat of closure" need more money, parents and pupils have said in a petition to the assembly.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Around 120 schools have closed across Wales in recent years, due to lower pupil numbers and financial pressures.
Carmarthenshire, Ceredigion and Powys have been particularly affected.
Ministers said they understood rural schools' challenges and council funding took account of the higher costs of providing education in such areas.
A Welsh government spokesman added that education spending per head in Wales was higher than in England.
