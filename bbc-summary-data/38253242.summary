GAA Inter-provincials: Ulster v Munster semi moved to Sunday

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The inter-pro football semi-final between Ulster and Munster has been moved to Sunday because of the funeral of Ulster secretary Danny Murphy.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Mr Murphy, a long-serving Gaelic Games administrator, died on Thursday, aged 67, after a long illness.
His funeral takes place in Burren near Newry on Saturday at 12:00 GMT.
The Ulster/Munster game will be staged on Sunday at Dublin's Parnell Park (14:00 GMT) with the same provinces' hurlers in action at Thurles at 13:45.
The Leinster v Connacht fixtures will still be played on Saturday. The hurling semi-final is at MacDonagh Park, Nenagh, at 14:45, with the football taking place at Parnell Park at 18:00.
The semi-finals and finals are usually played over one weekend but the GAA's Central Competitions Control Committee will now have to work out dates and times for the finals.
The competitions did not take place last year because of bad weather.
Connacht are the holders of the football title and Leinster are the current hurling champions.
