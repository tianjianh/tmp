Evha Jannath was on a school trip when she fell from the Splash Canyon ride at Drayton Manor Theme Park on 9 May.
Staffordshire Police and the Health and Safety Executive are investigating her death.
More than 100 mourners attended a service at Saffron Hill Cemetery in Leicester before her coffin was taken away for burial.
The Muslim Burial Council of Leicestershire said Evha's death had "touched the hearts of many people".
Its chairman Suleman Nagdi urged people not to speculate on the details surrounding the Leicester schoolgirl's death.

An inquest is expected to open following a post-mortem examination on Monday.
The service in Evha's memory was short.
Hundreds of mourners packed into a room at the Saffron Hill Cemetery, with many more left standing outside.
It was attended by male relatives and members of the community in Leicester, many of whom may not know the family as they are new to the area, but were there to show their support.
A prayer was said before the coffin was removed from the building for burial.
Afterwards the head teacher of Evha's school said her classmates had been given the afternoon off and they would all "go back in tomorrow with a heavy heart".
The theme park, near Tamworth, Staffordshire, temporarily closed following Evha's death but reopened on Saturday.
Head teacher of the Jameah Girls Academy, Erfana Bora, said Evha's friends had been given the morning off school to visit her family and to say their goodbyes.
"Evha's mum has asked me to keep her name on the school register," she said.
"I'm happy to do so as Evha will always be in our hearts and a part of our school."
Spokesman for the family, Keith Vaz, said: "This is a terrible day, not just for [the family] but for all of us in Leicester.
"A huge number of people turned out to show the support and love that we have for the family and the devotion and sadness of this very young girl's death.
"This tragedy has affected so many people."
