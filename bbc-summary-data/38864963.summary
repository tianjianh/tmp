[SN]TITLE[SN]
Portsmouth 2-0 Accrington Stanley

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Matt Clarke and Kal Naismith scored to help promotion-chasing Portsmouth return to winning ways with a home success against lowly Accrington.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Portsmouth needed the points after back-to-back defeats in League Two and Paul Cook's men got off to the perfect start.
Only 45 seconds had elapsed when Gary Roberts forced a fine save from Accrington goalkeeper Marek Rodak.
From the resulting corner Roberts picked out Clarke at the far post and the centre-back headed into the net.
The same combination almost doubled Pompey's lead on 20 minutes but this time Clarke nodded over from Roberts' centre.
It took until the half hour for Accrington to muster a meaningful attempt on goal when Sean McConville blazed wide from inside the penalty area.
Clarke twice came close to doubling his and Pompey's tally early in the second half but could not hit the target with either attempt.
Substitute Naismith sealed the victory in added time, slotting home after being sent clear by Noel Hunt.
