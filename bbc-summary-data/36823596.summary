Residents and commuters took to social media after the chimney at Didcot power station apparently vanished, leading to fears it had accidently collapsed.

It came the day after the remains of the boiler house were demolished and the search resumed for three men killed when the building partially came down.
However, site owner RWE NPower reassured people the tower was still standing and had been shrouded in fog.
It would be demolished in future, a spokeswoman added.
Paul Brassett tweeted: "Local reports that Didcot power station stack came down overnight. Might want to check it out."
Drew Simpson tweeted: "Just been along the perimeter road in Didcot and can't see the tall tower - suspect it may have come down."
Elliot Harvey tweeted: "Any ideas if it was planned to bring down the tall chimney at the power station, or is it another accident."
RWE said Sunday's demolition of the boiler house had "gone as planned".
