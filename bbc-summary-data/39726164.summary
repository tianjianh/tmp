Jones, 24, has not competed since beating Hedaya Malak in the World Grand Prix final last December.
The London 2012 and Rio 2016 Olympic champion took time out from training earlier this year to take part in the winter-sports reality show The Jump.
"I don't have anything to prove after defending my Olympic title," she said.
"It's all about enjoying the competition. I'm not putting any pressure on myself because I have only been back in full training for about a month.
"But I don't go anywhere to lose. I have had a good enough break and this time I feel ready to comeback myself."
Jones will be fighting at -57kg and is preparing for June's World Championships in Muju, South Korea.
Fellow British competitors Max Cater, Josh Calland and Bradly Sinden will be also be in action on day one of the four-day event in the Greek capital.
Cater won the German Open title earlier this year and finished runner-up in the opening President's Cup event held in Morocco, where Sinden also won a medal.
