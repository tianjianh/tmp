Queenie Law, the granddaughter of the owner of the Bossini clothing chain, was taken from her home in the Sai Kung area of Hong Kong in late April.
The gang, who also seized valuables, held Ms Law until her family paid HK$28m ($3.6m; Â£2.3m).
The South China Morning Post reported that five other suspects had also been detained.
The men were arrested in Guangdong province in mainland China on Monday, the paper reported late on Tuesday, but this has not been confirmed by Hong Kong police.
The man in court on Wednesday, surnamed Zheng, was arrested at the Lo Wu border crossing on Sunday night as he was trying to leave Hong Kong.
He did not enter a plea and the case has been adjourned until Monday, said broadcaster RTHK.
On Tuesday, he was led hooded around parts of Kowloon by police trying to reconstruct the events around the kidnapping.
The case has gripped Hong Kong, which has very low levels of violent crime. Police had set up road blocks across the territory and combed rural areas looking for Ms Law.
She was released unharmed by the gang after four days, but the ransom money has not been recovered.
The BBC's Juliana Liu in Hong Kong says when the territory was still a British colony, a number of high-profile kidnappings targeting the city's richest families shocked the public.
Since reverting to Chinese rule, such cases have become much rarer, she says.
