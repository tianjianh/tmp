Crossrail carriage passes extreme-weather tests

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Extreme weather conditions have proved no match for Crossrail engineers whose train carriage has passed three weeks of rigorous testing.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Snowy, windy and foggy conditions, as well as temperatures ranging from -25C (-13F) to 40C (104F), were simulated in a climatic wind tunnel in Vienna.
In tests the front high-speed rail carriage proved itself equal to the variable British weather.
Crossrail will open in 2017 linking 40 stations in London and the South East.
Named the Elizabeth Line in honour of the Queen, it is due to open in May.
Operations director Howard Smith said: "It's important that we check that the new trains can operate in anything that the changing British weather can throw at them and it won't be long before our customers will be able to get on board a train."
Weather simulations tested the heating, ventilation, air-conditioning system, windscreen wipers, demister, train horns and traction motors.
The carriage, built by Bombardier Transportation in Derby, has returned to London for night testing.
