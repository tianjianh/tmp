Rangers manager Mark Warburton is confident captain Lee Wallace and winger Harry Forrester will be fit to face Celtic next weekend.

The pair were withdrawn during the Challenge Cup final win over Peterhead after suffering knocks.
But Warburton confirmed that the injuries were not serious ahead of next Sunday's return to Hampden for the Scottish Cup semi-final.
However, the Rangers boss has concerns over the Hampden pitch.
The grass, which was installed just five weeks ago in time for the League Cup final, will be replaced on Monday and Tuesday.
But Warburton questioned the timing and reckons those running the national stadium should be paying for a hybrid surface like the one used at Murrayfield, the home of Scottish rugby.
"The pitch was difficult," he said after the 4-0 win against Peterhead. "It was hard to play on.
"I know a lot of work is going on but you've got to question how a new pitch can bed down in such a short time.
"My concern is if we have any adverse weather on the Thursday and Friday then have Hibs and Dundee United playing on it on Saturday before we play Celtic on Sunday. I'm not sure how you bed in a new pitch in three days' time.
"I understand there's problems and you have to find a solution as swiftly as possible. But it is surprising.
"How much does it cost to relay the pitch? With the amount of times it is being done, should you not go for the more expensive option in the beginning which proved to be the cheaper option in the long run?"
The latest pitch instalment will be done free of charge following what Peter Dallas, managing director of Hampden Park Ltd, described as their recent "six-figure investment".
