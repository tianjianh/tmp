Mark Hogarth, of Lewis-based Harris Tweed Hebrides, is in ReykjavÃ­k to take part in an event celebrating the Queen's 90th birthday.
The British embassy in Iceland, along with others around the world, are holding the celebratory trade events.
Jaguar Land Rover and British Airways have also been invited to ReykjavÃ­k.
More than 1,200 guests are expected at Wednesday's event which will be held in the grounds of the ambassador's residence.
Harris Tweed Hebrides will present a show using garments from retailer Walker Slater of Edinburgh and Elizabeth Martin, a designer based in Carluke in South Lanarkshire.
There will also be meetings with Icelandic retailers.
Mr Hogarth said: "Iceland is a small potential market but it punches far above its weight in global fashion and design which have become central to its economic strategy following the banking crash.
"It has also become a huge tourism destination, marketing itself as a crossroads between Europe and North America, as well as a port of call for hundreds of cruise ships each year.
"Harris Tweed sits very well alongside the high-quality knitwear in which Iceland itself specialises."
Significant importers of the fabric, which is woven on the Western Isles, are Germany, USA and Japan.
