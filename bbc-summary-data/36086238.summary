[SN]TITLE[SN]
Head of Welsh civil service Sir Derek Jones to step down

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The head of the Welsh civil service has announced he will stand down from the role at the end of the year.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Permanent Secretary Sir Derek Jones has held the job since October 2012.
He emailed staff to say he would leave after ensuring that "a new first minister and cabinet hit the ground running".
The Welsh Government said arrangements for the appointment of a successor would be finalised "in due course".
In the email, Sir Derek said: "Although we'll continue to be busy, I hope the next few weeks will give us all the opportunity to find time for a bit of reflection on the huge amount that's been achieved and what we can do to prepare for the all-consuming early months of the new Assembly term."
He added: "But, before that begins, I wanted to let you know about my own personal plans, which are to step down from the role of Permanent Secretary at the end of the year.
"By that time we will have helped a new First Minister and Cabinet to hit the ground running and the new Programme for Government will be well under way.
"There will also be sufficient time for a competition to appoint my successor.
"You will hear more from me about all this in the coming months."
