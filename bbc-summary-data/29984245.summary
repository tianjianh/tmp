The county council started demolishing the maisonettes in Flint in 2012 as part of its masterplan to unlock space.
A community consultation highlighted the "poor physical appearance" of the grey brick 1970s homes and the need to make the town "better connected".
A 3D model goes on show on Monday revealing the new proposals.
A council spokesperson said: "The proposals aim to develop Flint as a viable and attractive town that better serves the needs of the existing community and also has the ability to attract people from outside the town."
The plans can be viewed at the Old Court House between noon and 19:00 GMT.
