The incident happened at about 16:40 on Saturday during the SPFL game at Tynecastle Stadium in Edinburgh.
Police said a 48-year-old man had been charged with offensive behaviour at football and an offence under the Threatening Communications Act.
He has been released on bail and will appear in court at a later date.
Police Scotland said the man had been given special bail conditions not to enter within half a mile of Tynecastle Stadium, or any other ground where Hearts are playing, for two hours before the match until two hours after it has finished.
PC Gavin Stupart said: "Since Kilmarnock FC reported this matter we have been carrying our extensive inquiries alongside Hearts and I would like to thank them for their assistance and support now that we have made an arrest.
"Offensive behaviour at football matches will not be tolerated and whenever we identify those responsible we will ensure they are brought before the court.
"We will also seek special bail conditions and banning orders to prevent offenders from attending further football matches."
Magennis, 25, a striker for Northern Ireland, is in his second season at Kilmarnock and has scored 10 goals this term.
