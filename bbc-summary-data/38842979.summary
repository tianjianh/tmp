We've Moved

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Thanks for visiting the BBC Ouch blog. We've decided to move all of our best features, videos and audio to the BBC Ouch programmes page. The very best of the BBC's stories and analysis about disability and mental health can be found on the disability news index.

Even though we're no longer updating this blog you might want to scroll through it anyway as there are some great posts which might be of interest.
We're still producing our weekly podcasts and monthly talk-shows so make sure you tune in for those and sign up here so they automatically download for you. Don't forget to tweet, email or visit our Facebook page to tell us your news as we love to hear from you.
Thanks for everything!
The BBC Ouch team
