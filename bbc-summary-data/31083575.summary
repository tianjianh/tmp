England self-destructed against Australia - captain Eoin Morgan

Captain Eoin Morgan says England had themselves to blame for their heavy tri-series final loss to Australia.

Mitchell Johnson took 3-27 on his international return as England fell to a 112-run defeat in their final competitive match before the World Cup.
But Morgan insisted his own team's shortcomings were the reason for defeat, not old adversary Johnson.
"I don't think he was the biggest threat," Morgan said. "We were. We pushed the self-destruct button."
Johnson - whose last competitive match was on Boxing Day - destroyed England during the last winter's Ashes whitewash, taking 37 wickets as he was named player of the series.
Having been told that England were reportedly unconcerned about the pace bowlers' efforts in a one-sided contest in Perth, Australia's Glenn Maxwell - who finished with figures of 4-46 - said: "They should be concerned. He had three for 11 at one stage and tore through their top order.
"They can be not worried, but if they're getting skittled by him they probably should be."
Morgan, though, preferred to look at the positives from a tri-series in which England have twice beaten India and some individuals have shone.
Ian Bell's batting has been outstanding, helping him to become England's leading run-scorer in ODIs while Steven Finn took career-best one-day figures of 5-33 against India.
"I am happy with this series as a whole," Morgan said. "Apart from today's game we've made big inroads, and getting to the final was an achievement in itself."
Despite some success, England's new-look one-day side have yet to beat Australia.
They next meet on 14 February in the World Cup, but coach Peter Moores denied that Australia have the measure of England.
"I don't think Australia have a stranglehold over us, they are just playing really good cricket," he said.
"We are getting better fast and we are one of the improving teams in the world. Today we just didn't get it right."
The only downside for Australia was a side injury to James Faulkner, who hit an unbeaten 50 and dismissed Joe Root with his first ball.
"He's down at the moment with such an amazing thing coming up for us - a home World Cup," said Maxwell, who as well as starring with the ball, top-scored for Australia with 95. "We can only hope it is nothing serious."
