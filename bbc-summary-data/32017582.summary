But food expert Doctor Radha Modgil has been explaining what effect junk food can have by taking Newsround reporter Ricky inside the human body.
It's all part of Newsround's big food week where a survey of more than 1,400 children showed one out of three eat unhealthy foods like chocolate, crisps and take away more than three times a week.
You can find out more about the difference between Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes on the Newsround website and send in any questions you have about food for Doctor Radha to answer.
