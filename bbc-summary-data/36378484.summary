Batemans Bay in New South Wales has become overrun by a type of bat known as the grey-headed flying fox.
Residents who live in the town are unhappy, saying the bats are noisy and are causing a mess.
They've been trying to scare the bats away by chopping down trees and making loud noises.
However, animal rights groups are asking the town to be patient as the bats will eventually move on when they are ready.
