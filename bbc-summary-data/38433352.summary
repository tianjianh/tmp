Bury 1-3 Sheffield United

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Sheffield United went three points clear at the top of League One after coming from behind to win at lowly Bury.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Shakers took a 12th-minute lead through Jacob Mellis, only for Billy Sharp to equalise nine minutes later with his 17th goal of the season.
Kelvin Etuhu's own goal put the Blades in front for the first time on 72 minutes before Kieron Freeman sealed a fifth straight win for the Blades, tapping in his second in two games with nine minutes left.
Mellis stunned the league leaders by pouncing on a loose ball to fire home from 20 yards.
But the visitors were soon level as Bury failed to clear John Fleck's inswinging free-kick and Sharp fired home on the turn from close range.
Caolan Lavery was then denied by home goalkeeper Ben Williams before Stefan Scougall and Fleck had shots blocked.
James Vaughan spurned a great chance to restore Bury's lead as he fired wide just after half-time.
And United gradually got on top before Lavery's low cross struck Etuhu and went into Bury's net.
Lavery was again the provider as he squared for Freeman to make it 15 league games without a win for Bury, who are now out of the relegation zone on goal difference only.
