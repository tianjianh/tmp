So Dapper Laughs wasn't killed off at all...

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Back in November, Daniel O'Reilly said he'd killed off his character Dapper Laughs.

Jokes about rape and homelessness caused massive controversy, leading to his TV show being cancelled and a national tour being pulled.
He did a BBC interview, seemingly full of remorse, and said "it was a type of comedy he shouldn't have been doing".
However, a new Youtube video suggests that "death" was very short lived.
The video, entitled "Merry Christmas", shows Dapper Laughs apparently being brought back to Earth and meeting his creator, Daniel O'Reilly.
In this video Daniel O'Reilly is wearing the same outfit he wore on BBC2's Newsnight, which Dapper then teases him about.
"My work down here ain't finished", he tells O'Reilly.
It finishes with Dapper Laughs grinning at the camera before the screen says "Dapper's Back."
There is currently no suggestion as to what will be next for the comic and Newsbeat has approached his representative.
It does however suggest that it was never Daniel O'Reilly's intention to lose the character.
You could argue the apology on Newsnight may have been part of a wider plan for Dapper Laughs.
Earlier in the year, a show in Cardiff was cancelled following a petition by around 700 students who didn't want him to perform at the university.
They said his act "trivialised rape and dehumanised women". Other petitions about tour dates then started appearing online.
Twenty-year-old student Zara Lindsay was behind one of them. She told Newsbeat she didn't want Dapper Laughs performing on the University of Leicester campus.
She said: "Lad culture is quite prevalent these days. It's especially bad on nights out with theme nights, drinking games and sports initiations. Plus there's a general feeling that sexual assault is something that you should just take on a night out.
"Having people like Dapper Laughs holding gigs here suggests that this is an OK attitude and that sends out the wrong message."
