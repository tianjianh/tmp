Nigel McGuire death: Police response criticised

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A police force has been criticised for the way it responded to a distressed Plymouth man who had taken 600ml of methadone and later died in hospital.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Devon and Cornwall Police received calls from Nigel McGuire's girlfriend that she was concerned about him.
The Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) found that an inspector and a call handler had "cases to answer".
An inquest found that Mr McGuire's death was an accident, the IPCC said.
Mr McGuire's girlfriend first called police at 00:50 BST on 14 May 2013 and officers visited at 01:10 and spoke to him through his closed front door, after he refused to open it.
Officers then visited him at 09:00, 10:53 and 15:11 and on each occasion knocked on Mr McGuire's front door but they did not get a response. They also spoke to a neighbour, rang Mr McGuire and left messages on his mobile.
The IPCC said at 21:15 his girlfriend called police and told them he had said "he could not go on like this", which led to officers forcing entry into the property in Plymouth at 23:20 where Mr McGuire was found unconscious and later died in hospital.
Tom Milsom, IPCC associate commissioner, said: "The force held misconduct meetings for an inspector and member of control room staff and we recommended awareness should be raised within Devon and Cornwall Police about methadone poisoning and levels of dosages that give cause for concern."
Following misconduct meetings held by Devon & Cornwall Police a police inspector has received management advice and a police staff radio operator a written warning.
The force said that since his death, "significant changes" in the way it managed incidents involving vulnerable people had been introduced.
"We would like to offer our deepest sympathies to the friends and family of Nigel McGuire who have handled themselves with dignity throughout this difficult process."
