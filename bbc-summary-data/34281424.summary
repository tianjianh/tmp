Ministers move to fill top science advisory post

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Scottish government has announced plans to re-advertise the post of chief scientific officer (CSA) for Scotland by the end of the year.

The position has remained vacant since Prof Muffy Calder stepped down from the role last December.
The post includes providing independent scientific advice to ministers.
Scottish Labour welcomed the announcement but said it was "worrying" that there had been no chief scientific adviser for nine months.
The Scottish government said it would consult with stakeholders on the CSA role in order to ensure that the post attracted a broad field of candidates.
In the meantime, other chief scientists who cover areas such as health and rural affairs, food and the environment, will continue to carry out "key tasks" usually undertaken by the CSA for Scotland.
Last month, Prof Calder warned that plans by Scottish ministers to ban the growing of genetically modified crops could have "apocalyptic" consequences and threaten the country's food and drinks industry.
Her views were echoed by another former CSA for Scotland, Dame Anne Glover.
The move to re-advertise the post was announced by Scottish Education Secretary Angela Constance.
The Scottish government is also looking to recruit new members for the Scottish Science Advisory Council (SSAC).
In announcing the move, Ms Constance urged universities to "join the push" to get more women into all of levels of science.
Ms Constance said: "Women remain under-represented in much of the science, technology and engineering sector, but there is a key area that has made progress in achieving a better gender balance.
"Earlier today I met some of the inspirational women who are leading many of our science centres and science festivals to hear their views on how they have succeeded and what more we can all do to promote Stem (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) as a potential area of study and work for girls and young women.
"I have agreed that we will work together on an action plan to ensure more can be done on such a key issue."
She added: "Having women in senior, visible roles help to show girls and young women that choosing science can open up a range of career possibilities. That is why it is so important to appeal to a wide range of experts as scientific advisers to government.
"I am writing to all university principals and the presidents of our learned societies to encourage them to work with us to ensure we recruit a new chief scientific adviser that will deliver for Scotland."
Labour's opportunity spokesman Iain Gray said: "It is worrying that there has been no chief scientific adviser and no meeting of the Scottish Scientific Advisory Council for the past nine months.
"That apparent lack of interest in science and scientific advice is just unacceptable in the government of a modern 21st-Century country, especially one with Scotland's scientific pedigree."
