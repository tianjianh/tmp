Mr Thabane's party won 48 of the 80 directly contested seats in the 120-strong parliament, the Independent Election Commission said.
Mr Mosisili's Democratic Congress came second with 30 seats. The ABC now needs to form a coalition in order to govern.
It is the third election in three years caused by a bitter power-struggle.
Lesotho has experienced several coups since independence from Britain in 1966. There was no winner with a clear majority in the last election.
The ABC is expected to form a coalition with three other parties in a bid to obtain the 61-seat majority needed to form a government, Reuters news agency reports, quoting a joint statement by the parties.
