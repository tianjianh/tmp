Tranmere Rovers have signed Portuguese winger Erico Sousa from Accrington Stanley for the rest of the season.

Sousa, 22, joined Accrington on 13 February, but registration issues meant the former Portugal Under-19 international did not play a game.
He made 30 appearances for Slovenia's NK Celje last season, after spending the 2013-14 season at Barnsley.
"He has good pace so will add something to the squad we already have here," Tranmere manager Micky Mellon said.
Mellon was on the coaching staff at Barnsley during Sousa's time at Oakwell.
Tranmere are third in the National League, two points off the automatic promotion places with 10 matches left to play.
