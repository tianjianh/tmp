Known as 'Auntie Jane' and 'Auntie Nerys', the pair, who are both grandmothers in their 60s, have worked voluntarily to teach generations of local children to swim and gain their swimming badges, whilst giving many the opportunity to learn life-savings skills in a rural area which includes many lakes and rivers.
"We had no idea we'd won. It was a complete shock but it's marvellous," said Ellis.
Take a look at Get Inspired's handy guide to volunteering to see how you too can get involved.
