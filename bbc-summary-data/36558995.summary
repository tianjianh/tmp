Erhun Oztumer: Walsall sign Peterborough United midfielder on two-year deal

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Walsall have made their second summer signing in a week by bringing in Peterborough United midfielder Erhun Oztumer on a two-year contract.

The deal will officially commence on 1 July, once his current deal with fellow League One side Posh has expired.
Greenwich-born Oztumer, 25, who is of Turkish descent, turned down the offer of a new contract at London Road.
"This was my first choice. Playing against them for two years, I like the way Walsall play," he said.
"I like how they keep the ball. It suits me. Hopefully I can get a lot of assists.
"I'm a player who likes to feed the strikers. And hopefully I can add some goals to the team as well."
Oztumer's acquisition follows the arrival on Tuesday of teenage Bermudian midfielder Kacy Milan Butterfield, the first signing made since Jon Whitney was confirmed as Saddlers manager on 1 June.
Whitney is still waiting to hear before Monday's deadline as to how many of the club's soon to be out-of-contract players will follow the lead set by Amadou Bakayoko and Kieron Morris in signing new deals.
Romaine Sawyers has been offered a new three-year deal, Anthony Forde, Jason Demetriou and Sam Mantom have been offered two years, while Jordan Cook, Paul Downing, Reece Flanagan, Milan Lalkovic, Craig MacGillivray, Liam Roberts and Andy Taylor have all been offered one-year contracts.
Oztumer's seven goals in 57 appearances over his two seasons at Peterborough led to him being nicknamed the 'Turkish Messi' by Posh fans.
"It's something you just have to laugh at," said the 5ft 3in footballer. "The comparison is that I'm short and left footed.
"But I just try to be myself and keep improving and try to be the best I can be."
Another perhaps better comparison with a famous footballing name might be former England striker Ian Wright, who began his career at south London non-league Dulwich Hamlet.
Oztumer, who began his career on Charlton Athletic's books, also made his name with Dulwich Hamlet, scoring over 60 goals in all competitions to help them to the Isthmian League Division One South title in 2012-13.
He also played for three Turkish sides, Manisaspor, Sivasspor and Anadolu Uskudar, before joining Peterborough for an undisclosed fee from Dulwich in June 2014.
