The parents of a murdered teenager have welcomed a decision to make a senior police officer face a misconduct panel.

Georgia Williams, 17, from Wellington, Shropshire, was murdered by Jamie Reynolds in 2013.
The Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) said a senior West Mercia Police officer should appear before a misconduct panel over the force's handling of Reynolds.
Georgia's mother Lynette said she was "really pleased" with the decision.
Mrs Williams said: "Everybody has backed up what we thought initially.
"It has taken three different reports to get them [the IPCC] to say we were correct and somebody should be held to account."
At his trial, Reynolds was described as a sexual deviant who had a "morbid fascination" with depictions of extreme violence and was deemed a potential serial killer.
At the time of his arrest, Reynolds had 16,800 images and 72 videos of extreme pornography on his computer.
These included images of women he knew in which ropes had been digitally added around their necks.
Devon and Cornwall Police was asked to lead an investigation into West Mercia's previous dealings with Reynolds, who had been cautioned by officers for trying to strangle a teenage girl in 2008.
That report found three officers and a member of police staff should face misconduct hearings.
Georgia's family described the report as "very thorough" but appealed to the IPCC calling for stronger measures to be taken against some of the police officers involved.
Her father Steve is himself a serving detective with West Mercia.
The IPCC said it did not believe the four's failings were "serious enough to justify a case for gross misconduct against any of them".
However, it added it did believe one senior officer had a case to answer for misconduct.
"Given the experience of the officer and position of responsibility held at the time of the incident, we took the view that this individual should attend a misconduct meeting for a panel to decide the appropriate action," it said.
A spokesman for West Mercia Police said Devon and Cornwall Police was in the process of making contact with the complainants.
"On conclusion of which we will receive a formal handover from Devon and Cornwall Police," he said.
"At this point we will progress with the misconduct processes and the outcomes will be published on our website."
