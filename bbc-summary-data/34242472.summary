Stormont crisis: DUP will decide on talks move after Northern Ireland Secretary statement

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) leader has said the Northern Ireland Secretary and the Prime Minister know what his party wants before it enters more cross party talks.

He said he hoped DUP concerns would be reflected by Theresa Villiers in the House of Commons on Tuesday.
Her statement will follow meetings with the five main parties in NI on Monday.
Martin McGuinness, Sinn Féin, said if talks failed, an election was the next "logical step".
Following the DUP's meeting with Ms Villiers on Monday, Mr Robinson was asked if his party wanted the government to commit to reviving an Independent Monitoring Commission (IMC) on paramilitary activity.
The IMC was set up in 2004 to monitor paramilitary activity and the normalisation of security measures in Northern Ireland. It stopped work officially in March 2011.
He said there was little point in holding confidential discussions if he was then going to set out his criteria in public.

Previously, the DUP stated it had six demands concerning paramilitary activity, but it has declined to spell out the points in detail.
Mr Robinson said: "I think the government now knows our views on the issues, I certainly don't expect to get an answer before the secretary of state would get on her feet in the House of Commons tomorrow.
"We will listen to what the government has to say and we will reach conclusions as a party after that."
Mr McGuinness said there should be no preconditions in relation to the talks.
"I think it is very important that as we face into the challenges that people recognise that there really only are two choices and those are talks [with] a successful outcome, or elections," he said.
"I think that is a stark choice that is facing all of the parties in this process."
Ulster Unionist Party leader Mike Nesbitt said Sinn Féin's continual denial of the IRA's existence would "kill or cure" devolution in Northern Ireland.
"It is clear to us that the secretary of state agrees with our assessment that Sinn Féin's continual denial of the existence of the IRA is doing huge damage to the political process," he said.
Alex Attwood of the Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) said this week was a "big test for all the political parties, but it is an even bigger test for the two governments".
He said the political negotiations would be judged by the public on whether there was a return to the fundamentals of the Good Friday Agreement and the defence of the rule of law.
Alliance leader David Ford said his party had had a "useful meeting" with Ms Villiers and the Irish Minister for Foreign Affairs, Charlie Flanagan, looking at the arrangements "for the talks that are due to take place".
He said people needed "institutions that worked", but that some parties at Stormont were involved in "silly games".
As politicians met Ms Villiers, they were lobbied by women whose loved ones were killed in the Troubles.
Linda Nash's brother, William, was among 13 people who died after members of the British Army's Parachute Regiment opened fire on civil rights marchers in the Bogside area of Londonderry on 30 January 1972.
She said she and others were worried that politicians were about to grant an amnesty to those responsible for their relatives' deaths.
That would be "too hard a pill to swallow," she said.
Previous talks broke up last week after Mr Robinson stood aside as first minister of Northern Ireland.
His move, and the resignation of three DUP ministers, followed a police assertion that IRA members were involved in a murder.
