Matthew Bentham, from Hylton Castle in Sunderland, has not been seen since 23:00 GMT on Saturday.
The 26-year-old's family has been informed of the discovery while officers continue to search for him, Northumbria Police said.
Ch Insp Julian Bowran said police were "really concerned" for his welfare and were considering the possibility he may have gone into the River Wear.
Mr Bentham left home in his grey Ford Focus estate and a similar car was seen on CCTV on the A19 near the river on Sunday at 02:40 GMT, the force said.
