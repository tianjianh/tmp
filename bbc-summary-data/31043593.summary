The 32 Banksy pieces, which were sold in London at auction house Bonhams, belonged to art gallery owner Steve Lazarides.
Bonhams said the works "performed extremely well" with 30 selling above their high estimates.
The most expensive lot was Rude Copper, depicting a policeman raising a middle finger, which sold for £32,500.
The next most expensive work, Christ with Shopping Bags, raised £22,500.
Flower Thrower sold for £20,625, and Laugh Now and Festival each made £20,000.
The Banksy works were included in a "contemporary lifestyle" auction which also saw pieces by Damien Hirst and Conor Harrington sell above their high estimates.
In total, the auction fetched more than £1m.
Bonhams said it was "delighted" with the success of the auction and said it was a "clear demonstration of Banksy's importance as a figure at the heart of contemporary art with a thriving market and pan-global interest".
