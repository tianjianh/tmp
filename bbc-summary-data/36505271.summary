Former TT winner Ian Bell 58, of Bedlington, Northumberland, died in a crash during a sidecar race.
Andrew Soar 32, of Loughborough, Leicestershire, described as an "experienced competitor", was killed during the senior race.
Mr Bell, was competing with his son, Carl, who was said to be unharmed.
A spokesman for the event's organisers, ACU Events Ltd, said they wished to pass on their "deepest sympathies" to the two men's family and friends.
On Saturday, Paul Shoesmith, 50, was killed in TT practice on the same day as Dwight Beare, 27, while Dean Martin, 58, was killed on 28 May while practising for the Pre-TT classic.
Father-of-two Mr Bell, who made his TT Races debut in 1995, was killed in a crash at Ballaspur.
He claimed TT victory alongside passenger Neil Carpenter in 2003, but retired from the sport after a high speed crash the following year. He returned in 2007 with son Carl in the chair.
Mr Soar died following an accident at Keppel Gate.
He made his mountain course debut at the Manx Grand Prix in 2012, finishing runner up in both the Newcomers A race and Senior MGP in his first year.
Mr Soar won the Senior MGP in 2014 and made his first appearance at the TT in 2015.
