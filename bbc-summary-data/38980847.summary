Chris Grant: Derbyshire chairman to step down in hope of ECB role

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Derbyshire chairman Chris Grant is to step down after six years in charge, in the hope of standing for election to the England & Wales Cricket Board.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Grant, who was elected to the county committee in August 2010, intends to step down after Derbyshire's AGM on Wednesday, 29 March.
Legal director Rob Tice and business development director David Booth will also step down from their roles.
"Serving as chairman for the last six years has been a huge honour," he said.
"However, I have signalled my intention to stand for election to the ECB and I believe that by stepping down from my county role, I will be better equipped, if elected, to discharge the duties of a director of the ECB without conflict.
"I am immensely proud of what we have achieved at Derbyshire over the last six years. Having rescued the club from the brink of financial ruin back in 2010, we have since recorded six successive years of surplus.
"On the field, we secured our first piece of silverware in nearly 20 years, and only the club's fifth-ever trophy, when we won the County Championship Division Two title in 2012.
"The on-field re-organisation and recruitment this winter under Kim Barnett's guidance should also ensure a far more competitive season on the pitch in 2017 and beyond."
The club have also revealed that former Derbyshire, Nottinghamshire and England fast bowler Mike Hendrick, in the role of cricket advisory director, is one of six nominees to join the county's supervisory board.
Derbyshire came bottom of Division Two in the County Championship last summer, while finishing seventh in their group in both the One-Day Cup and T20 Blast.

"Derbyshire supporters probably thought things would calm down this year following a shocking 2016.
"A new coaching structure - headed by Derbyshire legend Kim Barnett - and the exciting prospect of Imran Tahir as their overseas player point to an improvement, so the fans will be hoping that chairman Chris Grant's departure will not rock the boat too much.
"Despite the work that has gone into the ground during his time at the helm - and the County Ground is a fine stadium now - he came in for his share of criticism for the way things were going on the field.
"Grant is a larger than life character with strong opinions on many things - not just cricket. It will certainly be a lot quieter on the county circuit with him no longer on the scene."
