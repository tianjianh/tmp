Premier League predictions: Lawro v singer Amy Macdonald

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
BBC Sport's football expert Mark Lawrenson is pitting his wits against a different guest each week this season.

Lawro's opponent for this weekend's Premier League fixtures is singer-songwriter Amy Macdonald.
Macdonald has been a fan of Scottish Premiership side Rangers since she went to watch them for the first time, aged 10.
"It was Walter Smith's testimonial match at Ibrox against Liverpool in 1998," she told BBC Sport. "Rangers won 1-0 and from that moment I was pretty hooked.
"I was a bit of a tomboy at school. I loved to sit with the boys and discuss football and I was always a bit of a statto - I knew everything that was going on with every team.
"Growing up in Glasgow, it is such a massive footballing city that it is hard not to be involved in that. I don't know anybody who is not interested in football - everyone has got an opinion."
Macdonald, who is engaged to St Johnstone right-back Richard Foster, has experienced good and bad times as a Rangers supporter, with the club now back in the Scottish top flight after being liquidated and placed in Division Three in 2012.
"It has been a crazy few years," she explained. "When I first became a fan and started to get really into football it was the Dick Advocaat era and at that point there were so many amazing players that were signed.
"There were people like Lorenzo Amoruso, who became cult heroes at Rangers. Someone like him would be my ultimate favourite, but there were so many incredible players in the team that it was an absolute pleasure to be a fan back then.
"Obviously everything that has happened since then has proved that being a football fan is a massive roller-coaster and you have incredible highs and terrible lows, which has happened over the past few years.
"I think a lot of fans were glad when Rangers got back in the top division but I still think there is a long way to go to get the team back to where they were and back to where a lot of the fans expect them to be."
