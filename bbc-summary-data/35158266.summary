Egyptian champions Zamalek have reversed their decision to quit the current Premier League season.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The club announced its original decision on Sunday in protest at the officiating during the 3-2 loss to El-Gaish that evening.
The board met on Monday to discuss possible consequences and announced on Tuesday they would stay in the league.
Had they gone ahead, Zamalek would have been banned from football for a year and relegated to the fourth division.
That would have had significant financial consequences both for them and their sponsors and could have led to the break-up of the squad.
Zamalek were also concerned about the reaction of some of their fans, who have been celebrating their first title in a decade.
Instead of pulling out of the league, Zamalek have written a letter of complaint regarding the officials in the El-Gaish match to the Egyptian Football Association.
Their request for referee Mahmoud Al Banna to be replaced for the match was rejected in the build up to the game.
Al Banna sent off Zamalek defender Ali Gabr after just four minutes and awarded El-Gaish the first of two penalties, the second came 10 minutes into the second half.
