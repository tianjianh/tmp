Juventus 2-0 Chievo

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Gonzalo Higuain scored twice as Juventus beat Chievo to move closer to a sixth consecutive Serie A title.

He converted Paulo Dybala's cut-back from 12 yards out to open the scoring after good wing play by his Argentina team-mate.
And he added a second, his 27th goal of the season, after the break from Stephan Lichtsteiner's cross, with Dybala involved in the build-up.
Juve are nine points above Roma, who visit Bologna on Sunday.
They have won 32 home games in a row in Serie A, a run going back to September 2015.
