A dramatic injury-time equaliser from teenage substitute Kyle Wootton gifted Scunthorpe a point against relegation rivals Port Vale.

Richard Duffy fired Vale in front after Neil Collins headed down a corner for the defender to coolly latch onto.
Scunthorpe's Paddy Madden could have levelled later on but fired the ball over the crossbar from close range.
But Wootton's late goal rescued a point and prevented the visitors from taking their first win in eight games.
The Iron remain in 17th, a point above 18th-placed Vale who are three points above the League One relegation zone.
Scunthorpe manager Mark Robins told BBC Radio Humberside:

"We were by no means at our best tonight but we've created enough chances to win the game.
"We gave them one shot at goal and they scored.
"The changes we made had an impact no doubt about that - I told Kyle (Wooten) to go make a name for himself which he has thankfully gone and done."
