[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
It confirmed Channings Wood governor Gavin O'Malley had been moved to another role at a different jail.
Officials said the move was not connected to a vote of no confidence passed against the governor and his deputy by the Prison Officers' Association (POA).
The POA said it had concerns about staffing levels and assaults at the jail.
The category C prison, near Newton Abbot, holds about 730 inmates.
John Hancock, from the POA, said members were "totally burnt out".
He said: "It's not just [prisoner] protests, violence and assaults against staff have hugely increased and there are assaults on other inmates as well.
"It's becoming so dangerous that staff have concerns about how prisons and Channings Wood are being run."
The Ministry of Justice said: "Channings Wood continues to be a safe and decent prison.
"In its most recent inspection it was described as safe and calm with low levels of violence."
