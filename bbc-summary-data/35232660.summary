The nephew of Pat Dorrian, the mother of missing County Down woman Lisa Dorrian, has told mourners that her daughter's disappearance "cast a shadow" over the rest of her life.

The funeral service for Mrs Dorrian, 59, took place at St Comgall's Catholic church in Bangor on Tuesday.
Lisa Dorrian was last seen at a party at a caravan site in Ballyhalbert on 28 February 2005.
Despite land and sea searches, her body has never been found.
Rev Adrian Dorrian, a Church of Ireland minister, delivered the eulogy at his aunt's funeral.
He said his aunt, who died last week, was a "devoted family woman" and the loss of her daughter "took an unbearable toll".
"While the day-to-day of life went on, the reality of having had her daughter taken from her so brutally would weigh on her (as on all of Lisa's family) and the pain of a heartbroken mother would be hers from that day on," he added.
"That is not to say there were no moments of celebration, no family events at which Pat with the rest of us could not count blessings, but the injustice of Lisa's disappearance would cast a shadow over the rest of her mother's life.
"Recent media coverage has spoken of the wish Pat shared with her family that one day they might have the opportunity to give Lisa a proper Christian burial.
"That may not be a wish Pat would see fulfilled in this life, but it is one that can still be fulfilled for her family."
He said those with information about Lisa Dorrian's disappearance should come forward.
Police have previously made several arrests, but no-one has been charged with the 25-year-old Bangor woman's murder.
Last year, Mrs Dorrian joined other family members on the tenth anniversary of her daughter's disappearance to appeal to those who knew where her body was hidden to end their anguish.
