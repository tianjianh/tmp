The 6m (19.6 ft) structure would be located on the Pentagon roundabout and greet motorists as they enter the city.
Derbyshire County Cricket Club (DCCC) chief executive Simon Storey said the stumps would be paid for by local firms and private donors.
It has until May to submit its 2017 tournament bid.
Mr Storey said the structure would signal the city's commitment to a successful tournament and building a "long-lasting" cricket legacy to the bidding panel.
He said that a total of Â£3.4m would be invested in improving the club's 3aaa County Ground before 2017.
The work would be funded by grants from the England and Wales Cricket Board and Derby Enterprise Growth Fund, as well as loan funding from the city council, he said.
Council leader Ranjit Banwait said the world cup was "an exciting prospect for the city".
