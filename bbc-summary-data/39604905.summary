[SN]TITLE[SN]
Swindon Town 1-2 Scunthorpe United

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Swindon Town were relegated to League Two after losing at home to Scunthorpe, with Bury's victory condemning the Robins to the drop.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Iron led early on when home keeper Lawrence Vigouroux dropped a cross, which hit Murray Wallace and went in.
Swindon's fate was effectively sealed as Sam Mantom swept home a second for the visitors from a low ball in.
Rohan Ince netted from range but the Robins, with Tim Sherwood as director of football, could not save themselves.
With just one game remaining Swindon are five points behind 20th-placed Gillingham, while Scunthorpe cannot now be automatically promoted after Bolton's win, meaning Graham Alexander's side will contest the play-offs.

In November, Tim Sherwood was named director of football at the County Ground, a move described as "one of the biggest appointments the club has ever made" by chairman Lee Power.
The former Spurs manager was given responsibility for "transfers, the way we play, the formations and the picking of the team" - though head coach Luke Williams was kept in his post.
Despite an impressive 3-0 win over Charlton in their first game following Sherwood's arrival, the appointment did not result in a sustained improvement in form, as Swindon have won only seven of their 31 games since his hiring.
At times, it was unclear whether or not Sherwood was managing the team, though in recent weeks his first-team responsibilities have decreased, and he has not attended all of the Robins' games.
But the return to a more conventional coaching structure has not paid dividends, as a four-game winless run sent them down to the fourth tier for the first time since 2012.
