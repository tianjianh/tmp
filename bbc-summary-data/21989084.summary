[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Police have not named the victim, found near the A16 at Newborough on Saturday morning, but said they were treating his death as murder.
He had not been seen since Friday. His Ford Mondeo had been found burnt out near a farm in Yaxley at 21:00 GMT and he was reported missing at 22:40 GMT.
Det Ch Insp Martin Brunning said officers were treating the man's death as an "isolated incident".
"I would appeal to anyone who was in the area of Newborough yesterday morning or who may have seen the Mondeo estate being driven in the Yaxley area on Good Friday to call police," he added.
"We are in contact with the man's family and will be keeping them up to date on our investigation."
