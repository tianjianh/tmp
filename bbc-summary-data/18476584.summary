[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An offshore wind farm off the Cumbrian coast, described as the largest in the world, has become fully operational.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 102-turbine farm, off Walney Island, was developed by Danish energy company Dong Energy.
It created 60 jobs at the firm's operations centre in Barrow.
It was built in two phases with the second set of 51 turbines completed in six months - a record for the wind farm sector.
Benj Sykes, from Dong Energy, said: "Walney is the first project in the UK to be backed by institutional investors before it was built, a confidence justified by the speed and efficiency of the construction."
