[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Nigel Day was last seen at his home in Portland Road, Wyke Regis, on Tuesday.
On Thursday, police and the coastguard helicopter searched for him around the coast of Portland when a bag of belongings were found on Chesil Beach.
Officers believe Nigel entered the water and came to harm.
He is described as white, of thin build, and around six foot tall with shoulder-length hair and a beard.
He made phone contact with a relative on Wednesday but no one has seen or heard from him since.
Sgt Jeremy Cuff, of Weymouth Police, said: "It has been five days since Nigel was last in contact and, following the discovery of his clothing and other items on Chesil beach, we are extremely concerned for his welfare."
Dorset Police is appealing for information.
