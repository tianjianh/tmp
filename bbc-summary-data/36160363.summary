Brighton & Hove Albion defender Liam Rosenior has urged his team-mates to relish the climax of the Championship's automatic promotion race.

The Seagulls are one of three teams level on 87 points heading in to the last two games of the season, with the top two promoted to the Premier League.
"This is what you work so hard for," the 31-year-old told BBC Sussex.
"You have got to make sure you enjoy it and relish the opportunity in front of you rather than shy away from it."
Brighton currently sit behind league leaders Burnley and Middlesbrough on goal difference, but the Sussex side know they will be promoted if they win their last two fixtures, because they travel to Boro on the final day.
All three sides have been in good form recently, with the Clarets on a 21-match unbeaten run, Middlesbrough winning six of their last eight and Albion seven of their last eight.
"All credit to Burnley and Middlesbrough - we seem to be bringing the best out of each other," said Rosenior. "We keep challenging each other to go and perform and all three teams have been magnificent.
"It makes for a fantastic end of the season."
Rosenior, who joined Brighton last summer, has experience of going straight up from the Championship, having finished second with previous club Hull in 2012-13.
"Being promoted with Hull was an experience I will never forget," he said. "I want to create more memories here and we are close to doing it.
"It sounds simple but we have to show no fear. As soon as you start thinking 'this game is worth Â£180m to the club' you are not going to play well."
