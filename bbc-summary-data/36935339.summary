Carter, playing in his first major final since being given the all-clear from lung cancer in 2014, beat his fellow Englishman 10-8 in Yushan.
The 37-year-old won four frames in a row to lead 6-3 at the halfway stage.
And although Perry took the match to the penultimate frame, Carter edged home to claim a victory that moves him back into the world's top 16.
"I have been through a lot over the last couple of years so to get back into the top 16 is a huge achievement," said Carter.
Prior to being diagnosed with a tumour on his lung, Carter was given the all-clear after testicular cancer. He has also lived with Crohn's disease for a number of years.
The Essex player returned to the professional circuit late in 2014 and won the minor-ranking Paul Hunter Classic last year.
"I'm delighted - there was so much riding on today, winning a ranking event as well as my top-16 place," the two-time World Championship runner-up added.
"I have been focused all week and to come out the winner is very special. It has been a great week for me."
