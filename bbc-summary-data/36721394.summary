Talks break up again in ScotRail dispute

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Talks aimed at resolving the ScotRail dispute have broken up, without any progress being made.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The RMT union met Abellio ScotRail management for an hour over its plans to change staffing levels on new trains.
The two parties held talks twice last week, brokered through the Arbitration and Conciliation Advisory Service (ACAS).
On both occasions, they broke up for both sides to consider their positions.
Members of the RMT have already staged a number of walkouts in the dispute, and further stoppages are scheduled. They include three of the four competition days at golf's Open Championship, which is being played at Royal Troon next week.
The RMT also intends to strike on Sunday 10 and Monday 11 July.
The dispute relates to driver-only-operation (DOO) trains, where the driver is asked to close the doors at stations, instead of the conductor.
The RMT union claims the move poses a risk but ScotRail says it would always schedule a second person on trains.
