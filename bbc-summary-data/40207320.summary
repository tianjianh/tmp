The Coastguard said they had received a call at about 13:45 from a member of the public who was concerned about the kayakers.
The two men - who were both in the same kayak - were making their way from Fisherrow Nest to Musselburgh.
Following a search, the men were winched into a helicopter and taken to hospital.
A spokesman for the Coastguard said they appeared to be suffering from mild hypothermia. Their condition is not thought to be life-threatening.
Before their rescue, the men were last spotted at about 14:45 north-west of Fisherrow and drifting towards Joppa.
South Queensferry, Fisherrow and North Berwick Coastguard rescue teams and the Coastguard search and rescue helicopter based at Prestwick were sent to the scene.
Kaimes Beasley, from HM Coastguard, said: "This was a very swift water rescue and, given the conditions at sea today, these two men are extremely lucky.
"We are grateful to the member of the public who called us to report this incident - they did exactly the right thing when they saw the weather conditions were poor.
"This incident shows you how important it is to be prepared for your water activity, and have several means of contacting the Coastguard or raising an alarm, if you're heading out to sea."
