The New Year's Eve fireworks display in London will continue to be a ticketed event, Mayor Sadiq Khan has said.

Tickets, which will go on sale at 12:00 BST on 21 October, will be priced at Â£10 - the same as last year.
Until 2014, the event was free but Mr Khan's predecessor Boris Johnson introduced a ticketing system to limit crowds which gather along the Thames.
At the time Mr Khan, then shadow London minister, claimed the change had been "driven by cuts not safety".
City Hall said the mayor had "personally scrutinised" the plans and has followed the advice of the Metropolitan Police, Transport for London, and local councils to retain the ticketing system.
About 110,000 revellers are expected to gather in the viewing areas for the popular show, which is focused around the London Eye.
Mr Khan said: "London is the best place in the world to see in the new year and every year thousands of people watch the spectacular fireworks display on the banks of the Thames.
"My number one priority is the safety of Londoners and visitors to the capital, and I want everyone to be able to enjoy this fantastic event in a way that is fun and secure."
