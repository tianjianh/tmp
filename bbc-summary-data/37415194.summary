[SN]TITLE[SN]
Barnet 2-2 Morecambe

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Morecambe twice came from behind to draw with Barnet, despite a John Akinde double at The Hive.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Shrimps forward Paul Mullin hit the post in the opening exchanges but it was the home side who took the lead.
Akinde latched onto Michael Nelson's long pass and chipped the ball over goalkeeper Barry Roche for his sixth of the season.
But Morecambe were level almost immediately, Tom Barkhuizen following in to nod his equaliser home after seeing the ball hit the post.
The visitors hit the woodwork twice more but the Bees retook the lead with another neat Akinde finish, converting Nicholls' clever pass.
The striker almost completed his hat-trick 10 minutes after the break, only for Roche to produce a brilliant one-handed save from point-blank range.
And Morecambe eventually claimed their second equaliser of the night when Cole Stockton turned in James Jennings' cross, the only real chance Jim Bentley's side created after half-time.
