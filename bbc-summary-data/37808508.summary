[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Dunfermline Athletic kept only their second clean sheet in the league this season as they drew with Fife rivals Raith Rovers at East End Park.

But the Pars still slumped to second bottom place in the Championship.
Allan Johnston's side have only managed two wins so far, against St Mirren and Dumbarton, which explains the position.
But they really should have taken full points from a fiercely contested Fife derby as they were the more impressive side going forward.
They certainly created the better of the few chances in a frantic first half lacking in composed football, but Farid El Alagui squandered the best of them in 39 minutes.
Joe Cardle danced clear of two challenges in a central area before sliding a pass that left the former Hibs striker with only Kevin Cuthbert to beat, but the Rovers goalkeeper blocked the parting shot.
Prior to that, strike partner Nicky Clark sliced a shot wide from the edge of the penalty area and, just before the interval, Cardle fired a drive past from 20 yards against a side lacking cohesion from middle to front.
In fact it took a spectacular diving headed clearance by Iain Davidson from underneath his own crossbar to prevent Kallum Higginbotham's driven cross from finding the net in 56 minutes.
It took an hour for the Kirkcaldy side to create a decent chance of their own after Mark Stewart broke clear on the right, but Ross Callachan was unable to convert the pullback from six yards.
The Rovers midfielder shot wide of the goal with 15 minutes left after goalkeeper Sean Murdoch made a mistake when coming off his line in an attempt to clear.
Overall, it was a typical derby clash and Rovers manager Gary Locke will be happy with the determination and commitment his players showed, especially the well-organised defence.
He will be concerned about the lack of quality link-up play from middle to front, while his Dunfermline counterpart will feel that, if they can strike the right balance between attack and defence, things can turn for them.
Dunfermline Athletic manager Allan Johnston: "It was the same at Dumbarton last week as we probably deserved the win but came away with just a point.
"The positive thing is we defended a lot better and looked solid, but you have to give Raith Rovers credit for the way they defended.
"Especially when Iain Davidson cleared from under his own bar in the second half as I don't know how he got that out.
"You can see the quality we have got in some of our play and if we keep producing that then we will get more wins."
Raith Rovers manager Gary Locke: "It was 100 miles an hour at times and the first half in particular was hectic. We created chances in the second half.
"Over the piece, a draw is a fair result and Iain Davidson shows what the boys are all about as he's not a right back, but he's been outstanding there for the team.
"Kevin McHattie also showed the character we are looking for as he got injured in the first half, but for us to be successful we need boys to put their bodies on the line and he did.
"He got a deadleg early in the match, but he carried on for the full 90 minutes showing real determination, which is what we need."
