Leeds United head coach Garry Monk insisted his side were unlucky not to beat Liverpool in their EFL Cup quarter-final at Anfield.

The Reds defeated the Championship side 2-0 to progress to the last four.
"The result feels a bit unfair to be honest. I thought we looked excellent on the break and we had the best chances," Monk told BBC Radio Leeds.
"I think what was missing was that bit of composure and luck. I can't have any complaints apart from the result."
The former Swansea boss continued: "I told the players that I was gutted for them.
"We want to try and make this a regular fixture and if we can keep focused on what we're doing then hopefully we can be successful."
Leeds forward Kemar Roofe hit the inside of the post before Liverpool opened the scoring through Divock Origi.
Roofe, 23, who is yet to register his first goal for the club since his Â£3m summer move from Oxford, felt they could have gone on to win if they had scored first.
"I think we'd have built some momentum and it would have given us some positivity to keep going, but it wasn't to be," he said.
"We're growing every game and getting used to each other and I think we showed today that our confidence is building."
