[SN]TITLE[SN]
North Wales Police officer admits online child sex offence

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A North Wales Police officer has admitted trying to arrange a child sex offence over the internet.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
James Calveley Evans, 33, from Maes Pennant, Mostyn, Flintshire, appeared at Mold Crown Court on Friday.
He also pleaded guilty to three charges of distributing child sex images and three charges of possessing child sex images.
He has been further remanded in custody pending a pre-sentence report and will be sentenced in September.
Evans, who has been suspended as a North Wales Police constable, thought he was corresponding with a child by email, but it was an undercover police officer.
He admitted to the court he had attempted to arrange or facilitate a child sex offence in February.
But he denied a second similar offence in March, which the prosecution had agreed to lie on file.
Evans was also found to be downloading and distributing child sex abuse images and was found to have 607 photographs and 16 video images.
Judge Rhys Rowlands told him custody was inevitable and that it would "simply be a matter of the length of the sentence".
