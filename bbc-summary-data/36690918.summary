In a thrilling finish, the Brazilian duo held off New Zealand's Alex Maloney and Molly Meech, who had to settle for silver, while Denmark's Jeva Hansen and Katja Salskov-Iversen won bronze.
Great Britain's Charlotte Dobson and Sophie Ainsworth had a race to forget.
They hit the committee boat at the start and had to serve a penalty, then capsized to finish eighth overall.
Hosts Brazil have won four gold medals at the 2016 Olympics, their second-highest total at a single Games.
Their highest tally at a single Olympics was the five they collected in Athens in 2004.
Scottish sailor Dobson said: "Some days are really good and others don't play to your strength and there's a big difference between those days.
"Today was a bad day for us but we'll be back on it the next time.
"The Olympics has been a magical experience from start to finish - way more than I expected it to be.
"It's been amazing to be part of such a strong, supportive GB team and it's been really nice to relish in their success. Hopefully one day that might be us."
