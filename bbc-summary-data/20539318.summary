The artwork was made by an anonymous artist as part of Book Week Scotland. Other pieces have been hidden at locations across Scotland.
Pupils at Eriskay Primary School followed clues before finding the sculpture.
Whisky Galore was inspired by the grounding of a ship carrying whisky.
The SS Politician, which was carrying more than 250,000 bottles of the spirit, got into difficulty off Eriskay on 5 February 1941.
The cargo ship was headed for Jamaica when it ran aground on the northern side of the island in bad weather.
Clues to finding the Book Week Scotland sculptures are posted online.
Eriskay school teacher Katy MacDonald said: "The pupils and I have had great fun following the mysterious trail, which led us to a beautiful Whisky Galore-inspired sculpture - a story we all know and love."
The treasure hunt took the children to Eriskay ferry terminal, the village store before finding it at the Am Politician Lounge Bar.
They celebrated by singing two Gaelic songs for everyone gathered.
