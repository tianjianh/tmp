Police are investigating whether the incident is linked to the "unexplained" death of a woman nearby.
Emergency services were called to a report of a fire at Peacockbank Farm in Stewarton at about 05:15 on Thursday.
A 50-year-old man was found badly injured nearby and taken to Crosshouse Hospital, where he remains in a serious condition. Soon after, a woman's body was found at a house in the town.
Police Scotland said the discovery of the woman's body at Crusader Crescent at 06:20 was being treated as "unexplained".
Asked if the two cases are thought to be linked, a force spokeswoman said: "This is one line of inquiry, however, we cannot confirm at this time."
She added: "A joint investigation between Police Scotland and the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service is under way to establish the cause of the fire.
"The woman is still to be formally identified and her death is being treated as unexplained.
"A post-mortem examination into the cause of death will be held in due course."
