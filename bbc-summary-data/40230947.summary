[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Starting on 153-6, the visitors added just 23 more runs to trail by 42 as Ben Sanderson finished with 5-52.
Max Holden and Newton (108) made 92 for the first wicket, and Newton added 133 alongside Alex Wakely (79).
Tony Palladino removed Holden and Newton for the visitors, before another McKerr wicket left it 247-4 at stumps.
Derbyshire were a man light with Luis Reece spending Friday night in hospital after complaining of breathing difficulties on day one, but the club say he is "feeling much better in himself".
Newton, who has also scored four half-centuries this season, recorded the 12th first-class ton of his career to help his side to a healthy 289-run advantage.
