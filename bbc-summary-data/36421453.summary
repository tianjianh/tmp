The North Ledaig Co Ltd, which bought the marina after its previous owners went into administration in 2011, is looking for offers over £975,000.
It said it had made "strenuous efforts" to improve the infrastructure on which the marina relied but with only partial success.
The marina is located on the Isle of Kerrera, close to Oban.
It includes 95 serviced floating pontoon berths, 30 moorings, two boatsheds, as well as a shop, bar and licensed restaurant.
Oban Marina's managing director, Peter Weir, told BBC Scotland that the company had tried to improve infrastructure around the island, including wi-fi and water supplies, but had had limited success.
He said: "We have struggled. We had high hopes when we bought the marina. We were prepared to invest £1m into this place to make it a showpiece for Oban but that didn't happen because of the issues we faced.
"We have invested £250,000 but I am 72 now and I just feel that I am past running it."
He added: "It is one of the most fabulous locations on the west coast.
"It has traded successfully in the past and we are three-quarters of the way to solving the infrastructure issues.
"A younger, more enthusiastic buyer should be able to turn it around and hopefully develop it into the marina it has been in the past and grow it into a showpiece for Oban."
Estate agent Strutt & Parker is handling the sale.
Associate Euan MacCrimmon said: "The sale of Oban Marina offers a rare opportunity to purchase a trading marina located within an area which boasts some of the best sailing in Europe.
"It benefits from several income streams and development opportunities. It is not often a business like this comes to the market and it offers fantastic potential."
