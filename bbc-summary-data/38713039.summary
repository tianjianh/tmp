Heart of Midlothian 4-2 Raith Rovers

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Hearts set up a Scottish Cup fifth-round derby against Hibernian after overcoming Raith Rovers in extra time.

Bobby Barr's deflected shot deservedly put the Championship side ahead but teenage striker Rory Currie, on his first start, levelled before half-time.
Both sides wasted chances to win it in normal time before Malaury Martin's penalty put Hearts ahead.
Ryan Hardie equalised but another penalty, from Jamie Walker, made it 3-2 before Conor Sammon sealed victory.
It was only a second win in seven games for Hearts under new head coach Ian Cathro, but they can now look forward to hosting Edinburgh rivals Hibs at Tynecastle on the weekend of 11/12 February.
Rovers, seventh in the Championship, certainly didn't start the game like a team who had not won any of their last 10 matches since the end of October.
Within the opening five minutes both Kyle Benedictus and Declan McManus had forced Jack Hamilton into saves.
And the pressure paid off in spectacular style when Barr drove forward and his shot from 25 yards took a deflection beyond Hamilton and into the net.
Cathro again started the match with four of his new January signings in the side.
But it was 18-year-old Currie, making his first start for the club, who drew Hearts level 10 minutes before half time.
Slack Rovers play in midfield allowed Bjorn Johnsen to drive forward and slip the ball through to the teenager, who showed great composure in drilling the ball beyond Kevin Cuthbert in the Raith goal.
Walker has been Hearts' most influential player this season and again he come to the rescue of his side here.
The winger could easily have been awarded a penalty in the second half after a challenge by Rovers substitute Jason Thomson, but referee John Beaton waived away the demands of the Tynecastle faithful.
Just two minutes into extra time though, Beaton had no doubts as Walker tumbled to the ground after a clash with Kyle Benedictus.
With Walker receiving treatment, Frenchman Martin took responsibility and sent Cuthbert the wrong way as the hosts took the lead for the first time.
Rovers were visibly tiring but to their enormous credit continued to push forward and were rewarded with an equaliser.
A shocking mistake by John Souttar gave Mark Stewart time to play in Hardie, who clipped the ball home and drew the Kirkcaldy club level.
But Walker again used his pace and skill to draw another challenge inside the box from Benedictus.
This time the 23-year-old winger picked himself up and although Cuthbert got a hand to the ball, it ended up in the back of the net.
The outcome was finally settled when Johnsen knocked the ball home from close range to send Hearts through.
Hearts head coach Ian Cathro: "Raith deserve a lot of credit for pushing us and keeping the game alive all the way.  We couldn't quite kill it off.
"It was a massive test of character for all of us and we have passed it.  Ultimately we had to get through to the next round of the Cup and we did.
"Historically this club brings through young talent and at one point, Rory Currie was one of six players who have come through the academy on the pitch.  That is something we will always do when the players show they are ready.
"[Playing Hibs] is a perfect opportunity for us.  We look forward to it immediately."
Raith boss Gary Locke: "I couldn't be prouder of the way we played. I thought the players were fantastic.
"I am just deeply disappointed for them.  They put so much into the game, so to come away with nothing is a sore one to take.
"We felt we could win the game and I thought we showed that.  But unfortunately we were on the end of two big [penalty] decisions.  From where I was, the first one looked very soft.
"But if we can emulate that performance in the league, we will get back to winning ways.  Over the two games we have matched a top Premiership club, which speaks volumes about the quality we have got."
