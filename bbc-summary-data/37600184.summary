Scotland 1-1 Lithuania: Not a 'Georgia moment', insists Robert Snodgrass

Scotland midfielder Robert Snodgrass does not believe Saturday's draw with Lithuania will prove to be a 'Georgia moment' in World Cup qualifying.

Defeat in Tbilisi last September was generally regarded as the most damaging result of the Euro 2016 qualifiers.
"There will be many twists and turns," Snodgrass said after the Hampden draw.
"Obviously you want to be winning your first home game. But, in the end, it is a point that might be vital. Hopefully it is a good point."
Scotland had fallen behind to Fedor Cernych's fine strike 14 minutes into the second half at Hampden.
But Gordon Strachan's side eventually pulled level with a minute of normal time remaining through a James McArthur header.
Snodgrass, 29, thought the Scots missed an opportunity to take more points against Lithuania.
"They got it down and tried to play a bit, but every time we put pressure on them, I felt they gave us the ball," said the Hull City player.
"Let's be honest, they had two chances and took one of them, so fair play to them.
"The second half, they had their backs to the wall a little bit and we had chance after chance.
"We eventually got the goal and I thought we were going to go on and win it, but it wasn't to be."
Fellow midfielder Barry Bannan also preferred to take the positives from the match ahead of Tuesday's trip to face Slovakia, who were beaten 1-0 in Slovenia.
"We set out to win the game and we're disappointed, but in the last 10 minutes, we were 1-0 down, so it could be a huge point at the end of this group," said the Sheffield Wednesday player, 26.
"Lithuania showed they are going to take points off people in this group.
"They stopped us from playing. I think they pressed high up, which we didn't expect.
"Slovakia have lost again, so if we can go there and get a point or three points then it's been a good two games for us."
James Forrest, a second-half substitute for Oliver Burke, thought the Scots could take confidence from the way they salvaged a point.
"We've only played two games, we've got four points and we just need to build on that," said the 25-year-old Celtic winger.
"There's still a long way to go and there are a few upsets in this group to come."
