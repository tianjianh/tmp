Papers shine a spotlight on China-Africa ties as Premier Li Keqiang visits the continent.

Mr Li reached Ethiopia on Sunday in the first leg of his week-long tour. He will also visit Nigeria, Angola and Kenya.
The premier promised Ethiopia that China would help the country to construct more power plants and roads. Both countries also signed agreements in other sectors such as agriculture and industrialisation, reports say.
Papers appear to be trying hard to reject what they call the "West's propaganda" that "China is colonising Africa".
"China has a tradition of being kind to Africa," an article in the Beijing Times comments.
"China will not colonise Africa like Western countries did before and is not interested in the so-called neo-colonialism. China only wants to provide aid to Africa and help in its development. We take from Africa, but we don't forget to give backâ€¦ We urge other Western nations to treat Africa well," it adds.
However, the Global Times' Chinese edition points out that some Chinese businessmen in Africa are "not too concerned with their country's image".
"China needs to build a positive image in local communities of different African countries, and all Chinese nationals working in the continent need to play a part in it," it urges.
The paper adds that "more official visits of different levels are needed. We should also support more state-owned enterprises and companies with good reputations to go there."
Meanwhile, President Xi Jinping urged the country's youth to "improve their moral character" in his lecture to mark China's Youth Day on Sunday.
The president interacted with students at Peking University in Beijing after giving his lecture.
"Don't dream of getting rich if you want to be a government official," he said.
Media outlets seem to be backing Mr Xi's call. "By saying this, Mr Xi is telling all the young people in the country that they have to cultivate sound values and maintain a right attitude," the Changjiang Net, a news portal of the Hubei provincial government, says.
The website adds that those planning to become government officials must listen to the president.
"This is also a warning to present officials as well to those who wish to become leaders of the party in the future. The aspirants are wrong if they think that they can become rich by being in the government. In other words, one should not think that being rich is the ultimate reason to become a government official," it says.
And finally, 11 Uighur students have written an open letter condemning the bomb attack at Urumqi's south railway station on Wednesday. China says Uighur separatists were behind the attack.
The authorities believe two of the attackers, who were among the dead, had come under the influence of "extremist religious thought and participated in extremist religious activities".
The letter, entitled "We will no longer remain silent", was posted online on 1 May and has been widely shared on websites.
"We urge our compatriots to denounce religious extremismâ€¦ We urge our countrymen in China and overseas to see clearly what tragedies such hostility has causedâ€¦," the students appealed in the letter.
