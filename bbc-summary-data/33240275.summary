A huge sinkhole has appeared on the 13th hole of a golf course in Texas, America.

Experts say the sinkhole opened up after heavy rain put pressure on the surface of the course.
Parts of the course are made over an old limestone mine and the hole opened up over a cave.
Unsurprisingly the area is now out of bounds until it can be repaired.
It's certainly one hole golfers shouldn't be able to miss!
