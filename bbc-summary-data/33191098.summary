Tesco Weston Favell reduced food scrum part of a trend

A video of supermarket customers forming a scrum around a discount food aisle in Tesco has been watched by almost 2.5 million people. What's making people lose their heads over bargain offers - and who is responsible?

The footage shows customers clutching shopping baskets at Tesco's Weston Favell store being told to "sit" like dogs before they were let loose on cut price meat.
Facebook user Johnny Lester, who recorded the video, said he was "shocked and in disbelief".
A Tesco spokesman told the BBC the store manager "will take steps to prevent a similar situation happening again".
But shoppers scrapping over discount goods seems to be becoming more commonplace, if recent years are anything to go by.
When people were seen fighting over reduced price televisions and other consumer goods during "Black Friday" last year, three MPs tabled a Commons motion criticising the discount sales day.
Police were called to supermarkets across the UK and Greater Manchester Police appealed for calm after attending seven Tesco shops, at which three men were arrested.
The force's chief constable, Sir Peter Fahy, wrote on Twitter that it was "very disappointing that major stores did not learn lessons from last year".
A search on YouTube found a number of instances of similar behaviour had been recorded and posted at Tesco stores throughout the country over the past two years.
One, captured at an unnamed store in August 2013, shows a group of shoppers charging stacks of discounted cakes, pushing a trolley across the supermarket.
Another shows shoppers in Broadstairs battling to grab reduced fruit and veg, while in yet another video a staff member has to ask onrushing customers to let him out before they race for discounted salad in the store in Huddersfield Road, Oldham.
YouTube user Mark Stebles posted his video of people scrumming at the reduced counter at the Sidcup store on 23 April.
He said: "It is quite a regular thing. People were doing it again last night.
"It seems a bit more popular these days - people know what time it happens."
And a video by Harry Morton, posted in June last year, shows a young boy standing in a supermarket trolley looking on as shoppers scramble to grab bargains.
Mr Morton said: "It is a problem that is growing quickly."
Several other videos on the movie sharing website show similar scenes.
The BBC has opted not to link to these videos in the interests of the shoppers' privacy, but they have all been sent to Tesco.
Videos have also been produced by bargain hunting experts advising people to take advantage of such sales.
Former Northampton North MP and Green party member Tony Clarke said Tesco needed to act more responsibly.
He said: "They are putting their staff at risk and allowing customers to wrestle on their knees in the hunt for a bargain.
"It is not for me to comment on the social position of those involved. Some may have been very needy, some may just have been looking for a bargain.
"But it is pretty demeaning to see people driven to such base levels in a supermarket."
Behavioural specialist Lorrine Marer said there were many reasons why people acted in such a way, including genuine poverty, a market place mentality among some cultures and the desire to grab a bargain.
She said she worked with looters after the 2011 riots who told her stories about mothers ordering their sons to put 42 inch TVs back and change them for 52 inch ones.
"Certain stores are known to reduce stuff at certain times," she said. "You can see people hovering. As soon as that stuff goes out they are there like locusts.
"I am always interested to follow them home and see where they live. Do they live in a 10-bed home, but just love a bargain?
"There is something in human beings which if they can get it cheaper they will go for it no matter how much money they have.
"It is in our DNA."
Mr Clarke said Tesco should look again at the way it reduced items, saying it should take place throughout the day or via a ticket system.
"I am worried about the way we are going as a society, but it is important the stores act first," he said.
"We could try to second guess what the background of each of these individuals is. Rather than do that, I am asking who is really responsible?"
When the BBC asked Tesco to comment it re-issued the same statement it had given out after the Weston Favell incident.
In it a spokesman said: "The safety of our customers and colleagues is of paramount importance to us.
"The manager of the store has conducted a thorough investigation and will take steps to prevent a similar situation happening again.
"We are continually trying to improve the way we deal with surplus food, this includes making better reductions earlier in the day to make it easier for customers and colleagues in the evening."
