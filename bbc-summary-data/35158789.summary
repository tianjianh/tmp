The brief hearing was told Mr Baker died at 09:39 GMT on 11 December of a single gunshot wound.
He was shot during a police operation to foil an alleged attempt to spring two convicts from a custody van on its way to Wood Green Crown Court.
The firearms officer involved has not been named publicly but has asked the court to consider holding a second post-mortem examination on Wednesday.
Mr Baker's girlfriend Tia Demetrio and other members of his family were present at the inquest opening and the coroner expressed his "deepest sympathies" to the family, BBC home affairs correspondent Danny Shaw reports.
An investigation into the fatal shooting by the police watchdog, the Independent Police Complaints Commission, is ongoing.
