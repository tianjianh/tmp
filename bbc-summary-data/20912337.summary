[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
It is believed Jason McGovern, 19, of Tydavnet, was punched at a pub on John Street on Sunday.
He was hit a short time later at Cunningham Terrace car park and later died.
Detectives from the PSNI's Serious Crime branch arrested a 21-year-old man on Friday.
A 19-year-old man from the Omagh area was arrested on Thursday evening.  Hours earlier, police detained a 17-year-old boy from town.
Two others were arrested on Wednesday.
The men, aged 18 and 21, were also detained in Omagh and the teenager is still being questioned.
The 21-year-old arrested on Wednesday has since been released on bail.
After being attacked, Mr McGovern made his way to a friend's house in Mullan village near Emyvale in County Monaghan where he was found dead on Monday.
The investigation is being led by the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) and supported by the Garda Siochana.
A post mortem examination showed the teenager's death had been due to a head injury he suffered during the initial assault.
