Summerfield made 34 appearances in League Two last season, but left the Minstermen in May after he turned down a new deal following their relegation.
The 28-year-old joined York in 2014 after two seasons with Shrewsbury.
"I only hear positive things about the club and meeting everyone here has made the decision very easy," he said.
