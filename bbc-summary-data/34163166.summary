Police were called to a disturbance at a block of flats on Turnham Road, Brockley, on Thursday and found two 17-year-old boys with stab wounds.
Shaquan Mario Fearon died after arriving in hospital, police said.
Two boys, aged 15 and 16, have been arrested on suspicion of murder and remain in custody.
A post-mortem examination on 4 September gave the cause of Shaquan's death as a stab wound to the leg.
The second victim, who also suffered a stab wound, was taken to hospital and has since been discharged, officers said.
Det Ch Insp Will Reynolds, of the Met's Homicide and Major Crime Command, appealed for any witnesses to come forward.
He said: "Our initial enquiries have established that there were several people in the area at the time Shaquan was attacked."
