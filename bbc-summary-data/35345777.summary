Lancashire Police said children aged "around 11" dropped "a large piece of ice" onto a car on Padiham's Dryden Street at about 20:10 GMT on Saturday.
The next day at about 15:15, four boys "aged about 12 or 13" dropped ice on a car near junction 10 of the M65.
The drivers were "shaken" but not injured, a spokesman said. Police are now seeking those responsible.
Sgt Michael Burnett said it "may have been kids who thought they were simply playing a practical joke, but both incidents could have been so much worse".
He added: "These incidents have put peoples' lives in danger and caused serious damage to their vehicles.
"The drivers are lucky to have escaped unharmed."
