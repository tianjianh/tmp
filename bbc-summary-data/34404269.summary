Alex Hales wants to make England mark in all three formats

Batsman Alex Hales is determined to become an England regular in all three forms of cricket within the next year.

The Nottinghamshire right-hander, 26, has featured regularly in England's Twenty20 and one-day international sides, but is uncapped at Test level.
However, he is in contention to be captain Alastair Cook's opening partner in the forthcoming Test series against Pakistan in the UAE.
"Nailing down a spot in all three forms is my long-term goal," he told the BBC.
"However, that's going to come with a lot of hard work."
England were due to fly to the UAE on Wednesday for a three-Test series which begins in Abu Dhabi on 13 October, following their recent 3-2 Ashes win against Australia.
Hales, who was called up to the Test squad earlier this month, boosted his Test debut chances with a magnificent 189 for Notts against Warwickshire in the County Championship in August.
However, he faces competition for the opening batsman slot from fellow batsman Moeen Ali - who has been England's first-choice spinner for the last year and batted as low as number eight during the Ashes.
Cook's most recent partner Adam Lyth has been dropped after a run of low scores during the Ashes, and while the England skipper has indicated that he knows who will get the nod, he does not believe it is the right time to confirm his decision.
"I've got a fairly good idea," he said.
"I haven't really seen the guys since the end of the Ashes series so it would be slightly wrong to announce it."
