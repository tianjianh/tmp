New Zealand-born Samoa back row Lam, 29, has been with Bristol since 2014.
Former Wasps centre Piutau, 31, who was also born in New Zealand but captained Tonga, signed for Bristol in December.
He initially joined until the end of this term from Yamaha Jubilo of Japan and has made four appearances so far.
"The importance of these two guys staying with us cannot be underestimated," interim head coach Mark Tainton told the club website.
"On their day, both players are some of the most effective in the league in their respective positions and we're delighted that they will remain part of our journey."
