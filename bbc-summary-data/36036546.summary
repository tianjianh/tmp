Although England's James Anderson remained wicketless from his 16 overs, New Zealand left-armer Wagner weighed in with his share after Kyle Jarvis (3-72) had done the the early damage.
From 98-6, captain Chris Read (52) and Stuart Broad (43) helped Notts recover.
Responding to the visitors' 242 all out, Lancashire closed on 25-1.
As well as his 43 from 45 balls, England all-rounder Broad looked lively with the ball too, sending down five overs in tandem with Jake Ball, who was rewarded with the scalp of Karl Brown in only his second over.
Ball earlier performed well with the bat, continuing Notts' recovery by making 33 in an eight-wicket stand of  57 with Read, who had added 74 for the seventh wicket with Broad.
Wagner's figures were the best by a bowler making his Lancashire first-class debut since 1923, had got stuck into the Notts top order.
