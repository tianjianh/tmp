[SN]TITLE[SN]
Conservatives continue running Portsmouth City Council

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Conservatives will continue to run Portsmouth City Council, following a decision at a full council meeting.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Tories are the largest party with 18 out of 42 members.
But they will have to continue as a minority administration after elections earlier this month left the council under no overall control.
They are four short of a majority, a figure which includes the defection of councillor Steve Hastings from UKIP to the Conservatives.
The Liberal Democrats are the second largest party with 15 members. UKIP and Labour have four each while there is one independent.
At the council's annual general meeting, Conservative Donna Jones was reappointed leader unchallenged.
Ms Jones said there had been discussions with both Labour and UKIP ahead of the council meeting, and support from UKIP was enough to ensure a Conservative budget would get voted through.
She said there had been no discussions with the Lib Dems, who ran the council up until 2014, with whom she remains "diametrically opposed".
Ms Jones insisted there was no coalition arrangement with UKIP and she was forming a "a stand-alone Conservative administration with a Conservative-only cabinet".
