The visitors took control of the game inside the opening 20 minutes thanks to tries from Chris Dean, Stefan Marsh and Charly Runciman.
Michael Lawrence got the Giants on the board but Macgraff Leuluai's try reasserted the Vikings' authority.
Marsh got his second and Corey Thompson went in twice, with Larne Patrick and Jamie Foster crossing for the hosts.
It was a great day for the Vikings who had not previously won at Huddersfield since 1996.
Widnes had suffered a home defeat by Salford last time out but got off to a great start at the John Smith's Stadium and never looked like slipping up.
Huddersfield, who are missing seven players through injury, are only off the bottom of Super League on points difference, and lost half-back Jamie Ellis to injury during the game.
Paul Anderson's side next face last placed Leeds Rhinos at Headingley on Friday with both teams looking for their first win of the season, while Widnes host the other winless team in the top flight, Hull KR.
Huddersfield coach Paul Anderson:
"Three quarters of our salary cap have watched today. One or two might have a chance for Friday but we've got to battle on. The key is to stick together.
"I thought Widnes were very good we were poor and pretty soft if I'm honest.
"It was the same team (that almost beat Wigan) but our attitude was not quite right today. If your attitude is not right, you get challenged and Widnes did that. They ran harder than us and they had more vigour in everything they did."
Widnes coach Denis Betts:
"We've not won here for 20 years and it was a great overall performance. There are things in there we can do better - Joe Mellor was finding ways not to score a try.
"The lads are really made up with the fact we've been away from home three times and we've come out with six points from four games. We would have taken that early in the year.
"This next month the games are going to be coming thick and fast and it will be a real test for us. It becomes a war of attrition and the squad gets tested.
