A 22-year-old man who had just announced he was to be a father was crushed to death when a car park barrier smashed on to a windscreen.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
William Page died of chest injuries at an industrial estate in Ilkeston, Derbyshire, in February 2015.
An inquest heard he was driving out of the site when the barrier swung into his van. He had not inserted a pin into the barrier to keep it open.
The jury returned a conclusion of accidental death.
Mr Page, of Stanley Common, a car enthusiast, had spent two hours working on his Peugeot at the site.
Health and Safety Executive engineer Michael Goodwin said: "The barrier is free to swing open quite freely. You are not going to need much in the way of wind loads or someone knocking it to cause it to move."
He added that it was a known problem and the second such incident in 12 months.
The inquest, held in Derby, heard the barrier was already partially open when Mr Page attempted to leave the site.
Speaking after the hearing, his father Brian said: "I just feel sad, he was a lovely lad."
Mr Page had told his family that he was going to be a father the day before the accident.
His partner Rachael Cross, who was nine weeks pregnant at the time, had a scan of their baby buried with him.
