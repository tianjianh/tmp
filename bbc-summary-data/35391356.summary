A baby from Swansea is rediscovering her legs after having them in plaster for half her life due to a hip problem.

After staff at Singleton Hospital noticed an unusual click in seven-month-old Ruby Davies's left hip, she was diagnosed with hip dysplasia.
Ruby, from Treboeth, was put in a plaster cast from her chest to her knees to stretch her legs for more than three months.
The condition affects about one in every 500 children.
Ruby's mother, Tara, was preparing to start IVF treatment when she discovered she was pregnant.
She said dealing with her daughter's condition was a challenge she had not been prepared for.
"It was hard in the beginning. She couldn't wear any of the baby clothes we'd bought and it all had to be put away.
"We had to change her pram because it wasn't suitable and although we had three car seats we ended up having to hire one from a charity for hip dysplasia.
"It was very upsetting because when you find out you're having your first child you don't prepare for things like that."
Ms Davies said Ruby started making the most of her new-found freedom straight away.
She added: "She's finding her legs, managing to roll over on to her belly and back and trying to eat her feet.
"She is coming along well. Nothing is holding her back. There won't be any development delay because of it - they caught it early so hopefully there won't be any long-term effects."
Neil Price, consultant orthopaedic surgeon at Morriston hospital, said hip dysplasia can lead to a limp, hip pain and painful joints in later life if left untreated.
