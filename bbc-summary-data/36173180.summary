[SN]TITLE[SN]
Cardiff Met win Welsh Premier promotion

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Cardiff Metropolitan University have secured promotion from Welsh Football League Division One title to the Welsh Premier League .

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
They won 3-0 at Taffs Well to see off Barry Town United's challenge for promotion.
In the north, Cefn Druids are the only Cymru Alliance side who can go up.
Leaders Caernarfon Town beat them 7-0 on Saturday, but they and second placed Denbigh Town do not have the necessary FAW domestic licences to play in next season's Welsh Premier.
Druids, who are currently third, need a point from their final game at Rhayader Town on Saturday to finish in the top two and earn a return to the top flight.
