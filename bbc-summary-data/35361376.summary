[SN]TITLE[SN]
Lord Janner 'should have been prosecuted 25 years ago'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A senior police officer who interviewed Lord Janner 25 years ago about sex abuse allegations has blamed the Crown Prosecution Service for allowing him to escape justice.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Mick Creedon, now Derbyshire chief constable, said there was enough evidence to prosecute the MP in 1991.
He spoke following publication of an independent inquiry into allegations against Lord Janner.
The late peer's family deny the allegations.
Mr Creedon said: "It remains a simple and regrettable fact that Lord Janner should have been prosecuted 25 years ago.
"This report confirms that the reason he was not [prosecuted] was a direct decision made by the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) and not by Leicestershire Constabulary."
Mr Creedon was a detective sergeant with the Leicestershire force when he became aware of allegations against Lord Janner, who was then MP for Leicester West.
At the time, he was investigating a convicted sex offender called Frank Beck for abuse at children's homes in Leicestershire.
Mr Creedon and his colleague, Det Insp Kelvyn Ashby, interviewed the victim who is referred to in the inquiry report as Complainant 1.
Complainant 1 described being groomed by the MP and having sexual activity with him between the summer of 1974 and December 1975, when he was under 16 years of age and living in a children's home.
Mr Creedon and Det Insp Ashby interviewed the MP under caution on 13 March 1991.
The MP's answer to every question was: "As advised by my solicitor, I do not wish to answer."
But despite this lack of cooperation, police obtained evidence that supported Complainant 1's account, including personal letters sent by Lord Janner.
Mick Creedon's intervention is significant because he's now one of the country's most experienced police chiefs. It matters after all these years, because reputations are at stake.
He's already given preliminary evidence to Justice Lowell Goddard's new Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse. That inquiry's looking for "institutional failings".
Mr Creedon says he wanted to arrest Greville Janner in 1991, but he was ordered to interview the MP by appointment instead.
That meant Greville Janner's home wasn't searched. But Mick Creedon says he "believed the victim's account of abuse".
Sir Richard Henriques, the retired High Court judge who carried out the inquiry, wrote in his report that the "primary cause of failing to prosecute Janner in 1991 was, in my judgment, an inefficient investigation by police".
However, Sir Richard said there was still enough evidence against Lord Janner in December 1991 to provide "a realistic prospect of conviction", and concluded the decision not to charge him was wrong.
Mr Creedon accused the inquiry of unfairly blaming the police.
"I do not recall us receiving any requests for further investigative work from either counsel or the CPS," he said.
