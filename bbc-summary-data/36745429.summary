Ricketts, 34, played 46 games for the Sky Blues last term, having joined in July 2015 after his release by Wolves.
"Sam knows what it takes to get out of this division. His versatility means he can play anywhere across the back-line," boss Tony Mowbray said.
"League One will be extremely competitive next season and Sam will play a vital role in leading the team."
Ricketts joins Marcus Tudgay in signing a new short-term deal with the club.
