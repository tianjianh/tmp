[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
England Saxons players Don Armand, Alec Hepburn and Mitch Lees have all signed new extended undisclosed-length deals at Premiership side Exeter Chiefs.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Flanker Armand, 27, has appeared 44 times for Exeter since joining from South African side Western Stormers.
Hepburn, 23, arrived from Australian club Perth Spirit in 2014-15 and has played 21 matches for the Chiefs.
Back-row forward Lees, 27, has played 31 times for Chiefs since joining from London Welsh in 2014.
Chiefs head coach Rob Baxter said: "Mitch and Don had real stand-out seasons last year and they are starting to show that they could be two of the best back-five forwards in the Premiership.
"That was shown by them going on the Saxons tour, while Alec has just been getting better and better in his time with us.
"We made a decision to bring him in early to the club and nurse him through some injury rehab, and I think that was a really good decision, and that allowed him to put some foundation work in, which allowed him to have a good season last year.
"I thought he was absolutely fantastic on the Saxons tour, probably one of the stand-out forwards."
