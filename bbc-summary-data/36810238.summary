[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Timothy Noel Green, from Sheffield, admitted stealing quantities of fish worth about £13,000 from a lorry he was driving in September 2013.
He also admitted stealing almost £6.000 worth of chicken drumsticks in October the same year and £29,000 worth of cheese a month later.
He was given an 18-month sentence at Sheffield Crown Court.
Green, of Rosemary Road, Beighton, pleaded guilty at an earlier hearing.
The court heard that on each occasion, Green took the items while transporting the goods to and from businesses and ports or freight terminals. Each shipping container was checked before it left one location and upon arrival at its destination. However, substantial quantities were found to be missing.
Investigating officer Det Con Thomas Ryan, of South Yorkshire Police, said: "This has been a three-year investigation into substantial thefts of goods from a number of locations and businesses across the country.
"Theft is not a victimless crime and Green stole significant quantities of popular items, which could have had a devastating impact on the businesses that were expecting these shipments."
The stolen goods have never been recovered, the force said.
