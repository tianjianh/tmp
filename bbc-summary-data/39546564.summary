Many areas in England and Wales reached at least 20C, the Met Office said.
The East Midlands and parts of East Anglia were among the sunniest areas, while Scotland and Northern Ireland have been cooler at 16C and 15C.
Forecasters said temperatures would return to spring levels by Monday - dropping by as much as 10 degrees.
In Somerset, firefighters said they used bolt croppers and cutters to free a woman whose leg was trapped in a sunlounger.
She was also given oxygen and an ambulance was called.
In Leicestershire, a country park suffered a "devastating" fire - which may have been caused by a barbecue or a discarded cigarette butt.
Forecasters warned people not to get caught out by the sun, which can be as strong in April as in August and September.
Temperatures are forecast to cool on Monday, however.
BBC Weather presenter Tomasz Schafernaker said: "Over the next 24 hours those areas that were warmest today will experience at least a 10 degree drop.
"Today warm air was wafting in from France; tomorrow cooler air will be streaming in from the north Atlantic."
