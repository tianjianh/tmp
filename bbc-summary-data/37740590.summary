[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Counter-terror police investigating the discovery of a suspicious item on a London Tube train say another device found in Devon was "not viable".

Homes were evacuated and a 200m cordon set up after the device was found at a house in Newton Abbot, earlier. The cordon has since been removed.
The first device was blown up in a controlled explosion at North Greenwich station on Thursday.
A 19-year-old man was later arrested in London in connection with the incident.
The Newton Abbot device was found by officers from the Metropolitan Police's counter-terrorism command, as they searched the house in Tudor Road on Saturday afternoon.
During the evacuation, three pitches at Baker's Park in the town were cleared.
Phil Smith, 62, who was refereeing a football match, said: "We were eight minutes into the match when suddenly a policeman appeared on the touchline and said, 'Sorry, you are going to have to stop playing and get out of the park - we want to land some helicopters on the football pitch.'
"He said there was an incident but couldn't say anything about it. He proceeded to hustle us all off and then he went to the children's play park and hustled all them out and was trying to get the car park clear."
After the device was declared non-viable, Devon and Cornwall Police said further forensic searches would continue at the house in Tudor Road and a police scene guard would remain in place.
The device destroyed at North Greenwich on Thursday was reported to have been found on an eastbound Jubilee Line train and handed to the Tube driver.
The driver treated it as a suspicious and said it contained "wires and possibly a clock".
The station was evacuated and members of the Met's bomb squad carried out the explosion, after the item was described as looking "real enough".
A 19-year-old man remains in police custody after being arrested in Holloway Road, north London, on Friday. A Taser was used during his arrest.
The Met said officers were keeping an open mind regarding any possible motive but said they were not looking for anyone else in relation to their investigation at this stage.
Security has been stepped up around the transport network in the wake of Thursday's events.
The current threat level for international terrorism in the UK is severe - meaning an attack is deemed to be "highly likely".
