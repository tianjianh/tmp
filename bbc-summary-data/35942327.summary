[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
April Fool's Day is here again and local newspapers have taken the opportunity to play pranks, hoaxes and practical jokes on their readers.

Here is a selection of the best, and worst, April Fools gags seen today.
The National Football Museum resides in a distinctive sloped building in the centre of Manchester. However, thrill-seekers could soon be taking the plunge down the six-storey sloping glass building before landing on a giant crash pad in Exchange Square, writes the Manchester Evening News.
It is billed as the largest "urban slide" of its kind anywhere in the world and a joint venture between the museum and French events company La Proofi!, a name which may, or may not, be a hint to readers.
Birmingham was once home to a much-lamented statue of King Kong, but the Birmingham Mail writes there could soon be a 100ft-tall replacement directly outside the city's new library.
Proposals for the giant structure - set to become "the Midlands' version of the Angel of the North" - are said to have gone on show.
Football fans were shocked to see Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp and Everton boss Roberto Martinez in a dance-off battle at HMV, according to the Liverpool Echo.
A video on the newspaper's website captured the moment high-street shoppers were left looking on in disbelief.
In Swindon, May Day is set to be a magical experience this year with plans for a huge maypole in the centre of the town's "world famous" Magic Roundabout.
The busy island will not be entirely closed to traffic. However, children from local primary schools will still be invited to dance around it holding traditional streamers, the Swindon Advertiser writes.
Gyllyngvase Beach in Falmouth is reported to be having under-sand heating installed to make it an all-year-round holiday destination.
The Falmouth Packet says the pilot scheme begins on 1 April and includes the installation of two large commercial gas boilers, 30 heating outlets and metres of under floor heating pipework installed.
In Cornwall, workers at The Lost Gardens of Heligan say they have managed to crossbreed a Devon and Cornwall Longwool sheep with a Tamworth pig, according to the Cornish Guardian.
The new heritage hybrid is reported to have been named a "Shig" with qualities including being "docile, friendly, with an approachable manner" as well as possessing a woollen coat.
Stoke-on-Trent's Westport Lake is to be transformed into Europe's  first all-weather ice-rink, says the Stoke Sentinel.
After top secret negotiations, the paper reports Nordic refrigeration giant Slushimushi has agreed to freeze the 0.8 mile circumference lake with a small area left free at one side for ducks and other wildlife.
In Bolton, a bakery has announced the launch of a new left-handed sandwich, for those who currently struggle to hold their lunch with sufficient agility.
Gemma Hall told the Bolton News: "As a left handed person myself I'm only too aware of the pitfalls of living in a right-handed world."
In Bristol, 20mph speed limits are already annoying drivers, but they could soon be forced to drive at just 10mph.
Planners were reported by the Bristol Post to be reviewing next generation road safety options now that all the city's 20mph zones have been phased in.
