Wakefield Trinity Ladies will enter the Women's Premier League, which currently contains 12 clubs, from 2017.
Championship sides Featherstone Rovers and Bradford Bulls already have teams competing in the division.
"As a team, this presents us with endless opportunities for players, coaches and team development," head coach Joanne Phillips said.
"More importantly it helps us to promote the women's game within the Wakefield community, and hopefully engage more women and girls to participate within rugby league."
Trinity Ladies will not be based at Wakefield's Belle Vue ground, and will instead play games at local amateur club Sharlston Rovers.
