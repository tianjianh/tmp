Deliveries to 120 Buckinghamshire homes have been suspended after a postman was attacked by a dog for a third time.

The attacks took place in Whaddon Chase, Aylesbury, and despite warnings from Royal Mail the dog's owner has declined to keep it under control.
The owner was asked to muzzle the dog during deliveries, Royal Mail said.
"In the latest attack, the postman suffered serious scratches. Previous attacks were more severe and required hospital treatment," a spokesman said.
The attacks take place in the street and this has led to a whole area being deprived of deliveries.
Dave Joyce, from the Communication Workers Union that campaigned for a strengthening of the Dangerous Dogs Act, said if the attacks had been on the owner's property then deliveries would have been denied just to that address.
However, the attacks have been on the street when the dog slipped its lead and attacked the postman.
Thames Valley Police said the first report had been made on 20 January this year.
"An officer gave advice to the dog owner on controlling their pet. Two further incidents have been reported to TVP which are currently being investigated."
Sally Hopkins, from the Royal Mail, said: "Deliveries to residents in Whaddon Chase have been temporarily suspended following a dog attack on one of our postmen on 16 September.
"This was the third time this dog has attacked our postman.
"Royal Mail has asked the owner to keep their dog under control. Unfortunately this hasn't happened.
"We only suspend deliveries if the safety of our postmen and women is at risk. We apologise for the inconvenience caused by this temporary suspension."
