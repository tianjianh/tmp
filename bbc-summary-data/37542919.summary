The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 0.5% lower at 18,168.45.
Meanwhile, the more tech-heavy Nasdaq lost 0.2% to 5,289.66 and the broader S&P 500 index fell 0.5% to 2,150.49.
UK Prime Minister Theresa May earlier said the country's divorce from the EU would not be "plain sailing".
"Clearly there has been some reverberation from across the pond in terms of the prospect for a slightly more disorderly UK separation from the EU," said Bill Northey, chief investment officer for the private client group at US Bank.
The prospect of an interest rate hike before the end of the year also caused renewed fears among investors after Richmond Federal Reserve President Jeffrey Lacker said he would have voted for an increase at the latest policy meeting had he been able to do so.
Traders now predict a 63% chance of a hike in December, according to CME Group.
