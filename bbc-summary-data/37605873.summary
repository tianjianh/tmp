By lunchtime, the FTSE 100 was up 5.72 points or 0.08% at 7,064.81.
Fresnillo and Randgold were among the top gainers, adding 1.7% and 1.3%.
Mining firms have benefited from the fall in the pound since the Brexit vote, since they generate most of their revenues abroad. A weaker pound boosts overseas revenues in sterling terms.
In early Monday trading, the pound was down another one-tenth of a cent against the dollar at $1.2426, but one-fifth of a cent higher against the euro at â‚¬1.1127.
The pound declined in value all last week, with traders nervous about how the UK's talks with the EU over leaving the bloc will progress.
Biggest gainer on the FTSE 100 was Rolls-Royce, which added 2.45% on the strength of a broker upgrade.
Firms in the construction sector were the biggest losers, with Travis Perkins, Persimmon and Taylor Wimpey shedding 2.5%, 2.2% and 2.2% respectively.
