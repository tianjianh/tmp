Cardiff City 2-2 Fulham

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Fulham edged nearer to the Championship play-off places with a thrilling draw at Cardiff City.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Stefan Johansen struck on the break to put the visitors ahead, before Kenneth Zohore equalised in a breathless first half.
Zohore's powerful half-volley put Cardiff in front, but Neeskens Kebano levelled with a deflected effort.
Fulham stay seventh in the table, now five points adrift of the top six, Cardiff remain 12th.
A share of the points was fitting for two sides whose attacking endeavour made for a compelling spectacle, on the day Bluebirds manager Neil Warnock signed a new contract.
The end-to-end entertainment was in striking contrast to January's sparsely-attended FA Cup tie between the same teams, in which Fulham outclassed a much-changed Cardiff side.
On this occasion, they encountered more resistance from the Bluebirds' first string, who peppered the visiting goal in a high-octane start to the game.
Despite initially not enjoying as much possession as they did last month, Fulham's pace made them a threat on the counter-attack - as they proved for the opening goal.
After a Cardiff free-kick was cleared, Tom Cairney fed Johansen, who sprinted clear and finished neatly inside the hosts' penalty area.
Warnock's side were not behind for long, with Zohore seizing on hesitant defending to stride forward and stroke the ball beyond David Button into the bottom corner.
Chances came at both ends at breakneck speed, and Cardiff maintained that intensity at the beginning of the second half.
Wingers Kadeem Harris and Junior Hoilett were a menace to the Fulham defence with their direct, quick running - but it was the impressive Zohore who made the most telling contributions.
His emphatic left-footed volley - his fourth goal in two games - looked like it would set the Bluebirds on their way to a fourth straight win.
But Slavisa Jokanovic's men salvaged a point as substitute Kebano's deflected shot dribbled apologetically into the net.
Cardiff City manager Neil Warnock said: "Very good for the neutral. We had an opportunity to win the game - if we'd have been four up at half-time I don't think anyone could have complained.
"But they're a good side, we knew they'd have opportunities. To score from our corner is like Sunday League, so to do it twice in a season is more than enough.
"It was a kick in the teeth but we came back strongly again. We didn't sulk and got the equaliser and, once we went in front, I thought we'd score more.
"But give them credit. They came back and they're a good side. Both teams could feel disappointed they didn't win it."
Fulham manager Slavisa Jokanovic said: "I believe the result is fair. We tried to use our weapons, Cardiff used a different style and created many chances.
"Cardiff are the best team in the Championship in 2017 so we didn't expect it to be easy.
"We created enough chances but we were not clinical. I'm disappointed but I have to accept the result as a fair result."
