A production of The Nutcracker which had been billed as the world's first "immersive" ballet has been put on hold.

Will Tuckett's take on Tchaikovsky's Christmas ballet had been due to open on 30 November in London.
But the production has been put on hold due to a lack of funding, organisers announced.
Producer Bob Watts said: "It is with enormous regret that we are having to put the production on hold."
"It was a huge privilege to see Will Tuckett's vision come to life - his Nutcracker was shaping up to be an extraordinary experience."
He added: "I hope it will come to a London audience soon."
The immersive element of the production would have allowed audience members to become guests at the Christmas party scene in the first act and wander through the Kingdom of the Sweets in Act Two.
The production had recently changed venues and was due to open at The Printworks in London's Canada Water.
Tuckett told The Guardian: "Everyone is saying to me that it's a really good show and that it's going to happen. It's just not going to happen right now."
The writer's previous credits include a 2014 production of The Wind and the Willows, which won the best entertainment and family prize at the Olivier Awards.
All ticket holders holders are in the process of being contacted and will receive a full refund, producers said.
