Cameras were put at 10 Birmingham sites in September 2013 and two more in 2014.
In the first two years cameras operated, 213,774 penalty charge notices (PCNs) were issued, a Freedom of Information (FOI) request showed.
Former Lib Dem MP John Hemming said the council had been "economical with the truth" on how it would spend the money.
The total income from fines was £6,157,359 from September 2013 - December 13 2015.

When the cameras were first installed, the Labour-run council denied claims it was a "money-making" move, saying income would be put into transport.
In a reply to a BBC FOI request, the council said the money had not yet been earmarked for any such projects: "The net surpluses from the Bus Lane Enforcement (i.e. total income less expenditure) have been taken to reserves and have not yet been spent on any specific project.
"Work is progressing to identify appropriate highways/transportation projects to fund."
Mr Hemming, who lost his seat as Liberal Democrat MP for Birmingham Yardley in 2015, said: "It's clear this was a route for the council to raise money.
"This money has just gone in the cocoa tin, it's not reserved for transport.
"We should be using taxes to fund public services, not fines."

When it began enforcing bus lane restrictions, the council also said its aim was to improve bus reliability, reduce CO2 emissions, encourage cycling and increase road safety.
In its reply to the BBC, the authority said it did not "hold any information which demonstrated any specific correlation between the issuing of PCNs and the factors mentioned".
The council said it had "always made clear" PCNs were not to make money but to reduce congestion and emissions.
Drivers who paid within 14 days of receiving a PCN could pay a 50% discounted fine of £30. If paid within 28 days, the penalty was £60, and £90 if it was late.
In February 2014, a tribunal found signage was inadequate or confusing at three of the 10 locations and the council came under fire following a story by the Birmingham Mail.
The authority introduced extra signage at three locations between April and June 2014, which it said exceeded the tribunal's recommendations.
