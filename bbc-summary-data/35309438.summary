The body of Yiannoulla Yianni, 17, was found by her parents at their home in Hampstead, north London, in 1982.
James Warnock, of Harrington Street, north London, was arrested on Tuesday and will appear at Hendon Magistrates' Court on Thursday.
Yiannoulla was a student of Quintin Kynaston School in St John's Wood.
Det Insp Julie Willats of the Metropolitan Police's homicide and major crime command, said: "The Met never closes unsolved murders.
"Regardless of the passage of time, cases can and will be reviewed for any new opportunities to develop previously unknown lines of inquiry and to follow-up any fresh information which has become known to us."
Yiannoulla, who had a part-time job at Woolworths on Finchley Road, north London, died on Friday, 13 August, 1982.
Her body was found by her parents at about 15:00 BST, police said. She had been raped and strangled.
In the years following her death more than 1,000 witness statements were taken in the case, which has been periodically reviewed.
