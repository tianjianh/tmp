The two-time 100m Olympic gold medallist and three-time world champion plans to return to action in 2018.
The 30-year-old sprinter said she had hoped to defend her title in London.
"But life is filled with many blessings with God. So here I am thinking about being the greatest mother I can be with my biggest blessing," she added.
