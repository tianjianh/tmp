[SN]TITLE[SN]
Paul McCauley death: Piper John McClements charged with murder

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man has appeared in court in Londonderry charged with murdering Paul McCauley, who died last month.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Mr McCauley was left in a persistent vegetative state after he was attacked and beaten in the city nine years ago.
Piper John McClements whose address was given as the Fountain was granted bail.
A detective constable told the court the accused was formerly known as Daryl Procter and had previously pleaded guilty to causing grievous bodily harm to Mr McCauley and served a sentence.
The police officer said she believed she could connect Mr McClements to the murder charge.
Opposing bail, the detective constable said she believed others were involved in the 2006 attack and if he was released he could interfere with persons and the course of justice.
A defence solicitor said Mr McClements was on High Court bail for two years during the previous case and never breached his conditions.
He also said that his client had already accepted responsibility for his part in this case and he would not benefit from interfering with anyone.
The 24-year-old was bailed to reappear in court next month.
