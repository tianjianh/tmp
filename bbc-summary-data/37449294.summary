A university has launched an investigation after students wore T-shirts featuring racist and anti-Semitic slogans at a social event.

A series of offensive slogans were written on T-shirts for a pub crawl in Exeter on Tuesday.
Photographs of the T-shirts were posted on Facebook.
A University of Exeter spokesman said: "Anti-Semitic, racist or bigoted behaviour in any form is not tolerated".
The photographs later appeared on the +972 website, an online magazine which reports events in Israel and Palestine.
Marie van der Zyl, vice president of the Board of Deputies of British Jews, the national representative body of the UK Jewish community, said: "These students are clearly in need of some history lessons.
"Their attempt to make light of the Holocaust and racism may have been intended as a prank, but we don't find it funny at all".
The pub crawl was hosted by the university's Exeter Snowsports society. It said the issue is being dealt with by the university press office and it has no further comment.
The Athletic Union, which oversees sport on the campus, has banned any future sporting social events which involve the practice of students writing on t-shirts.
