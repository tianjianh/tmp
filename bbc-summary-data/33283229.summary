[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Over £1m has been raised during the first six months of a scheme to fine motorists using Cardiff bus lanes.

Seven cameras were installed around the city, with 29,212 motorists caught since they began operating last December.
Fines are £35, rising to £70 if they are not paid within 21 days. The figures were gained from a Freedom of Information request.
The council said the money will be used for road and traffic improvements.
The cameras - installed at Crwys Road, Custom House Street, Duke Street, Kingsway, Newport Road, Park Place and Westgate Street - brought in £1,072,505 up to 19 June.
Latest figures show most drivers were caught on Newport Road (2,772) and Westgate Street (1,719) during May.
A Cardiff council spokesman said: "The enforcement ensures that the bus lanes are only used for buses and authorised vehicles, which makes travel by bus more direct and quicker."
He added that all money generated is spent covering the costs of the scheme and on highway or traffic improvements.
