Johnston, 28, was airlifted to Noble's Hospital on the island after coming off his bike in Supersport practice.
Race organisers initially described his injuries as "facial and minor back injuries, bumps and bruises".
However in a later tweet, the Northern Irishman said he had sustained a "broken back, coccyx and finger".
Johnston also said that he would be transferred to hospital in Liverpool on Sunday.
The Fermanagh man was competing in the final day of practice so he will be ruled out of racing at the meeting which starts with Sunday's rescheduled opening Superbike race.
County Londonderry man Paul Jordan, 25, sustained a broken wrist and a lower back injury in another crash while Kent rider Danny Webb dislocated a shoulder in a further practice spill on Saturday morning.
Johnston's crash occurred at the Greeba Castle section of the circuit after he had earlier set the fastest speed in Saturday's Supersport sesson.
He was riding a Padgett's Supersport Honda and the session was red-flagged after the crash as the Northern Irishman was taken to hospital by air ambulance.
Maguiresbridge man Johnston was scheduled to ride a BMW in the Superbike and Superstock classes and was also down to compete for Ryan Farquhar's KMR team in the Lightweight class for Supertwins.
Jordan's crash happened just after the Glen Helen section of the course in Supertwins practice.
Bjorn Gunnarsson from Sweden was also involved in that accident but was unhurt.
The incident saw the red flags brought out and the session temporarily suspended before practice resumed.
