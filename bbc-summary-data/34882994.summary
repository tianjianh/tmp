St Mary's Church in Barby, Northamptonshire, was packed with those paying tribute to Mr Lomax, who died earlier this month at the age of 67.
He was a founding member of the NTST and a pioneer of supporters' involvement with their football clubs.
The Cobblers Trust was the first of its kind when it was formed and became a template for many other clubs.
Andy Burnham, a Labour MP and former Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport, was a pall bearer.
He said: "I wouldn't be anywhere else, because Brian had a very big impact on my life.
"He was a true father figure to many of us and that's why we had such a huge turn out here today.
"He changed our lives when we were young men, radical men, who wanted football to change for the better and Brian Lomax offered us a vision for how that could be done."
Mr Lomax was the first managing director of Supporters Direct and stepped down as its chairman in 2009.
He also served as a Liberal Democrat councillor on Daventry District Council.
