Harrison has been preferred at openside flanker, with Nathan Hughes on the bench, while Billy Vunipola has proved his fitness to start at number eight.
Mike Brown and Jonny May are left out of the 23-man squad, with Goode, Rokoduguni and Elliot Daly making up an all-new back three.
Jonathan Joseph returns at centre.
Head coach Eddie Jones was due to name his side on Thursday, but delayed his decision due to injury concerns.
Saracens' Vunipola, 24, had been a doubt after suffering a knock in last weekend's win over South Africa.
"While we were satisfied with last week's result against South Africa, there was plenty to improve on," said Jones.
"We want a much more complete performance on Saturday. We want to be in total control of the game and tidy-up the things we didn't do well enough last weekend."
When England play Fiji on Saturday, the Rugby Football Union will reportedly bank up to £10m - giving Fiji £75,000 as a "goodwill gesture".
Fiji's players will only be paid £400 each for the match, which former England scrum-half Matt Dawson says is 'farcical'. England's players will get £22,000 each.
However, England boss Jones says his only concern is his team's performance.
"It's not my job to discuss rugby politics. I'm a coach, I coach England and I'm only worried about England," he said.
"I'm not an accountant. Why would I be worried about what they're getting paid?
"I know our players sacrifice a lot to play for England. They sacrifice time away from their families, so whatever the RFU decide to pay them is the right amount.
"But [Fijian pay] is a matter for the Fijian rugby union and I'm sure they are looking at it carefully, and doing everything they can to pay the players."
