The show at the Fonda Theatre marked next month's reissue of the 1971 LP that includes Brown Sugar and Wild Horses.
The audience on Wednesday included Jack Nicholson, Bruce Willis, Harry Styles, Leonard Cohen and Patricia Arquette.
The concert at the 1,300-capacity venue sold out instantly.
"So this is our first show of our tour,'' Sir Mick Jagger told the crowd, according to the Associated Press. "Tonight we're doing something we've never done before... we're going to do the whole of Sticky Fingers."
The Stones played for an hour and a half, and used its encore to pay tribute to the blues guitar legend BB King, who died last week.
"He was one of our favourite guitarists," Sir Mick said, "a wonderful guy who played with us on a number of occasions."
The Stones kick off their North American Zip Code tour in San Diego on Sunday.
