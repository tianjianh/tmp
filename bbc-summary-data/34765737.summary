Residents in a village have been told they will not receive their mail in the run-up to Christmas after a postwoman was left terrified by a dog.

About 70 households in Ystalyfera, Neath Port Talbot, have had deliveries suspended after Royal Mail said a mastiff dog cornered the worker "for half an hour, terrified in a garden".
Villagers will now have to collect mail from Pontardawe, five miles (8km) away.
Royal Mail said it was working to sort things out "as quickly as possible".
Spokeswoman Val Bodden said the temporary measure was a last resort and the firm took the safety of its staff very seriously.
"The dog was already known to us and in July this year the owner responded to our request to install a box at the gate to enable the delivery person to deliver without entering the property.
"However, last Monday the dog was loose on neighbouring Prospect Place and the postwoman had to seek refuge."
Postal services have been suspended for two weeks in the streets around Zoar Road, Canal Terrace and Prospect Place, the area where the dog was seen.
Residents said they did not want to have to travel to pick up their mail.
"It incurs costs to get there and back, and it's just an inconvenience," said Catt Spence, who lives on Canal Terrace.
"We are very concerned about the attack, don't get me wrong, the Royal Mail have to look after their people.
"The dog is quite notorious, it's quite a fierce dog, it is aggressive.
"But it's put a lot of people out and I don't think they've really thought about the consequences on the elderly and the disabled, and young mothers who haven't got transport."
Royal Mail said bosses checked on Thursday to see if it was safe for deliveries to restart, but the dog was reportedly loose on the street on Friday.
Ms Bodden said customers can contact Royal Mail to make alternative arrangements to receive their mail.
Royal Mail said there were 140 dog attacks on postal workers in Wales between 2014 and 2015.
