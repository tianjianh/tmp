Dapper Laughs: ITV2 says no second series for comedian

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
ITV has told Newsbeat it's dropping the controversial comedian Dapper Laughs.

The Vine star - real name Daniel O'Reilly - was recently seen in the ITV2 series Dapper Laughs: On The Pull.
He has provoked outrage with jokes about rape and homeless people.
An ITV spokesman told Newsbeat: "We have given careful thought to the recent criticism of the character Dapper Laughs, which has focused on his activities outside of the ITV2 programme.
"We have taken the decision that we will not be considering this show for a second series."
An online petition has been calling on ITV to scrap the show.
The man behind the campaign told Newsbeat the show wasn't risquÃ© comedy and described it as "dangerous".
Tom Zephyr - who asked us not to use his real name - said: "We need a civilised fightback against this 'laddish' culture".
His campaign said the Dapper Laughs show used "misogynistic views, all under the guise of harmless comedy" and argued that the comedian's work frequently depicted "real-life harassment of women".
"While I am glad that there will be no more Dapper Laughs on our screens, I cannot regard the petition a success until ITV recognise their errors. People are worried about lad culture in general, not just Dapper Laughs, and ITV haven't yet admitted that they failed their duty of responsibility towards their viewers."
ITV's decision comes as a video was posted online showing Dapper Laughs saying to an audience member that she was "gagging for a rape".
We've asked Daniel O'Reilly for an interview and are still waiting for a response.
