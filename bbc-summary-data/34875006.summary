[SN]TITLE[SN]
Chester rough sleeping ban criticised by police commissioner

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Plans to fine rough sleepers in Chester are "not appropriate", Cheshire's police and crime commissioner has said.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Cheshire West and Chester Council originally proposed to introduce a public space protection order, which would ban sleeping on the streets.
Following public consultation, however, a report recommends councillors should scrap the proposal, which would also have prohibited unauthorised busking.
Under the plans, anybody in breach of the rules faced a fine of up to Â£1,000.
Of the original idea to fine rough sleepers, police and crime commissioner John Dwyer said: "I don't think it's appropriate - I think there needs to be a proper discussion about how we deal with people who sleep rough.
"Clearly you've got to feel sorry for these people. Some of them aren't genuine... but for genuine rough sleepers, genuine people who've got nowhere else to go, I think we need to have a discussion properly at all sorts of levels as to how we deal with that problem."
Public Space Protection Orders (PSPOs) were introduced under last year's Anti-Social Behaviour, Crime and Policing Act.
The Chester plans, which were outlined in July by the council and Cheshire Police, would have "controlled and restricted" seven activities, including rough sleeping.
Activities that could be "controlled and restricted":
Activities removed from proposals:
A council consultation found 58% of respondents were against the rough sleeping proposals, while 77% of respondents recommended the council scrap the plans to fine unauthorised buskers and instead introduce in a code of conduct.
Councillor Nicole Meardon said: "We have responded to this feedback by recommending that these measures are removed from the proposals and I look forward to continuing discussions about the measures where public opinion is mixed."
Cheshire West and Chester Council said it would also improve emergency provision for rough sleepers.
A final decision on the proposals will be made in early 2016.
