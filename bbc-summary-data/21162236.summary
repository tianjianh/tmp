[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Humberside police and crime commissioner (PCC) Matthew Grove has put forward the Tayside chief constable Justine Curran as the force's new head.
Her appointment must be approved by the police and crime panel which oversees the force when it meets on 15 February.
Sheffield-born Ms Curran served as an officer in the Greater Manchester and Merseyside forces, before becoming Tayside chief in 2009.
Ms Curran said she was "delighted" at being put forward for the role of chief constable which covers the areas of East Yorkshire and northern Lincolnshire.
She added: "I look forward to moving to the area with my family and getting down to work in this important and challenging role."
Humberside PCC Matthew Grove said: "I always said this would be the most significant decision I would make.
"I am delighted to have secured the services of an outstanding leader with a proven track record.
"Justine clearly brings sound experience as an existing chief constable, having worked in some extremely challenging areas of the country."
If approved, Ms Curran will replace Tim Hollis who is retiring at the end of March after eight years in the job.
Mr Hollis said: "As a serving chief in her own right, Justine understands the demands of leading a modern police force and managing the complex challenges we face."
John Blanchard, chair of the Humberside Police Federation, which represents rank and file police officers, said: "We look forward to working with her in the future for the benefit of the officers and the public."
