Wye Valley NHS Trust said its "wish list" included redeveloping 75-year-old huts at Hereford County Hospital.
Originally introduced as temporary accommodation during World War Two, they are today used as inpatient wards.
A trust spokesman said the extent of the work would depend on how much money the Department of Health would allow them to borrow.
Wye Valley has appointed Keir as its main partner to deliver the project, which is also expected to see extra beds introduced.
Proposals include building a new intensive care unit and outpatient theatres, as well as relocating endoscopy and day surgery facilities.
The hospital trust was put in special measures in October after being rated "inadequate" by the Care Quality Commission.
Medical care and A&E at Hereford's County Hospital attracted particular criticism.
Speaking in February, chief executive Richard Beeken said the hospital needed 30 to 40 more beds to help it cope with demand.
