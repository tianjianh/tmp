[SN]TITLE[SN]
Swindon Town 1-1 Milton Keynes Dons

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Jonathan Obika's last-minute equaliser kept Swindon's League One survival hopes alive by securing draw with MK Dons.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The away side had taken the lead two minutes before half-time with a penalty courtesy of Kieran Agard.
The Dons will feel hard done by after being the better team for much of the game, which saw them denied by post, bar and a fine display by Robins keeper Lawrence Vigouroux.
The home side almost took the lead in the second minute, with a ball chipped into the box by Conor Thomas but George Williams was able to clear for the visitors.
In the 29th minute the Robins had a penalty claim of their own, Nicky Ajose went to the floor following a challenge from Williams but the referee waved play on.
Two minutes before the break Ben Reeves was brought down in the area by Charlie Colkett, Agard put the ball to the right, and although Vigouroux dived the right way was unable to get a hand to it.
Obika rescued a draw with virtually the last kick of the game when he raced clear and slotted home.
