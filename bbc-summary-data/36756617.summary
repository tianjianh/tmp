The former champion was one over for his third round before four birdies from the 11th gave him a 69 to lie eight under and four off the pace.
Sweden's Alex Noren holds a two-shot lead with McDowell tied sixth.
Padraig Harrington is five under after a 72 while Belfast player Michael Hoey is well adrift with a 74 leaving him on four over.
England's Tyrrell Hatton and Matteo Manassero are Noren's closest challengers on 10 under.
McDowell, who won the tournament at Loch Lomond in 2008, struggled on the outward nine with bogeys at two and seven while he picked up a shot at the fourth.
The 2010 US Open champion finally capitalised on better scoring conditions with a birdie at 11 followed by three in a row from the 14th.
