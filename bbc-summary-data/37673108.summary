Now Mount Stewart, the historic 18th century house in County Down, can add another accolade after winning a top UK prize for conservation.
It scooped the building conservation award at the 2016 RICS (Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors) Awards.
The honour was for work carried out as part of a three-year Â£8m refurbishment.
Mount Stewart, which is located near Newtownards and has been owned by the National Trust since 1977, reopened last year after the refurbishment was complete.
Judges said the project used "highly innovative" techniques to "repair serious structural defects throughout the property".
"Judges were further impressed by the clear collaboration in pioneering the approach of undertaking the works whilst maintaining the building open to the public with the highly successful outcome of increasing visitor numbers and visitor experience," the judges said.
Mount Stewart won the award ahead of competition from projects across the UK including Cardigan Castle in Wales and the Garden Building at Oxford University.
The house has belonged to the Marquesses of Londonderry since 1740 and visitors to the residence over the years have included members of the Royal Family and Winston Churchill.
William Butler Yeats was a frequent visitor to the house and a friend of Lady Mairi Bury, the youngest daughter of the Marquess who died in 2009.
