Liberia country profile

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Liberia is Africa's oldest republic, but it became known in the 1990s for its long-running, ruinous civil war and its role in a rebellion in neighbouring Sierra Leone.

Although founded by freed American and Caribbean slaves, Liberia is mostly inhabited by indigenous Africans, with the slaves' descendants comprising 5% of the population.
Around 250,000 people were killed in Liberia's civil war and many thousands more fled the fighting.
Big programmes are under way to address the shortage of electricity and running water. Corruption is rife and unemployment and illiteracy are endemic.

Major religions Christianity, Islam, indigenous beliefs

Currency Liberian dollar
President: Ellen Johnson Sirleaf
Ellen Johnson Sirleaf became Africa's first female president in 2005, two years after the end of a brutal 14-year conflict.
She was re-elected in November 2011 in a poll marred by a low turn-out and a boycott by her main rival, Winston Tubman.
Critics accuse her of having little to show for her first term, but supporters say she deserves praise for ensuring stability in the country.
She was awarded the Nobel peace prize in 2011 for what the prize committee said were her efforts to secure peace, promote economic and social development and strengthen the position of women.
Born in 1938, she is a widowed mother-of-four.
Years of civil war left Liberia's media with the task of rebuilding. Many outlets still rely on financial support from politicians or international donors.
Large fines imposed in libel cases have encouraged self-censorship despite the enacting of West Africa's first freedom of information law in 2010, reports US-based Freedom House.
