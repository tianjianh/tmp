Mr Jones said the Tory strategy was to "hit Scotland, hit Wales" but they were "too afraid to hit Northern Ireland".
He was on a tour of three seats in south Wales Labour is targeting.
In response, the Conservatives said they had a "long-term economic plan that is securing a better future for people in Wales".
Speaking in Barry, in the Vale of Glamorgan, on Thursday, Mr Jones said: "The Conservative strategy now seems to be 'get out the English nationalist vote, hit Scotland, hit Wales, oh we're too afraid to hit Northern Ireland' - of course, that's the way they are.
"Where does that leave the UK in the future?
"And I'm really, seriously concerned that the Tories have given up on Britain."
A Conservative spokesperson said: "The Conservatives have spent the last five years demonstrating our commitment here, and our record speaks for itself.
"We have helped to get more than 50,000 more people in Wales into work with the security of a regular pay packet, and we have cut income tax for more than a million.
"The Conservatives have a track record and whatever Carwyn Jones says, the choice on May 7 is a clear one. It is between the competence of the Conservatives, continuing to build a strong Britain, or the chaos of Ed Miliband propped up by the SNP."
