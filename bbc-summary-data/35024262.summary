England cancer drug move Irfon Williams 'in remission'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A cancer patient from Gwynedd who had to move to England to get treatment not available in Wales has been told he is officially in remission.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Irfon Williams, 44, from Bangor, had been given two years to live after being diagnosed with bowel cancer.
He was given the drug Cetuximab, which was paid for by the English Cancer Drugs Fund after he moved to live with relatives in north west England.
Mr Williams told BBC's Radio Cymru that tests had shown no sign of cancer.
Posting on Facebook, he said: "Two years ago to this week I started with symptoms of abdominal pain and constipation.
"Tests were carried out and it was discovered I had bowel cancer which had spread to the liver.
"After two years of treatment I am pleased to say (even though I'm still recovering from surgery) that blood tests and scans have shown no signs of cancer and I am formally in remission.
"Thank you everyone from the bottom of my heart for their support."
Mr Williams has campaigned on cancer drug provision, including meeting First Minister Carwyn Jones in the summer.
The Welsh government has previously said it funds proven treatments.
"The Cancer Drugs Fund in England funds non-approved medicines that deliver little or no benefit for patients," a spokesman said.
"We have no plans to introduce a cancer drugs fund in Wales."
