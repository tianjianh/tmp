Gwynedd man 'stole Caernarfon lamb for Christmas dinner'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man from Gwynedd who did not want turkey for Christmas has admitted stealing a lamb and taking it home.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Gareth Williams, 34, of Lon Bach, Caernarfon, stole the live animal from a farm outside the town on 6 December.
But Caernarfon Magistrates' Court heard the lamb refused to jump out of his car so he took it to an industrial estate where it was released and vanished.
Williams, a trained butcher, pleaded guilty to theft and was ordered to carry out 75 hours of unpaid work.
"He said he didn't fancy turkey for Christmas this year and asked if he could buy a live lamb," Sheyanne Lee, for the prosecution, said.
A price of £100 was agreed but Williams instead stole the animal and took it home, she added.
His unhappy partner told him to return it but instead he took it to the industrial estate in the hope it would make its way back to the farm.
Williams was also ordered to pay £100 compensation and £170 costs.
