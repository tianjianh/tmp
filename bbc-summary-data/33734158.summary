The rhino that seriously injured a senior keeper at Whipsnade Zoo had not shown any "uncharacteristic behaviour" beforehand, a report has revealed.

The man, in his 50s, was found semi-conscious at the zoo on 19 November.
Central Bedfordshire Council said the zoo's animal health and behavioural day logs had been "fully completed".
"[They] did not identify any issues to suggest abnormal or uncharacteristic behaviour of the rhino in the lead up to the date," a statement said.
The council said the injured man had also signed training records regarding the risk assessments of the rhino house in February 2014.
The keeper was found in the pool area of the rhino enclosure at the zoo near Dunstable.
The colleague who discovered him closed the gates to the outside paddock to isolate the animal before attending to the injured man.
He was taken to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge in a "serious" condition and found to have injuries to the chest, abdomen and pelvis.
The council investigation into how the injuries occurred was unable to establish the cause.
Earlier this month, the authority said it would not release its full report but officials had concluded no further action was needed and the zoo said it would continue to work on health and safety procedures.
Neither the zoo nor the council will confirm whether the keeper is still in hospital.
