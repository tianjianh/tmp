Officers were called to the Blossoms Pub in Holyhead at about 16:00 GMT following reports a 24-year-old man had assaulted another man, aged 46.
The injured man died despite efforts to revive him, North Wales Police said.
The other man then climbed onto the roof of the nearby Holland Inn. After negotiations, he was arrested.
Police said he was being held in police custody and an investigation had been launched.
Supt Andy Jenks-Gilbert said: "I would like to take this opportunity to reassure the public that there is no danger to local residents."
Much of the town centre was sealed off after emergency services were called to the Holborn Road area of the town on Friday afternoon.
Police had warned members of the public to avoid the area and ordered nearby businesses to close.
A Wales Ambulance spokesman said it was called at 16:10 GMT and sent an ambulance.
Speaking earlier on Friday, Tony Pan, from the Happy House Chinese takeaway, said police had told him to close due to a serious incident.
He said: "We have also been advised not the leave the building."
He added that he had seen one ambulance and four police cars in the Rhos y Gaer Terrace area.
Carol Roberts, who works at Roberts Newsagents, said: "A police officer is asking us not to go out. No cars [are] going up and down the road.
"I can hear the police helicopter, never seen so many police cars and policemen."
