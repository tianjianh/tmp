The theatre which hosted the World Figure Skating Championships in 1898, will host The Imperial Ice Stars for The Nutcracker on Ice.
Four-time figure skating world champion and dual Olympic gold medallist Evgeny Platov is one member of the cast of 26.
Keith Chegwin and Olga Sharutenko from ITV's Dancing on Ice will also take part in the show from 24 October.
The production, which has already toured South Africa, Australia, New Zealand and Asia, will move on to Cardiff and Southampton after the London shows.
Artistic Director Tony Mercer said: "The exotic divertissements from Spain, China, Arabia, Russia and Egypt allow us to introduce some gymnastics, flying, acrobatics, fire and illusions."
Set in St Petersburg the Nutcracker follows Marie whose Nutcracker doll comes to life and leads her on adventures with the Mouse King, the Prince, and the Sugar Plum Fairy.
