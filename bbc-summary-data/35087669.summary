Corbisiero, whose Saints contract expires in the summer, has struggled with injuries since 2012 and had an operation on his knee last week.
The 27-year-old has 20 Test caps for England and played twice for the British and Irish Lions on their successful tour of Australia in 2013.
"It was a tough decision to come to," said the loose-head prop.
"But I think it will be the best thing going forward for me.
"Being a rugby player is a 24/7 lifestyle. That is why when my contract is over I will be taking a break from that full-time commitment to relax."
US-born Corbisiero started his career at London Irish and made his England debut against Italy in the 2011 Six Nations.
He joined Northampton in 2013, but has been affected by knee and shoulder problems, and he missed this year's World Cup with a back injury.
"I would just like to reiterate I am fully committed to giving everything I have physically and mentally for Northampton Saints for the remainder of this season," he added.
Corbisiero told the Sunday Times the decision was "way more mental than physical".
