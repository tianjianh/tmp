Richie Foran; Further injury misery for Inverness CT captain

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Inverness Caley Thistle captain Richie Foran may not play again this season after tearing a calf muscle.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 35-year-old sustained the injury in training earlier this week, adding to miserable run of fitness problems.
The Irish midfielder has been limited to three appearances as a substitute this term, having been dogged by various knee complaints.
Foran returned last July after a 21-month absence following a knee injury that required surgery.
Having been at the Highland club since 2009, he is out of contract at the end of the season and started coaching when his injury rehabilitation commenced in 2014.
