Striker Fernando Llorente will offer Swansea City a different forward option this season, says goalkeeper Lukasz Fabianksi.

Spain international Llorente, 31, joined from Sevilla on a two-year deal.
He made his debut in the 1-0 win at Burnley and after his late header was saved by Tom Heaton, Leroy Fer struck to score Swansea's winner.
"Fernando has that physical presence that can help us in difficult times," Fabianski said.
"For me personally it's a bit easier. When we're under pressure and I have to kick a longer ball. I know he can do the job for us."

Llorente and fellow Spanish striker Borja have bolstered Swansea's forward options following the departures of Andre Ayew, Alberto Paloschi, Eder and Bafetimbi Gomis.
Fabianksi, who played in four of Poland's five games at Euro 2016, was pleased with the win and a clean sheet in their Premier League opener at Turf Moor.
He also hailed the performance of central defenders Federico Fernandez and Jordi Amat, coming only days after Ashley Williams' departure to Everton.
"It's a confidence boost for the centre-backs," Fabianski added.
"I think they've done a really good job, especially playing against very physical opponents.
"We stood up to them physically and we can be happy with that.
"It's always great to start with a win, especially playing away from home.
"It always gives you that confidence for the next game and tells you the work you did in pre-season was good work and it paid off."
