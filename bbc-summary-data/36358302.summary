BBC Radio Humberside understands that North Ferriby United boss Billy Heath will take over in the next few days.
Harvey, 57, led recently relegated Town to FA Trophy victory at Wembley on Sunday with a 1-0 victory over Grimsby.
"I would love to bring this team back up and restore a little bit of pride in the town," he told BBC Radio Leeds.
"That's a question (about his future) that you need to ask the chairman and I couldn't elaborate any more than that. I would love the opportunity."
Halifax had three managers at The Shay in 2015-16, with Neil Aspin sacked in September following just one win from 10 games.
His replacement Darren Kelly was dismissed after 47 days, while under Harvey the team were relegated from the National League but claimed victory on their first trip to Wembley.
"I wish I had more time with them because we could get better still," Harvey added.
"To come here and beat a team that has just gone into the Football League, and to beat them twice in the last couple of months, that's pretty massive."
Heath recently led North Ferriby into the National League by winning the National League North promotion final against AFC Fylde.
