Alan Stubbs: Rotherham United appoint Hibernian boss as their new manager

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Rotherham United have appointed Hibernian boss Alan Stubbs as their new manager on a three-year contract.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 44-year-old was given permission to speak to the Championship club on Monday but resigned from his Hibs role, according to Rotherham, to take over.
He leaves Hibs less than two weeks after guiding the Easter Road side to a first Scottish Cup win in 114 years.
And his exit comes despite the two clubs having yet to reach an agreement over compensation.
The former Celtic and Everton defender replaces Neil Warnock at the New York Stadium.
Warnock kept the Millers in the second tier last season but left at the end of the campaign, saying it would have been "wrong" of him to sign a new deal.
Stubbs took over at Hibs in June 2014 following their relegation from the Scottish Premiership.
They finished second and third in his two seasons in charge but were unable to gain promotion via the play-offs on both occasions.
He will be joined at Rotherham by assistant John Doolan, who also resigned from his position as first-team coach at Hibs.
