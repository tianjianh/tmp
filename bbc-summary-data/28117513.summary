An artist who became the youngest to paint an official portrait of The Queen has turned his hand to her grandson, the Duke of Cambridge.

The painting of Prince William by Cardiff-born Dan Llywelyn Hall will be unveiled at the Wales Office later.
Hall says the duke's new role as a parent was the inspiration for the oil-on-canvas piece, entitled Fatherhood.
He is also painted wearing a poppy, to mark the 100th anniversary of World War One.
The painting will be sold in October in aid of The Victoria Cross Trust and War Memorials Trust.
The work is based on a meeting at the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff when William viewed Hall's portrait of the Queen called Icon, commissioned by the Welsh Rugby Union.
William became a father to Prince George on 22 July last year.
The artist, 33, said: "Fatherhood is a portrait about a universal theme: the concerns, hopes and aspirations of a family man."
His portraits of WW1 veterans Henry Allingham and Harry Patch were displayed at Windsor Castle and The National Portrait Gallery and are now a permanent feature in the Royal Collection and the Victoria Art Gallery in Bath.
Hall became the youngest person to paint the Queen, although the portrait  prompted a mixed reaction.
