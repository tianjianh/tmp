Andrew Glaister, 47, from the Isle of Man, and John Milburn, 19, of Crosby, had attended the Boxing Day event at Nation in Wolstenholme Square.
A 22-year-old man was arrested and he is not being "directly linked" to the deaths at this stage, police said.
A warning has been issued over MDMA tablets believed to be in circulation.
Merseyside Police said the tablets appear to be shield shaped, orange or red with a lion or griffin logo on them.
Supt Mark Wiggins said: "Please don't take that, don't take any drugs whatsoever because we don't want a tragedy over the new year period."
A post-mortem examination has been carried out on Mr Glaister but further toxicology tests are being undertaken.
Cream, a so-called "super club", first opened its doors at Nation in 1992 and went on to become an international brand branching out into Cream Ibiza and the Creamfields festival.
The Boxing Day event was held to mark the last Cream club night at the venue, which is closing.
The arrested man from Seaforth, Merseyside, has been released on bail.
