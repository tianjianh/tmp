A Borders football club's concrete stand has become one of the most protected in Scotland after being upgraded to a category A-listing.

Historic Scotland regards the Gala Fairydean Rovers FC grandstand as of "national importance."
It previously had a B-listing but has now been upgraded.
Chairman Kevin Temple said he knew people had mixed views of the structure but the club was proud of the stand and its history.
The grandstand was officially opened in 1964 and the stadium now boasts a Â£1m artificial playing surface for the Lowland League side.
Mr Temple said he welcomed the move to upgrade its status.
"The new listing may result in some restrictions on what can be done but it should also mean access to get grants if work requires  done," he said.
The stand was designed by architect Peter Womersley and cost Â£25,000 to build which was paid for by a lottery run by Gala Fairydean and Gala Rovers which amalgamated in the summer.
A spokeswoman for Historic Scotland said: "Historic Scotland undertook a review of our country's remarkable sporting buildings in the run up to Glasgow's Commonwealth Games.
"As part of this work, we have recently updated the listing for Gala Fairydean Rovers Stadium in Galashiels from Category B to A, recognising it as a building of outstanding architectural and national importance.
"The Gala Fairydean Rovers football stand is a significant work of late modernist architecture in Scotland."
She said the stadium had a "highly distinctive design, constructed in concrete, comprising four V-sectioned vertical fins supporting a wedge-shaped stand and a cantilevered canopy".
