He guided the club to promotion from the Championship in May.
"To secure Andy and that stability, we're very pleased he will be there to deliver our plan," chairman Chris Booy told BBC Radio Bristol.
Robinson told the club website: "With Premiership rugby on the horizon, it's a great time to be involved and to guide this squad of talented players into a new chapter for Bristol."
