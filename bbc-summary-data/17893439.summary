He oozes knowledge. Every day on the training ground, players are learning. His enthusiasm is a strength too. Some of the young lads don't even have the enthusiasm he has and he's been in the game 40-odd years. He keeps you mentally challenged as well. The training sessions that he puts on are not just run of the mill, the same ones every day, you have to think about what you do every day. The players are well-drilled, well-organised and everybody knows what each other is doing.
