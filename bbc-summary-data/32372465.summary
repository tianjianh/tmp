Abdul Hadi Arwani, 48, was found dead on 7 April in Wembley. He was believed to be a critic of Syria's President Bashar al-Assad.
A 36-year-old man was arrested on Friday on suspicion of conspiracy to murder and has since been bailed.
Two people arrested remain in custody and a man has been charged with murder.
Leslie Cooper, 36, appeared in court charged with Mr Arwani's murder.
At Camberwell Green Magistrates' Court Mr Cooper, of Nightingale Road, Brent, was remanded in custody.
Last week, officers said they were searching a number of addresses including the mosque at the An Noor Cultural and Community Centre in Acton, west London, where Mr Arwani had been an imam.
Mr Arwani, who was a British national, was found with bullet injuries to his chest in a parked car at the junction of Greenhill and The Paddocks.
The father of six had been an imam at the An Noor mosque from 2005 to 2011, and is believed to have attended protests against the Assad regime outside the Syrian embassy in London in 2012.
In 1982, he claimed he was forced to flee Syria after being sentenced to death for photographing damage in his home city of Hama following government suppression of a rebellion.
A 61-year-old man held in connection with the murder has also been arrested over terrorism acts.
A 53-year-old woman has been arrested on suspicion of terror acts in connection with the death.
