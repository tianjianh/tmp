Energy firm Inazin said the site at Branston, near Lincoln, will produce about 20 megawatts, enough to power up to 3,600 homes.
Work is expected to start in the coming weeks with the site being connected to the grid in March next year.
A spokesman for Inazin said they had planned for a larger facility but local power infrastructure could not cope.
North Kesteven District Council heard the site will have a lifespan of about 30 years after which it will revert to farm land.
