Second quarter goals from Conor Johnston and Ciaran Clarke helped the Saffrons to a commanding 11-point lead at the break, 2-12 to 0-7.
The same players found the net in the second half as Antrim won by 20 points.
Carlow will be the Saffrons' opposition in the decider after they defeated neighbours Wicklow by 0-24 to 2-8.
Clarke netted his second inside a minute of the re-start, with Johnston completing his goal double seven minutes from the end.
Antrim and twice winners Carlow will contest the final for the first time since 2006.
Meanwhile, hurling's third-tier Nicky Rackard Cup final will be an all-Ulster affair between Armagh and Derry.
The Oak Leafers booked their place in the decider for the first time in 11 years, with a 6-17 to 1-12 demolition of Monaghan in Inniskeen
The sides were tied twice in the opening 12 minutes, but a 14th-minute Alan Grant score handed the visitors a lead they would not relinquish.
Goals from Brian Cassidy and Mehaul McGrath helped Derry to a 2-7 to 0-5 interval lead, with further goals from Brendan Rodgers (3) and Ruairi Convery in the second half.
Tadhg Campbell netted for Monaghan, but Trevor Hilliard's side came out second best by some margin.
Monaghan finished the game with 14 players, following the dismissal of Sean Leonard for a second yellow card.
Davy Carvill fired 1-11 for Armagh in their 2-25 to 1-14 win over Tyrone in Carrickmore.
Armagh led by 1-8 to 0-0 early on, with Carvill bringing his tally to 1-5, before Conor Grogan opened the hosts account.
Armagh led by 1-13 to 0-5 at half-time, but Tyrone worked hard, in no small part to the work of Damien Casey from frees and play.
A Bryan McGurk goal ensured a 1-17 to 1-8 score-line, but Armagh finished strongly with the final four points, with Conor Corvan, Ryan and Dean Gaffney, and Carvill on target late on to book their place in the decider for the third year in succession.
