Kleber Da Silva Ramos, 30, took part in the men's Olympic road race on 6 August but failed to finish.
Cycling's world governing body, the UCI, says he failed a Pre-Olympics test on 31 July and is suspended until a ruling is made on his case.
On Friday, the Court of Arbitration for Sport announced three athletes failed tests - a Chinese swimmer, a Bulgarian runner and a Polish weightlifter.
China's Chen Xinyi, 18, was the first swimmer to fail a doping test at the Rio Olympics and has accepted a provisional suspension while her result is investigated.
Bulgarian runner Silvia Danekova, 33, a 3,000m steeplechase athlete, tested positive for banned blood booster EPO in a doping control conducted a few days after her arrival in Brazil on 26 July.
Her case has already gone before the Court of Arbitration for Sport's anti-doping panel in Rio, which declared her "ineligible to compete".
Athletics' governing body, the IAAF, will now decide her punishment.
Poland's London 2012 Olympic weightlifting champion Adrian Zielinski has joined brother Tomasz in being sent home from Rio 2016 after testing positive for for nandrolene at the Polish Championships in July.
The Polish Weightlifting Federation said the 27-year-old has a legal right to have his B sample tested.
His 25-year-old brother Tomasz was sent home from Brazil on Tuesday.
