The 1989 World Tour Live can be streamed from 20 December. It is not available to buy but it is free for streaming for Apple Music subscribers.
Swift criticised Apple Music in June for not paying artists during its free, three-month trial launch.
She said she was withholding her 1989 album because of Apple's stance. The company then did a u-turn.
Since then, Apple Music has been the only streaming platform where 1989 is available.
The concert video features Swift's show in Sydney, Australia, on 28 November.
It will also include appearances from other musicians and celebrities who surprised fans on the tour, including Justin Timberlake, Mick Jagger and Kobe Bryant.
In an interview with Zane Lowe on Apple Music's Beats 1 Radio, Swift spoke about her relationship with the streaming service.
"I'm sure there are better ways to introduce yourself than to say: 'This is what I'm upset about, please think about our industry.' It got more attention than I thought it would because I'd been echoing those sentiments for years," she told Lowe.
"And then I was struck with this overwhelming sense of fear. Like, are they going to turn my phone off? Are they going to turn the video camera on? Are they watching me right now? Am I going to wake up tomorrow and all of my music will be off of iTunes?'' she added. "Like absolute terror hit.''
Swift said Apple "had shown such humility in what they did ... so that's how we get to (here)."
1989 has sold more than five million copies and earned Swift seven Grammy nominations, including album of the year.
