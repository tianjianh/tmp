[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Surrey were indebted to Steven Davies and Tom Curran's seventh-wicket century partnership as Nottinghamshire's bowlers kept them in check.

Davies (82) and Curran (52) added 112 to rescue their side from 172-6 after winning the toss and electing to bat.
But both were out in successive balls to Jake Ball and Brett Hutton late on.
England Test hopeful Ball earlier had Rory Burns and Ben Foakes caught behind to finish day one with 3-69, while Surrey's Arun Harinath also made 73.
Bottom-of-the-table Surrey started play still searching for a first Championship win of the season, 19 points behind seventh-placed Nottinghamshire.
Surrey opener Harinath rebuilt after the early loss of Burns, but lost the support of Kumar Sangakkara when Steven Mullaney found a way through the Sri Lankan's defences.
Harry Gurney was one of six Nottinghamshire bowlers to claim a wicket when he trapped Zafar Ansari without scoring to leave Surrey in strife on 138-5.
Foakes (22) also failed to settle at the crease before Davies and Curran's efforts guided them to two batting bonus points.
Surrey batsman Steven Davies told BBC Radio London:
"The last few months we've found this division very tough. I think we need to play some smarter cricket at times and today, we maybe missed out on some opportunities.
"Arun Harinath played well and it was obviously a nice partnership between myself and Tom Curran, but there's still a long way to go for us.
"Unfortunately, we lost both of us in the space of two balls, which is not ideal, but that's the game.
"I felt a lot better today. It was nice to get away from the frantic nature of T20 cricket and just knuckle down and bat time.
"I was pleased with the way I played. But, in that situation, I need to go on and make a big score."
