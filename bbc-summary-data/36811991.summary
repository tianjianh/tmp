PM Theresa May starts ministerial appointments

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
PM Theresa May has announced her first junior ministerial appointments as she continues to shape her administration.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Anna Soubry, business minister and prominent Remain campaigner, and pensions minister Baroness Altmann have left the government, No 10 said.
Meanwhile, Penny Mordaunt becomes a minister in the Department for Work and Pensions and Mike Penning will be a minister at the Ministry of Defence.
Ms Soubry tweeted to say she had handed in her resignation earlier on Friday.
Baroness Altmann was made a peer and appointed minister for pensions by David Cameron in 2015 after a carving a career out of fighting for older people's rights.
In a resignation letter to Mrs May, Baroness Altmann said that her efforts to improve pensions policy over the past year had been thwarted by "short-term political considerations".
She called for more help for women forced to work longer by the government's decision to raise their retirement age.
"I am not convinced the government adequately addressed the hardship facing women who have had their state pension age increased at relatively short notice," she said.
And she said that to tackle the "crisis" in social care funding, the government should develop a "one nation" lifetime pension.
The current "ineffective and complex" system for encouraging people to save for their retirement through tax breaks "disproportionately" favours the wealthy and leaves lower earners "seriously disadvantaged", she said.
Other people to leave the government include Ed Vaizey, culture minister in former Prime Minister David Cameron's administration, who tweeted to say he would be supporting from the back benches.
Meanwhile, Ms Mordaunt, who was previously an Armed Forces minister and a vocal Brexit supporter, made headlines earlier in the year when she said that it was "very likely" Turkey would join the European Union in the next eight years.
And Mr Penning, who has served alongside Mrs May at the Home Office, was previously a policing minister.
Other ministerial appointments include:
On Thursday Mrs May completed appointing her cabinet, in what was seen as a major departure from the top team put together by her predecessor David Cameron.
George Osborne, Michael Gove, John Whittingdale, Nicky Morgan and Oliver Letwin were all sacked, meanwhile Liz Truss became justice secretary, Justine Greening took over at education and Tory leadership contender Andrea Leadsom was promoted to environment secretary.
Former London mayor, and face of the Leave campaign Boris Johnson, became foreign secretary, and Philip Hammond was made chancellor.
Amber Rudd - formerly the energy secretary - took over Mrs May's former role as home secretary.
Eurosceptic David Davis, meanwhile, took charge of negotiating Britain's exit from the European Union, in the newly-created post of Brexit secretary.
Former minister Liam Fox returned to the government to head the newly created Department for International Trade.
