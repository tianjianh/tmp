The recall applies to boxes sold in the US, Puerto Rico and some Caribbean and South American countries.
"We deeply apologize to the consumers we have disappointed," Kraft said in a statement.
A full list of the recalled products is available on its website.
Kraft said that 242,000 cases of 7.25oz boxes were being recalled, and that they were sold in packages of three, four and five boxes.
It said it had received eight consumer complaints but no reported injuries as a result of the metal pieces.
This is Kraft's second product recall in six months.  In August, it recalled about 7,700 cases of some varieties of its Kraft American singles cheese product after an ingredient was stored improperly.
