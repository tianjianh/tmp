[SN]TITLE[SN]
Anthony Grainger inquiry: Police not immune from prosecution

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Police officers who give evidence to an inquiry into the death of an unarmed man will not be immune from criminal prosecution, the Attorney General said.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Anthony Grainger was shot in the chest during a Greater Manchester Police (GMP) operation in Cheshire in 2012.
Public inquiry lead Judge Thomas Teague QC suggested evidence given in the inquiry by witnesses should not be used in any prosecution against them.
But Attorney General Jeremy Wright said that would not be appropriate.
Mr Grainger, 36 and of Bolton, died during the operation in Culceth.
The inquiry into his death, due to start on 16 January 2017, will look at the police operation, the decision to send armed officers, and any failures in gathering intelligence.
The partner, brother, mother and stepfather of Mr Grainger, along with "GMP officer Q9", have been named as "core participants".
Judge Teague has previously said it was the "utmost public concern" when an unarmed person was shot dead by police.
He said some evidence may not be made available to the public, due to the "nature of the documentation".
[CORRECTION - 1 December 2016: The original version of this story, published at 10:03 GMT on 26 December, stated "Judge Thomas Teague QC, leading the public inquiry, had asked for immunity for those giving evidence". This is incorrect - the judge instead asked that evidence provided by witnesses should not be used against witnesses in any future proceedings.]
