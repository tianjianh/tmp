Sheffield axe attacker 'did not intend to kill' PC, court hears

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man who attacked a policewoman with an axe did not intend to kill her or cause serious harm, a court has heard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
PC Lisa Bates was left with with one of her fingers hanging off, a deep wound to the top of her head, a fractured skull and a smashed ankle.
Nathan Sumner, 35, chased her, shouting "I'm gonna kill you", when she and a colleague tried to arrest him at his Sheffield flat, the court heard.
He admits causing the officer grievous bodily harm.

Mr Sumner, of Plowright Close, denies attempting to murder PC Bates and an alternative count of causing her grievous bodily harm with intent.
After she fell, Mr Sumner hit the officer with the axe a number of times as she lay on the floor, Sheffield Crown Court heard.
An officer responding to her plight heard a "blood-curdling scream" over his radio as he went to the Gleadless area in the city on 13 April, said prosecutor Sam Green QC.
The jury was shown CCTV footage of Mr Sumner's eventual arrest in a nearby Co-op store by police who brought him to the ground with a Taser.
He told one shop worker: "I've cut two people's heads off with an axe and you are next, you crazy bitch," said Mr Green.
More footage, shot by an officer on his phone and seen by the jury, showed Mr Sumner ranting at the officers.
David Brookes, defending, said it was agreed Mr Sumner was suffering from a psychotic episode at the time.
He told the jurors they would have to decide whether Mr Sumner really did mean to seriously hurt or even kill PC Bates.
The trial continues.
