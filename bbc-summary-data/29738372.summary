The 26-year-old featured 11 times last season for the Super League champions but was not offered a new contract.
Wheeler came through the academy at Saints and his versatility has seen him feature at centre and wing.
"I've been a big admirer of Gary's ability for some time. He's extremely versatile and will add real depth to the squad," said head coach Tony Smith.
"At times he's had some bad luck with injuries but we've assessed the situation and look forward to him contributing to the 2015 season."
