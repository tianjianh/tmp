[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man has pleaded guilty to murdering a west Belfast boxer in May 2015.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Eamonn Magee Jr, 22, died from stab wounds he sustained to the chest and stomach in Twinbrook in the city.
Mr Magee was a rising star in the boxing world, hoping to follow in the footsteps of his father Eamonn, a former welterweight champion.
Turkish national Orhan Koca, 34, of no fixed abode, admitted the murder charge at Belfast Crown Court on Tuesday, just as his trial was about to begin.
He will be sentenced in May.
Mr Magee Jr was at a friend's house in Summerhill Park in Twinbrook in the early hours of 30 May 2015 when he was attacked by Koca.
He died a short time later in hospital.
After Koca's guilty plea, a judge told him that he was facing a life sentence.
