"It's absolutely crazy. It's a circus," former world lightweight champion Crolla told BBC Radio 5 live.
"It's almost like Rocky III, when he fought Hulk Hogan. It comes down to money.
"Should a guy who has not had a professional fight be allowed to fight one of the greatest fighters ever? No."
The multi-million fight will be the most lucrative in boxing history.
Crolla also thinks it will be "the biggest sporting upset" should McGregor beat Mayweather.
"I'm a Conor McGregor fan but he has no chance whatsoever, and I think it's absolutely crazy people are giving him the slightest chance.
"I'll go as far as saying it will be the biggest sporting upset of all time if Conor McGregor was to do this. It will be awful for boxing."
