[SN]TITLE[SN]
Scunthorpe United 1-0 Oldham Athletic

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
League One leaders Scunthorpe left it late before breaking stubborn 10-man Oldham's resistance and sealing a 1-0 victory.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Full-back Scott Wiseman made the decisive breakthrough in the 80th minute, his sweetly-struck shot from the edge of the box nestling in the back of the net via the inside of the post.
The story could have been much different had the Latics taken one of three good opportunities that came their way in the opening 45 minutes.
Billy McKay side-footed a great opportunity wide from seven yards when the goal was gaping and Iron keeper Luke Daniels twice thwarted Ryan Flynn after he had got in behind the defence.
Scunthorpe improved greatly after the break and were unlucky not to go in front much earlier.
Kevin van Veen thought he had broken the deadlock with a shot that cannoned down off the stanchion before being cleared and seconds later Tom Hopper was flagged offside after adding the finishing touch to a free-kick.
It did not matter though as, after Latics midfielder Paul Green had been sent off for his second booking in the space of seven minutes, Wiseman fired home.
