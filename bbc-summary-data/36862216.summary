North Lanarkshire Council unanimously approved plans for a new neighbourhood centre in Westfield.
It will include seven shops such as M&S Simply Food, Aldi and Home Bargains, as well as a pub, a petrol station and a  drive-through coffee shop. There wil also be 600 car parking spaces.
A further 50 jobs will be created for the construction phase.
The centre will be built by developers L&S Broadwood on a brownfield site near Broadwood Stadium.
It is hoped construction will begin later this year.
Starbucks are said to be in advanced negotiations over the lease of the coffee shop. The developers are also in discussions with potential tenants for the remaining four retail units, the pub and the petrol station.
Development director Bryan Wilson said: "We believe this local neighbourhood centre will be a tremendous asset for the people living on the other side of the M80 who currently have very few local amenities.
"It will give them top High Street brands on their doorstep and provide a real focus for their community".
"We are grateful to the members of the planning committee for giving us the green light for our proposals. We hope to have shovels in the ground later this year, with a view to start trading in around 18 months time".
