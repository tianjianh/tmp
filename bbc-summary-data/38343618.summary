Rome mayor Virginia Raggi's right-hand man' Raffaele Marra arrested

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A top aide of Rome's new mayor has been arrested on suspicion of corruption, months after the politician was elected promising to clean up local government.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Raffaele Marra was arrested on Friday, as part of an investigation of business deals dating from 2013.
Mr Marra is the head of personnel in city hall and is considered Mayor Virginia Raggi's right-hand man.
Ms Raggi is the populist Five-Star Movement's highest profile elected representative.
The party prides itself on being ethical and having no links to what it sees as a "caste" of sleaze-addicted cronies it says have dominated Italian politics for decades.
But Mr Marra's arrest comes days after Ms Raggi's top environmental adviser resigned following the revelation she was under investigation.
The two investigations, which are not linked, will put pressure on Ms Raggi, whose success is seen as crucial for the Five-Star Movement ahead of national elections.
Mr Marra's case is not linked to any council activity, but offices at the city hall were raided.
