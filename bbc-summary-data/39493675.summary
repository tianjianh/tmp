Andrew Robertson, from Berkshire, was killed in Derby Road in Lenton at about 16:45 BST on Thursday.
The 20-year-old, who was studying biochemistry at the University of Nottingham, was described by his family as "caring" and "very easy going".
Police are investigating the crash, which closed the road for several hours, but no arrests have been made.
In a statement, Mr Robertson's family said: "He was a loving son, grandson, brother, nephew, cousin and boyfriend.
"He had many friends both at university and at home. Words cannot express how much he will be missed and we are extremely saddened by his death.
"Andrew was caring, fun-loving, sociable, supportive and very easy-going. He was a team player who always kept his word and looked out for others."
Nottinghamshire Police has appealed for anyone with dashcam footage of the crash to make contact.
