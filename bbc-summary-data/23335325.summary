The 26-year-old has signed a five-year contract with the French champions, who are backed by Qatar Sports Investments.
Cavani scored 78 league goals in three seasons with Napoli and finished top scorer in Serie A last season.
"The transfer of Edinson Cavani is further proof of the club's ability to attract the best players in the world," said PSG president Nasser Al-Khelaifi.
"The player was seduced by the club's sporting project and is delighted to be joining an ambitious side, impatient to take on new challenges.
"We are especially happy to present such a hugely coveted player of immense talent to our supporters."
The deal means Cavani is the most expensive transfer in French football history, eclipsing the £50m that Monaco are reported to have paid Atletico Madrid for Colombia forward Radamel Falcao.
He will line up alongside Sweden international Zlatan Ibrahimovic, who was named Ligue 1 player of the year after he scored 30 goals in his debut season in France following his £15.7m arrival from AC Milan.
Cavani,  and also linked with Chelsea and Real Madrid, says he joined Laurent Blanc's side to challenge for major honours.
"I'd like to thank everyone who made this transfer possible, it's a great project," Cavani said.
"I'd also like to thank the people in Napoli who went out of their way to make it possible.
"I come here with lots of joy, lots of confidence, lots of hunger and lots of motivation to win major trophies."
