A judge in Connecticut has dismissed a lawsuit brought by relatives of those killed in the mass shooting at Sandy Hook primary school in 2012.

The families said the rifle used by Adam Lanza, 20, in the massacre should not have been publicly available.
They argued the Bushmaster AR-15 rifle was designed for military use.
Judge Barbara Bellis dismissed the case on the grounds that federal law prevents legal action against gun manufacturers.
Twenty children and six adults were killed in the attack.
The 54-page decision announced on Friday afternoon dismissed the case against gun maker Remington Outdoor Company, the dealer, Camfour Inc, and the company that owned the gun store, Riverview Sales, where Adam Lanza's mother bought the assault rifle.
The families of 10 victims had claimed the sellers understood that civilians were unfit to operate the rifle and that they ignored the threat it presented to those without military training.
