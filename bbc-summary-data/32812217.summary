[SN]TITLE[SN]
Met officer Andrew Ott jailed for London student protest assault

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A Met Police officer who used "gratuitous and unnecessary violence" when a student's tooth was knocked out during a protest has been jailed.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
PC Andrew Ott struck William Horner with a "full force blow" using his shield at a tuition fees protest in Westminster during 2010.
He was jailed for eight months after being convicted of causing actual bodily harm at Southwark Crown Court.
Judge Jeffrey Pegden said Ott, 36, from Kent, had abused his power.
He told Ott: "This offence was committed in a sterile area, in relative darkness, when you had the victim cornered and no violence was necessary at all.
"You hit him with a full force blow to his face with your shield.
"That was wholly gratuitous, unnecessary violence, and I have considered the stress on William Horner over the last few years."
Mr Horner, then aged 20, had been trying to break free from a kettled area when he was struck.
Ott, from Rochester, had been heard talking about "getting" the protesters and threatening violence after being taped on his personal recording device, jurors were told.
He was heard swearing about the attack and saying "I've had enough".
Ott, and two other officers PC Calvin Lindsay, 31, from east London, and PC Thomas Barnes, 31, from Kent, were cleared of perverting the course of justice.
