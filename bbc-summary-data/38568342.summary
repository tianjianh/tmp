[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Wycombe Wanderers chairman Andrew Howard hopes they take the underdog mantle of non-league Stourbridge into their FA Cup tie at Tottenham.

The League Two side beat seventh-tier Stourbridge 2-1 in round three to set up a match at the Premier League side.
"Stourbridge were brilliant - they came with the passion of the underdog and that was their Wembley," said Howard.
"We are the Stourbridge of round four. The whole country wanted Stourbridge to win, now I hope everyone wants us to."
The Chairboys, fifth in the table, are owned by their fans, and do not have a budget big enough to support a 22-man squad, leaving them unable to train with 11 versus 11.
They will be appearing in the fourth round for only the second time in their 130-year history.
The previous time they got this far, they went all the way to the semi-final in 2001, but Howard said the ticket sales and potential TV money from the Spurs game could have an impact on a club hoping to achieve promotion to League One.
"We're ranked the third-lowest with squad funding in the Football League. We struggle to compete with the big squads," said Howard.
"This is the first time in two and a half years in a January transfer window where we can ask 'Are there any players we can bring in?'"
Wycombe's trip to Tottenham will take place on the weekend of 28-29 January, and it will be the first time they have played at White Hart Lane.
