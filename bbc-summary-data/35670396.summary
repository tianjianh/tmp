The Olympic long jump champion, 29, has withdrawn from the Sheffield meeting after suffering a chest infection.
He was also forced to miss last Saturday's Glasgow Indoor Grand Prix with a small muscle tear.
"Sadly I won't be jumping in Sheffield this weekend," Rutherford said.
"I've had a chest infection on top of the small injury so it's a no-go, but the aim is still the World Indoors.
"It took two jumps to break the British indoor record and I'm aiming for all six jumps in Portland."
Rutherford, who is also current World, European and Commonwealth champion, jumped 8.26 metres in Albuquerque earlier this month and lies second in the world rankings.
The World Indoors take place in Portland, Oregon, from 17-20 March.
