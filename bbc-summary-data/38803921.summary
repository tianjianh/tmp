Paul Massey: 'Mr Big murder' still being investigated

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Detectives are still gathering evidence into the death of a convicted criminal once branded "Mr Big", a pre-inquest hearing has heard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Paul Massey was shot five times outside his Salford home on 26 July 2015 in what police believe to be a gang feud.
No-one has been arrested over the killing of the 55-year-old security boss, who was jailed for 14 years in 1999 for stabbing a man outside a club.
A full inquest is expected after police complete their criminal investigation.
The victim's partner, eight other members of his family and detectives attended Bolton Coroner's Court for a brief pre-inquest hearing.
Jennifer Leeming, senior coroner for Manchester West, asked the senior officer in the case: "I understand these inquiries, the inquiries touching on the death of Mr Massey, are still active inquiries and I understand that there's reason to suppose that charges will result, is that right?"
Det Supt Howard Millington, of Greater Manchester Police, replied: "That's right. We are still providing evidence to the CPS (Crown Prosecution Service)."
Massey was dubbed Mr Big by the late Salford councillor Joe Burrows at a town hall meeting to discuss civil disturbances in 1992.
He was jailed in 1999 for 14 years after he stabbed a man in the groin outside a club in Manchester, severing an artery.
He was a well-known figure in his home city of Salford and had been involved with security firms operating in Manchester and beyond.
A Â£50,000 reward is still on offer for information leading to the arrest and conviction of the killers.
A further pre-inquest hearing was scheduled for 17 May.
