Johnny McNicholl crossed early into his Scarlets debut, and Werner Kruger extended the hosts' lead.
Richardt Strauss cut the deficit but Leinster had Barry Daly sent off for a high tackle on Aled Thomas.
Will Boyde and Ryan Elias put Scarlets into what looked to be a comfortable lead but a late Andrew Porter try salvaged a bonus point for Leinster.
Scarlets, who were without Wales players Samson Lee, Ken Owens, Scott Williams, Jonathan Davies, Gareth Davies and Liam Williams, move up to fourth, while Leinster remain top despite the defeat.
McNicholl, who joined Scarlets from New Zealand Super Rugby side Crusaders, scored his first try for the region inside the opening 10 minutes.
After Leinster's Mike McCarthy was sent to the sin-bin, Scarlets made their advantage count as Kruger drove the ball over to extend their lead.
The visitors were made to pay further when Steff Evans kept the ball alive and rewarded Scarlets' perseverance as he touched down just before McCarthy returned.
A frustrating period for Leinster continued when, just moments after the restart, Daly was red-carded for a dangerous tackle on Thomas.
Two minutes later, Boyde caught Leinster's defence open and sealed Scarlets' bonus point with the majority of the second half still to play.
There was late drama, however, as Adam Byrne and Tom Daly got on the scoreboard for Leinster, who ensured they did not leave empty-handed as Porter touched down with a late try.
