Public 'acutely aware' of state surveillance, study finds

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
People in the UK are increasingly concerned about how information about them is gathered, Cardiff and Oxford university researchers have said.

They said people were "acutely aware" of online surveillance by government,  companies and also their peers.
The findings follow plans by UK ministers for new laws to help police and agencies monitor online threats.
The academics are halfway through an 18-month research project into digital citizenship and state surveillance.
They presented preliminary findings from focus groups, interviews with activists and opinion poll analysis at a conference on surveillance at Cardiff University.
Cardiff University's Lina Dencik said: "Most people don't like that this is happening, and will try and monitor their online behaviour accordingly, but also feel powerless to do much about it."
She added: "People want to know why and how their personal data is being collected and used, and what legal safeguards exist.
"This is central at a time when one of the first acts of the newly-elected Conservative government has been to increase intelligence agencies' surveillance powers, while at the same time withholding the publication of annual transparency reports on the security services as initiated under the coalition government."
The conference also heard from a lawyer representing the former CIA contractor and whistleblower Edward Snowden.
Ben Wizner said the Snowden leak had led to journalists, politicians and courts in the US taking a tougher stance against granting additional surveillance powers to the intelligence agencies.
But he said that in some countries, such as France, Canada and Australia, recent terror attacks had been "exploited".
"What we see across the West is that politicians who say our existing institutions are strong enough to deal with this, we don't need to change our laws, are dismissed as weak and naive and politicians who say this is a war on terror, this is a new kind of threat, the greatest kind of threat we face are extolled as hard-nosed warriors," he said.
Although the US authorities would like Snowden - who remains in Russia - to plead guilty, he said his popularity around the world meant "they don't relish the idea of grabbing him and prosecuting him".
The Home Office has been asked to comment.
The two-day conference, at the university's School of Journalism, Media and Cultural Studies, is being held as part of the Digital Citizenship and Surveillance Society  research project.
