NHS to help create 'healthy new towns'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Ten new housing developments in England are to be built with healthy living in mind, under an NHS scheme.

Clinicians, designers and technology experts will work together to create the "healthy new towns".
Plans include homes with virtual access to GP services, safe green spaces to play and fast-food-free zones around schools.
The money to build the developments will come from council budgets and private partners rather than the NHS.
The places earmarked to test the ideas include existing villages in the South West, London and the North West and two new developments in Cambridgeshire and Darlington.
Some of the developments are already being built, but others will not be completed until 2030.
Simon Stevens, the head of NHS England, said a much-needed push to kick-start affordable housing across England had created a "golden opportunity" for the NHS to help town planners promote health and keep people living independently.
"As these new neighbourhoods and towns are built, we'll kick ourselves if in 10 years' time we look back having missed the opportunity to 'design out' the obesogenic environment, and 'design in' health and wellbeing," he said.
"We want children to have places where they want to play with friends and can safely walk or cycle to school - rather than just exercising their fingers on video games."
