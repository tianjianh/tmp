Goalkeeper Michael McGovern says his heroics in helping Northern Ireland reach the last 16 at Euro 2016 will do his search for a club deal "no harm".

McGovern, 31, is out of contract at Hamilton Academical but looks likely to attract interest from bigger clubs following his display against Germany.
The Enniskillen man's series of saves restricted the Germans to a 1-0 win as Northern Ireland reached the last 16.
"I'm sure the club side of things will take care of itself," said McGovern.
"Playing well last night will have done me no harm either."

Speaking on BBC Radio Ulster on Wednesday morning, McGovern added that there was a "bit of interest" in his services before his heroics against the world champions on Tuesday.
McGovern, who didn't make a first-team appearance during his seven years at Celtic, stopped eight German goal attempts in a display reminiscent of the days when the great Pat Jennings wore the Northern Ireland jersey.
"Hamilton are keen to keep me as well," added McGovern, who has also has spells with other Scottish clubs Stranraer, St Johnstone, Dundee United, Ross County and Falkirk.
"I've not really spoken to my agent too much. I'm concentrating on the Euros."
McGovern was still receiving plaudits on Wednesday, with former Germany and Arsenal keeper Jens Lehmann among those to laud the Northern Ireland keeper's display against the world champions.
Lehmann praised McGovern's bravery in making the saves, and joked that a move to the Bundesliga could be on the cards, when saying: "Does he speak German?"
McGovern described such praise "as a big honour", adding that his main challenge on Tuesday had been mental rather than physical.
"It was quite intense and you had to be switched on at all times," he said.

"The mental side of things was probably the hardest thing.
"I was hoping a 1-0 defeat would be enough to get us through and eventually it was.
"If I had played well and we had not got through, it wouldn't have mattered as much. I'm delighted for the team and the manager."
McGovern also hailed the backing from Northern Ireland's fans whose cacophony of noise at the Parc des Princes on Tuesday night earned widespread acclaim.
He said: "The fans were incredible. Even against Poland when we didn't play to our best, they backed us all the way.
"They are an absolute credit to the country with the way they have behaved and the way they back us."
