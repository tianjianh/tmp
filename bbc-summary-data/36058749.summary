ScotRail guards to be balloted by RMT on strike action

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Scotrail guards who are members of the RMT union are to be balloted on industrial action in a row over driver-only trains.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The union is opposed to plans to increase the number of driver-only services, arguing that guards should be in control of operating doors.
Scotrail said no formal proposals had been put forward and it would work with the RMT to try to find a way forward.
The ballot was announced after talks failed to resolve the dispute.
RMT general secretary Mick Cash said: "Any extension of driver-only operation is a clear attack on our members' hard-earned terms and conditions.
"RMT members should not have to face the risk of their role and responsibilities being reduced and undermined.
"There is also a very real threat to passengers of watering down and wiping out the safety-critical role of the guard on ScotRail services. That is a lethal gamble with basic rail safety."
He added: "RMT is in no doubt that our members will stand together and demonstrate the strength of feeling across the ScotRail network during this dispute. The union remains available for further talks."
Phil Verster, managing director of the ScotRail Alliance, said: "We have been informed by the RMT that they intend to ballot members for industrial action regarding driver-controlled operation.
"No formal proposals have taken place, and we are still at the stage of considering all options.
"We are keen to continue working with the RMT to find a constructive way forward as soon as possible, and one which will not affect our customers."
