The cause of the accident is being investigated by police in the city, a council spokeswoman confirmed.
Mr Bruschini said: "A sweet angel was here just to enjoy his time and suddenly a perfect vacation day has turned into tragedy.
"The city and all the population of Anzio is near to the family in this sorrowful moment."
