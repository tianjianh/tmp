[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Scotland Yard said he faced six charges of indecent assault, of which three allegedly involved girls aged under 16 between 1991 and 1996, and two allegations of sexual assault.
Mr Fox, 53, of Fulham, is due before Westminster magistrates on 16 April.
His lawyer said he "categorically denies each and every allegation that has been made against him".
Anthony Burton said it would be inappropriate for his client to say anything else.
Mr Fox is charged with one indecent assault on a girl aged under 14 and two indecent assaults on a girl aged under 16.
He is also charged with four indecent assaults on a female over 16 and two sexual assaults on a female which are alleged to have taken place between 2003 and 2014.
He was first arrested on 30 September, after the Metropolitan Police said four allegations of sexual assault had been made.
A second arrest was made in December 2014 for a further three allegations of sexual assaults.
Mr Fox, who uses the nicknames Dr Fox and Foxy, began his career in local radio before moving to Radio Luxembourg and then London's Capital Radio in the late 1980s.
In 1993 he landed the job of presenting the Sunday afternoon Network Chart Show, later known as the Pepsi chart.
His big TV break was as a judge on ITV talent show Pop Idol between 2001 and 2003 alongside Simon Cowell, Pete Waterman, and Nicki Chapman.
He left Capital in 2005 and joined Magic 105.4, where he presents the breakfast show, Foxy in the Morning. He is currently not hosting the show.
His arrest is not part of  Operation Yewtree, which was set up in the wake of revelations about BBC presenter Jimmy Savile.
