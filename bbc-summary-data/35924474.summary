The Land Registry said that Slough, where the trains will stop, saw a 19% rise in prices in the year to February, the biggest increase in the country.
The Elizabeth Line, as it has been named, will also run through Hillingdon, where property prices jumped 17.1%.
To the east of London, prices rose by 16.9% in Havering, also on the line.
Other nearby local authority areas also saw big increases, including Thurrock, where the figure was 17.2%, and Barking and Dagenham, which saw a 16% rise.
In Slough, made famous by Sir John Betjeman's poem about the town, as well as the sitcom The Office, prices jumped by 2.1% between January and February alone.
The Elizabeth Line is due to open between Liverpool Street and Shenfield in May next year.
However full services through to Reading will not operate until December 2019.
Across England and Wales as a whole, house prices went up by 6.1% in the year to February, bringing the average price of a house or flat to Â£190,275.
