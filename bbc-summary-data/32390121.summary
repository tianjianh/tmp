Election 2015: Sir John Major warns of Labour-SNP deal

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Former Prime Minister John Major is to enter the election campaign and claim that a Labour government propped up by the SNP would be a "recipe for mayhem".

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Sir John will use a speech in the Midlands to say a Labour-SNP government would mean families paying with "higher taxes, more debts and fewer jobs".
He will say a future Labour government would be subjected to a "daily dose of blackmail" from the nationalists.
But Ed Miliband told the BBC "that ain't going to happen".
With 16 days to polling day, Sir John will say that, in practice, Mr Miliband would be forced to agree to the nationalists' demands or face the collapse of his government.
"If Labour were to accept an offer of support from the SNP, it could put the country on course to a government held to ransom on a vote-by-vote basis," he is expected to say.
"Labour would be in hock to a party that - slowly but surely - will push them ever further to the left. And who would pay the price for this? We all would. We would all pay for the SNP's ransom in our daily lives - through higher taxes, fewer jobs, and more and more debt.
"This is a recipe for mayhem. At the very moment our country needs a strong and stable government, we risk a weak and unstable one - pushed to the left by its allies, and open to a daily dose of political blackmail."
But interviewed by Evan Davis on the BBC, Mr Miliband rejected claims that the SNP would "call the shots" in the event of a hung parliament.
"That ain't going to happen; that ain't going to happen," he said.

Policy guide: Where the parties stand
Launching her party's manifesto in Edinburgh on Monday, SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon sought to allay the fears of some English voters, insisting they would act "responsibly and constructively" in the interests of the whole of the UK.
Recent polls all point towards there being a hung parliament after 7 May, and suggest the SNP could be the third largest party and crucially hold the balance of power.
As a consequence of this, the "threat" of an SNP link-up with Labour has emerged as a major Conservative line of attack in the election campaign.
But senior Tory peer Lord Forsyth has suggested that this tactic of building up the SNP as a way of damaging the Labour party in Scotland could be playing a "short term and dangerous" game that threatens the future of the UK.
"We've had the dilemma for Conservatives, which is they want to be the largest party at Westminster and therefore some see the fact that the nationalists are going to take seats in Scotland will be helpful," he told the Guardian.
"But that is a short-term and dangerous view which threatens the integrity of our country."
But despite this Sir John Major will say that the SNP's "driving ambition" is an independent Scotland, and it would use its position to demand policies that favour Scotland at the expense of the rest of the UK.
"That is no way to run a country. And nor is it remotely fair to England, Wales and Northern Ireland," he will say.
Meanwhile, former Labour minister and London mayoral contender David Lammy told ITV that his party could "do business" with the SNP after the election.
