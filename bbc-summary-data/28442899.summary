[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Building developer Costain has been fined more than £500,000 for health and safety breaches that led to the death of a building site supervisor.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Mark Williams, 41, from Oxfordshire, was killed when a telehandler machine toppled at a shopping centre development in Newbury in July 2011.
A trial at Reading Crown Court heard he had to make too many short turns with the machine in a crowded area.
Mr Williams' family said he had complained about working conditions.
Costain was found guilty of failure to ensure the health, safety and welfare of a worker.
The Maidenhead-based company was fined £525,000 having also been found guilty of exposing another employee to a risk of harm and of failing to carry out proper risk assessments.
Passing sentence Judge Angela Morris said Costain fell short of its obligations and that lessons had not been learnt from two previous incidents involving lifting equipment.
Mr Williams, from Nuneham Courtenay in Oxfordshire, had been using the telehandler to lift tiles at the Parkway Shopping Centre development when he was killed.
During the trial in March, Reading Crown Court heard Mr Williams had complained about a small, crowded working area the day before.
Mr Williams' family said they would pursue a claim for compensation against the company after the six-week appeal period lapses.
In a statement delivered after the verdict, the family said they had mixed feelings about the result, adding that he was "let down" by Costain and [contractor] Attleys Roofing.
"The day before he died, he told Costain in a meeting that 'someone was going to get killed'.
"Sadly for us, someone did get killed - him," it said.
