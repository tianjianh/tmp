The car, in Glencaw Park in the Galliagh area of the city, was set on fire at about 23:45 GMT on Wednesday evening.
It is believed a petrol bomb was used in the attack. No-one was injured.
Three men, dressed in balaclavas and dark jackets, were seen running away from the car after it was set alight.
The family were in the house at the time with their four children.
The children's aunt said her brother chased the men but was not able to catch them.
"He just wants to know why they did it," she said. "That's the only thing that is really bothering him.
"He would like them to approach him and tell him why they did it with the children in the house.
"We're not going to move out. We want to stay and get it sorted out."
She added that the children were frightened after the incident.
"The oldest one knows everything that's going on, she's terrified to stay in the house now," she said.
"She was asking everything about the police being involved. She's only six years old.
"It's not as if we could have hid it from her because she was awakened by all the noise and banging."
SDLP councillor Brian Tierney said the family were "shocked and distraught" by the attack.
The police have appealed for information.
