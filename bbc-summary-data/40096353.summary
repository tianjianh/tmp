Police believe Luke Campbell-Tapson may have taken MDMA at a youth disco held at Vivid nightclub in Ilfracombe.
The teenager was taken to North Devon District Hospital where he died in the early hours of Saturday.
Supt Toby Davies said Luke, from South Molton, was a "popular teenager". An investigation into his death has been launched.

"At this time the cause of death is unknown and officers are following up a number of lines of enquiry," Supt Davies said.
"One of those lines of enquiry relates to the possible consumption of a controlled substance, believed to be MDMA tablets."
A joint statement from Vivid nightclub and event hosts 2Filthy said they "would like to express their deepest sympathies and condolences to the family of Luke Campbell-Tapson who tragically passed away".
They added: "Vivid would like to make it clear that we take a zero tolerance stance towards drugs at all of our events."
Two young adults were admitted to Derriford Hospital in Plymouth after taking a recreational drug, also believed to be MDMA, at a house party on the same night.
Both remain in hospital, with one in a serious condition.
Police say there is no evidence to link the Plymouth and Ilfracombe incidents.
