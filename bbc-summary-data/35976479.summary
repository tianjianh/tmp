NI Assembly election: UKIP to expose Stormont 'fudge and failures'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The UK Independence Party has said it will expose the fudges and failures of what it described as "the cosy coalition club" at Stormont.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The party, which is standing 13 candidates in the May assembly election, launched its manifesto on Wednesday.
UKIP criticised last November's Fresh Start deal between the DUP, Sinn FÃ©in and the British and Irish governments as more of the same.
It said it would provide a true opposition without any special official status.
The UKIP manifesto expresses concern over the threat from militant Islamists and calls for a tightening of border security.
Other UKIP policies include abolishing tuition fees for students taking science degrees and backing the development of shale gas.
The UKIP leader in Northern Ireland, David McNarry, is retiring from the assembly, but is still campaigning in what he jokingly referred to as his role as a football team manager.
"I see myself as UKIP's Michael O'Neill [Northern Ireland football manager]," Mr McNarry said.
"This is my team, and Michael took his team to the Euros. I am taking this team to Stormont."
Mr McNarry said voters should pick UKIP because they "are not in anyone's pocket".
"UKIP aren't going to go into a coalition with Sinn FÃ©in or pretend the next 10 or 15 years will be laid out by the DUP and Sinn FÃ©in coalition in perpetuity," he said.
"UKIP are going to be the voice of the people and challenge the nonsense taking place at Stormont."
