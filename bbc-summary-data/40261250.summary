The 20-year-old came through the Tigers' youth system but was out of contract this summer.
He played 20 games during second half of last season on loan at Accrington Stanley where he scored once.
"They are a really ambitious club and the facilities are second to none. I'm very ambitious and I want to come here and improve myself," Rodgers said.
Rodgers is the second new signing at Fleetwood this summer following the arrival of Huddersfield Town midfielder Kyle Dempsey.
