The BBC's Price of Football, the biggest study of its kind in Europe and now in its sixth year, looked at more than 1,000 ticket prices at 223 clubs.
The average prices in all four ticket categories we analysed in both tiers of the WSL have gone up.
However, the women's league as a whole worked out cheapest, with no matchday tickets costing more than £8.
The average price of the cheapest season ticket in the top tier is £34.78, while the average price of the most expensive season ticket is £44.44 - a rise of 15% from 2015.
In WSL2, the average price of the cheapest season ticket is £31.56 and the most expensive averages £34.67.
WSL1 side Chelsea Ladies and Oxford United Women in the WSL2 are the only clubs who have frozen or reduced their tickets in all categories.
The cheapest matchday ticket is available at Watford for £3, while you will pay the most at Birmingham City and Bristol City (£8).
Notts County Ladies offer the most expensive season ticket at £75 and the cheapest can be found at Sunderland for £15.
