[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Dozens of customers who paid thousands of pounds for furniture from an online company have been left empty-handed, prompting a probe by Trading Standards.

One woman said, while pregnant, she slept on a mattress on the floor after ordering a bed which did not arrive.
French Rococo Furniture Ltd has been accused of taking £11,000 and not supplying customers with their items.
The BBC has made several attempts to contact company director Cameron Cumming, but he is yet to respond.
Some 30 complaints have been received by Trading Standards, which is investigating the Bristol-based company.
Mr Cumming apparently told them their furniture was in port at Southampton and the delays were not his fault, but the BBC has learned he has not paid his supplier which was holding the goods.
Milly Beddow, 28, from Wales, said she paid £1,700 for a king size bed and bedside tables in June last year and decided to take action five months later.
"I rang him and I said Cameron, you're in breach of contract, I need my furniture - I'm pregnant, sleeping on the floor, I have no wardrobes, I'm living out of bags," she said.
"He offered me furniture for part-time sake. Alarm bells were ringing, if I accepted that I'd be stuck with it. I said I either want my furniture tomorrow or I'd like my money back.
"He asked for my bank details via email and said he would do it there and then. But I haven't had any money back, and no furniture."
BBC reporter Dickon Hooper has spoken to seven customers with similar stories from across the UK, including Belfast, Kent, Rotherham and London.
