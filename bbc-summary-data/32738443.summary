Coronation Street bosses have objected to a planned expansion of Greater Manchester's tram network because they fear the noise could disrupt filming.

ITV have raised an official complaint about Metrolink's plans for a new route - linking central Manchester with the Trafford Centre - which would run past the soap's Media City set in Salford.
They said they would be happier with earlier plans which bypassed the area.
The proposals will be discussed during a public inquiry which begins in July.
A Coronation Street spokesman said managers were "obviously unaware of the plans" when the decision was made to move their studios to Salford.
He added: "Having carried out our own tests, we have serious concerns about the impact on the production of Coronation Street.
"We are in discussions with Transport for Greater Manchester (TFGM) to explore what mitigation it can offer to ensure we are able to continue filming uninterrupted.
"If there are no acceptable solutions, we have called for a return to the original route which we believe achieves the same transport objectives and has no impact on our production."
A TFGM spokesman said tram operators Metrolink and Coronation Street "have a strong track record of working together".
"Metrolink trams can be seen on the show's opening credits and featured in one of the Street's biggest storylines back in 2010," he said.
"We are committed to working with ITV, as we are with all stakeholders along the route, as we progress the scheme."
