[SN]TITLE[SN]
Directors banned for £3m VAT scams

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Three men have been banned from being company directors after carrying out VAT scams worth £3m.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Ex-directors of Leafybug International Ltd, which traded as Furniture Direct in Cardiff, caused losses of £3.04m to HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC).
Ihtesham Ali Hassan, 36, of Cardiff, Clive Thomas, 71, of Llantrisant, and Waseem Mohammed, 44, of Cardiff were banned for 13, 11 and 12 years respectively.
The frauds happened from 2010 to 2012.
Official receiver Ken Beasley said: "Leafybug International Ltd was involved in trading connected with fraudulent VAT schemes which had been costing the UK Exchequer significant amounts of money at the time the frauds were perpetrated."
He added that it was not "victimless misconduct", with "the honest taxpayer" suffering the effects of funding shortages in healthcare and education as a result.
Mr Beasley described Hassan as knowing he was "taking part in a systematic criminal attack on the VAT system".
Thomas failed to make sure that adequate due diligence was conducted by Leafybug and Mohammed failed to disclose to HMRC transactions that had taken place.
