Children from Poland, England, Italy, Netherlands and Ireland, came together for three days of amputee football training from qualified coaches.
Amputee football is a sport played with seven players on each team. Outfield players may have two hands but only one leg, whereas goalkeepers may have two feet but only one hand.
The aim of the academy, run by the European Amputee Football Federation, was to give young footballers with missing limbs a chance to learn new sporting skills.
Leah went to meet some of the footballers taking part.
