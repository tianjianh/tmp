Brown, who joined Saracens from Glasgow Warriors in 2010, has won three Premiership titles and last season's European Champions Cup with the club.
The 34-year-old was capped 64 times by Scotland, captaining the side on 14 occasions from 2012 to 2014.
"I'm forever grateful to be ending my career at a fantastic club like Saracens," he told the club website.
"I'm extremely excited to be moving into a new role within the club's academy next season.
"I've been lucky to have been able to live my dream for 13 years and now I'm privileged to be able to help others do the same."
Saracens are third in the Premiership table with three games to play this season and face Munster in the Champions Cup semi-finals in Dublin on 22 April.
