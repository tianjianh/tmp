Molly-Mae Wotherspoon was attacked by an American pit bull named Bruiser at a house in Daventry, Northamptonshire, in October 2014.
Mother Claire Riley, 23, admitted owning a dangerously out of control dog and grandmother Susan Aucott, 55, admitted being in charge of one.
Both were sentenced at Northampton Crown Court to two years.

Jailing them, judge Mrs Justice Carr told the pair Molly-Mae was savagely attacked by the pit bull in "a tragic and totally avoidable incident".
The court heard Aucott, an alcoholic, was looking after her granddaughter at Riley's former home in Morning Star Road when the dog attacked the baby.
James House, prosecuting, said the pit bull broke free from his cage in the kitchen and opened the door to the lounge to reach baby Molly-Mae on the floor.
It grabbed the six-month-old by her head.
Aucott threw herself across the baby but it was too late.
Molly-Mae suffered injuries to every limb and puncture wounds to her brain.
She died from severe blood loss due to the head wounds, a post-mortem examination showed.
The dog was put down at the scene.
The court heard Riley knew her dog was aggressive and jealous of her baby and it had been kept away from Molly-Mae.
However, the baby's cries made it "an object of prey", the court heard.
A vet who treated the American pit bull - a breed banned in the UK - said Bruiser was one of the most dangerous dogs she had seen.
In June, Aucott, of Alfred Street, Northampton, admitted being in charge of a dangerously out of control dog resulting in death.
She was jailed for two years but will be released on licence after one year. She was also banned from owning a dog for ten years.
Riley, of Merrydale Square, Northampton, admitted owning a dangerously out of control dog on the first day of her trial later in June.
She was sentenced to two years, one of which she will serve in prison before being released on licence, and was banned from owning a dog for 10 years.
The recommendations of a Serious Case Review into the death of Molly-Mae are expected to be examined by Northampton Safeguarding Children Board officers next month.
