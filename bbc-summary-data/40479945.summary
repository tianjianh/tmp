The 32-year-old made 34 appearances for Paul Hurst's Shrewsbury last season, but lost his place to new signing Aristote Nsiala in January.
Ex-Brighton and Bristol City defender El-Abd left Town last week.
"Adam is a player I've always admired, going back to my playing days when he was a nightmare to come up against," said manager Gareth Ainsworth.
