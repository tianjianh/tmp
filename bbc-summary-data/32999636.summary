[SN]TITLE[SN]
Natwest Bank to close 11 branches across north Wales

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A high street bank has announced plans to close 11 branches in north Wales.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Natwest said it had made the "difficult decision" to close the branches in September due to a "wide range of factors" including usage.
The number of transactions made in some branches has fallen by almost half, a spokeswoman said.
The bank will instead be introducing mobile van branch services to each community.
Attempts will be made to redeploy staff to nearby branches in a bid to keep compulsory redundancies "to a minimum".
Branches will close their doors in St Asaph, Denbigh, Corwen and Llangollen in Denbighshire, as will the branches in Abersoch, Blaenau Ffestiniog and Tywyn in Gwynedd.
Those in Abergele and Rhos-on-Sea in Conwy, Buckley in Flintshire and Rossett in Wrexham will also close.
