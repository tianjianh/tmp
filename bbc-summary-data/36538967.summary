Zak Mills: Grimsby Town sign Boston defender on two-year deal

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Promoted Grimsby Town have made their second signing since returning to the Football League by bringing in defender Zak Mills from National League North neighbours Boston United.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 24-year-old full-back has signed a two-year deal, having turned down the offer of a new deal with the Pilgrims.
"The last couple of years at Boston I've always wanted to make the step up," said Mills.
"I'll be jumping two steps, but I'm sure I will pick it up quite quickly."
Mills' arrival follows the signing of fellow full-back Danny Andrew from League One side Fleetwood Town.
