Andre Gray: Burnley striker's response to homophobic tweets charge delayed

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Burnley have been given an extension for Andre Gray to respond to his misconduct charge over homophobic posts on Twitter in 2012.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Gray originally had until Wednesday to reply to the Football Association, but now has until 5 September.
One tweet from the 25-year-old striker's account appeared to condone killing gay people.
The tweets from four years ago were posted when Gray was playing for non-league Hinckley United.
Gray, who is charged with bringing the game into disrepute, has apologised and asked "for forgiveness" for the posts, insisting he is now a "completely different person" and did not "hold the beliefs written in those tweets".
The posts, which also contained offensive terms, were deleted soon after being highlighted.
