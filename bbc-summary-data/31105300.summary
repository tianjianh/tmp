Greater Maryhill Foodbank had raised a four-figure sum to send 10-year-old Chelsea Sommerville and her family on holiday.
The cash was stolen along with items of clothing and supermarket vouchers.
Glasgow comedian Frankie Boyle and the Scottish government each gave the foodbank £5,000.
Further donations and pledges have also been made.
The foodbank, in Chapel Street, Maryhill, was broken into through the roof over the weekend.
Chelsea broke her leg after being hit by a car on Sandbank Street in Glasgow on 14 November last year. Her friend, 11-year-old Sophie Brannan, died.
Sophie's 36-year-old uncle, Joseph Lloyd, suffered a fractured shoulder.
Christopher Hannah, 32, has been charged with offences, including causing death by dangerous driving, over the incident.
Foodbank organiser Julie Webster told the BBC Scotland news website the donations were "amazing".
"I know I live in a wonderful country, and a great city, so my expectations have always been high and people have never let me down," she said.
"But I never expected this volume. It makes me proud to be a Glaswegian.
"Today is a day I will never forget after previously just wanting to walk away."
Ms Webster said Frankie Boyle, already a supporter of the foodbank, had contacted her saying he wanted to help and then sent his PA over with a cheque for £5,000.
She was then contacted by First Minister Nicola Sturgeon who also sent a £5,000 cheque from the government.
"I can't describe how it feels that the Maryhill Foodbank is so well recognised by the Scottish government," she said.
Ms Webster also revealed that a supporter in Shetland had sent £1,000 and a man had walked into the foodbank with another £1,000.
Tesco have also said they will replace all the Tesco vouchers and clothing stolen in the raid and numerous other donations have been made.
Speaking about the thieves Ms Webster said: "They've taken food from people's mouths and shoes from children's feet. I will never forgive them."
Speaking earlier on BBC Radio Scotland's Good Morning Scotland programme, she said the theft was "absolutely devastating".
Describing the scene she said: "There was a lot of mess. Babies nappies and children's clothing that had been donated just scattered all over the floor with no respect for what we do.
"They did their best to get into the safe, which thankfully was secured, but unfortunately the tins with other money for this separate thing were smashed to a pulp in a kind of desperation to get what was in them."
In an emotional video post, Ms Webster described the theft as a "disgusting act of crime" and appealed for anyone with any information about the raid to come forward.
Struggling to fight back tears, she pledged: "We are having to start from scratch for Chelsea's appeal, but I would like to say to Chelsea's family: 'We'll get that money back Chelsea and we'll make sure you get your holiday'.
"I would ask the public to please support us as much as you can over the next couple of weeks to try and get this project back up and running again.
"I give you my 100% assurance that I will work day and night to make sure we get the food bank back up and running."
