Great Britain won four gold medals for the first time at a World Championships two years ago, courtesy of Mo Farah's distance double, Jessica Ennis-Hill and Greg Rutherford.
Those victories helped the British team finish fourth in the medal table, behind Kenya, Jamaica and the USA.
But with Ennis-Hill now retired and Rutherford injured, how many medals will they win in London? And will they meet UK Sport's target of between six and eight medals?
