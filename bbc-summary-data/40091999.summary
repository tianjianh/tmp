SNP manifesto summary: Key points at-a-glance

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The SNP has published its manifesto, Stronger for Scotland. The full document is available online. Here are the main things you need to know.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A programme that seeks to provide a "clear alternative to five more years of austerity".
Nicola Sturgeon's foreword says: "A vote for the SNP will strengthen Scotland's hand against further Tory cuts and ensure that progressive polices, like those pursued by the SNP government in Scotland, are firmly on the agenda at Westminster."
More welfare powers have been handed to the Scottish government at Holyrood, including the ability to create new benefits.
The power over health is in the hands of MSPs at Holyrood and not MPs at Westminster. However, some budgetary decisions made by the UK government can have a knock-on effect in Scotland. This is often referred to as the Barnett consequentials.
The power over education is in the hands of MSPs at Holyrood and not MPs at Westminster.
Westminster has full powers over foreign affairs and defence. For example, the UK government makes decisions on the future of Army, Navy and Air bases and what happens to Trident, which is stationed on the Clyde.
The power over housing is in the hands of MSPs at Holyrood and not MPs at Westminster.
Scottish Labour leader Kezia Dugdale said: "Nicola Sturgeon has once again confirmed that her number one priority in this election is her plan for another unwanted and divisive independence referendum. "It is clearer than ever that the majority of Scots who don't want another divisive independence referendum need to send Nicola Sturgeon a message that she should focus on the day job."
Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson said: "Nicola Sturgeon tried her usual trick today of trying to ignore independence in her speech but making sure she's pushing for it in her manifesto. Nobody is fooled any more. Strip away the bluster and it's written down in black and white - she wants to drag Scotland back to another referendum by as early as next autumn. That would cost jobs, risk our economy, and distract us all from the real job in hand - improving our schools and public services. This was a tired manifesto launch by a First Minister who has failed in this campaign to give people a single, positive reason for voting for her party."
Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Willie Rennie said: "The SNP must think we are stupid. They barely mentioned independence today but we know independence will be their top priority once the election is over."
Scottish Green Party MSP Mark Ruskell said: "There's now a big question mark over the SNP's ability to take on the Tories over climate change. Brexit threatens the progress the EU has made in creating cleaner air, beaches and rivers, protecting our seas, driving up animal welfare standards and ending the UK's reliance on coal for electricity. And yet, there was no mention of the environment or climate change at the party's manifesto launch."
