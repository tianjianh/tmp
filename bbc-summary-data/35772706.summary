[SN]TITLE[SN]
Scottish college lecturers announce strike dates

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Lecturers at further education colleges across Scotland have announced more details of a planned series of strikes.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Members of the EIS Further Education Lecturers' Association were already set to go on strike on Thursday next week.
The union has now confirmed it plans to hold two strikes the following week and more after Easter.
If the dispute is not settled, they plan to go on strike three days a week indefinitely from the last week of April onwards.
The planned strike dates are:
The dispute is linked to the return of national pay bargaining in the sector.
Lecturers at most colleges are angry about a 1% pay offer and are concerned about the differences between pay at different colleges.
They claim there are disparities of up to Â£10,000 a year.
The dispute at colleges in Glasgow is over a distinct issue - the union wants these colleges to join the national pay bargaining set-up.
Colleges Scotland, the body that represents Scotland's colleges, has said the pay offer which it put before the union is the best deal possible.
