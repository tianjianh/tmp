MK Dons have revealed revised plans for a proposed training facility, which includes up to 15 pitches, an academy and a three-storey hotel.

The recently-relegated club announced their intention to build in Cosgrove, Northamptonshire, last August.
The new plans have been lodged with South Northamptonshire District Council and the club hopes to request planning permission later this year.
A Facebook page has been set up by people opposing the plans.
The campaign group says the proposals will "undoubtedly have huge consequences and impact" on the landscape.
MK Dons said they had analysed comments made about the initial proposals and had looked to "incorporate those views in order to improve the project".
They have pledged that a full consultation with local residents and "other stakeholders" would be carried out.
South Northamptonshire District Council said it was not yet known if an environmental impact assessment (EIA) would have to be carried out.
