Tendring council boss pay rise offer turned down

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A top council officer willing to forgo his annual pay rise so his lowest paid workers could get the "living wage" has had his offer turned down.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
There are 41 staff at Tendring District Council paid less than £7.85 an hour.
Chief executive Ian Davidson, who earns £121,000 a year, offered up his £2,666 rise towards the £25,955 bill of providing all staff with a living wage.
The council turned down his offer and has instead decided to pay the full £25,955 from its own funds.
The pay rises come into force on 1 April.
"I am delighted that very soon we will have all our staff receiving at least the Living Wage," said Mr Davidson.
"While we cannot make others follow suit we are able to show the way as a community leader, and I hope businesses in Tendring will be encouraged to do the same."
