[SN]TITLE[SN]
North Sea strike ballot suspended after new offer

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A threat of industrial action in the UK oil and gas industry has been suspended after a new offer from employers.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Unite and GMB unions suspended the plans to ballot offshore workers on plans for a strike.
The Offshore Contractors Association (OCA) had been in negotiations with the unions over proposed changes to working conditions.
A revised offer will now be put to the unions' members in a consultative ballot.
The result is not expected for several weeks.
Bill Murray, chief executive of the OCA, said:  "We welcome that union officials have decided not to go to an industrial ballot over changes to shift and holiday patterns and are instead consulting with members."
