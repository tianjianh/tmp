Greater Manchester PCs Fiona Bone and Nicola Hughes were lured to a house in Mottram, Tameside on 18 September 2012.
Dale Cregan opened fire on the officers before throwing a grenade at them.
Mr Cameron attended the unveiling of a memorial stone at The Hub in Stockport Road in his first engagement since leaving Downing Street.
The memorial stone is less than a mile away from the scene of the attack.
Police Memorial Trust chairman Geraldine Winner, widow of former movie director Michael Winner, attended the service along with Greater Manchester's Chief Constable Ian Hopkins.
Mr Cameron said: "I spoke last night outside Number 10 Downing Street for the last time and I spoke about the extraordinary ethic of service in our country particularly our police, our intelligence, our armed forces.
He added the officers' murder had been "an act of pure evil" adding that it "shook the policing family to its very core".
"Our fallen heroes in the police exemplify the very best of us. To me they are the very epitome of service, bravery and sacrifice.
"This monument will ensure that their stories live on."
He added: "Fiona and Nicola are lights that will never go out. We are grateful of the service that they gave to the community. We will never let them be forgotten. We are so proud of them. May they rest in peace."
PCs Bone, 32, and Hughes, 23, were the 46th and 47th officers killed in the course of duty to be honoured by the trust since its formation 32 years ago.
Mr Hopkins said: "None of us will forget the morning of 18 September 2012 when PC Fiona Bone and PC Nicola Hughes were brutally murdered doing the job they both loved so passionately.
Cregan, who was also convicted of two other murders, was told in June 2013 that he would spend the rest of his life in prison.
