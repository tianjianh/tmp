In 2012, Tabei told the Japan Times she was proud of how her ascent was viewed.
"Back in 1970s Japan, it was still widely considered that men were the ones to work outside and women would stay at home.
"Even women who had jobs - they were asked just to serve tea. So it was unthinkable for them to be promoted in their workplaces."
Her ascent of Everest came 12 days after she was swept away in an avalanche on the mountain. She was dug out by a guide and continued the expedition.
