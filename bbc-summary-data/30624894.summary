A statement issued through his lawyer confirmed the split: "Chris Rock has filed for divorce from his wife, Malaak.
"This is a personal matter and Chris requests privacy as he and Malaak work through this process and focus on their family."
The couple have two children together, daughters, Lola Simone, 12, and Zahra Savannah, 10.
Chris Rock once joked during a routine: "Relationships are hard, man. In order for any relationship to work both of you have to be on the same page.
"You both have to have the same focus. And that focus is... it's all about her."
Chris Rock made his name as a stand-up comic in the 1980s.
The 49-year-old then went onto forge a successful TV career before appearing in films like Dr Dolittle and Madagascar.
In his latest film, Top Five, Rock plays a comedian who is persuaded into having his upcoming wedding screened as part of a reality TV show.
