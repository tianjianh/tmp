Arrest warrant issued for Cambodian opposition leader Sam Rainsy

A Cambodian court has issued an arrest warrant for opposition leader Sam Rainsy over a conviction for defamation in 2011.

It was issued after Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen threatened Mr Rainsy with legal action for saying the ruling party would "derail" elections in 2018.
Hun Sen has ruled for more than 30 years and is known for tough tactics.
Political tensions have been rising in Cambodia despite a truce between the two politicians last year.
Mr Rainsy said during a visit to Japan earlier this week that, in the wake of the historic Myanmar election, it was imperative the international community did not allow Hun Sen's Cambodian People's Party (CPP) to delay elections. Mr Rainsy is now in South Korea.
In a response posted to his Facebook page, Hun Sen said: "I cannot keep calm because of this insult by the son of a traitor."
Friday's warrant relates to a 2011 conviction against Mr Rainsy, then in self-exile in France, for comments he made about the Cambodian foreign minister.
Opposition MP Mu Sochua told the BBC the warrant was a "very serious blow to even the facade of democracy in Cambodia".
"While the world and in particular the Asian region is inspired by the determination of the people of Myanmar, Cambodia sadly is seeing a deteriorating pre-election political environment," she said.
Mr Rainsy returned to Cambodia ahead of the July 2013 national election after receiving a royal pardon, though it was not immediately clear if the defamation conviction was part of the deal as he had been convicted of a string of offences.
His Cambodia National Rescue Party won 55 of 123 seats in the 2013 polls but led months of street protests after accusing the ruling CPP of rigging the vote.
A year-long parliamentary boycott ended in August last year after a deal was struck on election reform.
But simmering tensions have erupted in recent weeks, with two opposition MPs beaten up outside parliament last month following a demonstration by CPP supporters.
