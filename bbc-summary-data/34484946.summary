Reading Broad Street plan to lift ban on cyclists

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A cycling ban in a Reading shopping street could be lifted after a bike hire station was installed nearby.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A couple of bike racks have been added in Broad Street West, but that stretch of road currently has a cycling ban.
There is also a ReadyBike docking station in the east part of Broad Street, all of which is pedestrianised, and where cycling has not been banned.
This "can cause confusion for cyclists and pedestrians" and was hard "to enforce", the council said.
Reading Borough Council is planning a public consultation later in the year.
