Plans for permanent gypsy site in Gwynedd rejected

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Plans for a permanent gypsy site in Gwynedd have been rejected.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The plot of land, between Y Felinheli and Bangor, had been earmarked to include eight pitches with permanent units, an access track and a toilet block.
But councillors refused planning permission for the site on Monday.
The planning report said the proposal was "an overdevelopment" of the site, based on the number of units and lack of amenities.
