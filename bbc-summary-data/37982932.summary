[SN]TITLE[SN]
Notts County 0-1 Cambridge United

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Cambridge boss Shaun Derry made it three wins out of three against his old club Notts County with victory at Meadow Lane.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The U's boss, sacked by the Magpies in March 2015, did the double over his former team last season and they are on course to do so again this term.
They had Conor Newton to thank for this success as he capitalised on some excellent work by Uche Ikpeazu to curl around Adam Collin in the 26th minute.
Genaro Snijders should have equalised for Notts County when he raced clear through on goal but dragged his shot wide of the far post.
In the second half, the hosts had the bulk of possession but found chances hard to come by until the death.
Their best opportunity came when Matt Tootle headed into the box which forced Will Norris to punch back into the area.
The ball dropped to Aaron Collins but the substitute's shot hit a defender on the line and bounced off the back of Norris for a corner.
