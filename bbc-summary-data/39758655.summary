Wigan Athletic chief executive Jonathan Jackson says they do have a shortlist of potential new managers ready after their relegation to League One.

The Latics' immediate return to the third tier was confirmed after their 1-0 loss at Reading in the Championship.
Graham Barrow has been interim manager since March when Warren Joyce left after four months in charge.
"We've been looking at a number of factors in getting the right person," Jackson told BBC Radio Manchester.
"We have a shortlist of people and we've been working on that. We'll take our time, but that is something that will probably be done at the end of May or early June - we know the kind of manager we're looking for.
"We were relegated two years ago, so we know what League One is all about and we start planning right now."
Ex-Latics midfielder Barrow, 62, took temporary charge of Wigan for a third time on 13 March when Wigan were four points from safety with nine games remaining.
He has since overseen two wins and a draw in his eight games in charge.
On a miserable afternoon at the Madejski Stadium it was also confirmed after the game that midfielder Shaun McDonald suffered a broken leg.
"I expected myself to do better because when I came years ago I managed to stop relegation into non-league," said Barrow.
"I was probably foolish enough to think I could stop this happening, but I haven't."
Asked if he will be at the club next season, he said: "I honestly don't know the answer to that, I hope so.
"I don't want a situation that has happened in the past a couple of times where I'm just around the place."
