He will be available for three Championship games, eight in the T20 Blast and three in the One-Day Cup between 9 June and 18 July.
The 25-year-old scored 2,633 runs for New Zealand in 2015 across all formats, including eight centuries.
"His value as a player is beyond question," said Yorkshire head coach Jason Gillespie.
"His attitude, work ethic and leadership as an overseas player is brilliant."
Williamson and England's Joe Root, a Yorkshire team-mate, are currently joint second in the International Cricket Council Test batting rankings behind Australia captain Steve Smith.
The White Rose county have won the Championship title for the past two seasons and are looking to become the first side to do so three times in a row since their Yorkshire predecessors from 1966-1968.
"I am looking forward to joining the team for a third term this summer," Williamson told the Yorkshire website.
"It is enjoyable being part of a successful team that are hungry for ongoing success."
