The choices, from the culture, Welsh language and communications committee, include saving local heritage, history teaching and music education funding.
The committee sought ideas over the summer and is now asking for people to vote for the suggestions they prefer.
Chairwoman Bethan Jenkins said AMs wanted to know what people thought was most pressing.
Ms Jenkins said the assembly was created to move decision making closer to the people affected, and this was the "next step on that road".
"We have already had suggestions for a broad range of subjects," she said.
"Two of those - the media in Wales, and the Welsh Government's strategy for the Welsh language - will be taken on as early work for the committee.
"But we would like people to look over the list and tell us which ideas they think are important.
"We won't be forgetting about the other ideas and we'll look to include them at some point in the future."
An inquiry into history teaching would focus on Welsh culture and heritage.
The other options available include:
Details of how to vote will be released on the committee's website and Twitter account at lunchtime on Monday.
The poll will remain open until 14 November.
