Celtic are good enough for English Premier League, says Patrick Roberts

Celtic would have what it takes to compete in the English Premier League, according to winger Patrick Roberts.

The 20-year-old has won two Premiership titles in his time at Celtic Park on loan from Manchester City, who paid about Â£13m to sign him in 2015.
And he believes the newly-crowned Scottish Champions could cut it in England's top flight.
"They are top professionals and great lads so I think they could compete in the Premier League," he said.
"The Premier League is a tough league, you can see that every week when top teams get beat. You can't quite expect what's going to happen.
"The belief in the team here and the desire to win and the experience in the team, and some young boys as well that are coming through who are excellent, so yes, they could (compete)."
Roberts made the loan move to Celtic while Ronny Deila was still manager and the English youngster has noticed a major difference since Brendan Rodgers took over last summer.
"I think he (Brendan Rodgers) has brought a different style of play, an attacking style and a belief in the club to play a way that he has known," added Roberts, who started Sunday's title-clinching match against Hearts, scoring the fourth goal in a 5-0 rout.
"And I think the boys have bought into that and executed it brilliantly.
"On Sunday we had no striker and I was up there - I know I've played it before - and you see fluidity up top to play like we did. To get five goals is good and it's what the manager has brought to the club.
"Especially for me, I love attacking and we get a lot of chances."
With his loan stint due to end this summer, Roberts remains unsure about where he will be plying his trade next season.
However, he is not ruling out a return to Celtic Park. "I've always said I don't know what my future will bring, but I have always enjoyed my time here," he said.
"I've loved it and I've still got a few games to go now and I want to do that well and finish off the job.
"Celtic have been brilliant to me and are a massive club. I just want to play football every weekend. I am still a boy and I enjoy playing football wherever it is, I don't know.
"I will come to that when it comes to that and I will just take it step by step."
