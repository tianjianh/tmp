Hibs fan heading for Hampden on foot for charity

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A Hibs fan is planning to walk to the League Cup Final at Hampden Park in Glasgow to raise money for charity.

Davie Fulton is travelling the 45 miles from Edinburgh on foot - to see Sunday's clash with Ross County - to try to raise Â£10,000 for Marie Curie.
Mr Fulton did the same walk when Hibs made the Scottish Cup Final in 2013.
He has been inspired to repeat the effort after hearing that his aunt and sister-in-law have both been diagnosed with terminal cancer.
On his Just Giving page, which has raised more than Â£1,000 so far, Mr Fulton said: "I would love everybody to help me try and reach my goal of Â£10,000 as I know how much cancer affects everyone.
"I am leaving Calder Rd junction about 6am on Saturday 12th March and my daughter's boyfriend has kindly offered to cycle along side me with refreshments."
He hopes to arrive at Hampden on Saturday evening and relax before going to the final on Sunday afternoon.
