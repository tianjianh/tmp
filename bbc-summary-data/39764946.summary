Great Britain will not have a mixed doubles curling team at the 2018 Winter Olympics after Scottish duo Gina Aitken and Bruce Mouat fell short at the World Championship in Canada.

Team Aitken won nine of their 11 matches in Alberta but eventually finished 11th to miss out on one of the seven berths up for grabs.
The cumulative scores from the last two Worlds went towards qualifying.
"I'm gutted but really proud of how we played in this event," said Mouat.
"It's probably the best we've played all season, so onwards and upwards."
The Scots went into the tournament ranked fourth on the basis of last year's results and made the perfect start by winning their seven round-robin matches.
Drawing Canada in the last 16 proved crucial, however, as the Scots slipped to an 8-3 defeat.
Team Aitken saw off Sweden, lost to Russia and beat Italy in the placing matches, but that was not enough to secure a qualification spot for the inaugural mixed doubles competition at the Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea.
Aitken added: "We know we can compete really well with the teams on the podium.
"So I guess we just hope we can come back from here and better this.
"Unfortunately, we came off the wrong side of a couple of really big ones, which has resulted in us not getting enough points."
Ireland's Neil and Alison Fyfe finished joint 13th, Ben and Anna Fowler of England were 17th and Wales' Dawn Watson and Adrian Meikle finished 23rd.
