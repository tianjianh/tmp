She had a lavish 15th birthday party, which is traditional in many parts of Latin America, as it is considered the moment when young girls mark the start of adulthood.
For Massiel this party marked the moment when she could, finally, decide when to wear make-up and go out with friends by herself, although she admits becoming an adult brings new expectations and responsibilities.
Her story is part of a series of six short films for the BBC 100 Women season called 'Good Girl', in which young women around the world talk about the pressure to fit in with society's expectations.
