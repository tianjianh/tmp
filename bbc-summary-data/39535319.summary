Tim Bresnan took 4-53 as Hampshire, who started on 58-5, were dismissed for 141, helped by a 52-run stand between Lewis McManus (41) and Brad Wheal (18).
The efforts of new signing Kyle Abbott (7-41) kept Hampshire in touch, limiting Yorkshire to 187, with Gary Ballance scoring 55 and Andrew Hodd 54.
Openers Jimmy Adams and Michael Carberry then survived to finish 10-0.
On a topsy-turvy day, Yorkshire seamer Ben Coad (6-37) - who had taken all five Hampshire wickets on day one - looked set to continue his remarkable run when he had Abbott caught early on.
However, Bresnan took over wicket-taking duties, removing England international Liam Dawson lbw and then having Gareth Berg caught in the slips in the same over.
Wicketkeeper McManus played sensibly to help his side recover from 75-8, before Bresnan returned to clean up the innings and give Yorkshire a first-innings lead of 132 runs.
Yorkshire began well, but Adam Lyth (29), Peter Handscomb and Alex Lees all fell to former South Africa international Abbott to leave Yorkshire 59-3.
Home captain Ballance, who scored a vital 120 in the first innings, was again on form, hitting seven fours in his half-century before Hodd's quick scoring pushed Yorkshire's lead beyond 300 as the tail was knocked over.
Hampshire, whose top six all fell to Coad in the first innings, negotiated four overs to leave a fascinating third day in store.
Yorkshire seamer Ben Coad told BBC Radio Leeds:
"We're fairly happy. We could have done with getting a few more runs today, but we've put ourselves in a good position and hopefully we can get over the line.
"The pitch is still doing a bit. It's up and down now as well, so it's bowler-friendly. 350-400 would have been ideal, but 320 is enough, hopefully.
"Gary Ballance batted unbelievably well, and Andrew Hodd at the end counter-attacked and played like he does. They were outstanding.
"I'm very happy with my own performance. I felt like I probably bowled better against Leeds/Bradford last weekend, but I was just unfortunate in not getting the edges and a couple of decisions. "
Hampshire fast bowler Kyle Abbott told BBC Radio Solent:
"I'd like to think we're back in the game. We had a poor session on Friday evening which put us on the back foot after a pretty good day. I probably thought we let them get 50 too many in the first innings - 200 would have been great. But we've given ourselves every opportunity.
"History shows it shouldn't deteriorate too badly, and scoring's been pretty quick. There's no reason why we can't knock those off.
"If it's not in the right spot and you're slightly off, it's pretty easy to bat on and is quite nicely paced. But, if you get it right as a bowler, there's still something there.
"It's coming out nicely for me, but it's still not exactly where I want to be, if I'm critical. I'd like to keep the run-rate a bit tighter, but it been pretty much three and a half an over for most of the game."
