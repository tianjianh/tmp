The company tweeted on Thursday: "Forecast: Winter weather ahead! @DisneyAnimation developing #Frozen2."
It was accompanied by a picture of sisters Elsa and Anna, with Sven the reindeer and Kristoff.
Disney also confirmed that the directors of the first film, Chris Buck and Jennifer Lee, are returning.
Jennifer Lee tweeted: "At last, I can say - FROZEN 2!!!! I'm beyond excited to create alongside my Frozen family!"
There's no news on a release date yet.
Those of you who can't wait for the sequel can see a seven-minute follow-up film called Frozen Fever in cinemas later this month.
It's being shown at screenings of new Disney film Cinderella.
Frozen was released at the end of 2013 and went on to become the highest-grossing animation of all time, and the fifth biggest film overall.
So far it's raked in $1.274 billion (Â£857 million) worldwide.
The movie won two Oscars in 2014 - best animated feature and best original song for Let It Go.
