England U21s: Harry Kane wants to play in Euros says Roy Hodgson

Harry Kane wants to "finish the job" at the European Under-21 Championship this summer, says England boss Roy Hodgson.

The Tottenham striker scored 79 seconds into his senior England debut against Lithuania on Friday, and made his first start in the 1-1 draw in Italy.
But the 21-year-old played a key part in helping England's Under-21s qualify unbeaten for the tournament in June.
Hodgson said: "Harry wants to go with the Under-21s. He wants to finish the job that he has done."
Spurs boss Mauricio Pochettino has suggested that Kane might benefit from resting this summer. The tournament is being held in the Czech Republic and begins for England against Portugal on 18 June.
Everton manager Roberto Martinez has also said that Ross Barkley, 21, needs a "proper break" after representing the senior team at last summer's World Cup in Brazil.
But former England captain Gary Lineker said it would be a "national disgrace" if clubs blocked young players from taking part.
And England Under-21 boss Gareth Southgate does not expect Premier League clubs to block players from attending, while ex-England international Phil Neville said Kane's development would be "enhanced" by playing for the U21s.
The issue is further complicated for Kane as Spurs have a post-season friendly match in Australia three weeks before the Under-21 tournament begins.
Hodgson added: "He's had to work his way into the team and in my conversations with him it has been pretty obvious to me he would like to play in this tournament.
"Harry can play an important part and maybe help them go far. That certainly won't hurt his chances in the first team and I am happy to back him."
The England manager also played down suggestions that taking part in the tournament would leave the player exhausted: "I've got to say I'm not a great lover of the burnout argument," Hodgson said.
"If you want to be an international player then you've got to accept football tournaments take place in the summer at the end of the season.
"In my lifetime, as soon as the season has finished, footballers have gone to tournaments. Anyone who wants to be a top-class international footballer and really believes he can help his country get to these tournaments, can't then come and talk about burnout."
Meanwhile, Hodgson called on England fans not to chant anti-IRA songs when his England side play their next game, against the Republic of Ireland in a friendly in Dublin on 7 June.
"There's no way I can justify or be glad about any political chants of that nature," he added.
