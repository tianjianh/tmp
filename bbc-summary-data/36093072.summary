£153,000 hut sale at Abersoch breaks beach record

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A dilapidated beach hut on a north Wales beach has sold at auction for an eye-watering £153,000.

The wooden building is at Abersoch on the Llŷn Peninsula in Gwynedd.
Measuring just 13ft by 9ft, it has no electricity or water - and you are banned from sleeping in it overnight.
For the same price just a few miles away you could snap-up a two-bedroom house in the village of Llanbedrog - or even a seven-bedroom terraced house at Tywyn across Cardigan Bay.
"It's certainly the highest price ever achieved for a beach hut in Abersoch," remarked Tony Webber, auction surveyor at Beresford Adams Countrywide Auctions.
"It's quite incredible. We had two very determined bidders, both from the Cheshire area, who were bidding separately. They were very determined to buy it."
The auctioneers said the hut is "in need of some TLC" - but does include part of the beach in front of the hut into the sea.
The previous record for the beach huts on the Abersoch sands was £70,000 in 2008.
