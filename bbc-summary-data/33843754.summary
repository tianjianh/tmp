The man, 27, was detained on Sunday after "suspicious items" were found at his home in Naseby Road, police said.
Houses in the street were temporarily evacuated while West Midlands Police, the fire service and army officers conducted safety checks on the items.
Police said there was no immediate risk to the public.
The house, in the Alum Rock area of the city, will remain cordoned off until Monday while searches are under way.
Officers had originally arrested the man on suspicion of "going equipped" and possession of an offensive weapon at 01:20 BST.
He was then arrested of suspicion of terror offences on Sunday afternoon following the house search.
Detectives from the West Midlands Counter Terrorism Unit have until Tuesday morning to question the man.
