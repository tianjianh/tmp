Dan Lydiate will captain Wales in the absence of Sam Warburton against England at Twickenham on Sunday.

Cardiff forward Warburton is out with the shoulder injury that has sidelined him since he suffered it against Ospreys on 30 April.
Gloucester's Ross Moriarty will win his sixth cap at blindside flanker, with Lydiate switching to openside.
Lock Alun Wyn Jones features after a heel injury, but prop Paul James has failed to recover from a calf injury.
Fellow prop Samson Lee and centre Scott Williams are fit after missing the end of the Pro12 season.
Sunday's game is a warm-up for Wales' three Tests against world champions New Zealand in June, a tour for which Warburton has been named captain.
Lydiate captained Wales in their 67-14 win over Italy in their final game of the Six Nations in March.
"Dan led us exceptionally well in our last match so deserves to continue with those duties this weekend," said head coach Warren Gatland.
"When you look at the summer series ahead, this is a really important match for the squad.
"It will be an important hit-out for both teams and as ever it will be an important Test match as it's England v Wales at Twickenham."
British and Irish Lions second-row Jones and loose-head James both missed Ospreys' Pro12 run-in, with James having eye surgery in April.
Tight-head Lee missed Scarlets' final game of the season after suffering a head blow in the Judgement Day win over Newport Gwent Dragons, while team-mate Williams was also absent with a hamstring injury.
Gatland's side are without prop Tomas Francis at Twickenham as he plays for Exeter in the Premiership final 24 hours earlier, while Bristol back Matthew Morgan will also be missing as he recovers from the Championship play-off final second leg against Doncaster on Wednesday.
France-based players Jonathan Davies and Luke Charteris are unavailable too as they feature in the Top 14.
Northampton forward Teimana Harrison will make his England debut, starting at blindside flanker.
Prop Ellis Genge, hooker Tommy Taylor and centre Ollie Devoto are in line for debuts from the bench.
Players from Premiership finalists Saracens and Exeter are not included.
