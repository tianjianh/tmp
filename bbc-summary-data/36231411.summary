[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Martin Surl has been re-elected to the role of Police and Crime Commissioner for Gloucestershire.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Independent received 41% of the first preference votes.
He was elected after the second preference votes were counted, when no candidates received more than 50% of first preference votes.
Mr Surl received a total of 78,592 first and second preferences compared to his nearest challenger, Conservative's Will Windsor-Clive.
Mr Windsor-Clive received 51,567 of the first and second preference votes.
The only other candidate, Labour's Barry Kirby, was eliminated after the first round of counting because he did not have enough votes to continue.
Turnout was 30%, up from 17% in 2012.
Mr Surl said he wanted to thank everyone who "made it possible" for him, but added: "The work is just beginning here now.
"I will do my very, very best to serve the county well, to make sure the police serve you well, and that we are a decent, honourable county."
