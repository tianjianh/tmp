[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Emergency services were called to Plas Arthur leisure centre in Llangefni at 10:50 GMT on Wednesday.
None of the children are seriously ill, but are being assessed at nearby Ysgol Gyfun Llangefni.
An Anglesey council spokesman said it was an "isolated incident" and symptoms were not believed to be serious. The cause of the rashes is not yet clear.
The centre's dry side facilities have reopened, but the pool will stay shut for further testing.
