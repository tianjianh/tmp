[SN]TITLE[SN]
Leicestershire PCC election: Labour candidate wins vote

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Labour candidate Lord Bach has been elected as police and crime commissioner for Leicestershire.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
He will take over from Conservative PCC Sir Clive Loader, who was elected in November 2012.
Neither candidate got 50% of first preference votes, so second preference ballots had to be counted.
Lord Bach got 78,188 votes, while his nearest rival - the Conservative candidate Neil Bannister - got 58,305 votes.
He addressed the crowd after the result was announced in Whitwick.
"Of course as the Labour candidate I'm extremely proud to be standing here having won this particular election," he said.
"But I say right away, that from this moment on of course, my obligation is to all people who live in Leicester, Leicestershire and Rutland.
"That's my duty and that's what I'm proud to be able to do."
