Swansea City are planning to open negotiations about a new contract for assistant manager Claude Makelele.

The former Chelsea midfielder and France international was appointed in January, having worked with Swans head coach Paul Clement at Paris St-Germain.
Makelele's current deal with the Swans, who are 16th in the Premier League, expires at the end of this season.
"We haven't had any discussions but I don't think those discussions will be too far away," said Clement.
He continued: "Claude's very focused on his job and helping me, helping the players and helping the team be successful.
"He comes in every day with a lot of energy, positive attitude, smile on his face - they're the kind of characters and personalities we need around us at the moment."

Clement took charge of Swansea on 3 January and appointed Makelele as his assistant eight days later.
The Swans were four points adrift at the bottom of the Premier League table when Clement arrived, but four wins from seven league games since then have seen them climb out of the relegation zone.
The former Bayern Munich and Real Madrid assistant boss was named the Premier League's manager of the month for January, and his side host Burnley on Saturday.
Winger Jefferson Montero has returned to full training but will not feature at the Liberty Stadium, while midfielder Ki Sung-yueng remains sidelined.
Clement says two of his January signings, winger Luciano Narsingh and forward Jordan Ayew, could earn their first starts for Swansea against Burnley.
