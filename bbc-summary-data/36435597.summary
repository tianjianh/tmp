Wales v New Zealand: Luke Charteris boost for tourists

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Luke Charteris will be available for Wales' first Test with the All Blacks on 11 June after he was released by his club to travel to New Zealand.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Coach Warren Gatland had been unsure when French Top 14 club Racing 92 would let second row Charteris go.
Players need to be in New Zealand by Monday to play in the first Test.
Charteris and Clermont Auvergne centre Jonathan Davies both missed Sunday's 27-13 defeat by England because they were on club duty.
Gatland has said players must "be in New Zealand ready to train on the Monday [6 June] before the All Blacks game under World Rugby regulations".
Fourth-placed Racing are battling for a home draw in the French domestic league play-offs.
They play second-placed Montpellier on Sunday, 5 June in the final game of the regular season.
Charteris will miss that game and the play-offs that follow, ending his playing days in Paris as he heads for Bath next season.
Davies' Clermont host La Rochelle on Sunday with the 2013 British and Irish Lion's stint there soon to end as he returns to Scarlets.
