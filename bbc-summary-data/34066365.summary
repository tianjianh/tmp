Eight acts made the shortlist for the award, now in its 35th year, including James Acaster, Joseph Morpurgo, Nish Kumar and Kieran Hodgson.
The other nominees for best comedy show were Sam Simmons, Sarah Kendall, Trygve Wakenshaw and Seymour Mace.
The winners will be announced in a ceremony on Saturday at Dovecot Studios in Edinburgh.
The awards celebrate the best comedy at the Edinburgh Fringe.
Among the nominees, Acaster was shortlisted for best show award for the fourth year in a row and physical comedian Trygve Wakenshaw, billed as a modern-day clown, made the list for the first time.
Sarah Kendall is the only woman on the list, while fellow Australian Sam Simmons sees his absurdist comedy get a nomination for a third time.
The nominations for Best Newcomer were: Adam Hess; Daphne do Edinburgh; Larry Dean; Sofie Hagen; The Story Beast; Tom Ballard and Badults star Tom Parry.
Nica Burns, producer of the Foster's Edinburgh Comedy Awards, said: "This is a record-breaking year with an eight-strong shortlist for best comedy show and a seven-strong shortlist for best newcomer.
"The judging debate was the longest in the 35-year history of the comedy awards.
"This demonstrates the vibrancy of the Edinburgh Fringe and extraordinary range of talent on show this year."
"Star" names, who have already had a TV series or can perform in a 500-seat venue under their own name, are not eligible for the best comedy show award.
However, Ms Burns said there were 600 shows eligible for the shortlist for the Â£10,000 prize.
Previous winners of the comedy awards, which have been running since 1981, include Bridget Christie, Steve Coogan, Russell Kane, Al Murray, the League of Gentlemen, Jenny Eclair, Lee Evans and Frank Skinner.
