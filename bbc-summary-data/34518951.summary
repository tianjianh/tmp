A 27-year-old man who stabbed his pregnant wife to death has been jailed for a minimum of 25 years.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Tariq Khan, of Manningham, West Yorkshire, was given a life sentence at Bradford Crown Court.
Khan was arrested in June after killing his wife Nadia, 24.
At an earlier hearing he admitted stabbing his wife who was six-months pregnant, to death and a charge of child destruction at the former family home in Holker Street, Manningham.
Khan, who had separated from her shortly before the murder, was facing deportation proceedings at the time.
He admitted a charge of assaulting his wife about a month before her murder.
Judge Roger Thomas QC said Khan had meant not only to punish his wife, but "had had a specific intent to destroy her baby".
Nadia Khan's family issued a statement saying her death had profoundly affected them.
"Nadia was a caring daughter and sister as well as a loving mother, and it kills us that her children will grow up without a mum and dad," it said.
"Tariq Khan has caused us a lot of pain and we hope he stays in jail for the rest of his life, as his sentence can never be enough for what he has done."
Det Ch Insp Mark McManus, said: "Khan was clearly a very dangerous man and the community of Manningham is a safer place with him behind bars."
