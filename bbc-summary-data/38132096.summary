Pantycelyn halls: Student numbers 'must rise for funding bid'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Funding for the refurbishment of a closed halls of residence for Welsh-speaking students at Aberystwyth University could face uncertainty.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The university needs to ask the Higher Education Funding Council for Wales (HEFCW) for permission to apply for a loan to pay for work at Pantycelyn halls.
But a report said the university must attract more students before applying.
The university said work was continuing to ensure funding can be obtained.
Students climbed on to the roof of the halls last June to protest against the proposed closure, claiming the university did not value the Welsh language enough to keep it open.
A board was later set up to secure its future and Â£8m of improvements, including the refurbishment of 200 en-suite rooms, were suggested.
The university has said it planned to reopen the halls in September 2019, but the necessary funding needed to be secured before it could give a definitive commitment.
Now, a report to the university's council has been made public which confirms "HEFCW's agreement to procure such finance will only be forthcoming once the university has achieved the required sustained growth in student numbers".
It added the outcome of Brexit also threatened the future sustainability of the university.
The report continued that while the case for refurbishing Pantycelyn to provide Welsh-medium accommodation was "persuasive", the project must be considered in the context of others.
Other funding options suggested in the report include fundraising from individuals or trusts.
An Aberystwyth University spokeswoman would not comment on current recruitment figures, but said: "The university has stated clearly that Pantycelyn is one of its spending priorities.
"A team of Welsh-speaking architects has been appointed to work on the detailed plans for upgrading the building.
"In the meantime, work continues to ensure the required funding can be obtained, in line with the project timetable to reopen the building in September 2019.
"Loans are expected to be part of the funding of the university's priority capital projects. In common with all other universities in Wales, HEFCW's agreement will be required for any loan finance proposal of this scale.
"The university has not yet sought HEFCW's agreement for any loan."
