Johanna Powell, from Cardiff, was with three friends on the Mekong River near Pak Beng in April.
The 37-year-old, a BBC Wales picture editor, was probably asleep when the boat hit rough water, the Aberdare inquest heard.
A conclusion of accidental death has been recorded.
Tammy Evans described the moment the boat went down before the frantic search for her friend.
In a statement read to the court, Ms Evans said: "Johanna was half asleep with her head on the table when the boat suddenly rocked to one side and then the other.
"I was thrown from my seat and went down with the boat. I was trapped and fully submerged under the filthy and dirty water.
"I reached out and managed to grab a piece of the boat to free myself and then reached the surface.
"As I was being dragged along the river I was screaming 'where's Johanna?"
Another passenger, Sinead Mary O'Brien,  said she swam for her life before a rescue boat arrived.
"We went downstream and found a few of the others but we could not find Johanna," she said in a statement.
The shaken group were taken to dry land where they anxiously waited for news of Ms Powell.
Ms Evans added: "They (the tourist police) seemed more concerned about whether we were going to sue the captain for loss of our property... there was no mention of Johanna."
It was two days before Ms Powell's body was found following a search by people living in the area.
Coroner Andrew Barkley told the hearing he had received "limited information" from officials leading the investigation, but said inquiries were continuing.
He concluded Ms Powell's death was an accident caused by immersion in water.
