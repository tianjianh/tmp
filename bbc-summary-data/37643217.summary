This year visitors can follow in the footsteps of plant hunters of the past, as the show takes them on a virtual journey around the world.
Visitors will follow a trail of light installations around the garden.
Ten original pieces of music have been written for the 22-night event, which is now in its third year. Last year the show attracted 28,000 visitors.
