Wycombe Wanderers have signed Sheffield Wednesday goalkeeper Cameron Dawson on a seven-day emergency loan after an injury to first-choice Scott Brown.

Dawson will go straight into the side to start against Bristol City in the EFL Cup on Tuesday.
The 21-year-old joins the Chairboys as they only have 47-year-old goalkeeper coach Barry Richardson for back-up.
His previous first-team experience came on loan at Alfreton in 2014-15, where he made 17 appearances.
