The Belfast Telegraph and the The Irish News reported on Wednesday that the book had received funding from the Arts Council of Northern Ireland (ACNI).
The book was written by the graphic novelist Gerry Hunt and published by O'Brien Press in Dublin.
Bobby Sands was one of ten hunger strikers who died in the Maze Prison in 1981. Unionists described the book as "republican propaganda".
The Arts Council has been criticised for funding the publication of the illustrated book called "Bobby Sands, Freedom Fighter".
The council is funded by Stormont's culture and arts department.
The BBC understands that the fact that Bobby Sands would be the subject of the book would have been made known to ACNI in O'Brien's application for a grant, but not the title or content of the book.
The UK National Lottery also part-funded the publication.
In a statement, the Arts Council said it had received a "strong application" from O'Brien Press, which is described as one of Ireland's largest publishers, and said it had "satisfied all of our criteria".
The Ulster Unionist MP Tom Elliott said he believed the book glorified terrorism.
"What does concern me is that the Arts Council have given money to this book that is really a glorification of Bobby Sands' life as a terrorist," he said.
Danny Morrison is the secretary of the Bobby Sands Trust and one of the characters featured in the graphic novel.
"Bobby Sands spent a third of his life in jail," he said.
"He was 27 years of age when he died after 66 days on hunger strike. He was the MP for Fermanagh-South Tyrone. He was a poet and a writer.
"Bobby Sands is a role model because he's an Irish patriot."
The hunger strike began in the prison as a protest by republican prisoners over their right to be treated as 'special category' political prisoners rather than criminals.
During his time on hunger strike Bobby Sands stood for election as an MP for Fermanagh-South Tyrone and was elected. He died less than a month later on 5 May 1981.
