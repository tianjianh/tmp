The Liverpool fighter, 30, has won 23 of his 24 fights and faces undefeated champion Pedraza for the IBF title.
Puerto Rican Pedraza, 26, won the vacant title in June 2015.
Josh Warrington also fights on Saturday night, aiming to defend his WBC International featherweight title against Hisashi Amagsa in Leeds.
Anthony Joshua took the number of British world title holders to 12 when he took the IBF heavyweight crown from American Charles Martin last Saturday.
Promoter Lou DiBella has called it a "British boxing revolution" and says "it is pretty amazing what you guys are doing over there".
"Every British fighter out there fighting for a title is dangerous because they're all watching what's going on around them," the American told Sky Sports.
"Stephen thinks he can win and he's here to win. You guys are hot. Right now, there is no country in the world hotter than Great Britain."
Warrington, from Leeds, holds a 22-0 record ahead of his bout with the taller and more experienced Japanese boxer Amagsa, 30.
The 25-year-old, whose last win came against Australian Joel Brunker in November, has said he wants to fight IBF world featherweight champion Lee Selby.
