A gamekeeper has been found safe and well after being forced to spend the night in freezing and wintry conditions in the Cairngorms.

His single-person all-terrain vehicle broke down and he became disorientated in whiteout conditions while working in a remote location on the Gaick Estate.
The gamekeeper stayed with his vehicle and used survival equipment he had been given by his employers.
Searchers found him early on Thursday morning.
He was located near the mountain Carn an Fhidhleir, near Glen Feshie.
An initial search on Wednesday began at 15:00 and at one point the searchers believe they came within a few hundred metres of where the man was sheltering.
The search was suspended at 03:30 on Thursday, before it was resumed at first light.
Conditions were too bad during the night for a coastguard helicopter to play a part in the search, but the aircraft and crew did manage to airlift searchers into the area and was involved again when the search was restarted.
About 40 people took part in the overall search which involved Cairngorm Mountain Rescue Team supported by members of Lossiemouth-based RAF Mountain Rescue Team, Tayside Mountain Rescue Team and workers from Glen Feshie Estate.
Cairngorm MRT leader Willie Anderson said "This was a serious incident in very poor weather which took place on one of the remotest 3,000ft height mountains in our area.
"Although we had a number of leads, we were only able to narrow the search area down to an area of approximately 200 square kilometres and this area had to be covered in the dark, with blizzard conditions and a significant avalanche danger."
He added: " I am delighted with the outcome as we were really concerned about the weather and location. A tremendous effort by all involved."
