Mr Turnbull arrived in Washington after meeting Australian troops in Iraq and Afghanistan over the weekend.
Australia is the second-largest contributor of military forces in the fight against the IS group.
It recently declined a request from the US to increase its troop deployment.
As they went into talks in the Oval Office on Tuesday, Mr Obama said they would discuss "how we can strengthen our co-operation both in Syria and Iraq but also countering violent extremism globally".
"Australia will be a very important partner in that process."
The trip is Mr Turnbull's first official visit to Washington since taking office in September.
"The prosperity of the world and security of the world was founded on the peace and order in the Asia Pacific... underwritten by the United States and its allies," Mr Turnbull said.
