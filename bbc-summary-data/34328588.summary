Coronation Street actress Barbara Knox, who plays Rita Sullivan, is in "fine form" and "poised" for Wednesday's live episode, a producer has told the BBC.

It follows The Mirror's report the soap was "in chaos" after 81-year-old Knox was forced to miss a "crucial rehearsal" after falling ill.
But assistant producer Ella Kelly told BBC Radio 5 Live they had spoken to the actress today, and she is taking part.
The special live episode is to help celebrate ITV's 60th anniversary.
Coronation Street last broadcast a live episode to mark its own 50th anniversary in 2010, attracting more than 14 million viewers.
Kelly told 5 Live's Afternoon Edition with Dan Walker and Sam Walker on Tuesday that the cast and crew were all in "fine form" and "poised for the run-through tonight".
She added: "There's just such a buzz in the building. All the actors in one space is just amazing."
Kelly also spoke about last week's announcement that producer Stuart Blackburn will be leaving at the end of the year, and is being replaced by Emmerdale's Kate Oakes.
"There's no surprise, it's something that happens as part of these shows that people reach the end of their tenure," said Kelly, adding: "We're really sad to see Stuart go."
"He's just seen a wonderful exit for Hayley which brought regularly over 10 million viewers, which is incredible, and two Baftas for us... So it's all mixed emotions really," she said.
When questioned by TV reviewer Kevin O'Sullivan, who was also a guest on 5 Live, Kelly denied the timing of the announcement was "incendiary", coming just ahead of the live episode.
"I think it was absolutely a sensible thing to do, because there [were] obviously lots of rumours about who's going to take over... as always happens after a period of two-and-a-half, three years," she said.
"It felt like it was much better to announce that, and for us all to hear it first, and announce that properly, and then just get on with doing the live and have a fantastic event."
She added she hoped negative press coverage, which has suggested cast members were celebrating the end of Blackburn's tenure, would "go away", adding, "it's all such nonsense".
Kelly said fans could expect "lots of firsts" from Wednesday's live show and that they were being "a little bit daring". She also promised it would be "classic Corrie".
"It will be tension with the Platts, and laughter with the Websters and everyone's poised to see what happens with Roy, and of course farewell to Lloyd and Andrea," she said.
