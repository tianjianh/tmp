Cineworld, its subsidiary Picturehouse and Curzon, which own some 135 cinemas between them, will not screen the film.
Odeon and Vue - the two other biggest chains - will be showing it.
The western, which stars Kurt Russell, Samuel L Jackson and Jennifer Jason Leigh, has had glowing reviews and been nominated for three Golden Globes.
Its distributor, Entertainment Film, said Cineworld and Curzon had decided not to show it because they objected to a deal with Odeon to have the exclusive rights for London's West End.
The Odeon Leicester Square will show the film in a "70mm Ultra Panavision presentation" - a format not used for almost 50 years.
A statement from Entertainment Film said: "Due to the special facilities required for the unique 70mm Ultra Panavision presentation we needed the largest theatre and screen possible in the West End and the Odeon Leicester Square was the natural choice.
"The technical elements and costs involved with this special presentation meant that this would need to be the exclusive West End venue."
Cineworld objected to the fact it could not be shown at one of its West End venues, according to Entertainment Film.
"Cineworld had every opportunity to book the film in their other cinemas across the country on the same basis as other exhibitors and declined to do so," the statement added.
"This is despite the fact that there is no dispute over the financial terms for this release."
Cineworld operates around 100 sites and owns Picturehouse, which runs a further 23 cinemas.
A Cineworld statement said: "We can confirm that The Hateful Eight will not be shown at our cinemas. Unfortunately we were not able to reach an agreement with the movie's distributor."
The distributor said Curzon, meanwhile, was "offered The Hateful Eight in eight out of their 13 sites including the Curzon Victoria but sadly declined due to the 70mm exclusive commitments at the Odeon Leicester Square".
On Twitter, Curzon told fans: "We love a Quentin Tarantino movie but it is with great regret that we will not be showing The Hateful Eight from Friday 8 January.
"On this occasion, the distributor has chosen to screen the film only in 70mm in the West End and in selected venues nationwide."
