Wilson, 24, is the only addition to the 18 women who formed the first group to be given central contracts in 2014.
The right-hander made her international debut in 2010 but has not represented England since 2011.
"She thoroughly deserves to be awarded a central contract," said ECB director of women's cricket Clare Connor.
"She scored significant runs throughout the summer and has been a dedicated member of the England women's performance squad during the past 18 months."
Following defeat by Australia in the multi-format Ashes series earlier this year, England appointed Mark Robinson as head coach in November.
The former Sussex coach's first series in charge will be against South Africa in February 2016, with three one-day internationals followed by three T20 Internationals.
England will also take part in the 2016 World Twenty20 in India, overseas tours to West Indies and Sri Lanka and a home series against Pakistan in what Connor called "the busiest ever 12 months for England women".
She added: "The awarding of central contracts ensures that the squad will be as best prepared and supported as possible for each of those contests."
Full list of centrally contracted professionals:
Charlotte Edwards (capt), Tammy Beaumont, Katherine Brunt, Kathryn Cross, Georgia Elwiss, Natasha Farrant, Lydia Greenway, Rebecca Grundy, Jenny Gunn, Danielle Hazell, Amy Jones, Heather Knight, Laura Marsh, Natalie Sciver, Anya Shrubsole, Sarah Taylor, Lauren Winfield, Fran Wilson, Danielle Wyatt
