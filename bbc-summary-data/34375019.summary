Twin Towers film draws mixed response from critics

A film about Philippe Petit's high-wire walk between the twin towers of the World Trade Center has had its world premiere in New York.

Robert Zemeckis's film The Walk, starring Joseph Gordon-Levitt as Petit, was the opening night film of the New York Film Festival on Saturday.
The film charts Petit's efforts to tightrope between the towers in 1974.
Mixed reviews have seen critics call the film both a "glimmering dream" and "wholly false".
Petit's tale was first committed to film in James Marsh's award-winning 2008 documentary Man on Wire.
Zemeckis's film uses 3D and visual effects to capture the daredevil crossing between the North and South towers - and opens next month with a nine-day run in Imax theatres.
"Robert Zemeckis's glimmering dream of a film, which opens the 2015 New York Film Festival, takes two buildings that have become emblematic of everything that's frightening and uncertain about 21st century life in the West and redeems them," writes Robbie Collin in the Daily Telegraph.
"When the walk itself begins... everything else - the earlier scenes, the screen, the cinema - just melts away," he continues. "Petit is up there and so are you."
"Even when The Walk inspires the eyes, the brain registers little but banality," counters Nigel M Smith, in the Guardian.
"For the whole of its two-hour running time, it plays like a Disney cartoon, right down to the hammy sidekicks who aid Petit on his mission."
"There is no semblance of reality here. As a live action film, The Walk rings wholly false," he determines.
Skill
The US press fell more on the side of Zemeckis's film, with some caveats.
Industry magazine Variety declared The Walk "a thrilling 3D, all-angles view of an experience that, until now, only one man on Earth could claim to have lived".
But Michael Phillips wrote, in the Chicago Tribune, "I cannot say how I'd feel about The Walk if I'd never seen Man on Wire... I can only say The Walk struck me as an honourable good try of an also-ran".
The New York Times seemed to sum up the dichotomy of feeling: "The first half of the movie treads the boundary between mildly irritating and completely unbearable," begins AO Scott, but ultimately concludes that Zemeckis "used all his brazenness and skill to make something that, once it leaves the ground, defies not only gravity, but time as well".
Speaking at the premiere in New York, where the film was rapturously received by the audience, leading man Gordon-Levitt said the film summed up an experience that could not satisfactorily be described by words.
"There is no visual record of the walk, just a few photographs, and this recreation is the first time you're really getting to see it."
