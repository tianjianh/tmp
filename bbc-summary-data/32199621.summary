Ex-City loan striker Danny Philliskirk looked to have made a dramatic return to the Ricoh Arena by giving the Latics a 13th-minute lead from close range.
But, when the referee awarded six minutes of time added on, it inspired City's grand finale.
Striker Frank Nouble lofted a right-wing cross to the far post - and Johnson powered in a header.
On a night when four of their fellow League One strugglers also drew, Coventry moved a little closer to safety, now four points clear of trouble with three games left - although their next game is a trip to newly-promoted Bristol City.
Coventry wasted a great early chance from Nouble's far-post knockdown, when the ball came at an awkward height for Nick Proschwitz, whose looping close-range header was too weak to beat Oldham goalkeeper Joel Coleman.
And they were quickly made to pay from a classic training ground routine when Connor Brown pulled back for Philliskirk to clip home a low left-footed shot from six yards.
But, other than Coleman having to touch over Grant Ward's inswinging corner on the stroke of half time, City produced little threat of note until Johnson's late intervention, leaving them with a record of just one win in six home games under new boss Tony Mowbray.
Coventry manager Tony Mowbray told BBC Coventry & Warwickshire:
"One more will get us over the line. That was the best performance we've put in at home since I came here.
"The fans were great for us. They sucked the ball in. There might have been only 7,000 here but they made that much noise, it made it sound like there were 27,000.
"The Oldham players complained to the ref that Frank Nouble had fouled Connor Brown in the build-up to our equaliser, but I didn't think it was a foul."
