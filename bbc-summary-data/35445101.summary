Connor Wickham: Crystal Palace striker banned for three games

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Crystal Palace striker Connor Wickham has been banned for three matches after admitting a violent conduct charge.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Wickham, 22, elbowed Tottenham defender Jan Vertonghen in the face during the two sides' Premier League match at Selhurst Park on Saturday.
Spurs won 3-1, but Vertonghen suffered a knee injury in the incident.
Despite admitting the charge, Wickham had argued against the standard three-game ban, but the Independent Regulatory Commission rejected that.
The incident happened in the 69th minute of the match as the pair jostled for position when a corner was being taken, with Vertonghen landing awkwardly after being elbowed.
The 28-year-old was immediately subbed and it was later revealed that he had damaged his medial knee ligaments, although Spurs have not stated how long he will be out of action for.
Wickham will miss his side's FA Cup fourth-round tie against Stoke on Saturday, a Premier League game against Bournemouth and either an away match at Swansea or the FA Cup replay against Stoke, if that is required.
Crystal Palace are 11th in the Premier League and this week added former Arsenal, Manchester City and Tottenham striker Emmanuel Adebayor to their squad.
