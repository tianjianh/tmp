Christopher Blaikie stabbed former flatmate Claire Mazzucchi in the neck as she sat eating lunch at Blair Drummond Safari Park near Stirling.
The incident happened in March in the canteen of the popular visitor attraction.
Blaikie, from Livingston, who claimed he had "homicidal thoughts", will be sentenced in January.
The High Court in Glasgow heard Blaikie, 24, and Ms Mazzucchi, 22, both studied psychology at Stirling University. They had been flatmates but Ms Mazzucchi left after feeling uneasy living with Blaikie.
Prosecutor Shirley McKenna told how students from the psychology course were giving a presentation to safari park staff as part of their final year dissertation, with Blaikie and Ms Mazzucchi among the group.
Ms McKenna said there were "no issues" between the pair at the time of the attack on 30 March.
The court was told that during a lunch break in the canteen of the safari park, Blaikie was very quiet and not eating.
He then became "increasingly agitated" and started banging his cutlery. He suddenly got up, walked across to Ms Mazzucchi's table and stood behind her.
Ms McKenna said: "He was seen to put his right hand over her face and wrap his arms around her neck in a headlock position. He made two or three stabbing motions whereby he stabbed her once on the left hand side of her neck with a knife."
As other stunned students became aware of the horror, one jumped up and rugby-tackled Blaikie. The blade, meanwhile, remained in the neck of his hysterical victim before she pulled it out.
Police arrested Blaikie at the safari park as Ms Mazzucchi was taken to hospital. Blaikie confessed to the attack and claimed he had been in an "agitated and nervous mood" which can cause "homicidal thoughts to come out".
Ms Mazzucchi required surgery following the incident, but will be scarred for life and now feels vulnerable.
Blaikie has been diagnosed as suffering from Asperger's Syndrome since the incident.
However, the court was told he did not suffer from a mental illness and was able to "appreciate the wrongfulness of his conduct" at the time.
