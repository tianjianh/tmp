Temporary power supplier Aggreko has maintained its trading guidance for the year, despite reporting a slump in revenue for the first quarter.

In a trading update, the Glasgow-based company said underlying revenue for the quarter was 14% behind last year, with reported revenue down 17%.
It warned that some of its markets continued to be "challenging".
However, it said it still expected pre-tax profits for the year to be "slightly lower" than in 2015.
Aggreko reported that first-quarter revenue for its rental solutions division was down 9% on last year, while its power solutions industrial arm saw revenue fall by 10%. Sales from its power solutions utility division were 19% lower than last year.
Chief executive Chris Weston said Aggreko's performance in the first quarter had been in line with the board's expectations.
In its update, the company said: "As indicated at our full year results in March, the timing of contract start and end dates will have an impact on first half year-on-year profitability.
"Overall the guidance of slightly lower year-on-year profit before tax and exceptional items on a constant currency basis remains unchanged."
In December, Aggreko announced that it had pulled out of bidding for a contract to power the Rio de Janeiro Olympic Games.
The company said it had withdrawn from the bidding because of the size of the event and preparation needed.
