[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Police in Scotland have formally identified the body of the 22-year-old, who was found at a private property in the Forres area on Saturday.
Hobden had been celebrating the New Year with friends at the property on the Moray coast near Inverness. His cause of death remains unexplained.
Post-mortem tests have taken place and a file passed to the Procurator Fiscal.
In a brief statement, Hobden's family asked to "be left alone to deal with the tragic circumstances that have unfolded".
Enquiries into the right-arm bowler's death continue, but Police Scotland say there are not thought to be any suspicious circumstances.
Tributes to Hobden have been made since news of his death emerged. Sussex opened a book of condolence at the county ground in Hove on Monday.
Following on from England's cricketers wearing black armbands as a mark of respect on day two of the second Test against South Africa in Cape Town, players from Australian Big Bash franchises Melbourne Stars and Hobart Hurricanes paid a similar tribute earlier on Wednesday.
Luke Wright, Hobden's captain at Sussex and currently playing for Melbourne, was among them as he scored a half-century.
Hobden made his his first-class debut in 2014 and represented Sussex in all formats of the game.
