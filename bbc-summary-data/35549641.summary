Loch Lomond Sea Life Aquarium to breed shark and ray species

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Loch Lomond Sea Life Aquarium is investing Â£150,000 to breed up to 23 species of sharks and rays.

Staff at the facility in Balloch will transform six display tanks and pools to accommodate the tropical fish.
New species will include a breeding pair of epaulette sharks and Scotland's first shoal of cownose ray.
A nursery to allow visitors to view recently-hatched sharks and rays will also be added, along with a display of marine life in Scotland's lochs.
Curator Mark Hind said the cownose stingrays would be "a fantastic addition" to the centre.
"They swim in formation like an underwater aerobatics team, and are amazing to watch as they appear to flap their wings and fly under water," he said.
"They are fairly chilled out but they have a spine on their tails with a serrated edge on the outside of the sting, which is like a harpoon. It is a defence mechanism, but if you are stung it can cause excruciating pain.
"Some aquariums have been known to remove the barbs, but we won't do that as it's unethical and not good for them. We will work around them."
Mr Hind added: "They are a very strange looking species and people will be able to get up close, without being able to touch.
"We plan to breed them for the first time, along with our other rays and sharks."
