Wolves head coach Walter Zenga says he is experienced enough to take charge of the Championship club despite never managing in England before.

The former Inter Milan goalkeeper, 56, was appointed on Saturday after Kenny Jackett was sacked the previous day.
"Experience is very important in life. I have coached in three continents and eight different countries," he said.
"When you are a citizen of the world and go around the world, you understand the culture. It's not difficult."
Zenga watched from the stands on Saturday as Wolves lost 4-0 to Swansea City at Molineux in their final pre-season friendly before they begin their Championship campaign at Rotherham United on Saturday.
Wolves are the sixteenth side Zenga has managed, after spells in the USA, Romania and most recently the United Arab Emirates, where he coached Al-Shaab for a short spell earlier this year.
Zenga has been given the task of "promotion to the Premier League" after the club were taken over by Chinese conglomerate Fosun International last month.

"Fortunately for me, last year I followed the Championship from February because I was at home and every week I watched it," Zenga told BBC WM.
"It is a competition I love so much because it is like the Premier League. I don't say that I understand everything but some major things are in my mind."
In addition to the signings of goalkeeper Andy Lonergan, winger Helder Costa and defender Silvio, the club are set to sign 22-year-old midfielder Joao Teixeira from Benfica on a season-long loan.
