The RSPCA was called out to catch a stray snake in a loft which turned out to be a child's cuddly toy.

A welfare officer made the discovery at a property in Surrey after being contacted by a distressed homeowner in December.
It is a one of a string of calls made to the animal welfare charity where people have mistaken objects for living creatures.
The RSPCA is urging the public to double check before raising the alarm.
Other call outs include a report in November that an owl had been sitting on a roof for more than four days and appeared unable to move.
Inspectors discovered that the creature was in fact made out of plastic.
A month later animal collection officer Alan Farr was asked by a homeowner to help find a trapped bird which was making a "peeping noise" in her loft.
"After searching around and unable to find the mystery bird, I then went into her front room and found a smoke alarm beeping after the battery had gone flat," he revealed.
Others include:
The charity's 24-hour cruelty line received 1,153,744 calls in 2016, 3% more than the previous year.
It has urged the public to make sure they have a genuine problem before getting in touch.
RSPCA spokesman Dermot Murphy said: "We know that people mean well and most of these calls are not made in malice, and although we would like to be able to help everyone, we simply haven't got the staff to personally investigate each and every issue that the public brings to us.
"We must prioritise to make sure we get to the animals most in need."
