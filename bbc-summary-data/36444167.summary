The 30-year-old, who joined the club in 1995 and became a professional in 2003, made 268 appearances for the Magpies.
"It will be a huge wrench to leave Newcastle but I've been offered exciting opportunities," he said.
Manager Rafael Benitez added: "His character and personality has always been positive, including during difficult times."
Taylor made his first-team debut on 25 March 2004 against Real Mallorca in the Uefa Cup and his Premier League bow against Bolton three days later.
Although Taylor failed to win an England cap, he was called up to the full squad for the friendly against Germany in August 2007.
Newcastle have taken up an option to extend defender Kevin Mbabu's contract for two more years.
The 21-year-old Swiss left-back, who joined the club from Servette in January 2013, made his debut against Sheffield Wednesday in the Capital One Cup in September.
