The Dutchman, 27, won Sunday's final in Minehead 11-3 to clinch his 25th tournament success of 2016.
Van Gerwen survived a scare in his semi-final, coming from 6-0 behind to beat Darren Webster 11-8.
Van Gerwen will be the number one seed for the PDC World Championship, for which the draw takes place on Monday.
"Going into the World Championship, this is a big confidence boost for me," he said.
"What I've done this year is phenomenal and I'm really proud of myself because nobody has won as many tournaments as this before."
Van Gerwen will look to regain the world title he first won in 2014 at London's Alexandra Palace (15 December-2 January), where Scotland's Gary Anderson is the defending champion.
