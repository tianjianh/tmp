Crewe Alexandra manager David Artell says he would like to have had the chance to look for new signings sooner.

Since succeeding Steve Davis on 8 January, Artell's side have suffered two defeats to extend their overall winless run to nine games.
His only signing has been Leyton Orient striker Jordan Bowery on loan.
"We're chasing our tails a bit. I'd have liked a bit more time. This process should have started six to eight weeks ago," said Artell, 36.
He told BBC Radio Stoke: "I'd like to have started in November, doing all the due diligence.
"Then you can be sure you get someone that would benefit us, rather than make a rash decision. We have to make sure we get the right person. When you're coming to it on 9 January with only three weeks, the consequences could be dire.
"I spoke to one person who was out bowling with his daughter. He said he'd call me back and he never has. That told me enough. That's the kind of thing we're up against, but we're still working extremely hard.
"I've been on the phone all day and I'll be working right up to the last minute on Tuesday. I still want to get some people out and in."
Crewe are five points clear of the drop zone in League Two, in danger of relegation for a second successive season and losing their place in the Football League for the first time since 1921.
They host 22nd-placed Cheltenham Town on Saturday.
Artell is also keen to resolve the issue affecting the former manager's son, 25-year-old defender Harry Davis, who has not figured for the Alex in the two games since his father was sacked and is now looking to move on.
"The ball's not in my court. That's the bottom line," said Artell.
"We've had conversations. I've told him my feelings, he's told me his. From what he's told me, he needs to do something about it."
