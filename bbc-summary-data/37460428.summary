Ipswich Town 0-1 Huddersfield Town

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Huddersfield extended their lead at the top of the Championship with victory in an even game at Ipswich thanks to Christopher Schindler's header.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Terriers, who lost their previous two away games, hit the post through Elias Kachunga in the first half.
Schindler's downward header from Aaron Mooy's corner gave the visitors the lead after the break.
Ipswich's Grant Ward volleyed wide from a Leon Best flick-on but they have now won just two of their past 11 games.
Tom Lawrence sent a free-kick just wide for the hosts in the first half, but Mick McCarthy's side lacked a cutting edge in the final third.

They have failed to score in their past four Championship games and have scored just four goals in their past 10 league games since hitting four past Barnsley on the opening day.
Huddersfield's attacks mostly came on the counter and they were content to defend their lead in the second half, but Kachunga was very unlucky not to have opened the scoring earlier when his sweet strike struck the post.
The Terriers have won eight of their first 11 league games and are now 12 points ahead of McCarthy's Ipswich.
Huddersfield Town manager David Wagner:
"I am very surprised as the only teams who could have expected this start is Newcastle, Norwich and Aston Villa.
"But I am not surprised by how my players are working together and how fit they are. In football, it is all about the little details and getting these details right to win games.
"For any manager in the Championship, three points at Ipswich is huge. This is a very difficult place to come against an aggressive team but we stayed in the game and then got our goal."
Ipswich Town manager Mick McCarthy:
"We weren't very good on the ball and we didn't create anything. We have got some injuries but I expect more from the players I had out on the pitch.
"It is difficult at the moment. I am not surprised by the fans' reaction. We did not play as well as we could and the crowd are getting frustrated and venting their feelings.
"I am doing the job to the best of my ability but if we are not as good as the crowd think we should be, then they pay their money and it is up to them if they want to boo. I am not happy with how we played myself."
