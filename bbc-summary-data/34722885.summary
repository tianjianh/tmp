[SN]TITLE[SN]
Doctor guilty of manslaughter over death of boy, six

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A doctor has been found guilty of the manslaughter of a six-year-old boy who was "seriously neglected" in hospital.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Jack Adcock, who had Down's syndrome, died of a cardiac arrest at Leicester Royal Infirmary in February 2011.
Hadiza Bawa-Garba was found guilty of manslaughter by gross negligence. Sister Theresa Taylor was cleared of the same charge.
Agency nurse Isabel Amaro, 47, was found guilty of the same charge on Monday.
Jack, who had a heart condition, was admitted to the hospital with pneumonia but died 11 hours later from a cardiac arrest.
It was caused by sepsis triggered by a bacterial infection.
The trial had heard the boy's death was caused by "serious neglect" by staff who failed to recognise his body was "shutting down" and close to death, the prosecution claimed.
After a month-long trial at Nottingham Crown Court, the jury retired on Thursday last week to consider its verdicts, returning a guilty verdict on Amaro on Monday.
Verdicts on Bawa-Garba and Ms Taylor were returned earlier.
