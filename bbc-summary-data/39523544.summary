[SN]TITLE[SN]
Boreham Wood 1-3 Dagenham & Redbridge

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Dagenham & Redbridge closed in on a National League play-off spot thanks in part to Paul Benson's double in a 3-1 win at Boreham Wood.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Ricky Shakes nodded the hosts in front on 17 minutes, but Morgan Ferrier did the spadework, beating Scott Doe on the left and whipping in a great cross.
Benson came into his own either side of the interval. First, he squared up matters for John Still's men when he prodded in Corey Whitely's cross, despite having his initial effort saved by Grant Smith.
The forward was equally clinical with his head from a Joe Widdowson centre, early in the second half.
Whitely headed in a Curtley Williams cross to rubber-stamp the victory.
