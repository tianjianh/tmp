Many residents are "devastated" at the move, according to a local councillor.
But Shoreline Housing said 52% of locals backed the demolition of the East Marsh blocks and Comber Place maisonettes, while 42% were against it.
A total of 457 flats are affected and will start to be emptied in October, with residents rehomed over the next four years.
Councillor Steve Beasant, who represents people in the East Marsh ward, said: "Residents are devastated at the news.
"They actually thought that Shoreline was beginning to think again about the multi-storey flats."
Shoreline said it would carry out a study by April to find out if it is "affordable and viable" to provide suitable alternative older persons' accommodation.
The company added that its employees at the buildings would also be affected by the demolition decision. A review of staff structure is to be undertaken.
A Shoreline spokesman said: "We strongly believe this is in the best long-term interests of Shoreline so that we can ensure our continuing ability to invest in affordable modern accommodation across the borough for years to come."
