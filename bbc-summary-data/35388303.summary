The attack happened at Ardmonagh Parade and was reported to police shortly after 19:00 GMT on Friday.
The teenager has been taken to hospital for treatment, but his injuries are not thought to be life-threatening.
Sinn FÃ©in MLA Pat Sheehan said those who carried out the attack had "nothing to offer this community other than hurt and intimidation".
"Those responsible need to end these futile and reckless actions immediately," he added.
Police have appealed for anyone with information on the attack to contact them on the non-emergency number 101.
