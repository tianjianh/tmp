Appeal to find last person with missing Briton Richard Cole

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The family of a British man missing in Amsterdam are appealing for the last person he was with to call police.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Richard Cole, 30, from Dursley in Gloucestershire, was travelling from Copenhagen to Assen, in north eastern Netherlands, via the Dutch capital.
His last known location was the Thorbeckepleim area of the city at 02.00 GMT last Monday, police said.
His family said he was in Coco's Outback bar with a Scottish or Irish man who may know where he was heading.
Mr Cole's mother, Debbie Thornhill, said: "The man has probably returned home now, but he may have information of where Richard was going next as his girlfriend - who spoke to him on the phone - said he was keen to carry on clubbing.
"We just want this person to contact police. We need some answers and to know where he went from that spot."
Mr Cole is described as white, about 6ft tall and of slim build. He has short, dark brown hair and was wearing a black Armani or Superdry jacket.
Mrs Thornhill said it was unusual for Richard to not be in touch and, as time passes with no contact, her fears for his safety increase.
"There are no words I can say that can describe how we feel. It's just a nightmare," she said.
Mr Cole's brother Lee has travelled to Amsterdam to visit bars and distribute leaflets as part of the search.
He said he had met with the city's mayor, Eberhard van der Laan, who had been "very sympathetic and very helpful" and wished him luck in finding his brother.
Marjolein Koek, from Dutch police, said they have checked CCTV cameras and conducted inquiries in the area where Mr Cole was last seen.
"We are working very hard to find him," she added.
