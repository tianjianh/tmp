Stephane Smith, born in Brazil but raised in the UK, scored from a penalty corner for the host nation's first ever goal at an Olympics.
But the team ranked 30th in the world were soon overwhelmed as GB struck nine goals without reply.
GB, who had lost to Belgium and drawn with New Zealand in Pool A, are third in the table.
The top four from each group progress to the quarter-finals, with Britain still to play Australia and pool leaders Spain.
Brazil, having shipped 12 goals against Belgium and seven against Spain in their opening fixtures, turned out to be the ideal opponents to give GB a much needed first victory of the Games.
And after the Rio crowd had celebrated the opener for the home side, GB responded with two goals each from Barry Middleton, Sam Ward and Ashley Jackson as well as strikes from Adam Dixon, Harry Martin and Mark Glerghorne.
Australia could have gone above Britain with a win, but Belgium's Tanguy Cosyns struck to secure a 1-0 victory, and Spain top Pool A after a 3-2 victory over New Zealand.
The Netherlands registered an emphatic 7-0 win over Canada in Pool B with Mink van der Weerden scoring three goals, while India beat Argentina 2-1. Pool leaders Germany beat Ireland 3-2 to leave the Irish winless after three games.
