Port Vale: Christopher Mbamba & Paulo Tavares leave by mutual consent

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Port Vale winger Christopher Mbamba and midfielder Paulo Tavares have left the relegated League One club by mutual consent.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Both joined Vale last summer but Mbamba made only 11 appearances in 2016-17, while Tavares featured 26 times.
Meanwhile, 19-year-old defender James Gibbons has agreed a new one-year deal.
The full-back made his debut as a substitute in Vale's 4-0 win against Hartlepool in the FA Cup in December, but is yet to play a league game.
