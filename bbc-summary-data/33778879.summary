[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Two Belfast men have appeared in court charged over the death of a teenage student who was knocked down in the city last year.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Enda Dolan, 18, from Killyclogher, County Tyrone, died after he was hit by a van on the Malone Road on 15 October.
David Lee Stewart, 30, of Grays Park Avenue, faced charges of causing death by dangerous driving and causing death by careless driving while unfit.
William Ross Casement of Belvoir Drive is charged with assisting an offender.
The 20-year-old is also charged with aiding and abetting in failing to remain at the scene of an accident.
Mr Stewart is further accused of failing to stop and failing to remain at the scene of an accident causing injury.
Mr Casement is also accused of a separate indecent behaviour incident in the vicinity of Donegall Square East on 15 October.
Both men were released on continuing bail to return to court next month.
Mr Dolan was a first-year architecture student at Queen's University in Belfast. He had been returning to his student flat when the incident happened.
A crash barrier that residents living near the scene of the collision said would have saved his life had been removed less than a month before his death.
The Department for Regional Development later installed new safety measures at the spot where Mr Dolan was killed.
