O'Shea, 34, is banned for Friday's first leg in Zenica and may miss the second leg with a hamstring injury.
Long, 28, who has an ankle injury, also stays in Martin O'Neill's squad, which was reduced to 30 on Sunday evening.
Injured duo Shay Given and David McGoldrick are among nine men to drop out from the original extended squad.
Veteran Stoke keeper Given, 39, is still not fit after picking up a knee injury in the Republic's shock qualifier win over Germany in October while Ipswich striker McGoldrick, 27, has a groin problem.
Preston defender Greg Cunningham is cut from the squad along with Bournemouth midfielder Eunan O'Kane, Rotherham's Paul Green, Cardiff's Anthony Pilkington plus strikers Anthony Stokes, Adam Rooney and Simon Cox.
Newcastle goalkeeper Rob Elliot, Reading defender Paul McShane and Brentford midfielder Alan Judge have minor injuries and will be assessed by their clubs in the early part of the week.
Sunderland boss Sam Allardyce indicated on Saturday he was certain Sunderland defender O'Shea would be unfit for the play-off second leg on 16 November after missing his club's defeat by Southampton.
"He's not going to get fit in 10 days with a hamstring injury," said the Sunderland boss.
"He will be talking to them - the Republic - but I wouldn't have thought that, with the recurrence in his hamstring, he would be anywhere near available."
O'Shea, who has 108 Republic caps, has not played since damaging his hamstring in the 3-0 derby win over Newcastle on 25 October.
Southampton's Long was also not deemed fit enough to play for his club in Saturday's game against Sunderland.

Goalkeepers: David Forde (Millwall), Keiren Westwood (Sheffield Wednesday), Darren Randolph (West Ham United), Rob Elliot (Newcastle United).
