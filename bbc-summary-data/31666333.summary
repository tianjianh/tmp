Six thousand patients in Brighton have been left trying to find a new doctor after talks to safeguard the future of their surgery broke down.

The Eaton Place surgery closed its doors for the last time at lunchtime because its two partners are retiring.
Local Conservative MP Simon Kirby, who had campaigned for it to remain open, said he was very disappointed.
NHS England said patients would be able to register with other nearby practices at a drop-in event next week.
At least half the patients have already registered with one of the 13 surgeries closest to Eaton Place.
NHS England has offered the surgeries a payment of Â£25 per head for every patient they take.
Mr Kirby, the MP for Brighton Kemptown and Peacehaven, had hoped another GP would take on the practice and said discussions had been so advanced that the recruitment process for new staff had already begun.
"It is particularly saddening that the final discussions between these various groups have not been successful," he said.
Patients wishing to register with another GP can visit the Wellsbourne Health Centre, in Whitehawk, on 4 March between 10:00 and 14:00 GMT.
