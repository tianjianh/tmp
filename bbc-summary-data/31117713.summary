Reinventing the Royals was due to air on 4 January, but was pulled from the schedule after problems emerged regarding the use of archive footage.
The documentary investigates the Royal Family's relationship with the media.
A BBC spokesperson said all clearance issues "have now been resolved" and the original programme will be aired.
Written and presented by media analyst Steve Hewlett, the first episode will look at how Prince Charles hired spin doctor Mark Bolland who worked to improve his public image following the death of Diana, Princess of Wales.
The series will also examine Princes William and Harry's relationship with the media following the death of their mother and how the monarchy has changed in the age of the internet.
A BBC spokeswoman said: "The first episode of Reinventing The Royals will be broadcast on 19 February and it will be the one that we always intended to show."
