The Maritime and Coastguard Agency was alerted to the fire in the hold of the Maltese-registered bulk carrier "V Due" on Thursday at 16:30 GMT.
The 23,000 tonne ship, which had sailed from Liverpool, is 181m (593ft) long and has dropped anchor four miles away from the village of Moelfre.
The ship is said to be stable and there are no reports of any pollution.
The coastguard said salvors are currently on board the vessel to carry out an assessment.
