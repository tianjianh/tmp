West Midlands Ambulance Service said the incident was initially sparked shortly before 13:00 GMT after a woman reported feeling ill and it "quickly became apparent" she was suffering from the effects of carbon monoxide poisoning.
Ambulance officials added: " "A number of other patients then began coming forward. Ambulance staff worked quickly to assess them all in order to establish the severity of their conditions."
