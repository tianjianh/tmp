The Andy Coulson trial: Why the truth didn't matter

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Former News of the World editor and government communications chief Andy Coulson has walked free from the High Court in Edinburgh after the perjury trial against him collapsed.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The case had twisted and turned across several weeks, with Lord Burns finally ruling that Mr Coulson had no case to answer on the charge brought by the Crown.
This was Scotland's first perjury trial for five years - the first since the Tommy Sheridan trial in 2010, which was where the allegations against Mr Coulson originated.
The 47-year-old was accused of committing perjury when he denied knowing about phone hacking at the paper prior to the arrest of his royal editor Clive Goodman and Glenn Mulcaire, a private investigator, in August 2006.
But when it came down the issue which decided his trial, it didn't matter what Mr Coulson knew and when; it didn't even matter whether he had really broken his sworn oath to tell "the truth and nothing but the truth" or not.
It was the definition of perjury itself which saw the case thrown out.
The background to the trial stretched back almost 10 years, to a defamation action brought against Mr Coulson's News of the World paper by former Scottish Socialist politician Tommy Sheridan.
Mr Sheridan won Â£200,000 at the civil proceedings in 2006, but was later charged with lying under oath when he testified that he had not visited a Manchester swingers club - the subject of a series of stories in the Sunday red-top. He stood trial at the High Court in Glasgow, was convicted and was jailed.
Mr Coulson's perjury case hinged on evidence given by the former newspaper editor - then the director of communications for the Westminster government - when he was called as a witness during that trial and questioned about phone hacking.
No reference could be made in court to the fact Mr Coulson was jailed in 2014 for conspiracy to hack phones. The jury was was told to put any preconceptions out of their mind and key witnesses warned not to refer to previous proceedings.
One landmark feature of the case was that for the first time, the use of "live text based communications" was permitted from within a Scottish courtroom throughout a trial, allowing reporters to tweet live from the court.
This raised challenges of its own - the notoriously spotty signal coverage in court three being one; crafting legally safe, fair reporting within a scant 140 characters at a time being another.
However, the most vital exchanges of the trial took place without a jury present, as part of a legal submission by the defence - which could not be tweeted or reported until after the trial.
At the end of the day, the case rested on a combination of the legal definition of perjury and details of Tommy Sheridan's trial for that same offence.
In order to constitute perjury, false testimony has to be relevant to the case at hand; in essence, the lies told have to matter to the jury.
Thus, while the prosecution set out to prove that Mr Coulson had known about phone hacking at his paper far earlier than he had claimed under oath, the defence simply set out to prove that it didn't matter either way.
And in this regard, it seemed the defence team had stolen a march.
The onus is on the Crown to prove the relevance of the supposedly false evidence, Murdo MacLeod QC told Lord Burns. In his submission, the prosecution had done no such thing.
They could have called the Advocate Depute from the 2010 trial; they could even have called Mr Sheridan himself, he suggested.
They had not.
All they had done was hear extracts from Mr Coulson's testimony, before moving on to hear details about phone hacking from a trio of former News of the World journalists, all convicted phone hackers themselves.
With the jury out of the room as the no case to answer submission was heard - they were told a "legal matter" was being debated - the present Advocate Depute, Richard Goddard, hit back.
He argued that Mr Coulson's evidence had in fact been relevant to the case; perhaps not all of it, on the issue of phone hacking, but he had said enough of importance to the jury that any other lies he might tell could impact on his credibility.
How could the jury make a fair judgement based on Mr Coulson's testimony when he had given false evidence on other matters, Mr Goddard asked?
This was important because the Sheridan trial at the outset had little if anything to do with phone hacking. Mr Sheridan was on trial for perjuring himself during his successful defamation action against the News of the World.
But part-way through the 2010 trial, Mr Sheridan dismissed his legal team and went it alone, representing himself. He immediately called Mr Coulson, who had not originally been cited as a witness for the proceedings, to the stand.
Mr Sheridan wanted to make a number of points in his questioning of Mr Coulson. Firstly, he suggested that the so-called "McNeilage tape", a recording purporting to bear evidence of him admitting visiting the swingers club, had been fabricated by the News of the World.
The former politician also alleged that his phone had been hacked, and that the paper had been conspiring against him, to "do him in".
Mr Coulson denied all of this, stating that he had known nothing of phone hacking until the arrests of Goodman and Mulcaire in 2006 - thus forming the basis of the 2015 perjury action against him.
But crucially, even Mr Sheridan himself admitted during his closing speech that the questioning of Mr Coulson might be irrelevant to his own case.
He said: "There are other issues that have to be considered about conduct in public life, about power, about who can do things and who can break the law and get away with it.
"The reason I risked my defence to cite the likes of Glenn Mulcaire and Andy Coulson to give evidence wasn't because I thought they were going to help my defence, it was because I think I have a public service and a public duty to expose wrongdoing."
Such statements from Mr Sheridan and indeed the Advocate Depute from that case were enough for Mr MacLeod; he was able to point to them, alongside the lack of effort to prove relevance, as fatal flaws in the Crown case.
"All we have here, if I may say so without denigrating the Advocate Depute," he intoned, "is a rather desperate attempt to make a silk purse out of a pig's ear."
Debates on the matter of relevance and an additional point about corroboration dragged on for two days, after which the jury traipsed back into court three only to be sent out again less than a minute later as Lord Burns adjourned for the weekend to think things over.
When Lord Burns returned his written judgement on Monday, it was the death knell for the Crown case. He said he simply had not been given enough evidence by the Crown to judge whether Mr Coulson's testimony had been relevant, and as such whether it could constitute perjury.
Mr Coulson was acquitted, but this was suspended for 48 hours for the Crown to consider whether there was anything in the complex judgement which could be challenged at the Court of Criminal Appeal. But Mr Goddard could see no grounds to overturn the ruling; the game was up.
The jury of nine men and six women returned to the court to discover that they would not be passing judgement on Andy Coulson after all.
During the Crown case they had heard evidence from Clive Goodman, Neville Thurlbeck and James Weatherup, all testifying that Mr Coulson had been aware of what Mr Weatherup called the "systematic culture of phone hacking at the News of the World".
But at the end of the day, the court ruled that whether that was true or not, it just didn't matter.
As Mr MacLeod underlined repeatedly in his legal submission, this trial had been about perjury, not phone hacking; and it was that which the Crown had failed to prove.
Questions will now be asked about how much the case cost, and why it came to court in the form it did in the first place.
