Food boxes, which the school says can feed a family of four for a week, are being put together by the chef at Hillstone Primary in Birmingham.
Head teacher Gillian Sparrow said the idea came following concerns about childhood obesity.
The Shard End ward, where the school is based, has high levels of childhood obesity.

Head teacher Gillian Sparrow, said: "We are concerned about childhood obesity, as many schools are, so we wanted to encourage healthy eating in the community."
The school buys in extra ingredients and sells them on directly to parents. Around 15 have taken part so far.
Boxes cost Â£22 and contain ingredients for five meals.
Meals are devised by catering manager Matthew Knight and have included cottage pie, chicken pie and chicken burritos.
Ms Sparrow said it was hoped the scheme would "transform the children's eating habits" as well as save money for parents.
She added: "It's going well and growing."
Across the West Midlands, one in four pupils are overweight or obese by the time they start primary school. That number has gone up to one in three by the time they leave.
