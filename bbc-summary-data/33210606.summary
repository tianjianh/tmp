[SN]TITLE[SN]
East Midlands Trains services disrupted

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
East Midlands Trains services to and from London are being disrupted while improvement work is carried out.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Trains will start and finish at Luton with replacement buses to London St Pancras on Saturday and Sunday.
Services from Sheffield and Derby to Luton will be reduced to one per hour and are likely to be busier than usual.
The work, which includes replacing track near Derby, will "improve reliability and increase services in the long-run", the firm said.
East Midlands Trains (EMT) said the engineering work will "help pave the way" for electric trains on the route.
