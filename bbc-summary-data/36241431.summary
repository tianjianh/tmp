[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 37-year-old, from London, died at the scene on the eastbound carriageway near junction 11, Reading, at around 14:10 BST on Saturday.
A man in his late thirties and two girls aged three and five were also travelling in the car.
They were taken to the John Radcliffe hospital in Oxford, where the children remain. The man was discharged.
The eastbound carriageway was closed for up to four hours while investigation work took place, causing long delays.
Det Sgt Ashley Hannibal said: "This was a single-vehicle collision in which, sadly, a woman in her 30s died.
"I would like to take the opportunity to thank the many members of the public who stopped and helped immediately after the collision prior to the arrival of the emergency services."
