A judge in Spain has agreed to formally investigate five British men following the death of a Scottish woman in Benidorm in April.

Kirsty Maxwell, from Livingston, died following a fall from the 10th floor of a hotel in the Spanish resort.
A lawyer for Ms Maxwell's family has said the men were in the room when she fell.
The 27-year-old had recently got married and was in the resort with a group of friends on a hen party.
Following her death, a British man was arrested but then later released by Spanish authorities.
Her husband, Adam Maxwell, described her as his best friend and said he will never stop missing her.
