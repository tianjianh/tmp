The 31-year-old, who beat defending champion Nicol David in the last eight, will face Nour el Tayeb in the final as she attempts to add to her 2011 title.
Massaro, who came into the match with a 10-3 negative head-to-head record against Kawy, won 12-10 11-7 11-9 in 34 minutes.
"I'm thrilled to be in a major final once again," said Massaro.
"I've watched Nour play this week and she's in great form.
"I'm really excited. There won't be any pressure on me so I'm just looking forward to it."
