Owens has an ankle problem and Ball has not recovered from a shoulder injury.
Head coach Wayne Pivac had hoped both players would be fit for the final, but says neither will recover in time to take on the Irish province.
Pivac said 2017 British and Irish Lions squad member Owens "won't be right in time" and Ball's "shoulder is still problematic".

Owens has been released to prepare for the Lions tour to New Zealand while Pivac says Ball's injury is being dealt with by Scarlets' and Wales' medics.
Ball is in the Wales squad that will play tour Tests against Tonga and Samoa in June.
"Our medical team is in discussions with Wales at the moment [about Ball] and they will sort out what they do going forward," said Pivac.
"But he won't be right in time this weekend."

Scarlets could also be without wing Steffan Evans after he was sent off in their 25-17 Pro12 semi-final win over Irish side Leinster for a tip tackle.
Pivac said Evans was "a broken man" after being sent off and hopes the dismissal will be deemed sufficient punishment at his disciplinary hearing on Wednesday.
"He was devastated. Some people take that sort of incident on the chin," added Pivac, who had no complaints over the sending-off.
We believe that we can go all the way and we're definitely not here to just make up the numbers
"He was a broken man. He felt at the time he was sent off he might have cost the team an entire season's work.
"For a young player to feel like that it's an uncomfortable position to be in.
"He took it very hard and was probably the most relieved man in Dublin on Friday night.
"Personally I would like to think the sending-off is sufficient because I know what he has been through on Friday night."
Pivac vowed Scarlets "will leave no stone unturned" at the disciplinary hearing.
"Technically it was adjudged 100% right by the referee," added Pivac.
"It's black and white these days - if you go over the horizontal, it's just then looking at what part of the body the player lands on.
"There is only millimetres in it, but his head hit the ground so it's a straight red card and we had no arguments.
"Our focus is representing Steff and making sure he gets the most help possible because we want him for the final."
