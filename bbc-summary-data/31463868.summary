Armando Iannucci tax claim sparks UKIP donor legal threat

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
UKIP donor Arron Banks has threatened to sue the satirist Armando Iannucci, over remarks The Thick of It creator made on BBC One's Question Time.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Mr Iannucci accused Mr Banks of owning a firm in Belize and being the director of a company with a turnover of £19m which paid £12,000 in corporation tax.
Mr Banks has denied owning a company in Belize or seeking to avoid UK tax "via any device" and said he would sue if he did not get an apology within a week.
Mr Iannucci has not yet responded.
The comedian was on Thursday night's programme during a discussion on tax avoidance.
Responding to a comment by UKIP deputy chairman Suzanne Evans, Mr Iannucci said: "When I said they're all in it together, I did really mean they are all in it together.
"UKIP has Arron Banks donating a million pounds, and he has got a company in Belize. He is the director of a firm that had a turnover of £19.7m but paid £12,000 in corporation tax because £19.6m was actually an administrative expense."
Writing on Facebook, Mr Banks said the comments were "clearly defamatory".
What Arron Banks said on Facebook
Arron Banks wrote:  "Apparently some Italian / Scottish comedian accused me of being a tax dodger ! Here was my Dear Mr Lanucci,
I understand you mentioned me on question time in connection with the use of Belizean/ overseas companies to reduce my tax bill including a company in Belize and a service company.
I do not own any companies in Belize so this comment is clearly defamatory.
I believe it is recycling an old guardian story which was incorrect - I have made charitable donations to the Belize children's hospital and hosted a function for them.
This was for a cancer charity.
Meanwhile the service company mentioned is in respect of mainly UK staff and expenses incurred and does not save any UK tax.
The company does not produce revenue. I have created over 5,000 local jobs in South Gloucestershire and donated over a million pounds to charity including, local churches, facilities for schools, scouts, cubs, cricket and hockey clubs and local sports clubs in the area.
I paid £2m pounds in tax , over the last two years - probably more than most Italians one imagines.
Particularly funny ones. I do not own any Belizean companies or seek to avoid UK tax via any device - I expect an apology within 7 days or proceedings will follow.
Best regards
Arron
Ps love the thick of it !"
Ms Evans posted a reply on Facebook to Mr Banks's statement which said: "So pleased you have posted this.
"I was obviously completely unaware of the truth or otherwise of allegations so couldn't really say much. I hope he apologies to you forthwith and will publicise widely."
Mr Banks replied: "No worries - he seems to get his information from the guardian (hardly a reliable source)
"Hope you had a good time on Qt !! Up the revolution".
A spokeswoman for BBC News said the organisation would not comment.
Attempts so far to speak to Arron Banks and Armando Iannucci have not been successful.
