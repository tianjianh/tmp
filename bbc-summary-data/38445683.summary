An early converted Dean Hammond try and three Ryan Mills penalties saw dominant Worcester lead 16-0 at half-time.
Ben Te'o's unconverted try early in the second period increased the lead as Quins failed to show any attacking impetus in the opening 60 minutes.
Charlie Matthews got a try back for Quins, but Mills' fourth penalty sealed it before Alofa Alofa's late try.
Tim Swiel's late penalty from in front of the Worcester posts ensured a losing bonus point for Quins.
The victory was a vital one for Worcester, who lost at bottom side Bristol on Boxing Day and saw their relegation rivals win at fellow strugglers Sale.
Worcester did not look like a side who had only won once all season as they bossed the first half, with Hammond's try and the three penalties from Mills just reward for a confident and disciplined approach.
The home side did lose Darren Barry to the sin-bin after 31 minutes, but Quins could not take advantage and lost England prop Joe Marler to a yellow card just before the break.
Warriors took advantage of the extra man as a flowing move ended with Te'o going over for his fourth try of the season before Mills missed the conversion and a subsequent penalty.
Quins finally came to life in the final 20 minutes, but it was too little too late as Worcester ended a three-month wait for a league win.
Meanwhile, Warriors have confirmed the return of former Wales international forward coach Phil Davies to the club in a coaching role.
Davies, who was Warriors forwards coach between 2010 and 2012 and is now coach of Namibia, has rejoined the club on 'a short-term secondment'.
Worceser head coach Carl Hogg: "After Bristol it was a tough week but we had to come out fighting as we put ourselves in a corner.
"Our endeavour and spirit was outstanding in an attritional game but every match is tough and results are decided on tight margins.
"Ben Te'o was great and he's a very good player who today showed his commitment to the club."
Harlequins director of rugby John Kingston: "We've got to be more competitive though we were excellent in the last 15 minutes.
"We deserve to be where we are in the table as we are too inconsistent, we have tried to change our preparation for away games but it didn't work as we had a poor start.
"Worcester played really well as there are no weak sides in the division and there was no shock in their ability to perform."
