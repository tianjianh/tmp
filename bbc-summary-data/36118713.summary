[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Part-time Braintree Town secured a National League play-off place by beating Altrincham, whose relegation was confirmed by defeat in Essex.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Grimsby and Dover both lost their final games, meaning Braintree finished third and will have a home second leg in their semi-final against Grimsby.
Striker Michael Cheek netted twice for the hosts before half-time and Mitch Brundle added a third from close range.
Altrincham needed to win to stand any chance of survival.
A 5-0 home win over Welling in their previous outing, which ended a seven-match winless run, gave them hope of an unlikely escape but Alty will return to the sixth tier of English football next season after two years in the National League.
Braintree, who are managed by PE teacher Danny Cowley, are aiming to reach the Football League for the first time in their history.
