They were discovered in a double bed among the ruins of an isolated farm cottage in Reigate, on Tuesday morning, Surrey Police said.
Officers were called to the property in Trumpets Hill Road following concerns for the safety of the occupants.
On arrival, at about 11:10 GMT, they found the building had suffered serious fire damage. It is believed the fire had burned all night.
An investigation into the cause of the blaze is under way.
Next of kin have been informed of the deaths.
Resident Christine Beard said: "The houses are few and far between here so we weren't aware of anything.
"The police have been round but I don't think they know how the fire started or what time it started.
"It's terrible news. We had seen comings and goings from there with horses, and had taken in the odd parcel for them, but that's it."
