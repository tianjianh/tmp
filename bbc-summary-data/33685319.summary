A man who shot two ducks with a longbow, killing one and injuring another, is being sought by police.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
One of the birds, a Muscovy duck named George, is recovering after the attack in Buckfastleigh, Devon, despite the 2ft (60cm) arrow piercing his wing and entering his body.
Witnesses saw a man leaving the scene by the River Dart with a longbow and a dead mallard duck.
Police believe George was shot on Saturday.
Pam Barrett and Alan Gosling, who together have looked after the ducks unofficially for several years, went to the river after they were told of the attack on George.
Mrs Barrett said: "The arrow had gone through his wing and into his body.
"We're monitoring George everyday as we're worried he will get an infection.
"Although it has cut his body, we don't think it has damaged any organs."
She enlisted the help of friends John Hytche and Ian Pitchford to get to George in the river.
She said Mr Pitchford found two other arrows embedded in the riverbank.
"If they had been a few feet in either direction they would have been into the traffic."
Mrs Barrett said George and the other muscovy ducks were "such characters, very friendly and attract lots of attention".
A police spokesman said the arrow had been removed and it was now a "waiting game" to see if George recovered.
He said the wanted man was white, in his early 20s, and slim with collar-length light brown hair, and was wearing a black hooded sweatshirt and jeans.
