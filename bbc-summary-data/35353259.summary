The university is hoping to secure half the cash it needs in lottery funding to transform the original home of the college, established in 1872.
The Grade I listed building will be turned into a centre for heritage, learning and enterprise.
Heritage Lottery officials will make a final bid assessment in March.
College officials say they want the renovation scheme to turn the Old College into a facility bringing together both academia and the public in Aberystwyth.
"We want to encourage closer 'town-gown' relationships and to provide a fantastic facility for showcasing learning, research and enterprise opportunities that will inspire users and visitors and boost the economy," said Louise Jagger, director of development.
A final public meeting before the funding assessment will take place on Thursday in the Old College.
