Uni's £6m S4C creative hub gap 'disappointing'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A funding gap for a university-led creative industries hub housing S4C's new headquarters in Carmarthen is "disappointing", says economy minister Ken Skates.

The University of Wales, Trinity Saint David, wants the Welsh Government to give it a grant of between £4m and £6m for the Canolfan yr Egin project.
The minister said European funding issues were to blame for the shortfall.
But he insisted any grant would rely on the project delivering "added value".
He told AMs on Tuesday that the business case for the grant bid needed to demonstrate "additionality" and the creation of jobs "not otherwise generated" by the Welsh language TV broadcaster's move from Cardiff to Carmarthen.
The minister said it was important to note that the funding request for the wider creative hub was separate from the S4C relocation and he hoped the funding issue would be resolved "very soon".
The bid for fresh cash prompted one north Wales assembly member to call for a rethink on housing S4C in Carmarthen - suggesting a previous bid by Caernarfon in Gwynedd should be reconsidered.
