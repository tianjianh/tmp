Tories told off for Twitter spat on M4 motorway policy

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Three Welsh Conservative AMs have been "spoken to" by their leader for arguing about the party's M4 policy on Twitter.

Byron Davies asked if a message from William Graham supporting the so-called "black route" for a Â£1bn Newport relief road came from a "spoof" account, as party policy was to review the options.
Antoinette Sandbach accused Mr Graham of "not willing to put his vote where his principles allegedly are".
Group leader Andrew RT Davies said the online row would "not be repeated".
Mr Graham backed a Conservative motion in the Senedd in January calling for a review of the possible routes for an M4 relief road.
But following the debate he tweeted: "I am confident that when the public inquiry is held the 'black route' will be chosen", referring to the Welsh government's preferred option.
Some critics have claimed other routes would cause less environmental damage.
It prompted responses from two of Mr Graham's colleagues asking whether he supported or disagreed with Conservative policy to review the alternatives.
Group leader Andrew RT Davies told journalists on Tuesday he had "spoken to" each of the members who were "all signed up to the group position".
"If people want to go on to Twitter to have a tittle-tattle that's neither here nor there," he said.
"The people involved know my views on it and I'm confident it won't be repeated."
