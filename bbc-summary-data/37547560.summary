US election 2016: Our daily dig from campaign trail

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]

There are bad days, terrible days and then there are the kind of days that Donald Trump just endured.
He ended Monday by defending his tax arrangements as a "brilliant" way of navigating the law, as a furore raged over the possibility that he had not paid federal tax for 18 years. But tax wasn't the only fire for him to douse, as his charitable foundation has been ordered by New York's attorney general to stop fundraising in the state, after prosecutors concluded it didn't have the proper registration.

Last week, it was the presidential candidates who entered the debating ring for the first time - on Tuesday, it's the turn of their vice-presidential picks. Mike Pence and Tim Kaine will hold their one and only debate in Farmville, Virginia, at 21:00 local time (01:00 GMT on Wednesday).

Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson has now picked up endorsements from at least six US newspapers, two of which have come since he had his latest memory lapse last week (in case you don't remember, he struggled to name a single world leader he admired).
For the record, Donald Trump has yet to receive a single newspaper endorsement, and plenty of papers that have traditionally backed Republicans have given their support to Mrs Clinton.
