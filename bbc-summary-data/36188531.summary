Burnley promoted: Sean Dyche hails 'business-like' Premier League return

Burnley manager Sean Dyche believes the club's "business-like" approach to their Championship campaign paid off.

A Sam Vokes header in a 1-0 win against QPR at Turf Moor on Monday guaranteed the Clarets an immediate return to the top flight with one game to spare.
"We've balanced the books and been successful again," Dyche told BBC Radio Lancashire. "I couldn't be more proud."
Burnley reported profits of Â£30.1m in March, following their 2014-15 season in the Premier League.
They broke their transfer record to sign striker Andre Gray from Brentford in August, having recouped sizeable fees from the departures of Danny Ings to Liverpool, Kieran Trippier to Tottenham and Jason Shackell to Derby.
Dyche said the amount of money spent by other clubs had made the Championship "a different league this year", adding: "People have been having a real go this season financially, putting money into it."
Asked about the challenge of the Premier League, Dyche told BBC Radio 5 live: "We'll be written off immediately.
"I asked two years ago (when Burnley were promoted in 2014) for people to give us 24 hours to enjoy it, before they started slaughtering us and telling us we've got no chance.
"If they could just be lenient and give us maybe 48 hours this time, that would be nice."
Burnley, who are unbeaten in 22 league games since a 3-0 defeat by Hull on Boxing Day, will clinch the Championship title with victory in their final game at already-relegated Charlton on Saturday.
Either Brighton or Middlesbrough will be promoted automatically alongside the Clarets - they play each other at the Riverside on Saturday, with a draw good enough for Middlesbrough.
Burnley produced a long undefeated run to seal promotion after an indifferent first half of the campaign, which saw them eight points adrift of the automatic promotion places on Boxing Day.
Former Watford manager Dyche, who masterminded Burnley's return to the Premier League just 359 days after they left it, said the Championship presented a "different challenge" from when the club last won promotion in 2014.
Dyche added: "The expectation rises from everyone, the money available to the club for its future - all of the things that it brings.
"The mentality of the players has been firm all year. We were questioned heavily around Christmas, but I never blinked.
"I knew what we were about, I knew the group we'd got, I knew the mentality and I knew we could go all the way.
"Last time we were under the radar, it was a fairytale. This one was organised, it was business-like and it was well-fashioned from all involved, especially the players."
Dyche's sentiments were shared by striker Gray, who has scored 22 league goals for the Clarets this season.
"It's crazy, it's been a hard-fought year and the last five or six games have been very tough," he told BBC Radio 5 live.
"It was a bit nervy as we knew the Brighton result and knew we needed to win. We got over the line in the end."
Centre-back Ben Mee, who has been an ever-present this season, added: "All the boys have been immense and everyone has contributed to this.
"We'll enjoy this, but we want to go and win the league now. That is the next step."
