Alex Dowsett out to regain hour record from Sir Bradley Wiggins

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Alex Dowsett will attempt to regain the UCI hour record from fellow British cyclist Sir Bradley Wiggins.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Wiggins' ride of 54.526km in June 2015 at the Lee Valley VeloPark overhauled previous record holder Dowsett's ride of 52.937km a month prior.
Commonwealth time-trial champion Dowsett, 26, hopes to regain the record in early 2017 in Manchester.
Dowsett said in June that his own attempt was a "very conservative race and I could have gone faster".
Wiggins became only the sixth rider to win the Tour de France and claim the hour record when he set a new mark in London.
