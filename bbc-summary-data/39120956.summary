The number of females playing rugby union grew significantly in the aftermath of England's World Cup victory in 2014 and the RFU want to double the number of current participants to 50,000.
RFU director of professional rugby Nigel Melville said: "This is another significant development for women's rugby in this country.
"Women's Super Rugby will drive standards in the game, both domestically and at an elite level, and continue to encourage more women and girls to play the sport.
"We now have the opportunity to build a world-class domestic competition, with the backing and funding of the RFU, demonstrating the union's commitment to growing the game at all levels."
