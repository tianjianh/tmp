BBC Music Awards: The fun stuff celebs said on the red carpet

Pharrell Williams was the big winner at the first ever BBC Music Awards.

He picked up the gong for international artist of the year, beating the likes of Taylor Swift and Dolly Parton to the prize.
And his number one hit Happy won song of the year, the only award voted for by the public.
Ed Sheeran meanwhile won British artist of the year at the event in London's Earls Court, beating the favourite - Sam Smith.
There was one other award given to Catfish and The Bottlemen for BBC Introducing act of the year.
But rather than go through the obvious thank yous, here's the fun stuff they said on the red carpet.
We all have guilty pleasures and Labrinth is no different - his secret joy is a cookery programme.
"We drove over [to the ceremony] watching Come Dine With Me," he said.
"That show, I don't know why, is a guilty pleasure for me, I just have to watch it, but it is really bad. It's terrible. It's trash TV but I love it.
"I think if they didn't have that commentator [Dave Lamb], I probably wouldn't watch it. He's the best."
However, he admits he will never go on the celebrity version as he is an awful cook.
"I'd probably kill everyone by burning down the house," he explained.
He picked up the night's big award, so surely that puts Ed Sheeran in the running to sing the next Bond theme right?
Well, he's not so keen.
"I am a James Bond fan but I think the James Bond theme should be ballsy," he explained.
"I feel like if I was to do it, it would sound a bit wet.
"The Hobbit song was perfect for me to do because it was a bit folky, rootsy and guitar driven. And a hairy short man should have done it."
So who should sing the Bond theme?
"Sam Smith."
Safe bet Ed.
Sigma - that's Cameron Edwards and Joe Lenzie - were pretty excited to be at the awards and be able to hang out backstage.
"Backstage we are next to Take That," Joe Lenzie told Newsbeat.
"Harry Styles gave me the nod as he walked past earlier. I nodded back and said 'What's up?' You don't want to overdo it, play it cool right?"
Zayn had reverted to his slicked-back hair with a loose strand over his forehead.
It's a hairdo that has even got its own Twitter feed.
"It's tweeting right now," Liam suggested on the red carpet and Niall wanted to know if it tickled.
"No it doesn't," explained Zayn. "It's just a piece of hair.
"I am little bit surprised by the reaction to my new hair but it's very flattering and I am very thankful that people are taking so much interest in my singular strand of hair."
Calvin Harris made a rare appearance on a red carpet, saying it was important to be here and support the BBC.
"The first time I was played on the radio was by Pete Tong back in the summer of 2006," he explained.
"Then it just went from there and Radio 1 have always played my records and I've been eternally grateful."
Aww, you're welcome Calvin.
Ellie is another artist who benefitted from early support from the BBC.
She won the Sound of 2010 and has gone on to win Brits and break America.
Ellie has also always had a passion for running and thought this would be a good combination for a video for the BBC Sound of Poll.
"All the other artists did them in the studio or doing a gig," she explained, dressed head to toe in Jean Paul Gaultier.
"Mine was running around my local park with the weirdest hat on and an old charity shop jumper.
"I don't know why I thought that would help me. Yeah, it was me jogging in the park talking about my music, it's come a long way since then."
