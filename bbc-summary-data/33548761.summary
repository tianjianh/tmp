About 50 firefighters tackled the blaze on Bishop Street after they were alerted by a fire alarm around 01:30 BST on Thursday.
It is understood 100 gas canisters were inside the building at the time and exploded.
The cause of the fire is still unknown and an investigation is under way. No-one was injured.
The fire has been brought under control and roads have reopened.
The fire service said officers had stopped the blaze spreading to premises on either side of the building.
Group commander Mark Deeney said: "The building is destroyed.
"The fire is under control but we are keeping an eye out for hotspots. It's as good as out.
"We have been here for a long time because access to the building is restricted.
"All four storeys were involved in the fire and there is a risk that walls might collapse.
"It is dangerous for firefighters but we have assessed all risks."
Maria Brown, a member of staff at Poundstretcher for 16 years, said she was "completely shocked".
"I got a phone call from the manager this morning and I couldn't believe it," Ms Brown told BBC Radio Foyle.
"I went to the scene and there was smoke everywhere. It's so sad."
Michael McMenamin, who also worked at the store for almost five years, said he is worried about not having a job.
"It was such a shock to the system to see all the smoke," said Mr McMenamin.
"We are so lucky no one was injured.
"I am worried about my job now because I just moved out and I might have to move back to my mother's now.
"I loved my job. We were like a family there."
John Hamill, Poundstretcher store manager in Derry, said: "I was so concerned when I arrived and saw the smoke.
"There is structural and fire damage to the building.
"We have a 4,000 sq ft extension at the back of the building, That will need to be pulled to the ground.
"The company has invested a lot in the city over the past 25 years and we will look to restructure this store and rebuild the extension.
"There have been tears this morning but we will look at possibly relocating the business elsewhere."
