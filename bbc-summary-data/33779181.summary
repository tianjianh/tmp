A man has been hit by a bus on The Kingsway in Swansea city centre.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Emergency services were called at 16:00 BST on Tuesday. The 35-year-old suffered non life-threatening injuries.
The road was closed, but reopened Tuesday night. Swansea council and bus operator First Cymru said they were working with police to establish the crash cause.
A man was struck by a bus on the road in June and two others have died in similar incidents.
South Wales Police said the victim in Tuesday's crash was taken to the city's Morriston Hospital.
In April, a coroner investigating the death of Daniel Foss, 37, after he was hit by a National Express bus, called for action to deal with "serious design issues" on the road.
Swansea council later installed barriers along the carriageway following the death of Sgt Louise Lucas in March, in a bid to prevent pedestrians crossing.
