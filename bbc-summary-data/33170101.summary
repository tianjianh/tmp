[SN]TITLE[SN]
Labour deputy leadership shortlist finalised

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Five MPs have secured enough support from colleagues to stand for Labour's deputy leadership.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Tom Watson, Caroline Flint,  Ben Bradshaw, Stella Creasy and Angela Eagle will compete to replace Harriet Harman.
The field was widened when another candidate, Rushanara Ali, withdrew late on so her backers could help others over the 35 MP threshold.
The winner will be announced at a special conference on 12 September.
Mr Watson and Ms Flint had already secured enough votes to make it onto the ballot paper before Ms Ali's withdrawal.
Mr Bradshaw, who only secured enough nominations to stand after she pulled out, said the Bethnal Green and Bow MP's actions had been "incredibly selfless".
Labour's deputy leadership contest is running at the same time as the election to replace Ed Miliband as leader.
The contenders for this job, Andy Burnham, Yvette Cooper, Liz Kendall and Jeremy Corbyn, will go head-to-head in a live Newsnight debate from Nuneaton at 19:00 which will be shown on BBC2 and online on the Politics Live page.
