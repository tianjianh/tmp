Leigh Halfpenny: Cardiff Blues offer former full-back deal to return to Wales

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Cardiff Blues have offered full-back Leigh Halfpenny a deal to bring him back to Wales, the Welsh region's chief executive Richard Holland says.

The 27-year-old left the Blues to play for French Top 14 side Toulon in 2014 and is out of contract in the summer.
Halfpenny said he was "weighing up his options" after Toulon beat Scarlets in the European Champions Cup on Sunday.
"We've been in conversation with Leigh's representatives for some time now," Holland told BBC Radio Wales.
"In conjunction with the Welsh Rugby Union (WRU), we're very hopeful that we can put a package on the table by way of a national dual contract to bring him back to Cardiff Blues.
"We're working very closely with [WRU chief executive] Martyn Phillips and his team and let's hope we can do that for the good of Welsh rugby and Cardiff Blues."
Halfpenny, who has been capped 66 times by Wales, played for Blues for six years before his move to France.
"I'd like to think it's going to happen but how likely it is is a question to ask Leigh and his people," added Holland.
"I don't think we or the WRU can do any more. The ball is firmly in Leigh's court."
Halfpenny's current contract gives him full release to play for Wales but if he stays in France, under the terms of the WRU's senior player selection policy, he would have to rely on being named as one of three 'wildcard' picks to play for his country.
