Oshilaja, 24, made 23 appearances for the Dons on loan with the then-League Two club in the 2014-15 season.
He had not played for Cardiff since August 2014, having spent the past two seasons on loan at Gillingham.
"I know that our fans really took to Deji a couple of seasons ago," manager Neal Ardley told the club website.
"I believe he could be a top centre-back and that he could also fill in for us at full-back when needed."
