Motherwell 1-3 Heart of Midlothian

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Hearts won at Motherwell for the first time since 2010 to move up to second in the Scottish Premiership.

Stephen McManus diverted Sam Nicholson's shot into the bottom corner for the opener.
Callum Paterson thumped in a left-foot shot from distance to make it two.
And after Tony Watt had hit a post, Arnaud Djoum scored the third with a 20-yard shot, before James McFadden's stunning free-kick gave Motherwell a late consolation.
Hearts had sold 2,000 tickets for the fixture, but their supporters - and indeed the team - were plagued by traffic chaos on most of the main roads leading to Motherwell - including the M8.
There were rich pickings for the winners, a slot behind Celtic in second place in the Premiership. Both managers set up with attacking formations, yet there was a curious absence of real chances.
Watt delayed with his shot and the opening was gone. Ryan Bowman troubled Jack Hamilton in the Hearts goal, but it was a cross that ended up as a shot.
Craig Clay had a deflected effort and that brought a fabulous one handed save from Scotland goalkeeper Jack Hamilton.
Almost right on the half-time whistle Sam Nicholson shot from just outside the box that Samson in the Motherwell goal surely had covered.
However, a wicked double deflection off both Keith Lasley and McManus wrong-footed him and the ball rolled into the goal at his right post.
Goals change games, but that one would not deflect the observation that Hearts needed a half-time rethink because it was clear the partnership of Conor Sammon and Watt was not a marriage made in heaven.
Motherwell thought they had equalised early in the second half when Scott McDonald rattled the bar only for Louis Moult to force the rebound over the line, but it was chalked off by a correct offside decision against McDonald.
Hearts were actually wobbling at this stage until Scotland defender Paterson scored a fabulous goal from around 25 yards; left-footed and with enough power to test the holding power of the net to its very limit.
This time there was no hard luck story for Motherwell to embrace.
Now, for Robbie Neilson's team, it was simply a task of managing the dying moments of the game. But they did so much more.
Djoum threatened to eclipse even Paterson's effort with another glorious finish which flew beyond Samson.
But there was a final moment of magic.
McFadden scored a trademark free-kick from 30 yards which gave Hamilton no chance. It made little difference to the outcome - but what a joy to watch.
In the end it was a hugely convincing win for Hearts which for a long time most of us couldn't see coming. But luck and class - it is a hard combination to beat.
Motherwell's Mark McGhee: "I thought the first goal we conceded was ridiculous. We should be clearing our lines and getting in at 0-0.
"First 20 minutes of the second half I thought we were fantastic. We did everything but score, but the second goal kills it.
"I thought we deserved something out of the game.
"We come out of this with a lot of positives. We'll be a stronger squad after the international break with players coming back."
Hearts' Robbie Neilson: "I'm delighted with the three points, it's the first time we've won down here since 2010.
"It was two teams tonight that if they won they went second in the league, so it shows the level we're at, but it shows the level Motherwell are at.
"The first goal is a stroke of luck really, we have Jack Hamilton to thank for keeping us in the game at 0-0. But the first goal took the pressure off the players because the previous games it's been difficult to find the back of the net."
(On goalkeeper Jack Hamilton) "He makes a great save but it's also the little things. He organises the back four, he kicks well, he comes for crosses, he's aggressive, he's vocal and the players love him."
