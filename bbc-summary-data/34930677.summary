A fresh ballot for strikes will be held among drivers on Arriva Trains Wales in a long-running row over pay, terms and conditions.

The union Aslef said it had been left with no option than to re-ballot its members after accusing the company of "reneging" on a proposed deal.
A planned strike earlier this month was suspended to allow talks to be held.
Aslef's Mick Whelan said they "moved the goalposts" but Arriva's Gareth Thomas blamed a "misunderstanding".
Mr Whelan said: "After arriving at a deal with Arriva Trains Wales that we were happy to put to our members, the operator has subsequently moved the goal posts by changing the length of the shifts our members are expected to work.
"We had hoped to avoid this action, because we always work hard to find a resolution to problems without strike action, but this is no way to conduct industrial relations in the 21st century and the actions of management have left us with no choice other than to re-ballot our members."
Mr Thomas added: "The locally-elected company council were in full agreement with the terms of the deal. There appears to have been a misunderstanding between the locally-elected representatives with whom the detail of the deal was agreed and Aslef's national executive.
"Once again, we find ourselves in a position that the parts of the union closest to our people were in agreement with the detail of the deal but the national executive of Aslef, who were not involved in any discussions until November 11, seem to be unclear about the details of the deal which we believed to be acceptable to drivers locally."
