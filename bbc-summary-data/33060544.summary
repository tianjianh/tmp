[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An academy sponsored by London mayor Boris Johnson has been told it needs to improve by Ofsted following its first inspection.

Kingsley Academy in Hounslow was taken out of local authority control in 2013.
Inspectors found weaknesses in leadership and teaching and rated it as "requiring improvement". The school said the verdict was "disappointing".
A spokesman for the mayor said Mr Johnson has "not been involved in the governance" of it since 2013.
Under its former guise of Hounslow Manor Community School, it was rated "good" at its last inspection in 2011.
In the 2015 review, Ofsted inspectors found leadership and management, quality of teaching, achievement of pupils and sixth form provision all required improvement at the secondary school, which includes a sixth form.
It said: "School leaders and governors do not have a strategic school improvement plan.
"Recent initiatives have been reactive and, as a consequence, there has been limited impact on some students' progress."
The report added that "groups of students, including disadvantaged and white British students, make far less progress in English and mathematics than other students at the school."
Principal Anjali Sakhardande, aid: "There are a great deal of positive points noted in the report, however it is disappointing that the Ofsted inspectors' judgments reveal that significantly more needs to be done to fulfil our ambitions of taking our academy forward to 'good' as the next step to 'outstanding'."
City Hall has committed Â£330,000 to the school until 2017 through the London Academies Enterprise Trust which also runs the three other mayor-backed academies in Enfield and Bexley.
A spokesman for the mayor said: "The Mayor has not been involved in the governance of the schools since 2013, but we are in touch with the London Academies Education Trust to see what is being done to raise attainment at Kingsley."
In a school where a large proportion of pupils do not consider English their first language the report noted that "support for those new to the school, in particular those learning English, is very effective" and "as a result, these students make better progress than this group nationally".
Inspectors concluded that behaviour was good and pupils were courteous and respectful.
Mr Johnson has previously said his involvement in academies would raise skills and ensure better access to job.
When first elected he pledged to create 10 mayoral academies, but progress stalled on four, and the target has now been abandoned.
