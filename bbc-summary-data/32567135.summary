Emily Gardner, 14, from the Gloucester area, was out on the water with two friends, both girls aged 15, and a 50-year-old man when the boat capsized.
The teenager became trapped underneath the 16ft speedboat when it overturned off Brixham on Saturday morning.
The group were on holiday in Devon at the time of the accident, and Emily was with a friend's family.
Her family paid tribute to her: "Our beautiful Emily was a caring loving, gentle daughter and sister. She was full of life and had the world ahead of her. She was our diamond, now shining bright in the sky.
"She will be missed and forever in our hearts."
Emergency services were called at 11:44 BST where they released the teenager before taking her to shore.
Mark Criddle, coxswain of Torbay's RNLI lifeboat, said the speedboat was upside down with a girl trapped inside.
"We located the girl and brought her onboard the lifeboat where she was immediately given first aid by a doctor and paramedic who were members of the lifeboat crew," he said.
She was taken to Torbay Hospital where she was pronounced dead a short time after.
The man and two girls, also from the Gloucester area, were taken to shore by two men on sea scooters before the lifeboat crew arrived.
They suffered minor injuries and have since been discharged from hospital.
The men, aged 18 and 50 and from the Worcester area, were also taken to hospital but later discharged.
Specialist divers were able to remove the capsized boat from the water to help with the investigation.
Det Sgt Andy Turner, deputy senior investigating officer, based in Torquay, said: "Our thoughts are with the family and friends who are affected by this tragic incident.
"I would like to thank the public and the emergency services for their assistance in getting the casualties to hospital swiftly."
