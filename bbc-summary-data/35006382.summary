[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Kevin Johnstone, 41, of Llanelli, Carmarthenshire, was working at a building site when he slipped amphetamine into Tony Jones's drink.
Swansea Crown Court heard Mr Jones was taken to hospital complaining of heart pain after the stunt.
Johnstone previously pleaded guilty to unlawfully and maliciously causing amphetamines to be administered.
The court heard Johnstone thought it would be a "good joke" to watch his colleague react to the drugs.
Johnstone's defence barrister James Jenkins said Mr Jones's condition "was not life threatening at anytime" and the incident was a "joke that went wrong".
Sentencing Johnstone to 10 months in prison, suspended for two years, Recorder Elwen Evans QC, said he had shown "exceptionally stupid behaviour".
"This is the deliberate spiking of someone's hot drink at work," she said.
"Spiking their drink for some sort of entertainment.
"You thought it was a joke."
