Smith, 25, won a silver in the pommel horse event in 2012 and was part of the group that collected a team bronze.
He won pommel horse gold at the recent British Championships and is in a six-man squad for the event in Montpellier.
Four-time Commonwealth Games gold medallist Claudia Fragapane, 17, is one of four gymnasts in the women's squad.
She is joined by European and Commonwealth bars champion Becky Downie, her younger sister Ellie and 2015 British all-around champion Amy Tinkler, who makes her senior international debut.
The event begins on 15 April and World Championships all-around silver medallist Max Whitlock is also in the men's squad, as are Sam Oldham, Kristian Thomas, Daniel Purvis and Courtney Tulloch.
After the Olympics, Smith took a break from the sport and spent some time working in television programmes, winning the Strictly Come Dancing title in December 2012.
But he returned to gymnastics in 2014 and won a pommel horse bronze and a team gold while representing England in the Commonwealth Games in Glasgow.
