S4C is a special case for public funding, says Tory MP

It is "more important" for the Welsh language television station S4C to remain on air than "any other BBC channel", a Conservative MP has said.

S4C gets most of its income from the licence fee and UK ministers have announced a major review of the BBC.
Monmouth MP David Davies told BBC Wales S4C was a "special case as it promotes the Welsh language".
Ministers have said S4C should aim for similar cost savings as the BBC.
On Thursday, Labour warned that cuts to the BBC's budget threatened S4C, but Culture Secretary John Whittingdale told MPs there was a commitment to the channel "within the next couple of years", and he hoped to have discussions with its management in the near future.
Mr Davies told BBC Radio Cymru's Rhaglen Dylan Jones, on Friday: "The government realise the importance of S4C and that it's more than a station, it's important to the future of the Welsh language."
Mr Davies also hinted that the Welsh Affairs Committee, which he chairs, could consider conducting an inquiry into broadcasting, including S4C.
"These are personal views but I believe S4C to be a special case as it promotes the Welsh language and I believe it to be more important that S4C caries on more than any other BBC channel," he added.
S4C has said it has experienced "substantial cuts" since  2010 and would emphasise the "uniqueness" of its service, and its "value and importance, both culturally and economically", in talks with ministers.
A green paper on the future of the BBC released on Thursday noted that "audience reach has been falling across some indigenous language services over the last few years, particularly in Wales".
It added the higher hourly cost of Welsh-language radio programming compared to English-language output "raises concerns about value for money".
