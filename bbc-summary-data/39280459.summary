[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Plans to restore Newport's oldest surviving shopping arcade have moved a step forward.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The council has been granted Â£177,300 from the Heritage Lottery Fund (HLF) to help prepare plans to revamp the Grade II-listed Market Arcade on High Street.
Almost half of the shops are vacant and it has suffered from anti-social behaviour and pest issues.
The council said the funding would help prevent the "spiral of decline" that threatens the "historic asset".
The funding will pay for the development of a project plan as well as a full-time manager to oversee it.
The council said the arcade, opened in 1905, had historical significance which was intertwined with the growth of Newport as a town following the Industrial Revolution.
In the past year, the local authority has looked at ways of improving it and a campaign was launched.
The  funding award also means that, subject to a successful second application, a further Â£1.1m HLF cash will be set aside for the project.
The council, shop owners and Welsh Government's heritage body Cadw would then need to match the funding.
