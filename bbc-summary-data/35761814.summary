The man, 45, and woman, 46, both suffered serious leg injuries after the gun attack on Addenbrooke Drive in Speke at around 21:20 GMT on Tuesday.
They are being treated in hospital but their injuries are not thought to be life-threatening.
The offenders are believed to have forced entry to the house before shooting the pair with a shotgun, police said.
Merseyside Police believe it was a targeted incident and are seeking witnesses and CCTV from the area.
Det Insp Rachel Wilson from the Matrix Serious Organised Crime unit said it was "a brazen attack" and said the force will "act on all information" brought forward.
"We will not tolerate the use of guns on the streets of Speke or anywhere in Merseyside", she said.
