Kilmarnock: Souleymane Coulibaly eyes Italy or Ivory Coast cap choice

Souleymane Coulibaly, once dubbed "the new Didier Drogba", hopes scoring for Kilmarnock will mean he has to make the choice between Ivory Coast or Italy.

The 21-year-old has signed for the Scottish Premiership club after being released by Peterborough United.
He has played for Ivory Coast Under-20s but has dual nationality and can still choose at senior international level.
"I am waiting for my chance, whether it is from the first team in Africa or Italy," he told BBC Scotland.
"The best thing is to work hard and score a lot of goals."
Born in Anguededou Songon, Coulibaly moved to Italy aged 13 to join his father, who had married an Italian.
But it was while representing his homeland that he was compared to compatriot and former Chelsea striker Drogba.
"They started calling me the new Drogba after the Under-17 World Cup," he said.
"But he is a legend and it would just be nice just to meet him."
Coulibaly was on the books of Seina before moving to Tottenham Hotspur as a teenager.
After a loan spell with Grosseto, he switched permanently to Bari and had another loan term with Pistoiese before signing for Peterborough last summer.
He scored five goals in 32 appearances for the League One Posh but ended the season in the division below, finding the net once in six games while on loan with Newport County.
Coulibaly was one of 11 signings announced in one day as manager Lee Clark rebuilds his Kilmarnock squad.
"It is a good challenge for me and a good adventure," he said.
Fellow new recruit Callum McFadzean has already switched allegiances, having played for Scotland Under-21s after having represented England at under-16 level.
Now the 22-year-old Waterthorpe-born midfielder is looking forward to playing north of the border for the first time after leaving Sheffield United.
"When David Weir was at Sheffield United, he asked if I had any Scottish relations and I said my grandad - and he thought I would be a great asset to Scotland and it just materialised from there," McFadzean explained.
Having come through the Blades' youth ranks, he only managed 23 appearances for the League One club and had loan spells with Chesterfield, Burton Albion then, last season, Stevenage in League Two.
"I had some disappointing seasons, missing out on promotion and it just didn't work out," he said. "I had my chances and then a new manager would come in and I had to start again."
McFadzean says that his ability to play several positions should help him win regular football at Rugby Park.
"Just a hard-working player who likes to get forward but also tracks back," he said when asked to describe himself. "A team player, but I obviously want to do well for myself as well.
"I think I am a versatile player, so you will see me in several positions over the season.
"I have played at the top of the diamond, left and right, at left-back and I've played at right-back as well."
