[SN]TITLE[SN]
Guernsey Police breached data protection laws

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Guernsey Police have been ordered to review how data is kept after a complaint to the Bailiwick Data Protection Commissioner was upheld.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Paul Moed, who is involved in an ongoing custody case, questioned what details about him were held in the minutes of a multi-agency meeting.
Commissioner Emma Martins investigated and found there was some inaccurate and out of date information on file.
She gave the force until 21 June to carry out the review.
Mr Moed claimed the incorrect information held on him had been damaging to his case and said he did not believe he was the only person to have been affected.
A force spokesman confirmed certain data had been recorded inaccurately as a result of what he called a "misunderstanding when writing the minutes" of the Multi Agency Risk Assessment Committee meeting.
He said the process was already being reviewed and measures were being adopted to help ensure a similar occurrence would not happen in the future.
