Newent murder inquiry: IPCC to probe previous police contact

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Gloucestershire Constabulary has referred itself to the police watchdog, the IPCC, following the death of a 43-year-old man.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The man's body was found at a property on Meek Road, Newent on Wednesday.
A 51-year-old local woman was arrested on Thursday on suspicion of murder. Earlier on Friday officers were given an extra 36 hours to question her.
A force spokesman said as a result of previous police contact the matter had been voluntarily referred to the IPCC.
He said the Independent Police Complaints Commission "would review police action prior to the victim's death".
"At this stage it would be inappropriate to comment further," Gloucestershire Constabulary said.
