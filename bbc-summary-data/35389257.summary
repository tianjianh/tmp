League Two side Oxford had seen off Premier League outfit Swansea in the previous round, but conceded twice in the first half against the visitors.
Rovers took the lead through Ben Marshall's confident penalty after Simeon Jackson was brought down.
Debutant Tony Watt drilled in the second from inside the area, before Marshall curled in a free-kick.
Striker Jordan Rhodes was not selected as he is on the verge of a reported Â£9m move to Middlesbrough, but his replacement Watt made a decent start to his Rovers career by netting.
The closest Oxford came to scoring was when Liam Sercombe's angled drive was tipped around the post by goalkeeper Jason Steele.
Kemar Roofe, who scored twice against Swansea, dragged a shot wide as their FA Cup run came to an end.
Blackburn manager Paul Lambert: "Jordan Rhodes came and saw me, he wanted to go, and to be honest I thought the club should have taken the offer the summer before.
"He has been excellent for Blackburn, but the money is too good to turn down. The investment will help, the club has got to rebuild.
"I thought we were excellent. Oxford are a good side - they beat Swansea in the last round and they are doing well in their league.
Oxford manager Michael Appleton: "We knew it wouldn't be easy and we came across a really strong outfit in Blackburn.
"We weren't surprised by them - we knew what they are about. We played a part in all their goals, which is disappointing. We were a little bit naive and it probably shows why we are still a League Two side but we will learn from it.
"We are having a fantastic time this year, but we are where we are for a reason. We just came up a bit short today."
