The child was a passenger aboard a hatchback car that was involved in a collision with the actress's Mercedes on Thursday night in Rajasthan state.
The MP from Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party, was taken to hospital with minor injuries.
The driver of Ms Malini's car has been arrested, police said.
"Hema has injuries above her eyes, on her back and legs. I drove her to the hospital in my car. She was in pain," state lawmaker Shankar Lal Sharma told reporters.
"One girl child has died in the accident," he added.
Other passengers in the hatchback and its driver were injured and taken to hospital, the Press Trust of India quoted a local official as saying.

The actress has starred in nearly 150 films, including hits such as Sholay, Seeta aur Geeta and Johnny Mera Naam.

News of the accident has been trending on social media in India with many writing in to express their concern for the actress.
