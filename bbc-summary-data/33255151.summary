Crofters 'face livestock crisis' over lack of grazing

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Crofters in the Highlands and Islands are facing a crisis due to lack of grazing for their livestock, according to the Scottish Crofting Federation (SCF).

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The organisation said severe weather and low temperatures had affected grass growth.
This meant that cows have been unable to graze and are losing weight as a result.
It is feared the situation may also affect the animals breeding.
The SCF said that weather conditions had affected crofters' income due to a fall in tourism, with many being unable to afford extra supplies of hay, feed and straw.
The organisation has written to Rural Affairs Secretary Richard Lochhead to explain the situation and ask for emergency payments to be made.
SCF director Joyce Wilkinson said: "Everywhere I go I see and hear of near-crisis conditions.
"We brought it up with government officials and were told that the CAP 'rebate' was to be paid this week and that could be considered an emergency payment to help with the crisis.
"But the rebate is based on a percentage of the producer's claim, excluding the first Â£2,000 - which of course means some small producers will receive very low payments, if any.
"SCF are convinced that a real emergency payment needs to be made as soon as possible to avoid catastrophe for many small producers, who are the source of calves for the Scottish beef system, which in turn will face problems if something is not done now."
A spokesman for the Scottish government said: "We understand the recent weather has been particularly challenging for crofters and farmers and we will continue to look at what we can do to assist famers and crofters at this time.
"Support is already available for farmers and crofters through Pillar 1 and Pillar 2 of the CAP and Â£12m in top-up payments distributed at the beginning of June should provide some interim help.
"In the future the new island rates for Beef Voluntary Coupled Support will also help farmers and crofters deal with the impact of external events, such as challenges presented by weather."
