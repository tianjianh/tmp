Retailer American Apparel has been granted a restraining order against the company's founder and former boss, Dov Charney.

The Delaware court order temporarily restrains Mr Charney from breaking a previous agreement, the firm said.
It prevents him from making any negative statements in the press about the company and from trying to get board members removed.
He was ousted last year after an investigation into alleged misconduct.
It followed a series of sexual harassment claims made by former employees.
American Apparel has already sued Mr Charney in May for breaking the agreement.
"Mr. Charney is temporarily restrained from directly or indirectly seeking the removal of any member of the Company's board of directors, including by instigating, encouraging, acting in concert with or assisting any third party in seeking to do so," the company's statement said.
He is "temporarily restrained from making or causing to be made to any third party (including by press release or other statement to the press or media) any statement that disparages or negatively reflects on the Company or its current, former or future employees, officers or directors," it continued.
Mr Charney's lawyer Stephen Brauerman said that his client intended to "fully comply" with the order.
"The Court's order is preliminary and based on pleadings we have not had an opportunity... fully to challenge at this stage", he said.
Canadian-born Mr Charney founded American Apparel in 1998 with a $10,000 loan from his father.
The firm rose to prominence in the mid-2000s for its "hipster chic" clothing, which is all made in America.
