The 23-year-old, who came through Rovers' youth system, played 35 times in all competitions last season.
"Being a Bristol lad I know what it means to the club and fans to be back in League One. It's brilliant to re-sign," Clarke told the club website.
Meanwhile, Rovers' Chris Lines is set to stay with the club after agreeing a new contract, reports BBC Points West.
Fellow midfielder Lines, 30, played 36 first-team matches last term as Rovers won promotion to League One.
He began his career with the club, making 156 league starts between 2004 and 2011 before moving to Sheffield Wednesday and later Port Vale.
Bristol-born Lines rejoined Darrell Clarke's side, initially on a short-term loan deal, in March 2015.
