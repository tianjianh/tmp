[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Ross Workman, former head of Oldswinford C of E Primary School in Stourbridge, appeared at Dudley Magistrates' Court.
The 50-year-old, of Low Fold Close, Worcester, was charge with six counts of making indecent images of a child between January and March 2011.
He was bailed to be sentenced at Wolverhampton Crown Court on 2 March.
Workman was arrested in November 2014 and parents were informed about the investigation by letter.
Jenny Birchall, head teacher at Oldswinford CE Primary School, said: "We are aware of the court case involving a former employee, who resigned over a year ago.
"I would stress that there is no suggestion that the school, its staff, or the pupils of our school are involved in any way."
Councillor Ian Cooper, cabinet member for children's services at Dudley Council, said: "Mr Workman resigned from his post in January last year and therefore is no longer employed by the local authority."
An NSPCC spokesman said: "As a headteacher Ross Workman was trusted by children and parents.
"His crimes have only helped fuel this disgusting crime which destroys children's lives."
