The life of a Tyneside artist is being honoured with the unveiling of a commemorative plaque at his former home.

John Falconar Slater was best known for his paintings of land and seascapes in the north-east of England.
Painting with a distinct impressionist style, one of his most celebrated works was Stormy Sea at Cullercoats.
Mr Slater was also part of the Cullercoats Colony - a group of professional artists from the North East who captured the character of the fishing community and the surrounding coastline throughout their work.
Born in 1897 in Rye Hill, Newcastle, in his later life Mr Slater lived in Whitley Bay before moving to Cullercoats 12 years before he died in 1937.
Now, on the 75th anniversary of his death, the current owners of the artist's final home are commemorating his life with a Blue Plaque.
Steve and Alwyne Barrigan approached North Tyneside Council earlier this year to request the blue plaque at their house on St Oswin's Avenue.
Blue plaques commemorate the links between notable figures of the past and the buildings in which they lived and worked.
Mr Barrigan said: "We have lived here for many years and when we discovered that John Falconar Slater had lived here we were inspired to mark his legacy in some way.
"This is a great achievement for us, Cullercoats and the North East."
Elected Mayor Linda Arkley was due to officially unveil the £300 plaque on Wednesday.
She said: "It is fantastic that we have been able to honour such a great artist and also fulfil a longstanding wish of Alwyne and Steve.
"The commemorative plaques are just one of the ways in which we are able to celebrate the borough's talent and heritage."
