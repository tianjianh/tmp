Kent Fire and Rescue said crews were sent to the Eton Road entrance of the derelict amusement arcade, which is currently being renovated.
The fire was in the roof space of the two storey building, but had already been extinguished before they arrived.
The cause of the fire was accidental, the fire service said. Dreamland is due to open to the public on 19 June.
A spokeswoman for Dreamland said the "small fire" on Dreamland's buffet building's roof happened during maintenance works, and stemmed from "hot works igniting old timbers in the structure".
"The fire was put out before the emergency services arrived, health and safety was adhered to at all times and nobody was hurt," she said.
