Lawro's opponents for this weekend Premier League fixtures is comedian and Brentford fan Nathan Caton.

Caton told BBC Sport: "The mighty Bees are my local club in west London and they are my team.
"The best moment I have had supporting them was either getting promoted to the Championship in 2014, or beating our neighbours Fulham 4-1 at Craven Cottage last season.
"I went to that game and it was brilliant to see all our goals go in."
A correct result (picking a win, draw or defeat) is worth 10 points. The exact score earns 40 points.
Last weekend, Lawro got three correct results and no perfect scores from seven Premier League matches, to give him a total of 30 points.
He drew with world heavyweight champion boxer Anthony Joshua, who also got three results correct, with no perfect scores.
Lawro also picked up 40 points for correctly predicting Arsenal's 3-0 win over West Brom on 21 April. Another world champion boxer, super-bantamweight Carl Frampton, also added 10 points to his score for choosing the right result.

Match report
Lawro's prediction: 2-0
Caton's prediction: Palace will be on a high after winning their semi-final but they might be saving themselves for the final, while Newcastle are scrapping. 1-0
Match report
Lawro's prediction: 1-1
Caton's prediction: I have a sneaky feeling Sunderland will get something. 1-1
Match report
Lawro's prediction: 2-0
Caton's prediction: Villa could play a bit better now that relegation has taken the weight off their shoulders, but I'm backing Watford. 2-0
Match report
Lawro's prediction: 2-1
Caton's prediction: West Ham are still going for a European spot and I think they will have too much for the Baggies. 1-3

Caton's prediction: 3-0
Match report
Lawro's prediction: 1-1
Caton's prediction: This was the Brendan Rodgers derby - I guess it is the Joe Allen derby now. 1-2
Match report
Lawro's prediction: 1-1
Caton's prediction: Oh, this is a massive game. If United play like they did in the first half of their FA Cup semi-final against Everton then I can't see them losing. With Leicester striker Jamie Vardy still suspended I am going for United to shade it. 2-1
Match report
Lawro's prediction: 0-2
Caton's prediction: Both teams are on form, but City might want it a bit more to cement a top-four place. 2-3
Match report
If Leicester draw at Old Trafford on Sunday and Tottenham drop points too then the title race is all over.
It is clear that Chelsea's fans would love Spurs to miss out - and so would the some of the Blues' players. In fact, Eden Hazard spoke out about it this week.
I think they might get their wish.
Lawro's prediction: 1-1
Caton's prediction: Chelsea will not let Tottenham beat them, I know that for a fact. So as good as Spurs are playing, Chelsea will be playing their hearts out to let Leicester win the league. 2-2
