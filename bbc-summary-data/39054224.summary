A camel hair coat and trilby worn by actor George Cole in popular comedy-drama Minder fetched 11,500 'nicker' at auction.

The props, which had been left in a wardrobe at his family home, were synonymous with Cole's character, wheeler-dealer Arthur Daley.
Cole, who died in Reading in 2015, played the salesman on the ITV series between 1979 and 1994.
The coat and hat were sold on Thursday by Special Auction Services in Newbury.
The auction house said it was delighted with the final price, which was around 10 times higher than the £800 - £1,200 estimate.
It said the hammer price was £10,000, which increases to £11,500 with the buyer's premium.
Cole's widow, Penelope, said the items had been left in a wardrobe at their house near Henley-on-Thames for "some years".
"There are people of a certain age who grew up watching Minder with their parents and to whom these items will mean a great deal," she said.
