She was third in the 1,000m in Minsk - 0.233 seconds behind winner, China's Han Yutong (1min 31.008 secs), with Dutch skater Rianne de Vries second.
Gilmartin also won bronze a week earlier, in the 1500m in Dresden.
Team-mate Elise Christie missed Minsk after suffering concussion but expects to be at next month's world championships in Rotterdam.
