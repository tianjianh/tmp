[SN]TITLE[SN]
Poppi Worthington's father to give inquest evidence

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The father of a 13-month-old girl who died in unexplained circumstances will be called to give evidence at her inquest, a coroner has decided.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Poppi Worthington from Barrow died in hospital in December 2012.
A High Court family judge concluded her father Paul Worthington sexually abused her, but no charges were brought and Mr Worthington has denied any wrongdoing.
Cumbria coroner David Roberts said he wants Mr Worthington at the inquest later this year.
Papers for a pre-inquest review planned for Friday reveal Mr Worthington is one of several "interested persons" the coroner wants to speak to.
The inquest will also hear from several medical experts, police and consider the findings of the High Court family judge which were made public in January.
The judge, Mr Justice Peter Jackson, sitting at Liverpool Crown Court, ruled that - on the balance of probabilities - Mr Worthington "perpetrated a penetrative ... assault on Poppi".
The Crown Prosecution Service has previously said there was insufficient evidence to charge Mr Worthington.
The inquest, scheduled to last 10 days in October, will be the second into Poppi's death with a previous hearing in October, 2014, taking seven minutes to return a verdict of unexplained death.
