[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
English Heritage gave permission for work to be done on the 16th Century Charminster bridge, near Dorchester, after serious flooding in January 2014.
Damage estimated to be about £50,000 was caused to St Mary the Virgin church and nearby homes.
The bridge's original stones were used to enlarge its arches to improve the flow of the River Cerne beneath.
Access through the village has been off limits for five months because of the work, which cost about £260,000.
Dorset County Council has worked with the Environment Agency and English Heritage on the project.
Jill Haynes, councillor for three valleys, said: "I am very impressed with the work that's been done. The bridge looks great, using stone from the original structure."
Additional flood prevention works are due to be carried out over the next few months, the Environment Agency said.
Records show the 16th Century stone bridge was rebuilt in the early 19th Century and at least one side of it was rebuilt in 1933.
