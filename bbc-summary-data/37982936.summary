[SN]TITLE[SN]
Grimsby Town 2-2 Carlisle United

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A late equaliser from Tom Bolarinwa helped Grimsby maintain their unbeaten start under new boss Marcus Bignot.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 26-year-old scored at the second attempt as the Mariners drew with Carlisle at Blundell Park.
A costly error from James McKeown gift-wrapped an opener to Charlie Wyke, before Omar Bogle levelled from the penalty spot.
Zak Mills then turned into his own net as Carlisle regained the lead, courtesy of a devilish ball from the right-hand side.
But as has proved to be a trait since the arrival of Bignot - from Solihull Moors - the Mariners never gave up.
And they had Bolarinwa to thank for earning a share of the spoils. He won an initial header, before firing home from close range.
Earlier in the evening, an acrobatic overhead kick from Bogle went inches wide of the Carlisle target.
At the other end a similar attempt from Nicky Adams had Grimsby keeper McKeown scrambling across his line.
