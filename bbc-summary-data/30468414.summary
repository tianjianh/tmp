Khan, 28, is targeting a bout against Floyd Mayweather or Manny Pacquiao after retaining his WBC Silver welterweight title in Las Vegas.
And the Bolton-born fighter is confident he could beat either man.
"I feel better at 28 than I did at 26," he said. "I'm hitting my peak and getting better as a fighter. I can't wait to show the world what I have."
Speaking to BBC Radio 5 live's Sportsweek programme, he added: "This victory puts me in a great position now to fight the biggest names of boxing - the likes of Mayweather and Pacquiao. That's where I belong."
Khan may have to wait until after 2 May to fight either opponent as American five-weight world champion Mayweather has mentioned that date for a fight against Filipino Pacquiao, who has won world titles in eight weight divisions.
That could become the richest bout in boxing history and Khan believes that contest would suit Mayweather more than a fight against him.
"Stylistically, I think that Mayweather does not want me because I have that style which causes him big problems," he said.
"But it's up to Mayweather now. The ball is in his court. I'll leave it to my team and him to get that fight done.
"It's a fight that the British crowd and boxing fans want so why don't we get it done now?"
Fellow Briton Kell Brook has been highlighted as a possible opponent but Khan played down such a fight.
"If Mayweather doesn't want it then I think Manny Pacquiao is a great name. We trained together and there is a great storyline there," he said.
"The Kell Brook fight will always be there. At the moment, I want to catch the right guys - the likes of Mayweather and Pacquiao.
"How long are they going to be in the sport for and at the top of their game?"
