He kicked 19 points as the All Blacks beat Australia 34-17 to become the first side to retain the trophy.
Carter, who is ending his international career to join French side Racing 92, missed the 2011 win through injury.

"It has been an amazing career and to finish like this is hard to believe," said the 33-year-old.
"This victory means a lot - it was a dark place four years ago and I've had to work extremely hard to be here today."

Carter is the all-time leading points scorer in Test rugby, finishing with 1,598 after starring in Saturday's win at Twickenham.
He has twice been voted world player of the year and is shortlisted for the prize again this year.
"This win is right up there with everything I've done in my career - it is the ultimate achievement," he said.
"I'm proud of the boys and what they have achieved. Becoming the first team to retain the trophy shows how special this side is."
Captain Richie McCaw and fly-half Carter cemented their places as the two best players in All Blacks history with the win, according to coach Steve Hansen.
"Richie is the best All Black we have ever had and Dan is a close second," he said.
"The only thing that separates them is Richie has played 149 matches at flanker, which is unheard of - you put your body on the line every time you go there.
"The challenge for the other guys now is to to try and become as great as him and Dan."
McCaw seemed to indicate that he is not thinking about retiring after leading his nation to their third Rugby World Cup victory.
"I still don't want it to end," said the 34-year-old flanker, who also skippered the All Blacks to their 2011 triumph.
"I'm still part of this team, I'm going to enjoy today, how can you have enough of this?
"I don't think you ever have enough of it. If you get moments like this why would you ever call it a day."
Despite the final starting at 5am (16:00 GMT) back home, thousands of New Zealand fans set their alarm clocks early to watch the final.
And, following the victory, capital city Wellington went into party mode.
Jubilant supporters poured out of pubs on the capital's Courtenay Place entertainment strip, with cars flying All Black flags, tooting their horns and strangers in All Black jerseys and scarves hugging on the pavement.
New Zealand Prime Minister John Key tweeted his congratulations, describing the All Blacks players as "absolute legends".
After the match, he also told the BBC: "My feeling is obviously one of elation now that we've got to the final whistle - and great pride.
"We have a team that has achieved something that no one else has in rugby terms, winning back-to-back World Cups."
New Zealand deserved their victory and to be crowned world champions, admitted Australia coach Michael Cheika.
Cheika, 48, has transformed the fortunes of the Wallabies since replacing Ewen McKenzie, who resigned in October last year after three straight defeats.
But he conceded that his side were not good enough to match the All Blacks.
"We fought back bravely, but they're the world champions and they deserve to be," added the former Leinster boss.
"New Zealand won fair and square and they've been the form team since the last World Cup. We wanted to challenge them tonight, and I think we did, but we just came up short."
New Zealand centre Sonny Bill Williams, who earned admiration and praise for consoling opposite number Jesse Kriel in the wake of the All Blacks' semi-final win over South Africa, showed generosity in victory once again.
The 30-year-old gave his medal to a young fan who had been tackled by a security guard after attempting to run onto the pitch to celebrate with the players.
Williams said that he felt sorry for Charlie Lines and hoped that "the medal made it a night to remember for him."
Williams was also part of the All Blacks team that won the tournament four years ago and will attempt to win gold with the New Zealand sevens team when rugby union makes its Olympic debut in Rio in 2016.
