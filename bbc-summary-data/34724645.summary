Speaking at Prime Minister's Questions, David Cameron said Operation Stack - where lorries park on the M20 during cross-Channel disruption - was a "serious problem".
He was responding to a question from Damian Collins, who is the Conservative MP for Folkestone and Hythe.
Stack was used 32 times during summer.
It followed strikes by French ferry workers, migrant activity and disruption to cross-Channel rail operations.
Mr Collins said: "The Channel Tunnel and Port of Dover are major pieces of national infrastructure, but when there are big disruptions to services it causes chaos on Kent's roads.
"As the government completes its final work on the spending review, will the Prime Minister give special consideration to the need for an urgent and long term solution to Operation Stack?"
Mr Cameron responded: "I absolutely recognise the serious problems that were caused to Kent's residents and businesses when it comes necessary to put into place Operation Stack.
"We've already introduced short-term measures to reduce the impact, including using the temporary availability of Manston airfield as a contingency measure.
"I understand the pressures and we'll do everything we can to relieve them."
In October, Kent County Council (KCC) leader Paul Carter said Mr Osborne must set aside funding in his Autumn Statement after the council estimated the disruption had cost the county's economy Â£45m.
