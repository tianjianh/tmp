The visitors carried a 2-1 lead into the second leg in Cyprus but conceded a scrappy first-half goal to Andre Schembri.
The game was intermittently held up by flares released by the home fans and water breaks because of the heat.
Aberdeen never found their rhythm and lost a late second to Emilio Zelaya.
Dons manager Derek McInnes will be frustrated that his side managed only to create half-chances, although Kenny McLean steered a header on target in time added on but also straight at Apollon goalkeeper Esteves do Vale.
Apollon spent much of the second half time-wasting but held on to secure the 3-2 win on aggregate.
After the final whistle, there were disturbances among the fans in the away end of the ground, leading to riot police becoming involved.
The two sides scoped each other out in the early stages and Aberdeen failed to take command of the game in midfield.
Apollon were confident as they sought the goal they needed to alter the dynamic of the tie.
It arrived when Jander surged past a lacklustre Greg Stewart on the left before crossing into the box. The ball reached Anton Maglica, who spun and then sent it into the six-yard box, where Schembri scuffed it towards goal, helped on its way by Gary Mackay-Steven's despairing lunge.
With the score tied at 2-2 on aggregate, Aberdeen knew that a solitary goal would still be enough to send them through.
They struggled to create chances, though, with Do Vale only having to deal with a Ryan Christie free kick, that he pushed away.
The stop-start nature of the second half didn't help the visitors, as the home fans kept letting off flares that interrupted the game - one landing in the back of Aberdeen goalkeeper Joe Lewis's net.
Swiss referee Stephan Klossner was caught on television advising an official that he would abandon the match if the home crowd did not stop.
Aberdeen began to press more urgently for the breakthrough, with McLean rounding the goalkeeper only for the Apollon defence to clear the threat.
The visitors' need for a goal cost them, though, as they were caught on the counter attack.
With four minutes left, a burst upfield had Aberdeen exposed at the back. Marios Stylianou thought he had added to the home side's lead, only for Lewis to brilliantly tip the shot on to the bar, but the ball then fell to substitute Zelaya, who lashed his volley into the net.
On a night when Aberdeen struggled to create clear chances and were let down by continually poor passing, the team ran out of time.
