He was among a team of 24 firefighters that were called to the building in Auchmead Road, Greenock, at 00:18.
The firefighter was injured after an external wall collapsed. He is being treated at Inverclyde Royal Hospital.
An investigation is under way into the incident and the cause of the fire is being treated as suspicious.
A spokesman for the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service said: "The fire had broken through the roof of the property and 24 firefighters were engaged in fighting the fire.
"During this operation one of our firefighters was injured following the collapse of an external wall. He was taken to Inverclyde Royal Hospital where he remains in a serious condition."
The spokesman said the fire service was "offering full support to the firefighter, his family and his colleagues" at what he described as a "very difficult time".
He added: "We are conducting a detailed internal investigation.
"The Scottish Fire and Rescue Service is also working with Police Scotland to determine the cause of the fire which is currently being treated as suspicious."
Police Scotland said no members of the public were hurt in the incident, and urged anyone with any information about the fire to contact them.
Justice Secretary Michael Matheson said: "Our thoughts are with the firefighter, his family and colleagues at this difficult time.
"The dedication and courage of firefighters reminds us of the debt of gratitude we all owe the brave men and women who serve in our emergency services.
"They do an extremely difficult and challenging job, often putting themselves at risk to keep the people of Scotland safe from harm. They do an outstanding job and provide a great service for our communities."
