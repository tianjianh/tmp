Warrington winger Gene Ormsby has joined Super League rivals Huddersfield Giants with immediate effect.

Ormsby had already agreed to join Giants for the 2017 season, having made two appearances during a one-month loan spell with the club in April.
The 23-year-old scored 29 tries in 42 games for Warrington, but played in only five games this season.
"I wanted to get game time, so it's good for my career to be here," he told Huddersfield's club website.
