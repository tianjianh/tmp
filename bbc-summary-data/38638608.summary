The Australia international was looking the other way when he was hit in the 18th over of the Strikers' run chase.
The bat slipped out of Brad Hodge's hands, flew into the air and the handle caught Nevill on the cheekbone.
Hospital tests revealed Nevill, 31, had a burst blood vessel in his cheek.
Marcus Harris top-scored with 85 as the Renegades scored 171, with the Strikers falling six runs short in their 20 overs at the Adelaide Oval.
It is the second time in a week Nevill has been forced from the field with a head injury, after he was hit by a fielder's throw against Sydney Sixers.
Nevill was cleared of concussion shortly after the end of the match but later confirmed he will be unavailable for the rest of the Renegades' campaign and will be monitored by Cricket New South Wales medical staff in the coming weeks.
