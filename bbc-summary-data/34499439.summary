The victims were Willie Lynch and Tara Gilbert, their daughters Kelsey and Jodie, Thomas and Sylvia Connors and their children Jim, Christy and six-month-old Mary.
Jimmy Lynch, 39, a brother of Willie, also died in the blaze.
Two adults and a child who were injured remain in hospital.
Post-mortem examinations of the remains of those who died have been carried out but it is expected to be a number of days before they are officially identified using DNA and dental records.
It is understood the fire broke out at a pre-fabricated building at the site and quickly spread to a nearby unit.
Irish Prime Minister Enda Kenny visited the site on Sunday to offer his sympathy to the families of those who died.
He said flags on government and public buildings would fly at half-mast on the days the victims' funerals take place.
Police are investigating the cause of the blaze but it is not being treated as suspicious.
Prayers were said at Masses on Sunday for the victims and their relatives and members of the public have been leaving flowers and messages of sympathy at the entrance to the site.
A minute's silence was held before the Republic of Ireland's Euro 2016 qualifying match against Poland in Warsaw as a mark of respect.
Geraldine Dunn, from the Southside Traveller Action Group support group said the victims' families were in "an enormous amount of shock".
"I don't think Ireland has slept last night thinking about the tragedy, so I really don't know how to sum it up in one word, the effect of what has happened," she said.
"I have to say all our communities have been outstanding with the amount of support that they have given.
"The whole country has come together to support in any kind of a way that they can."
The site remains sealed off while investigations continue into how the fire started.
