Vintage vehicle enthusiast crushed by 'ice-cream tram'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man was crushed to death by the vintage tram he was converting into a mobile cafe and ice-cream parlour, an inquest has heard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Engineer and vintage vehicle enthusiast George Manser, 63, was killed while restoring the tram at his workshop in Sarisbury Green, Hampshire, in May.
It was up on a jack when it topped over crushing Mr Manser against metal steps by a nearby wall.
A Portsmouth coroner recorded a verdict of accidental death.
Mr Manser had hoped to visit shows with the converted tram.
He was checking its tyres prior to the accident, ahead of the vehicle's MOT.
It was raised about 2ft (0.6m) when it started to topple and the jack gave way, the inquest heard.
Following the verdict, his brother Bill Manser said he had been "in the wrong place at the wrong time".
He described him as a "very kind and caring man" who loved trying to keep old machines alive.
He added the family hoped his death would "remind people to check their equipment and workspace, especially when working with heavy vehicles".
