NICEM apologises for 'Holy Cross' school dispute comparison

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Northern Ireland Council for Ethnic Minorities (NICEM) has apologised for comparing school merger plan with the Holy Cross sectarian dispute of 2001.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Last week, NICEM boss Patrick Yu warned of racist attacks on ethnic minority pupils from Fane Street Primary if it merged with other schools in the area.
Almost two thirds of Fane Street PS pupils are from immigrant families.
NICEM has now admitted it was a "poor choice" to draw comparisons to loyalist attacks on Catholic pupils in 2001.
Fourteen years ago, the Holy Cross dispute in north Belfast made headlines around the world as loyalist residents staged protests against Catholic families walking their children to a school in the area.
Some of the protests outside Holy Cross Primary School became violent, and police in riot gear were deployed to protect the schoolgirls as they made their way to and from the school.
Mr Yu's previous comments, linking the 2001 dispute to the Fane Street Primary merger, provoked an angry response from local residents in south Belfast.
NICEM has formally objected to the Education Authority's plan to merge it with Blythefield Primary in Sandy Row and Donegall Road Primary in south Belfast.
Last week, Mr Yu said ethnic minority and Muslim families would be put at "high risk of racist attack and racial harassment" as they made their way to and from the proposed new school.
"We do not want to see another 'Holy Cross' number two to happen in that area," Mr Yu said at the time.
But after meeting community representatives from the Sandy Row, Donegall Road and Village areas on Tuesday, NICEM has issued a "sincere apology to the community for the statement that the merger had the potential of turning into a situation like Holy Cross".
"It was not, and has never been our aim to demonise or label any communities within Northern Ireland," the NICEM statement said.
"We acknowledge that using this comparison was a very poor choice."
South Belfast community worker and Alliance councillor for the area, Paula Bradshaw, welcomed Mr Yu's apology.
She said people in south Belfast recognised "there are issues" as the merger of three schools was "never going to be easy".
However, she said Monday's meeting with NICEM addressed how they could "move forward positively".
NICEM's statement said its complaints about how the education authorities had handled the merger process have not yet been resolved.
