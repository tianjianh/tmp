The 18-year-old has been linked with Premier League clubs in recent weeks.
"Ryan has put pen to paper on an extension to his contract that will keep him here for the foreseeable future," manager Neal Ardley told the Dons' website.
"It's great news and we want our young, talented players to be at the club for a long time."
Sweeney has impressed since being brought back into the first team last month, making nine of his 12 appearances for the club since then.
"My heart is set here. I want to play for Wimbledon," he said.
"I think I've progressed this season and especially over the last 18 months."
The exact length of his new contract has not been disclosed.
