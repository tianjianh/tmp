TEDxStormont has just been announced for the 28 March.
At the annual TED (Technology Entertainment and Design) conference, the world's brightest minds meet and share ideas.
The independently-organised Stormont event was launched with the aid of Snow Patrol singer Gary Lightbody, who will also speak at the event.
From its beginnings in California in 1984, TED has grown into a platform for world changers and visionaries.
The organisers invite artists, writers, scientists, designers and others to share one big idea or insight. The talks are then made available to view for free online.
Popular TED videos include: Schools Kill Creativity, Three Things I Learned While My Plane Crashed, Yup, I Built a Nuclear Reactor and When Ideas Have Sex.
Steve Jobs, Al Gore, Isabelle Allende, JK Rowling, Arianna Huffington and Julian Assange are just some of those who have spoken at previous TED events.
Starting from the theme of "imagine", TEDxStormont will look forward and explore the future of society in Northern Ireland and beyond.
Snow Patrol frontman Gary Lightbody said he was a "huge fan" of the TED phenomenon.
"I'm in a cast of quite awe-inspiring individuals and truly looking forward to it," he said.
"I'm honoured to be asked to speak at TEDxStormont. TEDx is a globally respected concept and fosters great innovation through the people it provides a platform to."
Other speakers announced so far include Kate Carroll, whose policeman husband was shot dead by dissident republicans, Apprentice contestant, Jim Eastwood, and the UUP MLA, Jo-Anne Dobson.
