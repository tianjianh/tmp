Japan's Matsuyama, the world number three, moved to eight under despite a stoppage of almost two hours because of potentially "dangerous" weather.
American Kisner carded a second straight four-under 67 at Quail Hollow.
The delay meant a host of players will return on Saturday at 12:30 BST to complete their second round.
Northern Irishman Rory McIlroy's one-over 72 left him 10 shots off the lead on two over.
Former world number one and 2015 US PGA champion Jason Day is third, two shots behind Matsuyama and Kisner, after a fine five-under-par 66 late in the day.
USA's Jordan Spieth, aiming to become the youngest player to complete the career Grand Slam, finished three over after a round of 73.
England's Paul Casey is the best placed British player at three under after a one-under-par 70.

Matsuyama, 25, was well fancied for the tournament having hit a final-round 61 to win the WGC Bridgestone Invitational last week.
He started the day three shots behind Kisner, who extended that gap as one of the early starters.
Matsuyama began with pars on the opening four holes and made birdies on the par-four fifth hole and par-five seventh.
He surged up the leaderboard with birdies on 12, 13, and 14 before the players were taken off the course because of the threat of thunderstorms and lightning.
Matsuyama birdied his first hole after the break and made a two on the par-three 17th to take a share of the lead.
"The important thing is to give myself an opportunity to win, keep knocking on the door and someday it will open," said Matsuyama, who is bidding to become the first Japanese man to win a major.
His round is the joint lowest so far along with Francesco Molinari. The Italian's 64 took him into fourth alongside Louis Oosthuizen of South Africa and USA's Chris Stroud on five under.
Spieth said he had to "make up ground" after his first round 72 but the second day saw him slip out of contention as he looks to complete the set of golf's four majors.
The 24-year-old managed just the one birdie and carded a third bogey of the round on the 18th to drop 11 shots off the pace.
That putt came after the hooter that signals players must finish the hole they are playing.
But there was still time for Day to complete the 18th, with the Australian earlier seen jogging from green to tee to complete his round.
In the end he missed a makeable putt for birdie on the final green meaning he had to settle for 66 and a two-shot deficit.

McIlroy, who trailed joint leader Kisner by five shots overnight, said he still felt "right in there" despite slipping further behind.
He began with four straight pars after missing the fairway on every hole, and needed a remarkable escape, hitting the ball up a cart path, to make par on his first hole, the 10th.
Although he found the bunker on the 15th, he holed a birdie putt to move to level par, and made par on 16, 17 and 18, the fearsome 'Green Mile'.
But McIlroy bogeyed four of five holes after the turn and at one stage drifted to four over, outside the projected cut at the time.
The four-time major winner then made successive birdies on the seventh and eighth to all but secure his place for the weekend, before just missing out on a third when his putt for a three on the par-four ninth stopped on the edge over the cup.
"Kis is on fire right now," said McIlroy. "But take him out of the equation - I feel like I'm still right there in the tournament."

England's Justin Rose shot a one-over 72 to slip to six over, outside the projected cut of five over.
Five-time major winner Phil Mickelson followed his first-round 79 with a three-over 74 and is now 11 over and will miss the cut for the second-consecutive major and for the first time at the US PGA since 1995.
England's Ross Fisher, Luke Donald ,Matthew Fitzpatrick and Danny Willett. plus Northern Ireland's Graeme McDowell, are among those outside of the cut lin.
But Ireland's Shane Lowry, along with Englishmen Lee Westwood, Chris Wood, Jordan Smith, Ian Poulter and Tommy Fleetwood all make the weekend.
