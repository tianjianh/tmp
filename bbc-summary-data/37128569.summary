Andrew Green, 33, was last seen driving away from Yew Tree Farm in Chorley, Shropshire, on 22 June.
Since appealing for him to come home, his parents Edward and Julie, have received offers via social media to help harvest their remaining 60 acres.
The couple said they would gratefully accept, once the weather improves.
Mrs Green told BBC News: "I can't believe it. I've been reading them out to Edward. He is overwhelmed with the offers. I don't think he could believe it."

Mr Green, 58, had recently been working from about 07:00 until 02:00 BST to harvest his farm that his son worked on and about 100 acres of land through contract harvesting.
The couple said they had received messages of help and support from locals as well as people from as far away as Australia.
Mr Green, who had been going through the breakdown of a relationship, was last seen by his partner after putting his two young daughters to bed.
His father said he saw him put a rope in his car earlier that day, but thought nothing of it at the time.
His vehicle was later found abandoned nearby with his phone and work keys inside.
"He's got no money, no passport," Mrs Green said.
"He's just got a rope and a photo of his children."
She said not knowing his whereabouts was terrible and the distraught couple were "trying to keep it together".
"We really miss him and just want him to come home," she said.
Hundreds of people helped the family and police search 2,000 acres of nearby woodland and farmland after he disappeared.
West Mercia Police has appealed for information in trying to trace him and said officers are working with the National Crime Agency and the Missing Persons Bureau.
