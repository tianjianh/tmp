[SN]TITLE[SN]
Peterborough United 4-2 Bristol Rovers

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Bristol Rovers' faint hopes of reaching the League One play-offs were extinguished after they were defeated at Peterborough.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Posh hit the front through Leo Da Silva Lopes' first league goal in the 13th minute, but the teenage prospect then conceded the penalty that gave Rovers a golden chance to level 10 minutes later.
However, Posh keeper Luke McGee denied Ellis Harrison and his side soon doubled their lead when Marcus Maddison lifted the ball over Joe Lumley in the 30th minute.
Posh further extended their advantage in the 56th minute when a Da Silva Lopes cross-shot squirmed through the legs of Lumley before Craig Mackail-Smith coolly finished after classily bringing down an exquisite Maddison pass seven minutes later.
Rovers halved their arrears thanks to two late goals from substitute Rory Gaffney.
He fired a low shot past McGee with six minutes to go before drilling in from an angle in stoppage time, but it was too little, too late.
