Jan Kozlowski was the first person in Scotland to be prosecuted under new road traffic laws designed to clamp down on banned drivers.
He admitted causing serious injury to the 15-year-old boy, who cannot be named for legal reasons.
A court heard the boy sustained a broken ankle in the collision.
Dundee Sheriff Court was told Kozlowski was banned from the road last June after admitting a drink driving offence.
He had previously been convicted of being in charge of a car while drunk.
Kozlowski, a labourer, was back behind the wheel just days later - driving his works van having failed to tell his employers of his ban.
He was driving on Dundee's Pitkerro Road on 9 June at about 18:20 when he hit the boy, who was crossing the road with friends.
Depute fiscal Eilidh Robertson said: "He stepped out between parked cars where he was struck by the motor van being driven by the accused.
"The accused did not swerve or sound his horn.
"He began to brake once hitting the boy and he remained on the bonnet of the van until the van came to a stop and he fell on to the roadway."
The boy was helped onto the pavement by his friends and Kozlowski and his brother got out of the van and approached them.
Miss Robertson said: "The accused assisted in helping the boy to his feet but said "your problem, not mine" before getting back in his vehicle and driving away."
Kozlowski, 40, a prisoner at HMP Perth, pleaded guilty to a charge of causing serious injury while driving while disqualified.
Defence solicitor Ross Donnelly said: "He accepts he should not have been driving in the first place."
Sheriff Tom Hughes jailed Kozlowski for a total of 18 months - 16 for the causing serious injury charge and two months over an unpaid fine.
He said: "This is a serious matter. You had been driving on the roads while ordered not to do so by the courts."
Kozlowski was also disqualified from driving for five years.
