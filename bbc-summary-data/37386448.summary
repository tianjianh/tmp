Uefa's executive committee has also recognised supporters from Wales and Iceland.
Each association will receive a commemorative plaque.
Northern Ireland and Republic of Ireland fans previously received an award from the mayor of Paris for their "exemplary sportsmanship" at Euro 2016.
Newly elected Uefa president Aleksander Ceferin said the association wanted to reward "some of the groups of supporters that were particularly enthusiastic and passionate during the tournament".
Thousands of fans from Northern Ireland and the Republic attended the Euro 2016 finals in France, with both teams reaching the knockout stages.
