Opposition to Inverness Castle becoming a hotel

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
People in Inverness do not want to see the city's castle turned into a hotel, according to the results of a survey.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Scottish Courts and Tribunals Service is to vacate Inverness Castle and set up a new justice centre.
The Scottish government has been working with Highland Council and others to plan future uses of the site.
Most respondents to a survey carried out by the organisations want to see it turned into a free-to-enter attraction, but not a hotel.
Business Minister Fergus Ewing said there was a desire to give the castle a "wow factor".
He said ideas put forward have included using it for musical recitals and major art exhibitions, and also making it into a museum about Scottish clans and tartans.
Sittings of the High Court, sheriff courts and other hearings have been held at the landmark 19th Century property for many years.
More recently there has been a campaign to have the site transformed into a visitor attraction.
The courts service said in December last year that it plans to move its business from the castle to a new centre within three years.
