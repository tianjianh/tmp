[SN]TITLE[SN]
John Parker murder: Man charged over stabbing death

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man has been charged over the death of another man who died from a single stab wound to the neck, in Nottingham.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
John Parker, 43, of Birkin Avenue, Hyson Green, was found in Hedderley Walk, in St Ann's, on Sunday, and died shortly after arriving at hospital.
Jonathan Jones, 39, of Barbury Drive, Clifton, is due to appear before magistrates charged with murder.
Detectives have more time to question another 39-year-old man who is also being detained on suspicion of murder.
A 14-year-old boy, arrested on suspicion of assisting an offender, has been released without charge.
A 35-year-old woman who was arrested on suspicion of GBH, which was related to an earlier incident involving the victim, has been bailed pending further inquiries.
Police still want to trace the occupants of a silver Ford Focus, which was seen in the Hedderley Walk area at the time of the incident.
It is not believed the occupants of the car were involved in the incident, but they may have more information.
