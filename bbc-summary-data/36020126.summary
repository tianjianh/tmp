The League Two outfit have only three players contracted beyond the end of this term.
Newport are 11-points clear of the League Two relegation zone, though Feeney is their third manager of a a disrupted season that has seen the Exiles use over 40 different players.
"I want to bring my own boys in, I'm not going to lie," Feeney said.
"I know what I need in the summer and what I want but it's about getting over that line first," the manager told BBC Wales Sport.
"There are some that will be [here next year] but, no disrespect, you've got to move on and bring your own players in - that's what you're judged on.
"That's what I want and unfortunately that's football."
The Exiles lost for the fifth game in succession last time out as Cambridge United kept up their late push for the National League play-offs.
Feeney feels the club needs new players to avoid a repeat of a campaign struggling at the foot of League Two.
"At the moment I just want to get these players over the line," he said.
"They've been brilliant for me but you look at these teams that are challenging and they have the mentality to win promotions.
"People will bounce off that and that's what I want to bring to this club.
"A lot of our boys have come from the league below or have had relegations in this league.
"You want to make them better but you look for that little bit of quality to grind games out.
"Players are available in the summer and people are playing for their futures."
