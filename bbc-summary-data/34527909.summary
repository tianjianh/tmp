[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man who went on the run for more than a decade has been jailed for trafficking heroin worth more than £200,000 into Aberdeen.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Scott Coleman, 41, from Liverpool, was caught in 2003 but was freed on bail and failed to reappear.
He was finally detained in Amsterdam earlier this year before being extradited.
Coleman admitted being concerned in the supply of heroin and was jailed for five years.
Lord Glennie jailed him for four years for his involvement in the heroin supply and a further year for failing to appear.
The judge told him at the High Court in Edinburgh: "The court cannot turn a blind eye to this flaunting of its authority."
Coleman is also wanted by the Spanish authorities after he was sentenced in his absence to more than six years imprisonment for a drugs offence there.
Defence solicitor advocate Ewen Roy said Coleman made "a series of dreadful decisions" some time ago.
He said that before he became involved in bringing drugs to Scotland he had no involvement in crime, but was under financial pressure at the time.
Coleman acted as a courier in the supply of drugs from Merseyside to the north east of Scotland.
A major police operation targeting the large scale illegal trade resulted in the jailing of brothers Derek and Jason McAllister for 12 and 10 years in 2006.
