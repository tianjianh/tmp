[SN]TITLE[SN]
Dover Athletic 3-1 Chester

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Dover ended a three-match winless run with an emphatic victory over Chester at Crabble.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Ricky Miller ended a run of two games without a goal with a penalty in the 26th minute, sending Liam Roberts the wrong way after his own trickery in the box drew the foul from Chester's Matthew Waters.
James Alabi was a constant threat for Chester and he showed great strength with his back to goal to spin and lash home an equaliser on the half-hour mark.
Miller then raced clear of the visitors' backline and finished his 29th goal of the season after 49 minutes, before Joe Healy completed the scoring with a superb volley from the edge of the box nine minutes later.
