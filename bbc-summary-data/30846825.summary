Lorraine McKeag, 60, from Dundry near Bristol, was driving on the roundabout where the M32 links with the M4 when her car collided with a lorry.
She died at the scene and the road was shut for more than seven hours.
"To know her was an absolute joy," read a family tribute released through Avon and Somerset Police.
Her husband of 28 years died in 2012, eight years after a "serious and debilitating" stroke. The couple have one son, James, who is 24-years-old.
"Her popularity grew within the village year on year, and she was well known across the Chew Valley for her two golden retrievers and tireless help and support to all", her family wrote. "Lorraine will be missed immensely by her son, sister, family and friends."
Her son James is running three marathons in her memory including events in Paris, Manchester and London, all in April. He has already raised more than Â£2,000 for the Stroke Association.
