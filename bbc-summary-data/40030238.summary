John Atkinson, 28, from Radcliffe in Bury, was among 22 people who died when a suicide bomber attacked concertgoers at Manchester Arena on Monday.

"John tragically lost his life... in the Manchester MEN bomb attack," wrote Ms Dickenson.
"A true gentleman. R.I.P John thoughts and prayers with you family and all of the other victims affected by this tragedy," she said.
