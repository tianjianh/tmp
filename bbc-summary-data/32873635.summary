The squad paraded down Victoria Avenue in Southend at lunchtime before turning into London Road.
The honour came after the squad won 7-6 on penalties against Wycombe Wanderers.
Blues' club boss Phil Brown said it had been "a phenomenal season" and the team had shown "their never-say-die attitude again".
He added: "The last time I was at Wembley in a play-off final was with Hull City. Winning that day was special, but this feels even better.
"The young lads and the old lads did themselves proud."
