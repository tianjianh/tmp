Now he's going to be able to add the latest X-Men film to his CV, after its director Bryan Singer announced his appointment on Instagram.
Smit-McPhee will be joining a cast which includes Sophie Turner, Alexandra Shipp and Tye Sheridan.
They'll be playing a young Jean Grey, Storm and Cyclops respectively.
Smit-McPhee will play a youthful Nightcrawler.
Bryan Singer says he's "excited" at the prospect of the young actor playing the role.
In his own Instagram post, the 18-year-old says he feels privileged to get the role.
"I am humbled and honoured to be joining this incredible project and to be able to tell the story of the well respected young mutant Nightcrawler."
Sir Patrick Stewart and Sir Ian McKellen revealed last year that they would not be appearing in the film.
Stewart said: "It is going to be looking very much at the earlier lives of all our characters. And so I don't think we'll be making an appearance. Nor Sir Ian McKellen, either."
Apocalypse will be the eighth film in the superhero series, which includes two Wolverine spin-off movies.
The first film in the X-Men series came out in 2000.
X-Men: Apocalypse is due out in 2016.
