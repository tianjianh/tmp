Oldham 'urinating' row: Man jailed for assaulting 70-year-old

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man who attacked a 70-year-old man who asked him to stop urinating against the wall of his partner's house has been jailed for 15 months.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Stephen Glynn, 46, left Derek Laidlaw with a broken nose and bruises to the head during the assault in Failsworth, Oldham, on 2 July.
Glynn, of Massey Avenue, Failsworth, had previously admitted assault causing actual bodily harm.
He was sentenced at a hearing at Manchester Minshull Street Crown Court.
The court heard the pensioner had returned from a family celebration to find a pizza box on his car and Glynn outside his partner's home.
Glynn pinned him against the wall and punched him repeatedly during the confrontation, the jury heard.
The attack only stopped when Mr Laidlaw's partner of nine years, Marsha Jackson, stopped a van passing by and Glynn left the scene.
The defendant pleaded guilty on 11 July, during a hearing at Tameside Magistrates' Court.
