The conditions at Glencoe Mountain Resort, which are highly sought after by skiers and snowboarders, followed heavy snowfalls over the last few days.
Snowaction magazine has rated the centre as having the best powder snow of any of the world's ski resorts at the moment.
The last day of skiing at Glencoe for the 2014-15 season is 4 May.
A spokesperson for Glencoe Mountain said: "Conditions for this time of year are truly exceptional.
"The conditions are more like what you would expect on a midwinter.
"Normally by the May weekend we are skiing on large patches of snow."
