Didcot A demolition: Main building blown up

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Explosions will be heard across the Oxfordshire countryside on Saturday as part of the main building at Didcot A Power Station is demolished.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Three of its six cooling towers were blown up in July last year.
A section of the 48m (157ft)-high main building is expected to come down between 09:00 and 11:00 BST.
Part of the A4130 will be closed at Southmead Industrial Estate during that time. The rest of the main building will be demolished next year.
Hundreds of people turned out to watch the first towers come down last year, despite warnings of a huge dust cloud.
A spokeswoman said the building had been washed down to minimise the amount dust created by the latest blast.
The demolition of Didcot A, which was decommissioned in March 2013, started almost two years ago.
The northern cooling towers and chimney are expected to be demolished next spring and summer, with full clearance of the site expected by September 2016.
