England U21 5-0 Bosnia-Herzegovina U21

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
England Under-21s finished their European Championship qualifying campaign in style by thrashing Bosnia-Herzegovina in Walsall.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
England had already sealed their place at next summer's finals and went ahead with a drive by Reading's John Swift.
On-loan Bristol City striker Tammy Abraham acrobatically added a second and calmly dinked in the fifth.
In between, Tottenham's Josh Onomah stroked in and Sunderland's Duncan Watmore rolled in a fourth.
The under-21s were led by Aidy Boothroyd after coach Gareth Southgate stepped up to take interim charge of the senior side.
Under Southgate, they won the Toulon tournament in May for the first time since 1994 and have now completed this qualifying campaign by finishing top of their group with an unbeaten record.
Boothroyd has now won his two games in charge after his side controlled the game against Bosnia, with midfielder Jack Grealish particularly impressive.
The Aston Villa man laid on Swift for the opener, before an inch-perfect through ball for Watmore's effort.
Manager Aidy Boothroyd: "I am really pleased, it was a banana skin against a team with nothing to lose. The performance was excellent, very professional. We defended well by keeping a clean sheet and the attacking play had some great passing moves and top finishing."
Man of the match Jack Grealish: "We did not want any complacency and did the job well. There were nine changes today but we still put in a good performance."
Striker Tammy Abraham: "I am over the moon to get the two goals. Whatever team that is put out is fantastic, we have great togetherness and want to achieve the best."
