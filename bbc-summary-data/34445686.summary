[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A kitten has survived being driven around in a car engine for a week.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Mike Dunn from Lower Gornal near Dudley, said he was out driving when a cat and two young kittens ran out in front of him.
When Mr Dunn stopped, the kittens vanished under the car. Despite searching, he could not see them.
A week later, he found the seven-week-old kitten - now named "Lucky" - perched on the heat shield of the catalytic converter in the engine.
It is thought she travelled about 150 miles inside the Mazda MX-5 before she was discovered.
Lucky, who only suffered a minor burn, now lives with Mr Dunn and his family.
