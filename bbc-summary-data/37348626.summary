Restoration plans for Wroxham Island dropped by Natural England

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A conservation body awarded £4m of public money has been criticised after it dropped plans to restore an island on the Norfolk Broads.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
European Union and lottery funds will be spent restoring the privately-owned Hoveton Great Broad and Hudson's Bay lakes, which the public cannot access.
Campaigners said restoration of Wroxham Island was a "benefit to the public in an otherwise private project".
Natural England said funders had "declined to fund" work to the island.
But the Heritage Lottery Fund, which granted £1.9m of the cash, said Natural England removed the plans to restore the island from its bid.
European funding from EU Life contributed just over €3m (£2.57m) towards the scheme.
Norfolk and Suffolk Boating Association said it was "affronted and disappointed" by the conservation body's decision.
Campaigner Sue Hines, who set up a petition opposing the scheme, was "deeply disappointed" the island's eroded banks were not going to be restored.
She said: "This part of the project, paid for by public funds, was a small, redeeming feature giving some benefit to the public in an otherwise private project."
Hoveton Great Broad and Hudson's Bay are part of the Blofeld family estate, which includes the Bewilderwood theme park, and the lakes have been leased to Natural England for 25 years.
Natural England said the scheme's public benefits include a better ferry service, an improved nature trail and a 1.5km (One mile) guided canoe trail.
However, public navigational boats will not be allowed at the two Norfolk Broads lakes, to protect their flora and fauna.
The project will be used to restore the lakes' degraded waters and ecology.
Broads Authority planners approved the change in the plan and said it was "unable to take into account anything other than planning issues when making its decision".
