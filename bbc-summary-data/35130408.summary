An off-duty inspector found the girl in Grange Lane, Lye, near Pedmore Technology College, Stourbridge.
Police are seeking a light grey or blue vehicle in connection with the crash.
Sgt Steve Newbury said: "It's shocking to think someone could leave a child seriously hurt in the street, drive off and make no effort to get her medical treatment."

He added: "Clearly this is distressing at any time for the girl's family, but to happen just days before Christmas is truly heartbreaking."
The girl suffered a fractured skull and internal injuries in the crash, thought to have happened just before 22:00 GMT on Thursday.
A spokesman for West Midlands Ambulance Service said it was clear "the 15-year-old had multiple serious injuries" and there was no car at the location.
"She was treated at the scene by ambulance staff before being taken to Russells Hall Hospital."
Her condition on arrival there was described as critical but stable.
