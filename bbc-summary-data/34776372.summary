The 30-year-old, who has taken 198 wickets at an average of 29.87 in 57 Tests, played for Notts in 2014.
He will be available for County Championship and 50-over cricket.
"Notts have had a strong batting line-up for a long time and with some young bowlers also coming through, I'm excited by the way the squad is shaping up," Siddle said.
Siddle took 37 wickets in 11 County Championship matches for Notts in 2014.
He claimed 18 at 20.55 apiece in four games for Lancashire last season before Australia's Ashes campaign in England.
Siddle made his Test debut in 2008, took an Ashes hat-trick in 2010 and has claimed four five-wicket hauls against England, including 5-50 at Trent Bridge in 2013.
He is currently part of the squad for the home series against New Zealand and will arrive at Trent Bridge after the Australian season ends in March.
Notts director of cricket Mick Newell said: "He will provide leadership to our young bowling attack.
"He's very much suited to English conditions and we're certainly hoping to get the best out of him for the next couple of seasons."
