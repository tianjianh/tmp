The father of missing chef Claudia Lawrence has said he is "disappointed" no charges have been brought during the seven year investigation.

The Crown Prosecution Service said it would not be charging four men arrested last year in connection with the case.
Miss Lawrence, 35, disappeared after leaving her house on Heworth Road in York on 19 March in 2009.
Peter Lawrence said he remained hopeful someone would still come forward with information.
"I am disappointed that after such a long and expensive police investigation into Claudia's disappearance and possible murder no-one is to be prosecuted," he said.
"However, prosecution and even conviction would not bring Claudia back to us and may well not have resulted in revealing where she is buried, if she was murdered.
"Someone knows what happened on that day seven years ago and they should now come forward to tell us where our darling daughter, and Ali's loving sister, is.
"I have always said that the not knowing is the hardest thing for the family to bear."
The four men, who are all in their 50s and from the York area, were arrested in March and April of last year as part of a review of the initial investigation into the case.
North Yorkshire Police said up to 20 detectives and police staff had worked full-time on the review for more than two years at a cost of nearly Â£800,000.
Det Supt Dai Malyn, who led the investigation, said he understood the frustration of the Lawrence family.
"We have made progress but the public are the key and somebody or some persons out there have the information that will assist us in unlocking this."
