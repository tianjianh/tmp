[SN]TITLE[SN]
Lewis Macleod in Scotland Under-21s squad for double-header

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Lewis Macleod has been recalled to Scotland's Under-21 squad for the European Championship qualifiers against Macedonia and Ukraine.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Brentford midfielder has been a regular in the Championship so far this season after an injury-hit 18 months.
Both goalkeepers picked by coach Ricky Sbragia - Mark Hurst and Liam Kelly - and defender Liam Smith are previously uncapped at under-21 level.
The Scots host Macedonia on 2 September then play Ukraine away four days later.
Scotland currently sit fourth in their qualifying group on eight points - six behind leaders France, who have played a game more.
The nine group winners will automatically progress to join hosts Poland in next year's finals while the four best runners-up will compete in play-offs to decide the final two entrants.
Iceland, who like Scotland have a game in hand, are currently second on 12 points with Macedonia also four points ahead of the Scots.
Goalkeepers: Mark Hurst (St Johnstone), Liam Kelly (Livingston)
Defenders: Dominic Hyan (Reading), Stephen Kingsley (Swansea), Donald Love (Sunderland), Callum McFadzean (Kilmarnock), Jordan McGhee (Hearts), Mark O'Hara (Dundee), Liam Smith (Hearts), John Souttar (Hearts)
Midfielders: Ryan Gauld (Vitoria de Setubal), Liam Henderson (Celtic), Lewis Macleod (Brentford), Craig Slater (Colchester), Craig Storie (Aberdeen)
Forwards: Ryan Christie (Celtic), Jason Cummings, (Hibernian), Ryan Fraser (Bournemouth), Billy King (Inverness), Oliver McBurnie (Swansea), Sam Nicholson (Hearts)
