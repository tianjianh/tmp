Davis Cup: Glasgow to host due to Florence and Machine gig

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Lawn Tennis Association has failed to persuade Florence and the Machine to change the date of their show at the Manchester Arena so the venue could host Britain's Davis Cup semi-final.

Glasgow's Emirates Arena is now expected to stage Team GB's meeting with Australia from 18-20 September.
The LTA also looked into holding the tie at the Hydro in Glasgow but found the roof would not be high enough.
Andy Murray helped Team GB beat France in the quarter-final at Queen's Club.
The LTA's chief executive Michael Downey has had "several conversations" with Florence's agent, but was told her gig at Manchester Arena - which has a capacity of over 20,000 - on the Friday of Britain's Davis Cup semi-final must go ahead as planned.
The LTA has been granted an extra five days to nominate a venue for the tie, with Glasgow now expected to be confirmed before next Wednesday's deadline.
The Emirates staged Britain's first-round victory over the United States, and a plan is in place to expand the capacity of the arena to 9,000 in time for the semi-final.
