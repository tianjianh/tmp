The ballot is getting under way in the contest for the leadership of the Scottish Labour Party.

The vote is a choice between MSPs Kezia Dugdale and Ken Macintosh, with the result expected on 15 August.
The election was prompted by the resignation of Jim Murphy after the party's MPs were almost wiped out in Scotland at the general election.
It will be a one member one vote ballot, while non-members can  register as supporters to take part.
Glasgow City Council leader Gordon Matheson and MSPs Alex Rowley and Richard Baker are standing for deputy.
Ahead of the ballot, Ms Dugdale said: "I am honoured to have received the backing of the overwhelming majority of local parties, trade unions and elected representatives who have nominated a candidate.
"The task in the weeks ahead is to convert that support into votes."
She added: "We need to catch up with the people of Scotland or risk getting left behind for good.
"People in Scotland are ambitious - for themselves, their family and their community. The Labour Party must prove that we are as ambitious as the people of Scotland."
The two leadership contenders will go head-to-head in a live TV debate on the BBC later this month.
Mr Macintosh said: "From Monday, my team of volunteers will be hitting the phones to get the message of change across.
"I am offering something different. I want to take our party in a new direction, more collaborative, more positive and more forward looking."
He added: "I have been clear from day one about how I will reclaim our party to rebuild the trust we have lost. These have not just been words - I have laid out in some detail the practical changes I will make and the policies I will pursue.
"Under my leadership, Scottish Labour will be driven by our positive vision for Scotland's future and not by our opposition to the SNP."
