Manager Brendan Rodgers is having an "incredible experience" at Celtic as he prepares for his first match in England since leaving Liverpool.

Celtic travel to Manchester City on Tuesday for their final Champions League game and will finish bottom of Group C regardless of the result.
Rodgers took on the Celtic job in the summer, having been sacked by the Anfield club in October 2015.
"My intention is to be here as long as I can, to help the club grow," he said.
"The most important thing for me is to be happy," added the 43-year-old Northern Irishman. "It is about enjoying my life. I am living the dream.
"I took a period of time out after leaving Liverpool and I needed to ensure that when I came back it wasn't for one or two seasons.
"Dermot Desmond [majority shareholder] and Peter Lawwell [chief executive] really sold the club to me. For me, the biggest thing was to have the challenge of working somewhere different. It is a huge privilege being at Celtic.
"I don't see it as a stepping stone.
"I'm going to be coaching hopefully for another 20-odd years, and it is highly unlikely I'm going to be at Celtic for 20 years because of how the modern game works, but at this moment I'm very, very happy.
"If I'm happy, I'm winning. And I don't necessarily need to be working in the Premier League to be winning."
Rodgers' side remain unbeaten domestically, but Celtic have picked up just two points in Group C, the first from a thrilling 3-3 draw with Manchester City at Celtic Park.
That ended an opening run of 10 wins for Pep Guardiola's side and City have stuttered since, dropping to fourth in the Premier League.
Rodgers added that he is a "huge admirer" of the Spaniard, saying: "Pep is a top-class manager, he has proven that.
"But the Premier League is different. In order to impose his style he'll probably be looking to get in a few more players who can really function and provide the foundation for how he wants to work.
"I've played against Manchester City over a number of years and I can tell the difference in terms of the intensity he has brought and with their flexibility in different systems.
"He won't have had this sort of competition before. The Premier League is the most competitive league in the world."
