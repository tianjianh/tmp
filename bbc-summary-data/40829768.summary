Hooker Vicky Fleetwood will also remain in England for the next few days to undergo rehab for a minor injury.
Forward Poppy Cleall, who has won 12 caps for England, including their 2017 Six Nations Grand Slam, has been called up as a replacement.
England begin their campaign against Spain in Dublin on Wednesday.
England women head coach Simon Middleton said: 'While it's disappointing for Emily, we know she will rehab diligently and we hope to have her fit and ready on standby if required later in the tournament.
"With Vicky remaining in England for the time being, we have opted to call up Poppy, who offers us a bit more balance in the forwards"

Forwards: Zoe Aldcroft, Sarah Bern, Rochelle Clark, Amy Cokayne, Vickii Cornborough, Sarah Hunter (C), Heather Kerr, Justine Lucas, Alex Matthews, Harriet Millar-Mills, Izzy Noel-Smith, Marlie Packer, Abbie Scott, Tamara Taylor, Poppy Cleall.
