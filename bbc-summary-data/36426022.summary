A disused Ipswich church that dates back to the 15th Century could be given a new lease of life as an arts centre.

St Clement's Church, on Star Lane, has been closed since 1979 but a campaign was launched two years ago to convert it into an arts venue.
Ipswich Borough Council, which owns the building, has approved a change of use.
Simon Hallsworth, who is involved in the project, said: "It's one of the most beautiful spaces in the region and we intend to bring it back to life."
Mr Hallsworth said the 250-400 capacity centre, which is being overseen by a community interest group, would fill a gap in the town.
"We're responding to a need," he said. "There's been a movement in Ipswich calling for a mid-sized venue for almost 30 years.
"We anticipate making it a very flexible space. We're trying to reconcile two aims - one is to bring the kind of acts who don't come into Ipswich, and also to allow it to be a home for a whole series of other artistic events.
"We don't want to nail ourselves to one demographic or art form."
The council said Ipswich Arts Centre could open up as a "pop-up venue" while fundraising efforts continued, ahead of more permanent building work.
