Officials said the man was standing behind a protective fence at a bullring on Wednesday when the bull charged.
One of the bull's horns went between the barrier bars, piercing the man's abdomen and chest.
Fiestas featuring bulls are common in Spain, but critics and aficionados say that the events are dangerous.
The man, who hailed from a nearby village, was quickly removed from the scene soon after the incident and transferred to hospital for emergency treatment, but he succumbed to his injuries.
A video of the bull charging at the man has been published on several Spanish news outlets.
According to Spain's hoy news website, the town of Coria last experienced a death by bull goring in 2007.
