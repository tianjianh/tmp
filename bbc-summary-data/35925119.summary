The trade in fake goods is putting hundreds of jobs at risk, experts have warned, as a BBC investigation shows the extent of the black market in England's biggest cities.

Trading standards figures showed hotspots in Manchester, Birmingham and Newham in east London.
Commonly copied items included Beats by Dr Dre headphones, branded phone covers and cigarettes.
The Anti-Counterfeiting Group said some fakes were "potentially lethal".
Our investigation revealed:
BBC News asked for records from the 10 most populated cities in England under the Freedom of Information Act. We contacted councils in London, Birmingham, Sheffield, Manchester, Liverpool, Bristol, Leicester and West Yorkshire, where a joint trading standards team covers Leeds, Wakefield and Bradford.
Liverpool City Council and Sheffield were unable to provide a full breakdown and Bristol City Council has yet to respond. London boroughs Westminster, Waltham Forest, Richmond and Merton refused to answer.

Clothing and accessories made up almost a third of all goods seized. The next most common category was mobile phone accessories, with covers often depicting either products, such as the Apple iPhone, or other famous brands.
According to the latest UK Intellectual Property Crime Report, the five main countries of origin for counterfeit goods are China, Hong Kong, Pakistan, India and Turkey.
A spokeswoman for the Anti-Counterfeiting Group said it was difficult to get a true picture of the scale of the problem because of differences in the way councils record their figures.
However, she said: "We have seen a reduction in anti-counterfeiting activity because of the serious cutbacks trading standards have and still are facing.
"There is definitely a rise in counterfeit items on the UK market.
"We would like to see a change in strategic priorities by recognition of the link between organised crime and counterfeiting.
And she warned that people buying fake goods are putting themselves at risk.
"The criminal gangs that make these products have no regard for health or safety and as such, products are not being tested to the high UK standards and are therefore potentially lethal to the British consumer," she explained.
Leon Livermore, Chartered Trading Standards Institute chief executive, said people did not realise the damage they were doing to legitimate businesses.
"Hundreds of jobs are being lost in sectors that encompass many small businesses, vulnerable to collapse," he said.
"Worryingly, 24% of people have knowingly bought counterfeit goods and a further 21% would consider it to save money."
Since 2013, trading standards in seven of the 10 biggest cities revealed they had seized at least 6,531 sets of headphones or ear buds sold as either Beats or Beats by Dre.
The figure is likely to be even higher as in some cases the headphones were seized among other goods and a breakdown was not available.
Genuine headphones sell for up to £270 a pair.
In one incident alone in the M8 postcode area of Manchester, there were 2,115 fake sets found in May 2014.
Trading standards in Hillingdon in London also found 1,651 sets of counterfeit headphones in February 2013.
Apple, which owns Beats, has been approached for a comment.
Other notable seizures included:
£39,000
value of a Rolex watch copied and confiscated in Greenwich
£35,075 value of 7,015 tobacco items seized in Birmingham on one day
25,612 clothes in one haul in Manchester, value unknown
£7,500 lost VAT from £30k of phone accessories in Wandsworth
In a report on the counterfeit trade in Cheetham Hill in January 2016, Baroness Neville-Rolfe, minister for intellectual property, said: "This trade, where income tax and consumer safety is simply ignored, undercuts and undermines legitimate businesses and allows other criminality to be funded and flourish."
