Ashraf Fayadh: Readings for Palestinian poet facing death

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Hundreds of writers are taking part in readings in support of the Palestinian poet Ashraf Fayadh, who has been sentenced to death in Saudi Arabia.

More than 120 events are being held in 44 countries on Thursday as part of a campaign organised by the International Literature Festival Berlin.
It is calling on the US and UK governments to intervene on behalf of Mr Fayadh, who is accused of apostasy.
He denies the charges and claims that another man made false accusations.
Human rights activists also say Mr Fayadh was denied access to a lawyer throughout his detention and trial, in clear violation of Saudi and international law.
Mr Fayadh, a 35-year-old poet and art curator who was born in Saudi Arabia to Palestinian refugee parents, has been a key figure in taking Saudi contemporary art to a global audience, according to the International Literature Festival Berlin.
Chris Dercon, the director of Tate Modern gallery in London and a friend of the poet, has described him as "someone who is outspoken and daring".
Mr Fayadh was arrested in August 2013 following a complaint by a Saudi citizen, who alleged that he was promoting atheism and spreading blasphemous ideas, according to Amnesty International.
He was released the next day, but was rearrested in January 2014 and charged with apostasy because of his supposed questioning of religion and spreading atheist thought through his collection of poetry, Instructions Within, published in 2008.
He was also charged with violating the country's anti-cyber crime law by taking and storing photos of women on his mobile phone.
In April 2014, the General Court in the city of Abha sentenced Mr Fayadh to four years in prison and 800 lashes for violating the anti-cyber crime law. But it found his repentance in relation to the charge of apostasy to be satisfactory and not requiring further punishment.
However, an appeals court overturned his original sentence and sent the case back to the General Court, which sentenced him to death for apostasy on 17 November.
Mr Fayadh has asserted that the poems are "just about me being [a] Palestinian refugee... about cultural and philosophical issues. But the religious extremists explained it as destructive ideas against God."
Irvine Welsh, who will read at the Two Hearted Queen coffee shop in Chicago on Thursday, said he hoped the worldwide reading campaign would put "pressure on governments who espouse democracy and freedom to consider their actions in dealing with [Saudi Arabia]", according to the Guardian newspaper.
A L Kennedy, who will be attending a reading organised by PEN England at the Mosaic Rooms in west London, said Mr Fayadh's persecution was "very obviously unjust and morally repellent".
The Saudi government has not commented publicly on Mr Fayadh's case.
