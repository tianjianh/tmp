Steve McClaren: Derby County re-appoint former boss

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Former England boss Steve McClaren has been confirmed as Derby County's new manager, just 17 months after he was sacked by the Championship club.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
McClaren, 55, replaces Nigel Pearson, who left by mutual consent on Saturday after less than five months, with temporary boss Chris Powell returning to his role as assistant manager.
"I regret how my time at Derby ended in 2015," said McClaren.
"I am very motivated to put things right for the club and supporters."
McClaren left Derby in acrimonious circumstances in May 2015 following constant speculation linking him with the job at Newcastle.
He subsequently joined the Magpies but was sacked in March 2016.
Derby president and chief executive Sam Rush said: "We enjoyed some fantastic and memorable moments under Steve during his previous tenure in charge.
"Steve's arrival and subsequent work helped transform how we played our football.
"Steve's time at Derby came to a premature end and I know he regrets that greatly. He values hugely his relationship with our supporters and I know that he will work very hard to ensure that the special connection returns."
