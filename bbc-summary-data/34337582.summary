The Bolton fighter, 27, took his seat at the event in London on Wednesday, before leaping over his table to tackle someone dressed as The Joker.
He then turned to Klitschko and said: "This is a fool, just like you are."
Fury takes on the Ukrainian boxer, 39, for his WBA, IBF and WBO titles in Dusseldorf, Germany on 24 October.
Klitschko has not lost for 11 years.

Fury, who is unbeaten in 24 fights, successfully defended his European heavyweight title in London in March and has previously taunted Klitschko.
In July, Fury described him as "boring", adding: "You have about as much charisma as my underpants - zero."
Next month's fight will be a record-breaking 28th heavyweight title bout for Klitschko and his 19th defence in his second reign as world champion.
