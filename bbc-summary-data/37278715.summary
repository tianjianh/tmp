[SN]TITLE[SN]
Haverfordwest market to make way for £3.4m library

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Plans to transform an indoor market into a county library for Pembrokeshire were backed on Tuesday.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The council wants to convert the Riverside market in Haverfordwest into a library, gallery and cafe.
Pembrokeshire council has received a £285,000 grant from the Welsh Government towards the £3.4m scheme.
The planning committee voted to give the head of planning the power to approve the plans after the consultation ends.
The council anticipates the new library could generate close to £1m of spending in the local economy and create eight to 15 additional jobs.
The consultation ends on 13 September.
