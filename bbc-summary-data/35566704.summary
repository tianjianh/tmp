The visiting defender miscued an attempted clearance into his own net shortly after the interval.
Watford, who made six changes, just about deserved victory, with Miguel Britos and Almen Abdi going close and Etienne Capoue having a goal ruled out.
Leeds' best moment came when Stuart Dallas curled a low effort wide.
But it was a largely disappointing display from the Yorkshire side, who have not made the last eight of the FA Cup since 2003.
Although they were limited in attack, Leeds had defended stoutly for 53 minutes - restricting Watford to just one shot on target - and the match looked to be petering out to an inevitable replay.
But that was before Wootton's inexplicable intervention.
Ben Watson's cross had eluded everyone and was curling harmlessly out of danger when Wootton - playing out of position at right-back - attempted to touch it behind and instead succeeded only in slicing it comically into his own net.
The 24-year-old was visibly distraught, burying his head in his hands and having to be consoled by team-mate Giuseppe Bellusci, and manager Steve Evans said after the match it was "probably the lowest point of Wootton's life".
With Leeds toothless going forward, the former Manchester United youngster's error was always likely to prove decisive.
Hornets boss Quique Sanchez Flores handed an opportunity to several of his reserve players, with striker Nordin Amrabat and midfielder Mario Suarez - signed in January for £6m and £4m respectively - among those brought in.
But the new players failed to catch the eye, with Moroccan international Amrabat having just one shot and 28 touches - 26 fewer than any other Watford outfield starter.
Suarez was scarcely more impressive in the centre of the park - winning only 40% of his duels - while goalkeeper Costel Pantilimon, replacing Heurelho Gomes, barely had a save to make.
Instead, it was regular midfielders Ben Watson and Capoue - who saw a goal chalked off for an off-the-ball push by Troy Deeney - who were by far Watford's most impressive performers.
Watford manager Quique Sanchez Flores: "To win the match is the most important thing for us, and to avoid a replay for us. We were better in the second half than the first half. We took control with the ball and we had more attempts."
Flores on midfielder Suarez and striker Amrabat, handed rare starts: "They are completely ready to be protagonists in the team, they are very important players."
Leeds manager Steve Evans: "I think the performance was good. It was the cruellest way ever to go out of the FA Cup - it was a terrible goal to concede. We dominated the quality of the play until half-time. If you came here in the first half, you'd have thought Leeds United were the Premier League team.
"Scott Wootton's in tears, he's apologised to every member of staff and he'll not sleep for days.
"The time wasting [by Watford] was like something you'd see abroad, you don't want to see that in English football."
Both sides return to league action: Watford take on Bournemouth on Saturday, while Leeds host Fulham on Tuesday.
