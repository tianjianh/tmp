PC James Patterson said "adrenaline kicked in" when he was called to the emergency at the River Trent in Nottingham.
The officer ran from Nottingham Forest's City Ground stadium, dived into the water and managed to reach the man, who was already unconscious.
The victim was then revived and taken to hospital, where he is recovering.
The drama unfolded on Saturday when PC Patterson was policing Nottingham Forest's match against Sheffield Wednesday.
Three other policemen helped in the rescue, and all four have been recommended for an award or commendation by Nottinghamshire Police.
PC Patterson, a qualified lifesaver who swims for the GB police swim team, stripped off his uniform before entering the fast-flowing water.
His colleague PC Paul Easter tied ropes to a life ring and held on as PC Patterson swam to the middle of the river.
He had just two metres (6.5ft) left on the rope by the time he reached the man.
The officers then revived the man before he was transferred to the Queen's Medical Centre.
A strong swimmer, PC Patterson won a bronze in the 50m freestyle at the British Masters Championship in 2016.
He said it was "one of those rare moments where you actually look in the mirror and think 'well done you'".
Sgt Julian Smedley, of Nottinghamshire Police, said: "These officers conducted themselves in a truly inspirational way.
"PC Patterson displayed true courage, selfless commitment and determination. He gave no thought for his own safety."
