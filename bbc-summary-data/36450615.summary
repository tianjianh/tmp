Rachel Corsie admits the pressure is now on Scotland Women to make amends for their thumping 4-0 home defeat to Iceland on Friday.

Hopes of sealing automatic qualification for Euro 2017 suffered a blow as Iceland leapfrogged them in Group 1 in a one-sided match.
Kim Little also missed a penalty for the hosts at the Falkirk Stadium.
"This time there is an expectation to qualify so it is a different pressure for us," said defender Corsie.
"We need to be better, we will be better. We've been in this position before and we've not quite made it over the finish line and there is pressure for us this time to qualify, and we want to qualify automatically so we need to get the job done."
Scotland are already assured of a top-two spot in their group but are desperate to avoid more play-off heartbreak.
They lost play-offs to Russia and Spain to miss out on the last two European Championships, and then to the Netherlands while falling short of reaching the 2015 World Cup.
This time the eight group winners and six best runners-up qualify automatically, with the two remaining second-place finishers facing a play-off.
Scotland now have two qualifying games remaining as they bid to qualify for their first-ever major championship, starting on Tuesday away to Belarus before meeting Iceland again in September.
"There's nothing better than having a game so quickly to bounce back and I think that's the feeling amongst everyone in the team," said Seattle Reign's Corsie.
"Everyone's really disappointed with how they played individually and collectively how we performed, so we can bounce back and we can do that Tuesday.
"If we get a positive result, we go into the final game in a really promising position.
"There's always pressure in those games because we're expected to win, but equally it's a difficult place to go.
"I've never played in Belarus before, but I know from playing them at home they're tough to beat, they get bodies behind the ball and they play on the counter attack, which is something that we need to be wary of."
Scotland beat Belarus 7-0 at Fir Park in October.
Corsie also says the squad have not given up on winning the group, with both sides tied on 15 points apiece, although Iceland have played one game less.
And she says the whole team are determined to win back some pride after watching the Icelandic team's celebrations at the final whistle.
"That shows the respect some of the top nations have for us now," said the 26-year-old.
"It was a sore one, so there'll definitely be an added edge when we go over there.
"Getting beat 4-0 at home is not nice, especially with so much at stake. It would be nice to go there and prove that we are better than we showed."
