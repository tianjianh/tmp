The 29-year-old is available for Saturday's League two match with Hartlepool United at Rodney Parade.
Bird is manager Graham Westley's 12th signing in January as bottom-placed Exiles strive to avoid relegation.
"Ryan has a strong track record in situations like ours and in our league," Westley told the club's website.
"He is both a target man and an able runner, essential ingredients on our pitch."
Newport have also confirmed that Swansea City midfielder Josh Sheehan will remain with the club until the end of the season after his loan deal was extended.
However, midfielder Mark Randall has joined Ben Tozer and Jack Campton in being transfer listed by the Rodney Parade club.
