The wrestler sued Gawker after it published a private video of the star on its website.
David Folkenflik, a media correspondent for US National Public Radio, told the BBC's Today programme how a long-standing animosity might have motivated Mr Thiel.
The lawsuit, he said, appeared designed to take the company down. "This is an existential threat for Gawker," he told Sarah Montague.
