[SN]TITLE[SN]
Colchester United 2-0 Cheltenham Town

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Colchester extended their unbeaten run to seven matches with a 2-0 win over struggling Cheltenham.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Goals from Tom Eastman and Brennan Dickenson lifted Colchester to within two points of the League Two play-offs.
Cheltenham goalkeeper Russell Griffiths twice denied Chris Porter early on, before Colchester made a 10th-minute breakthrough through Eastman, who headed home Owen Garvan's floated free-kick.
Cheltenham had penalty claims rejected midway through the first half after debutant Diego De Girolamo tumbled under Frankie Kent's challenge in the area.
Colchester almost doubled their lead six minutes before half-time when Porter fired straight at Griffiths from a good position.
After De Girolamo twice went close for the visitors after the break, Griffiths brilliantly palmed over Craig Slater's goalbound free-kick while Jordan Cranston hacked Dickenson's off the line.
Colchester keeper Sam Walker made a magnificent save to deny Billy Waters midway through the second half.
Waters fired inches wide for the Robins with 15 minutes remaining but Colchester wrapped up victory with six minutes to go when Dickenson lashed home from just inside the area, after Porter had set him up.
