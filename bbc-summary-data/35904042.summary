Republic of Ireland striker Kevin Doyle said there was "no major damage" after suffering a deep leg gash in Friday's 1-0 win over Switzerland.

The Colorado Rapids striker has had surgery on his leg after he was taken off on a stretcher in the Dublin game.
"Thanks to plastic surgeons at the Mater Hospital, leg looks brand new," said the 32-year-old on Twitter.
Doyle, Daryl Murphy, Robbie Keane and Jon Walters will all miss Tuesday's game against Slovakia in Dublin.
Former Wolves and Reading striker Doyle looked in danger of missing out on Euro 2016 as he was left writhing on the ground in Friday's game after making a block tackle.
However, the striker allayed those fears on Saturday morning, saying he aimed to be "back jogging in a few weeks" after earlier tweeting a picture of his leg.
Keane was ruled out of Friday's win over the Swiss and manager Martin O'Neill said after the game that the squad captain is now "a wee bit concerned about the injury".
"It's something he thought was a kick for a start, he thought it would clear up in a couple of days," said the Republic boss.
"He will miss Tuesday's game definitely now. I am hoping that's not a major concern at the moment and I genuinely don't think it is, so I don't want to start a bit of scaremongering."
Stoke striker Walters will again miss Tuesday's game as he continues to be bothered by a hamstring injury while Daryl Murphy, who replaced Doyle on Friday, has returned to his club Ipswich Town because of a calf strain.
With Doyle's injury not as serious as first feared, O'Neill was reasonably content with a night's work which saw him running the rule over a number of fringe players.
With Shane Duffy impressing in central defence, Shane Long hit the woodwork although the visitors missed late chances with Republic keeper Darren Randolph saving a deflected Granit Xhaka shot.
"We probably lacked a little bit of cohesion, but it was nice to keep the momentum going against what I thought was a very fine Swiss side," said O'Neill.
