The bottles were seized as part of an operation to tackle organised crime within the city's Albanian community, Sussex Police said.
Several premises are being investigated for breaching licence conditions, a spokeswoman added.
Earlier raids also saw eight people charged with drugs offences and 11 people arrested.
Details of the businesses involved have not been released - but police said the pub, two kebab shops, three cafe bars and an off-licence were still being investigated.
They were visited on Thursday by officers from Sussex Police, the Immigration Service, HM Revenue and Customs, and Brighton council licensing, trading standards and environmental health.
