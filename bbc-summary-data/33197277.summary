The pair will be taking over the job from Sarah-Jane Crawford, who only hosted the show for one series.
This year's X Factor will see big changes, with judges Louis Walsh, Mel B and presenter Dermot O'Leary leaving.
Simon Cowell and Cheryl Fernandez-Versini are the only faces returning.
Olly Murs and Caroline Flack have already been named as The X Factor's new presenters.
The judging panel will be completed by newcomers Nick Grimshaw and Rita Ora, who was poached from BBC One's The Voice.
Rochelle's new co-host Melvin Odoom is best known for presenting Kiss FM's breakfast show in London since 2007.
The Xtra Factor is a spin-off show to the main weekend programme, and follows the backstage action, as well as chatting with judges and contestants.
Humes said: "I have watched The Xtra Factor for years so I am beyond excited about joining such a brilliant team and getting to work with my old friend Melvin makes it even better.
"I also can't wait to meet the contestants and be a part of their X Factor experience."
