The 27-year-old, who has not featured since last summer's tour of New Zealand, is set to start on the bench.
Harlequins number eight Nick Easter, 36, returns for the first time since the 2011 World Cup.
Leicester Tigers trio Dan Cole, Tom Croft and Tom Youngs and Saracens prop Mako Vunipola are also named in Stuart Lancaster's 25-man party.
Bath centre Jonathan Joseph returns to the squad for the first time since the 2013 tour to Argentina.
The starting XV is due to be confirmed on Wednesday morning and the two players expected to miss out on the matchday squad of 23 are Bath prop Henry Thomas and Exeter's Jack Nowell.
England have lost six players to injury ahead of Friday's match. with Owen Farrell, David Wilson, Joe Launchbury, Courtney Lawes, Tom Wood and Ben Morgan all unavailable, but head coach Lancaster is happy with the quality of the players he has brought in.
"Everyone named is fit and ready to go and we are looking forward to finalising our preparations over the next few days," he said.
"While we have certain players unavailable through injury, it's great to be able to welcome back guys who missed the autumn internationals, such as Dan Cole, Mako Vunipola and Tom Youngs.
"Their experience, alongside that of players like Tom Croft and Nick Easter, will be invaluable against a strong Welsh team."
England, who beat Wales 29-18 at Twickenham in last year's Six Nations, finished second in the table behind Ireland on points difference.
