[SN]TITLE[SN]
Hertha BSC 3-0 Bor Monchengladbach

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Former Chelsea forward Salomon Kalou scored a hat-trick as Hertha Berlin swept aside Borussia Monchengladbach to go third in the Bundesliga.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Kalou, 31, opened his account for the season after heading home Mitchell Weiser's cross before pouncing on a defensive error to double the lead.
Borussia, held 1-1 by Celtic in the Champions League on Tuesday, had midfielder Christoph Kramer sent off for two yellow cards before half-time.
Kalou's third came after a Weiser pass.
The Ivory Coast international helped Chelsea win four FA Cups, one Premier League title and the Champions League between 2006 and 2012.
Kalou joined Hertha Berlin in 2014 for an undisclosed fee after two years in France with Lille.
Borussia Monchengladbach, who finished fourth in the Bundesliga last season, are in mid-table after failing to win - or score - in their last five league games.
