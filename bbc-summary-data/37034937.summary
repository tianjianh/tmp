A man has appeared in court charged with the attempted burglary of Wayne Rooney's home while he was playing in his testimonial match at Old Trafford.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Robert Leslie McNamara, 24, of Newby Farm Crescent, Scalby, Scarborough, was granted conditional bail at South and East Cheshire Magistrates' Court.
He is alleged to have targeted the footballer's home at about 21:00 BST on 3 August in Prestbury, Cheshire.
The alarm at the ??6m property was reportedly triggered.
Mr McNamara is due to appear at Chester Crown Court on 7 September.
The Rooneys' family home was targeted as the striker, his wife, Coleen, and their three sons, Kai, Klay and Kit, were at the charity tribute game against the Manchester United player's first club, Everton.
The testimonial, which ended 0-0, made history as it was the first game between Premier League teams to be streamed live on Facebook.
