The man, said to be in his 60s, slammed the swan into a harbour wall in the Cornish fishing village of Mevagissey according to witnesses.
The swan, known as Nobby and much loved in the village, was left bleeding and battered after the attack on Tuesday.
Police are investigating the offence and "exploring the possibility" the attacker was a German holidaymaker.
Debs Johnston, who regularly feeds the swans, said: "This guy apparently just grabbed him by the neck and was slamming him into the wall."
Miss Johnston went with an RSPCA officer to find Nobby at the nearby beach of Pentewan on Wednesday where they found he was missing all of his flight feathers.
A witness, who did not want to be named, said the man thought to have carried out the attack then got on to a German tour coach.
Devon and Cornwall Police said they wanted to speak to a man in his 60s, around 5ft 8in tall, wearing cream trousers and a red and orange top, in connection with causing unnecessary suffering to an animal.
A spokesman said: "We received a report of a male offender who seemed to grab an adult swan by the neck and swing it around then throw it to the ground, resulting in injury to the swan's wing.
"This was a cruel offence which has caused unnecessary suffering to the swan."
