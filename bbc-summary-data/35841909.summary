The vehicle smashed into the house in West Pennard, near Glastonbury, Somerset, after colliding with an articulated lorry on the A361.
The homeowner, who was at his desk at the time of the crash on Friday morning, suffered minor injuries and was taken to hospital.
Crews are working to remove the truck and stabilise the building.
Devon and Somerset Fire and Rescue Service said three vehicles - an articulated lorry, taxi and tipper truck -were involved.
A spokesman said two gas cylinders had been damaged in the incident and a 50m cordon had been set up.
"An urban search and rescue module has been mobilised from Exeter to stabilise the building and a structural engineer has been requested from the local authority," he said.
The A361 is currently closed in both directions.
