Lyle Bailey: NI agency behind controversial adverts ceases trading

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The advertising agency behind some of Northern Ireland's most memorable ad campaigns has ceased trading.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The closure of Lyle Bailie International will result in the loss of six jobs.
It said a major factor has been the downturn in government advertising spending.
In an early guise as McCann-Erickson Belfast, the firm produced government advertising aimed at building support for the peace process.
One of the firm's ads was so shocking it was banned from being broadcast before the watershed.
Another campaign, 'crashed lives' featured real victims.
One such advert showed disturbing images of gunmen opening fire on customers in a pub.
Lyle Bailie was established in 2004 following the management buyout of McCann Erickson Belfast by directors David Lyle and Julie Anne Bailie.
Mr Lyle said there have been "ever-reducing budgets amid growing uncertainty about the future".
He added the failure of the Northern Ireland Executive to agree a budget has "been a major factor in this uncertainty".
Mr Lyle thanked his clients and staff who he said had shown  unwavering commitment "in the face of these recent financial difficulties".
The company has appointed Baker Tilly Mooney Moore accountants to propose an arrangement with creditors.
