Hull City Council: Further savings attack 'most vulnerable'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A new round of council savings in Hull is an attack on the city's "most vulnerable", a councillor has said.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Labour-led city council is looking to save a further Â£2.2m in its budget by 2020, after an Â£8m cut was sent out to consultation in July.
Lib Dem councillor Adam Williams said the move would lead to "further cuts to services people rely on".
The Labour group said it was making "difficult decisions on the back of a very tough funding position".
The fresh round of cuts will be considered by the authority's cabinet on 22 August.
Services where savings are being sought include children's centres, provisions to homelessness organisations, bus routes and recycling centres.
Mr Williams said: "These services are the things that the most vulnerable people in Hull rely on on a daily basis.
"It's just the wrong thing to be doing."
Labour councillor Daren Hale, deputy leader of the council, said: "We are continuing to have to make difficult decisions on the back of a very tough funding position.
"We will continue to plan and budget as best we can to maintain vital services, but with the relentless cuts in government funding we cannot avoid the prospect of some reductions in service."
The authority said it had lost about Â£104m and shed more than 2,000 jobs since 2011 due to cuts from central government.
