Lews Castle Grounds in Stornoway and Dean Castle Park in Kilmarnock have been awarded grants.
It is hoped the restoration of historic Lews Castle Grounds will encourage more people to use the park.
A new space for outdoor theatre, music and crafts is planned at Dean Castle Park, with gardens being restored and the visitor centre improved.
Iain Maciver, of the Stornoway Trust, said of the Lews funding: "This exciting news offers the trust an opportunity to manage the restoration and regeneration of an outstanding asset.
"We are indebted to HLF for allowing us to further progress our vision for the revitalisation of our wonderful legacy."
Douglas Reid, leader of East Ayrshire Council, said: "This is incredible news for Dean Castle Country Park, a place that is hugely important to the people of Kilmarnock and beyond, and we all wish to see it protected and enhanced for the benefit and enjoyment of future generations.
"We are delighted with this grant which will enable us to enhance the visitor experience and make it a destination that people of all ages can enjoy in all weathers, all year round."
Colin McLean, head of HLF in Scotland, said: "Using funds raised through the National Lottery, HLF is able to protect these precious places helping make a difference to the quality of life for millions of Scots."
