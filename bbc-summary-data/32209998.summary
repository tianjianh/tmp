Home care firm has contracts axed by two councils

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A firm responsible for providing home care for hundreds of people has had its contract cancelled by two councils, BBC Wales has learned.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Alpha Home Care was responsible for 266 people in Powys and 78 people in Neath Port Talbot.
Both councils have axed the firm, which received two critical reports from Care and Social Services Inspectorate Wales (CSSIW), and it is understood Swansea council is set to follow.
Alpha Home Care declined to comment.
Neath Port Talbot council has also terminated the contract of Alpha's sister company Bryce Care.
The most recent CSSIW report in February highlighted six breaches of care regulations.
In April 2014, Alpha Home Care was one of four companies awarded a contract to provide home care to vulnerable people in Powys.
Last September, another of those companies, Reach, ended its contract just before a scathing report was published into the care it delivered.
Although Alpha Care's service in Neath Port Talbot and Swansea was praised by CSSIW, Neath Port Talbot said they'd ended the contract because of concerns about the company's financial stability as a result of the Powys contract being terminated.
A Powys council spokesman said: "Senior care managers are already working closely with Alpha Home Care to transfer staff to the council and other providers to ensure consistency of service is maintained."
It said it was working hard to iron out any glitches that occur as a result of the transfer as quickly as possible.
Swansea council said it had not yet cancelled its contract and the situation was under review.
All three local authorities said the well-being and safety of clients was their top priority.
