Johnny Depp 'abuse' hearing put back two days

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A court hearing over Amber Heard's allegations that Johnny Depp physically abused her has been put back.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A Los Angeles judge ruled the hearing would begin on 17 August, two days later than planned, after concluding it might take up to five days.
Heard filed to divorce Depp on 23 May. A few days later, the actress obtained a temporary restraining order after accusing him of hitting her repeatedly.
If she prevails, the restraining order could be extended for up to five years.
Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Carl H Moor ruled on Tuesday that Heard should sit for a deposition on Friday and Depp give sworn testimony on Saturday.
The judge ruled that Depp - who has denied the abuse allegations through his lawyer - would not be allowed to attend Heard's deposition.
Depp, 53, met Heard, 30, while they were co-starring in 2011 film The Rum Diary and the couple were married in February 2015.
Depp was ordered not to contact Heard, and stay 100 yards away from her, after she accused him of striking her and throwing a mobile phone during a fight in May this year.
