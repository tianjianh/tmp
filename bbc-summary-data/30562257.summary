After a tough duel, jockey Daryl Jacob got the 13-2 shot, trained by Nick Williams, up to beat the horse he rode to victory in the 2011 Triumph Hurdle.
In the following race, favourite The Young Master scored in his first outing since a disqualification at Wincanton.
Davy Condon took the Ladbroke Hurdle aboard Bayan but was given a 15-day ban for breaking the whip rules.
The jockey,  who was also fined £3,150,  has only recently returned after a fall which nearly ended his career.
At Haydock, the David Pipe-trained Broadway Buffalo (5-1)  won the Tommy Whittle Chase under Conor O'Farrell, finishing four lengths clear of runner-up Toby Lerone.
Reve De Sivola was clocking up the sixth Grade One victory of his career and emulating Big Buck's who won the race three years running from 2009 to 2011.
"It's the biggest winner I've had since Cheltenham and this is a dream," said Jacob, who was replaced as trainer Paul Nicholls' number one jockey by Sam Twiston-Davies in April.
The Young Master looks bound for the Cheltenham Festival in March, with the RSA Chase an option.
Trainer Neil Mulholland saw his horse disqualified after winning the Badger Ales Trophy for not meeting entry requirements.
Despite being raised 14lb in the weights by the handicapper, he took the £100,000 Mappin & Webb Silver Cup Handicap Chase by two-and-half lengths from Houblon Des Obeaux.
Bayan (14-1) gave Irish trainer Elliott his second win in three years having succeeded with Cause Of Causes in 2012.
Condon saw off Pine Creek by a neck to the delight of the horse's owners, who include At The Races broadcaster Gary O'Brien.
In Ireland, Un De Sceaux won by 12 lengths at Fairyhouse and was cut to 3-1 (from 4s) by bookmakers for the Arkle Chase at Cheltenham.
