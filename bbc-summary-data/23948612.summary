[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Natalie Putt left her home in Thornleigh, Lower Gornal, on 1 September 2003, leaving her 11-week-old son at the house with relatives.
It was the last time anyone reported seeing the 17-year-old.
West Midlands Police said the case remained open and any credible information would be investigated.
Det Sgt Matt Morgan said: "It remains a missing persons' inquiry as there is no evidence she's been murdered and certainly nothing to suggest she was suicidal at the time she vanished."
Natalie had been out with a friend the day before she went missing.
An 18-year-old man was arrested in 2004 in connection with her disappearance but was later released without charge.
Police sealed off private land in Wombourne, south Staffordshire, earlier this year after someone recalled seeing a man digging near stables where Natalie is understood to have kept horses.
Det Sgt Morgan said: "Forensics teams carried out extensive searches and archaeologists used specialist radar equipment to reveal any buried items, or [reveal] whether land had been disturbed.
"Nothing suspicious was uncovered though and the search was called off after three days."
Natalie was described as white, of slim build, and just over 5ft (1.5m) tall  She was wearing a pendant necklace with the words "someone special" engraved on it.
