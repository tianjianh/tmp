Three Scottish wildcat kittens bred at the Highland Wildlife Park near Aviemore have gone on display.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The rare native species is under threat of extinction due to cross breeding with feral and domestic cats and habitat loss.
The three kittens, born at the end of April, are part of a conservation breeding programme.
It aims to build up a sustainable population to boost the long-term prospects for the species.
Captive breeding forms part of the Scottish Wildcat Conservation Action Plan unveiled in September 2013.
Scottish Natural Heritage and the Royal Zoological Society of Scotland said it was necessary to conserve the cats.
They are among 30 organisations backing the action plan.
However, the project has been criticised by the Captive Animals' Protection Society.
It instead supports the use of the the Wildcat Haven, a 500 square mile area that covers parts of the Ardnamurchan and Morvern peninsulas.
