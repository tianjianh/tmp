The singer could not attend the ceremony, but sent a message saying: "That's amazing. I've only just put out new music. I'm so chuffed."
Irish singer Hozier won song of the year for the dramatic ballad Take Me To Church - the show's only public vote.
And One Direction opened the show, in one of their last public performances before taking a year-long hiatus.
Surrounded by pyrotechnics, the four-piece played their number one hit Drag Me Down, to huge screams from the audience.
Earlier, the band had braved torrential rain outside Birmingham's Genting Arena to pose for photos with fans.
Asked by host Chris Evans if they were really taking a career break at the height of their success, Liam Payne replied: "It sounds like a stupid plan but, yes, it's true."
Other performers included Ellie Goulding, who played a sweeping, orchestral version of her 50 Shades Of Grey theme Love Me Like You Do, backed by the BBC Concert Orchestra.
Little Mix played their hit single Black Magic, while country duo The Shires performed a special duet with former beautiful South stars Paul Heaton and Jacqui Abbot, including the songs The Austerity of Love, Nashville Grey Skies and Leaving on a Jet Plane.
And Rod Stewart closed the show with the songs Please and Sailing.
Taylor Swift won the best international artist prize - accepting her trophy, a golden vintage BBC microphone via a video from Australia.
"Oh my God, this is really heavy," said the star. "I really appreciate you guys shipping this out, because it must have cost a lot."
Hozier also commented on the hefty trophy, joking: "You could kill a man with it. I think they're going to put it in the new edition of Cluedo."
The singer, whose 1989 world tour has been one of 2015's top earners, added that playing Radio 1's Big Weekend in Norwich had been "an amazing highlight of my year".
And Jack Garratt picked up the BBC Introducing Award, recognising a newcomer who has risen through the ranks of the BBC's new music strand.
"It's a weird feeling being validated for potential," he said. "A lot of these things are saying, 'you might be good next year' which is an incredible compliment to receive - but there's a certain pressure to it."
But the evening really belonged to Adele, whose new album 25 has become the year's biggest seller on both sides of the Atlantic after just three weeks on sale.
"Sorry I'm not there," said the star in her video message. "I'm absolutely gutted but thanks so much for my award. I hope you're all having a wonderful evening."
Other acts appeared to be in awe of the singer.
"She stepped into 2015 near the end and smashed everything out of the park," James Bay told the BBC. "She's an incredible artist so it's well deserved."
"You can't touch Adele," said Little Mix star Perrie Edwards.
"She will always be at the top, just sitting there comfortably," added Leigh-Anne Pinnock.  "No-one will ever touch her."
Live coverage of the ceremony and the TV broadcast is continuing on BBC Music's dedicated live page.
