Mansfield Town boss Adam Murray says his side are feeling confident ahead of Saturday's derby against Notts County despite their recent results.

The Stags started the season well but are without a win in their last six league matches.
Murray told BBC Radio Nottingham: "The performance levels have been really high. We haven't taken our chances and have been sucker-punched.
"We've kept our head down and kept working hard. The boys are confident."
This month some of our fans would probably chuck me out of a window
Mansfield enjoyed a morale-boosting victory on Tuesday, beating League One side Port Vale in the EFL Trophy.
"We feel like we've brushed some things out the door and got some things back on track," said Murray. "All that's been missing over this last month is belief and confidence.
"This time last month I was nominated for manager of the month. I think this month some of our fans would probably chuck me out of a window, but that's the game.
"We just need to keep doing what we're doing and, the way this game goes, Lady Luck will again spring back around.
"Our focus now is on a massive game on Saturday. The boys have been preparing and we're ready for action. We want to put in a good performance."
Notts County, seventh in League Two, will be out for revenge at Field Mill, where they were thrashed 5-0 last season.
They will also be looking for a fourth consecutive away win under John Sheridan.
The former Sheffield Wednesday midfielder took over as Magpies manager during the summer and is confident they will fare better in the Nottinghamshire showdown this time around.
If it is a battle then I've got players I think can stand up to it
"It's one of those games that's about winning the game, no matter how you win," said Sheridan.
"We'll try to play. We don't want to get caught up in a battle, but sometimes when it's an ugly game you've got to deal with that.
"It'll be a good atmosphere and we'll take a big following. When you're a player you want to play in this sort of game.
"With it being Mansfield there's a bit more of an edge to it, but we've just got to treat it like another game.
"If it is a battle then I've got players I think can stand up to it. Whatever is thrown at us I think we can deal with."
