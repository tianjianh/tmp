Britain's Liam Smith has asked for "respect" from the judges in his fight with Saul 'Canelo' Alvarez of Mexico as both men weighed in right on the 11-stone light middleweight limit.

Alvarez has been tipped to take the WBO belt from the unbeaten world champion when they meet in Texas on Saturday.
But if the contest goes to points, Smith said: "If I win the fight then make sure I get the decision.
"Give me the respect I deserve. I'm the champion, even though I am the B-side."
He added: "Canelo's the big name. It's Mexican Independence Day, so I know that. But I hope they'll respect that I'm champion and be fair."
Liverpudlian Smith is unbeaten in 24 contests and won the WBO belt when he defeated USA fighter John Thompson in Manchester last October.
Alvarez, who knocked out Briton Amir Khan in his last fight in May, has lost just one of 49 pro bouts, to Floyd Mayweather on points in 2013.
However, the Mexican vacated the WBC belt he retained against Khan to delay negotiations with the camp of WBA and IBF champion Gennady Golovkin.
The fight, which is scheduled for late Saturday night or early Sunday morning BST, will take place in front of 60,000 at the Dallas Cowboys stadium in Fort Worth and Smith believes victory over Alvarez will make his name in world boxing.
"I'm not in a situation where I have nothing to lose in this fight. I've got a title to lose," Smith added.
"I've taken this fight because it's an opportunity to make a name for myself and establish myself as one of the best pound-for-pound fighters in the world."
