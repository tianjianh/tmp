Burns became Scotland's first three-weight world champion when he stopped Italy's Michele Di Rocco in May.
Belarussian Relikh, 26, is unbeaten, boasting 19 knockouts from 21 fights.
"Relikh's a very tough first defence. He's got a high KO ratio so he'll be very dangerous. Trust me, he has my undivided attention," Burns said.
"There are some massive fights out there against some huge names in the 140lbs division - but we're taking it one step at a time."
Former two-weight world champion Hatton says Relikh will not be fazed by going into the bout as the underdog.
"Kiryl is one of those cool, unflinching boxers," said Hatton. "This is a big opportunity for him and he's not bothered about being the underdog.
"He's been training and boxing away from home for years so he'll have no problem going to Scotland. Having the crowd against him will bring the best out of him.
"Ricky Burns is a top-class fighter, but there always has to be a changing of the guard and I think this could be Kiryl's time."
Charlie Flynn and Joe Ham, who represented Scotland at the 2014 Commonwealth Games in Glasgow, will both fight on the undercard.
