iRobot sues Hoover and Black & Decker over robo-vacuums

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Robotic vacuums specialist iRobot is suing Hoover and Black & Decker among others over claims they used its technologies without permission.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Massachusetts-based company cites a variety of patents in its legal filings, including misuse of its obstacle-detection system, brush designs and navigation controls.
It is seeking financial compensation and the right to block further use of its tech.
The accused have yet to respond.
iRobot began selling robot vacuums under the Roomba brand in 2002 and says it has sold more than 15 million units to date.
"The filing of this litigation signals our commitment to protecting our investments," a spokesman said.
"iRobot will not stand by while others offer products that infringe on our intellectual property."
Hoover launched its first robo-vacuum - the Quest 1000 - last year, while Black & Decker only unveiled its Smartech robot range at the CES trade show in January, and has yet to put them on sale.
Others being sued include:
This is not the first time iRobot has gone to the courts over an intellectual property dispute.
It sued four German companies over related claims in 2013.
Prior to that it sued Robotic FX over allegations the military robotic specialist had stolen trade secrets, which led the Chicago-based company to dissolve in 2007.
