The 55-year-old signed a three-year deal at The Valley on Monday.
Director Richard Murray said owner Roland Duchatelet had "underestimated" the Championship, from which the Addicks were relegated in April.
"It is not easy to say you have made mistakes. The important thing is we learn from those going forward," Slade told BBC Radio London.
Charlton appointed three different head coaches as they dropped back into League One for the first time since 2011-12, with Jose Riga resigning following the last game of the season on 7 May.
Duchatelet has made six managerial changes since taking over the south-east London club in January 2014, with former Brighton, Leyton Orient and Cardiff boss Slade becoming the first British boss to be appointed by the Belgian businessman.
"There was a willingness to put things right and move the club forward and I was quite excited by that," Slade added.
"They have made a start by appointing a British manager - somebody that knows the league and their way around.
"The fact I know a lot of people - players and managers - will help the club."
Slade believes he is capable of repairing the relationship between the club and its fans, which has become increasingly strained since the turn of the year.
Charlton fans staged a series of protests aimed at Duchatelet and chief executive Katrien Meire in the second half of the 2015-16 season and supporters formed a campaign group called Coalition Against Roland Duchatelet (CARD), with the ultimate aim of getting Duchatelet to sell the club.
However, Slade admits that an improvement in the atmosphere at The Valley "is not going to happen overnight".
He said: "We have to make good choices, even when they are small choices, to show the fans we are reconnecting and there is trust going forward.
"I like openness and honesty and that is what I will try to portray to the fans. We need to get that identity back as a community club and a togetherness. We need to all be pulling in the same direction.
"There is opposition at the minute but hopefully I can put that right on the pitch and give the fans something to be proud of."
