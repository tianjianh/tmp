London Irish: Topsy Ojo staying focused with Championship promotion in balance

An immediate return to top-flight rugby union for London Irish would "right some of the wrongs" of relegation, according to winger Topsy Ojo.

Ojo, 31, was among those to feel the pain of the drop as the club finished bottom of the Premiership last season.
Despite looking set to finish the regular season with a 100% record, The Exiles will still have to negotiate May's Championship promotion play-offs.
"We're completely focused on trying to secure our goal," Ojo told BBC Sport.
With four league games remaining, Irish have won 16 from 16 in the Championship ahead of the visit of play-off chasing Cornish Pirates on Saturday.
But nothing is being taken for granted among the squad as they chase a potential Championship promotion and British & Irish Cup double.
"It's about just doing what we've done throughout the season," the former England international said.
"We don't want to get to the end of the season and have to revamp everything.
"The thinking in pre-season was about building a game plan and a structure that works for us, one that we know if we execute as well as possible, more often than not we would be on the right side of results."
Ojo, who joined Irish's academy in 2003 before his senior debut two years later, knows more than most the significance of regaining the club's Premiership status at the first attempt.
"It would be huge," he said. "It would right some of the wrongs of last season, a lot of the pain and hurt.
"It would give the club an opportunity to grow and get back to the ambitions we set out 18 months ago when we were looking at our five-year plan and beyond.
"That's still on the table, but it allows us to push on with it."
