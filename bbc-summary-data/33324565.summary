Melissa Morton, 12, was among 34 pupils from an Essex school involved in the motorway crash on Sunday.
She managed to get out of the coach quickly but said "petrol was leaking, and there was loads of blood all over the floor, and people were screaming".
Driver James Chance, who worked for a coach firm in Lisburn, County Antrim, was killed in the crash.
The pupils, from Brentwood School, were taken to Belgian hospitals. One of them, aged 13, was treated in intensive care after suffering a head injury.
Head teacher Ian Davies tweeted to say they were "in good spirits and looking forward to returning home later this week".
Investigations are ongoing into the cause of the crash. Witnesses said the vehicle hit a bridge on the A18 (E40) near Middelkerke, West Flanders.
Melissa said she was sitting towards the back of the coach when it "started to go off the road" before it "went into this massive bridge pillar which I didn't see coming".
"It didn't feel real at all. I thought I was dreaming," Melissa said.
"I didn't know what was happening at the time. I was scared and wanted my dad, and my mum."
She managed to call her father, Keith Morton, 45, who headed to Belgium from the family home in Highwood, near Chelmsford.
"Normally I keep quite calm, but I felt I had to get there as quickly as possible. She just was crying and saying help me now, get here. So I jumped in the car," he said.
Melissa, who was left with facial and abdominal bruising, said she was getting flashbacks which made her cry.
"I wouldn't go on a coach again, or a school trip," she said. "It's put me off completely."
