Kinect engineers compete for investment at Microsoft Accelerator

Microsoft has tried to fast-track business software for its Kinect sensor by acting as a matchmaker for promising start-ups and investors.

It helped 11 firms develop products over three months, then presented them to an audience of venture capitalists and other potential backers.
Projects included a tool to help stroke patients regain movement and a way to make any surface a touch interface.
Kinect has been a hit on the Xbox, but competes against other devices on PCs.
The motion and sound sensor was originally released on the games console in November 2010. A more expensive model designed for Windows-based PCs followed earlier this year.
More than 500 start-ups competed for a place in Microsoft's Accelerator programme. The selected 11 were each given $20,000 (Â£12,815) in seed funding, offered access to the company's technology and given business and engineering advice by its employees at its Seattle headquarters.
The scheme climaxed on Thursday when investors were invited to see each company demonstrate their invention.
Participants included:
One user-interface expert told the BBC that investors were traditionally cautious of such innovative ideas.
"There are a lot of potential uses for immersive technologies like Kinect both from businesses wanting to analyse their customers' behaviour to consumers being able to get different types of feedback from their actions," said Brian Blau, research director in consumer technologies at Gartner.
"Up until now most work done with the device outside the Xbox has been limited to experiments. What these companies are trying to do is hard and brand new, and that can make it hard to attract funding when they have still to prove they can add business value."
Microsoft may also be mindful that other companies - like SoftKinetic and Leap Motion - have developed more accurate motion-tracking system.
"The issue Microsoft has to face is that other sensor makers are doing deals with TV and PC-makers to embed their products in future devices," Mr Blau added.
"But schemes like this should help keep the Kinect at the forefront of developer's minds."
With its involvement in the first Accelerator programme now over, Microsoft is accepting applicants for a follow-up scheme ahead of a 13 July deadline.
