The witness told the Rotherham child sexual abuse trial she had gone to live with Karen MacGregor in the 1980s, along with other girls who had been treated "like slaves".
Ms MacGregor is accused of making young girls available for sex with older men.
She and six other defendants deny 60 charges over a 10-year period.
The woman, now aged 43, said Ms Macgregor's house was "often full of Pakistani men".
In a police interview played to the court, she described how Ms MacGregor, now 58, took her upstairs one night with an Asian man after she had been drinking vodka.
The woman said she passed out and woke to find a man sexually assaulting her.
She said she shouted loudly and the man ran off, but nobody came to help.
"I thought she was my second mother but it turned out I was totally wrong," the witness said to officers.
"She must have known. Why didn't she come upstairs?"
Arshid Hussain, 40, High Street, East Cowick, Goole, faces 30 charges, including five counts of rape.
Qurban Ali, 53, Clough Road, Rotherham, faces four charges, including rape and conspiracy to rape.
Majid Bostan, 37, Ledsham Road, Rotherham faces one charge of indecent assault.
Sajid Bostan, 38,  Broom Avenue, Rotherham faces seven charges, including four counts of rape,.
Basharat Hussain, 39, of no fixed abode, faces 16 charges including two counts of rape.
Karen MacGregor, 58,  Barnsley Road, Wath, South Yorkshire, faces three charges, including conspiracy to rape.
Shelley Davies, 40, Wainwright Road, Kimberworth Park, Rotherham, faces three charges, including conspiracy to rape.
The woman and other girls were made to do housework all the time at Ms MacGregor's home, and the door was locked so they could not leave, the court heard.
"All she wanted us to do was clean," she said.
"We were on our hands and knees all the time scrubbing carpets, settee, washing curtains, washing windows, stairs, changing bedding all the time.
"We were like slaves all the time."
Twelve girls in Rotherham were repeatedly raped, beaten, passed between abusers and used as prostitutes, the court previously heard.
Prosecutors told Sheffield Crown Court the girls were sexually abused from as young as 12, with some becoming pregnant.
The trial continues.
