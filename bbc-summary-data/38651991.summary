The France international, 33, made the remark after his side's 2-1 Premier League win over Burnley on 2 January.
City were reduced to 10 men in the 32nd minute of the match, when referee Lee Mason sent off midfielder Fernandinho.
The FA said the post, which was later deleted, "questioned the integrity of the match official".
Sagna has also been warned about his future conduct.
City have not ruled out the possibility of appealing against the severity of the fine.
