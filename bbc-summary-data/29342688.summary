Skilled manual workers represented just 24% of the population aged 16-64.
Small employers and the self-employed accounted for 295,000 people - 7% of the population aged between 16 and 74.
Men were most likely to be self-employed (11%), compared to 4% for women.
In 2011, over one quarter (27%) of the 4m people aged 16 to 74 in Scotland held a degree, compared to the 23% with no qualifications.
Among the other findings are that among the Asian population 21% worked in retail activities with a further 20% in food services.
White people were more likely (16%) to work in manufacturing and construction than those from minority ethnic groups (6%).
