Silva defeated world number one Sumiya Dorjsuren of Mongolia by Waza-ari to delight a partisan crowd at Carioca 2.
The gold medal marks a fairytale rise to Olympic triumph from a childhood in Rio's notorious 'City of God' favela for Silva.
"Judo is my life," said Silva. "I love competing at home, because of the fans. Their cheering helps a lot."
And she added: "I hope that this medal opened doors for more medals this week."
Silva qualified for the London 2012 Games but was disqualified in the early rounds for a rule violation.
London champion Kaori Matsumoto of Japan took bronze alongside five-time European champion Telma Monteiro of Portugal.
