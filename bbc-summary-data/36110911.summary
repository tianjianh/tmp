[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Half-centuries from Gary Ballance and Jack Leaning rescued Yorkshire on a rain interrupted first day against Warwickshire at Edgbaston.

Yorkshire slumped to 85-4, as Alex Lees and Adam Lyth both fell for 19 before Andrew Gale was bowled by Keith Barker.
Jonny Bairstow, who hit 246 against Hampshire last week, then chopped on off Chris Woakes for 20.
But Ballance and Leaning's unbroken 92-run fifth-wicket stand steadied the innings as Yorkshire closed on 177-4.
The visitors' top order failed to fire once more, having collapsed in both innings in their first match of the season against Hampshire, as they went from 46-0 to 56-3.
Rikki Clarke bowled Lees, and Lyth was caught in the slips off Boyd Rankin as the openers struggled with Warwickshire's seamers.
Despite their innings being interrupted by rain and bad light, England hopeful Ballance, and Leaning, both hit seven fours to reach the close of play on 50 not out each, and leave Yorkshire in a healthier position.
Warwickshire all-rounder Chris Woakes:
"It was a pretty good day for us but, having had them 80-odd for four we'd have liked them five or six down by this point. But they won the toss and batted on a pretty good pitch so we can't really moan.
"Credit to Gary Ballance and Jack Leaning for the way they batted. They got stuck in. We bowled well and put the ball in the right areas but they responded and sometimes you just have to give credit where it's due.
"I feel fine. Last week I fell at the Ageas Bowl and aggravated something in the back of my knee but I had an injection in it and it has settled down nicely. I felt in good rhythm, hit the pitch pretty hard and was pleased with the way it came out."
Yorkshire coach Jason Gillespie:
"Gary Ballance played really well. He stuck to his zones and how he plays and absorbed some very good bowling. He is a fine player.
"Personally, I didn't agree with England's decision to leave him out last year but his reaction to that has been outstanding. He has knuckled down for Yorkshire.
"Joe Root will come back into the side next week so it will be an interesting selection decision we have to make, but we are not worrying about that at the moment."
