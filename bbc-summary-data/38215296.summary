The Tigers are 19th in the table after Monday's 1-0 defeat at Middlesbrough.
They had only 13 senior players available on the opening day of the season, and signed six in the last two days of the summer transfer window.
"Our signings have done their bit but they were last minute," said Davies. "I don't believe the manager had time to explore all of his options."
Mike Phelan succeeded Steve Bruce as Hull boss in July but was only given the job on a permanent basis in October.
The Tigers have scored only 11 league goals this season, fewer than any other team in the top flight.
"We need someone who can put the ball in the net," added Davies.
In a dour affair at the Riverside that was settled by a Gaston Ramirez header, Phelan's side did not seriously threaten the home goal until injury time.
"Our first shot on target was in the 92nd minute and that is not good enough," said Davies, who described his side as "gutless" and "embarrassing" after a 6-1 defeat at Bournemouth in October.
Hull, who have lost eight of their past 10 league games, were without six injured players and the suspended Dieumerci Mbokani for the trip to Boro.
"Hopefully come January we will look different," said Phelan.
"We need that investment. We can't afford any more injuries, it is going to be a hard slog throughout Christmas."
