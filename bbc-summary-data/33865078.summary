[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Alec Warburton, 59, has not been seen since 31 July.
South Wales Police want to speak to his lodger, David Craig Ellis, who they think may have information about his disappearance.
On Tuesday, Det Supt Paul Hurley made a direct appeal to Mr Ellis to get in touch.
Mr Warburton was reported missing from his home in Vivian Road, Sketty, just after midday on 2 August.
Officers have been searching in and around the home, where Mr Ellis also lived, and a police tent was put up on the street last Thursday.
Police are also trying to locate his green Peugeot 205.
A CCTV image of the car, registration M805 HFJ, has been released by officers in the hope somebody will recall seeing it.
Det Supt Hurley said: "This car was driven to north Wales on Saturday 1st August and we want to hear from anyone who may have seen it or David Ellis at any time between 2pm and midnight that day between Caersws and Betws y Coed.
"The car was returned to Swansea during the following morning. We know it was used in the Swansea area until 4th August and it has not been located since."
In a direct appeal to the tenant, he added: "We want to find out what has happened to Alec Warburton. I believe that you have valuable information which will help us in our inquiries."
