The last meeting between the teams took place at Wembley Stadium in November 2013 when Arsenal defender Per Mertesacker gave the Germans a 1-0 win.
This will be England's first fixture in Berlin since 2008 when goals from Matthew Upson and John Terry gave the visitors victory.
March's fixture will form part of England's preparations for Euro 2016.
The national team have a maximum 18 points in qualifying Group E, and could seal their spot at the tournament in September when they take on San Marino and Switzerland.
