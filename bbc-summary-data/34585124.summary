Son killed mother after drugs row in Barnstaple

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A son has been jailed for life for killing his mother who he blamed for squandering a £75,000 inheritance.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Charles Davison, 39, punched Valerie Davison in the head and body and stabbed her in the neck with a knife.
Exeter Crown Court heard the 59-year-old was killed during an argument about drugs and money and her body was not found for two weeks.
Davison, of Barnstaple, Devon, denied murder until the seventh day of his trial when he changed his plea.
He left her body on a sofa under a blanket in her flat where it was found by a care worker.
Davison told police there had been tension between the pair because his mother had inherited £75,000 from her adoptive father and spent it all in a few months.
After killing her in November last year, Davison travelled to London where he was sectioned under the Mental Health Act after making a hoax bomb call at Cannon Street Railway Station, the court heard.
He was taken back to North Devon where he was receiving treatment at the time his mother's body was found.
He told police the dead woman was a Russian spy who had entered the country to replace his mother and who had been plotting against the Queen.
After further psychiatric treatment he admitted assaulting her in a row over missing heroin but continued to deny the stabbing and insisted the victim was not his mother.
He was jailed for life with a minimum term of 19 years by Judge Francis Gilbert, QC, who told him the killing had been deliberate but not pre-meditated.
He said: "There was no reason for attacking her other than that you were angry and lost your temper because she had consumed what you considered to be your heroin, leaving none for you.
"I have read two psychiatric reports which conclude you were suffering from schizophrenia which lowered your degree of culpability."
Sally Howes, QC, defending, said he was "not himself" at the time of the killing and clearly in need of psychiatric help.
