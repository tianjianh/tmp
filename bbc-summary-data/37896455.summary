[SN]TITLE[SN]
England U21 3-2 Italy U21

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Jack Stephens scored a winner with the last kick of the game as England Under-21s extended their unbeaten run to 15 games by beating Italy.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Southampton defender Stephens smashed in on his home ground to bring up a 27th home win in a row for Aidy Boothroyd's side.
England had not beaten Italy at this level since 1997 but were deserved winners in an entertaining game.
Leicester's Demarai Gray and Chelsea midfielder Lewis Baker also scored.
England's last defeat came against Italy in June 2015, which ended their European Championship campaign.
Both sides have qualified for the U21 Euro 2017 tournament, which will be held in Poland next summer.
England took the lead when John Swift's cut back was stabbed clear but only to Gray, who side-footed home.
Italy levelled when Swift gave the ball away, Andrea Conti ran at Brendan Galloway and his cross was deflected up over Angus Gunn and in.
Federico di Francesco then tapped Italy ahead from a corner before Baker hit a low equaliser after a one-two with Will Hughes.
And in stoppage time Stephens converted after Calum Chambers' header was pushed out.
Interim England Under-21 manager Aidy Boothroyd:
"We have managed to qualify six times on the spin, what we have to do now is do as well at the tournament. That's the holy grail, isn't it?
"If we can do that then we will be in a good place.
"We learnt a lot about ourselves. We learnt we have plenty of character and can score goals from all over the pitch. We hit the crossbar and the post and we had an appeal for a penalty we thought we should have had (when Demarai Gray went down in the first half).
"I'm not saying it was all rosy because it wasn't; we showed there are a lot of things we still need to work on defensively, but overall we are delighted to play such a major nation and get a result like that."
