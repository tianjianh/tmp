New Spanish golfing sensation Jon Rahm is set to play at the Irish Open in Portstewart from 6-9 July.

Rahm, 22, has made a major impact since turning professional after enjoying a distinguished career as an amateur.
The Spaniard has moved up to 13 in the world rankings in the wake of a win at the Farmers Insurance Open in January, followed by four more top-10 finishes in consecutive PGA Tour tournaments.
Rahm will also play in the Scottish Open and the Open Championship in July.
News of his proposed participation at Portstewart was reported in the Spanish Ten-Golf website.
His presence at Portstewart in July will come as a major boost to the event, and provide him with some practice in playing links golf before heading to Royal Birkdale for the third major of the year.
For Rahm, it will be his first European Tour event since turning professional last year, although he did play in the Open at Royal Troon in 2016.
He played in the same group as Northern Ireland's Rory McIlroy for the first two rounds of the Masters at Augusta last week and ended in a tie for 27th position.
The Barrika golfer's next tournament will be the Players' Championship at Sawgrass, the PGA Tour's flagship event, in mid-May.
His achievements in the amateur game include being the only two-time winner of the Ben Hogan Award in 2015 and 2016, an award that recognises the outstanding male amateur and collegiate golfer of the year.
