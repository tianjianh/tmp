Three-year delay fears for Highland mental health checks

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
People in the Highlands requiring mental health care have been waiting up to three-and-a-half years for an assessment, it has been claimed.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Highland Council said it has had to prioritise cases because of increasing demands on services.
But the Highland Users support Group (HUG) said the delay was unacceptable.
A report on the matter will be presented to councillors at a meeting on Thursday.
Highland Council is responsible for providing officers to assess and assist local people suffering from mental illnesses, many of whom are incapacitated and have learning disabilities.
The council's audit and scrutiny committee will hear that up to 32 people in the council have been waiting for about three-and-a-half years for an assessment.
HUG said the delay could prove a real danger to vulnerable people, and warned the system was creaking at the seams. The group said it wanted urgent action to be taken.
Highland Council said it hoped a plan of action would be agreed at the meeting on Thursday.
The council claimed that because of heavy workloads, its officers had had to prioritise cases, but that it was in regular contact with family representatives of those waiting for an assessment to ensure no-one was at risk.
