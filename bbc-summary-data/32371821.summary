A spokesman for Surrey Fire and Rescue Service said: "We have been fighting the fire overnight with six fire appliances and a number of specialist wildfire vehicles, with approximately 50 firefighters.
"These fire crews are using over 10km of hose."
He added: "The fire is affecting 200 hectares, with 50 hectares alight, this can be seen from a considerable distance, with smoke affecting surrounding areas including Pirbright Common, Ash Ranges, Deepcut and Mytchett."
People living nearby have been urged to keep their doors and windows closed due to the smoke.
Surrey Police want to speak to a man wearing a camouflage top, blue jeans and black boots who was seen in the area when the fire started.
