The 24-year-old was out of contract after his one-year deal at National League side Aldershot Town ended.
Beckles has agreed a one-year deal at Stanley, who made the League Two play-off semi-finals last month, with the option of a second year.
"I'm looking forward to the challenge of league football - it's progression to play in the league above," Beckles told the Accrington website.
"The team achieved so much last season and I'm hoping to be part of another successful season here."
