Cardiff Met took the lead after 15 minutes courtesy of a Swans own goal but Katy Hosford found the net with a 30-yard drive to take it to extra time.
In the 107th minute, Hosford scored her second with another effort from close range, but Chloe O'Connor soon levelled to send it to penalties.
Keeper Yzabelle Taylor saved Stacey Webber's penalty to seal it for Met.
Both sides failed to score their first penalty, with Cardiff Met's O'Connor seeing her penalty saved by Courtney Young while Kelly Newcombe missed for Swans.
After both sides scored the rest of their penalties, Taylor made the save in sudden death to gift Cardiff Met the trophy.
The victory means Cardiff Met add the FAW Women's Cup to the League Cup which they won earlier this season by beating the Swans 3-1.
