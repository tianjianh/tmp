[SN]TITLE[SN]
Scunthorpe United 1-2 AFC Wimbledon

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Scunthorpe's promotion hopes suffered another major setback in a home defeat by AFC Wimbledon.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
It is six games without a win now for Scunthorpe, who are struggling to hang on to their top two spot in League One.
After a goalless first-half stalemate in which neither side really threatened, the Iron were sunk by two second-half goals within the space of nine minutes.
Wimbledon opened the scoring on the hour when midfielder Dean Parrett forced his shot home from close range after good work down the left by former Scunthorpe winger Andy Barcham.
The visitors then made it 2-0 in the 69th minute when striker Dominic Poleon found room on the edge of the box to beat keeper Luke Daniels with a sweet shot low into the bottom corner.
Skipper Stephen Dawson did his best to inspire Scunthorpe from midfield and went close with one good second-half effort.
The hosts did manage to reduce the arrears in the 74th minute when leading marksman Josh Morris netted his 20th goal of the season direct from a free-kick on the edge of the box.
It was their first goal in three home games.
Substitutes Scott Wiseman and Kevin Van Veen both went close to an equaliser as Scunthorpe launched a late rally but it could not save them from a second home defeat in three games that could prove costly.
