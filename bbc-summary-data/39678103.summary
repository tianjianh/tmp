It's called a "pneumonia front", but don't worry - it doesn't give you pneumonia! It's the name of a rare weather event over the river.
It looks a bit like a waterspout or tornado, except that the water isn't spinning.
Actually, what the video shows is moisture from the river being pulled upwards, towards a cold cloud.
Video from Ivanka Kauric.
