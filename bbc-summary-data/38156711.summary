Reading FC: Thai owners to sell majority shares to Chinese brother and sister

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Thai consortium which owns Reading is on the brink of selling its shares to a Chinese brother and sister, BBC Radio Berkshire reports.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Negotiations have begun with Dai Yongge and Dai Xiu Li and a deal could be completed "within a fortnight".
Yongge and Xiu Li failed in an attempt to buy Hull City in September.
Current owners Lady Sasima Srivikorn, Sumrith Thanakarnjanasuth and Narin Niruttinanon took control of the Championship club in September 2014.
Reading have so far declined to comment. Manager Jaap Stam's side are third in the league having won five successive matches.
Any deal with Yongge and Xiu Li would see the Thais retain ownership of land around the club's Madejski Stadium, currently earmarked for redevelopment, as well as the Millennium Madejski Hotel.
But the current owners are looking to sell the stadium, the club and the training ground.
Yongge is a businessman who speaks no English. His planned acquisition of Hull from Assem Allam earlier this year reportedly fell through after he failed to meet the FA's fit and proper person test.
He is understood to favour Reading as an investment because he already flies in and out of London regularly for business meetings.
Lady Sasima intends to sell all her shares in the club while the remaining two shareholders, who currently own 75% between them, would greatly reduce their financial stake.
