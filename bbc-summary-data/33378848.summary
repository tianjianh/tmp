Julie Nicholson's daughter Jenny, who was 24 at the time, was one of 52 people killed in a series of explosions on the capital's transport network.
Ms Nicholson resigned from her parish when she was unable to forgive bomber Mohammad Sidique Khan.
Four suicide bombers killed 52 people on London's transport network in 2005.
The attacks were carried out by Mohammad Sidique Khan, 30, Shehzad Tanweer, 22, Hasib Hussain, 18, and Germaine Lindsay, 19.
They targeted Tube trains at Aldgate, Edgware Road and Russell Square, and a bus in Tavistock Square.
"[Forgiveness...] is too easy language, it's too complex and [it's] not about forgiveness," said Ms Nicholson.
Speaking about the Tunisian shootings, Ms Nicholson said the landscape of terrorism is changing.
"My feelings are all for the people of Sousse.
"These people will be shocked, they'll have to deal with it in their own way.
"My heart goes out to them."
A BBC drama will be broadcast on Sunday at 21:00 BST based on Julie Nicholson's book, A Song for Jenny
It tells the story of her daughter, who was one of the victims of the explosion at Edgware Road underground station.
