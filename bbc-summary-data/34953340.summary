[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A racing motorist, whose rival's car careered into a Birmingham bus stop killing a student, has been cleared of causing her death.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Inderjit Singh, 31, was racing Sukvinder Mannan, 33, who lost control and hit Rebecca McManus, as she waited for a bus to go to a hen night.
Singh had admitted dangerous driving, but denied causing the 21-year-old's death in May 2014.
He was also cleared of causing serious injury by dangerous driving.
Wolverhampton Crown Court was told Singh, of Cranbourne Avenue in the city, had been racing his car on Hagley Road West on the evening of 31 May 2014.
Mannan, of Roundhills Road, Halesowen, reached speeds of more than of 100mph in a 40mph zone, the court heard.
He lost control of his Mitsubishi Evolution on a bend, causing it to plough into a bus stop where Miss McManus and her friend were standing.
He admitted causing death and serious injury by dangerous driving, plus failing to provide a blood sample, at an earlier hearing.
Miss McManus had just finished a three-year English Literature and Creative Writing degree at the University of East Anglia.
She suffered "catastrophic injuries" and died at the scene.
Her friend, who was also 21 at the time of the crash, is still recovering from serious injuries.
Sgt Paul Hughes said: "These drivers were not young inexperienced drivers but professional working men who decided to race each other - for reasons we will never understand - along a busy suburban highway.
"Rebecca and her friend were on a night out and did the right thing, they planned their night and decided to catch a bus into town. They thought they would be safe.
"It was the senseless and reckless actions of two men that changed two families' lives forever."
Both men are due to be sentenced on 1 December.
