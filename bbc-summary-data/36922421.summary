Streep is linked to the role of Mary's cousin Topsy - a role that would see her sing, as she did alongside Blunt in 2014 film musical Into the Woods.
Lin Manuel-Miranda, star of Broadway hit Hamilton, will play another new character, a lamplighter named Jack.
Rob Marshall's film is set for release on Christmas Day in 2018.
Set in Depression-era London, the film will see flying nanny Poppins make a return visit to Jane and Michael Banks, now grown-up.
Streep was seen at the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia earlier this week, screaming in delight at the prospect of Hillary Clinton becoming America's first female president.
