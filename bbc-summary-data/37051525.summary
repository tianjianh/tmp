South Africa led 5-0 at the break after Kyle Brown scored in the corner following Roscko Speckman's break.
But Dan Norton stepped inside his man and scored under the posts early in the second half, with Tom Mitchell's conversion giving Britain the lead.
Brave defence kept South Africa out to set up a final with Fiji at 23:00 BST.
Pre-tournament favourites Fiji are guaranteed their first ever Olympic medal of any colour after a 20-5 last-four win over Japan.
Britain's Phil Burgess said: "We will give it our all [in the final] and see what we come out with, but if we show anywhere near that heart and bravery we will come out on the right side of it.
"We dreamt about this 10 weeks ago when we came together. This was what we were aiming for and to be in with the chance, it is exactly what we wanted."
Sir Clive Woodward, England's 2003 World Cup-winning coach who is an analyst for the BBC in Rio, was full of praise for match-winner Norton.
"What an amazing athlete Dan Norton is. He's no only fast, his footwork is fantastic too. His try was seven-a-side rugby at its best," he said.
