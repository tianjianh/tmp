The invasion followed a march by about 2,000 fans before the match on 2 May in protest against the club's owners.
About 150 fans gathered on the pitch at Bloomfield Road just after half-time. The game was called off an hour later.
Police are keen to trace "a small minority" of fans they believe were involved in public order offences.
After examining CCTV footage, detectives have spoken to those who witnessed what happened on the pitch and a number of individuals have already been identified.
They will be spoken to in the coming weeks, but police also want to trace two more men.
Det Insp Jason Richardson said: "Whilst the majority of supporters present at the match behaved in a responsible and peaceful manner, a small minority of supporters overstepped the mark and their conduct is deemed to be unacceptable."
He added police would "look to ensure they are brought to account for their actions".
