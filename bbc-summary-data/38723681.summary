The 22-year-old moved to Sydney Roosters in 2016 from Wigan after scoring 51 tries in 57 outings.
He made just four appearances at the Roosters before agreeing a Wigan return in June 2016, and then spent the second part of season at the Rabbitohs.
"They wanted to keep hold of me," Burgess told BBC Radio Manchester.
"I think I could easily have got out of the contract [with Wigan] but I couldn't turn on my hometown like that.
"If it was any other team, and this sounds bad, I would have tried to fight it to stay there but I'm too loyal to Wigan.
"I don't regret it as I can't wait for this season and hopefully we'll win something."
