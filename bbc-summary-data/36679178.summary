The raids, in the province of Santa Cruz, were ordered by a judge during a probe into allegations of corruption and fraud relating to a company part-owned by the Kirchners.
The Argentine news agency Telam said police were looking for documents.
This is the second time the family's properties have been raided.
Last year a hotel and other buildings were searched.

The judge, Claudio Bonadio, ordered offices and apartments in the towns of Rio Gallegos, El Calafate and El Chalten to be searched.
Telam said the police were looking for documents belonging to the company Los Sauces, part-owned by Mrs Fernandez's children.
Last year a congresswoman, Margarita Stolbizer, filed a legal complaint against the former president and her adult children, Maximo and Florencia, accusing them of fraud and illegal enrichment.
In a separate case, Mrs Fernandez was indicted in May on charges that she was responsible for central bank irregularities in the futures market.
She has accused the current administration of President Mauricio Macri of political persecution.
Mr Macri's government has opened several investigations into alleged corruption during Mrs Fernandez's 2007-2015 presidency.
Earlier this month, one of Mrs Fernandez's top public works officials was caught throwing bags filled with a total of nearly $9m (Â£6.7m) over the walls of a monastery in Buenos Aires province.
He was arrested on suspicion of money laundering.
Mrs Fernandez was married to the late Argentine president Nestor Kirchner.
