Homes and businesses were evacuated after a crack appeared in damaged sea defences in a Devon village.

Buildings were "vibrating" as waves battered the coastline in Torcross on Saturday and a huge crack appeared along sea defences.
A stretch of sea wall collapsed on Friday and a main road was closed.
It is likely the A379 will be shut for about six weeks as repair work gets underway.
Stuart Jacob, Licensee at the Start Bay Inn, said: "The whole building was vibrating, it was like the bay had been turned into an aeroplane.
"We came outside and saw the crack and took the option to close the pub, we didn't think it was safe."
It is hoped single lane traffic can be diverted through a car park to reconnect the village next week.
Josh Gardner, vice-chairman of Stokenham Parish Council, said: "Obviously businesses are worried about what's going to happen and what their future is down here but hopefully we can sort something out."
A statement from South Hams District Council said: "Devon County Council has closed the road, the A379, while it is unsafe to use and intends to start work next week to repair damage to the highway.
"In the meantime diversions are in place. Engineers from South Hams District Council and Devon County Council are on site and assessing the condition of the sea wall in order to limit any further deterioration."
