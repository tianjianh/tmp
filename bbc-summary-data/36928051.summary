Essex started well, with Nick Browne hitting 79, but they struggled when he was removed by Franklin.
The visitors needed 11 runs off the last six balls but lost Ashar Zaidi and finished five runs short on 215-9.
Toby Roland-Jones (4-40) had kept Essex pegged back in their innings with the paceman doing the damage as time ran out for the visitors.
