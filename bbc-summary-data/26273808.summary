[SN]TITLE[SN]
Sheffield libraries to be run by community groups

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Plans to prevent the closure of 10 Sheffield libraries by handing control to community groups have been approved.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Sheffield City Council's cabinet agreed to set aside Â£262,000 from public health funds so voluntary groups can bid for cash to help running costs.
The idea came after thousands of people objected to council plans to close several of the city's 28 libraries.
The authority said it would work with community groups to finalise business plans by June.
Those libraries are: Broomhill, Ecclesfield, Frecheville, Gleadless, Greenhill, Jordanthorpe, Stannington, Totley, Upperthorpe and Walkley.
The council said if groups did not make "sufficient progress, or fail to submit a business plan to the required standard" closures would still be needed.
