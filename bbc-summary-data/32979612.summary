Jacques Parizeau, the former Quebec premier who nearly led the French-speaking province to independence, has died at the age of 84.

His death was announced on Monday night by his wife and fellow former Parti Quebecois politician, Lisette Lapointe.
"He was surrounded by love," wrote Mrs Lapointe on social media. "We love him and will love him forever."
Parizeau led the Parti Quebecois during the 1995 sovereignty referendum which was rejected by a razor-thin margin.
"His ideas light the way for the future," Jean-Francois Lisee, a former adviser and current member of the Canadian legislature wrote on twitter.
Prime Minister Stephen Harper tweeted: "On behalf of all Canadians, Laureen & I extend our deepest condolences to the family & friends of former premier Jacques Parizeau."
In 1995, Quebecers voted 49.6% "Yes" in favour of seceding from Canada, falling just short of the required majority.
For the second time, voters had rejected sovereignty, but the result was much closer than in 1980 when 60% of voters responded "No".
In a speech on the night of the referendum, Parizeau blamed the loss on "money and the ethnic vote", a phrase that sparked accusations of racism.
He resigned the next day and apologised for his comments, but continued to hold significant influence in Quebec politics as he campaigned for sovereignty.
A graduate of the London School of Economics, Parizeau worked as an economic adviser to Quebecer politicians during the Quiet Revolution, a period that expanded the reach of the Quebec government.
The moustachioed politician earned the nickname "the Monsieur" for his use of precise language, his high level of education and penchant for three-piece suits, according to the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation.
