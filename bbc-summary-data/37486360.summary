People who live, work and study in Edinburgh are being asked to play a part in creating a long-term plan for the future of the city.

Business and civic leaders offered their suggestions earlier at a launch event for the "Edinburgh 2050 City Vision" project.
It is based on a successful scheme in New York where the city's inhabitants helped shape a vision for the future.
The final plan will be published next summer.
The aim is to create a long-term proposal which will guide investment and strategy decisions over the next 30 years.
Andrew Kerr, City of Edinburgh Council's chief executive, said: "As Scotland's capital city, we have much to be proud of and positive about but we need to start thinking seriously about what we want Edinburgh to look like in 10, 20, even 30 years time.
"A city vision for Edinburgh based on the true aspirations of people of all ages who live, work and study in the capital will provide all of us with a clear, long-term plan to guide strategy and investment for years to come.
"We're starting with a blank canvas. This will not be a council vision, rather our role will be to facilitate and support citywide collaboration and debate.
"I want to ensure we take new approaches and make new partnerships now to ensure Edinburgh addresses the challenges of the future, remains the envy of the world and offers a great quality of life in decades to come."
