[SN]TITLE[SN]
Exeter City 4-0 Leyton Orient

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Ryan Harley scored twice to help Exeter thrash Leyton Orient 4-0 at St James Park.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Exeter made an excellent start by taking the lead inside four minutes as recalled striker Reuben Reid provided the assist for David Wheeler to score his fourth goal in five matches with a deft close-range finish.
Ollie Watkins, fresh from a hat-trick the day after his 21st birthday at Newport last time out, missed several chances to increase Exeter's lead, with one of those a fierce shot that smashed against the post.
Any fears Exeter may have had of paying the price for those missed chances were dispelled five minutes after the break when Wheeler turned provider for Harley, making his first start since September, to finish at the back-post.
Harley then made it 3-0 on 65 minutes when he converted from the penalty spot after the dangerous Watkins had been fouled by Tom Parkes.
Liam McAlinden finished the scoring on 82 minutes when he was played-in by fellow substitute Robbie Simpson and coolly slipped the ball past Alex Cisak to complete the rout.
