The report, carried by the state-run Xinhua news agency, did not say what measures would be taken.
But the government also said transport during the busy Spring Festival holiday needed to be better managed.
On Tuesday, the relatives of the dead laid flowers at Shanghai's riverfront where the incident took place.
The mourning took place on the seventh day after the death of the relatives, in keeping with Chinese tradition.
The families were accompanied by government handlers and kept away from the media.
The victims, including the youngest a 12-year-old boy, were trampled and asphyxiated as hundreds of thousands of people gathered at the Bund, as the riverfront is known. The cause of the stampede is not known.
China's cabinet also said on Tuesday that governments should take rapid action to ensure safety and respond quickly when accidents occur, Xinhua reported.
