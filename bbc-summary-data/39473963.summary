"I couldn't think of a better place for me to be at this stage of my life," said the former Liverpool boss, 44.
"Sometimes that ambition, you have to be careful, you have to really appreciate what you have.
"The beauty of this group of players and how we're going forward is that they're only going to get better."
Celtic remain unbeaten domestically, winning a sixth consecutive title with eight matches to spare, having won 28 from 30.
Rodgers' side have been top of the table since their third weekend in the competition and wrapped it up with a thumping 5-0 win at Hearts on Sunday.
The club still has a Scottish Cup semi-final against Rangers to come as they chase a possible domestic treble.
"I've always got to be thinking about tomorrow," added Rodgers, who signed a 12-month rolling contract to replace Ronny Deila last May. "The preparation for Wednesday [at home to Partick Thistle], the semi-final of the cup.
"When I came in I said the club was on a winning cycle and I wanted to continue that.

"We'll add to the squad, not very many, all I want to do is add quality.
"You have to spend, but the club have been great for me. We could have signed a player that I wanted to get in the last window, for quite a large sum of money, but for me it has to be the right player.
"If the right player becomes available and the affordability is there then the club will back me like they've done since the first day I walked into Celtic Park.
"I've only started in management really, I've had five jobs. I've already worked in the Premier League.
"I'm a bit older and more mature. I feel very happy here and there's not a place in the world I could be right now where I'd be happier in my football life and personal life - so it's only the start for us.
"I went very close a couple of years ago with my Liverpool team, and there was disappointment in that when it didn't happen, so I couldn't think of a better football club to win my first league title with - the club I've supported all my life.
"I have a responsibility for the supporters. Being one of them, I know what they think and what they want, and I want to bring them as far to that as I possibly can and when my time is up, hopefully I'll have left a legacy here that they can smile about and have enjoyed, and then it'll be over to the next one.
"But until that moment comes, which hopefully won't be for a while, I'm very content."
Asked if this was his biggest achievement in football, Rodgers, who also worked at Watford, Reading and Swansea, replied: "Not really, no, and I'm not trying to downplay it.
"My biggest feeling is how I can influence players, so when I see Stuart Armstrong play like he did, that's my big achievement. When I see Kieran Tierney, Scott Sinclair, Scotty Brown develop, these are my big achievements.
"For any people thinking it's easy, look at Aberdeen the other night [Friday's 7-0 win at Dundee], and how well they played. A really good team, an excellent manager, and they go away and get a victory at a hard place to go.
"It's just been the level of our consistency - the players are getting the rewards for how they work on a daily basis. It wasn't easy, every game is tough."
