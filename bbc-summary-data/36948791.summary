[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Ben Kennedy's strike saw League Two Stevenage knock out Ipswich Town and progress to the EFL Cup second round.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 19-year-old reacted quickest when Dean Gerken parried Charlie Lee's deflected shot in the second half.
Ipswich, who made seven changes, had to wait until the 49th minute for their first shot on target, a long range effort from Kevin Bru.
The Championship side pressed for an equaliser but David McGoldrick's 25-yard strike was turned around the post.
Stevenage, who lost 2-1 at Ipswich in the first round of the same competition last season, held on to complete a memorable victory at Portman Road.
Ipswich manager Mick McCarthy: "I think Stevenage were excellent and deserved to win - I don't want to take anything away from that.
"But I thought we were awful. We weren't too bad in the first half but I don't think we improved in the second half - they were better than us after the break and were the best team overall."
Stevenage manager Darren Sarll: "It has been a good night, especially after Saturday's performance when my players were very harshly criticised for what was a one-off poor display.
"We have reminded everyone about our resolve and determination and I thought we were good tonight.
"This club has had so many good cup nights in its history and I hope we can follow suit."
