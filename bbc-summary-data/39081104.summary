Ex-Spitfires manager Hill was appointed on Wednesday, after talks with chairman Stewart Donald and will look after the first team for the time being.
Allen was sacked after just 84 days in charge of the National League club.
"There will not be a decision made on a new manager until this season is finished," Hill told BBC Radio Solent.
The 53-year-old added: "You cannot keep bringing managers in, relieving them and then paying compensation, then bringing in another one."
Eastleigh play their first game since Allen's sacking on Saturday, when they travel to face Dover Athletic.
