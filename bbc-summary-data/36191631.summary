Cremorne, who is three times the size of a buzzard, went missing on Saturday but a "disaster" happened on Monday when her radio transmitter failed.
The International Centre for Birds of Prey (ICBP) said she was not a threat to people, pets or livestock.
Founder Jemima Parry-Jones said it was "very worrying" because Cremorne did not know how to look after herself.
"She's a temperamental bird and occasionally she goes Awol," said Ms Parry-Jones.
"It's quite serious because this bird has never hunted... and at some point she is going to get emaciated.
"Then we really need to know where she is so we can get her back, give her fluids and get her back up to where she should be."
Cremorne was last spotted near Malswick - some three miles (4.9km) away from home - shortly after 12:00 BST on Monday.
She has a bright white head and tail and a seven-foot (2.1m) wingspan.
