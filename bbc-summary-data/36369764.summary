The 26-year-old joined the Devon side last summer and scored 188 points this season, including 13 tries.
"I know some of the other teams have recruited well but my aim is to get Albion promoted back to the Championship," he said.
"I was shocked to get as many starts last season but the Albion squad pulled together and achieved great things."
Shepherd is the fourth player to commit to the club for next season, following Herbie Stupple, Dan Pullinger and Nile Dacres.
