Paul Anderson, 37, Joanna Farrer, 38, and the girl were convicted at Woolwich Crown Court on Tuesday of religiously aggravated actual bodily harm.
The victims, a mother and daughter, were punched and kicked repeatedly during the attack in Eltham last May.
Anderson, of Sevenoaks, was jailed for three years. Farrer, of Eltham, and the girl will be sentenced at a later date.
The court heard the attack, on 5 May, started when the younger victim had an altercation with the teenager, then aged 12, as she and a boy crossed Middle Park Avenue in Eltham, south east London, in front of her car.
It escalated when the daughter, a 23 year old, met up with her 42-year-old mother and they bumped into the girl and the boy again, who verbally abused the mother.
The girl - who cannot be named because of her age - then attacked the daughter before running off as the woman backed away to call the police.
But she quickly returned with Anderson, Farrer and another, unidentified, woman, the Met Police said.
Anderson punched the 42-year-old woman to the ground whereby one of the female attackers tried to rip off her hijab.
He then punched the younger victim and both women were repeatedly struck by the gang as they lay on the ground, police said.
The attack only stopped when one of the victims managed to flag down a passing ambulance, causing the suspects to flee.
In sentencing, Anderson was ordered to pay Â£2,000 in compensation to the victims and had an extra month added to his sentence after he called the victims and members of the jury "an offensive word" during the trial.
Farrer will be sentenced on 21 April while the girl will be sentenced at Bromley Youth Court on a date to be set.
Melanie Pressley, of the Met Police's Greenwich Community Safety Unit, said: "This was a brutal and completely unnecessary attack on two Muslim women who were racially abused and then assaulted.
"The victims were left terrified by what happened and lived in fear they would be targeted again."
