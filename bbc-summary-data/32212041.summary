Great Blakenham scrap yard fire closes railway line

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Train services were halted after a fire at a scrap yard closed the neighbouring railway line in Suffolk.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Ten cars were alight when six fire crews arrived at 17:40 BST at Sackers yard in Great Blakenham near Ipswich.
Greater Anglia said Suffolk Fire Service had advised services should be suspended on the main line and trains could not run between Ipswich and Stowmarket.
Services resumed at 19:00 BST after nearly two hours of disruption.
Passengers on the 17:30 from Norwich were told via the train's public announcement system that the driver on the service in front had heard "an explosion" next to the railway line.
Adrian Dodds, managing director of Sackers, said: "The fire broke out while staff were on site, but they were unable to contain it.
"People may have heard a series of bangs as airbags, tyres and shock absorbers burst in the heat."
