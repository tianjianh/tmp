Bath tighthead prop Henry Thomas believes the club's signing of Luke Charteris will be the icing on the cake of their strong squad.

Lock Charteris, 32, who has won 62 caps for Wales, arrives at the Rec from Racing 92 at the end of the season.
Thomas said he was happy to see head coach Mike Ford strengthen Bath.
"Signing players like Luke (Charteris) and Dave Denton is like the little bit extra on top," Thomas told BBC Radio Bristol.
"I think we just like to improve every week but it is almost the frosting."
Denton signed from Edinburgh on 10 November following the departure of Sam Burgess who went back to play rugby league for South Sydney Rabbitohs in the NRL.
Bath travel to Leicester on Sunday for the first time since they thumped the Tigers 47-10 in May.
"They will want to atone for that but going there is always a tough place to go so we will have to be right on it," added 24-year-old Thomas.
"I am not sure I have ever won there in my career so it is a big milestone for me to try and win there.
"They pride themselves on the set-piece, there will be some big scrums and big mauls."
