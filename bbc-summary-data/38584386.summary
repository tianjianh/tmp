[SN]TITLE[SN]
European Challenge Cup: Pau 21-22 Cardiff Blues

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Cardiff Blues' European qualification hopes were given a lifeline by the reliable boot of Steven Shingler.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Shingler kicked five penalties, including one with two minutes remaining and scored a conversion as the Blues just avoided defeat.
Pau looked on course to record a first European win of the season when Pierre Dupouy put them back level and Brandon Fajardo added the extras.
Willis Halaholo scored Blues' only try as they remain in contention.
Pau never made life easy for Danny Wilson's side.
Shingler's penalty put Blues ahead, before Paddy Butler charged through Blues territory and found Louis Dupichot who went over in the corner, with Fajardo adding the extras.
Shingler, moved to centre for the contest, reduced the arrears with another penalty, but it was Pau who found the next try, making pressure tell as Julien Thomas drove through, with Fajardo again converting.
Shingler slotted home another penalty as the Blues made tactical adjustments and they then took the advantage when Willis Halaholo showed fine feet and great composure to score in the corner after a Pau error allowed a five metre scrum. Shingler converted.
His reliable boot then made it 19-14 and gave Blues hopes of reaching the next stage, but a powerful drive forward from Pau allowed Pierre Dupouy to cross and Fajardo again added the extras.
Blues looked in desperate trouble then as they trailed 21-19, but Shingler kept his composure to get them out of jail.
Blues head coach Danny Wilson told BBC Radio Wales Sport: "I am first of all pleased and proud of a number of obstacles we faced this week with a growing injury list.
"We patched together and I have to praise the boys for digging in.
"We read the riot act a bit at half time and in the second half did enough to get the win.
"To come to France and get the win is good and we will take that.
"We went more basic in the second half, the shape functioned and we did enough.
"I am pleased, we are still in it and need to beat Bristol next week."
