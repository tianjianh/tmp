De Bruyne, City's second-highest scorer behind Sergio Aguero this season, damaged knee ligaments last month.
"I've already been working cautiously for four weeks now," said the 24-year-old. "Now the brace is off, the real work is about to begin."
The Belgium international joined City from Wolfsburg for Â£55m in August.
"I hope to be back training with the squad in five weeks, after the international break at the end of March," he added.
