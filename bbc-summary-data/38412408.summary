[SN]TITLE[SN]
Rochdale 2-1 Shrewsbury Town

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Rochdale made it 10 home wins in a row as they closed the year with victory over Shrewsbury in League One.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
First-half goals from Ian Henderson and Steven Davies proved enough to keep Keith Hill's men in fourth place while Ivan Toney's late strike was no more than consolation for the struggling Shrews.
Shaun Whalley was denied an early goal when he lost out in a one-on-one with Dale goalkeeper Conrad Logan and the home side took advantage of that let-off by taking a fourth-minute lead.
Shrews defender Mat Sadler's attempt to play the ball forward struck the shins of Davies and rebounded in behind the visitors' backline, sending Henderson scampering through on goal and he finished clinically.
Dale's second goal of the night in the 28th minute came in controversial circumstances.
Davies challenged Jayson Leutwiler to a high ball which the goalkeeper appeared to have caught until it was hooked out of his grasp by Henderson, leaving Davies with the simple task of converting from close range.
The referee was duly surrounded by red and black shirts protesting and there was an air of confusion about the stadium for a few seconds before the realisation the goal was to stand.
Toney's 86th-minute effort raised the visitors' hopes briefly but Dale were good value for the three points.
