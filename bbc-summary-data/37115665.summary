The prolific director began his career in television before going on to direct more than 30 films over six decades.
Oscar-nominated for popular weepie Love Story, his other films included Author! Author!, Silver Streak and The In-Laws.
Current Academy president Cheryl Boone Isaacs said the organisation was "deeply saddened" by his passing.
"I was a member of the Board during his presidency and fortunate enough to witness first-hand his dedication to the Academy and his lifelong passion for visual storytelling," she said in a statement.
"Our condolences go out to his loved ones."
Hiller's work included successful collaborations with playwrights Neil Simon and Paddy Chayefsky and the comedians Steve Martin and Richard Pryor.
But he remains best known for Love Story, a tale of ill-fated lovers that featured the famous line: "Love means never having to say you're sorry."
Starring Ryan O'Neal and MacGraw, the film was nominated for seven Oscars but only received one, for its score.
Hiller had to wait until 2002 to be recognised by the body he presided over from 1993 to 1997, when he received its Jean Hersholt humanitarian award.
Rocky star Carl Weathers, Superbad director Greg Mottola and comedy actor Fred Willard have been among those to pay tribute on Twitter.
MacGraw released a statement, in which she remembered the film-maker as "a remarkable, gifted, generous human being."
"Arthur Hiller was an integral part of one of the most important experiences of my life," she wrote. "My heart and love go out to his family."
The director, whose wife Gwen died in June, is survived by daughter Erica, son Henryk and five grandchildren.
