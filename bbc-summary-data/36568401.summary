Business owners on a Black Country business park say they are not being given enough support to deal with a spate of break-ins.

It is believed the same group of criminals are targeting Lye Valley Industrial Estate several times a week.
West Midlands Police said they will put in place extra measures to help businesses.
However, those with units at the site say they are worried not enough is being done.
Bob Turnock, who operates from Lye Valley, said he had spoken to the force in an effort to improve security at the "demoralised" estate.
"There needs to be a certain police presence down here, and they do need to act on it - it's destroying businesses," he said.
Tetsuya Kuwaki, whose unit was the first to be broken into, said he is "exasperated" with the problem, and may consider moving his business.
"We're looking to invest quite a lot back into the business recently, but at this rate every money that we put into the business is just going to get taken out by some lowlife," he said.
"It feels like nothing's getting done and the thieves can take what they want."
Supt Phil Dolby, from West Midlands Police, said a dedicated detective and new patrol strategy would be put in place to reassure businesses.
He said the force would also work with British Transport Police to secure access from a nearby railway, and look at providing funding to strengthen security.
