Moussa Dembele is happy at Celtic and the club have no plans to sell the striker, says manager Brendan Rodgers.

Asked about reports linking the 21-year-old with Marseille, Rodgers said "100%" no talks had taken place.
"Moussa has been linked with 10 clubs," he said. "There's nothing in it from our perspective.
"There's no rush from Moussa. He loves being here. He knows he is in an incredible environment where he can learn and improve."
Dembele scored 32 goals in 39 games in all competitions for Celtic last season, his first since arriving from Fulham for a compensation fee of Â£500,000.
Celtic host Rosenborg in a Champions League qualifier at Celtic Park on Wednesday.
Dembele did not train on Tuesday because of injury, according to Rodgers.
The France Under-21 international has three years to run on his contract and Rodgers said he had not spoken to the player about his future this summer.
"Part of the plan for Moussa coming in here was that, if he progressed how I thought he would progress and if he wanted to move at any time, it was going to be after the second year," said Rodgers.
"The projection was that he could come here and improve, develop and win trophies and then look as a young player to go and show that he has the consistency to go again the next season.
"To be a successful player, you have to have the mentality to keep going year in, year out.
"He doesn't change either way. There can be lots of speculation. He gets on with his work.
"There will be a natural solution. There will be something at some point in his career here when there is an offer which is a sensible one for both parties.
"It's certainly nowhere near that at this moment. He's a player we want to keep and, if anything ever did come in, we would assess it.
"I haven't put a price on what that would be. What I know is that he's a 21-year-old who is developing and growing and has all the qualities to play at the very highest level."
