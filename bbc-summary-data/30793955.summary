The 21-year-old becomes Eagles boss Alan Pardew's first signing since he left Newcastle to take charge of the club at the start of January.
Sanogo was linked with a move to his native France to join Bordeaux but Gunners boss Arsene Wenger wanted to loan him out to an English club.
"He's a young player with tremendous promise," said Pardew.
"He is somebody that I have tracked personally and this club has too so that fitted well."
France Under-21 international Sanogo has played five games for Arsenal so far this season and scored one goal, which came against Borussia Dortmund in the Champions League.
"We have given him an opportunity. He needs to play more games and I think he's ready for that and he proved that at Arsenal," added Pardew.
"It's tough to get in their team but he's closer to the starting action with us."
