Newport's Avana Bakery consultation starts over closure

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A consultation over plans to close a Newport bakery with the loss of 150 jobs has begun.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Food Utopia said it planned to end production at Avana Bakeries in Rogerstone by the end of January.
The firm said the factory, which also cut hundreds of workers in 2014, had been running at a loss and it was "financially unsustainable".
The Bakers, Food and Allied Workers Union said a 45-day consultation with staff would start on Thursday.
It said there was a cake production surplus in the country and people were not eating as many baked goods as they used to.
Food Utopia said the site had been "unable to make sufficient progress in an increasingly competitive market".
The firm said it would explore all options and seek as much external support as possible as it began discussions about the future of the bakery.
