What we know about Assad from his BBC interview

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
He seems like a softly-spoken and slightly awkward man but to many he is a fierce and ferocious dictator.

President Assad is accused of killing tens of thousands  in a war with an estimated death toll of 200,000.
In his first interview with the BBC for over four years he insists he is in power to protect Syria "when it's under attack, not to flee and run away".
We take a look at the five things we learned.
The situation in Syria has become almost completely dominated with the battle to stop the militant group Islamic State.
In September, an American-led coalition began airstrikes on IS extremists who have taken control of key areas in Syria and neighbouring Iraq.
President Assad says IS terrorists are behind many attacks on his forces but that doesn't mean he'll team up with America to beat the black-clad Islamists.
He says his government "cannot be in alliance with the country which support the terrorism".
He is referring to help the American-led coalition offered rebels fighting the Syrian army in the civil war.
Assad also claims the Islamic State ideology "has been supported by the royal family" in Saudi Arabia.
Professor Gareth Stansfield is a Middle East expert at the University of Exeter and thinks there is little evidence to support Assad's claim.
"The government of Saudi Arabia has gone to great lengths to publicly distance itself from the Islamic State and denies any accusation that it has provided support to the organisation - formally or otherwise," he explained.
President Assad accuses the Americans of "trampling over international law".
"They don't talk to us and we don't talk to them. Sometimes we talk through a third party and they convey a message, but there is nothing tactical."
Professor Stansfield says: "It's unlikely that there will be direct dialogue between the Assad regime and the US, but it would seem logical that there has been some form of communication.
"The evidence would suggest it [communication] has happened as the Assad regime seems rather relaxed about the ongoing use of its airspace," he added.
The use of "barrel bombs" - barrels packed with explosives - has been repeatedly condemned by human rights groups.
President Assad's forces are believed to have killed thousands of people in Syria using them.
"This is a childish story," President Assad responded.
"The army uses missiles, bullets and bombs, I haven't heard about them using barrels or maybe even cooking pots.
"There are no indiscriminate weapons, when you shoot you aim and when you aim you aim to protect civilians against terrorists."
The pictures you see here obviously show the scars of war in a country many say is now a "failed state".
But President Assad says: "We cannot talk about a failed state. Talking about losing control is something completely different.
"There is an invasion of terrorists coming from abroad and the government is doing its job in defending and fighting for its country."
"The fact that Mr Assad has started giving interviews again must be a sign that he is feeling more secure," says interviewer Jeremy Bowen, the BBC's Middle East editor.
"I have always believed that Bashar al-Assad is the chairman of the board of the family business."
President Assad wouldn;t admit that he had made mistakesduring his country's four year-long crisis.
He says: "I never said we made mistakes in handling this. I always said that anyone could make mistakes."
Professor Stansfield says: "Personally, I think he is viewing the way that Western powers are responding to the Islamic State threat as being an opportunity for him to drive a wedge between them and the opposition forces against him.
"He does this while at the same time containing the Islamic State - before it can become a threat to the survival of his regime."
