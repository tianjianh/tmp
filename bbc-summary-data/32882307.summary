Andy Moll was part of a three-man team exploring a wreck six miles south of Swanage, some 131ft (40m) below the surface, on Sunday.
Father-of-four Mr Moll, from North Curry, near Taunton, is said to have more than 30 years' diving experience.
The Maritime and Coastguard Agency called off the search for Mr Moll, who remains missing, on Sunday.
Leon Smith, chair of Severnside Sub Aqua Club, said Mr Moll was a "great personal friend" to many club members.
"Andy has been a long-standing, active, and well-respected member of the diving community," he said.
"Everyone who knows Andy is truly devastated by recent events and our thoughts and concerns are with his family and all those involved."
Mr Moll also served nationally with the British Sub-Aqua Club (BSAC) and had been an instructor trainer.
"He was full of passion and enthusiasm and the BSAC, and had a true love of scuba diving, and all that went with it.
"Andy was also a real family man and our thoughts and sincere condolences go out to them, in particular his wife Elaine and four daughters."
Mr Moll failed to surface while diving with two others from the boat Emma J off Swanage and the emergency services were alerted.
