Peak season: Winter in Scotland's mountains

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Scottish Avalanche Information Service has come to the end of its first week of its latest season assessing for the hazard in Scotland's highest mountains.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Every winter, the service (SAIS) provides reports for Lochaber, Glen Coe, Northern Cairngorms, Southern Cairngorms, Torridon and Creag Meagaidh.
And, as images taken by the various SAIS teams show, conditions have been changing quickly in the hills.
