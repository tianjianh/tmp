Tyson Fury says there is more to come from him after he beat Wladimir Klitschko to become the WBA, IBF and WBO heavyweight champion of the world.

The 27-year-old Briton outpointed the 39-year-old Ukrainian in Dusseldorf, Germany to bring his nine-year reign to an end.
"I think you have seen 65% of what I am capable of," the self-styled 'Gypsy King' told Sky Sports News.
"That wasn't as good as I can do. I can go up another level."
The Manchester fighter insisted he would beat Klitschko again if the former champion takes up the option of a rematch - and would be happy for it to be in Germany.
"If he had 10 years to train, the result would be the same next time," Fury said. "I think he will take the rematch, but who knows when he gets home and has time to think about it.
"It doesn't really matter to me where I fight. Japan, Turkey, Azerbaijan, America - wherever it has to be. I'd like to come back to Germany again to fight Wlad. I enjoyed it here and I got a great reception from the German fans."
He added. "I might be allowed a voluntary defence [before a potential rematch with Klitschko] and I would like to have that back in England, probably in Manchester.  It would be great to bring the titles back."
Fury is keen to spend time over the festive period with his family, including pregnant wife Paris, who he serenaded at ringside after his victory. The couple already have a daughter, Venezuela, and a son Prince.
But attention has already turned to who else Fury could face in defence of his titles.
Irish legend Barry McGuigan told BBC Radio 5 live that David Haye, the British former world champion, making his comeback in January after three years in retirement, is "the obvious fight" for Fury.
He added: "Anthony Joshua is full of promise but hasn't done anything at the top level yet.  Deontay Wilder [the American WBC world champion] would be a great fight for him.  Wilder is a slashing, hard fighter but he was hurt himself in his last defence by a journeyman fighter.

"I don't think either of them are that fantastic to be honest. Both can look vulnerable at times. Fury is unbeaten and would be favourite but Wilder is a great puncher."
Fury himself has played down a potential bout against Wilder. "Why do we need to mention Deontay Wilder? Let's laugh at his name, shall we? Why would I be bothered about a novice like Wilder?
"He's a basketball player who took up boxing a couple of years ago. I'm a true natural fighter. I've been doing it all my life. You get horses and dogs and it's bred into them to be what they are, whether it's racehorses or show dogs. And it's bred into me to be a fighter.
"So, if Deontay Wilder wants a unification fight he is going to have to wait, because Wladimir Klitschko has a round two....ding ding ding!"
The pair were due to fight twice, in 2013 and 2014, but Haye pulled out on both occasions because of injury, leading to bad blood between the pair.
"I hope Fury can win a rematch and take the titles back to Britain again as a free agent," Haye told BBC Radio 5 Live's Sportsweek.
"It throws the division up in the air and makes it really exciting for once.
"We now have a crazy guy with the belts. It might be negative but it makes you laugh and it's better than being bored to tears by Klitschko.
"I would like my opportunity to work my way up the rankings and have a crack at him. As long as he takes belts away that makes him my target.
"Because of the history between us, Fury's camp won't give me any voluntary fights. We don't get on that great so I will have to work my way up to become the mandatory challenger for one of his titles."
Fury has paid tribute to his uncle and trainer Peter, who he believes revitalised his career after they started working together in 2012.
"When I started with Peter, I was going to stop boxing," he said. "I was flat, I was out of shape, I was 24 stone. I wasn't doing the right things, I was drinking and going out a lot," he said.
"But we stuck at it, trained every day, week on week. Since January 2012, we have only taken about two or three weeks off - and Peter has to take a lot of credit for that.
"It has been a long road to get here but I am finally here, parked up in front of view, in the shop window."
"Money, fame, gloryâ€¦nothing changes the man unless they want it to," Fury said. "I am really comfortable with the man I am today. I will be the same person I was when I started boxing. Nothing is going to change me."
Fury has previously claimed he has no interest in being a role model and has been a controversial figure in the build-up to the Klitschko fight.
One of Britain's former world heavyweight champions, Lennox Lewis, believes he may need to modify his behaviour to assume the responsibility that comes with the title.
"Now he's champion he has to behave himself a little bit more because there are a lot of kids and people looking up to him," Lewis told Sportsweek.
"There are a lot of different boxers and people who will have a lot of things to say about him. If you allow [Fury] to say what he wants without coming back then you are soft to him. He won't respect you unless you directly come back at him.
"But he's a different character in the heavyweight scene. His character captures the imagination of people."
