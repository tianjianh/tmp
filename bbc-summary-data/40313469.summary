Sally Pollard, 39, who had played the role for more than 12 years, died at their home on Friday evening.
Tim Pollard, 53, said she was the "love of my life, my world and she will always be with us and a part of us".
He said Mrs Pollard, who was diagnosed in 2015, was "brilliant and passionate" about raising awareness of the disease not only as a doctor, but as a patient.
"She was surrounded by the people who love her," he said.
"Our three-year-old daughter Scarlett has been brilliant, she made sure Sally had water and was comfortable.
"I've been comforted enormously by everyone close to us... and the support and messages have been overwhelming and incredible.
"It's given me genuine comfort that she touched so many lives, in so many ways - she made a difference to the world."
Mr Pollard added: "She had the best treatment she possibly could and was really looked after and loved.
"I'm asking people to raise a smile, raise a glass and raise money for cancer charities in her memory."
Mrs Pollard was a doctor of genetics at the University of Nottingham and enjoyed taking part in re-enactments.
Mr Pollard has been playing the city's famous outlaw for more than two decades.
The couple fell in love while playing the famous duo and married in September.
He said: "The day after the wedding she was taken into hospital, we found out that the cancer had spread to her brain. She then lost the use of her legs."
Instead of wedding presents the newly weds had asked for donations towards a relaxing space for Mrs Pollard.
