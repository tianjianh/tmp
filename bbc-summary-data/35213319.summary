With five balls remaining, the 30-year-old Sussex captain sealed a seven-wicket victory with his 11th four, and also hit four sixes in a 66-ball knock.
Cameron White made 54 from 39 balls to help the Renegades to 161-7.
Kevin Pietersen made only six for the Stars but Wright, with only 39 from three previous innings, saw them home.
"Once I got to 30 or 40 it was about going longer and deeper, and trying to get those partnerships building," said Wright, who made the most recent of his 51 Twenty20 appearances for England in March 2014.
It was a second consecutive victory for the Stars, who had lost their opening two fixtures in the 20-over competition. The eight teams each play four home and four away matches, with the top four qualifying for the semi-finals.
