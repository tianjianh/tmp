Lawyer calls for Libyan compensation in fund for all Troubles victims

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A Belfast lawyer says a social welfare fund should be set up with compensation from Libya that would assist all the victims of the Troubles.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Paul Tweed was giving evidence to the Northern Ireland Affairs committee at Westminster.
The committee is investigating the issue of compensation for Libyan-sponsored violence.
The late Libyan leader Colonel Muammar Gaddafi supplied arms to the IRA during the Troubles.
Libyan Semtex was a key weapon in its bombing campaign.
Mr Tweed said Semtex provided by Libya "perpetuated the Troubles".
He said a social welfare fund should be established with compensation from Libya for all the victims.
He said such a fund would be administered by a committee appointed by the Northern Ireland Executive.
Mr Tweed said it would be "morally and possibly legally wrong that a limited of victims should be entitled to receive exemplary compensation".
The Belfast solicitor was asked by the DUP MP Ian Paisley to define who a victim was, but Mr Tweed said that was a matter "for politicians".
Libya compensated US victims of terrorism, but UK victims were left out of the deal.
Mr Tweed was asked by UUP MP Danny Kinahan where the Libyan compensation might come from and whether it was tied up in "investments, bank accounts or shares".
He was also asked how all victims of terrorism could be compensated.
Mr Tweed replied that his idea of a social welfare fund with input from politicians and victims could assist. He said all options "should be explored "
Quizzed by independent MP Lady Hermon on whether he was frustrated by the length of time this issue had gone unresolved, he said that "there is a finite time to deal with this issue ".
Mr Tweed said he was frustrated that the issue of compensation for Troubles victims had not been resolved and he told the committee: "It is beyond belief we are sitting here having this conversation."
Michael Gallagher, who lost his son Aiden in the 1998 bomb attack in Omagh, also gave evidence.
Mr Gallagher highlighted the case of RUC Detective Constable Garry Ewing and council recreation officer Helen Woodhouse, who were killed by an IRA bomb in November 1982 in Enniskillen.
Questioned by DUP MP Gavin Robinson about the ongoing campaign for compensation, Michael Gallagher said the British government had a "moral obligation" to help victims.
He said such a move  would "send a message to rogue governments".
Last week a former UK Ambassador to Libya said the decision in 2008 to exclude Troubles victims from an American compensation deal was "sad and negative" and "deeply regrettable".
Sir Vincent Fean told MPs it would have been beneficial if American victims and Troubles victims had joined forces in their compensation claim.
