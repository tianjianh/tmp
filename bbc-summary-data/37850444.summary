Europa League: Zenit St Petersburg 2-1 Dundalk

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Dundalk produced a battling performance as a double from Brazilian Giuliano gave Zenit St Petersburg a 2-1 win in Thursday's Europa League Group D game.

Giuliano fired home right-footed to give the Russians the lead before half-time but Daryl Horgan levelled with a composed finish on the counter-attack.
The hosts nudged ahead with a scrappy goal after Dundalk failed to clear, before Patrick McEleney hit the bar.
Zenit qualify for the last 32 while Dundalk retain hopes of joining them.
Former Uefa Cup winners Zenit have won all four of their fixtures so far, with Dundalk joined on four points by Maccabi Tel-Aviv, who drew 0-0 at home to bottom side in the group, AZ Alkmaar.
Dundalk host Alkmaar in their next game in the competition at the Tallaght Stadium in Dublin on 24 November, a fixture which should prove crucial to their hopes of progressing to the knockout stages.
The visitors made a promising start when John Mountney's cross-cum-shot smacked off the bar, with home goalkeeper Mikhail Kerzhakov stranded.
Zenit began to gain the upper hand however and Oleg Shatov forced Gary Rogers into a fine diving save, while the same player's seemingly goalbound left-foot drive cannoned off Dane Massey.
The League of Ireland champions continued their determined rearguard action but their defence was finally breached with four minutes of the first half remaining.
Defender Brian Gartland was caught in possession and Giuliano completed a fine breakaway goal to ease his side's frustration.
Seven minutes after the break, Stephen Kenny's side levelled after Horgan, who was called up to the Republic of Ireland squad this week, ran from inside his own half and tucked the ball into the net.
Rogers continued to produce heroics to maintain parity, but Giuliano's strike for his fifth goal of the tournament proved decisive.
McEleney could have grabbed a second equaliser for his side but was unfortunate to see his well-struck lob come off the woodwork with the goalkeeper off his line.
Match ends, Zenit St Petersburg 2, Dundalk 1.
