The 28-year-old is the first player to leave the Lady Black Cats since the top-flight club announced it would revert to being a part-time club.
Furness, who had two spells over 12 years at Sunderland, joins Reading on a contract until June 2018.
"Rachel is a brilliant addition to our squad and she brings great experience," said Reading boss Kelly Chambers.
