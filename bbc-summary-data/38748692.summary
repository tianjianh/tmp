The community-led Stove Network wants to see more buildings brought under local control and create new housing and services on the High Street.
Nearly 500 people have backed their vision of a Midsteeple Quarter in the heart of the town.
It follows an online survey which asked the public for its views on how to improve the area.
Melissa Gunn, of the University of the West of Scotland, who are members of the community partnership leading the project, said they had been "overwhelmed" by the response.
"Online surveys often bring out more negative responses, but here the opposite was true," she said.
"We were particularly surprised by 40% of people saying they themselves would be keen to live in the town centre."
The survey found backing for a "populated town centre" in order to make the area more vibrant.
There was also "strong support" for a mix of accommodation from affordable tenancies to student accommodation and private flats available in the upper floors above shops.
Matt Baker of The Stove Network said: "Everyone in the team is just delighted by the progress to date - this feels like a very different approach for the town with a diverse mix of local people and groups leading the project.
"Everyone is bringing their own expertise and experience and being respectful of what others have to contribute.
"We have had excellent support from right across the council - this really could be the beginning of the long-hoped-for turnaround in the fortunes of Dumfries town centre."
