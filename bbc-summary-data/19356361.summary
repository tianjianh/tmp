Radio is a key news source; there are hundreds of stations, most of them commercial. Spanish-owned Prisa Group is a major player.
Two commercial groups own the bulk of print titles.
The constitution guarantees press freedom and the media can criticise the government and cover sensitive topics.

By 2016, 14 million Chileans were online (Internetlivestats.com), around 78% of the population. There are no restrictions on access.
