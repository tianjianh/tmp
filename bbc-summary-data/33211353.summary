[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Thousands of people have gathered at Stonehenge to mark this year's summer solstice.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Police said 23,000 attended the neolithic site in Wiltshire to watch the sun rise at 04:52 BST, while others gathered at the nearby Avebury stone circle.
The figure was down on the estimated 36,000 who attended last year and the 30,000 expected this year.
Wiltshire Police said the celebrations were "positive and peaceful".
The summer solstice usually occurs on 21 June, but can occur on 20 and 22 June.
Police said arrests were lower than in previous years, with nine people being held for drugs offences at Stonehenge and a handful being cautioned for possession of Class A drugs, while no arrests were made at Avebury.
Next year's summer solstice will occur on 20 June, but the next 22 June solstice will not occur until 2203.
