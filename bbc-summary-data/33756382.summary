The Dundrod-based event is set to begin with practice sessions at noon on Wednesday 5 August.
Racing starts on Thursday, culminating in the main race on Saturday 8 August.
The main roads affected are Hannahstown Road; Rock Road; Leathemstown Road; Quarterland Road; Tornagrough Road and Upper Springfield Road.
Minor roads that will also be affected are Rushyhill Road; Budore Road; Glenside Road; Ballycolin Road; Tullyrusk Road; Cochranestown Road and Sycamore Road Fort Road.
The closures will be in place from noon until 21: 30 BST on Wednesday, from 10:30  until 21:30 on Thursday and from 09:30 until 20:30 on Saturday.
Full details will be posted on the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) website and its Lisburn Facebook page.
The competition coincides with Bike Safety Week and the PSNI's district commander for Lisburn and Castlereagh appealed to bikers to obey road safety laws at all times.
Supt Sean Wright said: "Emulating your favourite professional racer on public roads will at the least get you into trouble with police. At most, you could be involved in a fatal collision.
"Three riders have died in motorcycle collisions in Northern Ireland this year and I make a heartfelt plea to all bikers - if you are coming to Dundrod, ride with safety in mind, stay within the speed limits and ride steady.
"Anyone seen riding in an erratic or dangerous fashion will be stopped by police. In addition, we are reminding all drivers that they need to be aware of greater numbers of motorcyclists using the road network, particularly when emerging from and turning into junctions," he added.
