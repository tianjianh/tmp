You asked us where the phrase "Yam Yam" to describe someone from the Black Country came from.
You wanted to know why the cooling towers at Ironbridge's power station are set to be demolished?
Another question was who has spray painted owls on walls in Hanley, Stoke-on-Trent and why?
And are there secret tunnels under Hereford?
The Urban Dictionary website said it derived from the Black Country dialect for "you are" - "yam".
Terry Price, a historian born in Great Bridge in West Bromwich, said the pronunciation in dialect was nearer to "y'owm" or "yo am" instead of "you are".
"I'd never heard of that expression in my youth," said 78-year-old Mr Price. "I think it's a relatively recent thing."
Birmingham historian Carl Chinn said he believed the phrase may have been introduced in the 1970s or 1980s but could not say so with certainty.
The editor of the Black Country Society's magazine, The Blackcountryman, Michael Pearson, said when he worked in the police in the 1980s they used the phrase to distinguish Black Country folk from Brummies, who they called Lardi's (as in la-di-dah).
He said it came from a take on the Black Country accent in phrases like "y'am alright".
The bridge isn't the only landmark in Ironbridge Gorge. The nearby power station's cooling towers have stood since 1969 but they are scheduled for demolition. Here's why.
The subject has generated a lot of debate on the BBC Shropshire Facebook page.
Tom Rochester is in favour of knocking them down, writing: "People are strange aren't they. Build anything like these now and people complain. Demolish them now and people complain. People just don't like change I suppose."
Sharon Jones said she wanted to keep them: "We can't let them be demolished. It's my all time high when I see them. It's a big part of Ironbridge."
Some readers described them as a "blot on the landscape" or an "eyesore", but others suggested they would look good if they were illuminated.
Hidden in plain sight the owls of Hanley, Stoke-on-Trent stare back - but who created them and what inspired the pictures? Here is the answer.

There are certainly urban rumours about a secret tunnel running from an archway under the old bridge across the Wye to the cathedral.
But a spokesman for Hereford Cathedral said: "If there is a secret tunnel then it's very secret, because we don't know about it."
Alfred Watkins, the Hereford-born author and photography pioneer, also investigated the legend that there was a tunnel connecting the Priory of St Guthlac with its vineyard on the banks of the River Wye.
He'd found traces of it on a map dating from 1865. Watkins was also an enthusiastic amateur archaeologist and he and a friend conducted a dig on the "tunnel".
He was disappointed to find it was "some kind of natural fault or crevice [and] not man made".
There are, however, plenty of plenty of interesting tunnels across this area, some secret, other not - here's a slideshow of some of them.
