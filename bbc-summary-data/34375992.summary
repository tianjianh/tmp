Corbyn for No10? Perfectly feasible, says Welsh MP

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Labour MP who will run the party's assembly election campaign next year has admitted there will be public "differences of opinion" within the party under Jeremy Corbyn's leadership.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Vive la diffÃ©rence, says Labour MP
Huw Irranca-Davies said Labour shouldn't be scared of the challenge Mr Corbyn faces in uniting a party despite winning little support among MPs during his successful campaign.
The Ogmore MP, who nominated Mr Corbyn but didn't vote for him, said local constituency parties had seen massive membership increases since the general election.
You can watch the interview (about 40 minutes in) here.
He told me in an interview for Sunday Politics Wales: "Over the summer there's been a real energy and enthusiasm coming forward. Now into the conference I think this is going to be different. I think there is going to be much more engagement in policy-making at a real level in a really practical way.
"It's not something to be afraid of, and some of those big policy issues as well I think are the ones to debate very frankly, very openly, and there will be differences of opinion.  Yes, that's the way politics works. If the Labour Party is a broad church, then it needs to not only do that and have those debates, but then focus on how do we actually get back and win power as well."
Mr Irranca-Davies defended the Welsh government's record on the NHS and said it was closing the gap on schools with England.
Asked if he could see Jeremy Corbyn as prime minister after the 2020 election, he said: "Absolutely. Perfectly feasible because if you look at the enthusiasm he's engendered and the different style he's brought to politics - open, engaging, frank and honest. If you look at the public polling, people will say 'this chap believes what he says and he is frank and honest'."
