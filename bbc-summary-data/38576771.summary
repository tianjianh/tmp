A man has admitted killing a friend with a single punch in a pub in Bedford.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Nigel Williams, 39, pleaded guilty to manslaughter but denies the murder of Mark Munday in the Grafton Hotel in Midland Road on 4 December.
The incident was described as a "one punch homicide case" at Luton Crown Court on Tuesday.
Judge Michael Kay QC remanded Mr Williams in custody. A trial will now take place in May.
Mr Williams, an electrical engineer of Cowper Street, Olney, appeared in court via video link from Norwich prison.
Mr Munday, 48, from Kempston, died in hospital several hours after an incident at the hotel on 4 December.
Prosecutor Tim Prober-Wood told the judge: "This is a one punch homicide case. It seems likely the plea tendered will be accepted."
He added that the results of a full post-mortem examination will also have to be taken into consideration.
A further hearing will take place on 10 April. A trial date has been set for 15 May.
