[SN]TITLE[SN]
Scotland's Cricket World Cup team - who are they?

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The words 'Scotland' and 'World Cup' do not go together as often as we would like these days.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
But, on Monday, the Scottish international cricket team will play at the 2015 cricket showpiece in Australia and New Zealand.
Of the 14 teams in this World Cup tournament, Grant Bradburn's men are probably rated with the least chance of making any progress.
New Zealand, England, Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Australia lie in wait in Pool A.
A few shoots of promise have been sprouting recently in the Scots' camp and perhaps this team can do what the national team has never done before....
...win a game at a World Cup.
Here are the men that will be trying to do it....
Head coach - Grant Bradburn, 48
Assistant coach - Craig Wright, 40
Captain - Preston Mommsen, 27
Vice-captain - Kyle Coetzer, 30
Richie Berrington, 27
Freddie Coleman, 23
Matt Cross, 22
Josh Davey, 24
Ally Evans, 26
Hamish Gardner, 23
Majid Haq, 32
Michael Leask, 24
Matt Machan, 23
Calum MacLeod, 26
Safyaan Sharif, 23
Rob Taylor, 25
Iain Wardlaw, 29
