Plans to convert a disused underground bunker into a music centre have been backed by Wiltshire councillors.

Harnham bunker, officially known as Salisbury Urban District Control Centre, has been empty for years.
Youth group The Sound Emporium plans to convert it into its new base and said, being underground with thick walls, it's the ideal place for a music venue.
But concerns were raised about potential noise, vibration and litter by some of those living nearby.
Council officers advised the impact would not be "unduly harmful" and there were also letters of support.
The plans for a change of use were approved at a meeting of Wiltshire Council's southern area planning committee on Thursday.
Ross Sanderson, of the Sound Emporium, told the BBC the venue was "unique" and "inspiring".
"What better place to have a music venue than underground, with the natural soundproofing of the earth plus between 5ft-10ft thick concrete walls?"
Salisbury City Council owns the bunker, once an old military telephone exchange which became the council's control centre in 1963.
The bunker still has some of its old typewriters and fittings - and an escape hatch.
