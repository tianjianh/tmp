[SN]TITLE[SN]
Aberdeen 'no ball games' signs could be kicked into touch

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Aberdeen could become the first city in Scotland to remove all of its "no ball games" signs from public areas.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A report to councillors next week has said the signs are not legally enforceable.
It also claims they are a deterrent to outdoor play.
The communities and housing committee will be asked to approve a plan to remove them when it meets next Thursday.
