[SN]TITLE[SN]
Sheffield United 2-1 Charlton Athletic

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
League One champions-elect Sheffield United moved another step closer to a return to the Championship with victory over Charlton.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Goals from Jack O'Connell and Daniel Lafferty saw the Blades come from behind to stretch their unbeaten run to nine games and extend their lead over third-placed Fleetwood to 10 points.
They had to do it the hard way after Charlton took a third-minute lead, when Ricky Holmes curled a superb 25-yard free-kick over the wall and past Simon Moore.
It was reward for an electric start by the Addicks and it was almost two minutes later when Tony Watt's overhead kick hit the crossbar and bounced clear.
The Blades finally settled and wiped out their deficit in the 14th minute when defender O'Connell headed home Mark Duffy's delicious delivery.
And they took the lead just three minutes after the restart when Lafferty converted at the second attempt following Declan Rudd's save from an initial header.
Chris Wilder's side had chances to make it more comfortable in the second half, but Samir Carruthers shot into the side-netting and Chris Basham headed just over.
