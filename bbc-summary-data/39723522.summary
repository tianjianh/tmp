Ross Chisholm and Charlie Mulchrone have signed new contracts with Premiership club Harlequins.

Chisholm, who can play at full-back or on the wing, came through Quins' youth system and has made 78 appearances for the club since his debut in 2009.
Scrum-half Mulchrone, 27, joined Quins from Worcester Warriors last season and has played 11 times this term.
"They both complement the environment I am seeking to create within the club," said director of rugby John Kingston.
"They are both real team players who have a significant positive influence on others around them."
Their new deals follow the announcements that the experienced duo of fly-half Nick Evans and scrum-half Karl Dickson will both retire at the end of the season.
Harlequins are seventh in the Premiership - one place and one point outside the automatic qualifying spots for next season's European Champions Cup - with two games left to play.
