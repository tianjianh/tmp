A plane carrying Manchester City captain Vincent Kompany came off the runway after the pilot lined up with the wrong set of lights, accident investigators have said.

The Citation CJ2 skidded off the runway at Norwich Airport in January.
Three passengers were on board the aircraft when two crew members mistook the runway's left edge lights for its centre, causing the plane to veer off.
The underside of the aircraft was damaged but no-one was injured.

Defender Kompany, who was reportedly on board at the time, had been sidelined with a calf injury for his team's FA Cup third-round game against Norwich City at Carrow Road before the flight.
After the incident on 9 January, the airport was closed to "fixed wing traffic" while the plane was removed.
The plane's captain told the Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) he lined the aircraft up in the wrong position because he did not follow the green turning circle taxiway lights.
When the plane started to accelerate, it "veered rapidly to the left" and went on to grass next to the runway, the AAIB found, causing the pilot to abort takeoff.
