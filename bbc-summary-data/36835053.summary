Both players have joined the Premier League newcomers for undisclosed fees and on three-year deals, which have an option for a further year.
Gudmundsson was part of the Iceland side that knocked England out of Euro 2016 with a shock 2-1 victory.
The winger provided 11 assists last season but was part of a Charlton side relegated from the Championship.
"The atmosphere around the club is fantastic," he said. "Playing against the team last season I saw just how good the club was."
The duo are Burnley manager Sean Dyche's first summer signings.
He said he had been impressed by the "quality" Gudmundsson showed during a "tough time" for Charlton.
"It helps to see a player in the European Championship with that kind of company and he did well there," he added. "It was one we all agreed would be a good acquisition for the club."
Dyche said Pope was a "young keeper who we think has got a lot of promise".
He added: "He's a good keeper now but we think he can mature and get even better keeper during his time here."
