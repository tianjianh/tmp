[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A dog DNA database could be used to identify pets fouling public places in Flintshire, a councillor has said.

Arnold Woolley has tabled a formal notice of motion calling on the county council to set up a panel to explore the possibility of creating an "information bank" of dogs and owners.
The idea will be discussed at a County Hall meeting in Mold this week.
Flintshire council launched a smartphone app to pinpoint problem areas in 2012.
The Buckley councillor said irresponsible owners who "display no social conscience" should be targeted.
People who do not clean up after their pet face a Â£75 fixed penalty fine or a Â£2,500 penalty if the case ends up in court.
Councillors can agree or reject the motion at a meeting of Flintshire council on Thursday.
