New road layout at Barry Island to ease traffic gridlock

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
New road measures are being put in place to ease gridlock at Barry Island after traffic jams last weekend.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Motorists were stuck for hours over the Easter holiday following the reopening of Barry Island Pleasure Park.
In anticipation of another busy weekend, a trial road layout at the Ship Hill junction will give priority to traffic leaving the resort.
Traffic officers will also help to keep traffic moving between 14:00 BST and 19:00 BST on Saturday and Sunday.
