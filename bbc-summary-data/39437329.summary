[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Rosalin Baker, 25, told jurors she was "petrified" of Jeffrey Wiltshire, 52, and that he was responsible for 16-week-old Imani's death.
She also told the Old Bailey Mr Wiltshire had caused injuries to her child's head, ribs and wrist in the lead-up to her death.
Both deny murder.
In the week before Imani's death, Ms Baker had left her mother's home to live with Mr Wiltshire in his bedsit in Newham, east London, the court was told.
Giving evidence, Ms Baker told jurors she began a relationship with Mr Wiltshire, who claims to have fathered 23 children, when she was aged just 18,.
He "regularly" used violence against her, slapping, punching and hitting her with the handle of a knife, she said.
On one occasion, she said he attacked her while she was holding Imani in her arms.
When asked why she didn't leave her partner, she said: "Because he kept stopping me and threatening me saying I can't leave him."
Ms Baker told jurors her partner took drugs "every day", in particular cocaine, heroin and cannabis.
She admitted she had also taken heroin and cocaine but not so often.
Jurors previously heard Ms Baker was given the "thumbs up" by her partner as she boarded a bus in Stratford while carrying the corpse of their daughter.
Prosecutors alleged Ms Baker pretended the child had fallen ill and appealed to early morning commuters for help in a "nightmare charade".
Imani was allegedly subjected to at least three severe attacks which left her with 40 fractures to her ribs, a fractured wrist and terrible head injuries.
The trial continues.
