A £2,000 reward has been offered after new foodlights were stolen from a Boston church.

The two LED lights were taken from St Botolph's Church, known as Boston Stump, on Monday.
The church had planned a special service to mark the switch-on after the original lights were damaged in the 2013 floods.
Church-goer Peter Sherlock said he was "very upset that the church is being persecuted in this way".
"We need to have the Stump as a shining light and a beacon in the area," he said, after offering to pay another £2,000 to replace the lights.
The reward is offered for information leading to an arrest "of the person or people responsible".
Anyone with information about the damage is asked to contact police.
Reverend Alyson Buxton, said: "There is so much hard work goes into it and so much restoration after the floods.
"It was such a fitting thing that two years after the floods we could light the building again."
The lights were due to be switched on in November, the first time since the building was damaged by flooding in December 2013.
The total damage caused by the flooding was estimated to have cost between £250,000 and £500,000.
