Tesco's online banking operation has been restored after being hit by a computer fault, with customers unable to view their accounts.

A spokesperson for the bank said: "All customers can now see their accounts online as normal."
Customers trying to use current accounts, savings and loans - but not credit card services - were affected.
Tesco said it had not received "a huge number of calls", although thousands of accounts could have been hit.
Tesco apologised for the inconvenience caused and thanked customers for their patience.
Earlier in the week one customer who contacted the BBC said she had been unable to access her account for two days.
Tesco Bank said it had alerted customers on its website that there was a problem.
However, a spokesman told the BBC that customers could contact its call centres to process any account services while the problems continued.
The bank said: "We are aware that some of our customers are currently unable to view their accounts in online banking. We are working hard to resolve this matter as soon as possible.
"Customers can still continue to use their accounts as normal and can contact us by phone if they need any help with their account. We apologise for the inconvenience and thank customers for their patience"
