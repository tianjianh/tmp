The survey by the Channel Islands Competition and Regulatory Authorities (CICRA) found 70% of JT customers would change operator if given the choice.
CICRA has called on JT to create a plan to improve service across the island.
Tim Ringsdore, managing director, said it was serious about improving its service and customer satisfaction.

The company has also disputed the findings of the survey, which it said showed different results from its own customer survey.
Its chief executive Graeme Miller said: "Our data shows the service we are delivering to customers is steadily improving."
