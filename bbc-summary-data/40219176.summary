The 24-year-old centre-back has appeared 149 times for the Chairboys since joining from Brentford in 2014 and was offered new terms last summer.
The Buckinghamshire club also turned down a bid for Pierre last summer.
"We have tabled a new deal to Aaron and his representatives which is now left for them to consider again," boss Gareth Ainsworth told the club website.
"There is an opportunity here for him to help us achieve something next year and we would love him to be a part of that.
"Aaron is an ambitious person and wants to play at the highest possible level and we know that he will be keeping his options open."
