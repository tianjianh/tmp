Jordy Hiwula kept Walsall's League One automatic promotion hopes alive as his late winner downed mid-table Southend.

The on-loan striker headed an 88th-minute corner against the underside of the bar and, although it was cleared, the assistant referee awarded a goal.
Dan Bentley had earlier made fine saves from Romaine Sawyers, Milan Lalkovic and Hiwula to keep the scores level.
Goalkeeper Neil Etheridge saved Adam Barrett's volley to deny the visitors an injury-time equaliser.
The Saddlers are now within three points of the automatic promotion places after second-placed Burton Albion were held to a 0-0 draw by Barnsley.
With a game in hand and a slightly better goal difference over Burton, automatic promotion from League One is now back in the Saddlers' own hands.
Walsall interim head coach Jon Whitney told BBC WM:

"If I thought about how it's been over the past six weeks, I would be worn out. But I've got an energy about me. The players enthuse me.
"I always talk about this energy balance and we have to give it back. The players have to be energised and they are doing that.
"I'm just really pleased about the way we won and the way that we ground it out."
