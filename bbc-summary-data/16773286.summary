Peterborough Cathedral receives £320,000 grant

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Peterborough Cathedral's plans to build a heritage centre are a step closer after receiving a £320,900 Heritage Lottery grant.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
It is one of four projects undertaken by the cathedral in the run-up to its 900th anniversary in 2018.
The Very Reverend Charles Taylor, Dean of Peterborough, said he was delighted with this "public vote of confidence in our plans".
The Heritage and Education Centre will be based at 25 Minster Precinct.
Robyn Llewellyn, head of Heritage Lottery Fund East of England, said: "The heritage centre has the potential to provide fantastic insight into the rich and varied heritage of the cathedral and its precincts, making this fascinating story more accessible to the wider community."
The centre will also offer better facilities for the cathedral's education programme.
The cathedral plans to apply for a further Heritage Lottery grant at a later date.
