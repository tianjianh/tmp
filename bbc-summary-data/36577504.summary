The 33-year-old midfielder, whose contract was due to expire this summer, joined the west London side in 2013 and made 39 appearances last season.
"Karl is a fantastic professional," manager Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink told QPR's website.
"He is an experienced player and a leader on and off the pitch for us. He leads by example with his application and commitment."
A number of players, including Clint Hill, Alejandro Faurlin and goalkeeper Rob Green, were recently released when their contracts at Loftus Road expired.
But Henry, who was previously at Wolves and Stoke City, opted to stay after being offered new terms.
"I was happy to stay if the club wanted me to, so I'm really pleased they did," he said. "I'm very confident about the season ahead with this manager in charge."
