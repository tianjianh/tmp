Karim Benzema scored an early header from Dani Carvajal's cross and Real goalkeeper Keylor Navas saved Antoine Griezmann's penalty.
Gareth Bale, returning after injury, came on as a 66th-minute substitute for Real before Luciano Vietto scored his first Atletico goal from close range.
Real moved into second as Villarreal remained top despite losing to Levante.
Levante won 1-0 to move off the bottom of the table following a first-half sending-off for Villarreal's Bojan Jokic and Deyverson's 83rd-minute goal.
Atletico's draw extended their unbeaten run against Real in La Liga to five games.
Real coach Rafael Benitez, for whom this was a first Madrid derby, said: "We were in front and we made mistakes for the penalty and the goal."
Atletico boss Diego Simeone said: "The feeling is that we have lost two points."
Bale, 26, made little impact on his first appearance since suffering a calf problem in September, while defender Sergio Ramos also returned from injury for Real.
Cristiano Ronaldo failed to officially overtake Raul's record of 323 Real goals, although the club have already honoured the 30-year-old Portuguese forward.
Athletic Bilbao beat Valencia 3-1 at home and Real Betis won 2-0 at Rayo Vallecano.
