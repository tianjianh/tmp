Rhys Marshall opened the scoring for Glenavon before Jude Winchester and Chris Curran turned it around.
Greg Moorhouse headed the away side level only for Jay Donnelly to head Tommy Breslin's team 3-2 up.
James Singleton, James Gray and Andy McGrory scored after the break to secure a thrilling victory for Gary Hamilton's side.
A frantic tone was set early on when Marshall headed Glenavon into the lead after three minutes when he rose highest to meet Joel Cooper's corner.
The Reds responded strongly, however, first through Winchester's long-range strike, which levelled the score before Curran's excellent solo effort turned the game on its head.
Cliftonville conceded again when Moorhouse headed in from close-range to make it 2-2.
Two minutes later, Donnelly produced a fine header of his own to give the Reds a slender advantage going into the break.
Glenavon's game-plan was to bombard Cliftonville with crosses and it proved effective as Singleton made it 3-3 with a header, once again from a Cooper corner.
From then, the away side dominated and were duly rewarded, Gray scoring a close-range header to put the Mourneview Park outfit in the driving seat.
McGrory wrapped up a thrilling win from the penalty spot after a foul on Mark Sykes.
