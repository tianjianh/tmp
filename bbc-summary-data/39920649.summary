A charity fundraiser has achieved his goal of running 44 marathons on consecutive days - one in each of 44 countries.

Peter Thompson, from Bournemouth, began his challenge on 1 April in St Petersburg and finished in Dublin on Sunday.
The 32-year-old has raised almost Â£18,000 for mental health charities Livability Holton Lee and Mind.
He said travelling between countries had been a logistical nightmare.
Mr Thompson said he hoped his challenge would "encourage others to be open about mental health and, if comfortable, share their own stories".
"We all face our own issues but wouldn't it be great if everyone was able offer support instead of judgement, advice instead of avoidance, or simply a smile instead of a stare," he said.
Between each marathon he had to move from one country to the next, in "a mixture of trains, planes, buses, taxis, cars and ferries".
Along the way he said he suffered a leg injury and got fined after a bus driver refused to accept a 50 euro note.
He ate cake for breakfast some days and even found time to hand wash his running kit on occasions.
He said it had been the "best thing and the hardest thing" he had ever done.
Although he rarely had time to sit down to a proper meal he said he had consumed about 6,000 calories each day - eating mainly sandwiches and chocolate.
He praised family, friends and running clubs in various countries who had "gone out of their way" to help him, including running with him at points along the route.
