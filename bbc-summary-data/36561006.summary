[SN]TITLE[SN]
Former Wiltshire Police superintendent admits fraud and forgery charges

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A former senior police officer has admitted charges of fraud, forgery and false accounting carried out when he was treasurer of a scout group.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 11 charges relate to the period when ex-Supt Andrew Carr, 47, worked for the 7th Swindon Scouts and Orchid Vale PTA.
Funds were not paid into bank accounts, cheques were written out in another name and documents were falsified.
Carr, from Swindon, will be sentenced at Bournemouth Crown Court on 21 July.
He was dismissed from Wiltshire Police in May following a hearing held in private "to ensure it did not prejudice his criminal trial".
Carr was charged with four counts of fraud relating to the scouts and PTA where the proceeds of various fundraising events were not paid into bank accounts as required.
Two counts of theft relate to falsifying documents for accounting purposes and five counts of forgery relate to writing out cheques in another person's name.
Speaking after the case, Ch Con Mike Veale expressed his "dismay and disappointment" that Carr's behaviour fell below what was expected of a police officer.
"This is a stark reminder of the important role that police officers and staff have in our society in relation to the requirement to demonstrate the highest standards of behaviour," he said.
"I expect them to act with the utmost integrity at all times including conduct whilst on and off duty."
