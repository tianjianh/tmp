[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Rajendra Sadashiv Nikalje, also known as Chhota Rajan or "Little Rajan", is accused of multiple murders.
Nikalje was detained when he flew into Bali airport from Sydney last month.
His deportation was delayed for two days when volcanic ash from an eruption of Mount Rinjani forced the closure of Bali's main international airport.
He was taken to a military airport amid heavy security, the AFP news agency reports.
Nikalje, 55, is wanted in the western Indian city of Mumbai in connection with at least 17 cases of murder.
He is also accused of extortion and drug trafficking.
He grew up in Mumbai and reportedly became involved in petty crime as a youth before rising to lead one of the city's crime syndicates.
Indonesian police arrested him following a tip-off from officers in Australia, who say he was living there under a different name.
