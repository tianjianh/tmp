[SN]TITLE[SN]
Werder Bremen 0-2 Bayern Munich

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Robert Lewandowski scored twice in the last 20 minutes as Bayern Munich beat Werder Bremen for a second win from their first two Bundesliga games.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Summer signing Corentin Tolisso hit the crossbar early on for the five-times-in-a-row German champions.
The opener came when Poland star Lewandowski backheeled Kingsley Coman's cross into the net.
And he scored his sixth goal in four games this season when he put a shot between the Werder keeper's legs.
Bayern goalkeeper Manuel Neuer kept a clean sheet on his return from a broken foot which forced him to miss the last month of last season.
Thomas Muller - who came on in the 73rd minute and had a hand in Lewandowski's second - was unhappy at not starting.
"Well, I don't really know what the qualities are that the coach [Carlo Ancelotti] wants to see. Obviously mine do not seem to be in 100% demand."
Elsewhere, former Bayern defender Holger Badstuber scored only the second Bundesliga goal of his career as Stuttgart beat Mainz 1-0.
