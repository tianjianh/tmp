Ipswich Town 0-1 Sheffield Wednesday

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Sheffield Wednesday confirmed their place in the Championship play-offs with victory at Ipswich.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Owls' sixth straight win ensured they cannot be caught by their Yorkshire rivals Leeds who sit seventh.
Ross Wallace's drive had already hit the post before Kieran Lee put Wednesday in front with a deft finish from Daniel Pudil's cross.
David McGoldrick went closest for Town when his angled drive was clawed away by Keiren Westwood.
The Owls bossed possession in the first half and had more attempts on goal, but Town, who were unbeaten in seven home matches, forced the only saves with leading scorer Tom Lawrence also shooting straight at Westwood.
Mick McCarthy had never lost a league game against Sheffield Wednesday in 14 meetings, and it looked like that record would continue until Lee finished off a lovely flowing move late on.
Wednesday, who go into the play-offs as the Championship's form team, also saw Steven Fletcher force a save from Bartosz Bialkowski in a tight game, while Emyr Huws side-footed a good chance over the bar at the other end.
The Owls, who could set a new club-record points haul in a second-tier season with victory in their final game, moved up a place to fourth, while Ipswich remain 16th.
Ipswich manager Mick McCarthy:
"We haven't been good enough at home and we haven't entertained our fans enough so I do understand that [reaction at the end].
"It is a shame we didn't go out on a high but I think they had the edge on us and just had that bit more quality.
"We wanted the result and to play for pride but Wednesday still had something to play for. They are wired for the play-offs and they came here with real momentum and form and it showed."
Sheffield Wednesday manager Carlos Carvalhal:
"We prepare very well for the games and this is a result of a lot of hard work. Six wins in a row is fantastic - that is something very special.
"We deserved to win today. It gives me satisfaction to see people around me happy - the chairman, the players and the fans.
"We have more points than we had last season and we are dealing with the expectations of our fans.
"This is a massive club but we can only look at ourselves. I will not think about who we might have in the semi-final or whether we might start home or away in the play-offs."
