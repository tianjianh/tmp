[SN]TITLE[SN]
Northampton Town 1-1 Fleetwood Town

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Victor Nirennold earned Fleetwood a deserved point from a 1-1 draw at Northampton on the opening day of the League One season.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Last season's runaway League Two champions Northampton took just nine minutes to open their account in the third tier. When David Buchanan's shot was only partially cleared, Alex Revell's effort hit the upright and the ball bounced into the net off the diving Chris Neal.
Fleetwood found it difficult to create openings but the lively David Ball had a deflected shot saved by Adam Smith before shooting into the side-netting from a tight angle.
The Cobblers went close when Matt Taylor's free-kick caused problems at the far post and Revell's close-range effort was cleared off the line by Amari'i Bell.
Northampton should have increased their lead just before the interval when Kenji Gorre volleyed over from six yards from Harry Beautyman's pinpoint cross.
But Fleetwood were back on level terms seven minutes after the restart when Northampton failed to deal with Conor McLaughlin's cross and Nirennold stole in at the far post to score.
The Cobblers went close straight from the restart when Zander Diamond turned Taylor's free-kick over the bar from close range and Marc Richards fired straight at Neal.
At the other end Ball's shot on the turn was saved by Adam Smith as Fleetwood got on top. Richards should have restored Northampton's lead when he shot weakly at Neal while Fleetwood's Eggert Jonsson volley from the edge of the box flew wide.
