[SN]TITLE[SN]
Wigan Athletic 0-0 Preston North End

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Matt Gilks saved a penalty on his home debut to earn relegation-threatened Wigan Athletic a point against Preston.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Goalkeeper Gilks produced a stunning double save to keep out Jordan Hugill after Omar Bogle's foul on Callum Robinson gave Preston an early penalty.
Wigan struggled to create chances with Bogle denied a one-on-one opportunity by Greg Cunningham's well-timed tackle.
The draw keeps the Latics 22nd in the Championship, two points from safety, while Preston remain 10th.
Gilks only signed an 18-month deal on January's transfer deadline day, but already has two Championship clean sheets in three appearances.
It was nearly a terrible start from Wigan, who were indebted to their new recruit after the 34-year-old keeper twice kept out Hugill just 10 minutes into his first game at the DW Stadium.
The former Blackpool stopper made a diving save from the spot-kick, before springing up to keep out the North End striker's attempt from the rebound.
Wigan's Callum Connolly dragged two shots wide of the target in a first half low on chances before the Latics' Max Power and Preston's Jermaine Beckford tried long-range attempts, but both shot way over the bar.
Warren Joyce's side had found the net in five of their last six matches in the league, but could not break the visitors down as they made it a league-high 15 Championship matches without a goal.
Wigan manager Warren Joyce:
"It was a hard-fought game - not a lot of clear-cut chances, a lot of effort, endeavour, commitment, fight.
"Probably it was a fair result on the day. There was a lot of good defending in there from both teams."
Preston boss Simon Grayson:
"We need to give Wigan a lot of credit as they worked very hard - they pressed and worked us, and we didn't have that quality in the final third that we've had in the last few games.
"That comes with the pitch being difficult, three games in a week, and we chopped and changed it to get something out of the game."
