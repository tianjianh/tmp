The visitors had a goal disallowed in the first half when Stina Blackstenius' header was ruled out for offside.
Gilly Flaherty then tripped Lotta Schelin in the area but Chamberlain saved Kosovare Asllani's penalty.
England manager Mark Sampson had made 10 changes to the side that lost to Norway on Sunday.
The Lionesses looked sharp and enjoyed good passages of play but found clear-cut chances hard to come by against the Rio Olympics silver medallists.
England's best effort fell to captain on the night Jordan Nobbs, whose powerful shot from the edge of the area curled just wide of the post.
As expected with Women's Super League clubs only returning to training two weeks ago, Sampson made wholesale changes to the team, with only Chamberlain retaining her place.
The Liverpool goalkeeper once again impressed, making a string of quick reaction saves from close range as well parrying away the late penalty.
In her first England appearance in almost four years, Rachel Williams dominated the midfield, winning challenges all over the pitch.
The Notts County player, who also works as a plasterer, displayed power and strength across the 90 minutes.
With usual skipper Steph Houghton starting on the bench, Nobbs led the side and the Arsenal midfielder distributed the ball well under pressure.
And Chelsea's Millie Bright defended bravely on her first senior England start.
England now have a five-week break before they take part in the SheBelieves Cup in the United States.
They will take on the three top-ranked teams in the world; USA, Germany and France.
England face France in their opener on 1 March in Pennsylvania.
They then face the hosts in New Jersey on 4 March and European champions Germany in Washington on 7 March.
Following that, Sampson's squad are expected to play several other friendlies before their Euro 2017 campaign gets under way against Scotland on 19 July in the Netherlands.
In the meantime, the Women's Super League Spring series begins in April.
