A 22-year-old woman is also in a critical condition at the Queen's Medical Centre in Nottingham after the single-vehicle crash on the Kilbourne Road in Belper.
A police spokesman said: "A blue Fiat Panda was involved in a collision and two people received fatal injuries."
The two victims died at the scene at about 01:25 BST.
"Kilbourne Road has now reopened and anyone with information on the collision or who has dash-cam footage is asked to contact us," the spokesman added.
Tom Reith, who lives on Kilbourne Road, said he was woken up by the accident and saw the wreckage.
He said: "It was horrendous, terrible. Our thoughts and prayers go out to the family."
