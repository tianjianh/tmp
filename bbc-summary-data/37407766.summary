[SN]TITLE[SN]
Jo Cox: No medical evidence to be heard in murder trial

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Medical issues will not be part of the trial of the man accused of murdering Labour MP Jo Cox.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Thomas Mair, 53, is accused of shooting and stabbing Mrs Cox, 41, in Birstall, near Leeds, on June 16.
He is also charged with grievous bodily harm, possession of a firearm with intent to commit an indictable offence and possession of an offensive weapon.
At the Old Bailey in London, the court heard Mr Mair's health would not be part of the defence.
He was due to appear via video link from Belmarsh jail, but his barrister gave permission for the brief hearing to be held in his absence because the link wasn't working.
Mr Mair, from Birstall, is being held in custody and is due to appear at the same court on 4 October.
