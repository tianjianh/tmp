The future of a Welsh medium primary school in London has been secured after an agreement was reached to move it.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
London Welsh School will move from Wembley and relocate to the nearby Hanwell Community Centre after Brent Council decided to close the site.
The school's 30 pupils will be in the new building for the start of the school year in September.
Chairwoman of governors, Eleri Brady, said: "We are delighted that the future of the school is safe."
The school had to leave the current site by the end of the summer term under plans to expand the nearby Stonebridge school.
It has also had confirmation from the Welsh government that it can receive full funding for the next three years.
Ms Brady told BBC Wales' Welsh language news website Cymru Fyw: "Hopefully this will be an opportunity to attract new families from west London."
