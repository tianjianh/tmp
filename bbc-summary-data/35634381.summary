Two in court over fatal tipper truck crash in Bath

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Two men charged in connection with a tipper truck crash that killed four people in Bath have appeared in court.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Phillip Potter, 19, and Matthew Gordon, 29, face a total of nine charges relating to the crash last February.
Mitzi Steady, four, from Bath, Robert Parker, 59, from Cwmbran, Phil Allen, 52, and Stephen Vaughan, 34, both from Swansea, were all killed in the crash.
A trial is likely to take place later in the year and is expected to last four weeks, Bristol Crown Court heard.
Mitzi was walking with her grandmother on Lansdown Lane in Bath when she was hit by the Scania truck carrying aggregate.
It went on to hit a number of vehicles on the road before overturning on to a Volvo at the bottom of the hill, killing the three other victims.
Mr Potter, of Little Middle Green Farm, Dauntsey, Wiltshire, faces two counts of causing death by dangerous driving and two counts of causing serious injury by dangerous driving.
It is alleged he was driving the HGV tipper truck "dangerously" from an access road to Shorncote Quarry, along the Spine Road, on the M4, on the A46, the A420, Freezing Lane and Lansdown Lane.
Mr Gordon, of Chestnut Farm, Dauntsey, faces charges of aiding or abetting and one count of dangerous driving.
The two defendants did not enter pleas to the charges against them at the preliminary hearing and were released on unconditional bail.
The next hearing is likely to take place in June.
