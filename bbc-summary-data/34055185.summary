[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Jonathan Kovacik was found guilty of unlawfully wounding Rosalynde Pitcher after she told him they were not going to have a long term relationship.
A jury at Portsmouth Crown Court heard how Kovacik, 58, from Shanklin on the Isle of Wight, shot the 21-year-old in the temple with a pellet.
But he was cleared of the more serious offence of wounding with intent.
Kovacik was also found guilty of having an article with a blade or point and possessing an air gun with intent to cause fear of violence.
He was sentenced by Judge Rodger Hetherington earlier after a jury found him guilty on Monday following more than three hours of deliberations
Kovacik told the court he had fallen in love with Ms Pitcher and promised to give her Â£50,000 if she stopped taking drugs and working in the sex industry.
He also gave her Â£6,000 to pay for a breast enlargement operation.
On 20 December he said he went to see Ms Pitcher and found her with another man.
He said he took an air pistol and a knife for self-defence, because he was scared her father would be there.
Kovacik told the jury he did not remember what happened next, but recalls driving away in his car and calling police with the aim of taking his own life by being shot.
