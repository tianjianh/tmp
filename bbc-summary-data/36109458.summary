Tyrone Clarke, 16, was attacked by a 20-strong gang in Beeston on 22 April 2004.
Although four people were later convicted of murder, police said a "large number" of people were involved and the case remains active.
Lorraine Fraser, Tyrone's mother, said they had "got away with murder".
Speaking on the anniversary of his death, she said her "nightmare" can only end when the people involved come forward.
"I don't know who stabbed my son. There was over 20 people there that day, but somebody did," she said.
"There were more involved than the four who were prosecuted. People got away with murder that day."

Tyrone Clarke was stabbed in the suburb's Brett Gardens after he had been chased by the gang.
He was attacked with weapons including metal poles, planks of wood and CS spray.
Three men and a 17-year-old boy were convicted of murder in 2005 and jailed for life.
A fifth suspect, Qasim Majid, fled to Pakistan and remains wanted by police.
Ms Fraser said: "It is a nightmare, its hell. It never goes away.
"The images I saw that day of my own son laid out dying in the street. They never leave me. I have to live with that every day.
"I need some closure. I want to grieve properly, but I can't because I know there are people out there who have evaded justice."
West Yorkshire Police said the force remained committed to finding the remaining suspects.
