Donald Trump: No citizenship for illegal migrants' babies

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump says he wants to end the automatic right to citizenship for all children born in the United States.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
All children born in the US - even if their parents are illegal immigrants - get citizenship under the constitution.
Other measures he outlined would include raising visa fees to pay for a wall along the Mexican border.
Immigration is a central plank of Mr Trump's campaign to be the Republican contender in next year's election.
"They have to go," he told NBC.
A tough deportation policy was needed, he said, because "there's definitely evidence" of crimes linked to immigrants living in the country illegally.
Mr Trump - a front-runner in the field of Republican candidates - said he would also deport all undocumented immigrants, and pay for a tripling of the number of immigration officers by eliminating tax credit payments to immigrant families residing illegally in the US.
He added families with US-born children could return quickly if deemed worthy by the government.
"We're going to try and bring them back rapidly, the good ones," he said, adding: "We will expedite it so people can come back in.
"The good people can come back," he said, without elaborating.
