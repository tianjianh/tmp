Jak McCourt: Northampton Town midfielder needs shoulder surgery

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Northampton Town midfielder Jak McCourt will be out for "a couple of months" because he needs shoulder surgery.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 21-year-old joined the League One side on a two-year contract this summer following his release by Barnsley.
But he injured himself in a pre-season friendly against Nuneaton on Tuesday and although X-rays revealed no broken bones, he needs an operation to reduce the chances of the injury recurring.
"I am gutted for the lad," manager Rob Page told the club website.
"It was one of those things, it wasn't anyone's fault, it was an impact injury and all we can do now is work with Jak to get him fit and ready as soon as possible."
