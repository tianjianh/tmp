Samoa international Stanley, 27, joined Quins from Highlanders last summer but injury restricted him to just eight appearances last season.
Walker, 23, has scored 23 tries in 52 appearances for the Premiership club since making his senior debut in 2011.
"These two talented and valued backs have major roles to play," director of rugby John Kingston said.
Harlequins have not disclosed the length of the duo's new deals at the Twickenham Stoop.
