The 20-year-old has made one City appearance in the FA Cup and spent last season with Dutch club NAC Breda.
"He is a player that I have admired for a long, long time," said Hibs boss Neil Lennon. "He is a very exciting young player.
"When I was manager at Bolton I went to see him on a couple of occasions and I was really impressed."
Barker, capped by England at youth level, could be included in the squad for Saturday's home game with Hamilton.
"The manager said that it is a good place for me to come and carry on learning my trade and that it is a great platform for me to come and show everyone what I can do," he said.
"He believes in me, so hopefully I can make everyone else believe in me."
