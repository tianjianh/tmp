Rangers manager Pedro Caixinha has vowed to crack down on leaks from inside the Ibrox dressing room.

The Portuguese has been unhappy with several stories about his first-team squad emerging in the media.
The latest concerned defenders Philippe Senderos and Clint Hill, who will not be offered new deals.
"We need to identify [who is leaking] and then seal it. We are a big club and a big club cannot have this sort of behaviour," Caixinha said.
'No leaks, no leaks'
"We are ruled and managed from inside out - but our way, not the other way around," added the Rangers boss. "When I stay here, that is the way we are going to behave and work.
"No leaks, no leaks. That is a point we definitely need to understand.
"[The leaks] are not destabilising for myself. It's something I don't like but I keep doing my job."
Caixinha took charge of Rangers six weeks ago, following the departure of Mark Warburton.
The 46-year-old has managed in Qatar, Mexico, and his native Portugal, where he assisted then-Sporting Lisbon boss Jose Peseiro between 2004 and 2006.
"I found when I was working at Sporting Lisbon that things came out easy," Caixinha added. "Benfica rules Portuguese football nowadays. But back then it was Porto.
"I can tell you something - nothing comes out from Benfica unless they want it to be known. That is why they are successful.
"With Porto in those days, I used to remember they had a president who said when players were coming in or moving, 'If something appeared in a newspaper and I'm dealing with you, our deal is done. I'm not dealing with you'.
"I found that a very good principle and they were successful. I try to follow successful people, not the opposite."
