[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Police officers who deliberately ran over and killed a dog on a dual carriageway caused almost £1,600 worth of damage to their car.

North Wales Police revealed under a Freedom of Information request the repair bill was £1,561.48.
The foxhound was loose on the A55 in Conwy county in February and North Wales Police said the "only safe option" was to run it over and kill it.
The matter has been referred to the police watchdog.
Traffic police drove at the animal on the dual carriageway between Llanfairfechan roundabout and the Conwy tunnel.
Police said the dog's owner was "devastated" but agreed officers had made the right decision.
Firearms officers were sent to the scene, but there were concerns they would not be able to get a safe shot at the dog, which had gone missing from a hunt.
Independent Police Complaints Commissioner Jan Williams said at the time: "We recognise the public concern arising from the incident where a dog was destroyed on the A55 earlier this week.
"After careful consideration of a referral from North Wales Police, we have determined that the force should continue with its own investigation."
