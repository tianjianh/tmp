Ulster Rugby have announced that they will erect a memorial to Anthony Foley in the away changing room at Kingspan Stadium.

The 42-year-old Munster head coach died suddenly in Paris on Saturday ahead of a European Champions Cup game.
It is a reciprocal gesture following the death of Ulster player Nevin Spence in 2012.
Munster erected a plaque commemorating Spence at Thomond Park, their home ground in Limerick.
It has not been confirmed what form of memorial will be made by Ulster.
"Anthony Foley was a magnificent rugby player and a magnificent human being," said Ulster CEO Shane Logan.
"We extend our condolences to his family and all in Munster rugby.
"Munster were superb when Nevin Spence died - they did us the great tribute of placing a permanent memorial to Nevin in their away changing room.
"We would like to reciprocate for Munster."
Munster's European Champions Cup game against Racing 92 was postponed following the former Ireland international's death.

Foley captained Munster to Heineken Cup success in 2006 and won 62 caps for Ireland.
He was forwards coach with Munster, and for a short period in 2012 with Ireland, before becoming head coach of the Irish province in 2014.
Ulster director of rugby Les Kiss worked with Foley during their respective backroom stints with the Ireland squad.
"It's a hard thing to sink in. Axel Foley, a legend of Munster and Irish rugby," said Kiss.
"A good friend and great coach. I loved working with him. To think I'm not going to see you again is surreal. I can't believe it."
Ulster centre Spence was just 22 when he died in a farming accident along with his father and brother.
