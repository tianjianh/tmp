Sir Nicholas Winton's treasures to be auctioned

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Items that once belonged to Kindertransport hero Sir Nicholas Winton, including a 105th birthday message from the Queen, are to be sold at auction.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Sir Nicholas, who died last year aged 106, brought Jewish children from Nazi-occupied Czechoslovakia to the UK.
The Winton family are currently in the process of selling his estate, including his house in Maidenhead.
His son, Nick Winton, said it was "difficult" to decide what to let go.
"The reality is, over his life he has accumulated many objects," he added.
"If I won the lottery and had the space there are a lot of things I would love to keep in the family, but it just isn't practical."
Items up for auction include a framed picture of Sir Nicholas meeting then US President Bill Clinton in 1995, and a Napoleon III writing desk made in Paris and bought by Sir Nicholas for his wife, Grete.
The auction is being held at the Swan Auction House in Tetsworth, Oxfordshire on 3 November.
In 1939 Sir Nicholas organised the rescue of 669 Jewish children destined for Nazi concentration camps, arranging for trains to carry them out of German-occupied Prague to the sanctuary of the UK.
