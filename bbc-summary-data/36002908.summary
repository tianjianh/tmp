Defender Michael Hector gave the Royals the lead at the break with a back post half-volley but Toumani Diagouraga's header brought the Whites level.
Wood's header from four yards out saw Leeds take the lead before Deniss Rakels' close-range strike equalised.
Leeds striker Wood then clinched all three points when he finished past Ali Al Habsi five minutes from time.
A group of Leeds supporters held a protest against chairman Massimo Cellino's ownership before the game and with both sides sitting safely in mid-table in the Championship and having little to play for, the match could have meandered into a dreary affair.
An early fumble by Reading captain Al Habsi forced Jake Cooper into an excellent goalline clearance as the game came to life before the half-hour mark.
The game featured a first Championship goal of the season for Hector and Diagouraga's first at this level, while Rakels netted his second goal of the season.
However, the afternoon belonged to 24-year-old Wood, whose 10th and 11th goals of the campaign ensured it was an unhappy return for Royals manager Brian McDermott to his former club.
Leeds head coach Steve Evans:
"At the moment I am fully focused on our next two games against Wolves and Hull.
"I have never made any secret of the fact that I want to be Leeds' head coach next term.
"In life we would all like decisions to be made quickly but when I asked my wife to marry me she took forever!
"The president (Massimo Cellino) will meet me for talks when he is ready."
Reading manager Brian McDermott:
"The Leeds fans are genuine, good people and Leeds United is a fantastic football club. Apart from the result, I enjoyed being back.
"We have a very young team and they will learn from playing in this environment.
"In the first half we were good value and maybe could have been two goals up, but we didn't come out for the second half as well as we should have done.
"We have more points than last season, so that is a positive sign. We need to improve results away from home and do the ugly stuff well"
