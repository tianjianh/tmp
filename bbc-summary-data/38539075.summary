Ipswich Town 3-2 Blackburn Rovers

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Tom Lawrence took his tally to five goals in three games as Ipswich Town overcame Championship strugglers Blackburn Rovers at Portman Road.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Lawrence put the hosts ahead with a free-kick before Hope Akpan levelled.
Christophe Berra's close-range finish restored Town's lead and Lawrence made it 3-1 with a superb 30-yard strike.
Danny Graham pulled a goal back from the penalty spot after Akpan was brought down by Adam Webster, but Rovers could not find a late equaliser.
Defeat leaves Owen Coyle's Blackburn side one point and one place adrift of safety after 26 games, while the victory lifts Ipswich two places up to 14th in the table.
In a bright start by the hosts, Freddie Sears twice called Rovers goalkeeper Jason Steele into action, while at the other end Sam Gallagher was menacing, with Bartosz Bialkowski denying the forward in a one-on-one.
Lawrence then squeezed a free-kick under Steele for the opening goal, only for Akpan to respond before half-time, meeting a cut-back pass from Graham to level just before the break,
A Lawrence corner led to Berra's goal and the 23-year-old, on loan from Leicester City, added a tremendous third before Graham gave the visitors late hope in an entertaining game.
Following the match, Town boss Mick McCarthy also revealed that the Championship club had signed 24-year-old striker Kieffer Moore from National League side Forest Green on an 18-month deal.
Ipswich Town manager Mick McCarthy:
"Tom [Lawrence] is flying at the minute and he should rejoice in the fact that he is playing as well as he is in a struggling side.
"He has been carrying us with his performances and goals and he will have plenty of options in the summer. He should just enjoy his football at the minute and the rewards will come by playing like that.
"There has been some doom and gloom which comes with not winning games and not playing well. But I thought we put in a good performance and should have won more comfortably."
Blackburn Rovers boss Owen Coyle:
"I thought we were cutting out the individual errors, but the goals we gave away were cheap and avoidable, although Tom Lawrence's was a contender for goal of the season.
"We now have a run of home games to move ourselves up the league."
