The 24-year-old man died at the scene after a "short pursuit" in Old Trafford, at about 03:28 GMT Greater Manchester Police (GMP) said.
The Mercedes S320 he was driving "made off from the patrol car at speed".
It struck a Mini at the junction of Chester Road and Sir Matt Busby Way before hitting a barrier. Two women in the Mini sustained multiple injuries.
Supt Jen Williams of GMP's Professional Standards Branch said it was "investigating this incident to establish the full circumstances surrounding the collision".
The crash was a mandatory referral to the police watchdog,  Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC).
In a statement the IPCC said: "[Our] investigators have already begun to collect evidence relating to the collision, including taking initial accounts from the officers involved, gathering CCTV footage, and retrieving the data recorder from the police vehicle."
