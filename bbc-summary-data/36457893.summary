The former RAF aircraft was leaving a runway at Brimpton Airfield near Reading on Sunday when it descended shortly after becoming airborne, crashing into parked cars.
The 60-year-old woman, believed to be sitting on the ground, was taken to hospital with serious facial injuries.
The pilot and his male passenger suffered minor injuries.
Chris Wheeler, social secretary for Brimpton Flying Club, said about 100 spectators were at the event to raise money for Thames Valley Air Ambulance.
"We are not yet aware of the cause but the aircraft had an accident on take-off and collided with two cars.
"Unfortunately one of the occupants was sitting on the ground between the two cars and she got hit by bits of the propellers which disintegrated on impact.
"Although she is badly hurt we believe she is not in a critical condition."
The pilot and his passenger were treated at the scene.
An investigation by the Air Accident Investigation Branch is being carried out.
