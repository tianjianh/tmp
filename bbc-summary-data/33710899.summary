Liam Miller, 20, from Terrington, near Malton, was found at a house in Hamilton Drive at about 10:20 BST on Monday.
He was taken to hospital but died from his injuries. A second man, in his fifties, was also injured in the incident.
A 19-year-old man who was arrested at the scene remains in hospital.
Mr Miller's family said in a statement: "We are absolutely devastated by Liam's untimely death. We cannot put into words the shock and disbelief we feel about what has happened.
"Liam was just 20 years old and had his whole life ahead of him. We will miss him more than words can say."
Mr Miller had returned home for the summer from Liverpool John Moores University where he was studying graphic design and illustration.
Police said they were treating the attack on the second man, who went to Mr Miller's assistance, as attempted murder.
Det Insp Mark Pearson said: "We know from our enquiries that the second victim, a local man in his fifties, was chased along Hamilton Drive West where he was stabbed close to the junction with Lady Hamilton Gardens.
"We know that the man desperately tried to flag down passing motorists for assistance and we are appealing for those motorists to contact us."
