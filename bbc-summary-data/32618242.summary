No FAI for Aberdeen burns death boy Preston Flores

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
No Fatal Accident Inquiry will be held into the death of a seven-year-old boy from burns in Aberdeen, BBC Scotland has learned.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Preston Flores was seriously burned in an incident in Bedford Avenue in April last year, which was believed to have involved petrol.
He was transferred to a hospital in Edinburgh where he later died.
The Crown said it was satisfied the cause of his death had been established, and no FAI was needed.
A spokesman for the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service said: "Following careful consideration of all the factors involved in this case, independent Crown Counsel is satisfied that the cause of the death has been established and has decided not to hold a Fatal Accident Inquiry.
"The family have been advised of the result of our investigation."
