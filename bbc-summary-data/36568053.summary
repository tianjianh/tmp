After a slow start, which saw Maria Granatto give Argentina the lead in the opening quarter, GB equalised through Helen Richardson-Walsh.
A stunning Carla Rebecchi penalty corner put the visitors ahead before Richardson-Walsh struck her second.
"It was good from the team to fight back twice," said Richardson-Walsh.
"With how we played, a draw was probably a fair result."
The London Champions Trophy, which features six of the top seven sides in the world, is the final major international competition before the Rio Olympics in August.
GB head coach Danny Kerry hopes his team's performances improve throughout the week.
"It was too tentative and too many people were not on script," he told BBC Sport.
"I don't know if it was nerves, but we showed good qualities despite that to find a way back and we're in the tournament but we know we can play better."
Britain's display was disjointed in the early stages and Argentina deserved their seventh-minute lead.
GB improved in the second period, with Richardson-Walsh stroking home from close range after good build-up play by both herself and Susanna Townsend.
Rebecchi's breathtaking penalty corner strike in the third period came when GB were building momentum, but the hosts again equalised.
Sam Quek's powerful drive from midfield found Richardson-Walsh, whose deftest of touches deflected the ball into the goal.
After facing the world number two side, GB's tough opening to the tournament continues with a match against Olympic champions and favourites the Netherlands on Sunday.
"It's an honour to play here in front of a home crowd," said Alex Danson.
"There's a focus on the Olympics, but this is a huge event in its own right and we're going to bring another big performance out tomorrow."
