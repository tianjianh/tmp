Laurie made his name in the US for his award-winning lead role in the medical drama House between 2004 and 2012.
Long-time collaborator Stephen Fry was guest speaker at the Pig 'n Whistle British pub on Hollywood Boulevard.
Laurie joins Britons including Emma Thompson, Colin Firth, Sir Ridley Scott and Dame Helen Mirren to have stars.
His star is number 2,593 on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.
Laurie became TV's highest-paid actor and won Golden Globe awards in 2006 and 2007 for his portrayal of doctor Gregory House.
The 57-year-old from Oxford was already well-known in Britain for his TV sketch show with Fry, and other series such as Blackadder and Jeeves and Wooster.
More recently he starred opposite Tom Hiddleston in BBC drama The Night Manager.
Laurie said: "This is not a fair world. I'm 57 now and I've lived a life of extraordinary good fortune from start to finish, so much so I'm anticipating a piano falling on my head to redress the balance.
"I've been incredibly lucky. I'm going to bask in this extraordinary honour and my extraordinary good luck and I'll set to work first thing tomorrow on the global unfairness problem."
Fry paid tribute to his former comedy partner, saying: "While he may not be the first wise and kind star to be set in a paving slab in old Hollywood, I venture to suggest no star was ever wiser or kinder.
"I can say like Doctor Watson of his friend Holmes, the kindest and wisest friend I ever knew."
