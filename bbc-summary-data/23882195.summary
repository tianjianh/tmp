Nisbet the eland was born at Blair Drummond Safari Park near Stirling to parents Limba and Bud on 6 August.
It is the first time in 25 years that an eland, the largest species of antelope, has been born at the safari park.
She has been named after Scottish international high jumper Jayne Nisbet on account of the eland's jumping skills.
Park manager Gary Gilmour said: "She is very lively, especially in the mornings.
"She was a bit of a handful when we first let her out in the main reserve, as she seems to have no fear of other antelope or even the rhinos, but mum and dad have been keeping a close eye on her and have been keeping her out of trouble.
"Although she may be a bit small just now, she still has a bit of growing to do and will grow up to 5ft (1.52) at her shoulder and can weigh up to 500kg (1102 lbs)."
While their weight makes them one of the slowest animals, elands are able to jump over an 8ft (2.43m) fence from a standstill.
The animals were once widespread across southern, central and east Africa but are now extinct in many areas.
