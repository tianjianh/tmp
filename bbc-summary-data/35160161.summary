Piotr Sobczyk, 27 of Trulock Road, was sentenced to life imprisonment at the Old Bailey.
He was told he would serve a minimum of 16 and a half years after being previously found guilty of killing six-month-old Oskar Sobczyk in January.
Det Insp Julie Willats, said: "We will never really know what happened that day" as the pair were home alone.
Speaking after sentencing she said "Only Sobczyk and his six-month-old son were inside the family home.
"But it is believed Sobczyk violently shook and assaulted Oskar in an outburst of rage, causing catastrophic injuries from which the baby had no hope of recovery."
At about 13:45 GMT on 23 January police and ambulance crews were called by Sobczyk to the family home to reports the baby was unresponsive.
He was found pale and lifeless, lying on the sofa in cardiac arrest and was eventually pronounced dead in hospital three days later.
Post-mortem tests showed he died from a head injury and also had older injuries to his left arm.
