A community bid to take over a former church in Edinburgh has been given the green light by the Scottish government.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The former Portobello Old Parish Church in Bellfield Street is set to become the first urban community buy-out under new legislation.
Locals want to turn the church into a multi-purpose community hub for clubs such as Scouts and Brownies.
The government has agreed the project is of community benefit and given it first option to buy the building.
The community now needs to come up with the market value of the building.
One estimate for the value of the property has been put at Â£600,000, however the community is hoping it will be lower than that.
The community hope to get an 80% grant from the Scottish Land Fund and the rest from fundraising.
The community has set up a company called Action Porty to carry through the buy-out.
Spokeswoman Kyrsta Macdonald-Scott said: "We are delighted that the Scottish government have decided that our community right-to-buy application is in the best interests of our community.
"We are excited to be looking forward, progressing with raising the funds to make it happen and sharing ideas for the future of Bellfield inspired by our consultation with the community.
"We will be holding a meeting mid-November to present the options to the Action Porty members."
Land Reform Secretary Roseanna Cunningham said: "This is the first successful registration by an urban group under our revised community right to buy legislation and so is quite a significant milestone in the Scottish government's plan to see our communities have more influence in their areas.
A Church of Scotland spokeswoman said: "It is encouraging to see that urban communities like Action Porty are now taking advantage of the changes in legislation, to open up new opportunities to take greater control of their own future.
"Now the government has given the go-ahead to Action Porty we will await with interest the results of their fundraising efforts.
"The trustees are required to seek proper market value for the property as the proceeds of the sale will all go to benefit a local charity - the Portobello and Joppa congregation."
