The Planet Express crew from the 31st century is scheduled to touch down in present-day Springfield on 9 November in an episode called Simpsorama.
The main voice cast from the now cancelled Futurama will return.
In the episode Bender travels back in time to stop Bart from doing something that leads to a catastrophe.
"Bender has to come back from the future to kill Bart because there's something that Bart does now that makes the future really, really, really bad," says Simpsons executive producer Al Jean.
Speaking at the announcement of the crossover last year Jean said: "Futurama is such an easy fit.
"It's really funny, and their show lends itself to any variety of plot lines. By having them on, we have a little freedom.
"We do a joke, actually, about how similar Bender and Homer look. Like, they just erased Homer's hair."
And there's a special hidden treat for fans of both shows in the title sequence.
"There's a thing in Futurama code where if you solve it, it says, 'Congratulations! You're a nerd,'" says Jean.
It's the second crossover episode of the year that involves The Simpsons after the Griffin family from Family Guy were sent to Springfield.
The episode will premiere on Fox on 9 November.
