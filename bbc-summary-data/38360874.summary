[SN]TITLE[SN]
Leyton Orient 3-2 Crawley Town

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Leyton Orient held off a brave Crawley Town fightback to secure a Boxing Day win at Brisbane Road.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Paul McCallum's brace and a Sam Dalby effort gave the home side a three-goal half-time lead before an own goal from Teddy Mezague and an opportunist effort by Enzio Boldewijn left Orient hanging on nervously.
Teenage striker Dalby started the goal-fest with his first touch of the game. The forward, who turned 17 only 10 days ago, marked his first start for the O's by running on to Gavin Massey's fourth-minute cross to net from close range.
Seven minutes later Massey turned provider when his centre from the right was seized upon by McCallum, who turned the ball past Crawley's former Orient goalkeeper Glenn Morris.
The home side totally dictated matters in the opening half and McCallum extended the lead in added time from the penalty spot after the influential Massey had been felled in the penalty area.
Orient defender Mezague, making his first start for the club, sliced the ball into his own net on 54 minutes to reduce the deficit.
That goal produced a spirited response from the visitors, who were rewarded for their efforts when Boldewijn capitalised on an error in the home defence to set up a nervy finish.
