It was alleged they had attacked a woman, 20, after an end of term party at the Royal Agricultural University in Gloucestershire, in 2014.
The men, three of whom were students, denied the charges made against them.
A trial was due to start two weeks ago but prosecutors have now decided not to proceed with the case against the men.
All four made no comment as they left Gloucester Crown Court after not guilty verdicts were recorded.
Earlier, prosecutor Fiona Elder told the court a decision had been made not to offer any evidence against the four.
"The decision was made that there was no longer a reasonable prospect of conviction and therefore in the circumstances it was not for the Crown to pursue this case to trial," she said.
"The police were informed and discussed the decision with the head of the South West Rape and Serious Sexual Offences unit.
"The head of the South West Rape and Serious Sexual Offences unit consulted with the complainant and her family to ensure they knew and understood the decision, whatever their view of it."
