Candace Payne didn't plan on buying the Chewbacca mask when she went to her local department store in Texas.
The wannabe wookie then filmed herself trying on a Chewbacca mask and became the highest viewed video on new Facebook Live video platform ever.
She doesn't even consider herself a huge Star Wars fan...
