Most of the victims died in the province of Buenos Aires, where winds reached speeds of more than 100km (60 miles) an hour, toppling trees and causing roofs to cave in.
A teenager was electrocuted in the city of Santa Fe, in the north-east, when he stepped on a downed power cable.
Many neighbourhoods in the capital, Buenos Aires, were left without power as cables snapped in the strong winds.
Residents said unseasonably hot and humid weather gave way to the violent storm.
Some local media reported squalls of up to 120km (75 miles) an hour.
City streets were blocked by fallen trees and masonry blown off roofs.
Ten people were injured when the roof of a church was lifted by the strong winds and fell onto passengers waiting for a bus some 40m (40 yards) along the road.
Most of the casualties were crushed by fallen trees and masonry, while others were electrocuted by downed power cables.
Buenos Aires city official Diego Santilli said the storm felt like a tornado and described it as "an inferno".
He said clean-up crews were clearing the streets of the debris and restoring power to cut-off areas.
