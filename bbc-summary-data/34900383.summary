Argument over BBC control rumbles on

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Between 2000 and 2002, politicians summoned BBC managers to select committees on five occasions. Between 2013 and 2015, that number was 36.

The BBC's director general, Lord Hall, believes there has been a gradual erosion of the corporation's political independence.
His speech to the Cardiff Business Club made two points:
He does not want the government to be able to tell the BBC it cannot bid for a programme such as The Voice, show Strictly Come Dancing or run the news at 22:00.
Targets, strategy - fine. Permission to fiddle about with the schedules - no.
The BBC's 1981 Royal Charter begins with an acknowledgment of "our right trusty and well beloved counsellor William Stephen Ian Whitelaw" and his decision to offer the corporation a charter that would expire on 31 December 1996.
Home Secretary Willie Whitelaw had decided to give the BBC a 15-year charter.
There would be many arguments and near fatal collisions between the BBC and government over those years, but one essential tool of control - writing the rule book - would be out of the government's hands for 15 years.
And the date of the previous charter? 1964.
Former Prime Minister Harold Wilson never truly forgave the BBC for the 1971 Yesterday's Men documentary, with its mocking musical soundtrack - but the BBC's charter was, over those years, out of bounds.
Some 34 years on from that deal with the "well beloved counsellor", debate seems to have switched to a rather shorter time span.
Lord Hall mentioned some unnamed figures were now thinking of a five-year charter.
And given how long the debate over these things goes on for (remember the next one will not come into force until 2017 and the official parliamentary inquiry into the future of the BBC charter began in 2013), the feeling is there would be an almost constant political question mark hanging over the BBC.
What is more, having concluded its "Future of the BBC" Report in February 2015, that committee (albeit with a different political flavour after the election) is now carrying out another inquiry into the future of the BBC.
The Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport, John Whittingdale, says it is "perfectly reasonable" to question the size and scope of the BBC. And while the licence fee deal appears to have largely been settled, there is much more to resolve about oversight and governance of the corporation.
The question of how the BBC is to be kept in check is far from settled.
