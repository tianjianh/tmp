But after floods wreaked havoc across Northern Ireland, the school has turned their field into County Fermanagh's newest canoe polo venue.
Students took on their teachers in a game of canoe polo played in kayaks on Thursday.
The pupils had the bragging rights after winning that match 4-2.
They celebrated by dunking their teachers and capsizing their boats.
Water levels on the pitch are currently two to three feet deep.
Teacher Colin Lyons said there was "banter" between the staff and the students in the lead up to the game.
"The pupils have benefited from six weeks practise, the staff have some experience and inexperience."
Mr Lyons said that a number of safety precautions were in place for the match.
"There's a good flush of water from Lough Erne through there, which means the water is clean and safe," he said.
Mr Lyons said the only concerns around the match related to the cold.
Flooding has affected how Devenish College students travel to school each day.
"A lot of the pupils are from rural areas so it has been quite difficult to get in," Mr Lyons said.
"Thankfully people have been able to find a way, people in Fermanagh have been quite resourceful in finding ways of getting people back into schools."
