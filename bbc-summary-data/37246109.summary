The dogs were acting aggressively and posed a risk to officers who were called to Harnall Lane East in the early hours, West Midlands Police said.
The force said the specialist officers, who were executing a warrant, were unable to safely get close enough to the dogs.
A 24-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of owning a prohibited dog.

Pit bulls are one of four breeds of dogs banned under the Dangerous Dogs Act, which was pushed through in 1991 to clamp down on dogs used for fighting.
The other banned breeds are the Japanese tosa, dogo Argentino and fila Brasileiro.
The Act has been a controversial piece of legislation, with some calling for it to be repealed.
