Derbyshire NHS trust bosses rated inadequate

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The management of a troubled NHS Trust has been rated as inadequate in a new report.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
In 2015 a tribunal found an employee of Derbyshire Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust had suffered sexual discrimination from the then chairman.
The Care Quality Commission (CQC) has now given the trust an overall "requires improvement" rating but said it lacked "robust leadership".
The trust said it had an action plan in place to improve areas of concern.
The trust provides services for mental health, young and disabled patients across the county.
Earlier this year, former HR director Helen Marks was awarded more than Â£800,000 when a tribunal found she had been forced out of her job after rejecting the sexual advances of then chairman of Alan Baines.

Both Mr Baines and ex-chief executive, Professor Steve Trenchard, who was also implicated in the actions against Mrs Marks, have left the organisation.
A subsequent review found failures in HR procedures and a lack of oversight for directors.
The CQC inspection, held in June, found "the pace of change and ability of the senior leadership to grasp the seriousness of the deficits has not been quick enough".
A warning notice has now been issued which requires the trust to ensure improvements are made in equality and diversity and safeguarding.
Other concerns highlighted were alleged thefts from some patients not being investigated properly and food being kept in a fridge intended for blood supplies.
In the caring category the trust was rated as "good".
A trust statement said it was "focused on improving leadership and processes in place for HR, governance and culture".
