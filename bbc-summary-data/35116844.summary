Dylan Hartley may replace Chris Robshaw as England captain

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Chris Robshaw will not continue as England captain under new head coach Eddie Jones, with Dylan Hartley a leading contender to replace him.

Harlequins flanker Robshaw was captain throughout Stuart Lancaster's reign and in 42 of his 43 England games.
Joe Launchbury of Wasps has been tipped as a future skipper, but it is thought Jones wants a more confrontational character to lead the side.
Hartley was dropped from the World Cup after being banned for a head-butt.
It was the latest in a long list of disciplinary issues for the Northampton hooker, who has been suspended a total of 54 weeks in his career
However, the 29-year-old's total of 66 England caps makes him one of the most experienced players available to Jones heading into the Six Nations, which starts on 6 February.
Hartley, who captained Northampton to the Premiership title in 2014, has been out of action for a number of weeks with concussion.
He will again be absent for Friday's European Cup match with Racing Metro, but director of rugby Jim Mallinder expects him to return to soon.
Although he is unlikely to continue to lead the side, Robshaw remains firmly on the England radar, but as a blind-side flanker rather than on the open side, where he has won the vast majority of his caps.
Meanwhile, Jones met with former head coach Stuart Lancaster on Wednesday and is in the process of finalising his coaching team.
Jones began overhauling his backroom team by getting rid of Mike Catt, Andy Farrell and Graham Rowntree.
Steve Borthwick has been appointed as forwards coach, although the RFU remains in dispute with his club Bristol, while Saracens defence guru Paul Gustard is expected to join the team in the new year.
Jones is also meeting this week with Northampton attack coach Alex King about a possible role, although Jones will be in charge of shaping England's attacking plan himself.
Jones, 55, was named as England's first foreign head coach last month and met Robshaw, who made his international debut in 2009, on Saturday.
The new coach, who led Japan at the World Cup, has previously said Robshaw, 29, was not "outstandingly good in any area" following England's early exit from the recent World Cup.
England won only one of their opening three matches and became the first sole hosts to be eliminated at the group stage of the tournament.
BBC Radio 5 live's Chris Jones:
Hartley's poor disciplinary record is well documented but, at the age of 29 and with 66 international caps, he is hugely experienced.
His ballast and technical ability were badly missed by England during the World Cup.
Although Robshaw may lose the captaincy under Jones, he remains firmly on the radar as a blind-side flanker.
