The British Geological Survey (BGS) said the tremor was felt at Poulton-le-Fylde in the early hours of Friday.
It was a 1.5 magnitude earthquake of intensity level three, recorded at a depth of 2.7km (1.7 miles). No damage or injuries have been reported.
On 1 April, the Blackpool area was hit by 2.2 magnitude tremor which again centred on Poulton-le-Fylde.
According to seismologists, the UK experiences about 20 earthquakes a year of a similar magnitude, the majority of which occur along the west coast.
The largest recorded earthquake experienced in the UK occurred in 1931 and measured 6.1. The epicentre was Dogger Bank in the North Sea.
