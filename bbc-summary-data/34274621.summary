The National Crime Agency (NCA) is looking for Balwinder Rai, 28, who has connections with Birmingham and London.
Border Force officials seized Â£500,000 worth of cannabis from a lorry at the Channel Tunnel terminal in France.
Officers believe its route from Spain to Staines, Surrey, was used to smuggle around a tonne of illegal drugs.
A spokesman for NCA said: "Balwinder Rai has extensive links in the Hayes area of west London, where we know he lived and operated a 'man-with-a-van' type business.
"He also spent some time in the Hollywood area of south Birmingham.
"It is important that we speak to him as soon as possible, so I would urge him to come forward."
