Police said the boys, who are all aged 16 or younger, suffered significant adverse effects from consuming the "potent" pills.
The first was admitted to Borders General Hospital in Melrose suffering from severe sedation on Tuesday.
Over subsequent days, another seven boys have been treated.
Police have issued a drugs warning, urging members of the public to avoid the tablets "at all costs".
Officers believe more pills may still be in circulation in the Borders area and are asking people to be alert to the risks.
Inspector Calum Welsh, of Police Scotland, said: "These recent and unfortunate incidents highlight the significant dangers of taking non-prescribed drugs.
"It is clear that the, as yet unidentified, pink tablets are extremely potent and should be avoided at all costs.
"We believe there are more tablets circulating, particularly in the Hawick area, and my message to the public is to stay vigilant.
"I would urge anyone who has taken the tablet and who feels unwell or knows anyone who appears unwell after taking the substance to please seek medical treatment as soon as possible."
