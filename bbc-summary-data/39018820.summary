[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Tottenham have no new reported injury problems after their midweek Europa League exit.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Left-back Danny Rose (knee) and midfielder Erik Lamela (hip) both remain on the sidelines.
Stoke's Xherdan Shaqiri could return after missing three weeks with a calf injury.
Manager Mark Hughes may give Saido Berahino his first start for the club after a couple of appearances as a substitute.
Guy Mowbray: "After the disappointment of exiting Europe at Wembley, Spurs return to their real home for the first of four games in a row there.
"Unbeaten at White Hart Lane all season, it could now be a comfort blanket to reheat a campaign that's cooled in the last month.
"With 10 points to make up on Chelsea, the realistic target is to seal a Champions League place - something first achieved thanks to Peter Crouch seven years ago.
"Stoke's top scorer will get a warmer welcome back than old Spurs foe Charlie Adam - not that the Scotsman wants one. He got his own warm fuzzy feeling from the birth of his third child this week!"

Tottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino: "We need to move on and forget [the defeat in the Europa League] and try to be focused on Sunday, and ready to fight because the [Premier League] doesn't wait for you.
"It always pushes you to give your best. Now is not the time to cry, but to move on and to start preparing for the game against Stoke."
Stoke manager Mark Hughes: "The key to the game on Sunday is to start brightly and get a foothold in the game. Hopefully we will be sharp from the off.
"They are a strong side, they are very impressive at home and we will be up against it. We are in good shape though.
"We disappointed ourselves against Spurs earlier in the season but we are a different proposition for them now. We have improved."
Spurs were outplayed in their last league game, at Liverpool, because they were not allowed enough of the ball.
Sunday will be a different story. Stoke will dig in, of course, but Tottenham have got players who can hurt them.
