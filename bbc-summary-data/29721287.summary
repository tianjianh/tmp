Watford head coach Slavisa Jokanovic has said his players need to be "smarter" after their 2-2 draw with promotion rivals Nottingham Forest.

The Hornets controlled large parts of the game and led twice, but were pegged back by two Michail Antonio equalisers as Forest claimed a point.
"In the last 30 minutes we lost control and we tried to win the game in the wrong way," the 46-year-old said.
"My team needed to show patience and be smarter."
The Serb has four points from his first two games in charge of the Vicarage Road side, following a 3-0 win at Sheffield Wednesday at the weekend.
Watford looked comfortable in an impressive first hour against Forest, Odion Ighalo's close-range finish and Matej Vydra's penalty coming either side Antonio's first for the visitors. An even last 30 minutes of the game ended with Antonio heading his second goal.
"We had a lot of problems, we tried to win the game with our hearts and not our minds," said the former Partizan Belgrade boss.
"My team wanted to change the situation and wanted to find a way to win the game, but it meant we lost control.
"When I arrived here I tried to explain that I wanted to play offensive football and have control in the match.
"You cannot make one team in 10 days, we are starting a process."
Jokanovic became Watford's fourth head coach this season when he took over from Billy McKinlay two weeks ago.
Despite the draw, Watford remain second in the table, a point behind leaders Derby, after extending their unbeaten run to seven matches.
"We played good attacking football, but made one mistake and Nottingham Forest scored a goal," he added.
"I am going to insist we try and play in this way, sometimes we are going to make mistakes."
