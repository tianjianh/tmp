The former Pakistan international, who turns 41 this month, took nine wickets in the T20 Blast for Surrey last season at an average of 26.22.
He will join up with the county in May and be available for selection in all T20 Blast games.
"To be given the opportunity to coach as well as play is something I'm very excited about," he said.
Mahmood will oversee the likes of Aaron Finch, Kumar Sangakkara and Dwayne Bravo in his coaching role, who are all set to play for Surrey at various stages of the season.
In one of his appearances for Surrey last season, he hit a six off the final ball to seal a four-wicket win against Gloucestershire at The Oval.
"Being able to tap into his wealth of cricket knowledge and experience will be a big asset for the club," director of cricket Alec Stewart said.
