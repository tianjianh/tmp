Jamie Reynolds, 22, from Avondale Road, Wellington, earlier appeared via videolink at Stafford Crown Court charged with her murder.
He was remanded in custody and will reappear in court on 6 September.
Georgia's body was found in woodland off the Nant-y-Garth pass on Friday. She was identified by dental records.

An inquest into the teenager's death has been opened and adjourned to a later date.
Police are still trying to locate Georgia's polka dot satchel, a make-up bag, a white Samsung Galaxy Y phone and items of her clothing.
Det Supt Adrian McGee said: "Although the investigation has progressed quite quickly over the past few days, there is still a lot of work for us to do."
