[SN]TITLE[SN]
Flintshire council votes to suspend right to buy

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A north Wales council has voted in favour of social housing tenants losing the right to buy their homes.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Flintshire council says the change is needed because of a growing shortage of affordable homes in the county.
A consultation will be carried out involving key stakeholders and council tenants.
Swansea and Carmarthenshire councils have already successfully applied to the Welsh government to exercise the option to suspend the right to buy.
