[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Aldershot continued their 100% start to the National League season with a thumping of Guiseley.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The hosts dominated the early exchanges and thought they had taken the lead in the 14th minute as Bobby-Joe Taylor headed in a James Rowe cross, but the goal was ruled out by an offside flag.
Just six minutes later the the home side took a deserved lead thanks to Matt McClure's curled effort which went in off the inside of the far post.
Guiseley then had a goal disallowed, but shortly afterwards Aldershot added to their lead with goals from Callum Reynolds and Jim Kellerman and there was even time for the Shots to make it 4-0 before the break as Shamir Fenelon grabbed his side's fourth.
Rowe added his name to the scoresheet with a low 20-yard drive into the bottom corner, before McClure rounded off the scoring with his second of the afternoon to make it 6-0, Aldershot's biggest league win since December 2013.
