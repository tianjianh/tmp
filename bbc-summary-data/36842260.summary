Ex-UBS trader Kweku Adoboli loses UK deportation appeal

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Kweku Adoboli, former UBS trader convicted of fraud, has lost his appeal against being deported from the UK.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
His unauthorised trading lost the Swiss bank £1.4bn ($2.2bn) and in 2012 he was sentenced to seven years jail on two counts of fraud.
Mr Adoboli was released in 2015, but foreign nationals sentenced to more than four years are automatically considered for deportation.
He is Ghanaian but has lived in the UK since the age of 12.
The decision by the Upper Tribunal of the Immigration and Asylum Chamber pointed out that "while he was socially and culturally integrated into the United Kingdom, his family was in Ghana" and that Mr Adoboli "had not established that there would be very significant obstacles in his reintegration into life in Ghana".
The son of a UN diplomat, who was educated at a Yorkshire boarding school, Mr Adoboli said he would continue fighting the deportation.
A crowdfunding page has been set up to help him raise £75,000 for legal costs. More than £10,000 has been pledged in just two days.
During his trial, Mr Adoboli said that UBS staff had been encouraged to take risks until they got "a slap on the back of the wrist" by senior managers.
The Financial Conduct Authority banned Adoboli from working in the City for life.
UBS was fined £29.7m for systems and control failures related to the unauthorised trading losses.
