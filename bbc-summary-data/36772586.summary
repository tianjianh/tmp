Johnson, 28, was jailed for six years after being found guilty of sexual touching, but not guilty on a charge relating to another sexual act.
The former Sunderland player had previously admitted grooming the girl and one charge of sexual activity.
His sister posted on Twitter that she was devastated.
Johnson's trial at Bradford Crown Court in March heard that he had kissed and sexually touched the schoolgirl in his Range Rover, in a secluded spot in County Durham.
A statement from his solicitor said: "We have received notification that Adam Johnson's applications for leave to appeal against his conviction and sentence have been refused by the Single Judge.
"He is obviously disappointed - having carefully considered all of the information, we will be lodging renewed applications on conviction and sentence in the coming days."
