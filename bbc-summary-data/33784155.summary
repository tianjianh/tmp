The bank will plough more profit into its capital base - the buffer it keeps to absorb surprise losses.
It is now targeting a tier-1 capital ratio of 11% by the end of 2016, having already beaten its current 10% target.
SocGen reported second-quarter net income of €1.35bn ($1.5bn; £943m) and revenue of €6.87bn.
Analysts had estimated net income of €969m and revenue of €6.13bn.
France's second-biggest listed lender said it planned to save another €850m in costs by 2017 on top of its annual target this year of €900m.
Following in the footsteps of other large banks, it set aside €200m against potential litigation.
Its French retail bank's revenue rose 4.2% as the economy improved, while investment banking sales advanced by 16.6%, helped out by a weak euro and stronger demand for share deals as stock markets rally.
SocGen shares jumped 7% in early trading in Paris.
