Orange fined €350m in France for market abuse

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Telecoms firm Orange has been fined €350m (£254m) for abusing its market dominance in France.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The country's anti-trust authority said Orange, which was formerly France Telecom, kept business clients from switching to competitors' phone services.
The firm will not appeal against the decision, and said it would adapt its practices based on the ruling.
An Orange spokesman said the fine would have "no impact" on financial results.
Orange used anti-competitive discounts to discourage business customers from leaving, the Autorite de la Concurrence said.
The firm also used discriminatory practices toward other fixed-line operators that lacked access and inside information about France's copper line network.
The Orange mobile network was bought by France Telecom, the state phone monopoly, in 2000.
France Telecom then changed its name to Orange in 2013.
The UK business of Orange merged with T-Mobile in 2010 to form EE.
