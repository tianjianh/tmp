Celtic deserved more against Malmo, says Ronny Deila

Celtic boss Ronny Deila was frustrated not to establish a stronger lead over Malmo in the Champions League play-off.

A stoppage-time goal from ex-Celtic forward Jo Inge Berget left the tie finely poised at 3-2 to Deila's men.
"You get disappointed that you feel you could get something more," the Norwegian reflected on the first leg.
"They scored on almost the two chances they had. But we have to see out the two legs, and they have to beat us in Malmo to get through."
Celtic took an early lead with goals in the opening 10 minutes from Leigh Griffiths and Nir Bitton.
Berget scored either side of Griffiths's second after the interval, however, to give Malmo two crucial away goals for the return leg in Sweden on Tuesday.
"It could be better but it's an OK result," Deila said. "I think we played well in the first half, especially at the start of the game. We were all over them and scored two great goals.
"So, of course it was a little bit disappointing in the end but I have a very good belief we can do it in Malmo.
"We are ahead one goal and we were ahead when we faced Qarabag [in the third qualifying round] and we defended very well down there, so we can do both things."
Berget's second came from a corner Deila believed his side ought to have dealt with better.
"We haven't almost conceded goals in set-plays this season - that's one of the first," he said. "Two players going in the same challenge and it bounced down.
"It's small details. The second was something we should have cleared out, we had enough people in the box to take out those two players."
The 39-year-old, who is beginning his second season at Celtic, was pleased with the performance of Griffiths, who started ahead of summer signing Nadir Ciftci.
The diminutive striker's second goal earned him particular praise, as he rose highest in the penalty area to loop a header in off the post.
"He played well. They were great goals he scored," Deila said. "The second, he shows he is small but he is good in the air.
"He had played so many games now - Nadir has been out for 14 days, Griffiths has scored goals in every game. He is in good shape now. That was a good choice and he scored good goals."
Defender Mikael Lustig, however, picked up a hamstring injury in the second half and left on a stretcher to be replaced by Efe Ambrose.
"I haven't talked with him yet, but of course it doesn't look well," added Deila.
"We'll have to see how serious it is - he's a good, important player for us, and we'll see tomorrow how bad it is."
