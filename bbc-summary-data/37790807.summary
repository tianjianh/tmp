Aleksandra King was seen in Thursday evening's episode telling her teammates during a planning meeting that she wanted to exit the show immediately.
The business consultancy owner said: "I've found the process overwhelming, stressful and really intense."
It is the first time a business hopeful has walked before a task has begun.
King told her teammates: "I'm going to leave the process, I'm really sorry... I'm going to go."
Digital marketing manager Mukai Noiri was seen telling King: "Aleks, we're just starting a task, it's not exactly the ideal moment."
But King repeated her intention to leave before wishing her teammates luck and leaving the room.
Speaking outside the room, King said: "I just want to go home to my kids and my husband now."
Her teammates expressed surprise at the decision, with Grainne McCoy describing it as "a bit of a shock for the system".
King's decision to exit left 15 candidates remaining to compete for a Â£250,000 investment from Lord Sugar.
Her team continued to work on the task without her, which saw them taking over a section of department store Liberty of London.
Digital marketing manager Mukai Noiri was fired by Lord Sugar at the end of the episode.
