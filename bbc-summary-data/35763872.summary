Manager Neil Lennon believes Bolton may have a "mental fragility" after their winless run stretched to six matches.

The Trotters scored in the 97th minute to secure a 2-2 draw at Ipswich.
Darren Pratley, Mark Davies, Zack Clough, Derik Osede, Liam Feeney, Dean Moxey, Rob Holding and Liam Trotter all missed chances in the first half.
"You can talk about tactics and team selection but when you miss glaring opportunities like we are, it's very hard to take," Lennon said.
"It shouldn't have been a fightback."
With 10 matches remaining, Bolton are 10 points adrift of safety, having lost four of their last six Championship matches.
However, Lennon believes recent results do not reflect the on-field performances from his side.
"We should be winning games," he told BBC Radio Manchester. "I don't know if there is a mental fragility at times, we just seemed to get punished.
"I can't fault the players, the performance again was excellent, but we have had so many chances to win games over the last four or five weeks but haven't taken our chances.
"We don't look like a team at the bottom of the league but the table doesn't lie. We keep getting punished for basic mistakes.
"They didn't look like scoring. They get a set-piece and didn't defend it properly - and we find ourselves remarkably 2-0 down in a game we have dominated."
