The Lancashire seamer hopes to be fit for the tri-series against Australia and India in January and the ICC Cricket World Cup in February.
The 32-year-old will travel to South Africa in December for rehabilitation with the England Performance Programme.
At present he will not be replaced in the squad for the Sri Lanka tour.
The England and Wales Cricket Board said in a statement: "James Anderson has been ruled out of the upcoming one day tour to Sri Lanka to continue his rehabilitation on a pre-existing left knee injury.
"Anderson experienced some knee discomfort during the summer and in preparation for the ICC Cricket World Cup will undergo a graded return to bowling programme over the next two months."
Fellow paceman Stuart Broad, 28, also misses the one-day series in Sri Lanka but hopes to be fit for January's one-day tri-series in Australia.
Broad had surgery in September on a patella tendon of his right knee.
England will take part in seven ODIs in Sri Lanka, beginning in Colombo on 26 November.
England ODI squad to tour Sri Lanka: Alastair Cook (Essex, captain), Moeen Ali (Worcestershire), Ian Bell (Warwickshire), Ravi Bopara (Essex), Jos Buttler (Lancashire), Steven Finn (Middlesex), Harry Gurney (Nottinghamshire), Alex Hales (Nottinghamshire), Chris Jordan (Sussex), Eoin Morgan (Middlesex), Joe Root (Yorkshire), Ben Stokes (Durham), James Taylor (Nottinghamshire), James Tredwell (Kent), Chris Woakes (Warwickshire).
