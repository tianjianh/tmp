[SN]TITLE[SN]
Northampton Town 0-1 Bolton Wanderers

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Zach Clough grabbed the only goal of the game as in-form Bolton beat Northampton at Sixfields.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Trotters moved into the automatic promotion places in League One after claiming an eighth win in nine matches, with this result their third victory in a row.
However, it was the Cobblers who started the brightest as David Buchanan's shot on the turn tested Ben Alnwick and Matt Taylor rattled the upright after good work from Kenji Gorre.
In between, Bolton's Sammy Ameobi volleyed straight at David Cornell.
Ameobi also had a close range effort blocked and Jay Spearing fired over before the Cobblers went close again through Sam Hoskins.
But Bolton broke the deadlock in the 25th minute when neat play on the left ended with Ameobi putting in Clough and he beat the advancing Cornell from 10 yards.
The impressive Clough was just off target with an overhead kick moments later as Bolton continued to look a threat going forward.
Northampton upped their tempo after the restart and began to ask questions of the Bolton defence, with substitute Marc Richards having an effort ruled out for offside.
But the visitors went close when Tom Thorpe tested Cornell from distance.
The hardworking Hoskins was denied by Alnwick as Northampton sensed a deserved equaliser.
They forced the issue in the latter stages, with Richards having another close range effort scrambled clear while Taylor was twice denied by Alnwick, who also thwarted substitute John-Joe O'Toole.
