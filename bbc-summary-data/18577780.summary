[SN]TITLE[SN]
It's official: Dull road sign marks Boring link

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Perthshire hamlet of Dull has marked its decision to pair with the US town of Boring by unveiling a road sign.

The sign welcomes visitors to "Dull - paired with Boring, Oregon, USA" and says "Drive Safely".
The move came about after a friend of a local resident cycled through Boring and suggested the link.
The difference in size between Boring and Dull meant they could not officially become twin towns.
Boring has a population of 12,000 while Dull is a tiny village.
The potential link between the two locations was the brainchild of Perthshire resident Elizabeth Leighton, who passed through Boring while on a cycling holiday.
Boring was named after William H Boring, an early resident of the area and former Union soldier in the American Civil War.
Dull's name is thought to have come from the Gaelic word for meadow, but others have speculated it could be connected to the Gaelic word "dul" meaning snare.
