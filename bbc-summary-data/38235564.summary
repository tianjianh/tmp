Edwards recently took a position as a non-executive board director with Hampshire and Southern Vipers, who she captained to the inaugural Women's Super League title in the summer.
The 36-year-old retired from international cricket in May, having captained England more than 200 times.
She will play for Adelaide Strikers in the Women's Big Bash this winter.
"After spending the last year at the Ageas Bowl with the Southern Vipers it felt the right move for me to play my last few years of cricket with the club," Edwards told the Hampshire website.
"The opportunity has come at a great time in my career and I look forward to playing with such a young and exciting group over the next few seasons."
Hampshire play in Division Two of the 50-over Women's County Championship and T20 competitions.
"The immense value, experience and knowledge she adds will be key in driving the improvement of women's and girls' cricket in Hampshire and across the Southern Vipers region," said Bob Parks, Hampshire Women head of performance.
