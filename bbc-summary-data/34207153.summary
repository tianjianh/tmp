A training academy could be set up by Flintshire council to train apprentices to work on three multimillion pound building projects in the county.

A total of £500m is being spent on new homes, education facilities and upgrades to public housing over the next five years.
The authority said the work could create 250 jobs and 40 apprenticeships.
Firms bidding for the work would need to take new recruits from the council's academy if plans are agreed.
As part of the tendering process, the council said contractors would be required to confirm the number of local jobs, training opportunities and traineeships available.
And it then wants its proposed academy to manage those employment opportunities.
Council leader Aaron Shotton said: "We want to make sure that we maximise job and training opportunities and develop a lasting legacy for the county and the authority."
Flintshire council's cabinet is being recommended to approve plans at its meeting on 15 September.
