Isabel Gentry, 16, was in the middle of her AS revision last Wednesday when she started feeling unwell and was taken to Bristol Royal Infirmary by ambulance.
Hours later, the St Brendan's Sixth Form College student was allowed home.
The NHS Foundation Trust, said it believes the assessment and treatment were "appropriate" as initial symptoms were "not typical of meningitis".
University Hospitals Bristol NHS Foundation Trust, which runs Bristol Royal Infirmary, said the teenager, known as Izzy, was discharged after initial treatment and a five-hour observation in the accident and emergency department.
The trust said Izzy "appeared to improve" and was advised she should seek further medical attention if her symptoms returned.
She was readmitted later that day and her symptoms were recognised by doctors as being "typical" of meningitis. She died two days later.
Deborah Lee, chief operating officer for the trust, said an initial investigation into Izzy's death had not revealed any shortcomings in the "assessment, care or treatment given at the time of her presentation".
She continued: "Izzy's symptoms were not typical of meningitis at the time of first presentation and we believe that both the assessment and treatment were appropriate.
"Sadly, we cannot bring Izzy back but will do our very best to see if there is any learning for ourselves or others that could prevent such a tragedy happening again."
Friends have posted tributes on social media to the teenager.
Ben Flinton wrote: "Absolutely devastated to hear of the sudden passing of Izzy Gentry. One of the nicest, funniest girls I'll ever meet."
Chloe Hughes said her friend was "taken way too soon", adding: "God really does take the best ones, rest in peace you gorgeous girl."
Eryn O'Connell wrote: "You were without a doubt one of the most bubbly souls going with an amazing energy. You brought so much life to us all and it will never be the same without you."
Avon Coroner's Court confirmed that an inquest into the teenager's death is likely to be opened and adjourned next week.
