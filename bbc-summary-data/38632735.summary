[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Kilkenny showed Antrim no mercy as they hammered the Saffrons 6-27 to 0-19 in Sunday's Walsh Cup game at Abbotstown.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The scoreline could have been ever worse for Antrim as their keeper Chris O'Connell made several brilliant saves.
Goals from Jonjo Farrell and Ollie Walsh helped the Cats lead 2-2 to 0-1 although Antrim stayed in touch to trail only 2-12 to 0-10 at half-time.
The second half was one-way traffic as Richie Hogan, Richie Leahy (two) and Farrell added further three pointers.
In addition to keeper O'Connell, Conor McCann and Conor McKinley battled well for the Antrim but the gulf in class showed the tough job that joint-managers Terence McNaughton and Dominic McKinley have on their hands in re-establishing the Saffrons as a genuine hurling force.
