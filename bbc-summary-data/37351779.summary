England head coach Eddie Jones says his staff will learn from their Team GB counterparts as they try to usurp New Zealand as the game's dominant force.

Jones' side have won a Grand Slam and completed a 3-0 series whitewash of Australia since he took charge in 2015.
The Australian's staff are to meet with GB's Olympic hockey, judo and cycling coaches as they look for improvements.
"We need to coach better so our staff have been working very hard investigating other sports," he said.
"With Great Britain doing so well at the Olympics, there are a number of sports to look at and learn from."
Team GB won 67 medals at Rio 2016 to finish second in the table ahead of China.
The women's hockey team, coached by Danny Kerry, won gold for the first time by beating defending champions the Netherlands in a dramatic penalty shootout.
Jones said: "If you look on face value at the talent in that team compared to the Holland team, it's probably not as great so his ability to create such a dynamic and hard-working team is fascinating."

Jones says he would be happy for his staff to join next summer's British and Irish Lions tour to New Zealand, should they be chosen by Warren Gatland.
Wales boss Gatland will name his backroom staff on 7 December, with England forwards coach Steve Borthwick and defence coach Paul Gustard both contenders.
"It's a great opportunity for them to learn from Warren, who is one of the most experienced coaches in the world," said Jones.
