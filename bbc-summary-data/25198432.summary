The area around Green Park, which also has a large business park, is notorious for its long traffic queues, particularly on match days.
Plans for Green Park Station were put on hold two years ago, but the council now wants work on it to start within three years.
Reading Borough Council is set to re-submit planning proposals for the stop next year.
The stop, by junction 11 of the M4 on the Reading to Basingstoke line, is expected to cost up to ??8m to build.
The plans were pulled two years ago when a key developer dropped out.
Simon Beasley, network manager at the council, said: "I think it will make a real difference, a positive difference.
"Clearly we don't know how it will be serviced by trains but if there's anybody who can divert from the roads to the railways, then of course that's going to be positive."
