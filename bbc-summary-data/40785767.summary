[SN]TITLE[SN]
Bristol Rovers 4-1 Cambridge United

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Billy Bodin fired Bristol Rovers into the second round of the EFL Cup with a brace of goals as the Pirates saw off Cambridge United at the Memorial Stadium.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Bodin's first in the 13th minute was set up by a superb 40-yard pass by Lee Brown, which left the visitors' defence stranded. The winger controlled the ball on the right-hand edge of the penalty area and advanced to find the corner of the net with a low shot.
The 25-year-old's second goal just before the break made it 2-0 and it was no more than Rovers deserved. The busy Stuart Sinclair passed to Bodin, who once again cut in from the right and his cultured left foot did the rest.
After a nervy start to the second half, Rovers went further in front as Ellis Harrison headed home number three from another Brown cross after 61 minutes.
Cambridge pulled one back five minutes later when Uche Ikpeazu stabbed home from close range, but soon after a spectacular 20-yard strike from summer signing Liam Sercombe made it 4-1 to the delight of the home fans.
