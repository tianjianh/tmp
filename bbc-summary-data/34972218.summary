An M1 northbound lane was closed between junction 11 and 12 after a lorry hit the central reservation at about 06:40 GMT on Monday.
One lane remained closed while recovery work was carried out, with delays back to junction 9.
Bedfordshire Police said 43 people are due to receive letters of prosecution.
"These irresponsible people can expect a notice of intended prosecution to land on their doorstep imminently," said PC Mark West of the Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Hertfordshire Roads Policing Unit.
