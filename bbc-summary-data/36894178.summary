Pressley, 42, replaced former Scotland team-mate Graham Alexander in October 2015 with the club in the relegation zone and guided them to safety.
"The decision was made this morning following a meeting," said a statement on the club website.
"It was agreed it would be best to take the club in a different direction."
Assistant manager Neil McFarlane has also left Fleetwood on an announcement that came just 11 days before the start of the new season on Saturday 6 August, when Fleetwood travel to promoted Northampton Town.
Former centre-back Pressley, who was previously in charge of Coventry and Falkirk, had signed 10 players this summer ahead of the new campaign.
"Fleetwood would like to thank Steven for his professionalism and effort during his nine months at Highbury, particularly in successfully maintaining the club's League One status last season," the statement added.
"Our focus will now turn to the prompt recruitment of a new manager to take the club forward."
The Lancashire side failed to win any of their four pre-season friendlies and first team coach Barry Nicholson and academy director Stuart Murdoch will take charge of Tuesday's game against National League side Southport.
Having been beaten 5-0 at home by Liverpool, they went on a tour of the Netherlands where they drew 0-0 with Fortuna Sittard, lost 5-0 to AZ Alkmaar and were beaten 1-0 by Roda JC.
Former Fleetwood midfielder Keith Southern told BBC Radio Lancashire:
"Only he will know the reasons why he has decided to walk away, but it is frustrating from a fan's point of view because we're on the verge of a new season.
"It didn't think it worked out probably as he, or as chairman Andy Pilley, would have hoped.
"There will be reasons behind it but I think Steven Pressley will say he wasn't given the opportunity to bring in the players I'm sure.
"The way Fleetwood is structured at board level, Gretar Steinsson and Steve Curwood have a massive say on who comes into the club."
