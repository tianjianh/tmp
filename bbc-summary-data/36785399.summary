Jamie Spendiff's attack on Craig Logie, who was out with friends on a stag night, was captured on CCTV.
Spendiff took part in a further assault on other men with co-accused Shaun McCarthy after killing the married 36-year-old last August.
McCarthy was sentenced to 250 hours of unpaid work and a weekend curfew.
In CCTV footage, Mr Logie can be seen lying motionless on the ground after the assault.
Advocate depute Andrew Brown QC told the court: "Witnesses speak to hearing the sound of a crack as the deceased's head hit the ground and he did not move thereafter."
The construction manager suffered a brain injury and fracture to the back of his head following the attack at Friars Street on 7 August.
Spendiff, of Cullercoats, North Tyneside, admitted assaulting and killing Mr Logie by punching him on the head causing him to fall to the ground where he struck his head.
He also pled guilty to committing a breach of the peace along with Shaun McCarthy by conducting themselves in a disorderly manner and fighting with others.
Both also pled guilty to assaulting Paul Stubberfield and Stuart McKee in a taxi in Friars Street.
The court heard that Spendiff and McCarthy had gone out drinking for the evening after working together as technicians on wind turbines.
Mr Brown said that everyone appeared to be in good spirits, but a member of the stag party and another drinker then became involved in a heated argument.
After patrons left the pub, a general melee broke out which ended with the fatal blow to Mr Logie.
Mr Brown said: "With the deceased now on the ground Spendiff initially moved away before returning and danced round the deceased, at all times being moved away by the accused McCarthy and at one stage a female passer-by."
At the High Court in Glasgow, judge Lady Stacey told Spendiff: "After you had punched Mr Logie and must have known that he had hit his head and was flat out on the ground, you went up to a taxi and punched other people.
"I accept you did not intend to cause his death, but that is in fact what happened.
"I understand you are remorseful and you are accepting responsibility for the terrible harm caused by your actions."
