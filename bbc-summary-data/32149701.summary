Edwina Hart said there was "no place" for such terms of employment, while election campaigning in the Vale of Glamorgan.
Earlier on Wednesday, party leader Ed Miliband said a Labour government at Westminster would give workers the right to a regular contract after 12 weeks of regular hours.
The Conservatives have claimed the move would be a threat to jobs.
Mrs Hart said she has never liked the contracts.
