Johnsen, who has dual US and Norwegian citizenship, has signed a three-year contract, subject to international clearance.
He told Hearts' website: "I felt really wanted by them.
"This league is looking like it's going to be tough this year and I want to be pushing at the top of the table."
Johnsen becomes the fifth forward to be signed by the Scottish Premiership club this summer.
Conor Sammon, previously of Derby County, started in Thursday's Europa League defeat by Birkirkara at Tynecastle, while former Dundee United striker Robbie Muirhead was on the bench.
Hearts have also recruited Nikolay Todorov, previously of Nottingham Forest, while Tony Watt this week arrived on loan from Charlton Athletic.
Johnsen, who has over 50 career goals, began his senior career with Tonsberg in Norway before moving to Spain with Antequera and Atletico Baleares.
Spells in Portugal with Louletano and Atletico Club de Portugal followed before Johnsen joined Litex in 2015.
Asked what type of player Hearts fans would see, the striker said: "I'm a fast player and I'm good with my feet and in the air.
"I want to help out, providing assists and not just goals is key."
