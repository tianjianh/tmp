Rodgers men will finish bottom of Group C and play their last game in the section away to Manchester City on Tuesday.
"We know that'll be a real huge test," said Rodgers, whose side beat Motherwell 4-3 on Saturday.
"We want to go out with a real good performance. We go into every game to win."
The Scottish champions have picked up two points so far in their five group games, having drawn 3-3 with City in Glasgow and 1-1 away with Borussia Monchengladbach. The Germans also beat Celtic, as did Barcelona twice.
"Every challenge and every game for us has been different," explained Rodgers. "It's our last game in the Champions League so we want to go out on a high.
Celtic trailed 2-0 at half-time against Well and were behind again at 3-2 after briefly drawing level.
But the visitors at Fir Park quickly levelled things up again and Tom Rogic's late strike sealed a dramatic win for the Premiership leaders, who maintained their eight-point advantage and remain unbeaten domestically this season.
"To score the four goals, to win the game, it really shows the mentality of the team," added Rodgers on BBC Radio Scotland.
"I'm delighted for them because it shows you that if you can play with that aggression and you can be as offensive and aggressive in your attack, you can get the results.
"I'm not really worried and forecasting how long the run can go on. I just look to the next game."

Match-winner Rogic also praised Celtic's resolve at Fir Park.
"We showed how close we are as a team and we fought to the end and it was a nice reward," he said. "We're champions for a reason."
Of Tuesday's match at the Etihad Stadium, the Australia midfielder added: "We have a lot of fans all around the world. They deserve to see us playing at that level. I guess the campaign hasn't gone the way we'd like but it's nice to be back in it.
"I'm sure we're going to learn from this and the goal is to be back next year in the competition and develop and progress further than we have this season.
"Our group has been very difficult. After not being in the competition for a couple of years, it's something that we're definitely learning from.
"We have to make sure we're back there next season playing at that level because that's where the club deserves to be."
