Macedonia braced for huge anti-government protest

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Thousands of protesters are due to take part in a rally in the Macedonian capital Skopje to demand the resignation of long-serving Prime Minister Nikola Gruevski.

The rally follows months of allegations that he has abused his power.
Covert recordings released by the opposition appear to show ministers plotting vote-rigging and the covering-up of a murder.
Last week two ministers and the head of the intelligence service resigned.
Opposition leaders said intelligence chief Saso Mijalkov and Interior Minister Gordana Jankulovska were behind attempts to control the press, judiciary and electoral officials by tapping their phones.
However, the government denies the allegations and insists the opposition is trying to destabilise the country for its own benefit. It is organising a counter-demonstration on Monday.
The political instability comes as the country wrestles with the aftermath of clashes last weekend between ethnic Albanians and police.
Fourteen ethnic Albanians and eight police officers were killed in fighting that followed a police raid on an ethnic Albanian neighbourhood in the northern town of Kumanovo.
Ethnic Albanians make up one quarter of Macedonia's 2.1 million  population.
The Oval Office tapes finished off US President Richard Nixon. Now the Macedonian equivalent is threatening to do the same to Nikola Gruevski. Covert recordings apparently show ministers plotting everything from vote-rigging and media manipulation to covering up a murder by a police officer.
The opposition leader Zoran Zaev says the prime minister has to go. The rally may show how many Macedonians agree. But the protest movement had been running separately from the political parties, and some have said they are not happy about Mr Zaev's involvement.
The demonstration will also be a challenge to the professionalism of the authorities. Western diplomats have urged the police to show restraint - and the government to launch a credible investigation into all the allegations.
Power struggle in Macedonia
Opposition leader Zoran Zaev has been releasing a steady stream of recordings since February.
His party accuses the government of wiretapping 20,000 people, including politicians, journalists and religious leaders.
He says that scores of leaked recordings reveal corruption at the highest levels of government, including the mismanagement of funds, dubious criminal prosecutions of opponents and even cover-ups of killings.
He argues that the abuse of power allegations are so serious that the prime minister has to resign and call new elections.
Opposition parties have boycotted parliament since accusing the governing coalition of fraud in the April 2014 election.
But Mr Gruevski, who has won successive elections since 2006, has repeatedly rejected the allegations.
He has accused Mr Zaev of orchestrating a coup at the behest of unnamed foreign spy agencies who want to overthrow his conservative government.
