The Lewes event aims to celebrate and showcase the latest in public and artistic lighting design.
Organisers hope to develop an annual Festival of Light which would also promote the town's history, architecture and creativity.
Professional lighting designers have transformed around 10 key landmarks, including Pells Pool and Lewes Castle.
The two-day event aims to explore science, astronomy, sustainability, health, environment, wildlife and the impact of lighting in a sensitive area.
