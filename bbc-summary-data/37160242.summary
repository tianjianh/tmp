Britain is the first country to improve on a home medal tally at the following Games, collecting 67 to beat the 65 from London 2012.
Some team members have returned home already, but 320 athletes and support staff will be on British Airways flight BA2016 scheduled to land at Heathrow.
The Boeing 747 will have a gold nose cone and a "victoRIOus" livery.
There will also be pole vaults, javelins and a 6.7-metre sail in the hold, while 77 bottles of champagne and a three-course menu will be on offer.
Among the athletes to have already arrived in the UK are golf's gold medal winner Justin Rose, Jessica Ennis-Hill and Mark Cavendish, who claimed heptathlon and omnium cycling silver respectively, the men's rugby sevens silver medallists, and long jump bronze winner Greg Rutherford.
"London 2012 will always be the greatest modern Olympics but the medal haul we have come away with is out of this world," Rutherford told the One Show.
A total of 67 medals, with 27 golds, put Team GB second in the medal table - above China for the first time since the latter returned to the Games in 1984.
They won gold medals across more sports than any other nation - 15 - and improved on their medal haul for the fifth consecutive Olympics.
Of the 366 athletes who went to the Rio Games for Team GB, 130 of them - just over 35% - returned with a medal, including every member of the 15-strong track cycling team.
Manchester and London will host events to recognise the success of Britain's Olympic and Paralympic stars.
