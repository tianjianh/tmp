Police said the child was struck on Kingswood Road on Friday afternoon by a light-coloured Audi hatchback, thought to be an Audi A3.
Det Sgt Steve Pidgeon said it was "impossible to believe the driver did not know they had been involved in a very serious collision".
He urged the driver to contact the Met Police.
Scotland Yard said the car was "likely to have sustained damage to the headlights" and appealed for witnesses to contact them.
