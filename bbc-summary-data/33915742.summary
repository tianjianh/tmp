Lancashire 'Boil water' alert into second week

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
More than 300,000 homes in Lancashire are to enter a second week of boiling drinking water following the latest test results, said United Utilities.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A company spokesman said the ban remained, although the latest results showed reduced traces of the microbial parasite cryptosporidium in the water.
Restrictions will stay until there are no traces of the parasite in the water.
The decision was made in a meeting with Public Health England and the Drinking Water Inspectorate.
A United Utilities spokesman said the company was testing the water every day.
On Wednesday it confirmed customers would receive compensation for the incident but did not specify the amount.
Traces of cryptosporidium were found at the Franklaw water treatment works near Preston on 6 August.
The areas affected include Blackpool, Chorley, Fylde, Preston, South Ribble, Wyre and the Mellor area of Blackburn.
