The 20-year-old striker has yet to make a first-team start for the Hatters, but did come off the bench four times towards the end of last season.
"Zane is a hard-working player and caught my eye in training as soon as I arrived," said Luton boss Nathan Jones.
"I have always said that young players have to earn their place in my squad and Zane did exactly that last season."
