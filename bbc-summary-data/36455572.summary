Charlie Heywood, from Great Barr, was walking along Birmingham Road near Barhill Close at about 03:35 BST when he was knocked down.
In tribute, his family described him as an "endlessly kind young man and a much loved son, brother and grandson".
A 19-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of driving while under the influence of drugs, West Midlands Police said.
Passers-by stopped to help Mr Heywood but, despite their efforts and the intervention of paramedics, he was pronounced dead at the scene.
The University College London history undergraduate was the eldest of four brothers.
