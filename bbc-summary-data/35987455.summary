[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A waterpark event which prompted fears of a data mining 'scam' has been removed from Facebook for 'violating standards'.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Thousands expressed their interest in the Summer Safari Waterpark 2016 events advertised for 30 UK cities.
Councils where the events had been advertised said they had not received any applications to host the activity.
Facebook confirmed the pages had been removed for violating community standards.
Councillor Pat Karney from Manchester City Council had said the page "could be a scam".
Tony Neate, chief executive officer at Get Safe Online, said: "Hopefully Facebook has taken some measures into preventing these fake event scams.
"It's a group effort with these things, so the media, law enforcements, the government, Get Safe Online and companies like Facebook all need to work together with the public to put the right advice and processes in place to stop these scams from flourishing."
Water rides and slides, rapids, flumes, mini-beaches, bumper boats "and more" were promised on the site, with each page stating: "We will be secluding off an area to host our outdoor Water Park in your city, so lets Get Wet n Crazy!! This Summer 2016!!"
The Summer Safari Waterpark UK page did not ask for financial information from attendees and said "Please note dates are provisional, more info tba soon".
Event organisers did not provide contact details on the pages, with no phone number, company name or address to identify the people behind the activity.
Similar concerns were raised about a promotion for a non-existent tour based on the BBC's popular Total Wipeout series that were proved to be fake. Facebook also disabled that page.
