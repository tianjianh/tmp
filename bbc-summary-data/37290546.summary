US Open: Caroline Wozniacki through to face Angelique Kerber in semi-final

Caroline Wozniacki made it through to a fifth US Open semi-final after Latvia's Anastasija Sevastova was hampered by an ankle injury in their quarter-final.

Sevastova needed heavy strapping on her right ankle after falling awkwardly in the second game, and Wozniacki raced to a 6-0 6-2 win.
The Dane, 26, is unseeded in New York after slipping to 74th in the world, having been seeded fourth last year.
She will play German second seed Angelique Kerber in the semi-final.
Kerber, 29, defeated Italy's Roberta Vinci, the 2015 finalist, 7-5 6-0.
In the men's draw, France's Gael Monfils outplayed compatriot Lucas Pouille in a 6-4 6-3 6-3 win.
Monfils, seeded 10th, will play fellow Frenchman Jo-Wilfried Tsonga or top seed Novak Djokovic in the last four.
The decisive moment of the second women's quarter-final came as early as the second point of game two, when Sevastova moved to her right and tumbled over while trying to make a service return.
She had threatened to break serve in the opening game but once the ankle was strapped up by the trainer after game three, Sevastova was unable to pose any challenge to Wozniacki.
The two-time finalist simply had to keep the ball in play and her opponent on the move, with the first set wrapped up after 31 minutes and an early break following in the second.
By the time the trainer returned at 6-0 3-0, Sevastova had won just 15 points, and it took 52 minutes for her to finally get on the scoreboard - prompting a relieved smile.
Wozniacki finished the job on serve after little more than an hour, and said: "This year I was out for three months with a sprained ankle - I feel real sorry for her, it happened early in the match.
"I always believe in myself, no matter what my ranking. I've beaten pretty much everyone in the draw before."
Sevastova said: "It was tough, but what can I do? I tried my best. I don't like to retire, but Caroline played great tennis. Even if I had no injury it would be tough to beat her."
Kerber remains in with a chance of overtaking Serena Williams as world number one at the end of the tournament, and she is also on course for a third Grand Slam final in 2016.
Williams, who plays Simona Halep later on Tuesday, must reach the final again in New York to have a chance of staying world number one and if she plays Kerber, the American would have to win.
"When I was a kid I was always dreaming to being the number one," said Kerber.
"Let's see. I mean, there are still matches to go. Also, Serena has to play as well very good."
Vinci caused one of the greatest upsets in tennis history when she ended Williams' calendar Grand Slam hopes in last year's semi-final, but a foot fault on set point all but ended her challenge against Kerber.
The Italian, 33, broke Kerber's serve three times in the first set but each time was broken back - and Vinci was then called for a foot fault facing set point with a second serve.
She sarcastically applauded the line judge, before Kerber raced through the second set in 24 minutes.
