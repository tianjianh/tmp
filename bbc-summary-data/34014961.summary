A man has been jailed for four-and-a-half years after admitting killing a man who died after being found in a Lancashire street with head injuries.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Wayne Bradbury, 30 and of no fixed address, denied murder but admitted manslaughter at Preston Crown Court last month.
Andrew Hayes, 37, was found on Lyndhurst Road, Burnley, on 29 April.
He was taken to the Royal Preston Hospital and died the next morning, Lancashire Police said.
Bradbury was also ordered to pay Â£900 costs and a Â£120 victim surcharge.
Det Insp Andy Cribbin said Bradbury had shown "no remorse" over a "completely unprovoked and cowardly assault".
