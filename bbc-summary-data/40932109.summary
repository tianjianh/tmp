[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Josh Murphy scored twice as Norwich City came from behind to beat Charlton in the second round of the EFL Cup.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Lee Novak opened the scoring for the League One visitors with a rasping shot into the top-left corner from Tarique Fosu's pass.
But Murphy's first-time effort from outside the area and a fine solo goal turned it around for the Canaries.
Marley Watkins' tap-in and Tom Trybull's late volley completed the victory for the Championship side.
Murphy, the twin brother of Jacob, who moved to Newcastle United this summer, was the standout performer and could have had a hat-trick had Dillon Phillips not denied the forward with a fine stop.
Charlton's best opportunity to get back in the game came when they were 2-1 down, but Josh Magennis headed wide.
