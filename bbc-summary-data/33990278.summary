A migraine sufferer died after accidentally taking too many tablets to treat her pain, an inquest has ruled.

Megan Biddle, 18, from Thame in Oxfordshire, died on 2 March at the John Radcliffe Hospital.
She had suffered migraines for several years and had previously been prescribed a drug called propanolol, but stopped taking it last year.
An inquest at Oxford Coroner's Court concluded she had accidentally taken more of the drug than she should have.
Assistant Coroner Nicholas Graham said: "She did take an overdose, medical evidence proves that. We don't know why, but we know that some of the side effects include confusion and memory loss."
In a statement given after the inquest her parents, Iain and Alison Biddle, said they tried many different treatments to cure their daughter of her migraines.
This led to her being prescribed propanolol by a hospital consultant in 2010, which she stopped taking last year.
Mr and Mrs Biddle said they think, in March, she suffered a migraine and took two tablets - the previously prescribed dose - but then became confused and took more of the drug.
"We categorically believe that Megan wouldn't purposely take an overdose," they said.
"Megan was a unique and individual girl. She never felt the need to follow the crowd; she was confident and happy with who she was."
They added that Megan, who was studying for her A-levels at Lord Williams's School, had a passion for music and volunteered at a range of charities.
Mr and Mrs Biddle said: "Although none of this will ever bring her back, it is some comfort to be able to grasp more of an understanding of what we believe happened that day."
