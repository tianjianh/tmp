Lego fan designs Glasgow skyline

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A Lego fan from Glasgow has recreated the city's skyline in a bid to get his designs immortalised in plastic.

Engineer Peter Johnston has submitted the idea to the Lego Ideas website, which invites suggestions for new sets.
The skyline includes tenement flats, Finnieston Crane, Glasgow University, the Squinty Bridge and the Duke of Wellington Statue, famed for its cone.
To be successful, the project needs to reach 10,000 backers and then be approved for production.
So far it has only 160 supporters, but has a year to hit its total.
Mr Johnston's design also features the Glasgow Science Centre Tower, which he says is true to life because it "also doesn't rotate".
He told BBC Scotland he was optimistic that if his models get the support that the Glasgow skyline kits could make the grade.
Mr Johnston's enthusiasm for Lego has even seen him build a copy of his wedding venue, Cloghan Castle in Ireland, including favours for the guests on the big day.
