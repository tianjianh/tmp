[SN]TITLE[SN]
West Brom sign Stephane Sessegnon and Victor Anichebe

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
West Brom have signed Sunderland's Stephane Sessegnon for a club-record fee and Everton striker Victor Anichebe for a fee which could rise to £6m.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Benin forward Sessegnon, 29, was surplus to requirements after Sunderland signed Fabio Borini on loan.
He joined Sunderland from Paris St-Germain in 2011 and West Brom say his fee surpasses the reported £6.5m they paid for Shane Long.
Anichebe, 25, has spent his career so far at Everton.
The Nigeria international has scored 26 goals in 168 appearances for the Toffees.
