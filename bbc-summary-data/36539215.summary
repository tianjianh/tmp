The 30-year-old joined the Millers from Charlton in June 2014 and helped the club retain their Championship status last season.
"I'm very happy. After the last couple of seasons I wanted to get my future sorted out in the Championship," Wood, who also had loan spells with Fleetwood and Chesterfield last season, said.
"It was straightforward and I agreed it before I went away on holiday."
