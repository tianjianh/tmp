By the end of the morning, the benchmark FTSE 100 index was down 15.98 points or 0.28% to 5,673.38.
The fall saw the index extending its decline after tumbling 2.7% on Monday.
The previous day's decline came as analysts said investors were turning against financial shares because of shaky global growth.
Antofagasta was the FTSE 100's worst performer on Tuesday, tumbling 9.4%, while Anglo American was down 9.3%.
On the commodities markets, Brent crude was up 1% to $33.22, while US light crude added 1.6% to $30.16.
On the currency markets, the pound was down 0.03% against the dollar at $1.4428 and 0.29% lower against the euro at â‚¬1.2854.
