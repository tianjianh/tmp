Officers said he was approached by two men as he was out jogging near the married quarters at RAF Marham in Norfolk on Wednesday.
He was threatened with a knife and both men tried to drag him into a car but the serviceman managed to fight them off, said Norfolk Police.
The victim was unhurt, and the two men drove away in a dark vehicle.
Norfolk Police are working with the RAF and have been carrying out searches for the knife and the car.
