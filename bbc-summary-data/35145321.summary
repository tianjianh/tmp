Stars were on course for a win with the ex-England batsman hitting five fours and six sixes as his side chased 178.
But Pietersen was dismissed by Clint McKay as Stars lost by one run.
Pietersen helped Dolphins to the final of the South Africa Ram Slam T20 event earlier this month but they ended up losing the game to Titans.
