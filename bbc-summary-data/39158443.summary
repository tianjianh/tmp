Rangers: Emerson Hyndman praises interim boss Graeme Murty

Emerson Hyndman believes interim Rangers boss Graeme Murty deserves huge credit for the job he has done.

Under-20s coach Murty has been in charge for three Premiership matches following Mark Warburton's departure.
And his side responded to defeats at Dundee and Inverness CT by beating St Johnstone 3-2 at Ibrox for his first Premiership win in charge.
"He's been brilliant," said midfielder Hyndman, who scored the late winner again Saints on Wednesday night.
"It's always a tough position as a kind of interim manager, especially with the way things have gone," on-loan Bournemouth midfielder Hyndman added.
"But I credit him for coming in and establishing what he wants us to do. I think the boys got behind him quite well.
"The results didn't really show what he was doing and how good he was but it was nice to give him that positive feeling on Wednesday night."
Rangers are expected to appoint a new head coach next week, after Saturday's Scottish Cup quarter-final at home to Hamilton Academical.
And with the Premiership gap between third-placed Rangers and second-placed Aberdeen now cut to six points, USA international Hyndman says there is still plenty to play for this term.
"Of course there is," he said. "We saw the Aberdeen result the other night (1-0 defeat at Hamilton) but we're just focused on ourselves at the same time.
"We need to get ourselves right and I think we took our first step against Saints. It was about the three points, it wasn't about how we got it.
"After recent results we've had it was very important we got three points on the board and thankfully we did that."
Fellow loan player Jon Toral, who joined Rangers from Arsenal in January, was also keen to praise Murty.
"It was massive for Graeme on Wednesday," said the Spaniard. "He has put a lot of effort into the other games as well, he has really helped us and for us to give him that first league win was crucial.
"At the minute we are just thinking about the cup tie on Saturday and then whatever happens happens. If a new manager has until the end of the season to work with the players and then to kick on next season it would be great for the club."
