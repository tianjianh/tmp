The war in Syria has been going on for almost four years now, and around ten million people have had to flee their homes.
The children we spoke to from Syria are just some of the refugees who had to leave their homes to avoid the fighting, and now go to a school in the Jabal al-Taj area of the capital city Amman in Jordan.
They spoke about their lives before the war, and what they do in their spare time.
