Strange and rare amphibian olm eggs ready to hatch

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A strange and rare 'dragon-like' creature called an olm has laid eggs in a cave in Slovenia in Eastern Europe visited by a million tourists every year.

Olms are blind salamanders, a type of amphibian, and live in caves. They're thought to live for more than 100 years but reproduce just once or twice every ten years.
Scientists are excited because a female olm in the Postojna Cave has laid 50-60 eggs - and three of them are now showing signs of growth.
It takes eggs around 120 days to hatch and nobody knows how many of them will survive.
