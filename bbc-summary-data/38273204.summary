[SN]TITLE[SN]
Macclesfield Town 1-2 Bromley

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Blair Turgott's late goal extended Macclesfield's poor run at home by earning Bromley victory in the National League.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Turgott netted just a minute after Paul Lewis' 84th-minute equaliser - the Silkmen's first home goal in any competition since 1 October.
Tobi Sho-Silva netted the opener on 35 minutes when Turgott scuffed a shot from outside the area that fell kindly for the striker, who had time to take a touch and pick his spot past Craig Ross.
Danny Rowe crashed a volley against the bar before Lewis' deserved equaliser, but Bromley hit back immediately when Turgott netted from a tight angle after Connor Dymond's cross was cleared to him.
