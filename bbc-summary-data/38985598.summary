Check out this video of a police officer in Birdsville, Queensland in Australia frying an egg on the bonnet of his car.
Temperatures in the region often reach 45 degrees Celsius at the height of the summer.
With temperatures hitting 46 degrees, police in the outback town decided to put the heat to the test.
Leaving a pan under the glare of the sun, the officer is seen cracking an egg in -  and getting his lunch on the go!
