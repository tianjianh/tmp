Super League: Catalans Dragons 23-18 Hull FC

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Tony Gigot's late try snatched a first win for Catalans Dragons in six league and cup games in a hard-fought victory against Hull FC, who ended with 12 men.

Luke Walsh's clever kick against the grain was chased down by the France full-back to put the Dragons back in front in a topsy-turvy game.
Catalans led 9-6 at half-time, Walsh's goals added to tries apiece from Sam Moa and Albert Kelly respectively.
Two Nick Rawsthorne scores put Hull ahead, before Gigot's score settled it.
Hull's Liam Watts was sent off late on for a high tackle on opposite number Remi Casty, and not even a desperate late flurry from Hull could prevent a third defeat in nine days.
There was plenty of bite and niggle from both teams, with Catalans pair Moa and Arthur Romano heading for spells in the sin-bin in a feisty game.
It was only two weeks earlier that Lee Radford's side had demolished Catalans Dragons 62-0 at the KCOM Stadium in the Challenge Cup.
However, the Dragons seemed fired up for this game by their need for points to boost fading hopes of a top eight finish, amid a run of form which cost club legend Laurent Frayssinous his job as head coach.
The interim coaching staff of Jerome Guisset, Michael Monaghan and Alex Chan lost their first game in charge at high-flying Salford on Friday, but there was a different look to the team on home turf.
Although there will be concerns about their defensive frailty at times, they showed character to come back from behind as the fatigue of two games in four days started to show for both teams.
For Radford, there will disappointment this game slipped away when seemingly won, while they were also denied by the video referee on two occasions when Josh Griffin and Steve Michaels thought they had scored.
