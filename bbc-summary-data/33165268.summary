Maggie Lieu, 24, from Coventry, was among 100 people picked to join the Dutch Mars One project, of whom 40 will be selected to travel to the planet.
Ms Lieu said she "didn't want to be tied to a contract", and wants to complete her PhD.
The project plans to set up a permanent human settlement on the planet by 2024.
Ms Lieu announced her intention to withdraw from the project on Twitter.
In a statement, she said: "Having reviewed my position with the Mars One project, I realised that I didn't want to be tied to a contract that didn't suit me going forward.
"I very much want to complete my PhD in astronomy at the University of Birmingham, as well as continue with my public engagement and outreach activities, which I am extremely passionate about.
"I can now concentrate my efforts on pursuing these goals."
She added she felt "truly honoured" to have been picked as one of the 100 candidates.
"I wish the project every success in achieving what will be a remarkable feat for mankind," she said.
Ms Lieu had originally said although she would never be able to see her friends and family again, she would be able to write them emails, which would be "good enough".
She told the BBC in February: "If I really did go I think my mum would be quite upset.
"She's only got one daughter, but I did go away to university for a whole year and it wasn't that bad because I called home every day."
Mars One said six candidates had not been able to proceed with the selection process.
"Maggie is indeed one of them," it said in a statement.
"We will add six candidates to replace them. We are still in the process of completing confirmation of these candidates."
