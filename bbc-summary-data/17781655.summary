Metropolitan Police officers face new race claim

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man has filed a complaint against six Metropolitan Police officers on the grounds of racism following his arrest in Harrow, north London.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Edric Kennedy-Macfoy, 28, claims police arrested and used a Taser on him because he is black.
Both the Met's Directorate of Professional Standards and the Independent Police Complaints Commission are investigating.
The Met said the man had "not alleged any racist comments were made".
The complainant said he had approached officers as they dealt with a party and that his treatment by them was "motivated by factors relating to race".
Mr Kennedy-Macfoy, a fireman, claims he was driving through Harrow last September when he saw a youth throw a rock at a police van.
He then approached officers at the scene to give a description of the youth, his lawyer said.
Mr Kennedy-Macfoy was later charged with obstructing police during the incident but was cleared by a court.
In the early hours of 4 September police were called to reports of a noisy party in Harrow View where more than 200 people were present.
When police decided to shut the party, "bottles and bricks" were thrown at officers, four of whom received minor injuries, the Met said.
Mr Kennedy-Macfoy arrived at the scene in a car and approached officers.
Police used a Taser on him, arrested him and later charged him with obstructing police. But in February he was found not guilty at Brent Magistrates' Court.
Shamik Dutta, Mr Kennedy-Macfoy's solicitor, said: "The situation that my client has had to suffer has been horrific, not just in terms of the force that was used upon him during his arrest and subsequently being locked up in a police cell for many hours, but then having to face a prosecution, where if he had been found guilty he could have lost his job and it would have ruined his life.
"People who have suffered discrimination can sometimes find it difficult to prove if racist language has not been used against them.
"However, in this case, the inspector who gave evidence at our client's trial in the magistrates [court] was very clear; race was a significant factor in why Mr Kennedy-Macfoy was treated in this way."
In a statement, the Met said: "A complaint regarding the conduct of six officers was received on 21 September alleging that officers arrested and detained a 28-year old man without good cause, assaulted him during the arrest, that the officers were insulting and the way in which he was treated was motivated by factors relating to race.
"The misconduct investigation did not proceed whilst criminal proceedings were ongoing. The complaint letter was received from the complainant's solicitors outlining the precise details on 12 April."
The Met said: "Such allegations are taken extremely seriously and the investigation will explore all the circumstances and evidence.
"The complainant has not alleged any racist comments were made."
The complaint is against an inspector, a sergeant, a detective constable, two PCs from Harrow borough and one PC from the Diplomatic Protection Group.
"Two officers are from a BME (black minority ethnic) background and the rest are white," the Met added.
