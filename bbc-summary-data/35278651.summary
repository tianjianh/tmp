[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
World number one Jordan Spieth matched Tiger Woods by winning his seventh PGA Tour event before the age of 23 with a dominant victory at Hawaii's Tournament of Champions.

The 22 year old cruised to an eight-shot win over Patrick Reed after a six-under-par 67 at the Kapalua Resort on the island of Maui.
Spieth won the Masters and the US Open in 2015 and wants more success.
He said: "I'll try and continue exactly what we were doing last year."
Spieth held a five-shot lead going into Sunday's final round and was never troubled, hitting seven birdies to post a 30-under total of 262.
He became only the second player to finish a 72-hole event on the PGA Tour at 30-under par or lower, emulating South African Ernie Els who won the 2003 Tournament of Champions with a 31-under score.
Asked how he felt after matching 14-times major winner Woods with a seventh PGA Tour victory, Spieth said: "I don't think there's any reason to compare. What Tiger's done, I can't imagine ever being done again, but it's nice to be in that company."
