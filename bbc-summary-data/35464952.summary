The former Netherlands Under-21 international could make his Town debut against Preston on Saturday.
Terriers boss David Wagner said: "I believe his qualities will fit with our ideas. I'm sure he can help us out this season."
Meanwhile, Town have recalled forward Jordy Hiwula, 21, from his season-long loan at Wigan.
He scored six goals in 16 appearances for the League One side.
