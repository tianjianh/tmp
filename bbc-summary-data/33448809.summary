Capability Brown Blenheim Palace sketch fails to sell

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A sketch showing plans for the grounds at Blenheim Palace by the landscape architect Lancelot "Capability" Brown has failed to sell at auction.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The pen, ink and watercolour sketch, on three pieces of paper, shows the garden plan across the lake from Blenheim Palace towards Woodstock.
Auction house Bonhams said the sketch was "extremely rare" as much of Brown's work remains in private collections.
It was expected to fetch about Â£100,000 when auctioned in London earlier.
The sketch was gifted to the town of Woodstock in the 1930s by the 10th Duke of Marlborough.
Brown created over 170 parks and gardens for some of the country's grandest houses including Warwick Castle, Warwickshire and Harewood House in Leeds.
