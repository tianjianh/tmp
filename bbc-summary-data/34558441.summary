Aston Villa 1-2 Swansea City

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Andre Ayew scored a late winner for Swansea to pile more pressure on Aston Villa boss Tim Sherwood.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The midfielder side-footed in a Kyle Naughton cross to give Swansea a first win in six games.
Andre's brother Jordan had given Villa the lead with a stooping header before Gylfi Sigurdsson curled in a 25-yard free-kick to level.
Villa's sixth straight defeat sees them remain second bottom of the Premier League, four points from safety.
Home defender Joleon Lescott had a chance to equalise late on when he found space at a corner but hooked a shot over.

Relive Swansea's win over Aston Villa
Sherwood, whose team have won only once all season, had likened this game to a cup final in the build-up.

The club's hierarchy were also reportedly looking at the games against Chelsea and Swansea to judge the side - Villa have lost both.
They survived a Swansea chance when Federico Fernandez skied a shot from close range as both sides struggled to stamp any kind of authority on the game.
Fernandez was involved in a clash with Villa centre-back Micah Richards before the latter was also involved in a heated exchange with Swansea skipper Ashley Williams when he attempted to intervene.
Jordan Ayew gave Villa hope with his first goal for the club but the hosts led for only six minutes.
There was a family affair with Jordan and Andre Ayew on opposing sides and both midfielders played a key part for their sides.
The pair played against each other in the French league last season and Jordan's team won on that occasion, but this time their fortunes were reversed.
Andre should have put the visitors in front when he was played through on goal by Bafetimbi Gomis only for his shot to be saved by on-rushing keeper Brad Guzan

Villa counter-attacked from the resulting corner, with Jordan nodding in Gabriel Agbonlahor's cross.
However, Swansea responded impressively and Andre atoned for his earlier miss as he scored the winner from six yards after a dangerous low cross by Naughton.
"We are unlucky and we have a lot of new players," said Jordan. "Every week we are getting better and we have to continue to do that.
"We are always behind the manager. He is behind us and we are all together and there is no problem."
On Andre, he added: "We are family, there is no problem."
Aston Villa manager Tim Sherwood: "I'm disappointed with result. I didn't think we deserved to lose. We can't carry anyone because we're getting done.
"I said to the boys every one has to play to their maximum to get anything from a game. At the moment we are short.
"The boys gave everything. There's no shortage in desire but the quality is not quite there."
Swansea boss Garry Monk: "The period that we have been in and the way we have been playing, it was good to get the three points in the way we did.
"All of it has been a bit of a circus this week. It was about getting through this period. Hopefully, we can get some momentum now."
"Concerning speculation about his role, Monk added: "I don't concentrate on it. I don't focus on it. I focus myself and group on football."
Aston Villa are at Southampton on Wednesday for a League Cup fourth-round tie before a trip to Sherwood's former club Tottenham in the league. Swansea host Arsenal in the Premier League next Saturday.
