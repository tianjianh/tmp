[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Colin Hughes was attacked in Old Swan in September 2010 as he went to investigate a noise at the door of his  home.
Two men, aged 18 and 21, from Old Swan and Huyton, were arrested on suspicion of murder on Tuesday.
Detectives have arrested six people as part of the inquiry, but no-one has been charged.
Mr Hughes had been playing cards with his fiancee Paula Greenwood when they heard the glass in the back door smash at about 0045 BST on 21 September.
Ms Greenwood went to call the police while Mr Hughes, a chef at a local pub, went to investigate. She later found him lying face down in the garden.
He was taken to hospital but died soon afterwards. A post-mortem examination found he died from a single stab wound.
