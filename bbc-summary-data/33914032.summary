John van der Put, a comic and magician who performs as Piff the Magic Dragon, and ventriloquist Paul Zerdin were two of seven acts put through on Wednesday.
Both received "golden buzzers" on their first auditions, immediately advancing them to the competition's live rounds.
Zerdin is an established comedian in the UK who has performed twice at the Royal Variety Performance.
Both he and van der Put - who performs with Mr Piffles, a Chihuahua in a dragon costume - were born and raised in London.
Van der Putt, who has his own show in Las Vegas, had to fly out of the US after his America's Got Talent appearance to fly to the Edinburgh Fesitval, where his Breakfast at Piffany's, opens on Friday.
Writing on Instagram, Zerdin said: "Wow what a week! Thanks so much to everyone who voted me through! I'm already working on the next spot!"
Stand-up comedian Drew Lynch, singer Samantha Johnson and Japanese dance group Siro-A were also put through in the latest edition.
Two more quarter-finals will be held before the show advances to the annual competition's semi-final stage.
Former Spice Girl Mel B and German supermodel Heidi Klum are among the judges on this season, the programme's 10th.
