Powys council recovers £4m invested in Icelandic banks

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Powys council has been successful in recovering the money it invested in Icelandic banks prior to them going under in 2008.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The council had invested £4m in two separate banks - £2m each in Glitnir and Landsbanki.
It was one of eight councils, three universities and three former police authorities to have invested almost £75m of public money.
Powys council said the process has been a "long and complicated issue."
Of the £4m it invested, it recovered £4,077,799, which includes interest payments and legal costs.
