At the 2015 British Fashion Awards, Jonathan Anderson became the first person to be named both the menswear and womenswear designer of the year.
The exhibition will feature his designs as well as those by the likes of Christian Dior and Jean Paul Gaultier.
They will be alongside work by artists like Barbara Hepworth and Henry Moore.
The 31-year-old designer has confessed to being "obsessed" with 20th Century British art and cited the likes of Moore, Hepworth and Graham Sutherland as inspirations.
He promises "provocative" combinations as work by artists Louise Bourgeois, Sarah Lucas and Dorothea Tanning is "brought into direct dialogue" with garments by Rei Kawakubo, Helmut Lang and Issey Miyake.
Anderson said: "This is a rare and exciting opportunity for me to bring together some of the works of art and fashion that long inspired my own creative work and to see what happens when these objects rub up against each other.
"I want the exhibition to mirror the speed and unexpected encounters that characterise the way in which we consume images today, as well as being a space in which to explore ideas of gender and identity that have been an ongoing part of my creative practice."
The designer, from Northern Ireland, is known for blurring the line between men's and womenswear and streamed a menswear show on gay social networking app Grindr in January.
The exhibition, titled Disobedient Bodies, will run from 18 March to 18 June 2017.
