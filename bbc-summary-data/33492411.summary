John Murphy, 52, has been missing from his home in Dennistoun, Glasgow, since 12 May when he left home at about 07:00 to go to work, but failed to turn up.
A man of a similar appearance was captured on CCTV in a Lidl store in nearby Duke Street at 15:18 on 13 June.
Detectives are keen to eliminate the sighting from the inquiry.
They said Mr Murphy's wife and children were "distraught" at his disappearance, which was out of character.
Ch Insp David Pettigrew said: "We're issuing these images today in an effort to identify the man in them. They were taken at 3.18pm within Lidl supermarket on Duke Street on June 13, which is over a month since John went missing.
"Due to the camera position we are unable to be certain if the man in the images is John.
"As we try to determine this we have issued the images in an attempt to identify this man and I would ask that if this is you, please come forward so that we can eliminate this sighting from the inquiry."
After leaving his home in Craigpark Drive on the morning of 12 May, Mr Murphy headed towards Duke Street to catch a bus to work.
He is about 5ft 8in tall, of medium build, with short brown hair which is turning grey. He is normally clean shaven and is believed to have been wearing a cream polo shirt, black cargo trousers, black work boots and a black fleece jacket.
Mr Pettigrew said: "John's family and friends are distraught at his disappearance, which is being felt so keenly within the community.
"I'd like to take this opportunity to ask the local communities of the east end to get in touch with us if you have any information which could help with our inquiry."
