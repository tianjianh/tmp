Some minor formalities of the deal have still to be completed, but the 25-year-old flew to Poland on Thursday.
Pogon Szczecin announced on their website that the former Dundee United forward will wear the number 17 jersey and he has already trained with the side.
"It's good for him to get some games," said Celtic manager Brendan Rodgers.
"It's been difficult for him because of the form of the other strikers here, but you have to give him massive credit because he's been totally professional and a great guy to have around the squad.
"I gave him some game time lately as a reward really for his hard work and endeavour. But he's a striker and they want to play and score goals. This is a chance for him to get some games between now and the end of the season."
Turkey under-19 cap Ciftci had a spell on loan last season in his home country at Eskisehirspor, playing 12 games and scoring four goals, but has made only four appearances for Celtic this season.
He joined Celtic from Dundee United in the summer of 2015 during Ronny Deila's tenure as manager and has scored four goals for the Glasgow side.
Pogon are seventh in Ekstraklasa after 21 of their 30 league games.
