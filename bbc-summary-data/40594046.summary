The body of Omar Omran was found at an apartment in the Riverside complex, Kimmage, on Monday evening. He had been stabbed to death.
His mother Maha Al Adheem, a doctor who is originally from Iraq, appeared at Dublin District Court on Thursday.
The 42 year old was remanded in custody until next week.
During the hearing, a detective sergeant gave evidence of the arrest.
He said that about 45 minutes after she was charged, Maha Al Adheem said: "Yes it was my knife. Yes it was my hand.
"It was not me.  It was the power."
