An Israeli soldier has been detained after a video emerged showing him apparently shooting a Palestinian in the head as he lay wounded and motionless on the ground.

The Palestinian was soon declared dead. He was one of two attackers who had earlier stabbed another Israeli soldier in the West Bank city of Hebron.
The Israeli military said the shooting was a "grave breach of IDF (Israel Defense Forces) values".
The soldier has not been identified.
"In light of the initial probe into the incident, a military police investigation has been launched," the Israeli army said on Thursday.
The shooting occurred just minutes after two Palestinian attackers stabbed an IDF soldier at a checkpoint in Hebron.
The Palestinian shown in the video was shot and wounded during the attack.
Footage filmed by a bystander then shows one of Israeli soldiers appearing to take aim and fire a shot into the Palestinian's head.
Officials said the Israeli soldier stabbed earlier was in stable condition.
At least 29 Israelis have been killed in a wave of stabbing, shooting or car-ramming attacks by Palestinians or Israeli Arabs since October.
More than 180 Palestinians - mostly attackers, Israel says - have also been killed in that period.
The assailants who have been killed have been shot dead either by their victims or by security forces as they carried out attacks. Some attackers have been arrested.
Other Palestinians have been killed in clashes with Israeli troops.
