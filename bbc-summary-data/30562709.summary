Craig Ferguson has hosted his last edition of US TV programme The Late Late Show after a run of 10 years.

The Glasgow-born presenter insisted that he was not retiring, saying: "I'm not stopping doing it, I'm stopping doing this."
The 52-year-old's role will be filled by British actor and presenter James Corden from 23 March.
Ferguson's final guest was Jay Leno, who bowed out of hosting The Tonight Show earlier this year.
The pair spoke about the pitfalls of presenting chat shows, while Leno said that it was "fun being a comedian again instead of a talk show host".
According to reports from Hollywood, Ferguson, who fronted the late night show on CBS for 2,058 episodes, is expected to present a new early evening programme.
But he remained tight-lipped about the precise nature of his future plans during his final appearance.
Corden, known for presenting the Brit Awards and starring in sitcom Gavin and Stacey, was confirmed as the new Late Late Show presenter in September and made an appearance on the programme on Wednesday.
The 36-year-old said he was "hugely excited" to host the programme and would do his best "to make a show that America will enjoy".
The actor's profile in the US was boosted in 2012 when he won a Tony for his role in the Broadway transfer of stage hit One Man, Two Guvnors.
He was recently seen alongside Keira Knightley in the musical romance Begin Again and has a role in big-screen musical Into the Woods, released in the US on Christmas Day.
