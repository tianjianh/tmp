Review of Bord na Gaidhlig long overdue, says professor

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An academic who advised Scottish ministers to set up Gaelic development body Bord na Gaidhlig has said a review of its work was "long overdue".

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Prof Donald Meek said the 12-year-old Inverness-based organisation needed to "look seriously" at its purpose.
Last month, its chief executive Iain Campbell quit after three months in the job.
The board said it was unable to directly to the remarks, but said work had started towards an evaluation.
Joe Moore, who does not speak Gaelic, has been appointed interim chief executive following Mr Campbell's resignation.
Prof Meek said: "When a chairman departs after three months that is bad news.
"It is bad news for the Gaels but it is also giving a bad impression of the Gaels to the rest of Scotland.
"The board has got to look seriously at its own purpose. There needs to be a thorough review and audit of whether it is really doing what it ought to have been doing."
He said the board had "lost its way", adding: "A review of what the board is doing is long overdue."
Bord na Gaidhlig works to promote Gaelic in partnership with the Scottish government and other Gaelic organisations.
