In the Name of Peace - John Hume in America was screened at the 29th Galway Film Fleadh on Thursday.
The documentary features interviews with former US Presidents Bill Clinton and Jimmy Carter.
It is directed by Maurice Fitzpatrick and narrated by Liam Neeson.
The film charts the relationships that the former SDLP leader cultivated at the White House and in the US Congress.
In the documentary, his former SDLP deputy, Seamus Mallon, argues Hume should be regarded alongside Irish leaders Charles Stewart Parnell and Daniel O'Connell.
It features contributions from former Prime Ministers Tony Blair and John Major, as well as interviews with Sinn FÃ©in leader Gerry Adams, DUP MP Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, U2 singer Bono and journalist Eamonn McCann.
In the 1990s, Mr Hume was diagnosed with dementia and has struggled with the disease.
The premiere was followed by a panel discussion on John Hume's role in building peace with former Taoiseach Bertie Ahern and SDLP South Belfast MLA Claire Hanna.
