Guernsey storm-hit borrowing funding plea for coastline

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Money should be borrowed from next year's budget to repair storm-hit sections of Guernsey's coastline, a senior constable has said.

Fermain sea wall and steps going down to Petit Port were damaged in the winter storms.
Gerry Tattersall, senior constable for St Martin's, said borrowing the money would speed-up the repairs otherwise tourism could be affected.
The Environment Department said it was prioritising other "urgent works".
A 10m (33ft) section of the Fermain sea wall fell away after being battered by waves and high winds in January.
In May, the steps down to Petit Port Bay were shut "for the foreseeable future" due to the undermining of the cliff.
Mr Tattersall said: "Petit Port can't cost very much in States terms, a few thousand pounds, so I don't see any reason for delaying that."
He said that tourism could suffer as a result of the damage not being repaired.
The Environment Department said it has "focussed resources on the urgent works required to the island's coastal defences".
"Unlike Fermain and Petit Port, these defences protect Guernsey's essential infrastructure and, as such, they must take precedence.
"Options for addressing the damage at Fermain are now being prepared, including short term works before the winter."
It added that an update would be issued as soon as possible.
