About 1,300 properties in Scone were left without gas on Tuesday night after a gas main was damaged.
Scotia Gas Network (SGN) said about 800 properties in the village have had their supplies restored.
SGN said residents will receive Â£30 compensation for each 24 hour period without gas.
Residents were urged to ensure that engineers were able to access the property.
A statement on SGN's website said: "Our engineers worked late into the night and managed to restore gas supplies to around 800 of the affected properties.
"We're continuing to work hard to visit all of the remaining properties and turn their gas supply back on.
"Please remember we need access to your property to do this.
"If you've arranged to leave a key with a neighbour, if possible, please make one of our engineers aware."
The company said it had pumped out more than 10,000 litres before it discovered the additional water during final checks.
An incident van offering assistance is parked near the Scone Arms.
SGN is offering electric hotplates and heaters to elderly and vulnerable customers while the repairs are carried out.
Engineers traced the source of the flooding on Wednesday night.
SGN has drafted engineers from across Scotland to help switch off gas supplies in the village at the meter.
