Sussex's Joyce will not feature until the one-day series against Afghanistan later this month after undergoing knee surgery before Christmas.
Peter Chase replaces Joyce, 38, in the Ireland squad for the games in Dubai.
Bowler Boyd Rankin is also being rested this week before rejoining the squad for the Afghanistan games in India.
Coach John Bracewell has to decide whether Gary Wilson or recalled Niall O'Brien will keep wicket on Thursday.
O'Brien missed the recent Desert T20 tournament in the Emirates while Middlesex seamer Tim Murtagh also returns to the Ireland squad.
After this week's one-day games, Ireland will travel to Greater Noida in India for nine matches against Afghanistan across three different formats.
