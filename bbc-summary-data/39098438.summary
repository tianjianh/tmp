The cash will fund extra triage and resuscitation areas as well as more treatment rooms at Ysbyty Gwynedd, Bangor.
Paediatrics facilities and waiting rooms will also be improved.
Health Secretary Vaughan Gething said it would make "a real difference to patients accessing emergency and urgent care in north west Wales".
Gary Doherty, chief executive at Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board, said: "The current department is too small and is not designed to meet the requirements of modern clinical practice.
"This major scheme will provide state-of-the-art accommodation for the 52,000 patients who use the service each year and will help us transform medical and emergency care."
The funding is for 2017-20, with work expected to start in March.
