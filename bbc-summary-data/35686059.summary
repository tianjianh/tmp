The middle one of the six holes dug on Carn Liath even has steps cut to its entrance.
Expertly dug snow holes can be used by climbers and hillwalkers as emergency shelters from bad weather.
A group from the Joint Service Mountain Training Centre in Ballachulish has claimed credit for the holes on Carn Liath.
It had been thought that a group from Plas y Brenin, the Welsh national mountain sports centre in Conwy, dug them.
The quality of the snow holes has earned praise from the Sportscotland Avalanche Information Service (SAIS).
One of the service's forecasters described the evenly spaced snow holes as "aspirational".
Carn Liath is a 3,300ft (1,006ft) is on the fringes of the massive Creag Meagaidh plateau in the Highlands.
The area is one of six covered by SAIS.
The snow hole building on Carn Liath was done during a recent spell of cold but calm weather that followed heavy snowfalls.
Warmer and windier weather has been forecast for the next few days.
The avalanche risk remains classed as "considerable" in the areas SAIS covers.
