The Audio and Radio Industry (Aria) Awards are the successors to the Sony Awards, the top honours in UK radio.
Evans beat rivals including BBC Radio 1's Nick Grimshaw and Absolute Radio's Christian O'Connell.
BBC Radio 4's Today programme was named best national speech breakfast show at the ceremony in Leeds on Wednesday.
Today editor Jamie Angus gave "big thanks to our listeners" and the Aria judges for the award on Twitter.
BBC 5 live and Radio Ulster's Stephen Nolan won the prize for best speech broadcaster, just days after he picked up the Nick Clarke Award for the best BBC interview of the year.
And BBC 1Xtra's Mistajam was named best music broadcaster at the awards, which were handed out by the Radio Academy.
Jazz singer Jamie Cullum, a runner-up in the music broadcaster category, later congratulated "real life legend" Mistajam on his victory.
Rick Astley, Gregory Porter and the Kaiser Chiefs performed live at the ceremony, hosted by BBC Radio's Sara Cox.
The presenter tweeted afterwards that it had been "a brilliant night".
