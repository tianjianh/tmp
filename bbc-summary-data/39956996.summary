Tottenham will not try to compete with clubs offering huge wages to transfer targets, says boss Mauricio Pochettino.

Spurs will finish second in the Premier League to qualify for the Champions League group stages for a second year in a row, but Pochettino says that is not enough to attract certain players.
"If some club is paying double the salary, then how can you convince them?" said the Argentine.
"It's all about if you pay or not when we talk about top players."
The 45-year-old added: "You need younger players, like [England midfielder] Dele Alli, who preferred to come here than another club.
"We took a big risk on Dele and now he is a massive player, one of the most important in England. But who took the risk? Us."
Spurs travel to last season's champions Leicester City on Thursday for their penultimate game of the season.
After their final match at Hull on Sunday, Pochettino's squad will fly to Hong Kong for a five-day post-season tour.
Tottenham will also go on a 10-day pre-season tour to the United States at the end of July, which includes friendlies against Paris St-Germain, Roma and Manchester City.
Earlier, Pochettino said he was committed to staying at the club and denied reports of a buy-out clause in his contract.
In May 2016 he signed a contract extension committing him to the north London club until 2021.
"There is no reason to leave," he said. "I will be here for pre-season. There is no buy-out clause in my contract. I will stay here next season."
