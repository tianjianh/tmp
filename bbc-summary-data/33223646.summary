The court heard that forensic computer experts recovered 56,165 indecent images of children.
More than 1,300 involved children aged between four and 15 years old being raped by men.

Defence lawyer Ed Hulme told the court Green had an addiction to pornography.
He will be sentenced for the offence next month.
