DF Concerts are behind plans for a non-camping music festival in July 2017.
The three-day event would take place about the same time as T in the Park, which is currently staged at Strathallan Castle in Perthshire.
Glasgow City Council said it was not interested in becoming an alternative venue for the main festival.
A council spokesman said:  "We will not be, and are not interested in, hosting T in the Park."
He added: "We are in discussions with DF Concerts about hosting a non-camping festival in the city next July."
T in the Park, which attracts tens of thousands of festival-goers from across the UK, featured the Stone Roses and Calvin Harris among its 2016 headliners.
