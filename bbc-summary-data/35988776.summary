[SN]TITLE[SN]
Bangor face court action over debts

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Irish League club Bangor are facing a High Court battle for survival over alleged outstanding debts.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A winding-up petition has been issued against the club in connection with the installation of a 3G pitch at their Clandeboye Road ground.
On Thursday, a judge agreed to a two-week adjournment, but suggested proceedings could be approaching "the end of the line".
Bangor's all-weather playing surface has been in use since 2013.
It was hoped the pitch would generate additional revenue for a club that was founded in 1918 and who enjoyed Irish Cup success back in 1993.
Outstanding debts for work on the project are believed to have led to the court action.
Before Thursday's court action, Bangor expressed confidence that a resolution would be reached.
Bangor are fifth in Championship One, the second division in the Irish League set-up.
Since being relegated from the Premiership in 1996, they have only had one season in the top flight.
