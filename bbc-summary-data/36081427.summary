World Athletics 2017: Children to pay £9.58 for London tickets

Children will pay just £9.58 for a ticket to watch the 2017 World Championships at the Olympic Stadium in London, including the men's 100m final.

The price matches the time Usain Bolt ran to set a new 100m world record at the 2009 championships in Berlin.
Adult tickets for the 4-13 August event will start at £20, with two thirds - around 250,000 - costing £35 or less.
Tickets go on sale to the public at 10:00 BST on 1 August, 2016, with 700,000 available via ballot.
People should register their interest in purchasing tickets on the London 2017 website.
Organisers have also announced prices for the 2017 IPC Athletics World Championships, which take place at the same venue from 14-23 July.
Tickets start at just £10 for adults, with children paying £5 for every session. Around 500,000 of the 800,000 tickets cost £20 or less.
"I always say that the children are the future," said Bolt, who won triple Olympic gold at the venue in 2012.
"I commend the organisers of London 2017 on this initiative to give young people the chance to buy affordable tickets.
"I hope it will inspire many of them to get into athletics and look forward to seeing many young people filling seats next summer."
