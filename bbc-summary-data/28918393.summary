The internet trend involves people posting videos online of them having water poured over them. The aim is to raise money and awareness for charity.
Actor McAvoy challenged both Mr Salmond and Better Together chairman Alistair Darling to take part.
Prime Minister David Cameron was among those nominated by Mr Salmond, along with his deputy Nicola Sturgeon.
Ms Sturgeon took up the challenge moments later.
A government source said David Cameron would not take part in the ice bucket challenge. However, he will make a donation to a motor neurone disease charity.
Mr Salmond, who took the challenge to raise awareness of motor neurone disease, also nominated "every single member of the Scottish press corps" but singled out BBC Scotland political editor Brian Taylor, who has since had his soaking.
Ms Sturgeon nominated Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg, Scottish Labour leader Johann Lamont and her colleague, Scottish Sports Secretary Shona Robison.
Mr Darling took the ice bucket challenge on Friday afternoon then nominated the staff of Better Together.
X-Men star McAvoy was nominated by Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho.
In his video, he said: "As it is the year of the Scottish referendum, I'd like to nominate our political champions Alistair Darling and Alex Salmond to do their very worst".
As the iced water poured over him, he said: "Alex/Alistair - you have got 24 hours".
Both politicians accepted the challenge on Friday but as Mr Salmond waited until Sunday to complete it he did not meet McAvoy's deadline.
Mr Salmond said on Friday: "I'm always up for any challenge, and I'm game for this one.
"It will invigorate me for the next month of campaigning - but the Scottish media should be careful what they wish for, as I get to nominate who's next for the ice bucket!"
On Friday afternoon Mr Darling tweeted: "Just took the #IceBucketChallenge for http://gordonsfightback.com. Video coming soon... Thanks James McAvoy."
