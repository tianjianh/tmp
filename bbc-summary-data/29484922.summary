The wheelchair collects data to gather information to flag emergencies - for example when a user has slumped forward.
It can also monitor that the chair itself is functioning properly.
The robotics student, Tim Balz, actually secured a patent for a similar idea while he was in high school.
Developers can also use the information to make apps which will enhance a wheelchair user's experience.
He says one application would be to feed in the location information to crowdsource accessibility around cities.
Tim showed the BBC's North America technology correspondent Richard Taylor how the wheelchair works.
