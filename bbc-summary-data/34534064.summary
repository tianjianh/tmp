Jose Mourinho: Chelsea manager fined by FA for comments

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho has been given a suspended one-match stadium ban and fined Â£50,000 by the Football Association for comments made about match officials.

Mourinho had claimed officials were "afraid" to award his team penalties after Robert Madley denied Chelsea a spot-kick in a 3-1 loss to Southampton.
The FA charged that his comments "imply bias on the part of a match official".
Mourinho's ban will only be enforced if he repeats the offence within a year.
The home defeat by Southampton was Chelsea's fourth loss in the defending champions' opening eight Premier League games of the season and left them 10 points behind leaders Manchester City and four points above the relegation zone.
Speaking after the game, Mourinho had said the Blues were "always punished" by officials because "there is always a question mark" from the media.
"If the Football Association wants to punish me they can. They don't punish other managers," he added.
A Chelsea spokesperson told BBC Sport the club would wait to read the FA's full reasoning before making any comment on the verdict.
Mourinho was charged hours after the Blues said the Portuguese retained their "full support" following back-to-back defeats.
His side return to Premier League action at home to Aston Villa - four points and two places below them - on Saturday.
