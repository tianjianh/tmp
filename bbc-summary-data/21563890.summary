The final Twilight film has swept the board at Hollywood's Razzie awards, which highlight the year's worst films.

Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn Part 2 was given seven Golden Raspberry titles including worst picture and worst actress for Kristen Stewart.
Stewart, who is presenting an award at the Oscars on Sunday, was not present at the spoof award ceremony.
Instead, a cardboard cut-out of the actress was brought in to the press conference to "accept" her trophy.
The five Twilight films have made a total of $3bn (Â£1.9bn) at the box office.
Razzies founder John Wilson said the worst thing about the franchise was that "people take it so seriously".
"I believe that rather than 40 million girls who bought tickets, it was four million girls who bought 10 tickets each," he added. "That makes me feel better about the American public."
The film also "won" the worst director prize for Bill Condon, worst supporting actor for Taylor Lautner, worst re-make, rip-off or sequel, worst screen ensemble and worst screen couple for Lautner and Mackenzie Foy.
Stewart owes her worst actress prize to her performances in two films - Twilight and Snow White and the Huntsman.
The Razzies are described by the organisers as "saluting the worst that Hollywood has to offer each year". The prize for each category is a gold-coloured raspberry trophy.
Winners rarely turn up to claim their prizes at the Los Angeles ceremony, and Stewart was no exception.
Pop star Rihanna was named worst supporting actress for her debut film role in Battleship, based on the board game of the same name.
The singer has just 68 lines of dialogue in the action movie, including lines such as "Kentucky fried chicken!", "Boom", "Yeah" and "Sucker's really jumping around".
John Wilson described Rihanna as "Rambert - a female Rambo".
"She's following in the footsteps of Mariah Carey, Jennifer Lopez and Madonna - singers who really can't act but get paid millions of dollars anyway."
Razzies veteran Adam Sandler was named worst actor for his role in That's My Boy. The film also won worst script.
Last year, the event was moved from its traditional Oscars-eve slot to April Fools' Day.
But voters of the Golden Raspberry Award Foundation said they preferred handing their prizes out the night before the Oscars, so the event was shifted back to that slot for 2013.
