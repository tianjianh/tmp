County Championship: Nottinghamshire collapse hands Surrey advantage

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Surrey dismissed Nottinghamshire cheaply on day three and forged a 385-run lead as they edged closer to a first Championship win of 2016.

Notts resumed on 82-2 but were bowled out for 182 before lunch, with spinner Gareth Batty (4-23) removing the visitors' top scorer Michael Lumb (48).
That gave Surrey a lead of 141 runs, and they reached 244-5 by the close.
Arun Harinath (83) registered his second half-century of the match at The Oval, while Kumar Sangakkara made 49.
Surrey are the only side in Division One yet to record a victory this season, but will hope to change that statistic on Wednesday having seized full control on the third morning.
Ravi Rampaul (2-26) started the procession of Nottinghamshire wickets, trapping Brendan Taylor lbw, while the mix-up that saw Samit Patel run out for 12 left them 132-5.
Lumb, who had hit three One-Day Cup centuries in the period since Notts' previous Championship outing, was bowled by Batty attempting to cut a straight ball and the Surrey skipper ran through the tail to secure a sizeable first-innings advantage.
Harinath, who made 73 in Surrey's first innings, was supported well by Rory Burns (34), Sangakkara and Steven Davies (45 not out) as the hosts consolidated their strong position.
However, as opener Harinath looked to accelerate before the close, he became one of three second-innings victims for Brett Hutton (3-61).
Surrey batsman Arun Harinath told BBC Radio London:
"It's been a very good day. The bowlers set the platform, were disciplined and patient, and it was up to the batters then to build on that and get as good a lead as possible.
"When we do that we suffocate sides, but it's been difficult to do it consistently this year.
"I've been playing well all year, I just need to cash in and score more runs, that's what's best for the team and best for myself.
"As long as I keep putting the team in winning positions, I'm happy."
