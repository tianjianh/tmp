Former Scotland captain Barry Ferguson has urged Gordon Strachan to ask Andy Murray into the Scotland dressing-room ahead of Friday's game with England.

And the head coach has told BBC Scotland that it "has been mentioned".
The Scots hope the new world number one tennis player will be at Wembley for the World Cup Group F qualifier.
"Somebody said he was going to the game on Friday - get him in to do the team meeting," Clyde manager Ferguson told BBC Radio Scotland's Sportsound.
"I would love somebody like that to come in and talk.
"If you know he is going to the game on Friday, get him in, or even at the hotel - get him to come in for half an hour pre-match for a chat.
"He is the best sportsman just now and, for him to just walk through those doors, whether it be pre-match or at Wembley, what a lift that would give you."
BBC Scotland understands Murray has been invited to Wembley by the Scotland camp, but his commitments in the lead-up to the ATP World Tour Finals, which start in London on Sunday, may prevent him from taking up the offer.
Scotland assistant Mark McGhee had earlier told a media conference that "my understanding is that he is coming to the game".
BBC Scotland's Chick Young sent a text to Strachan pointing out Ferguson's idea of a Murray team-talk.
"Has been mentioned," was the reply. "Thanks anyway. Really appreciate it.
"Real disappointment is that Leigh Griffiths hasn't grown this week. See you later," Strachan added in reference to the previous comments about the Celtic striker not having the physical presence up front that the head coach requires.
Ferguson thinks that Scotland's players would be in awe of Murray even though they themselves are top sportsmen.
"If he walked in the room, I wouldn't know what to say," he admitted. "I would be nervous.
"That's a guy who hates losing and that's what we need to do on Friday, so let's get him in the dressing-room.
"You wouldn't even need a team talk if that guy walked in. The guys would just look at him and think that's what we've got to do."
Ferguson played in a 1-0 victory over England at Wembley in 1999.
Scotland failed to overturn a 2-0 first-leg deficit as the English qualified for the Euro 2000 finals, but the former Birmingham City, Blackburn Rovers, Blackpool and Rangers midfielder thinks the underdogs could win again on Friday.
"We went down there with no fear because I think they had a bit of arrogance about them and it was about how many they were going to take off us," he added.
"We knew they had better players. They had world-class players. We had good players, but we played better as a team and I think that's the way it is just now with England.
"England have world class players, but they don't play well as a team.
"So that's our chance. We have to get in their faces, play with a lot of heart and hopefully we can take something away."
