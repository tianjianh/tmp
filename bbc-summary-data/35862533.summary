Scott Brown has been the best player during Gordon Strachan's time as Scotland manager, according to assistant boss Mark McGhee.

Brown is set to win his 50th cap next week in the second of two forthcoming friendlies against Denmark at Hampden.
"I would argue that he's been our best player since we have been here," said McGhee, assistant since 2013.
"A lot of people have done really well - don't get me wrong. But consistently I think Scott has done a great job."
McGhee is confident Brown, 30, who made his international debut in 2005, still has a major appetite to represent Scotland as preparations begin for the 2018 World Cup qualifiers, which start in September.
Scotland have been drawn in a group with England, Slovakia, Slovenia, Lithuania and Malta.
"We are glad he is still around," added the Motherwell manager.  "[This will be his] 50th cap; he has got another 20 or 30 in him.
"I think the challenge he gets here is different from the challenge he gets at his club, and he rises to it and he really enjoys it.
"I think with the England game, he will want to be part of that."
Scotland have called up Fulham striker Ross McCormack and Birmingham right-back Paul Caddis to replace Steven Naismith, who has a hamstring injury, and Steven Whittaker - whose wife is due to give birth - for Thursday's friendly in the Czech Republic.
Scotland then host Denmark at Hampden Park on Tuesday, 29 March.
