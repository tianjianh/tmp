Police are re-investigating child sex abuse allegations against a farmer who shot himself shortly after he was told he would be questioned.

Gordon Dawson, from Dalby, Lincolnshire, was found dead with a gun at his side in 2007.
His accuser, known only as David, criticised police over the original investigation and for telling the farmer he was about to be arrested.
Lincolnshire Police said it was now acting on new information.
The renewed inquiry was first reported by Buzzfeed News.
Supt Rick Hatton said: "The force has reviewed the original file and spoken further with the victim.
"As a result of this, investigations are ongoing into the original allegation and further details that have come to light."

David claimed Mr Dawson had repeatedly abused him from the age of 15 after the farmer befriended his family and started taking him for shooting lessons.
He told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme that Mr Dawson had also taken him to London where he was abused by other men at an apartment in Dolphin Square.
David reported the farmer in 2007, but said his alleged abuser then killed himself the next day as police failed to remove his guns, despite warnings.
"It was tough when I heard he had taken his own life - I just couldn't believe they [the police] would warn people," he added.
According to Lincolnshire Police, the first allegation against Mr Dawson was made in 1999 but no action was taken due to "insufficient evidence".
In 2006 police arrested Mr Dawson after four other men came forward claiming they were also abused as children between 1964 and 1986.
An investigating officer phoned Mr Dawson on 23 March 2007 to tell him he would be questioned further and a few hours later he was found dead at his home.
After Mr Dawson's death the investigation was dropped but David later complained to the police about the way it was handled.
