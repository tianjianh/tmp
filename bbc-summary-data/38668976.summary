Legal challenge to York Community Stadium plan fails

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A legal challenge over plans for an 8,000-seat community stadium complex has failed.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The challenge, brought by Vue Cinemas, centred on the City of York Council's decision to allow a larger cinema on the site than originally proposed.
The council initially approved a 12-screen design but later gave permission for a 13th screen and 400 extra seats.
The judge found the decision-making process to be correct. Vue Cinemas has not commented on the decision.

The 12-screen Vue cinema at the Clifton Moor Centre is one of three in York.
The additional screen and extra seating at the stadium site at Monks Cross on the outskirts of the city were approved in June 2016.
The council said it welcomed the court decision and said in a statement it was a "great step forward".
The stadium development has suffered a number of delays since it was first proposed in 2009.
It was originally forecast to cost Â£37m and open in spring 2017 but is now expected to cost an additional Â£7m and will not be operational until next year.
In December, the main contractor announced it was withdrawing from the plans.
The stadium is due to become home to York City FC and York City Knights Rugby League Club alongside leisure, retail, office and community facilities.
