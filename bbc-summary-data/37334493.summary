Cue Card almost landed the hat-trick last season when winning the Betfair Chase and King George VI Chase before falling in the Cheltenham Gold Cup.
Joe Tizzard, the horse's assistant trainer, said Cue Card would be aimed at the treble again.
"This is brilliant news. That's what he'll be aiming at this time," he said.
Jockey Club Racecourses managing director Paul Fisher said the bonus was covered by an insurance policy.

26 December 2016 - King George VI Chase, Kempton, three miles
17 March 2017 - Cheltenham Gold Cup, three miles two furlongs 70 yards
If successful, the bonus would be awarded as follows:

£150,000 - Trainer
£100,000 - Jockey (£33,333 per race if different riders)
£100,000 - Split between winning stable's staff
