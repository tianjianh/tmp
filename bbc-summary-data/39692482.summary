The 32-year-old former Sheffield Wednesday man has played 262 times for the club and helped them gain promotion to the Championship in 2015.
It follows news that long-term keeper David Martin is also leaving, while captain Dean Lewington said earlier this month his future is undecided.
"I shall now be seeking a new challenge elsewhere," Potter said.
"I would like to say a huge thank-you to the fans, who have been nothing but fantastic to myself and my family during my time here."
