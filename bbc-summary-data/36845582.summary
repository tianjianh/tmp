The 30-year-old arrived at Turf Moor in 2013 after being released by Bristol City.
Heaton made his England debut against Australia in May and was part of the Euro 2016 squad.
"I really want to kick on and push that boundary now and see where I can get to," he told the club website.
Heaton has started every league match for Burnley during his three years at the club.
