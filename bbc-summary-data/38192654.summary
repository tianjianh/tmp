[SN]TITLE[SN]
Port Vale 2-3 Northampton Town

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Northampton ended a four-game losing streak as they ran out winners over Port Vale at Vale Park.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Goals from Gabriel Zakuani, Sam Hoskins and Paul Anderson secured Vale's former boss Rob Page all three points on his first return to his former club, with Ryan Taylor and Rigino Cicilia replying for the home side.
The visitors took the lead after 22 minutes when Zakuani beat his marker and stooped to powerfully head home Matt Taylor's out-swinging corner.
A bit of fortune helped Vale back into the game seven minutes into the second half when Taylor miscued a shot following a corner, only for the ball to land at his feet before slotting into the empty net.
Northampton went ahead 12 minutes from time when the ball fell to Hoskins in the six-yard box following a corner, before he smashed home into the roof of the net.
The Cobblers increased their advantage at the end of 90 minutes when Paul Anderson tapped home after Jak Alnwick twice denied Marc Richards.
Cicilia pulled one back for Vale two minutes into stoppage time but it was not enough as Northampton held on.
