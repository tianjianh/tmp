According to the Hollywood Reporter, the film will focus on the scandal of Wright and his mistress, Martha 'Mamah' Cheney, who was murdered in 1914.
Cheney, her two children and four others were killed by a domestic worker at Wright's home while he was away.
"It's a very good script," Beresford said of Nicholas Meyer's screenplay.
Meyer also directed two of the Star Trek movies.
"There's a documentary by Ken Burns but it's odd that there's never been a film about him," Beresford told the Hollywood Reporter.
The 1998 documentary was made by Oscar-winner Burns, who picked up an Academy Award for his film about the Statue of Liberty.
Beresford is currently scouting for locations in and around Chicago. Casting is yet to be announced.
Wright is considered by many to be one of the 20th Century's greatest architects. He designed over 1,000 buildings, 532 of which were completed.
His Ennis House, designed in the style of a Mayan temple, was bought for $4.5m (Â£2.8m) earlier this year.
Built in 1924, the house overlooks Hollywood Hills in Los Angeles and has featured in films including Blade Runner, House on Haunted Hill and Grand Canyon.
Wright also designed the Guggenheim Museum in New York.
