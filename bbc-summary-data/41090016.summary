Root declared late on day four, setting West Indies a target of 322, 10 days after they beat the tourists by an innings and 209 runs in the first Test.
He said that was a "positive decision" to try to win the Test.
"If we were right on it and took all of our chances it might have been slightly different," Root said.
"It was spinning. It was the fifth day. We are a positive side who want to win Test matches - unfortunately we weren't able to do that.
"At no point were we complacent."
England coach Trevor Bayliss said the decision to declare was a "very good" one that he left to Root and vice-captain Ben Stokes.
The hosts dropped three catches on the final day but Root said it was their performance on the first two days that "really hurt" them.
England were bowled out for just 258 on day one, and West Indies had a lead of 71 for the loss of five wickets by the end of the second day.
Root did however say that the way his side fought back into the match was a positive.
"Previously we might not have found a way back into the game," he said.
"I thought it was a real step forward for this side, finding a way to show fight and character to get into a position so we could declare."
Batsmen Mark Stoneman and Dawid Malan both made gritty half-centuries in England's second innings.
Both are at the start of their Test careers and looking to secure a place in the side for this winter's Ashes series.
"Stoneman looks like a tough player, a natural player," Bayliss said.
"Both he and Malan spent a fair time out in the middle and that will do them the world of good."
The defeat is England's second under Root's captaincy and ends a run of three victories in a row.
"It keeps us focused," Bayliss said.
"After the last few Tests people have been saying we were in a good place for Ashes, well we have lost this one and it will keep the guys grounded.
"They will come out in the next match and show us what they have got."
