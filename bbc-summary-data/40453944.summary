The Mega Week and Dip into Paradise prize-winning ticket was drawn on 3 February.
It has the winning UK Millionaire Maker code ZXPR 17675 but no-one has come forward.
The ticket-holder only has until 2 August to make their claim.
Andy Carter, senior winners' advisor at The National Lottery, said: "We're urging everyone to check their old tickets one final time or look anywhere a missing EuroMillions ticket could be hiding.
"This life-changing prize could really help to make dreams become a reality for someone out there."
If no-one comes forward, the money plus interest will go towards National Lottery-funded projects across the UK.
