Povetkin, 36, tested positive for "low concentrations" of meldonium in April.
On Sunday, WBC president Mauricio Sulaiman confirmed on Twitter that the fight would not take place as scheduled on 21 May in Moscow.
The World Anti-Doping Agency said in September it was adding meldonium to its banned list from 1 January, 2016.
Recent Wada figures showed there had been 172 positive tests for the drug this year - 27 of those involving Russians.
