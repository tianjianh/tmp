Russell Brand has tweeted a picture of the business card of a senior Daily Mail reporter, encouraging his 8.7 million followers to contact him.

It was after the reporter Neil Sears had apparently called on the comedian to question him over his tax affairs.
But Brand received a less than positive response on Twitter.
Soon after he deleted the reporter's mobile number and email, but not before some said they had contacted him.
Some Twitter users, including former Daily Mirror editor Pier Morgan, complained that targeting the journalist was unfair, and threatened to report Brand to Twitter.
One wrote: "We take a break from our study on the woodland toilet habits of bears to tell you that Russell Brand can be very immature."
While another posted: "Unwise of Mr. Brand to tweet phone numbers, whoever they belong to."
Twitter's rules state that users can't publish someone's private information without their consent.
Russell Brand has thrown himself into political activism recently but a YouGov poll of 2,000 people found he's the celebrity seen as having the most "negative influence" on political debate.
He also recently teamed up with Limerick comic duo The Rubber Bandits for a 'Parklife' parody.
The comedian made the video after a tweet by someone pointed out the similarity between the two, which went viral with people recording parodies and mashups.
