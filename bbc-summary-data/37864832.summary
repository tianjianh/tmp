Kevin Fortey, 38, from Cwmbran, Torfaen, needed permission from the UK government before the pair of vegetables could be flown 5,700-miles.
He said an inspector checked them to ensure there were no signs of pests before issuing him a certificate.
The 6ft-long, 6kg (15lbs) leeks were flown out on Wednesday to form part of the programme by broadcaster NHK.
Mr Fortey works in local government but grows giant vegetables as a hobby.
The programme-makers saw him and his giant vegetables at the Malvern Autumn Show and then filmed him at home and other events.
They asked to be sent two leeks, but Mr Fortey had to have a visit from an official from the Department for Environment Food & Rural Affairs (Defra) to check his produce with a magnifying glass before they could be sent to Asia.
"When I did the filming, they were making us kiss the leeks so God knows what will appear on the TV programme in December," he said.
Mr Fortey, who grows a variety of giant vegetables, said he feeds them on items including chicken pellets and a seaweed spray.
