Mount Etna erupts for the fifth time this year

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Europe's most active volcano, Mount Etna, has erupted for the fifth time this year.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Hot lava and ash spewed from the top into a valley nearby on the Italian island of Sicily.
The eruption happened on Sunday morning at 4am local time for more than an hour and a half.
Although the area around the volcano was covered by ash, it didn't affect planes travelling near it.
Air traffic can be seriously affected when ash from volcanic eruptions is in the air.
In 2010, the Eyjafjallajokull volcano in Iceland erupted and flights in Europe and across the Atlantic were cancelled because the ash particles in the air made it unsafe to fly.
