Essex Police had a call about an Audi RS3 being driven erratically at Wickham Bishops near Witham on Friday evening.
Shortly after the police car began its pursuit, the driver lost control, hit a telegraph pole and crashed into the field off Maldon Road.
The two male officers inside the car had minor injuries. The Audi has yet to be located.
Essex Police said the Audi was believed to have been stolen from Allectus Way in Witham on Friday evening.
The squad car, which crashed at 18:45 GMT, contained a police constable in his 30s and a special constable in his late teens, Essex Police said.
Special Inspector Jo van Zanten tweeted photographs of the crashed car and called it "a lucky escape for two Braintree officers".
