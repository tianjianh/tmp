Andrew Holland: Cyclist dragged toddler along pavement

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A cyclist who ran down a toddler and dragged her 12ft (3.6m) along a pavement has admitted dangerous cycling.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Andrew Holland, 24 of Campbell Avenue, Blackpool, collided with three-year-old Lucie Wilding as she stepped out of her front gate.
Holland was ordered to pay Â£829 in fines and costs by Lancaster magistrates.
Footage captured on the family's CCTV camera was played to the court.
The child suffered scrapes, bruises and bumps to the head and her parents said she is still suffering from anxiety.
Lucie's mother, Lauren Howarth, said: "There was just blood all down the side of her face and she was just screaming, just screaming.
"It was awful. All she was doing was just stepping outside her front gate. Never for one minute would I ever think that a cyclist would hit my daughter on the pavement."
Leaving court Holland said he had written to the family to apologise, a claim denied by Lucie's parents.
