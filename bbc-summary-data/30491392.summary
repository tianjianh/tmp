[SN]TITLE[SN]
Health Secretary apology over Stafford Hospital death

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The family of a man who died after being sent home from hospital with an undiagnosed ruptured spleen has had an apology from the health secretary.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
John Moore-Robinson, 20, died at his Leicestershire home in 2006 after staff at Stafford Hospital failed to notice the severity of his injuries.
In September, a second inquest found his death could have been prevented.
His father Frank said he would ask Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt why no one was facing disciplinary action.
Mr Moore-Robinson, from Sileby, near Leicester, was admitted to hospital after a mountain bike accident on Cannock Chase.
He was diagnosed with bruised ribs but collapsed hours later. The subsequent inquest returned a narrative verdict.
It later emerged parts of an internal report criticising Mr Moore-Robinson's care had been withheld.
After a report into wider problems at Stafford Hospital, a second inquest was ordered and this found six separate shortcomings at the hospital's A&E all of which contributed to his death.
Mr Robinson said: "(This apology) is the first communication we have had from the Department of Health in eight years.
"But after all the apologies we have had it rings hollow, it feels a little meaningless.
"It will be an interesting discussion (when we meet Jeremy Hunt) . We would like people who wronged John, and did wrong after he died, to be held to account."
Mr Robinson and his wife Janet are due to meet Mr Hunt in January.
