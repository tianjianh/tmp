Healthcare model 'hard to sustain' as financial pressures mount

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Northern Ireland's Public Accounts Committee has said it is hard to see how the local health and social care model can be sustained as financial savings start to dry up.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The committee has voiced serious concerns over the financial stability of the health trusts.
The criticisms are made in its general report on the health sector.
It also raised concern over breaches in hospital waiting time targets, especially for cancer patients.
Some of the recommendations are targeted at helping the trusts break even.
The report found that despite only the Western Trust failing to break even in 2014-15, with a deficit of Â£6.6m, this masks an underlying funding gap for trusts from that year.
The funding gap is reckoned to be over Â£131m. This will be carried forward to 2015-16.
The report makes now familiar criticisms associated with high levels of spending on locum doctors as well as what it described as the "mediocre" implementation of Transforming Your Care.
The report suggests that Northern Ireland could follow Scotland's lead and benefit from a three-year budget, instead of the constraints of an annual budget in which money cannot be carried over.
The chairperson of the committee, Michaela Boyle, said the health and social care bodies are facing an unprecedented financial squeeze.
"Although the health and social care sector has been more generously funded than other areas of public spending over recent years, it faces an ever increasing demand for its services," she said.
"This is partially as a result of an ageing population as well as increasing chronic conditions such as diabetes.
"Putting the health and social care trusts on a sustainable footing is a major challenge, unless there is a significant change in funding or transformation of services.
"One significant problem that the health and social care trusts face is that they are unable to carry forward unused funds from one year to the next, impeding their ability to undertake longer-term financial planning."
Among the other recommendations in the report is a call for the health department to provide a detailed explanation of how it will tackle the issue of consultant shortages.
It also calls on the health service to redesign the way it provides services. Failing to do so will mean trusts will find it difficult to operate within their budgets.
The report also highlights Northern Ireland's heavy reliance on locum doctors.
It repeats previous criticism that the practice adds to the trusts' increasing spend, particularly within the Western Trust where difficulties in recruiting and keeping permanent consultants continues to put pressure on budgets.
