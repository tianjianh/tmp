Nadir Ciftci: Six-match suspension for biting

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Nadir Ciftci will miss Celtic's opening six Premiership matches after being found guilty of biting Jim McAlister in last season's Dundee derby.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 23-year-old striker was given an eight-match ban with two suspended for "excessive misconduct".
Ciftci, who moved from Dundee United for Â£1.5m earlier this month, will not appeal against the ban.
The ban was decided by a panel convened by the Scottish Football Association after Ciftci denied the offence.
The incident took place during United's 3-0 victory at Tannadice on 24 May, in which Ciftci scored twice.
Referee Bobby Madden took no action at the time.
Following the match, the Tannadice club accused Dundee players of "quite severe physical and totally unacceptable verbal provocation" towards Ciftci.
McAlister, 29, is currently training with Blackpool having been released by Dundee.
Both players attended Monday's hearing at Hampden Park.
Ciftci, who began his career with Portsmouth before a spell with Kayserispor, moved to Tannadice from Dutch club Breda in 2013 and went on to score 33 goals in two seasons.
He will remain available for Celtic's Champions League qualifying campaign after making his debut in their 2-0 first-leg win over Stjarnan in the second qualifying round.
