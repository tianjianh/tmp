Stevenage are up to 21st with Newport slipping to 22nd, still 11 points clear of the League Two drop zone.
The hosts were ahead on ten minutes, Jake Mulraney heading home from Tom Pett's cross before former Newport favourite Aaron O'Connor scored against his old club.
Alex Rodman fired in a late consolation for Newport.
The Exiles have failed to win since 5 March and have drawn one and lost eight of their last nine, including losing six in a row for the first time in 11-years.
Stevenage caretaker boss Darren Sarll told BBC Three Counties Radio:

"The points were going to be the targets for the day, and the performance would be secondary to that.
"Ultimately, it was the win we wanted and the win we deserved.
"I thought we were brilliant in the first half, but we were poor in the second.  It felt two days long and we looked anxious and nervous.
"We have been in good from lately, so we will go into next week with the belief that we can see off the problems we are facing and enjoy the rest of the season."
Newport manager Warren Feeney told BBC Wales Sport:
"We lost the game in the first half today and I can take people having bad games but I can't take people having no desire and no hunger and unfortunately today in the first half we showed that.
"Without a doubt it was the worst 45 minutes since I've been here.
"I don't want to lose football games.
"It's a mentality thing for me. You can't get into a lull of losing football matches and they've had it all season unfortunately.
"I've every confidence we will stay up but you shouldn't just be buzzing to stay up."
