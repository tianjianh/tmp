Ryan Bennett: Middlesbrough make enquiry for Norwich City defender

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Newly-promoted Premier League side Middlesbrough have made an enquiry about Norwich City defender Ryan Bennett.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 26-year-old played 26 times for the Canaries last season as they were relegated from the top flight.
Hull and Celtic have also been linked with Bennett, but Boro are thought to be the only club to have made their interest known.
Norwich are keen to keep Bennett at Carrow Road next season.
