Trump trailed China's Liang Wenbo 6-3 overnight and lost the first frame.
But Trump won five in a row - and seven of the next eight - to progress and will face China's Ding Junhui next.
Qualifier Kyren Wilson became the last man into the second round after a thrilling 10-9 win over Joe Perry.

Both matches delivered nerve-jangling tension and high-quality snooker at snooker's showpiece event.
A relieved Trump delivered on his promise to fund a few drinks for his fans.
"I will put a couple of hundred quid behind the bar at The Graduate and whoever comes in first can have a free drink," he said after earlier promising as much on Twitter.

In the evening session, the final first-round match was even tighter, with a 57-minute frame won by Perry forcing a decider.
Shanghai Masters champion Wilson was 5-4 ahead overnight only to fall 8-7 behind.
But the Kettering man persevered with the attacking style and fearless long-potting and he finished with six half-centuries and two tons in his victory.
"It was a fantastic match and the way snooker should be played. Fans love a decider," said Wilson. "I come to tournaments believing I can win but try not to get too far ahead of myself."
The afternoon drama came in seeing world number five Trump keep his Crucible quest alive against an increasingly nervy Liang.
Trump's generous gesture to buy drinks for his fans will hardly make a dent in his wallet, having already assured himself of £22,000 for reaching the second round at the Crucible.
The 26-year-old's prize money looked like being just the £13,250 reserved for first-round losers as UK Championship runner-up Liang took the opening frame of the morning.
But the Bristolian stopped the rot in a scrappy 11th frame and looked a different player after scoring a majestic ton to win the 13th.
Liang levelled at 8-8 but Trump closed out the win with ease.
"It seemed like when I had my back against the wall that's when I thrived," added Trump. "I played some real good snooker, just solid snooker. I wasn't forcing it really."
Seven-time world champion Stephen Hendry on BBC Two: "Judd Trump was my tip at the start of the tournament. I think he should have won the title by now but he's maturing, working harder and taking his career more seriously. He came into the tournament in form and he's going to take some beating."
Thursday's late session also saw two-time World Championship runner-up Ali Carter lead veteran Scot Alan McManus 5-3 in their second-round meeting.
In the other round two match, world number 14 Marco Fu took a 5-3 lead over Scotland's Anthony McGill.
