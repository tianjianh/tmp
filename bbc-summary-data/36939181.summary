[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Bradley Moore, who was in his 40s, died in hospital after an attack in Warrington Street, Ashton-under-Lyne, on Wednesday night.
All four defendants, aged between 12 and 17, appeared at Manchester Crown Court.
The 12-year-old was remanded into local authority accommodation.
His co-accused were placed in youth detention custody.
Family members of the defendants were in court for the short preliminary hearing.
As the youngest defendant was led from the dock, he could be seen to blow a kiss at his mother.
Judge Patrick Field QC set a provisional trial date for January next year. A plea hearing will take place on August.
A bail application will be made on behalf of the 12-year-old boy at the same court on Wednesday.
All four had appeared before magistrates in Oldham earlier.
