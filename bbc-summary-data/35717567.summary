The man was walking with two other men in West Regent Street, near Blythswood Square, at about 04:00 on Sunday, when they were confronted by three men.
Two of the three men then repeatedly kicked the 23-year-old victim.
All three men ran off and were seen in a small, light-coloured car driven by a woman eastbound along West Regent Street, near Blythswood Street.
The victim's two companions were uninjured and managed to run off westbound on West Regent Street.
One of the suspects was described as being white, in his mid-20s, about 6ft tall, of large build. He had short dark hair and was wearing dark clothing.
The other man was described as white, in his mid-20s, about 6ft tall and of medium build. He was wearing grey clothing.
There is no description for the other man or the woman.
Det Con Vikki Reid, of Police Scotland, said: "At this time we have not established a motive for this attack and I am appealing to anyone who witnessed the incident to contact police immediately.
"I'm particularly anxious to speak to the driver and any passengers of a dark-coloured private hire vehicle that was seen in the vicinity at the time the assault took place."
