Brunt, 24, has not played a competitive game since damaging cruciate knee ligaments in March 2016.
He has yet to play 90 minutes for the League Two Grecians, but scored in a friendly against Taunton Town.
"We are confident that we will get him back to full fitness and he will be an important member of our squad," said Exeter boss Paul Tisdale.
