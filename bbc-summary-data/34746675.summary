Send your astronaut training questions

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Newsround is off to a special astronaut training base called Star City in Moscow, Russia, and we want your help for when we get there.

The team is going to see the final, high-tech, training that Britain's Tim Peake will be going through before he blasts off for the International Space Station.
He's preparing for a five-month mission where he will perform onboard experiments and orbit earth more than 2,700 times.
Hayley will be interviewing Tim at the training base and we want you to send in some questions for him to answer.
This page is now closed but will re-open in the morning. Thank you for your questions.
