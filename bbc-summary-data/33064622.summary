Taxi outing takes children to Yellowcraig beach

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The streets of Edinburgh have witnessed an injection of colour as the annual Edinburgh Taxi Trade Children's Outing made its way through the city.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The procession of decorated cabs ferried groups of children with special needs and illnesses for a day.
The children were taken to Yellowcraig beach in East Lothian.
The tradition, which dates back to 1965, sees prizes awarded for fancy dress and unsuspecting passers-by soaked by water pistols.
