[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Twelve-man Hull KR denied Warrington the chance to move level on points with second placed Wigan in Super League after a late try from Iain Thornley.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Warrington had come from behind to lead 16-10 with three minutes to play.
James Webster's side had to play more than 40 minutes of the game with a man down after James Green's dismissal.
The draw, Rovers' second of the season, slightly dents their hopes of reaching the top eight of Super League and avoiding the lottery of the Qualifiers.
Four points now separate the east Hull side from Widnes in the last top-eight position, or the tussle between Super League's bottom four and the Championship quartet after the split.
It also does bitter rivals Hull FC a favour at the top, with the Black and Whites three points clear of Warrington with three regular season games remaining to decide who finishes top going into the Super 8s.
There was no let up in the intensity of a game that showed that there is still much to play for, as the altercation between former team-mates Jordan Cox and Green produced a red card at the end of the first-half.
Having led 6-0 at the break through James Donaldson's effort, Thomas Minns added a second out wide for Hull KR after smart play from Albert Kelly to stretch the lead to 10-0.
Tony Smith's side showed their mettle to strike three times, Matty Russell showing strength at the corner, Brad Dwyer touching down with a sneak from dummy half and Jack Hughes bursting away on the edge.
It looked enough to close out the match but Thornley's late effort ensured the spoils were shared.
Hull KR head coach James Webster told BBC Radio Humberside:
"I've got to commend our boys for the effort, we played 42 minutes with 12 men against a really quality side.
"We had people out of position and it was a gutsy effort but if we were better finishing our sets we might have won the game.
"Fighting is one you can't do, the games has changed but saying that there was something in it before in that we got the penalty."
Warrington head coach Tony Smith told BBC Radio Merseyside:
"We'd have liked to have closed it out. We weren't good enough from the kick-off and they come up with the ball and scored directly after.
"If you don't do things well throughout that's what happens. That what happens when you're fraught with danger. We have no one to blame but ourselves.
"Their spirit was great and we lacked a bit of that. We lacked discipline. When we went 16-10 I think everyone in the ground thought we had it, but the game is 80 minutes."
