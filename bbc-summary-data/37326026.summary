[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Silkmen made a decent start but soon found themselves on the back foot as James Constable and Jai Reason both went close for Eastleigh in the early stages.
Danny Whitaker blazed a great opportunity over the bar for the hosts in the 38th minute, before Luke Coulson scored the winner five minutes after the interval.
Constable was inches away from doubling Eastleigh's lead in the 64th minute after Reason crossed in from the byline, but in the end it did not matter as Moore's side extended their unbeaten run to seven games.
