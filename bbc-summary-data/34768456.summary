[SN]TITLE[SN]
Homes set for Swansea University's Hendrefoilan student village

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Plans for 300 new homes at Swansea University's soon-to-be closed student village are to be given the go-ahead.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Hendrefoilan site was sold in 2013 to developer St Modwen, who built the university's new Â£450m Bay campus on the outskirts of the city.
The student village houses more than 1,600 students but is surplus to requirements and by the new year, the Bay campus will hold a similar amount.
Planners at Swansea council have been recommended to approve the homes.
It is expected the university will still manage student accommodation on the site at least until the summer of 2018.
