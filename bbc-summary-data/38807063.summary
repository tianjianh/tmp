An investigation into the deaths of six dogs in Edinburgh has found no evidence so far of a link with a local park, according to the city's council.

Each of the dogs had to be put down after being walked in Forthquarter Park in Granton.
Two of the animals suffered internal bleeding.
The City of Edinburgh Council's environmental health team said there were no plans to close the park to the public.
A spokesman for the council said: "We have found no evidence so far to link the deaths of any dogs with Forthquarter Park.
"Preliminary investigations are still continuing, but the park will not be closing."
Concerns about the dogs' deaths were initially raised by the Friends of West Pilton group.
After learning of the deaths of six dogs with links to the park, they alerted the council and local politicians.
The park is owned by the National Grid and sits beside a former gasworks.
Extensive ground decontamination work was carried out before the park opened 10 years ago.
