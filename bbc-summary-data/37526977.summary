[SN]TITLE[SN]
Stevenage 1-2 Plymouth Argyle

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Leaders Plymouth extended their unbeaten run in League Two to 10 games as Sonny Bradley's double secured victory at battling Stevenage.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Argyle edged a cagey first half and almost scored on 43 minutes as Jimmy Spencer's looped effort hit the woodwork after Graham Carey had broken from midfield.
The visitors broke the deadlock soon after the restart when David Fox's free-kick evaded everyone apart from Bradley, who diverted the ball into the top corner.
Stevenage equalised just seven minutes later as Henry Cowans' low free-kick found Matthew Godden unmarked and his effort went in off Bradley from six yards.
Boro - who have now lost three of their last four league games - were only level for four minutes as Bradley glanced in a header from Carey's free-kick.
Stevenage had their chances to equalise during five minutes of injury time, with Jack King and Harry McKirdy going close, but Plymouth saw the game out to remain top of the table by five points.
