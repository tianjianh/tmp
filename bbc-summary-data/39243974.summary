Neil Warnock: Late goal 'feels like Cardiff City have lost'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Cardiff City manager Neil Warnock says they must stop conceding late goals if they are to challenge for promotion next season.

The Bluebirds drew 1-1 with Birmingham on Saturday as Lukas Jutkiewicz struck in the 89th minute.
Since Warnock was appointed in October, Cardiff have surrendered nine points by conceding goals after the 80th minute.
"They're a concern because I hate losing. It feels like you've lost," he said.
"I'd be more disappointed if it's happening in 12 months.
"That won't happen next season. All the top sides have got decent choices on the bench to change things and, at the moment, we haven't got much.
"We've got quite a few injuries and we've got to bite our tongue and get on with it.
"It looks like we're going to limp over the line."
Cardiff conceded an injury-time equaliser against Blackburn on Tuesday, while defeat at Queens Park Rangers in their previous fixture came courtesy of an 83rd-minute own goal from Jazz Richards.
Ryan Williams' added-time winner for Barnsley consigned the Bluebirds to a 4-3 home defeat in December, while on Boxing Day they were denied victory at Brentford by Sullay Kaikai's goals in the 83rd and 90th minute.
In addition to those goals, Warnock's first defeat as Cardiff manager was the result of Jordi Gomez's 86th-minute winner for Wigan in October.
Despite his players' tendency to concede late goals, Warnock's tenure has been successful, lifting Cardiff from 23rd place and deep in relegation trouble to a position of mid-table security in 13th.
They have been weakened by injuries of late, and Greg Halford limped off against Birmingham to join a growing list of absentees which includes the likes of defenders Bruno Ecuele Manga, Matt Connolly and Lee Peltier and strikers Rickie Lambert and Rhys Healey.
"Thank God it's the international break. We're a bit decimated at the moment," said Warnock.
"We've had a lot of muscle injuries as well. All credit to the lads, they've given everything for me.
"It's frustrating because I'd like to finish the season well.
"I still think there will be nine difficult games for our opponents. Some of the teams we'll play against will be more open than Birmingham were.
"I don't think there's a game we can't win so we have to keep going."
