Lucy Pygott, 17, from Hartley Wintney, and 16-year-old Stacey Burrows from Farnborough were out on a training run when they were hit by a Ford Focus.
A torch-lit procession, held exactly a week after the crash on Queen's Avenue, was followed by a two-minute silence.
Both girls were members of Aldershot, Farnham and District Athletic Club.
Lucy was this year's England Under-20 3,000m champion and European Youth Championships bronze medallist.
Stacey was the Hampshire Under-17 3,000m champion.
The club, which is based at the Aldershot Military Stadium, said the large number of flowers left at the crash scene have been moved to the stadium's car park as they were causing vehicles to stop on the road.
A serving soldier was arrested on suspicion of drink driving, two counts of causing death by dangerous driving and two counts of careless driving while unfit through drink or drugs.
He has been bailed until February.
