Chatsworth Homes began redeveloping the Gloucester Road site into a library, health centre and flats in August 2012.
Earlier this week the firm said it is "very confident" it could met a deadline of Christmas.
Mayor George Ferguson said he was "extremely frustrated" and "if it had been possible I would have pulled the plug on it long ago".
Bristol City Council lent Chatsworth Homes around Â£3.8m to develop the site but halted the project amid concerns about the quality of work.
It brought in consultants but the authority would not make the findings of their Â£40,000 report public.
"Chatsworth Homes committed to completing this development by October 2013," Mr Ferguson said.
"Concerns were being raised over the quality of the work... and surveyors found several issues of concern.
"I am appalled by the performance on this site where the developer has repeatedly failed to deliver on his promises and I have instructed officers to give urgent consideration as to where we go from here."
Chatsworth Homes is yet to comment.
