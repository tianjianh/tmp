Christopher McMultan, 40, was convicted for his part in the robbery. Earlier, Brain Martin, 58, had admitted robbery charges.
Sarah Gloag is the daughter of Ann Gloag, believed to be Scotland's richest woman.
McMultan and Martin had robbed another couple in Perthshire the previous day.
At the High Court in Edinburgh, McMultan was sentenced to 12 years in jail. Martin received a 14-year sentence.
Temporary judge Paul Arthurson QC told Martin: "It is clear that you are a highly dangerous and violent criminal.
"It is the duty of the court to impose a lengthy custodial sentence."
The court had heard how Martin and McMultan had forced their way into Sarah Gloag's Perthshire home on 19 January 2015, threatening her and husband Sundeep with knives.
They tied the couple up with masking tape before making off with jewels and cash.
Hairdresser Sarah's mum Ann Gloag - who made millions from her Stagecoach bus empire - phoned police after the robbery.
Martin, who has more than 50 convictions in a criminal career dating back to 1976, pleaded guilty to the robberies after hearing Ms Gloag give evidence.
His record includes convictions for firearms offences and assault and robbery.
The earlier raid carried out by Martin and McMultan took place at an address in Muthill in Perthshire and targeted David Gilfoyle and Joanne Miles.
