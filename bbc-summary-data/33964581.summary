The singer and TV star was "thrilled and excited" about the idea, Nick Fiveash said.
"Her manager, son Robert Willis, had been in continuous talks with a West End producer regarding early stages of planning, but obviously these are now on hold for the time being," he said.
Black is to be buried in her home city of Liverpool later this week.
Black, who emerged from the city's music scene in the 1960s before becoming the host of hit TV shows Blind Date and Surprise Surprise,  died at her villa in Estepona on the Costa del Sol on 1 August.
A coroner ruled last week that the entertainer died from an accidental traumatic head injury after a fall.
Cilla Black's early years were dramatised in a three-part ITV series in 2014 starring Sheridan Smith.
Jeff Pope's drama charted how the young Priscilla White was transformed into a chart-topping singing star.
The entertainer's funeral on Thursday will take place at St Mary's Church in the suburb of Woolton.
After the funeral, her body will be laid to rest at a private ceremony in Allerton Cemetery, where her parents are buried.
