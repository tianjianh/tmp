Australia avoided a first Test series whitewash at home with a consolation seven-wicket victory in Adelaide as South Africa won the series 2-1.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Proteas were bowled out for 250 before Australia chased 127 on the fourth evening of the day-night Test.
David Warner made 47, Steve Smith 40 and Matt Renshaw, the England-born opener, 34 not out off 137 balls.
Earlier, Stephen Cook converted his overnight 81 into 104 for South Africa as Mitchell Starc took 4-80.
Victory ended Australia's run of five successive Test defeats, and was their first in any form of cricket since beating Ireland in a one-day international in September.
South Africa's series triumph was their third in a row in Australia.
The match ended a fractious tour during which South Africa captain Faf du Plessis was fined for ball-tampering, and a member of their security staff jostled with an Australian journalist at the airport.
Australia play the first of three one-day internationals against New Zealand on 4 December before hosting Pakistan in a three-Test series from 15 December.
South Africa's next assignment is the visit of Sri Lanka, with a three-Test series starting on 26 December.
