The 29-year-old landed awkwardly after challenging for a header and was carried from the field on a stretcher.
The League Two side held Premier League Liverpool to a 0-0 draw at Anfield setting up a replay on 18 January.
"He went for a scan and it is ankle ligament damage," manager Derek Adams told the club website.
"We're waiting on the results of how long it will take for him to get back to full fitness.
"There's a lot of swelling and a lot of bruising because of the impact. Hopefully, you can quickly recover from that."
