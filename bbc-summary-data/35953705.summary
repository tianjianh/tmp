[SN]TITLE[SN]
Pollution forecast high as Saharan dust blows across South East

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Air pollution may be high in south-east England as a flow of air brings Saharan dust from north Africa.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Parts of the Kent coast are expected to be the worst-affected, the Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) has forecast.
Defra advice is for people with lung and heart problems and older people to reduce or avoid strenuous physical activity, particularly outdoors.
Asthmatics may need to use their reliever inhaler more often, it added.
Anyone experiencing discomfort such as sore eyes, cough or sore throat should also consider reducing activity.
