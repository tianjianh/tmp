The 21-year-old midfielder joined the Canaries from Swindon Town on transfer deadline day in September 2014 in a deal reportedly worth up to Â£1.3m.
The Wales Under-21 international has spent most of the past two seasons back on loan at Swindon, but made his Norwich debut in the EFL Cup in August.
He has gone on to feature three times in the Championship, with his first start coming against Leeds last month.
Thompson has also agreed an option to extend his deal for a further 12 months.
