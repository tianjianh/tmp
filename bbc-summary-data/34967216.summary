The burglary took place some time overnight on 28 November at Grange Avenue in Stockton.
Stolen presents included a Samsung Galaxy S4 tablet, children's tracksuits, three Jasper Conran dresses, electronic toys and a Makita still saw.
Cleveland Police believe some of the goods may already have been sold.
Homeowner Claire Hunter said she was devastated after discovering the theft.
She told BBC Tees: "I went downstairs and saw the paper opened, the mess.
"It was hurtful, stealing is one thing but from children at Christmas is another."
