Tunisia and Belgian coach George Leekens have parted ways, the national football federation (FTF) has confirmed.

The move comes just two weeks after hosts Tunisia crushed Djibouti 8-1 in the first match of the 2017 Africa Cup of Nations qualifying campaign.
Leekens guided Tunisia to the 2015 Cup of Nations quarter-finals.
They then suffered a controversial defeat by hosts Equatorial Guinea in the last eight.
A hotly disputed stoppage time penalty helped the home side to equalise and they triumphed 2-1 after extra time.
The FTF announced the decision to part company with Leekens on their website.
"We have decided (on) an amicable separation between the two parties without any payment on the part of FTF or George Leekens."
It is not known if Leekens, whose contract with Tunisia ran to March 2016, has lined up alternate employment.
Reigning African champions Ivory Coast are seeking a coach after Frenchman Herve Renard resigned to join Ligue 1 club Lille.
Leekens has also worked in Turkey, Algeria, Netherlands and Saudi Arabia.
Officials said the Belgian would be replaced by another foreign coach.
The next Cup of Nations qualifier for the 'Carthage Eagles' is away to Liberia during September.
