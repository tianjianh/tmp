Petrie, 38, was a flanker with Glasgow Warriors and retired from the professional game in 2007.
Scottish Rugby's Dominic McKay said: "We are delighted to appoint someone of Jonny's experience, both in business and in rugby terms.
"With Jonny's proven leadership skills, management and commercial experience, he is ideally placed for the role."
Before joining Scottish Rugby, Petrie was head of sponsorship at the energy company SSE for five years, working across sport and entertainment on such projects as the SSE Hydro and the Glasgow 2014 Commonwealth Games.
He joined Scottish Rugby in June 2014 as commercial operations manager, overseeing sponsorship projects and managing stakeholder relations.
Petrie, who won 45 caps, said he was hoping to build on Edinburgh's achievement or being the first Scottish professional team to reach a European final.
They lost to Gloucester in the final of the European Challenge Cup.
