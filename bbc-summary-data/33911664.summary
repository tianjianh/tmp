The new bridge over the Firth of Forth has become the tallest in the UK.

The three towers of the Queensferry Crossing have now reached over 160 metres as construction continues.
When complete, the towers will be more than 200 metres tall, beating the previous record by more than 40 metres.
About 1200 workers are now employed on the project, which is on schedule despite bad weather and due for completion in December 2016.
Infrastructure Secretary Keith Brown said 75% of those working at the site of the Queensferry Crossing have a home address in Scotland.
Mr Brown said construction had progressed well with recent milestones including the launch of the south approach viaduct into its final position and the installation of the first cables on the north tower.
He said: "It's great credit to the hard work and dedication of the men and women working on the Queensferry Crossing to see the progress they have made since my last visit. This is despite the challenging conditions they often face, particularly in the middle of the Forth estuary, even during the summer.
"Work is under way on every front across this vast project and workforce numbers are at a peak."
He said "significant opportunities" continued to be created for businesses, with Scottish firms awarded subcontracts and supply orders totalling ??246m out of a total figure of ??549m.
"The project team have done a great job in mitigating the effects of the recent poor weather and it is pleasing to report that the project remains on schedule to be complete by the end of 2016."
Until now the record for the tallest bridge in the UK was held jointly by the Forth Road Bridge and the Humber Bridge which have 156 metre towers.
Transport Scotland said the crossing was being delivered under budget, at about ??1.35bn to ??1.4bn.
