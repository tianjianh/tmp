The series, which has the working title Broken, will be set in Liverpool.
The BBC said it would follow Bean's character as he and his congregation struggle to reconcile their beliefs "with the hypocrisies demanded by contemporary Britain".
Bean was nominated for a Bafta and won an Emmy for playing a transvestite teacher in McGovern's Accused in 2013.
McGovern is also known for writing hard-hitting dramas including Cracker, Hillsborough, The Street and Common.
"I was very excited at the prospect of working with Jimmy McGovern again," the Sharpe and Game of Thrones actor said.
"His scripts are raw and real and he creates fantastic and interesting characters that resonate with society today."
McGovern said: "It's fantastic, because I've been trying to work with Sean again ever since he played Tracie Tremarco in Accused, which was astonishing stuff, so I'm over the moon he's jumped on board with Broken."
Bean will also serve as executive producer on the series.
