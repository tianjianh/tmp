That is up 16% on the same period last year, when work began on around 1,600 new houses.
The large majority of the 2017 housing starts, 1,699, were in the private sector.
In 2016/17 work started on a total of 7,724 new houses, the best performance since 2010/11.
That compares to more than 15,000 starts in 2005, which was the peak year.
A housing start refers to the beginning of work on a residential property, such as the laying of foundations.
