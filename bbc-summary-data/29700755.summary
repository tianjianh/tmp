Hurricane Gonzalo: 70mph winds batter Wales on Tuesday

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Gusts of wind up to 70mph battered the coast of Wales and caused travel problems elsewhere when the remains of Hurricane Gonzalo reached the UK.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
More than 400 homes in south, mid and west Wales were left without power but it has been restored to the majority.
Two vehicles were damaged when a tree fell into the road in Carmarthenshire and a Flintshire school shut its nursery due to an unsafe tree nearby.
A weather warning was lifted on Tuesday evening as conditions began to ease.
Coastguards in Swansea recorded gusts up to force nine (up to 54mph), while 70mph was also recorded at Aberdaron in Gwynedd.
Some Holyhead to Dublin ferries had to be cancelled and rail and roads were also affected.
The power cuts affected homes in Monmouthshire, Powys, Ceredigion, Rhondda Cynon Taf and Carmarthenshire, according to Western Power Distribution which published online updates about the disruptions.
Mid and West Wales Fire Service said crews were called after a large tree was blown on to two parked cars in Llangennech, Carmarthenshire, bringing down power cables and blocking the road for about an hour before being cleared.
Flintshire council said the nursery class at Ysgol Croes Atti school in Flint was shut due to health and safety reasons over an unsafe tree.
And the nearby Flintshire Bridge, linking Connah's Quay and Flint on the A548, was also shut all day.
Neighbouring Denbighshire council said the A525 Wrexham to Ruthin road had to close on the Nant y Garth Pass between B5429 (Pentre Celyn) and B5431 (Llandegla) due to a fallen tree.
And one lane on the M48 over the Severn Bridge was also closed in both directions with speed restricted to 40mph in Monmouthshire.
Meanwhile, buses replaced trains between North Llanrwst and Blaenau Ffestiniog due to flooding in Gwynedd.
Further afield, the winds have claimed a woman's life after a falling tree hit her opposite Hyde Park Barracks in London.
Hurricane Gonzalo caused widespread damage and a power blackout when it hit Bermuda last week, with damage caused to houses and power lines downed.
