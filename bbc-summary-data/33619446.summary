Grandparents' adoption refusal 'down to age'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A grandfather says a council's refusal to allow him and his wife to adopt their own grandchild was partly down to how old they are.

The couple from Essex, aged 58 and 70, were looking after the girl, three, until she was removed by social services, the Echo reported.
The grandfather, who cannot be named for legal reasons, said age was "one of two factors" behind the decision.
Southend Council said age was not the "deciding factor" in its assessments.
The girl was staying with her grandparents after her mother was hospitalised with mental health issues.
But the child was then taken into foster care, and social services obtained a court order to put her up for adoption following reports on her mother's health.
"We're very much able to care for her. We feel as though we want to dedicate our lives to our granddaughter, we love her so much," the grandfather told the BBC.
"The other factor they said was that my wife suffered from depression a few years ago.
"I can't see why we are in this position - they know we care about her. It's devastating, it breaks our hearts to be like this."
Southend Council's Executive Councillor for Children and Learning, Anne Jones, said while the authority could not comment on individual cases, age was not a deciding factor in its assessments of prospective carers.
"Though placing children in the care of relatives is our preference in all cases, we can only do so when this is consistent with the welfare of a child," she said.
The girl's grandfather said they would be appealing the family court's ruling.
"We just hope we can go through with it and bring her home to her rightful place," he said.
