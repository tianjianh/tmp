Assembly members will receive a £10,000 pay rise after next year's assembly election.

Backbenchers' pay will increase from £54,000 to £64,000 in May 2016, under a proposal that is meant to take account of further devolution.
The 18.5% pay rise was confirmed on Friday by the body which sets AMs' pay and allowances.
But the increase, first proposed six months ago, has been criticised by trade unions and all parties.
First Minister Carwyn Jones said he could not see how Labour could support the increase.
His salary will rise to £140,000, while his cabinet members will receive £100,000.
Previously the Welsh Conservatives said the party was "committed" to cutting the cost of Welsh politics, while Plaid Cymru said the proposals were "out of step with public sector pay".
The Welsh Liberal Democrats has previously argued AMs' pay should be frozen for the duration of the current assembly.
A final determination, by the assembly's independent Remuneration Board, was announced on Friday following two consultations.
Chairman Sandy Blair said: "Now the challenge moves to the political parties and Welsh public to ensure that the right candidates, who can deliver on the promise that these additional powers offer, are elected."
There are no AMs on the board and its decisions do not need the assembly's approval.
The Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority is consulting on plans to increase MPs pay by £7,000 - from £67,000 to £74,000.
