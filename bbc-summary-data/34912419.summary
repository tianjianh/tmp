Bailey, 31, left Castleford at the end of last season after making five appearances, having joined them in March after playing once for Hull KR.
The Leeds-born Great Britain and England international spent 12 years at his home town club where he worked with current Wolves coach Tony Smith.
"I am really excited by my move," Bailey told the Warrington website.
During his time at Headingley he won six Grand Finals and one Challenge Cup, but was also involved in disciplinary incidents on and off the field.
"It is no secret that Ryan has had a chequered past," Smith said.
"However he is fully aware of the special conditions set out within his contract and the standards expected of all Warrington Wolves players.
"During my time coaching Ryan at Leeds we had a fantastic relationship and I never experienced any issues."
