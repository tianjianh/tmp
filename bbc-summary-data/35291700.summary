Jordon Forster: Plymouth Argyle sign Hibernian defender on loan

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Plymouth Argyle have signed Hibernian defender Jordon Forster on loan until the end of the season.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 22-year-old has made 56 appearances for Hibs since his debut in February 2012, all but three of them starts.
He has played just once this season, in the Scottish League Cup in July, having been hampered by a hamstring injury.
Having come up through Celtic's youth academy, Forster has also had loan spells at Berwick Rangers and East Fife, but never played in England.
He could be eligible for Tuesday's game with Northampton Town in League Two if Argyle receive international clearance in time.
