Torquay United 4-3 Forest Green Rovers

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Torquay shrugged off surrendering a three-goal lead to snatch a 4-3 victory over third-placed Forest Green in the National League.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
After an uneventful first half, the hosts took the lead in the 55th minute when Nathan Blissett poked in Dan Sparkes' cross and they had a two-goal cushion 10 minutes later after David Fitzpatrick slid the ball home.
It appeared as if Torquay had wrapped up the three points on 69 minutes when Sean McGinty found the net with a header but they were stunned by three Forest Green goals in four minutes.
Substitute Christian Doidge's header gave the visitors a lifeline in the 73rd minute before Charlie Clough smashed home a second and Ethan Pinnock nodded in an equaliser.
All the momentum was with Forest Green but Ben Gerring's close-range header eight minutes from time gave Torquay a thrilling win.
