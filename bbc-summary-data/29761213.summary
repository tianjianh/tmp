Nearly four years ago, in the first few days of the Egyptian revolution, he began collecting scrap from burnt-out cars on Tahrir Square, working them into a sculpture resembling a sniper.
It was a turning-point for him, as he had previously worked with moulds and more traditional materials like granite, marble, clay and bronze.
He now sculpts exclusively from discarded junk, which he then returns to the street in its recycled form.
BBC Africa's Baya Cat met Rami at a music festival in the UK, where they took a look at some of the innovative materials the artist uses to create his street sculptures.
