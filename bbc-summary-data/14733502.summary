Cameron Jerome has signed a four-year deal with Stoke after agreeing to leave Birmingham City.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The former England U-21 striker was snapped up by the Potters for an undisclosed sum.
The 25-year-old forward has made one substitute appearance this season for the Championship club but was a regular last term - scoring five goals.
The move for the former Cardiff player comes after Stoke failed to secure Chelsea's Romelu Lukaku on loan.
Jerome was born in Huddersfield and played for his home team as a junior before moving via Grimsby Town, Sheffield Wednesday and Middlesbrough to gain a contract at Cardiff, after being recommended by reserve team manager Paul Wilkinson.
Jerome played under Wilkinson in Grimsby's youth system, but after Wilkinson left Blundell Park to take up his position with Cardiff, Jerome was released by replacement Neil Woods - allegedly for being a disruptive influence.
