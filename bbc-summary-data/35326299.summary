Coast Guard Chief Petty Officer Sara Mooers said debris was seen in the ocean. It is unclear how it happened.
Marine Capt Timothy Irish told the Associated Press news agency that a search and rescue was under way for the two CH-53 transport helicopters.
The aircraft were from the 1st Marine Aircraft Wing from Marine Corps Base Hawaii, he said.
It is not clear what caused the crash of if survivors have been found.
Ms Mooers told Los Angeles radio station KNX-AM the search would be tough because of darkness and a high surf advisory.
