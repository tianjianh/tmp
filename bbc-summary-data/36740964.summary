A new full-length portrait of the Queen commissioned to mark her 90th birthday year has been unveiled in Edinburgh - in front of the monarch herself.

Commissioned by the Royal Company of Archers, the Queen is pictured in the ceremonial robes of The Most Ancient and Most Noble Order of the Thistle.
Nicky Philipps's work, produced from a sitting at Windsor Castle, will hang in the dining room at Archers' Hall.
Her earlier portrait of the Queen was used for a Diamond Jubilee stamp.
That work is on permanent display in the Throne Room at Buckingham Palace.
Another of Philipps's paintings - a joint picture of princes William and Harry - was commissioned by the National Portrait Gallery in London in 2010.
The latest painting shows the Queen standing at the top of the staircase at Archers' Hall, the base for the Queen's Bodyguard for Scotland.
Philipps, who attended the unveiling with the Duke of Buccleuch, said: "It was an enormous privilege to paint this portrait... and I very much hope the Archers feel it is a worthy representation of our monarch."
Earlier in the day, the Queen and Duke of Edinburgh took part in a thanksgiving service for the Order of the Thistle - the greatest order of chivalry in Scotland - at Edinburgh's St Giles' Cathedral.
