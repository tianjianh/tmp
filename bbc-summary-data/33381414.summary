The US Air Force has cancelled Independence Day celebrations at a base in Norfolk, citing security concerns.

The public event at RAF Feltwell would have featured a display from the Red Arrows.
Col Robert Novotny, commander of the 48th Fighter Wing, said the two-day event had been cancelled "out of prudence... to make sure that our folks were safe."
He denied the decision played into the hands of "terrorists".
"We cancelled our picnic - we haven't cancelled a single combat sortie," he said.
"We haven't taken our foot off the throat of the enemy - none of that has changed.
"So if the terrorists consider us cancelling a picnic as a victory, I think they should readdress their calculus."
In 2013, the event was cancelled due to budget cuts.
This weekend's event was due to be hosted by US crew based at RAF Lakenheath and RAF Mildenhall.
It was cancelled a week after a gunman killed 38 people, including 30 Britons, in Tunisia.
Asked whether the cancellation related to the massacre, Col Novotny said: "There are some things which I can't share right now.
"They are not enough to significantly alter the way we do business, other than deciding having military personal from both the US Air Force and RAF is probably not the best thing to do this year.
"What we learned over the last 48 hours... gave us a great pause as to whether we wanted to have a large mass gathering on a military base.
"We decided out of prudence that we would cancel the event this year as far as to make sure that our folks were safe."
He said it was hoped the Red Arrows would return for a future display.
The Lincolnshire-based team said on Twitter: "We're sorry to say tomorrow's display and event has been cancelled by organisers."
