Nottingham care home bosses face manslaughter charge

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Three former care home bosses have appeared in court accused of manslaughter by gross negligence.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Ivy Atkin, 86, died in November 2012 days after she was moved out of the Autumn Grange care home in Nottingham.
The care home company, Sherwood Rise Limited, also faces a charge of corporate manslaughter - the first case of its kind in England and Wales.
The two men and a woman have been bailed and will appear at Nottingham Crown Court next month.
Yousef Khan, 46, from Nelson Road, Nottingham, Mohammed Khan, 38, from Zulla Road, Nottingham and Naseen Kiani, 53, from Whirlow Grange Drive, Sheffield, made their first appearance at Nottingham Magistrates' Court on Tuesday.
They jointly owned Sherwood Rise Limited, which was accused of failing to provide Mrs Atkin with adequate food and drinks and check she was taking fluids.
The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) confirmed it was the first care home company to be charged under the Corporate Manslaughter Act.
The act came into force in 2008 to clarify the criminal liabilities of companies where serious failures in health and safety result in a death.
