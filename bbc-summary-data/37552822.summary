[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A fatal accident inquiry should be held into the death of Dundee boxer Mike Towell, an MSP has said.

Conservative MSP Brian Whittle said it was important to hold a "proper inquiry" to ensure similar incidents can not happen again.
It came as prosecutors confirmed they were investigating the circumstances surrounding the boxer's death.
He died in hospital after being knocked down twice during a bout with Welsh fighter Dale Evans in Glasgow.
It has since emerged that Towell complained of headaches in the lead up to Thursday's fight, before dying in hospital the following night.
Mr Whittle, a former Olympic athlete, told BBC Radio Scotland that the 25-year-old boxer's death had been a "real tragedy".
He said banning the sport would be "silly" but it was clear that "something has gone very wrong".
"Obviously it's a high contact sport but there should be safeguards in place to prevent this kind of tragedy," he told the John Beattie programme.
"I do think we need to have a proper inquiry about this to ensure it doesn't happen again."
He added: "In my view, this is a place of work and the young man has died at his work which would then mean you should really have a full fatal accident inquiry into this.
"We need to make sure that the proper expertise is brought in because there are some anecdotal things that are being said around the fact that he wasn't particularly feeling well before he stepped into the ring.
"He was complaining of headaches etc so, to me, that sounds like there's something been missed here.
"I think it's really important that we call for a fatal accident inquiry."
Meanwhile the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service confirmed it was investigating Towell's death after receiving a report.
A spokesman said: "The investigation into the death, under the direction of Scottish Fatalities Investigation Unit (SFIU), is ongoing and the family will be kept updated in relation to any significant developments."
