The Gunners start their Women's Super League One Spring Series campaign at Sunderland on Sunday.
Ex-USA midfielder Heather O'Reilly, Scotland's Kim Little, Sunderland striker Beth Mead and Doncaster keeper Anna Moorhouse have all joined Arsenal.
"They are excellent players and we have promising young players coming through too," England's Taylor told BBC Sport.
"The club have really been showing we mean business with the players that we have brought in.
"There are also big steps we're taking off the field - big changes in professionalism - so it is an exciting time to be at Arsenal. We want to be successful and show we are a top team."
The 2016 Women's FA Cup winners have finished third in WSL 1 for the past two seasons and last finished in the top two when winning the title in 2012.
Leaving Pedro Martinez Losa's side this winter were Nigeria winger Asisat Oshoala, Republic of Ireland goalkeeper Emma Byrne, veteran England winger Rachel Yankey, Germany centre-back Josephine Henning, England defender Casey Stoney and Spain trio Vicky Losada and Natalia and Marta Corredera.
After a quarter-final loss at Birmingham City in this season's FA Cup, Losa's side's league campaign starts at the Hetton Centre against a Sunderland side that held the Blues to a draw in their Spring Series opener last Sunday.
"We cannot underestimate them," Taylor, 30, added. "No one knows much about each other at this stage."
