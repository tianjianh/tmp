Insurance agency NFU Mutual, which specialises in rural businesses, said dog attacks on sheep cost the farming industry more than Â£1.2m annually.
BBC Midlands Today's Cath Mackie visited a farm in Martin Hussingtree, Worcestershire, where a flock has been attacked three times since the beginning of the year.
The farmer is warning if he sees any more dogs among his sheep, he will shoot them.
