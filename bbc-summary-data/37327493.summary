Crowds gathered to watch Fraser Martin, in the role of King Henry III, being carried through the city and crowned by a stand-in bishop.
The ceremony marked 800 years since the actual coronation of the nine-year-old Plantagenet monarch at the cathedral.
Fraser, who won a competition to play the boy king, said: "We had to walk about and be as snotty as we could."
King Henry III was crowned as a nine-year old boy at St Peter's Abbey, the old name for Gloucester Cathedral, following the death of the infamous King John.
The event in 1216 was the last time an English or British monarch was crowned outside London and Westminster Abbey.
Fraser said playing the part of Henry was "really scary" but "kind of fun".
"I was just so excited," he said.
"The costume looks just like it would have been at the time. I got to wear a red cloak, some really weird trousers and the shoes were great, really old looking."
To get into character his mother, Francesca, said he had been practising his "regal walks and his regal looks".
Jason Smith, from Marketing Gloucester, said: "There's only been one coronation outside of London since the Norman Conquest and it happened in Gloucester and it's something we're intensely proud of."
Henry III was crowned on 28 October 1216 and died in 1272. He is the fifth longest-serving English and British monarch, ruling for 56 years and 29 days.
