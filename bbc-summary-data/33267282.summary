[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Nanteos Cup, a wooden chalice named after the mansion in Aberystwyth, was stolen from a house in Weston Under Penyard, Herefordshire, in July 2014.
It had been loaned to a seriously ill woman because of its claimed healing properties but burglars struck while the woman was in hospital.
It was found following an appeal this month on BBC One's Crimewatch Roadshow.
The cup is claimed to have been brought to Britain by Joseph of Arimathea after the death of Christ and then taken to Nanteos Mansion by seven monks from Strata Florida, Ceredigion, during the reign of Henry Vlll.
