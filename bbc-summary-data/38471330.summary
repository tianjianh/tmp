The 58-year-old won individual gold at his seventh Olympic Games in the summer.
He initially retired 16 years ago after breaking his neck in two places.
Skelton from Bedworth, Warwickshire,  became Britain's second-oldest Olympic gold medallist after a six-way jump-off at Rio 2016.
Also honoured is football referee Sian Massey-Ellis who becomes a Member of the British Empire (MBE) and hopes to inspire the next generation of female officials and footballers.
The 31-year-old from Coventry found herself at the centre of a sexism storm in January 2011, following off-air comments made about her by broadcasters Andy Gray and Richard Keys.
She said: "I love football and it is a privilege to officiate in Premier League and EFL (Football League) matches, and to have refereed at all levels of the women's game.
"On a personal level I am particularly pleased to see women's football continuing to grow and develop and hope that my role in the game can inspire girls to play football, or get involved in the sport in other ways."
Football coach Annie Zaidi from Nuneaton has received a British Empire Medal.
The 32-year-old told the BBC she faced racism, sexism and Islamophobia as a Muslim woman with South Asian heritage trying to break into coaching men's football.
She is now the head coach for Leicester City Girl's Regional Talent Club U11's and became the organisation's chairperson in January 2015.
