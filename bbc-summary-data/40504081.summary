Bowling Cemetery: Man jailed for Bradford graveside attack

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A knife-wielding man who attacked an elderly couple as they tended a grave has been jailed for 10 years.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The husband and wife, both in their 70s, were visiting Bowling Cemetery in Bradford on 10 May when they were confronted by Robert Seaman, 29.
Bradford Crown Court heard Seaman, who had been taking drugs, pushed the pair over and struck the man in the face.
Seaman, of Douglas Road, Bradford, admitted offences including robbery, assault, vehicle theft and burglary.
The court heard Seaman, who has served previous jail terms for wounding and violent handbag snatches, was carrying a knife with a six-inch blade and demanded the woman's handbag.
Prosecutor Andrew Horton said she resisted, with Seaman pushing her onto a nearby gravestone.
Her husband, who had been on his hands and knees tending to the relative's grave, had his glasses knocked off when he was hit.
Seaman fled with the handbag, which contained about Â£80 in cash as well as mementos of the woman's deceased sister, but he was later arrested.
Six days earlier he had committed a robbery at the New Beehive Inn in the city where the landlord was struck with a fire extinguisher, the court heard.
Judge Jonathan Durham Hall QC said Seaman, who had 13 previous convictions, was a very good example of the dangerous effect of crack cocaine and heroin.
He said: "You yourself admit that when taking drugs you are off the scale, therefore I must find you dangerous and act accordingly."
