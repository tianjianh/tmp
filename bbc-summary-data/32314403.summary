Burberry has credited its British-made heritage trench coats and scarves for a "robust" performance in the second half of the year.

The luxury fashion firm said total sales rose 10% to Â£1.4bn in the six months to the end of March.
Strong trading in the US and Europe helped to compensate for a drop in sales in Hong Kong, one of Burberry's most important markets.
The firm has also benefited from favourable exchange rates.
It said that if exchange rates remained at current levels, its full-year profit would be boosted by about Â£50m.
Burberry's chief executive Christopher Bailey, who took over from Angela Ahrendts in May last year, said new products had helped to boost sales.
"We anticipate external challenges will continue in the current year, but remain confident in our long-term strategy to build the Burberry brand and business globally," he added.
The firm opened seven new stores in the half-year, including flagship ones in Los Angeles and Japan's Osaka.
Burberry's shares rose almost 2% in early trading.
