Because of a condition in her legs, Josie, who is a rough collie, was starting to lose the use of her back legs and couldn't go for walks.
A fundraising page collected enough money to buy Josie a frame with wheels.
She's now getting used to moving around with the frame and is enjoying walks again with her owner Kate.
