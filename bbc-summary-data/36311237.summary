Widnes head coach Denis Betts is confident his squad will find their form after a seven-match losing streak in Super League.

Their recent run is in contrast to the way they started the season with six victories from their first seven games.
Since the end of March, the Vikings' only wins have been in the Challenge Cup against lower-league sides.
"We've got the personnel and we've got the people to spark us back into life," Betts told BBC Radio Merseyside.
"When we get rolling again I'm sure, or I'm positive, that we can really turn this year around for ourselves."
Widnes lie eighth after their poor run and face Salford at Magic Weekend on Saturday.
"The players are hurting and we've got to win," added England assistant coach Betts. "Whether it be pretty, whether it be the last second of the game, we've got to win.
"It's alright being a good group and it's alright talking about team spirit and being in it together, but not winning really hurts.
"We've got to find that win and we've got to find it some way and that's within the team and it's in those 80 minutes out there."
