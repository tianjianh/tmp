[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 19-year-old midfielder has agreed a deal until the end of the campaign, having spent most of last season on loan at the League One side.
Samuelsen, who has won three caps for Norway, had been on loan at Blackburn earlier this season but returned to West Ham after playing just four times.
He scored twice in 20 appearances for Posh last season and will be eligible to play in the FA Cup.
Samuelsen comes in as George Moncur and Nathan Oduwa returned to parent clubs Barnsley and Tottenham Hotspur after their loan spells.
