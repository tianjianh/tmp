Apprentice Boys demonstration takes place in Londonderry

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The annual Apprentice Boys demonstration has taken place in Londonderry.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The traditional opening parade took marchers and several bands around the city's historic walls.
Members of the Apprentice Boys then made their way to the Diamond for a wreath laying ceremony.
After the ceremony there was a religious service in St Columb's Church of Ireland cathedral.
A re-enactment of the Siege of Derry of 1689 was staged by a local drama group, before the main parade got under way on Saturday afternoon.
About 8,000 Apprentice Boys and 145 bands participated in the demonstration.
There was a visible police presence around the city centre.
The memorial ceremony is held on the second Saturday in August each year, to commemorate the ending of the 105-day siege of the city in August 1689.
The siege took place against the background of the deposed Catholic King James II's attempt to regain his crown from his Protestant son-in-law, King William III.
Also known as William of Orange, or King Billy, the new monarch was supported by Protestants in Derry, who shut the gates of the walled city to keep out the advancing Jacobite army.
