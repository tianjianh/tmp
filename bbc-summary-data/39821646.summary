[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Conservatives have increased their control of Northamptonshire County Council.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
All 57 seats were contested, of which the Tories took 43, compared to the 36 they won in 2013.
Labour gained a councillor, taking their tally to 12, while the Liberal Democrats saw their number of seats fall from six to two.
There will be no UKIP representatives on the council - all three of their seats were Tory gains.
Turnout was up on 2013, at 33.7%.
Heather Smith, Conservative leader on the council, said: "I'm very pleased. We've exceeded our number from four years ago and our target of 40 seats.
"We expected turnout to be low because of the general election.
"I can't foresee a bigger majority will make a difference [to how we govern]. We have to work within a certain budget."
In Northamptonshire, the Conservative party gained 8,832 votes in the local election - 45.54% of the vote.
It is higher than the national projected vote share for the Tories, which stands at 38%.
The Liberal Democrats suffered a major blow when their local leader, Brendan Glynane, lost his Delapre and Rushmere seat to Labour.
Asked about the increased Conservative majority, Mr Glynane said: "I think they will be emboldened by this.
"The finances are not sorted, there is nothing left in the bank and I think you will see some severe cuts."
As the declaration of results drew to a close, John McGhee announced he was to stand down as Labour group leader on the council.
Mr McGhee won his Kingswood ward, but said: "It's been extremely difficult watching the destruction of public services in Northamptonshire.
"I decided [to stand down] well before this election. I've been doing it so long. It has nothing to do with today's results."
