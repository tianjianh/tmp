BBC Scotland understands a neighbour discovered the man dead in the driveway of his bungalow at Anchorscross.
Police Scotland said the death of the 67-year-old was being treated as "unexplained".
A spokesperson added: "Inquiries into the full circumstances are at an early stage and ongoing."
The street is currently cordoned off and a forensics tent has been erected in the driveway.
