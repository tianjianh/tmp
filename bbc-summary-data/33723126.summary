[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Relatives of those on the missing Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 have waited for more than a year without any concrete news.

But as Malaysia's prime minister says a piece of aircraft debris that washed up on the Indian Ocean island of Reunion is "very likely" to be from a Boeing 777, family members are reflecting on whether the development will answer long-held questions about their loved ones' fate.
"There are two parts, one is that [if] they have found the aircraft, then we can have some sort of closure. Then I can give my husband the peace that he needs.
"The other part is, no, let it not be true, because then we can still have hope that there is a chance the plane is still out there and they all can come home.
"We don't know yet, we are still on pins and needles."
"Well of course we're very shocked and anxious and you just feel like you've been thrown back into that loop one more time, all over again.
"We are not... taking it as the truth, because it's happened so many times before. We're wary of the information. I think we're also holding out hope until it's confirmed. We understand that there's a high likelihood that this might be it.
"But until then we still have to hold out hope."
"The most difficult part is not knowing anything.
"We're all longing and waiting so much for any sort of news that is, you know, valid... but when we get it I think it's going to be another emotional roller coaster as well."
'It has been more than one year and now they claim to have found debris of the MH370 on an island?
"We don't accept this, we do not believe what they claim, the finding does not constitute anything.''
"I'm hopeful, in another respect, I'm not. I guess while you don't know, you still hope.
"We need to know what happened... at least if it's confirmed as a part of the plane then we can go on to the next stage which is still pretty similar to where we were before - what happened, where's the rest of the plane and where's my brother?"
"I want to say that the families of the passengers of MH370 are suffering and hurting.
"On one hand, we are hurt from the plane accident itself, on the other hand we are hurt from the inhumane, illegal, cruel and harsh attitude from the Malaysian government and Malaysia Airlines, which hurts more than the accident.
"We can't go back to our original life any more."
"We need to find the main frame of the aircraft and the bodies. Until then I will continue to believe that my son is alive."
