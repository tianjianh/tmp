Denis O'Brien injunction: Fianna Fáil calls for Irish parliament to join challenge

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Lawyers for the Irish parliament should join a High Court challenge to allow the media to report comments made under parliamentary privilege, the opposition Fianna Fáil party has said.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Denis O'Brien has used a High Court injunction to prevent the Irish media covering details of his personal finances mentioned in parliament.
The purchase of one of his companies was discussed last Thursday.
However, an injunction was deemed to outweigh parliamentary privilege.
This is the principle that politicians have the right to say anything in parliament and they can never be sued for libel for doing so.
The principle also means the public and media have a right to report what is said there.
The Republic of Ireland's national broadcaster RTÉ and other media outlets will make an application to the High Court this week seeking permission to broadcast statements made last Thursday in the Dáil [Irish parliament] by left-wing independent politician Catherine Murphy.
Fianna Fáil has called for legal counsel for the Irish parliament to join in this action to reassert constitutional protection for the privilege principle.
Government minister Paschal Donohoe of Fine Gael has said it is unacceptable that Irish media outlets cannot fully report her comments while foreign ones can.
Mr O'Brien is the Republic of Ireland's richest man.
With a fortune estimated to be around £5bn, Mr O'Brien has extensive media and telecommunication interests around the world and is the biggest shareholder in Independent News and Media, the company that owns the Belfast Telegraph.
Mr O'Brien has an injunction stopping RTÉ and other media outlets from reporting on certain details of his personal finances and his relationship with the former Anglo Irish bank.
The subsidiary of Siteserv, one of the companies he owns, is currently involved in installing the controversial meters for the highly unpopular water charges in the Republic of Ireland.
Miss Murphy, a left-wing independent politician, has obtained details through freedom of information requests about the sale of the company to Mr O'Brien by the nationalised former Anglo Irish Bank, now the Irish Bank Resolution Corporation or IBRC.
In that deal, £75m (105m euros) of taxpayers' money was written-off.
Miss Murphy said in the Dáil that there was a significant public interest in Mr O'Brien's finances.
She added that there are large outstanding sums and that the interest rate he was paying should arguably be much higher.
The Irish media have not been able to report the detail of what Miss Murphy said because the Dáil's privilege is outweighed by the High Court injunction.
The full details of what she said are available on the Dáil website and in the media beyond the island of Ireland.
Because of the injunction, the BBC can only report that Mr O'Brien was a major debtor to the former Anglo Irish bank, and that when his loans had expired he sought the same terms from the bank that had allowed him to pay off his own loans in his own time at low interest rates.
Mr O'Brien is a noted philanthropist with an interest in human rights and was involved in bringing the Special Olympics to Ireland in 2003.
But his critics describe him as a tax exile.
They point out that the Moriarty tribunal into suspected corruption found that, in the 1990s, Mr O'Brien received assistance from the then Fine Gael communications minister Michael Lowry in securing a mobile phone licence.
Mr Lowry received large sums from Mr O'Brien in complex financial transactions.
Both men have strongly denied any wrongdoing and no criminal charges were ever brought in relation to the findings.
