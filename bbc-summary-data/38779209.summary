Rangers 1-1 Ross County

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Rangers slipped to third in the Scottish Premiership after drawing with Ross County for a third time this season.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Alex Schalk clipped home from Jim O'Brien's pass to give the Highlanders a first-half lead.
Joe Garner and Philippe Senderos - both returning for Rangers - came close to levelling in the second period.
But Ibrox captain Lee Wallace did find the net after playing a neat one-two with Jon Toral.
Toral later fired into the side netting after substitute Martyn Waghorn had a shot blocked on what proved to be a frustrating day for Rangers.
Despite drawing level, Mark Warburton's side are now behind Aberdeen on goal difference and the Dons, who beat Partick Thistle, have a game in hand.
Having lost 4-1 away to Hearts on Wednesday, Warburton changed his defence, midfield and attack with the inclusions of Senderos, Jason Holt and Garner as defender Rob Kiernan was left out of the squad and Andy Halliday and Waghorn dropped to the bench.
But the alterations did not have the desired effect for the hosts as they found themselves losing the first goal for the third time in four matches, Schalk converting O'Brien's low delivery.
County - who drew 0-0 on the club's first visit to Ibrox in September - had earlier threatened through Liam Boyce.
And a mix-up between goalkeeper Wes Foderingham and defender Clint Hill allowed Schalk in again but he hit the side netting.
A couple of efforts from Barrie McKay and some dangerous balls into the box failed to really trouble Jim McIntyre's side.
Rangers did get closer after the break as Kenny Miller nodded wide, Garner drew saves from Scott Fox and Senderos headed over.
Wallace's second goal of the season after the exchange with on-loan Arsenal midfielder Toral restored the home crowd's hopes that their side could get a victory.
But Fox blocked a deflected James Tavernier cross and Toral could not convert after following in on the rebound of Waghorn's unsuccessful effort, the forward having come on for Garner.
The Ibrox side face Greenock Morton in the Scottish Cup next Sunday, with County playing Aberdeen in the cup the day before, and both sides return to league duty the following weekend.
Rangers manager Warburton: "We had chances from both flanks, cut backs to near post and far post, countless free-kicks with three or four over the bar. Now we have to look at that.
"The first 15 minutes was good. It was a very poor goal to give away and the result of that was for 15 minutes we were poor and gave them a couple of sniffs.
"We finished the half strongly but at half-time we were 1-0 down at Ibrox and we had to have a reaction to it, and we did."
[On the boos at full-time]: "They expect Rangers to win at home. I thought the support were generally good in the second half. I don't think they can accuse the players of not giving everything in the second half, it was wave after wave going forward."
Ross County boss Jim McIntyre: "I was very pleased obviously, coming off the back of two sore results against teams round about us.
"It's never easy coming here. I thought we started on the front foot, put Rangers under pressure and got the crowd a bit nervous.
"We scored a good goal and the only criticism is we should've taken another couple of the chances we created.
"Alex had two great chances but just didn't sort his feet out quick enough, but it was great play to get into that position.
"In the second half we knew we were going to have to weather the storm. We knew they were going to come at us and we had our goalkeeper, Scott Fox, to thank for some good saves at times and we've defended quite well at times as well."
