Former Leeds Rhinos and Great Britain forward Adrian Morley has rejoined the Super League club as academy coach.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Morley started his career with Rhinos, playing 149 games at second-row and prop, before joining NRL side Sydney Roosters in 2000.
The 39-year-old retired in 2015 after spells with Bradford, Warrington and hometown club Salford Red Devils.
"I have very fond memories of the club and the city; it is great to be a Rhino again," Morley said.
"The role will allow me to work with the first-team lads too and I am keen to help wherever [head coach Brian McDermott] sees fit.
"Learning from Brian and his staff will be invaluable to me and fantastic for my education as a coach as I set out on the coaching ladder; there are few better people around to learn from."
