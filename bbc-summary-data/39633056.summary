Daniel Beaumont of Springfield, Ipsden, Oxfordshire, admitted causing death by dangerous driving and driving whilst over the alcohol limit.
Beaumont crashed into Michael Dix, 27, from Reading, on the A4074 near Ipsden, in November, Oxford Crown Court heard.
Police said Beaumont's driving "could easily have caused greater loss of life that night".
Beaumont had passengers in his car at the time. The crash also involved a lorry.
He was disqualified from driving for five years and must take an extended driving test at the end of that period.
PC Julia Stroud said: "Daniel Beaumont got into his vehicle while drunk and drove, regardless of the safety of other drivers or his own passengers.
"He could easily have caused greater loss of life that night.
"Our thoughts are with the family and friends of Michael Dix at this time."
Tributes were paid to Mr Dix weeks after he died.
A family statement said: "Mike was a devoted and loving husband to Steph, doting father to their beautiful son Tommy aged three, and a loving son and brother.
"The love we all have for you will always remain in our hearts."
