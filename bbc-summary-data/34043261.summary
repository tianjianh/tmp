The world breaststroke champion and world record holder tells Get Inspired how, as a small child, he would try and climb out of the bath his fear of the water was so bad.

"I started my first swimming lesson and absolutely loved it," he says. "My swimming teacher made it into a fun kind of thing and it was through that I learned to love it."
