Rangers: Martyn Waghorn relishing Pedro Caixinha's 'better' style of football

Martyn Waghorn says Rangers' style of play has improved since Pedro Caixinha replaced Mark Warburton as manager.

Rangers have won two and drawn two of Caixinha's four games in charge, including an impressive 3-0 win over Aberdeen at Pittdorie last weekend.
The Portuguese has put an emphasis on a more aggressive approach in the attacking third.
"It's a better, quicker, direct style of play which all the forward boys are going to enjoy," Waghorn said.
"I think at times we did try and overplay (under Warburton). The manager wants us, when we play through lines to stay through lines, and attack the box as quickly as we can.
"As a striker it is nice to know we are going to be getting the ball in the box and get chances."
After a blistering start to the season during which he scored five goals in four games, Waghorn's hot streak was halted after he was sidelined with a hamstring problem.
He admits he struggled to rediscover his best form on his return to action, but feels he can find his scoring touch again under Caixinha.
"I was disappointed with how I performed in the first half of the season," the former Wigan striker explained.

"I think I could have done a lot better when I got my chance. For one reason or other I didn't take it.
"But that's in the past now. I am pleased that I am playing, getting a run of games, and hopefully I can stay in the side for the new manager."
Waghorn says the whole squad has been given a lift by Caixinha's arrival and the players are responding to the new manager's methods.
"It's been challenging in different ways but the boys have bought into it very well," the 27-year-old added.
"The training methods, the style, how he wants to approach games, the analysis of other teams, has been different to what we are used to, but I've loved every minute of it.
"I have enjoyed the hard work and I think it has shown at the weekend how we defend as a team now as well as attacking as a team.
"We have changed a lot, little things that we have worked on the training pitch, but it's for the right reasons and hopefully it's good for a change going forward."
