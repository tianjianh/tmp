Firearms teams were called to the address in Oxbarn Avenue after receiving information Dylan Jackson might be inside.
However, the property was later found to be empty, West Midlands Police said.
Mr Jackson, 19, is wanted over the killing of 47-year-old Herman Simpson, also known as Louis, on Monday.
Mr Simpson died after being stabbed in the back at around 20:30 BST at a bedsit in the city's Compton Road.
Supt Ron Winch said Jackson was still being sought and advised people not to approach him, but to immediately call police.
He said officers were tipped off about the house after the force received a call "made in good faith".
Mr Winch also said the decision to send in armed police had been taken to "ensure public safety and because of the serious nature of the crime".
"With this in mind we ensured we had an appropriate number of officers on hand to deal with any situation which presented itself," he said.
Three people arrested in connection with the stabbing have been released without charge and are now being treated as witnesses.
