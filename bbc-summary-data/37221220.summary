Emmanuel Macron: France's ambitious man 'on the move'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Emmanuel Macron is young, ambitious and popular and now a centrist candidate in the crowded race for the French presidency.

As the name of his movement, En Marche, suggests, he is very much a man "on the move".
But, aged 38, he has already upset the Socialist left he has represented in government as well as the conservative right.
Republican frontrunner Alain Juppe accused him of stabbing the Socialist president in the back. That is because he is feared by the right as well as the left, where his political career began.
"My aim isn't to bring together the right or the left but to bring together the French people," said Mr Macron as he announced his presidential bid.
A former investment banker, Emmanuel Macron worked as economic adviser to President Francois Hollande before taking up the post of economy minister in 2014.
Little known initially, he soon forged a reputation with his "Macron Law", a controversial reform bill that allowed shops to open more often on Sundays and deregulated some sectors of industry.
The law was forced through by Prime Minister Manuel Valls despite large protests and opposition from left-wing party rebels. In an interview with the BBC's HARDtalk, he insisted his Socialist opponents were tiny in number.
For much of France's business community he became a breath of fresh air, with a list of pro-business policies aimed at boosting economic growth. He has championed digital start-ups and prompted a long-distance bus market.
Born in Amiens, Mr Macron was educated at the prestigious Henri-IV public secondary school in Paris, an institution widely regarded as one of the most demanding sixth-form colleges in France.
He graduated from the elite ENA college, then studied philosophy before moving into finance at Rothschild & Cie bank in 2008.
He first met Francois Hollande in 2006 and although he was courted by the centre-right, he felt more at home with the Socialists. He has never been elected an MP.
He raised eyebrows in 2007 when he married his former French teacher Brigitte Trogneux, 20 years his senior.
She was quoted by Paris Match magazine as saying: "At the age of 17, Emmanuel said to me, 'Whatever you do, I will marry you!'"
For years a protege of President Hollande, his position in government became increasingly awkward in April 2016 when he set up En Marche.
His loyalty to the prime minister was then questioned following the first rally of his political movement and he was threatened with the sack by President Hollande. "If you don't respect the rules, you're out," the president said.
At a protest in June held by the General Confederation of Labour (CGT) union, Mr Macron was told to "get lost" and pelted with eggs after telling a union member "the best way to afford a suit is to work".
By August, he had resigned, to focus on "a new step in my battle and to build a project... that isn't compatible with being in government".  There was little secret he was focusing on a presidential bid.
His En Marche movement now counts almost 97,000 people as followers and he has been busy planning his policies.
At the heart of his ideas are plans to end France's 35-hour week for younger workers. "When you're young, 35 hours isn't enough. You want to work more and learn your job," he told Le Nouvel Observateur.
As for workers in their 50s, he argues they should have the choice of a shorter working week.
Announcing his candidacy he said he rejected a paralysed system that had stopped protecting those it sought to protect.
His ideas have been derided by the French left, who see him as a "copy-and-paste Tony Blair". Nevertheless he does identify himself as a man of the left, but "of a left that deals with reality and wants to reform the country".
Although Emmanuel Macron polls consistently well nationally, with around 15%-18% of voters, he is unpopular with politicians on the left and the right.
"Macron doesn't really resonate in society. They talk about him at Paris dinner parties, but not in the markets," one government official told Le Monde.
And his candidacy will also annoy the centre-right Republicans, who are putting seven candidates up before voters in national primaries on Sunday.
