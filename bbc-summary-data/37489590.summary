Wasps comprehensively beat Harlequins to return to the top of the Premiership and maintain their 100% record.

Wasps secured a bonus point within 32 minutes as Ashley Johnson, Guy Thompson, Dan Robson and Elliot Daly crossed for the hosts.
Jamie Roberts and James Chisholm's tries kept Quins in touch at half-time.
But three more tries in the second half from Christian Wade, Kyle Eastmond and Josh Bassett extinguished any hopes of a shock away win for Harlequins.
Wasps' seven tries came from seven different scorers on an afternoon where centre Jimmy Gopperth missed one conversion off the tee.
But, as clinical as Dai Young's side were when handed opportunities in the first half, it was Harlequins who enjoyed the bulk of possession and territory.
They deservedly hauled themselves back into contention at 26-18 by half-time courtesy of Wales centre Roberts and number eight Chisholm's tries.
However, John Kingston's men were unable to build on the momentum of beating defending champions Saracens 17-10 last weekend and could not add further points after the break.
Once winger Tim Visser had a try ruled out for stepping out of touch, their chances evaporated. Wasps turned on the style with winger Bassett's second try in as many weeks rounding off the scoring.
Wasps director of rugby Dai Young:
"We were ruthless without a shadow of doubt. We had four visits to their 22 in the first half and scored four tries.
"That's something we've talked about constantly, and which has been a drum I've been banging since I've been here and it's perhaps taken a while to sink in.
"But you couldn't fault us today, as when we had opportunities we took them.
"I thought we showed some real attacking intent and scored some great tries, and the real exciting factor for me is that there is still a lot more to come from us."
Harlequins director of rugby John Kingston:
"We had 70% in their half and 61% possession of the ball, so that tells one part of the story, but on the other side seven tries to two says we didn't take our chances.
"We weren't good enough when they had the ball and made it much too easy for them to score points, so we've got to be honest, look at it and see why those things are happening.
"Conceding 47 points in a game clearly suggests the defending is not good enough because you're not going to win, are you?
"I'm not being rude, but it's not rocket science, and conceding seven tries and 47 points is unacceptable."
