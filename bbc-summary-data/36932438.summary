The mother of a man who was murdered in a row over a drug debt seven years ago has appealed for help to find his body.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Jesse Richards, originally from Gloucester, died at Cleeve Prior in Evesham, Worcestershire, on 31 July 2009.
Five men were jailed in 2012 over the death of the 40-year-old father-of-three, who lived in Surrey, but his body was never recovered.
West Mercia Police said they believe his remains were taken to Warwickshire.
A Â£10,000 reward is on offer for anyone with information that leads to the recovery of the body.
Lucy Richards said she hoped someone would come forward and help find her son.
"If they could for one minute put themselves in my place they would know the heartache I am feeling and have felt for the last seven years," she said.
Supt Mark Loader, from West Midlands Police, urged people to "consider the pain" the Richards family endures.
He said: "His killers have been brought to justice for their crimes.  However, his family continue to suffer and we want to give them the opportunity to lay Jesse to rest."
