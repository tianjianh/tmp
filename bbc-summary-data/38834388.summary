Campaigners want to turn the building, in Clifton, Bristol, into a one-stop shop for a host of everyday items.
The Friends of Clifton Centre and Library (FOCCAL) told the Bristol Post the project would benefit people with limited space at home.
They hope turning the service into a "library of things" will protect it from future cost-cutting measures.
Clifton library - which recently had its hours cut - also hosts craft sessions and relaxation classes.
Councillor Paula O'Rourke said people had told her they wanted to keep the library open but they realised it had to move with the times.
"In the 1930s libraries used to lend out pictures so people that couldn't afford them could put them up on their walls," the Green councillor for Clifton said.
"Then they started loaning books, videos, CDs and DVDs so now we thought in the future we could look at a library of things.
"People don't always have the space for garden tools, power washers, hammers or travel cots in small flats," she added.
Ms O'Rourke said she also hoped people would volunteer to help run writing workshops, craft classes or just organise board game sessions for the elderly or lonely with cheap tea and coffee for sale.
FOCCAL was set up in response to previous plans to shut seven of the city's libraries in an attempt to save Â£1.1m.
But after public consultation the plans were revisited and a compromise reached with reduced opening hours.
