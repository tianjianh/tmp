Cerys Yemm, 22, was attacked by Matthew Williams at the Sirhowy Arms Hotel in Argoed on 6 November 2014.
Police officers stunned Williams, 34, with a Taser but he later died.
An inquest jury ruled Miss Yemm was unlawfully killed, while Williams died as a result of taking drugs and struggling against police restraint.
Cerys' sister Shannon Yemm told BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme: "I had people messaging me. I'd already seen in a [Facebook] post there'd been a murder in Argoed.
"And then I had people messaging me via Facebook message saying 'please don't tell me it's true, it's not your sister is it?'.
"Mum was obviously crying and couldn't tell me, couldn't speak on the phone."
She then had to make the drive from Cardiff to Argoed without knowing what had happened to her sister.
Cerys' mother Paula Yemm said she first learned the death was being described a "cannibal killing" when she saw the news headlines on TV.
She said: "I woke up at four or five in the morning, walked into the living room and just saw Cerys' picture and those headlines.
"You can't describe as a parentâ€¦ seeing those headlines about your child. I still can't comprehend that today."
The hostel owner Mandy Miles had told the 999 operator at the time of the attack that she believed Williams was cannibalising Miss Yemm.
But a Home Office pathologist later told the inquest into her death there was no evidence to support that claim.
"For the last two and a half years that's been over us as a family, not knowing the circumstances, just very much in the dark about my childâ€¦ and what they went through", Mrs Yemm added.
Gwent Police said the circumstances of the death were given to Paula Yemm in a "sensitive way" after the family requested that limited information was given to them regarding her injuries.
