Up Helly Aa fire festival held in Lerwick

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The spectacular annual Up Helly Aa Viking fire festival has been held in Shetland.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Hundred of torch bearers have paraded through the streets of Lerwick, before burning a replica Viking galley.
This year's Guizer Jarl - festival leader - is joiner Lyall Gair, who headed the parade.
It is the biggest procession of its kind in Europe and celebrates the islands' Viking heritage.
Hundreds of visitors from around the world arrive in the islands for the event.
The festival is a descendant of the ancient feast of Yule - which the Vikings held to celebrate the rebirth of the sun.
