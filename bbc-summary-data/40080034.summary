Page will be in charge of Wales Under-20s at the Toulon Tournament, which begins against hosts France on Tuesday, 30 May.
"There's a pathway for them if they want to take it," Page said.
"If they're committed to the cause and committed to playing for their country there's an opportunity to play for the first team."
Page added: "The message I've said to them is when they cross that white line to give everything they've got, because there's a definite pathway through to the first team.
"You've only got to look at the lads in the squad to go to Portugal."
Liverpool pair Harry Wilson, 20, and 17-year-old Ben Woodburn are in Wales' senior squad for a training camp in Portugal ahead of June's World Cup qualifier in Serbia.

Exeter City's 16-year-old midfielder Ethan Ampadu will also travel to Portugal while manager Chris Coleman has called up Everton's 21-year-old defender Gethin Jones for the first time.
Wales have been invited to take part in the Toulon Tournament for the first time, following the exploits of the senior side in reaching the Euro 2016 semi-finals.
Former Port Vale and Northampton Town boss Page will be in charge for the first time since succeeding Geraint Williams in March.
"I'd heard good things about this group coming through," said Page, a former defender who won 41 caps for Wales.
"I'm really impressed with what I've seen so far - their attitude and application has been exceptional.
"But the proof will be in the pudding now. There's a great tournament for us in the Toulon trip.
"We're looking forward to the challenges that lie ahead."
Page's side will also face Bahrain and the Ivory Coast in Group B in the south of France.
