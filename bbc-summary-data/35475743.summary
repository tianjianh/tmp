The performance will be overseen by Chic's Nile Rodgers, who produced Bowie's hit album Let's Dance in 1983.
"The tribute will be a multisensory testament to the icon's incredible artistry and a reflection of his limitless creativity," said the Recording Academy in a statement.
Gaga has previously credited Bowie as an inspiration.
"He's sort of like an alien prince," she once told chat show host Alan Carr. "Every morning I wake up and I think, 'What would Bowie do?'"
"We had already booked Lady Gaga on this year's show, but when David passed - almost in a single moment - we knew we had to change direction," said Ken Ehrlich, executive producer of the Grammys.
"We immediately spoke and agreed that she should be the one to honour David. She's perfect for it."
The Grammys will be held in Los Angeles on 15 February. Gaga is nominated for best song written for visual media, thanks to her Diane Warren-penned ballad Til It Happens To You, from the documentary The Hunting Ground.
Other performers on the night include Adele, Kendrick Lamar, James Bay, Ellie Goulding and Carrie Underwood.
During his career, Bowie was nominated for 11 Grammys but only won once - when Jazzin' for Blue Jean was awarded best video in 1985. He also received a lifetime achievement prize in 2006.
The star died of cancer on 10 January, just days after releasing his new album, Blackstar. It will be eligible for honours at next year's Grammy ceremony.
A Bowie tribute is also planned for the Brit Awards, which take place on 24 February. Details have yet to be announced, but media reports suggest that Noel Gallagher, Bono, Adele and Damon Albarn have been invited to take part.
