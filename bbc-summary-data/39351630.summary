Colchester United midfielder Sammie Szmodics says he is "unlikely to feature again" this season after breaking his leg at Crewe.

Szmodics told BBC Essex he was in "excruciating" pain before being stretchered off in their 2-0 defeat.
Saturday's result left the â€ŽU's 11th in League Two, four points outside of the play-off places.
The 21-year-old had only just returned to the side after a four month lay-off caused by a broken ankle.
He had scored two goals in four games, but suffered the injury 14 minutes into the match against Crewe.
"If I'm being realistic it probably is my season. But I really, really don't want to rule it out," he said.
"Coming back from the ankle injury I felt I'd never played a football game with so much confidence. I wanted to show everyone what they had been missing."
Szmodics, who has played 62 times for Colchester after coming through the youth ranks at the club, will not need need surgery on his fibula, but said he faces six to eight weeks of recovery in the gym.
He added: "It was more of a shock than anything else as it wasn't a bad challenge. It wasn't a foul.
"As soon as I went down the pain was excruciating. I couldn't put my foot down.
"I can only believe these things are happening for a reason. These last two seasons have been a write-off for me."
