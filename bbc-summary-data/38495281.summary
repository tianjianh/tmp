Francis O'Sullivan, 52, suffered a serious head injury at the annual Sutton Valence pram race, near Maidstone, on New Year's Day.
He was taken by air ambulance to a London hospital and died in the early hours of Tuesday.
His sister, Jeanette O'Sullivan, wrote on Facebook: "My beautiful brother tragic accident... Love you always and forever in our thoughts."
She continued: "A great Brother Dad and Uncle. May you sleep tight and smile down on us. Sweet dreams. Love you for ever your family xx."
Mr O'Sullivan, who was known as Titch, was one of three men wearing RAF costumes who had entered the race in a pram decorated as a Spitfire.
Kent Police said officers had carried out inquiries into the incident and there were no suspicious circumstances.
Thousands of people turned out to watch the annual event, which raises money for charity and involves people running around in homemade prams.
It was organised by the local Queen's Head pub's Oddfellows Fund.
