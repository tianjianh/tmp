Brazil media reaction to impeachment vote highlights political divide

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The response of Brazilian media to the vote for impeachment proceedings to go ahead against President Dilma Rousseff illustrates the political divide in the country, with many outlets adopting a stance along left-right lines.

The front pages of print and online media are dominated by the result of the vote, in which the "yes" camp comfortably won the two-thirds majority required to send the proceedings to the next stage.
The majority of Brazil's established mass-circulation newspapers are traditionally conservative, and view the vote as a massive defeat for the embattled president.
The front page of the printed edition of the right-leaning paper O Globo carries a photo of MPs celebrating the outcome accompanied by the headline "Close to the End".
The website of another right-of-centre paper, Folha de Sao Paulo, features one of the first images to emerge after the announcement of the result - a photo of a smiling Vice-President Michel Temer.
His party was until recently in a coalition with Ms Rousseff's Workers' Party but recently left the coalition in order to support the impeachment.
He is also the person who will take over as interim president if Ms Rousseff is impeached.
But a popular blog written by Ricardo Noblat for O Globo warns that Mr Temer has "no room for error".
Mr Noblat points out that Ms Rousseff and Mr Temer differ in everything from temperament to priorities.
He argues that if Mr Temer ends up stepping in for Ms Rousseff he will be thrown in at the deep end with very little time to put his mark on the presidency.
Some left-wing media outlets stress that the impeachment process is not yet over.
The online magazine Revista Forum carries a piece headlined "Dilma's impeachment still needs to go through the Senate", which points out that Ms Rousseff's defeat in the lower house is not quite the final nail in her political coffin.
Another online centre-left magazine, Carta Capital, features an interview with senior Workers' Party official and MP Paulo Pimenta.
In the interview, Mr Pimenta labels those who voted for impeachment as "racists, homophobes, the gun squad and landowners".
Even some centre-right media outlets, such as Estado de Sao Paulo, note wryly that many MPs who voted in favour of impeachment are themselves being investigated for corruption.
Several MPs come under criticism for the speeches they made when casting their votes.
Revista Forum features an article on MP Jair Bolsonaro, who dedicated his vote to "the memory of Colonel Carlos Alberto Brilhante Ustra" - who was found guilty of torture and kidnapping during the 1964-1985 military dictatorship.
Many papers also highlight the reactions of anti- and pro-impeachment protestors who took to the streets on Sunday.
Centre-right daily Correio Braziliense features a photo of Ms Rousseff's supporters crying, juxtaposing it with a photo of pro-impeachment protestors celebrating.
Twitter has been inundated with opinion since the start of the proceedings on Friday, and several hashtags have emerged which represent both sides of the spectrum.
Those in support of impeachment are posting tweets under the hashtage #TchauQuerida (#ByeDarling), in an ironic reference to a tapped phone conversation between President Rousseff and former President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva.
On the other side, #RespeiteAsUrnas (#RespectTheBallots) refers to the 54 million people who elected President Rousseff and was popular among opponents of the impeachment during Sunday's vote.
