Jakubiak has only made one first-team appearance so far for the Hornets, in a 4-1 Championship defeat by Huddersfield Town in May 2014.
The 20-year-old has been out on loan on four previous occasions, most recently at Fleetwood earlier this season, scoring one goal in five games.
"He's got a good eye for goal," Wycombe boss Gareth Ainsworth said.
"We have good competition for places up front but games are coming thick and fast and keeping everyone fit and sharp is a big challenge for us."
