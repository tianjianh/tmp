Jack Mansfield died peacefully in his sleep in Etwall in Derbyshire on Sunday, his family said.
The widower was a "strong-willed" man who lived on his own until earlier this year, when he went into a care home.
He leaves behind six children, 10 grandchildren, 15 great-grandchildren and one great-great grandchild.
His youngest son Richard, 70,  said his father attributed his longevity to hard work and using vinegar.
"He had a bottle by the bed until the day he died. He would rub it on his knee and drink a little bit from time to time.
"He swore by vinegar."
Born John Mansfield on 14 December 1907, he was an agricultural worker and coal-delivery man for much of his life.
He lived alone at his home, a former council house in Mayfield, until September when medical complaints saw him move to a care home in Etwall.
"He lived on his own until earlier this year when he was 108. He'd get up and get himself dressed and someone would drop over during the day to see how he was doing," his son Richard said.
Mr Mansfield and his late wife Beatrice had six children - the eldest an 83-year-old daughter Doreen.
"He hated being inside and wanted to keep working as long as he could," his son said.
"He's like a caged animal (when he's indoors) because he loves outdoors," Doreen added.
"His most popular saying was: 'I can do it myself!'"
When he got his first congratulatory card from the Queen, Mr Mansfield's first comment was: "Who's told her?", his family said.
His funeral is planned for 10 December in Mayfield near Ashbourne, where he lived most of his life.
Mourners are being asked to wear red as the centenarian was a fan of Manchester United.
