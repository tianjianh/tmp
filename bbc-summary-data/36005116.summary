Five men suspected of being illegal immigrants have still not been found, police have said.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The stowaways were part of a group seen leaving a lorry by the side of the A168, near Boroughbridge, on Thursday.
The driver, a Lithuanian national, 49, arrested on suspicion of an immigration offence has been released on bail.
Three other men, aged 20, 24 and 29, arrested on suspicion of entering the UK illegally have been handed over to the immigration service.
The three men are all believed to be Kurdish.
Three women and five children seen leaving the lorry with the group are in the care of the local authority.
North Yorkshire Police said extensive searches by specialist search teams and sniffer dogs had failed to locate the five remaining men.
The force urged the public to report any potential sighting of the men, particularly in the Boroughbridge area.
Officers also asked people to check their sheds and outbuildings for signs the men may have been sheltering in them.
