[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The West Indian Carnival in Leeds, which was launched in 1967, will be held in Potternewton Park over the August bank holiday weekend.
An exhibition recording its heritage, political and cultural legacy is planned for the city's Tetley gallery.
The event, which attracts more than 100,000 people, will culminate in a parade through Chapeltown and Harehills.
A 50-strong carnival choir and a week of new plays at the West Yorkshire Playhouse will help mark the anniversary.
Talking about the inspiration for the celebrations, founder Arthur France, said: "We needed something to bring us together and where you don't need an invite, so you just come."
