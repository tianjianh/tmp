[SN]TITLE[SN]
Treviso 21-6 Edinburgh

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Treviso consigned Edinburgh to a record eighth successive Pro12 defeat, and ninth in all tournaments, as Duncan Hodge's side fell to a 15-point loss.

Robert Barbieri and Angelo Esposito scored tries either side of half-time for the hosts, who climb off the bottom and leapfrog Italian rivals Zebre.
Treviso's Ian McKinley kicked 11 points, with two Jason Tovey penalties Edinburgh's only scores.
The Scottish side have not won in the league since 31 December.
And acting head coach Hodge's poor Pro12 record since taking interim charge of Edinburgh in September continues with just three victories from 16 matches.
The opening quarter at Stadio Monigo was grim and scrappy, but the visitors were first to mount a serious raid on their opponents' 22 when Damien Hoyland slalomed his way through midfield.
The break yielded the game's first points, Tovey slotting from the tee, but McKinley replied almost immediately for Treviso, and nudged his side ahead with a second penalty after 32 minutes.
With five first-half minutes remaining, a searing burst and hack ahead from centre Tommaso Iannone left Hamish Watson scrambling to dot down behind his own line.
The Italian pack pulverised their counterparts from the resultant five-metre scrummage, earning a penalty and calling for a second set-piece.
A repeat of the previous drive splintered the Edinburgh forwards, and left number eight Barbieri with a simple finish, McKinley converting.
The Irishman, who lost the sight in one eye during a game in 2010, added a third penalty a minute after the interval.
And though that goal preceded a period of significant Edinburgh pressure, the visitors would leave Treviso territory with just three more points, via the boot of Tovey, to show for their toil.
The Italians showed no such profligacy when lock Dean Budd galloped away from Simon Berghan and off-loaded brilliantly for Edoardo Gori to skip into the away 22.
Gori exchanged passes with Barbieri, and found winger Luca Sperandino metres from the line - his floated pass was weighted neatly for Esposito to run home untouched.
McKinley missed the conversion, Sperandino butchered what should have been a third Treviso try when he failed to ground a bobbling grubber-kick in the Edinburgh in-goal area, and Tito Tebaldi was denied a last-gasp counter-attack score by a forward pass.
Not one of those missed opportunities mattered, however, since the Scots never looked likely to overhaul the deficit.
