Bede's World - dedicated to the saint and scholar - shut in February, with trustees blaming government cuts.
The museum, which employed 27 people, will now be run by charity Groundwork South Tyneside and Newcastle.
It said it would reopen in October as Jarrow Hall - Anglo Saxon Farm, Village and Bede Museum.
Andrew Watts, the charity's executive director, said: "This is a new dawn for this well-known, well-loved and highly important history centre.
"It is essential that its celebration of the life of the Venerable Bede, through the museum and other educational services, remains a key element of its work, but recent history has shown that it must have broader appeal.
"The site has many amazing features and attractions which will be reflected in a new calendar of activities and events.
"This will include special themed events, an educational programme for schools, heritage skills workshops, space for businesses and events space."
A spokesman for South Tyneside Council, which owns the the land and buildings, said: "We believe we have found a solution to ensure this venue has a long-term future for the people of South Tyneside and the wider region."
Bede lived from 672 AD to 735 AD and is considered the father of English history.
He lived in the twin monasteries of Wearmouth and Jarrow, where he wrote and translated dozens of books on theology, history, nature, astronomy and poetry.
His most famous work remains The Ecclesiastical History of the English People, which was the first work of history to use the AD system of dating.
