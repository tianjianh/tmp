[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An independent review into the Isle of Man's hospital is "a sign of a healthy, self-critical organisation, not failure", says the health minister.

In Tynwald, David Anderson confirmed plans are in place for an external assessment, the timings of which are due to be announced next month.
It follows the publication of a series of concerns from senior consultants about standards at Noble's hospital.
Mr Anderson said plans for a review have been in the pipeline since 2008.
He added the delay had been due to trying to persuade UK regulators, Care Quality Commission (CQC), to take on additional work outside the UK.
The CQC was set up in the UK as a way of checking that hospitals, care homes and care services meet national standards.
Talks are now ongoing with other health service regulators.  The inspection dates will be announced in the July sitting of Tynwald.
