Russian doping: Rowing's world governing body to review testing of Russians

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Rowing's world governing body has begun a complete review of the drug-testing of Russian rowers since 2011.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Fisa acted after an independent report claimed Russia operated a state-sponsored doping programme for four years across the "vast majority" of summer and winter Olympic sports.
The World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada) has called for Russia to be banned from next month's Rio Olympics.
The International Olympic Committee has yet to decide the team's fate.
Russia's men's quadruple sculls team have been disqualified from the Games after one member - Sergey Fedorovtsev - tested positive for a banned substance.
The country's track and field athletes are also barred from competing as a result of doping violations though the Court of Arbitration for Sport is due to rule on Thursday on an appeal from the All-Russia Athletic Federation (Araf).
Five Russian rowing crews are due to compete at this summer's Olympics, with two taking part in the Paralympic Games.
The executive committee of Fisa has also asked Wada to supply the evidence relating to rowing and rowers that was presented in the McLaren report.
