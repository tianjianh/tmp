Work has begun on a new £10.5m whisky distillery in the centre of Glasgow.

The distillery will sit on the banks of the River Clyde at a former pump house between the Riverside Museum and the SSE Hydro Arena.
The multi-million pound development will have a visitor centre, cafe and gift shop.
The team behind the new Clydeside distillery said it hoped work would be completed and spirits would be "flowing" by the end of next year.
Owned by Morrison Glasgow Distillers, the distillery will offer guided tours, whisky tastings and an interactive whisky experience.
It is expected to attract 65,000 visitors per year and create up to 25 jobs when it opens next autumn.
The firm's chairman, Tim Morrison, owner of AD Rattray Scotch Whisky Company, said the firm's vision to build a distillery on the banks of the Clyde was "now set to become a reality."
"Work has started on site and our first batch of spirit should be flowing before the end of next year," he said.
"The city was once home to many whisky distilleries and we think the Clydeside Distillery will put Glasgow right back on the Scotch whisky map."
