County Championship: Miguel Cummins takes seven wickets against Sussex at Hove

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Worcestershire's West Indies fast bowler Miguel Cummins took 7-84, while Australian Steve Magoffin weighed in with a second 'five-for' of the match as 17 wickets fell in the day at Hove.

Resuming on 50-4, Sussex slumped to 71-7 before a 97-run stand between Chris Jordan (57*) and Jofra Archer (46) helped avoid the follow-on on 229.
Having trailed by 77, Sussex then bowled out Worcestershire for 194.
Set 272 to win, Sussex closed on 13-1 for the loss of Chris Nash.
He was caught behind in the final over off Joe Leach by Ben Cox, who had earlier scored his second half century of the match to follow Tom Fell's 85 and 31 from Joe Clarke - the only three Worcestershire batsmen in double figures.
Magoffin's match figures of 10-70, having followed his first-innings 5-38 with an even tidier 5-32, has given Sussex hope, aided by David Wiese (4-18). but Worcestershire look in better shape to win and improve their chances of taking the runners-up spot off Kent in Division Two behind promoted Essex.
Cummins' earlier haul, in only his second appearance for Worcestershire, was not as economical as his career-best 7-45 for Barbados against Trinidad & Tobago at Port of Spain in April 2013 - but it was a big improvement on his wicketless debut against Essex at Chelmsford last week.
Sussex coach Mark Davis told BBC Radio Sussex:
"It was another exciting day and a lot happened but our bowlers kept us in the game. We did well from 71-7 to scrap to 229 and then Steve Magoffin bowled magnificently again on a pitch where you can score runs quite quickly.
"In the last few games he has been absolutely fantastic for us and he got great support from the other seamers, particularly David Wiese.
"Losing Chris Nash at the end was a blow but, as we showed in the first innings, we bat a long way down. It was great to see Chris Jordan and Jofra Archer batting so intelligently. Their partnership might turn out to be absolutely crucial.
Worcestershire assistant coach Matt Mason told BBC Herefordshire & Worcestershire:
"Our batsmen think Steve Magoffin is the best new-ball bowler in the division and he showed it again. He was magnificent for them.
"The first hour tomorrow is going to be crucial to deciding the outcome. If we can take two or three wickets then we'll be in a strong position but if Sussex come hard at us it will be us under a bit of pressure.
"Wickets have tended to fall in clusters but the way Tom Fell and Ben Cox, for the second time in the match, batted showed you can score runs. Their stand might make the difference."
