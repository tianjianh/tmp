[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Eamon Rory Owen McTaggart broke into the house at Tamneymore Park in October 2013.
He is currently serving a seven-year jail sentence in Maghaberry Prison for robbery, drugs and other burglary offences.
McTaggart has been disqualified for driving for five years and fined Â£350.
He gained access to the house by taking a spare set of keys and then stole his mothers car, while she was sleeping in bed.
It was found in a damaged condition at Rosemount Avenue by members of the police.
McTaggart was sitting in the driver seat and was three times the legal limit for alcohol.
A defence barrister said that the actions of McTaggart, who has 33 previous convictions, were reprehensible.
The barrister said McTaggart's prison release date was late 2018.
