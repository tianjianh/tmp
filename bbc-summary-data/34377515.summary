Shannon Conn, 13, was part of the Ireland team, along with sheep farmer John Maginn.
The teenager and her nine-year-old Collie dog, Bill, have been crowned Irish junior champions.
The event, that showcases the best junior and senior sheep dog handlers, was shown on BBC One's rural affairs show Countryfile on Sunday.
Shannon told BBC Radio Foyle that she enjoyed appearing on national television.
"My dad gave me Bill as a Christmas present and he had him trained for me as well.
"The dog is old enough now, so he knows what to do.
"Bill is just one of a kind and he just does everything."
Shannon's dad, Loughlin, said that he is extremely proud of her.
"It is a joint competition. Shannon was picked as the young handler to compete with John.
"The joint points went forward to put Ireland in the top spot. It is a great achievement."
