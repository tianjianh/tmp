Flying Irish: Wingsuit team hoping for World Cup glory

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
In the pantheon of Irish sporting success, you'll find boxers, golfers - even the odd footballer. But after next week we might find a couple of fallers in there too.

Fallers who drop from 4,000ft that is.
So here's to the Irish wingsuit team, a trio of thrill-seeking high-fliers whose recreation-of-choice makes other sports look small and inconsequential, largely because most other sports don't involve jumping out of a plane.
On Friday, the fearless threesome made their way to Netheravon, England, for the first ever Wingsuit Performance Flying World Cup.
The event starts on Monday, with around 70 competitors from around the world all vying for flying glory.
Naturally, this gathering would be incomplete without representation from Northern Ireland - step forward Marc Daly, from Caledon, County Armagh.
Along with Dublin brothers, Stephen and David Duffy, he makes up an Irish team who are wingsuited and booted for action.
The 45 year old started jumping out of planes in 2009, taking up skydiving as a hobby.
So what is it like to hurtle towards the ground in a wingsuit?
"That's the thing, we don't hurtle," he cheerfully corrected. "We fall relatively slowly, but fly quite fast through the air."
Indeed, unlike traditional skydiving, wingsuit fliers fall at slower speeds, typically 40 to 60 mph compared to double that for a skydiver.
But they blast through the air at 70 to 90 mph horizontally, thanks to their flying squirrel-style attire.
"It's a hard movement" Marc said. "The suit throws your arms and legs out, and it's quite stiff.
"That's why you can't start using a wingsuit until you've done 200 skydives, because you need to know what you're doing."
But the Armagh man would not have it any other way. Soon after becoming a qualified skydiver, Marc tried wingsuit flying for the first time and never looked back.
"I was hooked on skydiving as soon as I tried it. But I got bored with it. It must sound strange, but it became natural to jump out of a plane with a rig on my back.
"It's just a different thrill. I think since I started with the wingsuit, I've done 200 or 300 jumps, and only a couple have been skydiving.
"It's just an extra buzz.
"In some ways, the suit flies itself, so it's not too difficult. The hard part is making sure you get into the right body position and then are able to control it.
"But in competition, what we try to do is fly our suits to the absolute limit. See what the suits can do."
Marc and the Duffys have been competing in various wing suit competitions around the world since about 2011.
But next week's first ever World Cup is the pinnacle of the growing sport.
"Naturally the competitions are a lot more intense, there's a lot of preparation," said Marc.
"We've been doing well in events, we've brought a lot of medals back home.
"Ireland is a small nation compared to many, we're taking a team of three to the World Cup, but the likes of the US and UK will have 12-man teams.
"We wouldn't have 12 wingsuiters in the entire country."
The World Cup, taking place for five days from Monday, 25 May, is an individual competition, with each wingsuit flyer completing three jumps.
Each jump is separately measured for speed, time and distance.
As a less experienced flyer, Marc is in the intermediate category but is optimistic that the Irish team, and the Duffy brothers who have completed hundreds of wingsuit jumps, will find success.
"Those two boys [the Duffys] are super-talented wingsuiters. We're definitely hoping to get one of them in the top ten in the world.
"That would be a great achievement. But mostly we're hoping to promote the sport a bit more, so we can get more people involved."
