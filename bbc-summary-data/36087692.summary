County Championship: Sam Robson breaks records in Middlesex-Warwickshire draw

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Middlesex opener Sam Robson broke several long-standing county batting records at Lord's as his side's opening Championship match of the season ended in a dull draw against Warwickshire.

Robson added 106 to his first-innings double century to end up with a county-record haul of 337 runs in the match.
He was aided by skipper Adam Voges (92) and Nick Compton, who added 10 to his overnight score before exiting for 44.
Middlesex eventually reached 304-6 before hands were shaken at 16:50 BST.
Warwickshire's second successive away draw ended with an unlikely statistical quirk -a maiden first-class wicket for Bears wicketkeeper Tim Ambrose.

Brought on to herald the end of the game, the 33-year-old former England player had only ever bowled six balls before, during his time with Sussex.
But, with two balls left, in a late bid to reach his century, Voges skied Ambrose to the waiting Keith Barker at deep mid-wicket.
Middlesex have now not beaten Warwickshire in 20 meetings since June 2001. The Bears' away record is even better, having not lost in 17 trips to Middlesex since losing at Uxbridge in 1988.
The record for the most runs ever scored in a match at Lord's remains the 456 piled up against India in 1990 by then-England captain Graham Gooch, who is now Warwickshire's part-time batting consultant.
Gooch's first-innings score of 333, still the highest-ever individual innings score at Lord's, coupled with 123 in the second innings, remains a worldwide Test record.
But Robson kept his own county's statisticians busy on an otherwise tedious final day, first surpassing the highest number of runs made in a match at Lord's by a Middlesex batsman - the 319 set in 1893 by Andrew Stoddart.
By completing his hundred, he then equalled the match aggregate record by a Middlesex batsman in any first-class game, which was previously the 331 not out scored by Jack Robertson against Worcestershire at New Road in 1949.
Just before tea, he was stumped advancing down the track to Jeetan Patel's off spin, after which the remainder of the game focused on if and when Voges reached his century.
Middlesex captain Adam Voges told BBC Radio London:
"I'm disappointed we couldn't push for a result, having got them 173-6. But Jonathan Trott and Keith Barker batted well and took the game away from us.
"Sam's batting in this match has been phenomenal. His concentration has been so good as well as his technique.
"He can knock the door down in terms of getting selected again for England if he keeps batting like the way he is at the moment."
Middlesex opener Sam Robson told BBC Radio London:
"I'm thrilled to get runs again in the second innings. It has been a special few days. I know enough about the game to realise I am not going to have many days like that in my career, adding a hundred to a double hundred."
Warwickshire captain Ian Bell told BBC WM 95.6:
"The sun was out again and, at Lord's, that always makes batting an easier thing to do. But there wasn't much in the pitch.
"We felt that we needed to have got two more wickets on the third evening if we were to have a chance of pushing for victory.
"We still wanted to put Middlesex under pressure in the first hour this morning but Sam Robson played exceptionally well. He looks in very good order."
