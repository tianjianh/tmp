[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Eastleigh belatedly secured their first National League victory of 2017 with a home success against Barrow.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Goals from Sam Togwell and Matt Tubbs secured the hosts their first win in 11 league games - and first home victory since October.
Togwell gave Eastleigh the lead when he lashed a bouncing ball into the top corner of Jonathan Flatt's goal.
Tubbs, in his first game since rejoining the club, made it 2-0 in the first minute of the second period when he pounced after Flatt failed to hold on to the ball.
Barrow, who had lost one of their last six going into the game, could not produce a fightback, with Scott Wilson going close to adding a third for Eastleigh.
