Officers will be staging a reconstruction of the incident.
Det Ch Insp Ian Scott said he wanted anyone who was in the park that night to come forward.
He said: "Beyake was a young man who today should have been celebrating his 22nd birthday with family and friends.
"Instead of celebrating it with him, they will be remembering his life at what is and continues to be a very sad time for them.ã€€
"We are committed to getting justice for Beyake and his family and finding out who it was that inflicted his fatal injuries."ã€€
