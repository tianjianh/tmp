Three teenagers have been found guilty of the manslaughter of a young rapper who was stabbed to death in a fight over a stolen bicycle.

Myron Yarde, 17, aka Mdot, was stabbed five times in the leg in New Cross, south-east London, on 3 April.
Fauz Richards, 19, known as Mags or Maggie, and two youths both aged 16, were found guilty following an Old Bailey trial.
Judge Nicholas Cooke said "the evil" of knife crime had "to stop".
"Too many young men lose their lives in this way," he said.
The court heard Myron had lent his bike to 16-year-old Leoandro Osemeke, another promising rapper who was known as Showkey.
He would have been a witness at the trial but he too was fatally stabbed in an unrelated attack at a party in Peckham, south-east London, in August.
The court heard he had ridden the bike to buy pizza in the rival Monson neighbourhood where it was snatched.
When Myron - who was said to have been armed with a machete - went to get it back, he was attacked in Camplin Street after being cornered.
On hearing on Snapchat that Myron had been seriously injured, the 15-year-old defendant allegedly asked why Myron had come to Monson, followed by: "I think I've killed him".
When he was arrested four days later, he told officers: "Some people deserve to die, I just mean not everyone is innocent, including that boy that died."
The court heard that a kitchen knife found in Richards' back garden had Myron's blood on it.
All three defendants were initially on trial for murder.
Charlotte Edmonds, 32, and Jamie Kennedy, 31, of New Cross, were convicted of perverting the course of justice.
They will be sentenced on 13 January.
