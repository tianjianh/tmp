Florida suspect 'fled from police on hoverboard'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A Florida man suspected of a drug offence tried to flee from US police on his hoverboard, an affidavit seen by the BBC has said.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The suspect, Jerome Antoine Dennis, was approached in the town of Clearwater on Sunday evening by an officer who noticed the smell of marijuana.
Police said the man tried to escape by hoverboard, but was arrested. He has yet to enter a plea to two charges.
Hoverboards are wheeled devices with a top speed of just over 10mph (16km/h).
"When a visibly marked officer attempted to make contact with the defendant he attempted to flee on his hoverboard and then on foot before being apprehended," the affidavit reads.
"A strong odour of marijuana was on the person as well."
Mr Dennis was charged with possession of marijuana and resisting an officer.
