[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Netherlands have sacked head coach Danny Blind after two years in charge.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
It follows a 2-0 defeat by Bulgaria on Saturday that leaves the Netherlands fourth in their World Cup qualifying group at the halfway stage.
Blind, 55, took over as coach from Guus Hiddink in 2015, but his side failed to qualify for the European Championships in France last summer.
The Dutch FA said recent results left the team "with difficulty qualifying for the World Cup in Russia".
Fred Grim will take charge as interim coach when the Netherlands face Italy on Tuesday.
