Kezia Dugdale said she would announce her decision regarding the contest in the next few days.
At the weekend Mr Murphy told the media that he would step down from his role as leader next month.
Labour MSP Ken Macintosh confirmed he would stand for leadership of the party which lost 40 MPs in the election.
The results left the party in Scotland with just one MP, Ian Murray who represents the Edinburgh South constituency.
When Mr Murphy steps down in June, Ms Dugdale will become acting leader.
However, she has yet to say whether or not she wants to keep the job.
On Tuesday, Labour MSPs met at Holyrood for the first time since Mr Murphy's announcement.
On leaving the meeting, Ms Dugdale said she would share her intentions in the "next couple of days".
As his deputy, Kezia Dugdale will become acting leader when he goes.
Although Mr Macintosh has confirmed his intention to stand, he will not formally announce that until Labour's election rules are agrees.
