Pupils at Osmani School and Thomas Buxton School, 120m (394ft) apart in Whitechapel, were told to stay at home until 16 and 23 November respectively.
The spiders can give a "nasty bite which may cause an allergic reaction in vulnerable people", the schools warned.
Nests and eggs were found in the buildings and school grounds which are closed for fumigation.
"Pest control teams are currently on the premises of both schools, dealing with the infestation of false widow spiders," a spokesperson for Tower Hamlets Council said.
"The spiders are not considered to be dangerous but do bite.
"Due to health concerns for staff and pupils the schools will be closed until next week.
"If you are worried about the health of your child - in particular around spider bites - please do make sure that you refer your child to a local GP."

A statement published on both schools' websites said: "The safety and wellbeing of the children is our main concern so we have to take immediate action to deal with the problem.
"We are very sorry for the inconvenience and disruption to family life and also to the children's learning."
Osmani School is due to reopen on 16 November and Thomas Buxton on 23 November.
A spokesman for the Department for Education said it was aware of the closures and that the decision to send pupils home was a matter for the school.
