[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Nottingham Forest's potential new owners will return to England in early 2017 with the deal significantly advanced and completion imminent, BBC Sport understands.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The United States consortium, led by ex-San Diego Padres baseball team owner John Jay Moores, remains enthusiastic about the prospect of taking over.
Premier League Everton were previously of interest to Moore's consortium.
Kuwaiti Fawaz Al Hasawi has owned the Championship club since 2012.
It is also understood the new owners would favour appointing an experienced director of football at The City Ground.
The takeover would see Moores' consortium take an 80% stake in Forest.
Philippe Montanier's side are currently 18th in the second tier, six points above the relegation zone, prior to Friday's match against second-placed Newcastle United.
