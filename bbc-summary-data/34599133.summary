Richard Wheeler, 73, and reportedly from Sheffield, and his Trinidad-born wife Grace, 67, were found by a gardener.
Both had been stabbed, according to the Trinidad and Tobago Police Service (TTPS), who said robbery could have been a motive for the killings.
The Foreign Office said it was in touch with local authorities.
The local police said they were pursuing "certain leads" in connection with the murders.
Mrs Wheeler's body was found on the lawn outside their home in Carnbee at 11:00 local time on 20 October by a gardener who worked for the couple.
When police were called to the scene, they found the body of Mr Wheeler - who had lived in Tobago for 16 years - inside the house.
A family member living on the island was contacted by officers, the police force said.
TTPS said in a statement: "An initial assessment suggests robbery as the possible motive as the bedroom and living room areas were ransacked.
"However, all avenues are being explored and all leads pursued."
According to his profile on the website of Lex Caribbean, Mr Wheeler had been a solicitor since 1973 and attended the College of Law at Lancaster Gate, in London.
He was also a member of the Tobago Chamber of Commerce.
Diane Hadad, a director at the Chamber, told the BBC that Mr Wheeler had been a "well respected and established attorney". He had been a "serious individual" but with a "light laugh", she added.
Ms Hadad, who lived near the couple, said the local community was "alarmed and saddened" and called for a "swift response".
A Foreign Office spokesman said: ""Following the death of a British national in Tobago on October 20, our staff are travelling to the island to support family members at this difficult time.
"They will also meet senior police officers investigating this terrible crime after our High Commissioner spoke to Trinidad & Tobago's Police Commissioner earlier today."
