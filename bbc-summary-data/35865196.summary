Women's Super League: Chelsea Ladies can cause 'mayhem' in attack - Gemma Davison

Women's Super League champions Chelsea Ladies have the strength in depth and attacking quality to cause "mayhem" this season no matter who plays, according to winger Gemma Davison.

New signing Karen Carney joins fellow England stars Davison, Eni Aluko and Fran Kirby in a formidable front line that also includes Ji So-Yun.
Chelsea begin their WSL season against Doncaster Rovers Belles on Thursday.
"No one will be able to read what we can do," Davison, 28, told BBC Sport.
"We have so many options. Players can rest when needed and we are still dangerous all over pitch with players able to come on and cause complete mayhem."
Davison missed out on a place in the World Cup squad last summer, but has worked her way back into the England reckoning after playing a starring role as the Blues won the Women's FA Cup and League double in her first season with the club.
She started 25 out of Chelsea's 28 games in 2015 and has welcomed Carney's arrival, even if it means playing fewer games as a result.
Carney was on target on her debut as the Blues began their domestic season with a 4-1 victory over Thursday's opposition Doncaster in the FA Cup fifth round on Sunday.
"Having so many options makes everything more competitive. The training has gone up a level once more. It will benefit everyone massively," the former Arsenal and Liverpool winger said.
"Karen is top quality. She already looks like she has been here a long time.
"We are continuing to build as we did last season and there is definitely more depth to take us to another level. We want to compete in everything."
Despite dominating the domestic game, Chelsea could not replicate their success in Europe last season and were knocked out of the Champions League by Wolfsburg in the last 16.
And although Davison said they want to fight on all fronts this term, progress in the Champions League remains the ultimate challenge
"We want to win everything," Davison added. "We fell short last season but were pretty dominant in the league and want to be dominant again and push on even more.
"In the Champions League, I feel we under-estimated ourselves a bit and showed Wolfsburg a bit too much respect.
"They are a top-quality side with with world-class players but we have no reason to fear anyone. We take confidence from the performances, and the experience of last season."
