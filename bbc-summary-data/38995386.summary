[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Sean Kerr, from Bickenhill, Solihull, was convicted of nine animal cruelty charges after police and the RSPCA raided his puppy farm in December 2015.
A total of 37 puppies were seized, as well as one dead dog found in a plastic bag in a van parked at the farm.
Animal inspectors found puppies on floors coated with faeces and bedding soaked with urine, a court heard.
Kerr, 52, of Pastures Farm, Coventry Road, was sentenced at Birmingham Magistrates' Court on Thursday.

He was found guilty of six counts of causing unnecessary suffering to dogs and three offences of failing to meet the needs of a number of dogs following a trial.
Kerr was also banned from keeping dogs for life and ordered to pay Â£30,000 costs. He has said he will appeal against his conviction and sentence.
An investigation was launched after various complaints to the RSPCA and the farm was raided on 22 December 2015.
The dogs included a pregnant shih tzu, which was discovered cowering in a downstairs toilet, and a pregnant pug. The RSPCA said 27 puppies were later born in its care.
Most of the dogs rescued from the farm were fostered and all can now be rehomed.
Kerr has pleaded not guilty to a charge under the Fraud Act which will be heard at Birmingham Crown Court in March.
