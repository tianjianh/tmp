Ozra Johnson had spent hundreds of thousands of pounds renovating her childhood home in Hakin, near Milford Haven.
Pembrokeshire council, which maintains a footpath on the cliff edge, and Welsh Water, which owns a sewer that runs through the cliff face, both said they did not own the land.
Matt Murray went to see the damage.
