[SN]TITLE[SN]
Derby County 0-0 Burton Albion

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Derby County dominated but could not find a way past Nigel Clough's gutsy Burton Albion side, who earned a point from their first game at Pride Park.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Brewers boss Clough, who was sacked by the Rams in 2013, masterminded a display that ensures the hosts slipped 10 points outside the play-off spots after three home games without a win.
Darren Bent wasted Derby's best chance, somehow shooting over from two yards.
Burton frustrated the hosts after the interval but barely threatened.
The closest they came was when former Rams attacker Luke Varney headed an effort straight at Scott Carson just after Bent's miss.
Jacob Butterfield did force a fine save from visiting keeper Jon McLaughlin after the interval, but they could not create a telling opportunity and Burton held on for a point which takes them five points clear of the Championship relegation zone.
Derby County manager Steve McClaren:
"We are very disappointed with two points from three games when our home form has been excellent. We talked about a target but we've not achieved that.
"It was a yellow brick wall of four and six but I can't fault the players, we kept plugging away but it wasn't our night.
"Burton came for a draw and got it and it's been a frustrating night all round. Sometimes you can play for two days and not score and I think that was the situation tonight.
"When we came here we were fourth bottom and just dreaming of getting away and the players have done a marvellous job to go on a run, but I knew after the first three or four games this would be a frustrating season."
Burton Albion assistant boss Andy Garner:
"Proud is a bit of an understatement. It's incredible. We worked incredibly hard, we're honest enough to say we came for a point and for us to get that at Derby is absolutely unbelievable.
"That's what we are all about, honesty and hard work. We're not particularly good at times and the players will tell you that as well, but we dig deep and everybody works for each other.
"Nigel is in the dressing room, it's quite an emotional day for the gaffer. We had four magnificent years here, love the club and the fans so it's very emotional coming back for the first time and little Burton have taken four points off them so we're delighted.
"We didn't want to lose tonight, we set up for a point, worked all week training to get a point so I think it's good management really because we are going home with a point."
