The Range, Poundworld, Farmfoods and Greggs are to move into Marina Quay.
Talks are continuing with other firms to take up space in the second part of the project which has yet to get under way, developer Scarborough International Properties has said.
The funfair, which opened in the 1890s, was bulldozed in 2007.
The first phase of the development has been completed and construction on the next phase is due to start this winter.
Development director Paul Kelly said: "Completion of this first phase of Marina Quay is a significant event not just for Marina Quay, but for the town of Rhyl as a whole.
"This new retail and leisure development will play an important role in attracting further food and leisure operators, establishing Rhyl as a key shopping destination in Wales."
The developer believes in the region of 500 jobs could be created when the project is complete.
