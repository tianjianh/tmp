Jobs hope with 'green energy park' plan for Chapelcross

More than 500 jobs could be created at the former Chapelcross nuclear plant, according to the green energy firm behind ambitious plans for the site.

Scotia Global Energy wants to build an experimental "green energy park" at the facility near Annan.
They claim the 90 hectare (222 acres) site is "ideally positioned" for such a development.
The company has pitched its plans to the Scottish government and Dumfries and Galloway Council.
Scottish Enterprise and the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority (NDA) have also been briefed on the firm's proposals.
The plans include:
Its existing electricity grid connection, its proximity to the gas grid and the water abstraction facilities that are on site are an "ideal mix", the report added.
It claims a development company set up to manage the early stages of the project could initially support five jobs.
However, the report said: "As the site matures, the manufacturing supply chain operations could support several hundreds of jobs conceivably exceeding the site's historical peak of 500 jobs."
A spokesman for Dumfries and Galloway Council said it was working with Scottish Enterprise and the NDA on the regeneration of the Chapelcross site.
He added: "The partners recognise that the Chapelcross site represents a major opportunity to attract inward investment and create new jobs which will have a positive impact on the regional economy.
"The vision for the site is to develop a sustainable, mixed use approach providing opportunities for large and small scale businesses across a range of sectors.
"It is highly likely that the energy sector will play a prominent role within that mix, with opportunities for research and development, generation, and storage."
Scottish Enterprise confirmed that it is a member of the South of Scotland Alliance, which is "actively engaged" in discussions on the future of the site.
A spokesman for the NDA said they have had one "exploratory meeting" with a representative of Scotia Global Energy.
He added: "The idea for an 'integrated energy centre' seems to fit in general terms with the emerging development framework for the Chapelcross site but we would need considerably more details before giving serious consideration to this proposal."
