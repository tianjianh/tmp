Ewers found the top corner with a powerful 77th-minute shot after a fine pull-back by substitute Ellie Brazil.
But the hosts had goalkeeper Ann-Katrin Berger to thank for keeping them level.
She made superb first-half saves from Kim Little, Danielle Carter and Danielle van de Donk.
Katie McCabe and Jordan Nobbs were both off target in the second period as Arsenal continued to have the better of things before Ewers struck.
The draw for the semi-finals will take place live on BBC Radio 5 Live at 14:45 BST on Monday, 27 March.
