[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
National League side Southport have named former Chester boss Steve Burr as their new manager.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 56-year-old was sacked by Chester in April after a run of just one win in 10 put the club in a relegation fight.
Southport relieved Andy Bishop of his duties on Saturday with the side lying second from bottom in the table.
Ex-Kidderminster boss Burr takes over a side that has picked up four points from their first eight league matches of the season, suffering six defeats.
