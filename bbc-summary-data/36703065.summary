The Netherlands international, 26, had a year to run on his QPR contract but had stated his desire to remain with Francesco Guidolin's team.
Swansea are also expected to conclude a deal for Ajax's Mike van der Hoorn.
Defender Hoorn, a Netherlands U21 international, is understood to have agreed personal terms.

He earned the first of his 11 Holland caps in 2010 and was part of the squad for the 2014 World Cup in Brazil.
Fer was part of the Rangers side relegated from the Premier League in 2014-15 and suffered the same fate with Norwich in the previous season.
Swansea will go into the 2016-17 season under new ownership after an American consortium bought a controlling stake in the club.
