Jack Vettriano winds up publishing firm

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A publishing company set up by the artist Jack Vettriano has been wound up.

Heartbreak Publishing, set up seven years ago by the Fife-born artist, sold prints, posters and postcards of his work and of other artists.
Mr Vettriano, the company's majority shareholder, said it was a business decision to place the company in voluntary liquidation.
His prints will still be available from his own website.
Mr Vettriano said: "This is purely a business decision and involves a return of the company's assets to the shareholders.
