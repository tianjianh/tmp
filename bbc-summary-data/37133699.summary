The Invergordon lifeboat was launched and local coastguards teams deployed at about 14:30.
As they headed to the scene it was reported that the dinghy had come to rest on a sandbank.
The local coastguards on the ground were able to reach the inflatable vessel and help the occupants to safety.
Invergordon Lifeboat spokesman Michael MacDonald said: "They were lucky to come to rest on a sandbank.
"If the wind had picked up it could have been blown them further out with the tide also on it's way out and they could have been put in more danger."
