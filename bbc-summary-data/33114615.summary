Queen's Birthday Honours: Disappointment over leaks

The chairman of the committee that oversees the Queen's Birthday Honours list said he was "disappointed" that key names were leaked before the official announcement.

Sir Jonathan Stephens said the leaks created uncertainty and pointed out that they were sometimes wrong.
The news of Lenny Henry's knighthood and Benedict Cumberbatch's CBE broke earlier this week.
At the end of last year an inquiry was launched when the same thing happened.
Awards to actors Joan Collins, James Corden and Sheridan Smith were mentioned prematurely in the press.
Reports said rugby player Jonny Wilkinson was set to receive a knighthood before it emerged that he was not included.
This year he has become a CBE.
Sir Jonathan said the Honours Committee had tightened security, but would have to look again at its practices.
"We made a number of changes to tighten up procedure and to tighten up access and we'll obviously be looking to learn lessons again from the experience this time," he said.
"Sometimes of course the leaks are inaccurate, so we treat it very seriously."
Honour recipients find out weeks in advance, but are urged to keep the news confidential as are Cabinet officials until the announcement.
Dame Esther Rantzen said she suspected whoever was revealing the information was "doing it for money".
The Childline founder and TV presenter, whose own inclusion in the New Year Honours list emerged before the formal announcement, said: "I think it is mean - it is like opening a Christmas present before Christmas Day."
She told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: "There is someone in the mysterious smoke-filled rooms who is looking at the list.
"Whoever is doing it...  I think they are being paid quite a lot, because of Lenny Henry, a big name, and big articles and front page and all that.
"But I wish they wouldn't because it is taking candy from a baby. The nation like the surprise package."
