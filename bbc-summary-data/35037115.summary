[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Irish police believe Ivan Vaughan, whose stage name was Simon Scott, was swept away by flood water after getting out of his car as he returned from Glaslough on Sunday evening.
The victim was 70 and from Caledon in County Tyrone.
He was found at about 11:25 local time at Corraghdown, Glaslough.
Mr Vaughan's body was found about 10 metres from his car.
Vinny O'Donnell was a lifelong friend of Mr Vaughan.
"He was a good friend of mine and a great entertainer and it's a very, very, very sad loss. especially for his loving family who must be feeling it now just tragically coming up to Christmas," he said.
Mr O'Donnell heard about his friend's death from a fellow musician.
"My first thought was pure and utter shock, I couldn't take it in," he said.
"You try to put in your mind what was going through his head hitting that flood at night, we're never going to know.
"It's just another tragic, very tragic accident and for him to be taken from us in such a way. It's just very hard to take in."
He said that in his heyday, Mr Vaughan was "very debonair and very good looking".
"All the women just adored him but he was a very, very talented singer and performer. His one man shows were brilliant, very professional.
"There will be a lot of fans who will be very sad to hear such tragic news.
"Apart from the music, he'll be remembered as a very warm-hearted, very genuine, very warm, well-manned person. He was a pure gentleman, sadly he's gone."
Irish police said Mr Vaughan's death did not appear to be suspicious.
He had been reported missing earlier on Monday morning.
Mr Vaughan performed with the group the Plattermen in the 1960s and 70s and recently worked as a solo artist.
