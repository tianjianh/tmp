Funeral mix-up mother finally buried in Fareham

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A mother has been buried by her family almost a week after her first funeral was postponed by the council, less than two hours before the service.

Sarah Eatwell, from Tockenham in Wiltshire, was due to lay her mother, Shelia Bizley, to rest on 10 April.
She was due to use the same plot as her father at Fareham, in Hampshire, but, on the way to the service, she was told the original grave was not deep enough.
At the time, the borough council issued the family an "unreserved apology".
The council - which said Ms Eatwell's father had been buried in a single plot instead of a double - had to apply to the Ministry of Justice to exhume his remains to widen the grave.
Ms Eatwell previously told the BBC the situation was "very, very distressing".
The family paid for a double plot when their father, Kenelm Bizley, died 27 years ago.
Fareham Borough Council paid for "all associated costs" in relation to the new funeral date, a spokeswoman said.
Ms Eatwell added: "It is something you just cannot imagine ever happening.
"It should not happen. Funerals are never easy but for this to happen... words can't describe it."
Council leader Sean Woodward, who "apologised unreservedly" to the family, said: "Clearly a mistake was made over 27 years ago and the only record that remains shows that there should have been a double grave."
