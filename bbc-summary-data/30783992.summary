Fire fighters responded to nearly 90 fires as rubbish bins and discarded sofas were set alight.
Officers on foot, horseback, and in vehicles tried to control the crowds as they poured out of bars after the win.
Ohio State beat Oregon 42-20 to capture the College Football Playoff national championship title.
The championship game was being played in Arlington, Texas, but revellers 1,000 miles away converged on the winning team's home stadium where they were turned away by police.
The fans and students then returned to an area with many sports bars, where police attempted to herd crowds onto sidewalks.
It was at this point that police employed pepper spray and tear gas in an attempt to control the crowds.
The raucous celebrations began around 1am local time (0600 GMT) and lasted for approximately two hours, with the last fire reported around 4:45 a.m.
The Columbus Dispatch reported that some gunfire was reported in the vicinity of the campus following the game, but no gun-related injuries were reported.
