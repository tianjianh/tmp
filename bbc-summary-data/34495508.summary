A 57-year-old man died after being struck by a car in a hit-and-run on Edinburgh's Comiston Road.
The incident took place at about 20:10 on Thursday.
The man who died had fallen onto the road before being hit by a small dark-coloured vehicle and police said the driver may not have realised what happened.
Ch Insp James Jones said: "Our investigations have shown that it is possible that the driver of the vehicle may not have been immediately aware they had struck a person.
"We would ask that anyone driving in the area of Comiston Road (Buckstone Terrace) around 8 pm on Thursday get in touch with us."
