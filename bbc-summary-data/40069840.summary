The child had been walking with his mother along a pathway off Carleton Road, Cheshunt, at 21:40 BST on Monday.
Police say two women and a man who were with the dogs left the scene without giving their details. The animals were not on leads.
The boy's injuries were not life-threatening. He is now recovering at home.
PC Abigail Owen, of Hertfordshire Police said: "The dogs were not on leads at the time of the incident and the victim suffered several dog bite injuries, which required hospital treatment.
"The owners of the dogs made no attempt to give their details to the victim's mother and left the scene with their pets."
The dogs are described as having brown-grey, long, fine fur and a wolf-like appearance. Both animals wore plain red collars.
Police are appealing for witnesses.
