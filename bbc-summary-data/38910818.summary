[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Travellers who sparked a Supreme Court legal battle by pitching at a site for more than seven years have left.

Royal Borough of Windsor and Maidenhead spent Â£160,000 trying to move 10 caravans from Shurlock Row, Berkshire.
Those occupying the land lost appeals and finally a judicial review bid to remain at the site in 2016.
The authority said the group had now left voluntarily and an order imposed to restore the site to its original condition within 28 days.
Councillor Derek Wilson said residents in the area had been "waiting for this day".
He added: "The occupiers were in breach of planning control and we followed every procedure correctly to get to this point as swiftly as was legally possible."
Grass had been paved over and machinery installed without planning permission following the group's arrival in December 2009, the council said.
An enforcement notice was issued ordering them to stop using the land.
The travellers lodged an appeal in 2010 which was unsuccessful and they were given until February 2013 to leave but failed to do so.
After another unsuccessful appeal, they applied for a judicial review.
This was refused by the High Court, the Court of Appeal and finally the Supreme Court in August 2016.
