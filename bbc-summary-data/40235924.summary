Worcestershire v Glamorgan: Michael Hogan leads visitors to nine-wicket win

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Glamorgan beat Worcestershire by nine wickets inside three days, as Michael Hogan picked up his third five-wicket haul in three games as captain.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Worcestershire, trailing by 80 runs overnight, were bowled out for only 129 just after lunch, losing wickets at regular intervals.
Lukas Carey (3-34) and Timm van der Gugten (2-39) provided accurate support for Hogan (5-38).
Glamorgan knocked off the 16 needed for the loss of one wicket.
It is the first time Glamorgan have won back-to-back Championship games since 2015, while Worcestershire's below-par batting in their second innings means they have lost two successive games after beginning with four straight wins.
It was an incredible transformation for Glamorgan after slumping to 58-6 on the first evening, before dominating the rest of the match.
Worcestershire's Australian spinner Nathan Lyon has now left the club with compatriot John Hastings returning from international duties.
Glamorgan captain Michael Hogan told BBC Wales Sport:
"We expected a day of graft and we approached it that way, but we bowled really well, everyone did their job and I couldn't ask for anything more.
"We caught everything and we built pressure after we didn't do that in the first innings, it was perfect.
"We were (under the cosh) on the first day, but some good tekkers from Andy (Salter), Jacques (Rudolph) played really well, Chris (Cooke) and Lukas (Carey) got us into a great position."
Worcestershire captain Joe Leach told BBC Hereford & Worcester:
"We've had a very poor day and a session there having had a very good day one, thanks to Ben Cox's 93 which was a brilliant effort, he fought very hard as did Ed Barnard and then Josh Tongue's spell on Friday evening was international calibre.
"But from then it's been a catalogue of errors and we're not happy with it. To not even give them a score to get in the fourth innings is unacceptable. We draw  a line under it and we go again first of all in the (One-Day Cup) semi-final then against Kent (in the Championship)."
