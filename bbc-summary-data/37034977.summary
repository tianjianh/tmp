Fresh from the national team's success at Euro 2016, the BSc (Hons) Football Coaching and the Performance Specialist qualification will begin in September.
Students will be based at the university's Colliers Park training facility.
It has been designed for those who want to work as a coach or performance specialist.
Students will work towards the FAW Level 2 (UEFA C) and Level 3 (UEFA B) coaching licenses.
On completion they will have the skills to coach youth and senior football teams at grassroots and a high performance level.
Pamela Richards, associate head of the university's school of social and life sciences, said: "We are honoured to be working alongside the FAW Trust, especially at such a positive and successful time for the Wales team.
"The footballers in the Welsh national side are inspiring future generations of footballers and coaches."
