'Graph of Doom' warning to Highland councillors

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The structure of Highland Council must change to help it cope better with cuts in funding, councillors have been told.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
In a paper to councillors, officers quote research such as a London borough council's "Graph of Doom" showing the effect of spending cuts on services.
The Highland officials also make reference to political commentators describing a period of "perma-austerity" for local government.
They recommend that the council reviews its priorities.
At a special meeting on Thursday, councillors will be asked to approve the start of work to reassess the council's structure, how it spends money and how it runs it services.
Officers have recommended that this process be inclusive and closely involve trade unions and the wider public.
"Citizens juries" could be set up across the region and used as "sounding boards" for controversial proposals, the officials have suggested.
An outline timescale for the re-design would see councillors agreeing to proposals by the end of this year and changes taking effect early next year.
Last month, Highland Council set its latest budget after councillors agreed to a package of savings.
The Graph of Doom was produced by Barnet Council several years ago to demonstrate rising costs in services and the squeeze on its funding.
