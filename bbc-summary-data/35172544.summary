The manoeuvre, which saw the van turning around and driving back the wrong way, was captured by Marek Scyzor near junction 33 at Milton, Cambridgeshire.
He sent the footage to the BBC Radio Cambridgeshire.
Cambridgeshire Police said: "Congestion and accidents can cause tailbacks and delays on the county's roads but that is no excuse for this type of driving behaviour."
