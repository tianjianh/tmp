Organisers of the event have billed it as the largest of its kind to be held in the UK.
The conference has been jointly organised by the Finland-based Digital Games Research Association (DiGRA) and the Foundations of Digital Games (FDG)
The five-day event is being held at Abertay University.
The results of new research, including designing for virtual reality, will be unveiled at the conference.
Jim Whitehead, president of the Society for the Advancement of Digital Games said: "Abertay University is among the oldest computer game programs in the world, and has been a long time leader in games education.
"It was a natural match to host the first ever DiGRA/FDG conference in Dundee"
The event will coincide with the Dare Protoplay gaming festival, which runs from 4 to 7 August in the Caird Hall and City Square.
