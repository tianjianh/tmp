[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man cleared of burglary after being caught dangling upside down from the window of a Nottingham Trent University building has been sentenced for thefts from the city's other university.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Carl Attar admitted stealing clothes from laundry rooms at the University of Nottingham earlier in March.
In January, he claimed he had been finding somewhere to sleep after he was caught trapped in the window.
Attar was handed a two-year community order at Nottingham Magistrates' Court.
Attar, 27, who is homeless, had admitted at a previous hearing entering a student's laundry room at the Newark halls of residence at the University of Nottingham on 5 March and stealing clothes to the value of Â£20.
On 13 March he stole more clothes from another laundry room on the university's Jubilee Campus.
In January, Attar was trapped for five hours in a window about 8ft (2.4m) off the ground at Nottingham Trent University's Arkwright building and had to be rescued by firefighters.
He claimed he had been trying to find somewhere warm to sleep and was cleared of attempted burglary.
Speaking after that hearing he said: "I'm not a burglar. I was just trapped. It's like a lesson being taught. I'm changing my ways."
On Monday, Nottingham magistrates also imposed a drug rehabilitation order and banned him from entering the grounds and buildings of the two universities for the next two years.
