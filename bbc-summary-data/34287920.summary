The extended three-year deal keeps the Grand Slam free to air and includes live online and radio coverage.
BBC director general Tony Hall said Wimbledon "unites the nation" and that he was "delighted" with the deal.
He added: "In what are difficult financial times, the deal represents the BBC's commitment to sport in what is an incredibly competitive market."
Novak Djokovic won his third men's singles title at Wimbledon this year, while Serena Williams won her sixth women's crown.
In what is the longest partnership in sports broadcasting history, the tournament will continue to be played out across BBC One, BBC Two, the BBC Red Button and the BBC Sport website, with live radio coverage on Radio 5 live.
The BBC first broadcast from Wimbledon in 1937.
"Our long partnership with the BBC has brought the excitement and drama of the championships to viewers and listeners for over 80 years and we are delighted to be extending our successful association for a further three years until 2020," said All England Club chief executive Richard Lewis.
"The BBC consistently delivers large national audiences for Wimbledon and they deliver those audiences with high-quality production values, live across multiple platforms and always with a strong narrative.
"Importantly, as host broadcaster for the championships, the BBC also ensures that we can provide a comprehensive and premium service to our global media partners."
Barbara Slater, director of BBC Sport, added: "Wimbledon has a special place in the hearts of the nation and our new agreement ensures the world's greatest tennis championships can be enjoyed free to air by the widest possible audience.
"Through unparalleled coverage across TV, radio and online, Wimbledon on the BBC will continue to unite the nation through must-see sporting moments, captivating audiences of all ages."
