Double killer's 'voices in head' claim 'a bit clichéd'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A teenager's claim that voices told him to kill two people are "a bit clichéd" and "extremely unconvincing", a psychiatrist has told a jury.

The youth, 17, who cannot be named, admits killing James Attfield and Nahid Almanea in Colchester, Essex, in 2014.
He has denied murder on grounds of diminished responsibility, saying he was suffering from psychosis.
Dr Philip Joseph told Guildford Crown Court the claims were "like something you might see in a horror film".
He described the boy's auditory and visual hallucinations as "extremely unconvincing".
"Every time he's talking about voices he's doing it to distance himself from what he's done," Dr Joseph said.
He told the court how the teenager had said he was "on a mission from the devil" when he killed Mr Attfield, 33, and Ms Almanea, 31.
Mr Attfield was found near the town's Castle Park with 102 knife wounds in March 2014. Ms Almanea was stabbed to death on Salary Brook Trail three months later.
The trial, which has entered its second week, has previously heard a knife was found in the lining of a school blazer belonging to the teenager.
The jury has also been told the boy admitted watching violent and pornographic films and had violent sexual fantasies.
The defendant was described as having a fascination with serial killers, and was particularly interested in Yorkshire Ripper Peter Sutcliffe, and serial killers Steve Wright and Ted Bundy, Dr Joseph said.
The boy told Dr Joseph he had been bullied at school from the age of 11, and after that he had started hearing voices.
The court had previously been told his behaviour had become increasingly violent as he grew older and he was "a thug" who kicked and headbutted fellow pupils.
The trial continues.
