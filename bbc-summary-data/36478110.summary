[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Six weeks of repair work on the A9 which will see traffic reduced to 10mph in places will begin on 13 June.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Four locations between Perth and Inverness will be resurfaced as part of a Â£1.2m Transport Scotland investment.
The first work will begin at the A9 Drumochter southbound carriageway for two weeks.
Bear Scotland said the 10mph convoy system will be in place at the locations during working hours for the safety of road workers and motorists.
The work at Drumochter will be carried out on a 1km stretch of road between Mondays and Fridays.
Resurfacing will take place overnight for two weeks on a 1km section of road at Newmill, near Luncarty, from 19 June.
Work between 07:00 and 19:00 will also be carried out on 500m sections of road at Ballinluig for two weeks from 27 June and at Badacreamh from 11 July.
Eddie Ross from Bear Scotland, which maintains the route, said the work would "greatly improve" the condition and safety of the route.
He said: "We've taken steps to minimise disruption as much as possible by avoiding working at weekends at all four sites, and carrying out work overnight at Newmill where the route is single-carriageway."
