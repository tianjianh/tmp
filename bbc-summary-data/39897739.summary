Sculptor Andy Scott has submitted proposals to East Lothian Council for the tribute to John Muir, the forefather of North America's national parks, who was born in Dunbar.
A frame will be made of the grizzly bear before it is clad in steel and erected on a plinth and grassy mound.
It has been commissioned by landowners, Hallhill Developments, off the A1.
Mr Scott told the BBC Scotland news website he was asked to create a sculpture for the site and decided to pay tribute to John Muir.
He said: "John Muir is an influential character, especially in today's environmental climate.
"There are different levels of interpretation with sculpture and I chose a bear as a subtle tribute to him.
"I wanted to do something about his role in the national parks and I thought an animal would be a symbol of the wilderness he was a passionate advocate of."
An East Lothian Council spokeswoman said: "The council's planners will provide a recommendation in due course."
The Kelpies, 30m-high horse head sculptures in Falkirk, were completed in 2013 at a cost of Â£5m.
