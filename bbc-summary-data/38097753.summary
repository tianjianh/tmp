[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Cameras captured the moment David Drury asked the driver to move his car from zigzag lines next to a pedestrian crossing on the Isle of Sheppey.
As a parking ticket was being printed, the driver accelerated towards him and knocked him over, before driving off. It was captured on a body worn camera.
Mr Drury suffered neck and shoulder injuries.
The incident took place on 8 July on High Street, Eastchurch. No arrests were made.
Police have now re-issued an image of a man they would like to speak to.
