The 32-year-old managed to force the intruders out of the property in Willow Court, Toxteth, but was shot as they left, at about 21:45 GMT on Wednesday.
His partner and children, aged one and six weeks, were in the house during the attack, Merseyside Police said.
The men, wearing balaclavas, are believed to have escaped in a car and officers are appealing for information.
The victim was taken to hospital where he is being treated for shotgun wound to his arm. His condition is not believed to be life threatening.
Det Sgt Adam Smith said: "The fact that these people saw fit to threaten and attack a man at his own home, whilst his partner and two young children were in the house, shows the mentality of these people, who have a complete disregard for others.
"Our inquiries are clearly at a very early stage, although it does appear that this was a targeted incident."
