[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A brother and sister whose bodies were found at the foot of cliffs in Dover have been identified by police.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Twins Muriel and Bernard Burgess, aged 59, were discovered on New Year's Day.
The pair, both from the village of Elton in Cheshire, were found when Kent Police began a search for the body of 45-year-old Scott Enion, 45, from Manchester.
His death is not connected to the twins and all three deaths are being treated as non-suspicious.
Kent Police have appealed for help tracing the last movements of the twins.
They were wearing dark wet-weather clothing and police believe they may have been seen at the top of the cliffs between Boxing Day and New Year's Day.
