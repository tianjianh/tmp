Numerous fire and police vehicles were dispatched to the Froghall Gardens area, homes were evacuated and roads were closed.
The Scottish Fire and Rescue Service said it was alerted to reports of a fire within a property at just after 10:25. Six appliances were sent. One local spoke of hearing a bang.
A rest centre at Froghall Community Centre was being set up for residents.
A Scottish Fire and Rescue Service spokesman said: "Six appliances attended and five firefighters dressed in protective breathing apparatus extinguished the fire using a high-power hose.
"Nearby properties were evacuated as a precaution and one individual was safely removed from the affected property via a ladder with assistance from firefighters.
"The casualty did not require medical treatment and crews ensured the area was made safe before leaving the scene."
Scottish and Southern Electricity Networks (SSEN) confirmed they had been asked to cut power supplies to 81 properties in the area.
In a statement, the company said: "We would like to thank our customers for their patience whilst we work with the fire service to restore supplies safely. We apologise for any inconvenience that this may cause and will remain on site until all supplies can be restored."
