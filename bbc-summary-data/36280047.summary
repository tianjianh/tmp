[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Jane Park, 21, pleaded guilty to assaulting door steward Lee Rutherford at Edinburgh's City Nightclub on 1 February 2015.
Edinburgh Sheriff Court heard Park, from Edinburgh, who won the lotto aged 17, slapped Mr Rutherford.
Her friend Jordan Archibald, 25, meanwhile struggled with Police Scotland Sgt Kevin Smith.
He also attempted to headbutt Sgt Smith.
The story emerged during a hearing on Thursday before Sheriff Peter Braid.
The pair, both of Edinburgh, changed their not guilty pleas and admitted their involvement shortly before their trial was due to begin.
Archibald, who lives in the city's Leith area, pleaded guilty to struggling with Sgt Smith and attempting to headbutt him.
Sheriff Braid fined Archibald £180 and fined Park £110.
Passing sentence, Sheriff Braid told Park: "I will impose a financial penalty.
"Your conduct was unacceptable. You assaulted a gentleman who was doing his job."
Park won the £1m Euromillions prize at the age of 17.
