Australia's government will give A$10m ($7.1m; Â£4.7m) in funding to a community prepared to house a permanent nuclear waste dump.

Six sites across the country have been shortlisted to host the dump, which would be Australia's first.
The facility would house low-level and intermediate waste, which is currently stored across more than 100 sites.
Resources and Energy Minister Josh Frydenberg said no community would be forced to take on the facility.
"We won't unilaterally pick one, this is a voluntary community consultative process," Mr Frydenberg told the ABC.
He said landowners stood to receive four times the value of their property if it was purchased for the development.
Any community prepared to host the site would also receive A$10m towards local projects, he said.
The six shortlisted sites are Sally's Flat in NSW, Hale in the Northern Territory, Cortlinye, Pinkawillinie and Barndioota in South Australia and Oman Ama in Queensland.
They were chosen from a list of 28 locations nominated voluntarily by landholders.
A final decision is expected after Australia's next federal election.
Mr Fydenberg said low-level waste included items such as gloves, goggles, paper or plastic that were used in nuclear medicine.
Intermediate waste could include steel rods used in nuclear reactors, he said.
"More than 100 sites across the country, including hospitals and universities, are licensed to store this waste on an interim basis," he said.
