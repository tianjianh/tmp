The 18 and 21-year-old men, from Cwmbran, were taken in on suspicion of arson, and have since been bailed by Gwent Police.
The blaze broke out at Coed Eva Primary School, in Cwmbran, at about 02:25 GMT on New Year's Day.
In the days following the fire, four teenage boys were arrested and bailed pending further inquiries.
Torfaen council said it would build temporary classrooms within two weeks but rain could delay their installation.
A spokesman said the insurance company would only cover the cost of the existing building, which would be minimal compared to the cost of a new building.
Following a meeting with staff, insurers, governors and the council, head teacher Gill Ellis said everyone had been "overwhelmed" by the response from the community.
Teachers are now considering plans to accommodate all pupils on site using temporary classrooms and extra space in the junior school building.
Meanwhile, demolition workers have assessed the site and fencing will be erected around the fire-damaged building.
Dermot McChrystal, Torfaen council's chief education officer, said a replacement school could take two years, but the priority was to ensure the school's pupils could return to education soon.
