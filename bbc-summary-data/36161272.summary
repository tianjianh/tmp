Mamadou Sakho: Liverpool defender suspended for 30 days by Uefa

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Liverpool defender Mamadou Sakho has been suspended for 30 days by Uefa after it opened disciplinary proceedings against him following a failed drugs test.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The suspension is provisional until a final decision is taken by Uefa's control, ethics and disciplinary body.
Sakho, 26, tested positive for what is thought to be a type of fat burner after the Europa League win against Manchester United on 17 March.
He chose not to challenge the results.
European football's governing body added Sakho "did not request the analysis of the B sample".
The date of a disciplinary hearing will be announced at a later stage.
The France international and his club had already agreed he would remain unavailable while a Uefa investigation was completed.
Sakho's Liverpool team-mate Kolo Toure was banned for six months in 2011 while at Manchester City after testing positive for a weight-loss drug contained within "water tablets" recommended to him by his wife.
Should Uefa decide on a similar ban for Sakho, it would rule him out of Euro 2016 in France, which starts on 10 June.
The suspension will be backdated to Thursday, the day it was issued, no matter when the disciplinary hearing is set for.
An Â£18m signing from Paris St-Germain in 2013, Sakho has played 34 games for Liverpool this season, including 10 in the Europa League.
