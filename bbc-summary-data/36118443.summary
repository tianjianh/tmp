Accrington Stanley edged closer to promotion to League One as Mark Hughes' second-half tap-in saw them beat Wycombe Wanderers.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Stanley will guarantee a first-ever season in the third tier if they win at home to Stevenage on 7 May.
The Lancashire side remain two points clear of Bristol Rovers, who were 4-1 winners at York City.
Hughes tapped in from close range after Wycombe keeper Benjamin Siegrist tipped Josh Windass's free-kick onto the post.
Wycombe went close to taking an early lead when Aaron Pierre fired over from close range.
But the Chairboys' debutant keeper Siegrist, who is on loan from Aston Villa, kept them in the game in the early stages by denying Windass and Brad Halliday.
