An orphaned otter cub discovered on a Pembrokeshire roadside has beaten pneumonia and is fighting back to health.

The cub nicknamed 'Star' was so ill when found by a member of the public at Llanfyrnach, they though he was dead.
But after some tender care from the RSPCA, and a shot of antibiotics for his chest infection, the eight-week old otter is on the road to recovery.
It is hoped Star will now be released back to the wild when he is old enough.
Animal collection officer Ellie West said she did not expect the cub to survive the night when he was found on 8 January.
"He was started on antibiotics by a vet as he had pneumonia and I gave him injections of fluids under the skin to try and hydrate him as at that time he was far too weak to swallow fluids properly," she explained.
"After a few hours he was much warmer and comfortable and he actually suckled rehydration fluids from a syringe.
"I couldn't believe the change in him in less than 24 hours. He is a real little fighter, bless him."
Star is now being cared for at the RSPCA's specialist otter facility at West Hatch, Somerset.
The RSPCA officer said it was clear the cub had become separated from its mother, and without intervention Star would have died.
However, the charity said it is vitally important that anyone spotting a lone wild animal should monitor it first to ensure it is genuinely abandoned or orphaned, before attempting to pick it up or touch it.
