Judd Trump sealed his place in the Players Championship semi-final with a 5-3 victory against Ronnie O'Sullivan in Llandudno.

Trump hit breaks of 86, 113 and 60 on his way to victory against O'Sullivan, who struggled to gain a foothold.
O'Sullivan did score 109 to make it 4-3 but fellow Englishman Trump took the final frame to reach the last four.
Earlier, Ding Junhui fought back from 4-0 down to beat John Higgins and secure his place in the quarter-finals.
Scotland's Higgins had seemed on course for a routine victory before China's Ding mounted a remarkable recovery.
Ding scored 83 and 67 to close the deficit and levelled with a clearance of 107 and then edging the decider.
Welsh Open runner-up Trump will now face either Ali Carter or Neil Robertson in the semi-final.
Carter battled past world number four Shaun Murphy 5-4 earlier in the day and will face Australian Robertson in the last eight on Thursday.
Elsewhere, world number five Junhui will face Anthony Hamilton in the last eight while Mark Selby plays Marco Fu.
