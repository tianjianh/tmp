Manager Chris Coleman had urged his bosses to keep games at the venue used in the Euro 2016 qualifiers.
FAW chief executive Jonathan Ford said the 72,500-capacity Principality Stadium was an option.
But qualifiers against Moldova, Georgia and Serbia will all be held at Cardiff City's home, which holds 33,000.
Wales will start their 2018 World Cup qualifiers against Moldova on 5 September. They face Georgia on 9 October and Serbia on 12 November.
The FAW have not announced where the qualifiers against Austria and the Republic of Ireland in 2017 will be staged.
Ford has stated Wales will play a football match at the Principality Stadium before it hosts the 2017 Champions League final, but conceded it might be a friendly.
Wales last played at the home of Welsh rugby in a 2-0 Euro 2012 qualifier defeat by England in March 2011.
