Billy Root: Is Joe about to get some England sibling rivalry?

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Living in the sizeable shadow of the "most complete batsman" England has ever produced can't be easy, but 23-year-old Billy Root seems to making a good fist of it.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Billy's older brother Joe, 25, has become England's main man in the international set-up in all formats for the past couple of years, playing a vital role in both the Ashes glory of 2015 and the run to the World Twenty20 Cup final earlier this month.
But Billy, who plays for Nottinghamshire, appears to be showing signs he has some of his brother's quality too, hitting his maiden first-class century for Leeds Bradford MCCU in their drawn match against Sussex.
Root junior scored 133 from 214 balls in the three-day game, with one six and 11 fours.
There's still some way to go catch up with his big brother.
