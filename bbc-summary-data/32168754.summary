Snooker: Amateur John Sutton found guilty of match-fixing

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Amateur snooker player John Sutton has been found guilty of match-fixing after a 6-0 defeat by Jamie Burnett in 2014.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Following a hearing last week, the World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association (WPBSA) found him in breach of two rules, one of fixing and one of misusing inside information.
It will decide on a sanction against the Irishman at a later date, likely to be next month.
There is no suggestion Burnett was involved in any wrongdoing.
Sutton is not a member of the WPBSA and does not hold a World Snooker tour card.
He accepted an invitation to play, and was beaten by Burnett, in an International Championships qualifier in Barnsley in September 2014.
Suspicious betting patterns on the game were reported.
Married father-of-four Sutton is a business development manager who practises between five and 10 hours a week.
He told World Snooker last year that his strengths are his "temperament and never-know-when-I'm-beaten attitude" but that his weakness is "consistency".
"I'm good one day and awful the next," he said, adding his idols are Steve Davis and Stephen Hendry "due to their commitment and dedication to the game".
