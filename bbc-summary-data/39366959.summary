[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Barnaby Cork was out with his family when he was struck outside the Thame Leisure Centre in Oxfordshire.
His father Stefan had dropped off his wife and two other children for swimming lessons on 10 December when it happened.
Barnaby got out of the car and he reversed and hit the youngster, Oxford Coroner's Court heard.
Coroner Darren Salter recorded the cause of death as accidental.
He said: "This is clearly a tragic case... the sad facts of this incident are not in dispute.
"I offer my condolences on the loss of a young boy in these awful circumstances."
The boy's family did not attend the inquest, but Mr Cork gave written evidence and said that he did not see or hear the youngster, as he was shorter than the back window.
In a statement at the time of the boy's death, his family said: "We're truly devastated at the loss of our precious Barnaby. We're absolutely heartbroken.
"There's no words that can even begin to describe the sadness we're experiencing now that Barnaby isn't with us. He was our world."
Mr Cork set up an online fundraising page to raise money for the Thames Valley Air Ambulance.
It has raised more than Â£30,000 so far.
The Crown Prosecution Service said it will not pursue a prosecution over the accidental death.
