[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Scotland Sevens were beaten 15-5 by South Africa in the final of the Paris leg, as the Blitzbokke clinched the World Series title.

Calum MacRae's team went down to tries from Werner Kok, Dylan Sage and captain Philip Snyman at Stade Jean Bouin.
The Scots had beaten South Africa in their opening fixture, going on to top Pool A with wins over Japan and Canada.
They saw off defending series champions Fiji and England in the quarter and semi-finals on Sunday.
That meant Scotland, who have only won one series leg - the London event last year - in their history, had beaten the three highest-ranked sides in world sevens en route to the showpiece.
But despite Scott Wight's second-half touchdown, a power-laden South African team prevailed to seal the series for the first time since 2009.
