An education and learning centre will be also built beside the structure with Â£50m promised for the project.
Sir Peter Bazalgette, chairman of the UK Holocaust Memorial Foundation, said it showed "we are doing the right thing for Britain's Holocaust survivors".
Chief Rabbi Ephraim Mirvis said it would "send the strongest possible message... that the lessons of the Holocaust will forever form a part of our national consciousness".
