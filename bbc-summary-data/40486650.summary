[SN]TITLE[SN]
Jamie Acton: Leigh Centurions forward's disciplinary case adjourned

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Jamie Acton's disciplinary case has been put back until 11 July, after his club Leigh Centurions requested more time to prepare for the hearing.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The forward, 25, has been charged with a Grade F offence of "other contrary behaviour", which carries a minimum ban of eight games if he is found guilty.
The incident occurred in Saturday's Super League defeat by Catalans.
Acton appeared to grab the shirt of Greg Bird, lift him and push him back to the floor while he lay injured.
The request for a delay was granted, provided Acton does not feature for Leigh in Friday's Super League match at Warrington.
Grade F offences are the most serious on the Rugby Football League's disciplinary scale.
