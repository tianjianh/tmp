Doncaster Rovers 3-1 Leyton Orient

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A pair of penalties from Liam Mandeville helped Doncaster come from behind to beat manageress Leyton Orient at the Keepmoat Stadium.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Promotion-chasing Rovers were dominant from the start and hit the crossbar on three occasions through Tommy Rowe, Andy Butler and Mandeville.
But they found themselves behind after 19 minutes courtesy of Callum Kennedy's brilliant 35-yard free-kick that slammed into the top corner.
Though they pushed almost constantly, it took Rovers until the stroke of half-time to draw level when Chelsea loanee Jordan Houghton slammed in from the edge of the box.
Doncaster took the lead after 59 minutes when Orient substitute Josh Koroma hacked down the on-rushing Matty Blair and Mandeville converted the penalty with confidence.
The third goal also came from the spot seven minutes later. Tommy Rowe was clipped in the box by Tom Parkes as he twisted and turned, with Mandeville slotting in again to give Doncaster the cushion they deserved in a one-sided game.
Rovers keeper Marko Marosi showed excellent reactions on his line to keep out Paul McCallum's header but there was no way back for Orient, who sacked manager Alberto Cavasin on Wednesday.
