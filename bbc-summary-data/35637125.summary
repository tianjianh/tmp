The Tykes went ahead inside the opening 10 minutes when Roberts converted Conor Hourihane's corner.
Fletcher doubled the lead following another Hourihane set-piece, smashing home after an error from Coventry goalkeeper Reice Charles-Cook.
Barnsley are now seventh in the table, level on points with Coventry in sixth.
Having endured a run of nine successive league defeats earlier this season, the Tykes have lost just once in their last 12 matches.
Coventry have now lost two on the spin going into this Saturday's home game with Rochdale, when Barnsley will be at fourth-placed Walsall.
Sky Blues boss Tony Mowbray told BBC Coventry & Warwickshire:
"We needed the players to turn up and not enough of them did. My standards are high and they did not do enough all night long.
"Barnsley are a powerful side. Their two centre backs were colossus tonight. They played like men.
"Everyone is down on confidence. The players have been great all season but we need them to get back to the high levels they have shown."
