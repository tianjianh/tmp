TUC backs day of action over Trade Union Bill

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Delegates at the TUC have voted for a "day of action" to oppose the government's proposed tightening of laws covering strikes.

There were warnings the Trade Union Bill - which passed its first Commons test despite Labour opposition on Monday - was a "declaration of war".
The government says the changes would protect the public from disruptive action, and had most people's backing.
Unions agreed to oppose the legislation "every inch of the way".
They also backed rail union RMT's motion for the TUC to consider "assisting in organising generalised strike action" in the event of legal action under the new bill being taken against trade unions.
TUC General Secretary Frances O'Grady, speaking at the TUC conference in Brighton, warned delegates that she had reservations about the phrase "generalised strike action", saying it was open to "ambiguous interpretation".

Under current rules, strikes can be called if the majority of those taking part in a ballot vote in favour.
The bill, which would apply to unions in England, Wales and Scotland, will also:
