[SN]TITLE[SN]
Sheffield United 1-1 Rochdale

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Sheffield United and Rochdale are still searching for their first wins of the League One season after drawing 1-1 at Bramall Lane.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Keith Hill's side looked to be heading for only their second ever win over United when Andy Cannon fired them in front but the hosts' captain Billy Sharp equalised during the closing stages of the first half.
Cannon pounced during the closing stages of a scrappy first-half, George Long saved Ian Henderson's 44th-minute shot but the midfielder steadied himself and shot home.
Mark Duffy had earlier gone close for United while Donal McDermott enjoyed several sights of goal at the opposite end of the pitch. But, for the most part, it was pretty tame from both teams.
Leon Clarke was inches away from drawing United level in the 65th minute after overpowering his marker to meet Duffy's cross but the ball fell just wide.
With eight minutes left, Sharp equalised, as the striker swept home a first-time finish from close range after meeting Chris Hussey's free-kick.
