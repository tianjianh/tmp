The executive has not yet decided to spend £1.3m of additional funding for flooding on preventative measures, the environment minister has said.

Mark H Durkan said he is hoping some of the money will go on a scheme to help those affected by floods.
It was reported on Monday that Stormont ministers had agreed to spend the money on prevention.
However, Mr Durkan said a sub-group had been set up and no final decision had been taken.
He described the formation of a sub-group as "completely unsatisfactory".
"I was on this show this time last week calling for an urgent executive meeting," he told Good Morning Ulster.
"That next executive meeting hadn't been scheduled until 21 January, now a meeting is scheduled for tomorrow (13 January).
"Now, to me, that's not really an urgent response. It took six days to get that done and all that, in effect, was done was the establishment of this group."
He added that while he "accepted" there as a need to do more on preventative measures against flooding, he would be proposing to get "some of that money in order to extend my (emergency flooding assistance) scheme".
"This isn't about my bidding, or other departments bidding, for this money," he added. "I genuinely don't care what department gets it.
"All I care about is that the people on the ground get it."
On Monday, Agriculture Minister Michelle O'Neill told Stormont that 30 properties along Lough Neagh had been flooded in recent storms.
She said that the water level of Lough Neagh was beginning to fall but that agencies remained on "high alert".
Last week, businesses on the shores of Lough Neagh were badly damaged by floods.
