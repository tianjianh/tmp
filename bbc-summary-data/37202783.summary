[SN]TITLE[SN]
York City 4-0 Solihull Moors

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Aidan Connolly scored an impressive brace as York bounced back from last week's defeat to Wrexham with an emphatic 4-0 victory over National League opponents Solihull at Bootham Crescent.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Minstermen opened the scoring in the ninth minute when Richard Brodie directed his header home from Connolly's corner.
But they had to wait until the 84th minute to double their lead, Connolly drilling an effort into the far corner.
Scott Fenwick added a third in the 89th minute, converting Kaine Felix's cross from the right, and there was still time for Connolly to score his second of the day after rounding the goalkeeper.
