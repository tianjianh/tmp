Fulham 1-1 Sheffield Wednesday

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Scott Malone scored a dramatic late equaliser as Fulham earned a point against Sheffield Wednesday.

Fernando Forestieri fired in from 20 yards after playing a one-two with Barry Bannan to put the Owls ahead.
Kevin McDonald headed a corner powerfully over the bar for Fulham, while both Gary Hooper and Forestieri had chances to make it 2-0.
Fulham turned up the pressure and equalised when Malone slammed home at the back post in the 91st minute.
Carlos Carvalhal's Wednesday side had lost their previous two Championship matches but started brightly against their in-form opponents, who had beaten Huddersfield and Brentford in their previous two games.
The visitors took the lead after 10 minutes when Forestieri's powerful shot beat Whites goalkeeper David Button and they could have been further ahead had Hooper not spurned a one-on-one and the ever-lively Forestieri hit the target minutes later.
The Italian striker dragged another attempt across goal in the second half before Tom Cairney mustered the home side's first shot on target in the 77th minute.
However, Fulham dominated the closing stages and were finally rewarded when left-back Malone arrived late into the box to smash in a goal which kept Slavisa Jokanovic's side in eighth, one place above Wednesday.
Fulham manager Slavisa Jokanovic: "It was a fair result, we played very well and I'm really satisfied with some parts of the game.
"We did not surrender in any moment. They played the better football and closer to three points. If we had played this game last year we would have lost 3-0.
"We did not offer our best performance but it was a small step where we are learning to compete."
Sheffield Wednesday manager Carlos Carvalhal: "We performed very well. Their team are in good shape, had won the last game 5-0 here and were in good momentum.
"We scored one goal and probably should have killed the game. We are not happy with the scoreline, we deserved more; we felt we achieved one point but lost two.
"I'm very happy with the team and the personality we showed. The Fulham fans will realise just how tough a team Sheffield Wednesday are."
