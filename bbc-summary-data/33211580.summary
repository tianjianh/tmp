England v New Zealand: Jonny Bairstow guides hosts to series win

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
England chased down a revised target of 192 from 26 overs to beat New Zealand by three wickets and win the five-game one-day international series.

The Kiwis posted a total of 283-9 from their 50 overs, with Martin Guptill and Kane Williamson making half-centuries.
Rain in the interval restricted England's innings, and they quickly stumbled to 45-5.
But Jonny Bairstow's unbeaten 83 led the hosts to a victory over the World Cup runners-up with an over to spare.
The sides now meet again on Tuesday in a Twenty20 international at Old Trafford, which is England's final outing before the first Ashes Test in Cardiff on 8 July.
But before England turn their attentions to Australia, they can look back at a remarkable transformation in their one-day fortunes, after a disastrous period which culminated in their failure to get out of the group stages at World Cup just three months ago.
This game, which sealed a first home ODI series win for England since 2012, lacked the explosiveness, and runs, of the previous four in the series, but was not short on drama as England at one stage needed 54 off 35 balls with three wickets remaining.
Captain Eoin Morgan has tried to epitomise a new, attacking mentality for England, but his first-ball duck, finding the hands of Guptill with an attempted slog, summed up his side's struggles early on in their innings to chase down a target formulated by the Duckworth-Lewis method.
There was also a memorable moment for New Zealand debutant Andrew Mathieson, who has played just 19 first-class matches and has been representing Sidmouth in the Devon League, when he had Jason Roy caught with his first ball in international cricket.
But it took an 80-run sixth-wicket stand from Sam Billings, who contributed 41 from 40 balls, and Bairstow to spark England into life.
Bairstow, only in the side because of a hand injury to Jos Buttler, was in a destructive mood, crashing 11 fours on his way to a first one-day international half-century. He received support from Yorkshire team-mate Adil Rashid, who scored 12, to get over the line.
However, it was Rashid's bowling earlier in the day that may have piqued the interest of England's selectors ahead of the Ashes.
The 27-year-old took two wickets, and went for just 4.50 an over, in a disciplined display of leg-spin bowling.
Things had looked ominous for the Kiwis when captain Brendon McCullum, one ball after hitting a six, played Steven Finn on to his stumps.
And while Guptill and Williamson staged a recovery, before Ben Wheeler led a late charge with 39 from 28 balls, England's bowlers were patient and effective, with Ben Stokes finishing with admirable figures of of 3-52.
