[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Derry City needed a fortunate penalty award to force a replay against First Division side Drogheda United in the FAI Cup on Friday night.

Drogheda took the lead through Sam O'Connor on the 33rd minute after Derry had dominated the early exchanges.
Derry's Rory Patterson saw a penalty saved but the Candystripes got another spot-kick 17 minutes from time.
It looked a harsh decision against keeper Stephen McGuinness who was unable to stop Aaron McEneff's penalty.
The replay is at United Park on Tuesday night.
Derry will feel they had enough chances to win the game on the night, but it was the Drogheda management who were protesting to referee Paul Tuite after the match.
The key decision came in the 73rd minute when experienced official Tuite ruled that keeper McGuinness had fouled Derry debutant Lukas Schubert.
It seemed McGuinness had got the ball before the Austrian, pushing the ball behind for a corner.
But a penalty was given and, with Patterson having failed form the spot earlier, McEneff stepped up to score his first goal for the Candstripes.
The first penalty was in the 57th minute after Josh Daniels had been tripped just inside the box by Kenneth Costello, but striker Patterson saw his casually-taken effort saved by McGuinness.
Early in the second half McEneff hit the crossbar twice while Schubert saw an effort strike the post as Derry pressed for a late winner.
