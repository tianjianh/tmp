Clayton, who was first seed for the tournament in Nottingham, came from a set down to beat unseeded Joshua Sapwell 3-6, 6-4, 6-3 in the final.
"Was a great week and was happy to go out of junior tennis with a bang," he said on Twitter.
The win comes just weeks after Clayton helped Great Britain to eighth place in the Under-18 European Summer Cup.
