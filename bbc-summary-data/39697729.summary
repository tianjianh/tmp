Ehiogu, 44, collapsed at Tottenham's training centre on Thursday, where he was working as their under-23s coach, after suffering a cardiac arrest.
Gemma Ehiogu said money was being raised to help set up a charity that would give all children the opportunity to play football.
Over £11,000 has been raised so far.
Mrs Ehiogu started up a page on JustGiving on Saturday with an original target of £1,000 to establish a charity in her husband's name.
On the fundraising page she said: "Ugo's dream was to set up a charity that gives every child equal opportunity to access and play football. He had already put the wheels in motion.
"This fund will make his dream become a reality. We don't have a set target every donation will help. Thank you, In memory of Ugo Ehiogu #DoSomethingKind."
By 18:00 BST on Monday the target had been surpassed, with £11,150 in donations.
A final tweet from Ehiogu went viral, after the news of his passing, with people from across the world promoting #dosomethingkind
The hashtag was trending in Great Britain and the US after Ehiogu used it on 29 March to describe donating £10 to a homeless girl.
