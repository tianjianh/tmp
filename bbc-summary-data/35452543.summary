A 14th successive Serie A win kept the champions two points behind leaders Napoli, who they play next week.
On-loan Chelsea winger Cuadrado drove home his third goal of the season after 74 minutes before top scorer Dybala secured the points in the final minute.
Dybala, who also hit a post, curled in his 16th goal of the season.
Napoli maintained their title challenge with an eighth successive league win as they secured a narrow 1-0 home victory over 10-man Carpi.
The leaders needed a 69th-minute penalty from Gonzalo Higuain to beat the relegation-threatened visitors, who had Raffaele Bianco sent off for a second booking 12 minutes into the second half.
Higuain, the leading scorer in Serie A, claimed his 26th goal of the season after Kalidou Koulibaly had been fouled by Fabio Daprela following a corner.
Elsewhere, fourth-placed Inter Milan fought back from 3-1 down but could only draw 3-3 at bottom club Verona as their stuttering run continued.
AC Milan extended their unbeaten run to eight games but were held to a 1-1 draw at home by Udinese, while Sassuolo and Palermo drew 2-2.
Chievo came from 1-0 down to win 2-1 at Torino.
