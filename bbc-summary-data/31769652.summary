West Midlands Ambulance worker Jason Southall had denied a charge of racially aggravated harassment.
However, he was found guilty at South Sefton Magistrates' Court earlier.
Southall, 44, of Coppice Road, Walsall, was also ordered to pay ??850, which police said took place during an away match against Liverpool.
West Midlands Ambulance Service said Mr Southall has resigned from his job with immediate effect.
Merseyside Police said the incident happened on 13 September during Liverpool's game versus Aston Villa at Anfield.
They said the German officer was attending the game with Merseyside officers as part of a course development.
Det Ch Insp Andy O'Connor said: "This was a despicable crime against a police officer visiting this city who was simply trying to go about her job and develop her skills"
He commended Liverpool's stewards for their work.
