The toilets at Staffin on Skye were among a number of Highland Council-run sites shut this year to save money.
The council has been in talks with Staffin Community Trust about alternative facilities.
In the meantime, two complaints have been received public urination and defecation in and around the village.
The nearest public toilet is in Kilmuir about 11 miles (17km) from Staffin.
Residents have told BBC Alba of people using ditches, a nearby quarry and the rear of the closed toilet block.
Highland Council it had cost Â£6,700 a year to run Staffin's loos.
A spokeswoman said: "We cannot confirm that people have been urinating and defecating in the area - we have found no evidence to support these claims.
"There have been two complaints made, one to environmental health and one to roads and community works.
"In addition to this we have had three enquiries about Staffin toilets."
She added: "The council has been in discussions with Staffin Community Trust and have agreed in principle to operate a seasonal - April to October - Highland Comfort Scheme within the community hall."
