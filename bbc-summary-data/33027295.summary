It is the aircraft's first public appearance since the Vulcan to the Sky Trust, which owns it, confirmed this is its last flying season.
The Vulcan XH558 will be at Throckmorton Air Show on Saturday, for the first and last time.
The plane originally arrived at RAF Waddington in 1960 and was the last Vulcan to leave RAF service.
It retired from service in 1993 and is the only one left of the 134 that were built for the Royal Air Force.
The trust said it raised more than Â£2m each year to service and operate the aircraft, which is based at the former RAF Finningley, now Robin Hood Airport Doncaster Sheffield.
But now engineering backers, including Rolls-Royce, have withdrawn support and the plane is beyond its flying hours.
"Having evaluated a great many factors, the three expert companies on whom XH558 depends - known as the 'technical authorities' - have together decided to cease their support at the end of this flying season. Without that support, under Civil Aviation Authority regulations, she is not permitted to fly," the trust said.
A farewell tour around the UK is planned for later this month.
Dr Robert Pleming, from the trust, said "If you don't see her this season, there will be no more opportunities to hear a Vulcan's spine-tingling howl as she climbs high into the sky for another dramatic display, or to see her rolling onto her side to reveal her giant delta silhouette."
