[SN]TITLE[SN]
Bournemouth Spur Road-rebuild backed with £66m funding

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
One of Dorset's busiest roads is to be rebuilt following a successful bid for £66m of government funding.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The reconstruction of a 5.5 mile (8km) stretch of the A338 Bournemouth Spur Road is of one of five schemes to get the green light.
The road carries about 60,000 vehicles a day, more than 2,000 of which are HGVs.
Peter Finney, Dorset County Council cabinet member, said it would be a "lifeline for business development".
The work between Ashley Heath Roundabout and the Blackwater Junction is one of five schemes aimed at increasing road capacity and easing congestion on the road network around Bournemouth and its airport.
The funding follows an application to central government's Local Growth Fund by Dorset Local Enterprise Partnership (DLEP), made up of councils and business bodies.
A previous bid for £20m funding for repair works on the A338 was turned down by the government in 2011.
Bournemouth Chamber of Trade previously described the current dual carriageway as "20 years past its safe use-by date".
Work on the A338 is due to start in September 2015.
