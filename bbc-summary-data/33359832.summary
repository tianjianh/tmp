[SN]TITLE[SN]
Gloucestershire and Wiltshire schools abuse inquiry widens

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Further claims of historical abuse at three schools in Gloucestershire and Wiltshire have been made.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Pupils said they were subjected to "horrific" abuse at Badgeworth Court, Dowdeswell and Clouds House in the 1970s and 1980s.
Det Ch Insp Steve Porter, from Gloucestershire Police, said "tens of victims" had since come forward.
Staff who worked at the schools have "categorically denied" any involvement in abusing pupils.
Det Ch Insp Porter said the force was treating "these new allegations seriously" and it would "robustly investigate" them.
"We will treat them with sympathy and compassion and have a victim-centred approach in how we deal with them," he added.
He added allegations of cruelty had also been made.
The former owner of the schools Anthony Hurley, appeared in court in 2000 on allegations of cruelty and sexual abuse of children, but was deemed unfit to stand trial.
He then died in 2003.
The investigation is being led by officers from the force's major crime team.
