Jack Adcock death: Doctor refused right to appeal

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A doctor who was convicted of the manslaughter by gross negligence of a six-year-old boy has failed in her bid for an appeal.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Hadiza Bawa-Garba, 40, was convicted of Jack Adcock's manslaughter at Nottingham Crown Court last November.
Jack, who had a heart condition, died at Leicester Royal Infirmary in 2011 hours after being admitted with sickness and vomiting.
She was seeking the right to appeal against her conviction.

The doctor was given a two-year sentence, suspended for two years.
Counsel for Bawa-Garba argued before three senior judges in London that her trial was unfair because the judge misdirected the jury.
But Sir Brian Leveson ruled: "We have come to clear conclusion that none of the grounds of appeal are, in fact, arguable".
He ruled the trial judge's directions to the jury could not be faulted and refused permission for a full appeal.
Jack's parents, Nicky and Vic, who live in Glen Parva, Leicester, were not in court to hear the decision.
