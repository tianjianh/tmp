The former back-row forward, who was capped 71 times by England and represented the British and Irish Lions, will start his post next week.
Jones and Hill previously worked together when the Australian was director of rugby at Saracens.
"Richard is an icon of English rugby," said Jones. "I am in no doubt that Richard will excel in his role."
Since retiring through injury in 2008, the 43-year-old has worked for his former club Saracens and the Rugby Football Union. Most recently, he was team manager on the England Saxons tour of South Africa in the summer.
Jones added: "Richard's responsibilities will range from maintaining England Rugby's internal and external relationships to providing mentoring and support for players and management.
"It is important we use the knowledge of former international players and keep a historical link with the past."
"This is not a manager role like in football - Hill is unlikely to have a hands-on coaching or selection role, but will still be an integral part of the set-up and will act as a sounding board for England players and management.
"Eddie Jones is keen to forge strong links with past international players, and World Cup winner Hill is one of England's all-time greats."
