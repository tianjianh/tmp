[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Kostadin Kostov, 42, is accused of murdering 38-year-old Gergana Prodanova, who was last seen in Exeter.
She was reported missing on 8 August by work colleagues when she failed to turn up for work.
Kostov is due to appear at Exeter Magistrates Court on Monday. Police said inquiries were ongoing and extensive searches were continuing in the Mount Pleasant area of Exeter.
Devon and Cornwall Police said following the disappearance and the subsequent launch of a murder investigation a team of search officers are continuing their efforts to trace Gergana Prodanova.
The force said around 30 officers are conducting house-to-house enquiries, as well as using the police helicopter, drone, and support from specially trained dogs.
Officers said around 2,000 properties in the Mount Pleasant area of Exeter have been visited by police.
Det Supt Paul Burgan said: "Her family in Bulgaria need to know what has happened to her, especially her three children.
"While we have a huge team searching for Gergana we also need the public to help and this is a plea for our community to search their outbuildings for any sign of Gergana."
