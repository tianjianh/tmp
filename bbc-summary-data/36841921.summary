Mr Clegg stood down as Lib Dem leader after the party lost 49 out of its 57 MPs at the 2015 general election.
He said he wanted to ensure ministers were "subject to the scrutiny and accountability which voters deserve"  following the vote to leave the EU.
The ex-MEP said there was "no exit plan from the government" or "meaningful opposition" from Labour.
Mr Clegg, who campaigned alongside leading figures for Remain before the referendum, said: "Theresa May says Brexit means Brexit, but no one actually knows what that means.
"Will we be in the single market or cut off from it, with all the implications that has for British jobs and our economy?
"What does it mean for immigration? What about the Brits who live abroad and the Europeans who have made our country their home? How will we co-operate with our neighbours to tackle terrorism, cross-border crime and climate change?"
Lib Dem leader Tim Farron said "no one is better placed" than his predecessor to challenge the government over Brexit as the Sheffield Hallam MP was in the cabinet with some of the key players in the current government during the coalition years.
