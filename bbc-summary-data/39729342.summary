A project that cares for the elderly in a Pembrokeshire village has secured funding to keep it going for two years.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Solva Care, which launched as a two-year pilot in October 2015, helps about 40 elderly people in the community.
The not-for-profit initiative matches people who need support to 30 volunteers who provide it.
A grant of Â£21,421 was awarded by Pembrokeshire Coast National Park Authority's Sustainable Development Fund.
Solva Care's project leader Mollie Roach said the money, together with Welsh Government funding, will keep it going for another two years.
She said: "This is very good news. We know that Solva Care works and is making a real difference to people's lives."
