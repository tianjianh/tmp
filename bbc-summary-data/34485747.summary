Stepping Hill Hospital killer Victorino Chua struck off nursing register

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Killer nurse Victorino Chua, who is serving life for murdering and poisoning patients, has been struck off the nursing register.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Chua was given 25 life terms and told he must serve a minimum of 35 years in jail, after being convicted in May.
His crimes were carried out at Stepping Hill Hospital, Stockport.
Speaking to the nursing panel by telephone from Wakefield Prison, he continued to claim he was innocent of the crimes.
He was formally struck off after the Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC) panel said it was "difficult to imagine more serious convictions" which were "fundamentally incompatible" with him continuing as a registered nurse.
Chua, 49, told the hearing he "loved his work". He is planning to appeal against his criminal convictions.
At his trial, it was revealed police found a letter written by Chua who said he was "an angel turned into an evil person" adding, "there's a devil in me".
Panel chairman William Ard said "You murdered two patients and caused significant harm to a number of others."
He told Chua he had shown no "insight or remorse" and "repeatedly abused" his position as a nurse.
Mr Ard said he caused "catastrophic harm" to other vulnerable patients.
"Your actions have rightly been described as cunning, wicked, evil and sinister," he said.
The four-month trial was told he secretly injected insulin into saline bags and ampoules which were then unwittingly used by other nurses.
The Nursing and Midwifery Council said it was aware Chua was serving two concurrent life sentences but added the court process does not have jurisdiction over its role as the regulatory body for midwives and nurses.
