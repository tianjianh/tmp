[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Adams was part of a Widnes side in the 1970s and 1980s that were known as 'Cup Kings', appearing in eight Challenge Cup final ties including replays.
He was part of four Wembley triumphs, and scored 68 tries in more than 400 appearances - culminating in 1992's addition to the Chemics' Hall of Fame.
The back-rower, who passed away on Thursday, also represented Great Britain and England during his career.
"The club would like to pass on their sincere condolences to Mick's family and friends at this time," a statement said.
Widnes will hold a minute's applause for Adams before Sunday's Super League fixture against Castleford.
