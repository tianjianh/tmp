The Cod Army, who are two points above the drop zone following the loss, came close to opening the scoring when Bobby Grant's acrobatic volley hit the bar.
But Steve Morison's delicate chip over Fleetwood keeper Chris Maxwell gave the Lions a lead they did not surrender.
Neil Harris' side are fourth and are three points clear of seventh-placed Barnsley with three games left to play.
Millwall manager Neil Harris told BBC Radio London:

"We were nowhere near at our best, that's for sure.
"I think it's probably one that maybe we've been owed during the season that we've lost games or drawn games we should have won and today was maybe the other way round, maybe we didn't deserve the three points.
"If you're looking at the difference between the two teams I think you're looking at the quality of the winning goal."
