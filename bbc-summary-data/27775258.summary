[SN]TITLE[SN]
Men jailed for EDL bomb plot fail with appeal

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Six men jailed for planning to bomb an English Defence League rally have lost their appeal against their sentences.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Court of Appeal rejected the claim that they were handed harsher sentences than similar non-Muslim offenders.
The men are Omar Khan, Jewel Uddin, Zohaib Ahmed, Mohammed Hasseen, Anzal Hussain and Mohammed Saud
They were sentenced in June last year and jailed for between 18 and 20 years for plans related to the June 2012 rally, in Dewsbury, West Yorkshire.
Lawyers for the six men were expected to argue that the sentences they received at the Old Bailey were discriminatory by breaching Article 14 of the European Convention on Human Rights - which prohibits discrimination on grounds of religion - and by being contrary to common law.
They were set to claim that comparisons with prison terms given to non-Muslims found guilty of similar offences shows a persistent pattern of much lower sentences.
Five of the West Midlands men had taken a bomb, knives and sawn off shotguns to the rally but their plot was foiled because they arrived two hours after it ended.
They were caught by chance after a car used by two of them and carrying weapons was stopped by police on the M1 after the rally and found to have no insurance.
Khan, Uddin and Ahmed were sentenced to 19-and-a-half years in prison.
Hasseen, Hussain and Saud were given 18 years and nine months.
All of the men received an extra five-year extension to their terms "on licence".
These were what are known as "extended sentences", which means that the men will serve at least two thirds of their principal sentence in prison.
Once they are released, they remain on licence for the remainder of their prison sentence, and for the licence period.
