[SN]TITLE[SN]
Borussia Dortmund 1-0 Bayern Munich

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang's first-half strike gave Borussia Dortmund victory over Bayern Munich in Der Klassiker.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Aubameyang guided Mario Gotze's low cross past Bayern keeper Manuel Neuer to hand Dortmund an 11th-minute lead.
Frank Ribery backheeled the ball into the net in the second half but it was flagged for offside while Robert Lewandowski headed wide late on.
Bayern's first domestic defeat of the season leaves them three points behind Bundesliga leaders RB Leipzig.
Dortmund's victory was also their first at home against Bayern in the Bundesliga since April 2012, and it saw them close the gap on their rivals to three points as they climbed up to third spot.
Thomas Tuchal's side were the dominant team in the first half and Aubameyang's goal gave them a deserved advantage at the break.
Bayern were much improved in the second half as they monopolised possession and went close when Xabi Alonso struck the crossbar with a curling effort.
Aubameyang's finishing let him down him when he broke clear only to shoot straight at Neuer.
Despite a heavy spell of late Bayern pressure, Dortmund held on.
