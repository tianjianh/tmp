Aberdeen bypass: Tunnel suggested as alternative

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Building a tunnel from the south of Aberdeen would be less disruptive and more effective than the planned bypass, it has been claimed.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Deputy leader of Aberdeen City Council, Marie Boulton, an Independent, has written to the transport secretary outlining plans for the link.
It would run underground from the A90 Aberdeen to Stonehaven road into the Lang Stracht and Hazlehead area.
Opposition councillors have dismissed the idea.
Ms Boulton said it could solve many problems, with one of the advantages being no snow clearing.
The 28-mile Aberdeen bypass was given the green light by Scottish ministers in 2009, but was delayed by legal action.
Previously predicted to cost Â£347m, that has risen to more than Â£650m.
It is expected to be completed in 2018.
