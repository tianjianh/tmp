[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Songwriter Edwyn Collins is to attend a free screening of his new film in Helmsdale in Sutherland.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
His wife Grace Maxwell whispered the name of the village to him when he was in a coma after suffering a stroke and two haemorrhages in 2005.
Generations of Collins' family have had a home in Helmsdale and the musician spent childhood holidays there.
The screening of The Possibilities Are Endless will be held at the Timespan museum on 11 November.
Museum staff said Collins and Maxwell wanted the showing to be a "thank you" to the people of Helmsdale and the surrounding area.
A second screening is planned for December.
Edinburgh-born Collins is known for his work with the band Orange Juice and his 1995 solo hit A Girl Like You.
Made by Pulse Films, the lyricist's new film opens in Helmsdale and explores the singer-songwriter's journey from the brink of death to rediscovering memories lost after experiencing the stroke.
During his coma, Collins' wife would whisper the word "Helmsdale" to him and promise that the couple would return to the Highland village on Sutherland's east coast.
After waking from his coma, the first two phrases he was able to say were "Grace Maxwell" and "the possibilities are endless".
The film is also being screened during the Inverness Film Festival at Eden Court.
