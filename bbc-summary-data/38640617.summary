[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Ireland hooker Sean Cronin is expected to miss the Six Nations Championship because of a hamstring injury.

Cronin's club Leinster said on Monday that the 30-year-old had sustained a high-grade tear which could rule him out for 10 weeks.
The injury, sustained in Leinster's recent Pro12 win over Zebre, was initially thought to be a minor strain.
The news is a blow to Ireland as Cronin was the main cover for skipper Rory Best at hooker.
Ireland's first Six Nations match is away to Scotland on Saturday, 4 February.
"It's quite a significant hamstring injury," said Leinster coach Stuart Lancaster.
"He went to push-off and accelerate around the corner and saw it go. He is deeply disappointed but he will be back a better player."
