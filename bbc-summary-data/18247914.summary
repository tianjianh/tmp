A Wolverhampton man has been given an 18-month gang injunction, thought to be the first issued in the West Midlands.

Reuben Hudson, 29, from the Heath Town Crew, is banned from the Pendeford, Whitmore Reans and Heath Town areas as well as Wolverhampton city centre.
He was also moved away from the city as part of an interim decision in March.
The injunctions were introduced by the Home Office in January 2011 to try to break gang culture.
Conceived by the previous Labour government and sometimes referred to as "gang Asbos", the injunctions are designed to prevent members from meeting up and to reduce gang-related violence and crime.
West Midlands Police said the injunction issued at Birmingham County Court also required Mr Hudson to work with mentors.
It is thought to be the first time that requirement has been applied as part of the new injunctions.
The mentors are expected to work with Mr Hudson to develop skills and encourage him to stop gang activity.
Supt Mark Payne said: "Our priority is to protect the community and at the same time support gang members to exit a lifestyle which has a corrosive impact upon communities.
"We continue to work very closely with people in our local communities and our local partners to seek to address the underlying issues.
"We are under no illusion that gang tensions remain between gangs in the city and we continue to make every effort to reduce these tensions."
The injunction is due to be reviewed in March, but Mr Hudson could face a jail term earlier if it is breached.
Karen Samuels, Head of the Community Safety Partnership at Wolverhampton City Council, said it would "pave the way" for similar action against other people associated to gangs in the area.
In April last year armed police patrolled the streets of the city after a series of murders and shootings, believed to be gang-related.
