The 23-year-old arrived at Stangmore Park and helped the Swifts climb clear of relegation danger and finish in seventh place in the Irish Premiership.
The central defender had been at Linfield since May 2014.
"Dungannon are my club and I wanted to do well for them when I came here on loan," Hegarty told the club's website.
"I felt we were in a false position in the table.
"I wanted to get us to where we should be and I think I helped do that."
Meanwhile, Dungannon have announced that striker Gary Liggett has not been offered a new contract by Head Coach Rodney McAree.
