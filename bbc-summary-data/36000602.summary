Married Tony and Julie Wadsworth have presented on BBC Radio Leicester and BBC WM in Birmingham.
The couple from Leicestershire are due to appear at Warwickshire Magistrates' Court on Wednesday 11 May.
A BBC spokesman said: "We understand the charges do not relate to their conduct or position at the BBC." He said both presenters remain off air.
Mr and Mrs Wadsworth are accused of offences against boys aged 11 to 15 that are alleged to have taken place in Atherstone, Warwickshire, between 1996 and 1999.
Mr Wadsworth, 68, of Old Mill Road, Broughton Astley, has been charged with five counts of inciting a boy under the age of 16 to commit an act of gross indecency.
His wife, 58, whose on-air name was Julie Mayer, has been charged with seven counts of inciting a boy under the age of 16 to commit an act of gross indecency.
They both also face one count of committing an act outraging public decency.
