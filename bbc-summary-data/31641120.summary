He will be the voice of Ryan on a Thomas and Friends DVD titled Sodor's Legend Of The Lost Treasure.
The star said he "jumped at the opportunity" to be part of the recording, having grown up with Thomas.
The announcement comes days after he picked up the Oscar for best actor for his role as Professor Stephen Hawking in The Theory of Everything.
He said: "I grew up loving to watch Thomas and his pals getting caught up in unexpected and mischievous adventures.
"I jumped at the opportunity to get involved and what fun it was. I have never voiced an animated character before, and I had a complete blast."
The film will also feature the voices of John Hurt and Jamie Campbell Bower.
