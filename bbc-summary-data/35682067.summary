As was the case in Saturday's opener, the Northern Irishman and Welsh rider duelled on the final lap but on Sunday Davies came off after running wide.
That left Rea, 29, to finish 0.83 seconds ahead of Dutchman Michael van der Mark with Davide Giugliano third.
Davies, 29, remounted his bike to cross the line in 10th spot.
Rea pipped Ducati rider Davies by 0.063 seconds in Saturday's season-opener in Phillip Island with Van der Mark taking third.
The Northern Irishman is aiming to emulate the achievement of Carl Fogarty, who successfully defended his title twice in the 1990s.
Rea won 14 of the 26 races last year and was on the podium 23 times.
The defending champion's Kawasaki team-mate Tom Sykes led for almost half the race before a mistake dropped him back to fourth.
Dutchman Van der Mark then led for seven laps before Davies edged into the lead prior to his final-lap mishap.
Nicky Hayden, the 2006 MotoGP champion, took fourth with Sylvain Guintoli and Britain's Tom Sykes completing the top six.
Rea was delighted to complete his weekend double which emphasised that he is likely to be the rider to beat again this season.
"It's incredible to start my year here with the double," the Northern Irishman said.
Rea's opening double victory gives him a 14-point lead over Van der Mark heading into the second round in Thailand in two weeks.
