Speaking to Australian radio station Undercover FM she said: "I haven't done anything I wanted to."
She admitted she'd yet to achieve her goal of being "one of the best artists of her generation," adding that she was angry that she's "not bigger".
The Welsh singer, who was second on BBC's Sound of 2010 list, also said her US label hadn't backed her in America.
"The label haven't really promoted me I'm afraid," she said in the interview. "It's very difficult."
"It's not really their fault," she added.
"The pop landscape in the US is so difficult to penetrate as you go into this dance-world now," she explained.
"Dance music was quite underground for a long time in America but now because of (Lady) Gaga and people like that it has been brought back," she continued.
"You need to be in that pumping beats area and I'm certainly not."
The singer released her debut album The Family Jewels last year.
Having cancelled a scheduled tour of the US this month she said she has now begun work on her forthcoming second album.
