[SN]TITLE[SN]
Inquiry call over alleged historical sex abuse at school

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
People who claim they were sexually abused by a Newport head teacher in the 1970s are calling for an inquiry to investigate if reports were made to the authorities at the time.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Seven people have contacted solicitors alleging they were assaulted by Jon Styler at Malpas Church in Wales Primary School.
Mr Styler, who killed himself in 2007, reportedly denied the allegations.
Gwent Police said it was not currently investigating Mr Styler.
Jeff Parry from Newport, who was a pupil at the school in the 1970s, claims he was abused during private reading lessons in Mr Styler's office, when he was 10-years-old.
He said he felt no-one would have believed him at the time, but now wants an investigation to find out what the authorities might have known.
"I would like there to be an inquiry now into what happened because I don't want it to happen to any other child," he said.
Another alleged victim, who did not want to be named, claims he was abused at school, at a holiday caravan and after trips to the theatre.
Other media reports suggest Jon Styler had been arrested and released on bail over historical allegations.
The same reports also claimed he strongly denied the allegations in a letter written before his death.
A signed statement from a senior teacher who worked at the school at the time, seen by BBC Wales, alleges he told a number of organisations about his concerns "young vulnerable children were at considerable risk".
They include the Church in Wales, a teaching union and the then Gwent County Council.
The teacher claims Mr Styler was spoken to but no pupils were questioned.
Mr Styler also worked at Brynglas Primary School, Newport, from 1968, before later moving to Malpas Church in Wales Primary School.
No allegations have been made against him at any other institution.
Newport council said it took the allegations seriously but it could not comment further as the matter was subject to a legal claim.
Malpas Church in Wales Junior School said any allegations "should be fully investigated" but said "nobody connected with the school at that time remains".
The Church in Wales said it had "no record on file of claims against Mr Styler", while Gwent Police said there was currently no investigation into Mr Styler.
