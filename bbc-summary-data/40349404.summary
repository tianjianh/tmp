Middlesex v Yorkshire: County champions beat Tykes for first win of 2017

County champions Middlesex ended their winless start to the year by beating 2016 title rivals Yorkshire by an innings and 64 runs at Lord's.

The Tykes added only 22 runs to their overnight score to end their first innings 208 all out, 238 runs behind.
Following on, Adam Lyth, Alex Lees and Harry Brook then all fell in the space of nine balls to leave Yorkshire 16-3.
The visitors, beaten by Middlesex on the final day last season, were 174 all out for their first loss since April.
Adil Rashid (35) and Steven Patterson (30 not out) were the only two batsmen to make 30 or more in an uncharacteristically poor Yorkshire display.
Five different Middlesex bowlers chipped in with second-innings wickets, with seamers Tim Murtagh and Toby Roland-Jones taking two each and spinner Ollie Rayner returning figures of 4-35.
Sam Robson's 159 and 111 from Paul Stirling on the opening day had set the platform for the hosts, who had won only two of their 13 previous games across all formats this season.
Middlesex captain James Franklin told BBC Radio London:
"We have bounced back strongly after getting a bit of a towelling from Lancashire at Southport last week. It was really important that we fronted up here. To beat Yorkshire inside three days is very satisfying.
"Our bowlers asked some serious questions of Yorkshire's batsmen and, when you got it in the right areas, it was a tough pitch to bat on as it deteriorated.
"Sam Robson and Paul Stirling batted brilliantly to set the match up for us on the first day with their hundreds, and we backed that up beautifully with the ball."
Yorkshire head coach Andrew Gale told BBC Radio Leeds:
"First day, bowling wise, we did quite well without a lot of reward. That was when the pitch was at its best. We got rewarded for that second morning.
"But, from then on we were well below par. From a batting point of view, we were well below par. We had a long chat and some strong words about the batting at Taunton (against Somerset) and some more strong words in this game.
"We expect a response. As well as we bowled, Middlesex were up for the challenge and were a lot more patient than us. To be bowled out twice like we have is poor."
