Edward Huxley, 70, of Cookham, Berkshire, had denied two counts of indecent assault in a trial at Mold Crown Court which began in April.
Four other men have already been convicted and another has been cleared. The jury has now retired for the day as it considers verdicts on a seventh man.
Boys were assaulted at sex parties, the trial was told.
Former police officer Huxley, 70, who at the time worked as a civil servant at Wrexham Barracks, has been convicted of charges of indecent assault on the main complainant.
The men were arrested as part of the Operation Pallial investigation into historical abuse across north Wales.
