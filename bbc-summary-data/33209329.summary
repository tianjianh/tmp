"Caucasian Heritage Night: Irish, Italian, Scandinavian, German --- or even Utahn! Whatever your background, celebrate it at the Home of the Owlz!" a calendar entry reads.
Other promotions included "Christmas in August" and "Throwback Night".
The team is associated with the Angels, a major league team in California.
"Our goal in this promotion, like any of our promotions, is to have fun and make fun of everyday normalcies," the team said.
"Our night was to include wonder bread on burgers with mayonnaise, clips from shows like Friends and Seinfeld and trying to solve the vertical leaping challenge.
"We understand, in light of recent tragic events, that our intentions have been misconstrued. For that, we sincerely apologise."
On Wednesday night, nine people were shot dead in an African-American church in South Carolina in what police termed a hate crime.
The Owlz are a rookie-league team - the most entry level division of the minor leagues. The league is designed for new players hone their skills.
On Friday, "Caucasian Heritage Night" quickly became a top trending term on Twitter in the US.
