[SN]TITLE[SN]
'No plans' to move nuclear weapons from Scotland

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The UK government does not intend to make alternative plans for the storage of the UK's nuclear weapons outside of Scotland, it has emerged.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Scottish government opposes the Trident missile system and the storing of nuclear weapons in the country.
On Monday, MPs will vote on whether or not to renew Trident, which is based at Faslane on the Clyde.
No contingency plans for moving Trident were put in place in the run up to the 2014 Scottish independence vote.
The Scottish government had pledged it would get rid of nuclear weapons if Scotland voted to leave the UK.
The MoD has said it was not anticipating another referendum and Faslane is the best place for the weapons to be based.
After the UK referendum vote to leave the EU, Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said a second independence referendum was now "highly likely".
And at David Cameron's final PMQs this week, SNP Westminster leader Angus Robertson said one of Theresa May's first tasks as the new prime minister would be to impose Trident "against the will of almost every single MP from Scotland".
Mr Cameron responded: "On Trident, there will be a vote in this house and it's right that this house should decide and many people in Scotland support our nuclear deterrent, maintaining it and the jobs that come to Scotland."
