Lara Clarke, an amateur baker from Brownhills, West Midlands, has joined a worldwide collaboration of bakers.
The group plans to post pictures of their cakes online in time for 31 July - the birthday of the author and her fictional creation Harry Potter.
Other cakes include the Weasley's flying car and the Hogwart's library.
Ms Clarke said the chocolate bust of Harry was life-sized.
The amateur baker whose previous creations include a Land Rover and Hollywood stars Johnny Depp and Jennifer Lawrence, said she met her fellow baking enthusiasts online.
