[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Billy Horschel claimed his fourth PGA Tour title by beating Jason Day in a play-off at the Byron Nelson event in Texas.

The American, 30, carded a one-under 69 to tie on 12 under after 72 holes with Australian world number three Day.
Both made par on the 17th before leaving birdie chances short on the 18th to set up the play-off.
But Horschel won his first tournament since 2014 after Day, 29, missed a four-foot putt for par on the 18th.
Horschel, who came into the tournament having missed four consecutive cuts, began the day a shot behind overnight leader John Hahn.
But American Hahn hit three consecutive bogeys on the back nine and eventually had to settle for third place on 11 under.
A birdie by Horschel on 16 helped set the stage for a play-off as both he and Day parred the final two holes.
Horschel then parred the first play-off hole as Day missed a short putt to extend the play-off, handing Horschel victory.
Day, whose mother is battling lung cancer, suffered a back injury last year and has only managed one top-10 finish on the tour this season.
Defending champion Sergio Garcia, who won the Masters last month, carded a final-round 74 to fade from contention.
