Martin, the star of films including 1983's The Man with Two Brains will receive his award in June next year.
Sir Howard Stringer, chair of the AFI's board of trustees, said: "He is a multi-layered creative force bound by neither convention nor caution."
Martin started his career as a stand-up comic before moving on to acting.
His other roles included Little Shop of Horrors in 1986, Dirty Rotten Scoundrels in 1988 with Sir Michael Caine and Planes, Trains and Automobiles with the late John Candy in 1987.
He also starred in the family comedy Parenthood in 1989 as well as Father of the Bride [parts one and two] in 1991 and 1995 with Diane Keaton. In 2005 he starred in Shopgirl with Claire Danes, and Jason Schwartzman, which was based on his novella of the same name.
"Steve Martin is an American original," Sir Howard added. "His work is defined by him alone, for he is the author - and a national treasure whose work has stuck with us like an arrow in the head. AFI is proud to present him with its 43rd Life Achievement Award."
During his career, Martin has won an Emmy, four Grammys, a Kennedy Center Honour and an Honorary Oscar.
He has also carved out a career as a musician, and in 2009 he released an album called The Crow, packed with collaborations with other bluegrass and country artists, including Dolly Parton.
Last month, the musical Bright Star, which he wrote with singer-songwriter Edie Brickell premiered in New York.
