Leaked letter: NHS chiefs criticise health shake-up

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
NHS bosses have "little confidence" in proposals to shake up health services in Shropshire, a leaked letter reveals.

The long-term plan includes the reorganisation of all services including hospitals, GP surgeries and social care.
NHS England said millions of pounds of funding may not be available and asked for a revised scheme to be submitted.
Simon Wright, who is leading the sustainability and transformation plan, said it was not the "finished article".

The NHS England letter, seen by the BBC, was sent to Mr Wright following the publication of the draft proposals, which have been criticised by bosses at Shropshire Council and Telford and Wrekin Council.
Written by two managers from North Midlands NHS, it says the plans did not take into account the "deficit position" for the area's clinical commissioning group (CCG) and the out-of-hospital care model and financial plan "does not form a credible basis for operational planning".
It also raises concerns of Â£271m of external funding required, noting the possibility "this level of capital funding will not be available".
The authors say the STP must be revised and resubmitted by 23 December.
Mr Wright said the plans are "a working document", and more detail "will be added as the various work streams progress".
"This includes work to address deficit levels across the system," he added.
Councillor Shaun Davies, leader of Telford & Wrekin Council, said: "These latest comments are not surprising given the unrealistic timescales the STP board is working to set by NHS England.
"NHS England's concerns echo those that both councils made, particularly around a financial model that bears little resemblance to reality."
Clive Wright, chief executive of Shropshire Council, previously warned plans to reorganise healthcare in the county are being "rushed".
In more changes facing Shropshire healthcare, the Future Fit board has proposed moving women's and children's services to Shrewsbury and potentially downgrading Telford's A+E department.
