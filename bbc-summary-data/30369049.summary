O'Sullivan led from the off and went 5-1 ahead in the first session, before Trump pulled two frames back to stay within touching distance in York.
He then fell 9-4 behind but a superb revival saw Trump emerge from the brink, making breaks of 120 and 127 to level the contest at 9-9.
But Trump fouled from a snooker in the last as O'Sullivan won 10-9.
O'Sullivan broke his left ankle while out running before the tournament and was in significant discomfort in the early rounds. After the first round, in which he wore a protective brace, he said he might pull out as it was too painful.
However, the pain seemed to ease as he progressed, compiling a magnificent maximum 147 break in his quarter-final.
He collected £150,000 prize money, plus £44,000 for the 147.
"That is the hardest match I have ever played," O'Sullivan told BBC Sport. "I was going through the motions and accepted I was going to get beaten.
"I didn't know what day it was but I found something towards the end and was able to hold my position."
O'Sullivan - who has now won every UK final in which he has appeared - was the highest-ranked player left in the tournament after the surprise exits of world champion Mark Selby, defending champion Neil Robertson and Chinese number one Ding Junhui.

The 39-year-old looks to be getting better with age and his success in the competition comes 21 years after he won it for the first time in 1993.
He has now won each of the UK, World and Masters titles on five occasions. His 27th ranking win leaves him one behind Steve Davis and nine behind Stephen Hendry in the all-time list.
This match was billed as a contest between two players with attacking and aesthetically-pleasing styles, and O'Sullivan was running away with it at 9-4 before Trump mounted a brilliant comeback.
But a lack of composure when in amongst the balls early on caused the damage, enabling O'Sullivan to pick him off.
"When your opponent is dishing up every time, it is demoralising and dents your confidence," said Trump.
"Towards the end I let go and I made a good clearance to go 9-9. I felt so relaxed and was waiting for the chance in the last but the good safety won it for him."
