The 32-year-old, a former Essex captain, has scored 7,934 first-class runs at an average of 36.73, including 12 centuries and 46 half-centuries.
Pettini, who also served as Essex's one-day opening batsman, made his debut for the County Ground club in 2001.
"Leicestershire have shown great faith in me and I'm excited to be a part of the squad," he said.
"The vision that Wasim Khan and Andrew McDonald have for the club is extremely exciting and I'm already looking forward to next season."
He joins Leicestershire on the back of a disappointing campaign in Division Two of the County Championship in which they won only two matches.
Pettini is the third experienced county pro to sign for the Foxes for 2016, following the recruitment of Middlesex all-rounder Neil Dexter and Lancashire opener Paul Horton.
