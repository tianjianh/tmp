The Blues youth product, 20, spent most of last season on loan at the New Lawn making 24 appearances and helped the club get promoted to the English Football League for the first time.
Cooper is the son of Rovers boss Mark and the grandson of former Leeds and England left-back Terry Cooper.
He becomes the newly-promoted club's fourth signing of the summer.
Cooper told the club's official website: "After last year with success coming for us it was great for me, the team, and all the staff.
"Having spoken to other clubs I wouldn't be sure to play first team football, but coming here that's my main aim."
Cooper joins another Birmingham recruit - Reece Brown - in the Forest Green squad for next season alongside other new arrivals - defenders Callum Evans and Lee Collins.
