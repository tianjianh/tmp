It's believed that the eggs came from five containers which had washed off a cargo ship in bad weather.
The tiny German island of Langeoog is located in the North Sea and has a population of under 2000 people.
The mayor of the island, Uwe Garrels decided to allow the local children to collect as many of the eggs as they wanted.
