The Toffees, who did not confirm the deal, have already rejected one loan bid from the Serie A club.
Middlesbrough are also reportedly interested in the former Barcelona player, who has made 13 appearances for the Premier League club this campaign.
The Spaniard, 22, joined Everton in 2015 for Â£4.3m.
He spent the 2013-14 season on loan with the club.
