The All Blacks ran in 12 tries, with Sonny Bill Williams and Julian Savea both touching down twice.
Over 61,000 fans were in attendance, more than three times the previous best crowd for a rugby match in the USA.
New Zealand fielded an inexperienced line-up, but were impressive ahead of their meeting with Stuart Lancaster's England at Twickenham next Saturday.
The match - the first on US soil between the two sides since 1980 - was broadcast live on NBC in America.
Bob Latham, chairman of USA Rugby, described the match as "monumental" for rugby in the United States.
New Zealand Rugby Union's chief executive Steve Tew told BBC World Service Sportsworld: "Our guys finished the game with a lot of respect for the US boys. They took it to us for periods of the game, but unfortunately when we had the ball they weren't able to match us for pace and power.
"I think we've done our bit - we've given them a profile they haven't had here before.
"The primary reason we wanted a game on the way, we've got to play England next Saturday at Twickenham - a little bit like the World Cup will be next year for us.
"We have a pool that doesn't have the hardest opposition in it and then we hit a quarter-final at Cardiff and we'll see either France or Ireland play us if we finish first - so this replicates that to a degree.
"We know we've got a big battle in front us at Twickenham."
