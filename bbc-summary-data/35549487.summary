The pair are reunited at Ashton Gate, with Smith previously playing under Johnson at Oldham Athletic where he started his managerial career.
Oldham avoided the League One drop under Johnson in 2013, having taken over with the Latics 21st in the table with 10 games remaining.
"He saved us from relegation and I know he can do it here too," said Smith.
"We had a good time at Oldham and I am looking forward to working with him again."
Smith, 25, left Johnson's Oldham for Bristol City in 2014 on a three-year deal.
Former Norwich City trainee Smith helped the Robins to the League One title and the Johnstone's Paint Trophy last term, but they sit 21st in England second-tier competition after 30 games.
Johnson, 34, who spent six years at Bristol City as a player between 2006 to 2012, was appointed as Bristol City head coach before their 1-0 win at Charlton Athletic last week and takes charge of his first game against Ipswich on Saturday.
The Robins are in search of back-to-back wins for the first time this season.
"He will want us to attack, get in the box and get shots on goal," Smith told BBC Radio Bristol. "I think he will be a brilliant fit and he really loves the football club.
"He always said that he wanted to get the job at Bristol City one day.
"His communication skills and player management skills are very good. I think it is a brilliant decision by the board. He is a young, hungry manager."
