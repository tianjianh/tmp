Former Wales captain Barry Horne has admitted there is pressure on Wrexham boss Gary Mills ahead of the derby with Chester at the Racecourse on Saturday.

Wrexham board member Horne, who won 59 international caps, believes a negative result against their rivals could make things "turn for the worse."
Horne said the Dragons' board fully supported Mills, but admitted results have not been satisfactory.
"On the pitch it's been disappointing," Horne told BBC Radio Wales Sport.
He continued: "Inconsistency is costing us really. Automatic promotion certainly already looks very, very difficult.
"Even the play-offs are not going to be easy, but it's not impossible."
Wrexham are 14th in the National League and nine points off top spot with a section of fans booing the manager in recent weeks.
"I won't deny there is some dissent in the stands. It's strange how that has built up. It seems to have bubbled up quite seriously of late," Horne said.
"At the moment the fans are still with us in our quest to get back to the Football League.
"Everyone on the board are diehard Wrexham fans. We feel the same as the fans. We are aching to get back up there."
Horne says Mills still has the support the hierarchy at Wrexham, but admits he can ill-afford a derby defeat.
"Gary Mills has the full support of the board. We've got a massive game coming up on Saturday and Gary is preparing for that," he said.
"It's bigger than usual because it comes at what might could viewed as a critical time.
"The unrest and discontent amongst fans could be put aside for a little while with a good performance and good result.
"But if it was to go horribly wrong against Chester and they took the spoils, things could take a turn for the worse. There is no doubt about that."
