Blackpool have parted company with manager Neil McDonald following their relegation from League One.

He joined the Tangerines at the start of the campaign after their drop from the Championship, but was unable to prevent back-to-back relegations.
McDonald, 51, had already spoken about being unsure of his future after the final-day defeat at Peterborough.
The former West Ham assistant manager won just 13 of his 50 games in charge during his one-season stay.
"I'd like to take this opportunity to thank Blackpool, its staff, players and fans for their support throughout what has been a very difficult season," he told the club website.
"Despite being extremely disappointed by our relegation, I am pleased with the work we have done over the past 12 months to rebuild the squad and I leave having laid stronger foundations than when I first arrived."
McDonald started his reign with just six contracted players, and the squad he built went on to spend almost the entire campaign in the bottom half of the table and around the relegation places.
The Seasiders, who were in the Premier League as recently as 2010-11, will now be looking for an eighth manager since 2012 to lead them when the League Two season kicks off in August.
Blackpool chairman Karl Oyston added: "Myself and the other members of the board would like to place on record our thanks to Neil for his hard work during a challenging season both on and off the field."
