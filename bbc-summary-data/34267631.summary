New study into flights between central Scotland and Skye

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The economic benefits of more flights between Skye and central Scotland are being examined in a new study.

Loganair ran services from Ashaig Airfield, near Broadford, to Glasgow until 1988. Loch Lomond Seaplanes uses the strip for scheduled flights.
The economic study was recommended in 2013 by consultants who examined the costs of re-establishing a service.
The Scottish government said at the time that it had no plans to fund the return of flights to and from Skye.
Highlands and Islands Enterprise (HIE) has commissioned the new research.
Stuart MacPherson of HIE, said: "Strong reliable transport links are of course crucial to a successful and competitive region.
"Air services from and to small rural airports can play a key role in the communities they serve, creating a sense of connectedness, providing life-line services and supporting economic growth.
"Skye is served by the road bridge and by ferry services but it is over two hours from the nearest airport and at least a five hour drive to the central belt.
"We need to be clear about the full extent of the benefits of reintroducing a regular air service for the island and surrounding area as this will help inform the business case to re-establish the service."
The previous research, Skye Air Services Feasibility Study, looked at what would be needed before scheduled services could resume.
It suggested that resuming commercial flights could require capital spending of between £9.7m and £15.3m.
However, investment of only about £2.3m to £2.8m would be needed if the length and width of the small runway met with the Civil Aviation Authority's (CAA) approval.
Agreements would also have to be reached with the Department for Transport on security fencing,with airline operators on hangars and the fire service on what facilities it would require to keep costs down.
Capital expenditure would rise if the airstrip had to meet certain standards on runways, such as length, width and requirements on runway end safety areas.
The study was funded by HIE, Highland Council, which owns the site, and transport body Hitrans.
Ian Blackford, who was a spokesman for campaign group FlySkye and is now the local MP, told BBC Radio Scotland that he believed an agreement could be reached with the CAA to make the project affordable.
The strip was built in the 1970s by Army engineers, and appears briefly in a scene from the 1980 film Flash Gordon, which starred Sam J Jones, Max von Sydow, Timothy Dalton and Brian Blessed.
The air strip remains available to the emergency services and scheduled commercial flights.
Loch Lomond Seaplanes, flies up 200 flights per month between March and October, and carries about 10,000 passengers a year. It regularly operates scheduled flights from central Scotland to Skye.
