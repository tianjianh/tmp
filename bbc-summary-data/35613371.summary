The Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA) said the fish, which weighed "a few tonnes" was found near the A78 Shore Road.
North Ayrshire Council was notified along with Largs Coastguard Rescue Team which photographed the shark.
Basking sharks can be up to 40ft long and are the largest fish found in British waters.
They are the second largest fish in the world, after the whale shark, according to the Shark Trust charity.
An MCA spokeswoman said: "This was reported to us by a member of the public in the evening of 23 January. The shark was dead when it washed up. It was 15ft long and weighed a few tonnes.
"North Ayrshire Council was contacted and we sent Largs Coastguard Rescue Team to confirm it. All relevant agencies were informed."
