The former Republic of Ireland Under-21 international played 11 times for Wimbledon after joining in January.
Smith, 23, has signed for the Pilgrims subject to completing a medical.
The ex-Gillingham, Stevenage and Watford man failed to agree a new contract with the Dons.
Meanwhile, Plymouth boss Derek Adams has admitted that his squad will be "much-changed" in League Two next season.
The Pilgrims are waiting for decisions on contract offers from 11 players, but Adams wants new faces as well.
"A bit of both is always good because you need a freshness to the squad as well," the 40-year-old told BBC Sport.
"I think that you always want continuity, but the way the game is these days that is a very difficult thing to have.
Plymouth are preparing for their sixth season in League Two after losing in the play-offs two years in a row.
"The players that are still with us next season will have the benefit of that, but the squad will be much-changed from last season," added Adams.
"We have players that have been with us over the last number of seasons that will be with us next year, and we'll add to the team as well."
