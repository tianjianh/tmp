Rob Kearney: Ireland full-back's Lions prospects hit as he undergoes bicep surgery

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Ireland full-back Rob Kearney has been forced to undergo bicep surgery in another injury setback for the British & Irish Lions hopeful.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Kearney, 31, required a knee operation two weeks ago and a Leinster statement said this latest injury would rule him out "for a number of weeks".
He has been out since sustaining a knee injury in training before Ireland's Six Nations game against England.
Kearney injured a bicep in Ireland's second Six Nations game against Italy.
Leinster wing Adam Byrne sustained a "low grade" hamstring strain in Saturday's European Champions Cup win over Wasps and will miss the Pro 12 leaders' contest with third-placed Osprey this weekend.
Flanker Rhys Ruddock was ruled out of Saturday's European quarter-final by a calf strain but could return for Saturday's game in Wales along with hooker Sean Cronin, who featured for Leinster A on Friday.
Ireland hooker Cronin had been out of action since January because of a hamstring injury.
Dave Kearney [toe] and Dominic Ryan [knee] are also set to return to Leinster training this week following periods out because of injury.
The Leinster statement also added that Johnny Sexton emerged unscathed from the European quarter-final despite needing shoulder treatment during the game.
