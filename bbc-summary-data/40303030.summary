Pawel Lupa, 41, of Gleneagles Drive in Kirkby-in-Ashfield killed his partner Aleksandra Mrozik, 47, at their home in July, Nottingham Crown Court heard.
A jury found him guilty of the murder of Ms Mrozik and guilty of the attempted murder of Wojcek Bocek, 32.
Lupa attacked his two victims after an altercation at their flat in a "callous attack", Judge Gregory Dickenson said.
The judge said Lupa had shown a "total disregard" for his partner's fate, adding: "You did not lift a finger to try to help or to comfort Aleksandra (after the attack)."

Lupa's barrister Peter Joyce said all three of the people involved in the argument on 16 July 2016 were "heavy drinkers".
"I've never seen a greater consumption of alcohol in any case," he said.
The court heard that Lupa threw a meat cleaver at Mr Bocek and then used a different knife to stab Ms Mrozik in the chest and through the arm.
She was treated by paramedics in the front garden of their home but died on the way to hospital.
Lupa was sentenced to 12 years for attempted murder and will serve the term concurrently with his murder sentence.
Det Ch Insp Hayley Williams of East Midlands Special Operations Unit said: "Both victims were subjected to frenzied attacks.
"There was blood in every room of the house, on several neighbours' doors as Mr Bocek frantically tried to get help."
