[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
League Two side Accrington Stanley have signed Liverpool defender Lloyd Jones on loan for one month.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 19-year-old spent time in League Two on loan at Cheltenham this season, making six appearances.
Jones moved to Liverpool from Plymouth's academy and played for the Wales Under-19 team before switching his allegiance to England.
"His experience at this level with Cheltenham will help him," said Stanley boss John Coleman.
"Defence is probably the one area that we're a bit short in and Lloyd will be a great addition to our squad."
The centre-back is available for Accrington's game at Burton on Saturday.
