Irish Navy in 'terrible' ship deal

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A former Irish Naval Service vessel sold for 110,000 euros (£93,500) two months ago, is being offered for sale in Holland for 685,000 euros.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
LÉ Aisling is being sold as a fisheries protection vessel in the Netherlands.
The sale of the vessel appears to have been "a terrible deal", said the Permanent Defence Forces' Representative Association.
PDFORRA, which represents navy sailors, said it could not understand why a higher reserve had not been set.
The LÉ Aisling spent 36 years in service before it was decommissioned in June 2016 and sold at auction earlier this year.
There were only two bids for it when the vessel was auctioned in Cork.
It was bought by Dutch ship broker Dick van der Kamp, who said he planned to resell it on the international market.
Auctioneer Dominic Daly, who sold LÉ Aisling on behalf of the Department of Defence, as well as two other vessels, said significant costs would have been involved in preparing LÉ Aisling for re-sale.
Mr Daly told RTE that the cost of towing the ship to Holland and re-classifying the vessel could have run to hundreds of thousands of euros.
He added that naval vessels are sold without classification and have to be re-classified before they can go back into service.
In January, an Irish government jet sold to a US firm for less than 420,000 euros two years ago was revealed to be insured for $5m (£3.87m)
