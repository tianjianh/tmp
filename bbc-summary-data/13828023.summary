Amy Winehouse has been booed by crowds in Serbia's capital Belgrade after appearing to be too drunk to perform.

The concert was due to kick off her 12-day European tour, but was not the performance that 20,000 fans had hoped to see.
For almost 90 minutes, Amy Winehouse mumbled her way through parts of songs.
She sang a few strained notes, before stumbling across the stage and at one point throwing her microphone to the floor.
At times she left the stage altogether - her band attempting to fill in.
She was frequently booed by the crowd. Many had paid up to â‚¬45 (Â£40) to see her in a country in which wages are some of the lowest in Europe, and their anger was clear.
The Grammy-award winning singer had been under strict instructions not to drink after recently finishing a course of alcohol rehabilitation in London.
Hotel staff on her European tour are said to be under orders to remove alcohol from her room.
She has struggled with addiction for some time and it was hoped this tour might mark a new start.
The singer is due to continue the tour with a performance in Istanbul on Sunday.
