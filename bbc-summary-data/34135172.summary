Boxer Fred Evans admits punching cage fighter friend

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Olympic boxer Fred Evans has admitted punching his cage fighter friend at a pub, a court has heard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Evans, from Cardiff, admitted unlawfully wounding Michael Wilson after they had been drinking at a Gloucestershire pub for "several hours".
Mr Wilson spent four days in hospital following the incident last October with a broken jaw and a displaced nose.
Evans, 24, was told he could face jail and sentencing was adjourned.
He is the current Olympic silver medal holder at welterweight after he was runner up at the London 2012 Olympics.
Mr Wilson told the court he was "shook up still" and "frightened and nervous".
Judge Jamie Tabor QC ordered a pre-sentence report and bailed Evans until 12 October.
