[SN]TITLE[SN]
Scottish League Two: Montrose 1-0 Berwick Rangers

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Gary Fraser scored the only goal as Montrose ended their League Two campaign by beating Berwick Rangers to end a seven-game winless run.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Neither team had anything to play for and Fraser's 19th goal of the campaign settled a low-key affair.
The striker collected Christopher Templeman's pass and slotted past Kevin Walker two minutes before the break.
Blair Henderson had an effort blocked in front of goal as Berwick's five-game unbeaten streak came to an end.
