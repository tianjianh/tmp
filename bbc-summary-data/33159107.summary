[SN]TITLE[SN]
Teacher training summer school cancelled over costs

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A major summer school that helped to train teachers has been cancelled by Northern Ireland's Education Authority (EA) due to a lack of funding.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
About 2,000 teachers attended the Regional Training Unit's (RTU) summer school each year.
The summer school had been running for more than a decade, and this year's event was due to take place on 18-19 August.
An EA spokesperson said it cost Â£50,000 to run in 2014.
The RTU's budget has also been cut by 25%, from Â£1.2m in 2014/15 to Â£893,000 for the coming school year.
Teachers continue to train and develop their skills when they are in a job, a process known as continuing professional development.
The RTU summer school was particularly popular as teachers could get training without having to arrange for other colleagues to cover their absence from school during term time.
During the school, they learned from experts in a range of areas, and shared teaching techniques they could then use in the classroom.
A number of teachers said that what they learned in the summer often had a major impact on how they taught pupils.
A group are now trying to organise their own training school to fill the gap left by the cancellation.
They plan to run 'NI Ed Camp' on 18 August in Stranmillis College in Belfast.
Daithi Murray, a senior teacher at St Paul's High School in Bessbrook, County Armagh, is one of those involved.
"We're educating children who are going to live in a society that we can't even imagine," he said.
"So teachers, using their own summer holidays to invest in their own professional development, is something that we can't take lightly and just allow to disappear."
In a statement, the Education Authority said that "the decision to cancel the summer school was based on the reduced financial allocation for 2015-16".
They also said they would "continue the development of staff through programmes, such as the Professional Qualification for Headship, which would have a greater impact on the development of the teaching profession".
