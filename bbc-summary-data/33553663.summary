The people who never go online

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
From paying our bills on a laptop to chatting to friends through smart phone apps, almost every aspect of our modern lives relies on a strong broadband connection.

Everyone uses the internet nowadays, don't they?
Well, no. Not everyone.
Earlier this year the Office for National Statistics reported that almost nine out of 10 adults in the UK (44.7 million people) have used the internet in the last three months.
That's a lot. But it means there are still 5.9 million people (11% of the UK's adult population) who never go online.
So, who are these people? Why are they not using the internet? And are they really any worse off?
Unsurprisingly, most of those who spend their entire lives offline are older. Almost everyone aged between 18 and 54 are recent users of the internet, the ONS report found.
But that figure falls away dramatically in the older generation, and amongst the over 75s just a third could be described as "silver surfers".
The geographical spread of internet users is also hardly surprising: in London and the south-east of England almost 90% of the population are connected to the world wide web.
In Scotland, 85.4% of people are online; in Wales, 82.5% and in Northern Ireland fewer than eight in 10 (79.6%) people have used the internet in the last three months.
Less reliable figures from the ONS suggest that one in five people in Dumfries and Galloway are not connected.
A poor broadband service in parts of the region is partly to blame for the situation but work is ongoing to bring so-called "superfast broadband" to region.
James Pocock is responsible for improving digital connectivity in Dumfries and Galloway. As the council's Next Generation Broadband manager, he is the local link with Digital Scotland, a partnership of public, private and voluntary groups which promotes the digital technology.
He is aiming to meet an ambitious Scotland-wide target to have 95% of homes and businesses connected to superfast broadband by the end of 2017, but he admitted that the south of Scotland has suffered from poor infrastructure in the past and there are challenges ahead.
"What has been completed to date could be regarded as the easier infrastructure to deliver and we are now looking at how we can push that infrastructure out to harder to reach areas," he said.
"That will be more challenging and more time consuming."
But it is a vital resource for the area, he said.
"So much of what we do everyday is either done or supported by online activity. Whether that is learning, purchasing services, it's just part of everyday life in a modern economy that we live in nowadays."
Janice Rutherford, a grandmother from Cumnock, has no interest in using the internet.
Her grown up children have tried to convince her that she could save money by shopping and paying her bills online, but she is not so sure.
"I know all these things happen but that's for other people. It's not for me," she said.
Even if she was given a free computer and unlimited, free internet access, she said she still could not be persuaded.
Would anything persuade her to get online, to get her own Facebook page?
"No, especially not a Facebook page," she said. "There's too much going on on Facebook that I don't like, especially when other people put me on it."
People on low incomes, those with disabilities and older people are among those who are least likely to use the internet, according to Sue Irving, chief executive of the Dumfries and Galloway Citizens Advice Service.
And it can be a huge stumbling block for jobseekers and those applying for Universal Credit, which can only be applied for online.
Ms Irvine said: "There's a push to move benefit applications online so if you are not computer literate, you don't have access to a computer, you don't have broadband, then it's really difficult for people."
Without the purchasing power internet shopping offers, it can also hit the poor and vulnerable in the pocket, she said.
"We produced a report about the cost of living in the region and what we were seeing was... that if people aren't able to have the purchasing power that you have on line, then there's a disadvantage to that as well.
"If your local shops have high prices and you don't have transport, you have a disability or a young family, then you are not able to be savvy in how you shop because you're not able to use the online facilities," she added.
Many libraries in Scotland offer basic computer literacy courses, and they are listed on the Let's Get On website.
However until 100% of the population are digitally literate, Ms Irvine called for "flexibility" and "understanding" from the government.
"It might sound efficient to say put everything online, and for some people that would probably work very well, but for a lot of people it doesn't," she said.
"It's about understanding at government level and at local government level that not everybody is computer literate, not everybody has access."
She added: "We would like there to be a flexible approach to that so for those who want to stick with paper systems, they should be able to do that."
