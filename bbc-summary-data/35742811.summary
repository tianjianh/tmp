Security staff at hospitals in Coventry and Warwickshire are wearing body-worn CCTV cameras to record incidents.

The body cameras have been used by University Hospitals Coventry and Warwickshire NHS Trust (UHCW) since 1 March.
They can be turned on if situations with patients become serious, and are also able to record audio footage.
The trust says the move will help to keep patients and staff safe from violence.

An NHS Protect report revealed there were 188 reported assaults on staff in 2014-15, compared to 156 in the previous 12-month period and 89 in 2010-11.
Body cameras are already in use at hospitals in Cardiff, Oxford and Sussex.
Verbal warning will be issued before turning on the audio recording equipment, and the footage could be used in any potential court case.
Staff have been given training in using the cameras, as well as on the legal issues around evicting people from the hospital.
UHCW security manager Barry Newell said security staff are only deployed at hospitals "in extreme circumstances" and cameras would only be used "when absolutely necessary".
"Occasionally a small minority [of patients and visitors] do show violence or aggression, and these measures will assist our security teams in helping the police investigate any incidents of criminal behaviour," he said.
