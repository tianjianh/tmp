Research by the OECD, an organisation that looks at how people live and work around the world, suggests that some places that invested heavily in tech often experienced worse results than those that had limited access.
They looked at schools around the world and concluded that the ones that spent lots of money on technological learning aids had seen "no noticeable improvement" in the reading, mathematics or science tests.
