Dr Ben Clark, 40, was one of three air ambulance staff to be honoured at the Pride of Britain awards for treating victims of the Alton Towers Smiler crash in June.
Former England captain Beckham decided to join in when Dr Clark was photographed at Monday's ceremony.
The Midlands Air Ambulance Service later tweeted the photo.
Beckham was among celebrities attending the event at London's Grosvenor House, which honours brave members of the public.
Dr Clark and his colleagues previously said they "broke every rule in the book" to rescue those stuck on the ride after it crashed.
Speaking about the rescue, Dr Clark, a volunteer with North Staffordshire BASICS emergency doctors, said: "I didn't know if it was going to work and if they were going to stay alive.
"When you see people dying in front of your eyes and you know you can't do anything any quicker - it was very difficult."
