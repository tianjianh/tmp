The Ardglass man carded a 66 in the third round to finish seven under and in a tie for ninth at Galgorm.
The top 24 progressed to the Shootout format, a series of six-hole stroke play games to determine the winner.
Austria's Mattias Schwab topped the leaderboard on 11 under while tournament ambassador Michael Hoey was tied 45th on two under after a 70.
There was a five-man play-off for the final two spots with Max Orrin and Manuel Trappel  going through.
"I'm very pleased - I had two good chances on my last two holes that got me into the play-off and then luckily I managed to get a birdie and get through," said Austrian player Trappel.
"I was obviously very nervous. Playing in a play-off is always nerve-racking but I managed to keep calm and did my best, and it worked out pretty well.
"Sunday will be interesting for sure. I had a bit of experience from the matchplay event in Spain earlier in the season.
"The crowds and the set-up of this tournament are amazing, such a good course, so it should be a special day."
The top eight get a bye into the second round of matches on Sunday with Sharvin competing in the first round.
Sharvin will play Portugal's Ricardo Santos in his first-round match.
