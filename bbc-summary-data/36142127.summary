The hosts, who began the game bottom of Super League, ran in five first-half tries as they seized control.
Sa'u, Rob Lui, Niall Evalds, George Griffin and Josh Jones all scored as they led 28-6 at the break.
Thomas Minns scored twice as Rovers fought back but Sa'u grabbed two more and Lui his second to secure victory.
Maurice Blair, Iain Thornley and Ken Sio also scored for the Robins, who outscored their hosts four tries to three in the second half.
Sio's score was spectacular as he broke out of a two-man tackle to run in from 70 metres, but he injured himself while scoring and had to be helped from the field and was given oxygen.
Victory lifted Salford, who will be appealing against their points deduction and Â£5,000 fine for breaching salary cap regulations in 2014 and 2015, two places in the table, leaving last season's champions Leeds Rhinos bottom.
Salford head coach Ian Watson: "It was important we won after the week we've had and we believe we are good enough to get back in the top eight even with the points deduction.
"It was important we got back on the horse to start clawing back the points and it was a really big win."
Hull KR head coach James Webster: "Salford played well and came up with some good plays at the right time.
"We went into the game with a lot of busted people and a depleted squad but did some good things and tried hard.
"There are 10 games to go and we will come back fighting and have not given up."
