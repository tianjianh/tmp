Children's mental care in Dorset criticised by CQC report

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Children's mental health care services in Dorset must be improved if their safety and welfare are not to be put at risk, a health watchdog has said.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A Care Quality Commission (CQC) inspection found "concerns" with some areas of Dorset HealthCare's mental health services for young people.
Inspectors found staff did not assess risks to children waiting for assessment or treatment effectively.
Vacant posts and sick leave also meant waiting time targets were missed.
The report into standards at The Child and Adolescent Mental Health Service (CAMHS), run by the Dorset HealthCare University NHS Foundation Trust, criticised services in Weymouth and Portland and in Bournemouth and Christchurch.
In east Dorset inspectors found the mental health crisis service was struggling to provide a night-time telephone helpline due to staffing problems and its home treatment service was also affected.
The report also highlighted problems at Weymouth, Portland and Bridport minor injuries units where a clearer assessment system was needed and low numbers of staff were also an issue.
The trust said it was working hard to make improvements
The trust's chief executive, Ron Shields, described it as "a fair assessment".
"It provides us with a platform to take all our services from where they are to outstanding," he said.
The CQC said inspectors found "outstanding" care and treatment in both acute inpatient mental health services and the forensic community services.
It said inspectors would return to check improvements in the 10 areas identified had been made.
