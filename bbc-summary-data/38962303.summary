A BBC TV reporter who claimed she was the victim of a "witch-hunt" has had her case struck out by an employment tribunal.

Sally Chidzoy told the hearing she was targeted after raising concerns that an MP appeared to convince a senior colleague to drop one of her stories.
The BBC argued it had not been influenced and disputed her claims.
The case, which was held at Cambridge Magistrates' Court, was discontinued in its second week.
An usher at the tribunal told the BBC the case "has been concluded".
A BBC spokeswoman said: "The case against the BBC has been struck out by the tribunal."
The spokeswoman said she could not yet give any more details.
A member of Ms Chidzoy's legal team said: "I'm sorry, we can't say anything."
Ms Chidzoy has worked at the BBC for 30 years and is currently home affairs correspondent for BBC Look East.
The tribunal previously heard that she had been investigating East of England Ambulance Service boss Anthony Marsh's salary package.
She said the story was dropped after then-Liberal Democrat health minister Norman Lamb emailed BBC Look East assistant editor Steve Silk in July 2014.
The journalist further alleged she was "falsely imprisoned" by management during an attempt to seize her phone.
Ms Chidzoy also claimed she was sexually discriminated against and victimised.
