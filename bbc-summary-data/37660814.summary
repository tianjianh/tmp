Woman praised for bid to stop car theft in Belfast

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A woman who fought back when a man tried to steal her car in the centre of Belfast has been praised by a judge for her bravery.

Gavin Gerard Francis Wilson, from Lady Street in the city, was jailed after admitting four offences arising from the incident last April.
The woman was praised for "having a go, rather that just standing back and letting this man steal your vehicle".
Wilson was given a two-and-a-half year sentence.
He initially denied that he tried to steal the Toyota car from the centre of Belfast.
However, during a trial which was held at Belfast Crown Court last month, Wilson admitted his guilt.
The hijacking happened around tea-time on 1 April last year, when the woman had parked her car at Kent Street and was standing outside her vehicle checking her windscreen wipers.
The driver's door was closed and the keys were still in the ignition. At this point Wilson - who was dressed in dark clothing with a hoodie and scarf covering most of his face - got into the driver's seat.
The owner was able to yank open the driver's door and pulled herself onto Wilson's lap using the steering wheel for leverage.
She was also able to pull the keys out of the ignition - but as the car had a turbo timer, the engine remained on for a full minute.
Despite a struggle between Wilson and the motorist - during which she stuck her finger in his eye - the car was driven a short distance before colliding with a white van.
The court heard it then crashed into a 'stop' sign and Wilson fled on foot.
During sentencing on Friday, the judge spoke of the "considerable inconvenience" caused to the motorist. She had to pay for the damage to her car, and had to review her personal security as both her house and car keys were taken during the incident.
A defence barrister said Wilson was "very apologetic" and had written a letter to the woman as he was "acutely aware of the hurt he has caused her".
Wilson admitted four offences including aggravated vehicle taking, causing damage and driving whilst disqualified. He was told he will spend half his sentence in prison, with the remainder on licence upon his release.
He was also banned from driving for four years.
Wilson was told by the judge: "I note this took place on April Fool's Day, and you were certainly the fool."
Commending the female motorist's bravery, the judge added that Wilson "found more than he could handle" when the woman fought back.
He said the woman "had the guts and determination not to put up with you stealing her car ... she has to be praised for what she did".
