The model, chassis number one, was made at the Rover factory in Solihull in 1969 and still has its original engine.
The car was considered lost for a number of years after its original green paintwork was resprayed gold and the number plate was changed.
Since 1991, it has been on display in the showroom of the Land Rover Centre in Huddersfield.
Sales manager at the centre, Mark Griffiths, said the car had only been out on a number of occasions for photo shoots and video promotion work.
He said: "I'm one of the few people who've driven it in the last 23 years, it's probably done less than 100 miles.
"It's a little bit agricultural compared to to the modern day models but it was so advanced for its day and it's still really drivable."
The true identity of the car was discovered when it was sold to the centre in 1991.
It was fully restored and repainted and issued with its original registration number, YVB 151H, by the DVLA in 1997, Mr Griffiths said.
He said: "It's been a great talking point for us; people who are doing restorations on their own cars have come in to take a look and take photos.
"I've sold thousands of cars in the years I've been here but this time I'll be very sad to see it go."
Warwickshire-based auctioneers, Silverstone Auctions, said the car still had all its original components including its chassis, engine, gearbox and axles.
