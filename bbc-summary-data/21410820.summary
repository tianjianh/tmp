[SN]TITLE[SN]
Foston pig farm given extra time on proposals

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A firm behind plans to build a farm in Derbyshire with more than 25,000 pigs has been given until May to answer Environment Agency questions.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
More than 27,000 people signed a petition against the proposed Midland Pig Producers (MPP) farm near Foston.
The Environment Agency said the questions concerned the facility's air filtration system.
MPP said it did not meet the first deadline because the independent expert chosen to analyse data was unwell.
The Environment Agency said the new deadline was now 30 April.
A spokeswoman for MPP said: "The Environment Agency requested some additional information which we are happy to provide.
"However, unfortunately, the independent expert who has been asked to undertake analysis of our data has been unwell, meaning that we could not provide the requested information by 31 January.
"Therefore we requested and were granted a short extension."
Dominic West, who starred in US crime drama The Wire, and chef Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall, both oppose the project due to its size.
The petition was set up over fears for the welfare of the animals.
MPP had said the proposed farm will protect welfare standards and, thanks to sophisticated filtration systems, neighbours will not be affected by smells or pollution.
