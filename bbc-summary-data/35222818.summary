Warrington Hospital A&E facing 'unprecedented delays'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Warrington Hospital has urged people to avoid its A&E unit unless there is a life-threatening situation because of "unprecedented delays".

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Medical Director Professor Simon Constable said patients faced waiting times of up to eight hours on Tuesday as the unit reached full capacity.
The department is expected to stay full until the end of the week.
"Priority as always was given to severely unwell or injured patients," said Prof Constable.
"We were disappointed that many people continued to present with minor ailments which could have been seen and treated by their GP or local pharmacist.
"However, we did not turn anyone away."
