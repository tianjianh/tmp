The 18-month old Tabby cat, named Tiger, was found injured at the family home in Kernaghan Park when his owner returned to the house on Wednesday.
The cat was taken to a veterinary clinic for treatment and police have begun an investigation.
Ch Insp Derek McCamley said it was an "utterly disgusting" attack that would "upset pet owners far and wide".
"Tiger's owner is understandably shocked and very upset and all officers and staff at Lisburn and Castlereagh PSNI (Police Service of Northern Ireland) hope the little cat makes a full recovery," the officer said.
"It is hard to understand why someone would do this to a defenceless vulnerable family pet but we need to know who did this.
"We need to speak to anyone who was in the area of Kernaghan Park, Hillsborough before 5pm (17:00 GMT) on Wednesday 9 March when the cat was found."
The officer added that the police have "no information to suggest that this is anything more than an isolated incident".
