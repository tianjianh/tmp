Souare, 26, injured his leg and jaw bone in Sunday's crash and will stay in hospital while he receives treatment.
He was not part of the side that beat Middlesbrough 2-1 on Saturday.
"The club are liaising closely with the hospital on his progress," Palace said in a statement. "Our thoughts are with Pape and his family at this time."
Palace manager Alan Pardew said Souare may have broken his leg and could face a lengthy spell on the sidelines.
"Thankfully he looks sound other than that, just a bit bashed up," he told Sky Sports.
"We'll have to look after him and get him back as quick as we can because he's a great lad and it's a big loss. It is a blow but these things happen, and more importantly it's not more than it could have been."
The Senegal full-back, who joined the club from French side Lille in January 2015, last played for Palace in the 1-1 draw with Bournemouth at Selhurst Park on 27 August.
Souare's Palace team-mate Yohan Cabaye tweeted: "Be strong! I wish you a very good recovery."
