[SN]TITLE[SN]
Grimsby Town 1-1 Luton Town

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
James McKeown saved a stoppage-time penalty to earn Grimsby a point against Luton.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Chris Clements' opener was cancelled out by Isaac Vassell before, with the game into five added minutes, referee Mark Haywood pointed to the spot after Danny Collins handled in the box.
But after his dramatic return to the side following Dean Henderson's recall to Manchester United, Grimsby's long-serving keeper kept out Danny Hylton's spot-kick to preserve a share of the spoils.
After a tight, goalless first half, Luton re-started brightly, with Brandon Comley having to hack clear a low cross from on the line.
But just as the visitors were starting to step up a gear, Grimsby broke the deadlock when Ben Davies - after seeing an effort charged down - kept the move alive with a fine, hanging cross to the far post, where Clements powered his header home from close range.
However, the Hatters hit back when Pelly Ruddock nipped in at the corner and crossed into the area, where Vassell headed home despite McKeown's best efforts.
They looked to have sealed the victory when they were awarded their 95th-minute penalty, but McKeown was to prove Grimsby's saviour.
