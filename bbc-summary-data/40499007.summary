Former boxing world champion Mayweather and UFC champion McGregor, who are due to box on 26 August, will begin the worldwide promotion in London, a source close to both camps told the BBC.
Thousands of fans could attend in what is expected to be a free event.
Details of the date, ticketing and arrangements are still closely guarded.
American Mayweather, a former champion at five weights, is coming out of retirement at 40 to fight 28-year-old UFC lightweight champion McGregor from Ireland.
Both fighters are expected to earn up to $100m (Â£78.5m) from the bout, which would make it one of the richest in history.
