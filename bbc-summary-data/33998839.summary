Plans to expand Newhaven Port with a new berth and slipway have been approved by councillors.

The French port owners also want to deepen a channel to allow larger ships to dock.
Hundreds of residents complained about the loss of their only sandy beach, and the Sussex Wildlife Trust objected to the destruction of shingle habitats.
However, Lewes District Council's planning committee approved the scheme, voting 7-2 in favour.
Port manager Francois Jean said the development would be good for Newhaven.
He said: "It's very important not only for the port but for Newhaven town and the district.
"It is opening new opportunities for the future and attracting new businesses and new activities in Newhaven and creating jobs."
