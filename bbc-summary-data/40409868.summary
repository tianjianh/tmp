Neath Abbey gets cash boost and CGI reconstruction

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A 900-year-old abbey is revealing its history via a new CGI reconstruction.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Neath Abbey has played host to Cistercian monks, Tudor splendour and thriving industry since it was founded in the 12th Century.
In recent years, the site managed by Cadw, has become a tourist attraction and there are plans for conservation work to take place.
Parts of the site which are currently closed will be opened to visitors once the Â£550,000 project is completed.
Visitors are being offered a CGI reconstruction of the site, showing the ruin rebuilt to its former glory.
The improvements coincide with conservation work to conserve the abbey's under croft in a bid to protect it against further rain damage.
The first phase of the conservation project is due for completion in July, with further work is to be finished by March 2018.
These works include further conservation to the Tudor mansion, including raking out and repointing stonework, repairs to stone-framed windows, consolidation of loose stonework and capping works to high level walls.
