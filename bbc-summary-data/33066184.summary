Alderley Edge shows how local politics could be changing

It is home to footballers, celebrities and millionaire business tycoons, but the Tory heartlands of Cheshire could be witnessing a change in the culture of local politics.

Alderley Edge is the kind of place where you might have thought the Conservatives could win local council seats without really trying.
The average selling price for houses here is currently around Â£886,000, and it's right on the edge of Chancellor George Osborne's Tatton constituency, which he retained easily in May's general election.
The Tories also eased comfortably into power the last time there was a parish council election, back in 2011.
At the time, no-one stood against the Conservatives in any of the small local authority's nine seats - meaning there was actually no need for an election after all.
This year, though, things could not have been more different.
For a start, there was actually an election. There were 18 people standing for office, instead of the usual nine.
Ballot papers had to be printed and counted, and for the first time in years the 4,600 residents of the village had a chance to go out and vote.
The opposition to the Conservatives were an intriguing set of local renegades - from a software CEO to a chutney and relish producer.
Wearing white rosettes and styling themselves "Alderley Edge First", their main selling point was that as independents they had no party to be loyal to.
The result was a resounding win, with the Tories beaten in all nine seats.
It all started a few months before the elections, says Rachael Grantham, one of the village's new independent councillors.
"We were a group of nine independent people who wanted to change how the parish council was run in the village," she said.
They decided to avoid negative campaigning. Even now she has won, Ms Grantham is adamant that the previous Conservative administration "did a pretty good job".
The new council comprises a mix of youth and experience.
Ms Grantham works in her family's food and wine business, and describes the group as "a bit of a random bunch of people".
While most parish councils do not have a huge amount of power, they do deal with issues which are important to people.
In Alderley Edge, the council is responsible for making sure litter is picked up and flowers are planted. It also represents local views on issues like planning applications and parking.
The new independent councillors share a belief that party politics have no real place when it comes to such ultra-local issues.
Ms Grantham said: "It's important that decisions are made for what's best for the village, and not really related to any party politics."
These sort of "anti-politics politicians" are now using that logic to win parish and town council seats across England.
Frome in Somerset has a town council which is made up exclusively of independent councillors, who have knocked out the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats over the last two elections.
Pippa Goldfinger is the council's deputy mayor.
She said: "A lot of us were activists and campaigners, but not members of political parties. We're more hands-on type people than tribal people. For us that's worked really well because we want to get things done, not go to endless meetings and bang gavels and argue."
For voters in Alderley Edge, the idea that party politics is largely irrelevant to local village life seemed to resonate.
Michael, who runs a dry-cleaning shop, said: "Just in Alderley Edge I don't think political parties have a bearing on things. It's about who's going to do the right sort of thing by the people."
A general anti-politician feeling plays a part too. Mark lives here and told me the new independent councillors "can express what the people here are thinking about" as the voice of "the normal everyday person".
For the Conservatives in the chancellor's back yard, all of this is something to think about.
Michael Jones runs the much larger Cheshire East Council, responsible for the majority of council services in the area.
Insisting his party will learn lessons, he said: "Perhaps people felt they weren't being listened to. Well now they must be and they will be."
And there is of course a risk for Alderley Edge in that all of its councillors are new to the job.  The experience built up by the long-serving members of the old administration has now completely gone.
But as Michael in the dry-cleaning shop said: "We're yet to see whether it's going to work or not.
"But we've got to run with it and see what happens."
