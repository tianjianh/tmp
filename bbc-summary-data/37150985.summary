It could be a person who gives up their time to encourage others to take part in sport, be someone who is helping to unearth a champion of the future or maybe they are the ones who keep a local club going.
The BBC Get Inspired Unsung Hero award has been running since 2003 and recognises the remarkable achievements of people throughout the UK.
You can nominate your unsung sporting hero until 23 October and the Welsh winner will be announced at the BBC Cymru Wales Sports Personality of the Year award in December.
