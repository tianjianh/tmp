The drugs were found during a search of a car in the Trench Road area.
About £10,400 in cash was also seized during the search of a van on the Toombridge Bypass at Hillhall Road.
The searches took place on Thursday night. Both men, aged 25 and 40, are being questioned by police.
Det Insp Tom McClure said: "We remain committed to making Northern Ireland a hostile environment for those individuals and groups who are involved in major drugs crime.
"We will continue to work to identify them, disrupt their activities, arrest them and place them before the courts. We will also seek to ensure that they do not derive any material benefit from their illegal activities."
