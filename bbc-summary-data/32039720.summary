He will replace Lord Rowe-Beddoe after standing down as WRU chief executive in October, following the Rugby World Cup.
Transport Minister Edwina Hart said he was "the right person to steer our future ambitions" at the airport, bought by the Welsh government in 2013.
Mr Lewis said the airport was "crucial" to the economy of Wales.
