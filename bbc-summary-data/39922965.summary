The 40-year-old, who is based near Malpas in Cheshire, fell from her mount Topwood Beau and was airlifted to Bristol's Southmead Hospital.
British Eventing (BE) said last week she suffered a traumatic brain injury.
In a further update on Monday, BE said she was about to be moved to the neurological ward.
"Emily is progressing steadily, and the family would like to thank everyone for their messages of support and thank Southmead Intensive Care Unit for their wonderful care," it said.
Topwood Beau, a 14-year-old gelding, was uninjured in the fall, which happened at the third fence - Keepers Question - on the cross-country course.
Gilruth, who is married with two young daughters, made her Badminton debut in last year's event.
She has competed in British Eventing competitions for 18 years and runs her own yard.
