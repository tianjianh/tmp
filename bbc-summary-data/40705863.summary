Sporting Lisbon midfielder Ryan Gauld is on the verge of agreeing a season-long loan deal with Desportivo Aves.

The Scotland Under-21 international has made only five appearances for Sporting since joining from Dundee United on a six-year deal in 2014.
The 21-year-old spent part of last season on loan at Vitoria Setubal but joined Sporting's first-team squad for pre-season training.
Desportivo Aves won promotion to Portugal's top-flight last season.
They finished second in Liga Pro to secure only their fourth campaign in Portugal's top division.
Despite limited first-team opportunities at Sporting, Gauld believes the move has benefited his development.
The spell at Vitoria Setubal last season, cut short due to a disagreement between the two clubs, provided him with regular experience of first-team football in the Primeria Liga.
"This season was a bit up and down," Gauld said during his return to Scotland in the summer.
"I got what I wanted to begin with - experience in the first division to see if I could handle it and then that loan move was cut short, which was frustrating."
