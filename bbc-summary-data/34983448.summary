Lancashire have targeted an overseas bowler for next season, says cricket director and head coach Ashley Giles.

The Red Rose are back in Division One after their promotion and will also defend the T20 Blast title they won for the first time.
Last season, Australia pace bowler Peter Siddle joined as an overseas player but his Ashes call-up meant they then added all-rounder James Faulkner.
"I think domestically we're done if you like," Giles told BBC Radio Lancashire.
"We've been able to re-sign a lot of our own players, which is really exciting for the future as we've got some really good young players.
"We're looking for an overseas player, certainly for red-ball cricket and probably a T20 specialist as well, so we've got some shopping to do over Christmas.
"I've got no problem in saying we're looking for a bowler who can bat a bit."
Former England spinner Giles, 42, believes that the mandatory coin toss being scrapped in both Championship divisions - with the visiting captain being offered the opportunity of bowling first - is a positive move.
"I know why it's been done, which is primarily to bring spin back into the game and stop sides preparing perhaps what you'd call "green mambas" at home," he added.
"I think it should be good for our game as there have been too many matches that have finished to two or two-and-a-half days."
Lancashire get their 2016 campaign under way against Nottinghamshire on 17 April.
