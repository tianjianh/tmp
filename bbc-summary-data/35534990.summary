Harris Tweed secures a coat of arms

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Harris Tweed's orb trademark has been officially recognised as a coat of arms.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
For years, the mark has identified tweed made from cloth woven by hand in the Western Isles with wool yarn from island sheep.
The Lord Lyon, King of Arms, has granted that the orb be the industry's coat of arms.
The Harris Tweed Authority said the recognition would provide a further layer of protection from imitations.
The orb will be incorporated into a shield to become the coat of arms.
Norman Macdonald, chairman of the Harris Tweed Authority, said: "Being awarded a Grant of Arms is a historic milestone for Harris Tweed which has fought for decades to protect the sanctuary of the Harris Tweed cloth.
"It's the ultimate protection for our products which are known for throughout the world for consistently high standards of quality and authenticity.
"It's an honour to receive the Grant of Arms from Lord Lyon himself and we are grateful to be able to ensure the security of our cloth and its heritage for generations to come."
