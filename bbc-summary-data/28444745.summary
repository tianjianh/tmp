[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A pub earmarked for development has been bought by the Wilts and Berks Canal Trust, which aims to turn it into a centre for visitors.

The Peterborough Arms at Dauntsey Lock is one of only two canalside pubs along the length of the canal.
In April 2013, the owner Wadworth Brewery shut the pub saying it was not viable as a business.
"We believe we can make this into a tourist destination," said Chris Coyle, acting chairman of the canal trust.
The trust plans to keep the pub operating but also wants it to be expanded and enlarged to house a cafe and museum.
Boat trips, bicycle and boat hire are also planned.
"We are also very keen for this to be a centre for the surrounding community," said Mr Coyle.
The trust is working to restore the canal so that boats can sail along its full length - some 50 miles (80km).
