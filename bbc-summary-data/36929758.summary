[SN]TITLE[SN]
Bristol City 2-1 Wigan Athletic

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Bristol City came from behind to win against Championship newcomers Wigan Athletic in the first league game at the fully-redeveloped Ashton Gate.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Wigan went ahead when new signing Alex Gilbey latched onto Yanic Wildschut's left-wing delivery to fire home.
Tammy Abraham, who joined Bristol City on loan from Chelsea, levelled from close range with 10 minutes to play.
Bobby Reid scored a late winner for the hosts when Wigan failed to clear their lines and his deflected shot went in.
Reid's strike helped Bristol City to their first win on the opening day in the Championship since their 1-0 victory against Blackpool in 2008.
Defeat for Wigan in their first game back in the Championship after a one-season absence means they have won just one of their last seven opening day games, their last victory having come against Barnsley in 2013.
Gilbey, who scored five goals in 37 League One games last season, joined the Latics from Colchester United on a three-year deal this summer.
Having scored 74 goals in 98 youth games for Chelsea at different levels, Abraham got on the scoresheet late on with his first goal in senior football.
Bristol City head coach Lee Johnson: "We put an awful lot of work into signing Tammy Abraham, meeting his parents and convincing Chelsea of our philosophy.
"But we felt he was worth waiting for. He is a top talent and we now have two centre forwards capable of getting a lot of goals this season.
"I am looking forward to helping a top young player improve. He is a very grounded lad with great parents and we need to keep his feet on the ground and help him develop."
Wigan manager Gary Caldwell: "The first half was very positive and we can take a lot from it. If we had continued in the same way I couldn't see us losing.
"Our squad looks light and we need to strengthen with some new faces who can add some quality at Championship level.
"The players we have need some help. We showed for 45 minutes that if we stick to our game plan we can do well, but we have to maintain our form for 90 minutes."
