[SN]TITLE[SN]
Bronington workman hit by car while helping lorry reverse

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A workman who died when he was hit by a car was helping a lorry to reverse into a yard in the dark, a court has heard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Philip Ledward, 62, of Whitchurch, Shropshire, died in November 2011 while working for Arkenfield Stable Hire Ltd.
Mold Crown Court heard it was "an accident waiting to happen".
The company, of Bronington, Wrexham county, and general manager Phillip Sutton both deny breaching health and safety rules.
The company has been charged with failing to ensure the health, safety and welfare at work of employees by failing to ensure a safe system of work with vehicles.
Mr Sutton faces a similar charge which alleges he consented or connived with the company, or that the offence was attributable to his neglect.
The court was told Mr Ledward, a heavy goods vehicle mechanic, was one of three workmen guiding the articulated truck at the company's yard at Boundary Garage on the A495.
Two colleagues were in the road trying to stop traffic and Mr Ledward was stood talking to the lorry driver when he was hit by an oncoming car. He died at the scene.
Christopher Stables, prosecuting for the Health and Safety Executive, said no risk assessment had been carried out and the practice had been used for some time.
He said it was "fraught with dangers, particularly in the darkness".
He argued Mr Sutton was in day to day charge and must have known what was going on.
The death happened because the company operated an unsafe system of work and the incident was "utterly foreseeable and avoidable", he claimed.
The trial continues.
