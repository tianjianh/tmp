Blackburn Rovers are a club that need help in the future, says outgoing manager Paul Lambert.

The 46-year-old confirmed on Thursday he has activated a clause in his contract to leave Ewood Park after the final two games of the season.
"Do I fear for the club? No, I certainly hope not," Lambert told BBC Radio Lancashire.
"It's a great club and I don't think anybody should be under any illusion how good it is, it just needs help."
The Scot added: "I can't probably put it as nicely and bluntly as it needs a bit of help."
With debts of Â£102.4m revealed last month, Lambert stated he would 'wait and see' about his future after talks with the club's owners Venky's.
Venky's, run by the Rao family that owns the club who are based in India, bought the club in 2010 but have seen their debts rise after relegation from the Premier League in 2012.
"I don't want to get into name calling and all those sort of things," added the former Aston Villa boss.
"There is no bad feeling, there is no animosity or infighting, all those sort of things that make you leave a club. I've got nothing but good things to say about Blackburn Rovers.
"Financially nobody can point the finger at the owners for what they've done for the club because they've spent an awful lot of money, and probably been hit by bad situation with the money maybe not being spent the right way."
With Ronny Deila leaving Celtic this summer, Lambert has been quickly installed as odds-on favourite with several bookmakers to take over at Celtic Park
"You'll probably get all that, the only connection I've got with Celtic is I played eight great years," stated Lambert.
"It's a fantastic club, a great club and you like to think you've done your bit in that time. But as of this minute I'm back to square one where I was when I left Aston Villa."
The Blackburn Rovers Football Community Action Group have had their say on Paul Lambert's departure and voiced their frustrations about the owners.
"This entire situation has been created by the Rao family and their chosen advisors," said a statement.
"Paul Lambert was very vocal in his concerns at the lack of communication and direction from the owners, whilst supporters are left to look on as one dark day in the history of their club is simply replaced by another.
"The message from the supporters of Blackburn today is resounding in that if the Rao family cannot run our football club in an open, transparent and responsible manner then they should seek a new owner who will protect the heritage and proud history of this community football club, and allow it to rebuild from a disastrous five-and-a-half-year Venky's reign."
