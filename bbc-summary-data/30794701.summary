Orkney's cruise liner industry was worth more than £4m to the local economy in 2014, and the islands are now set for their busiest ever year.

The number of cruise ships visiting Orkney will top the 80 mark for the first time in 2015, with 83 port calls by liners so far expected - four more than in 2014.
They have the capacity to carry more than 80,000 passengers and 25,000 crew.
More bookings are still expected for 2015.
With 64,000 passengers visiting in 2014, the council estimated that Orkney's cruise ship industry generated around £4m for the economy.
Michael Morrison, business development manager for Orkney Islands Council's marine services, said: "We're all set for a record-breaking year for cruise ship visits.
"We're seeing more visits by bigger vessels, resulting in greater overall passenger numbers for Orkney.
"The increase in the size of ships visiting demonstrates the confidence that the industry has in our ability to deliver a first class experience for visiting passengers.
"Orkney remains, despite stiff competition from other developing cruise ports, the most popular cruise ship destination in the United Kingdom."
The Disney Magic liner is among those expected in 2015.
