Police received calls at about 01:00 reporting a vehicle was repeatedly ramming the metal shutters of the Spar on Main Street, East Wemyss.
The thieves then tried to pull an ATM machine from the store using the red Toyota truck.
The vehicle then made off in the direction of Kirkcaldy without the ATM and was found dumped in Boreland.
Det Sgt Paul Dick, of Police Scotland, said: "The premises appear to have been broken into in order to steal the cash machine which was within the shop.
"After violating the security of the store the vehicle was then used in an attempt to pull the ATM from the store.
"There were believed to be four males involved who were all wearing dark-coloured balaclavas."
"This is an unusual type of crime in this area and I would ask anyone who was in the area of Main Street, East Wemyss, at the time or who saw a red-coloured Toyota pick-up acting suspiciously in or around the area to contact Police Scotland."
