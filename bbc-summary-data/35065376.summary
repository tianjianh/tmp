The top three have been chosen by an expert panel from an original list of 10 contenders.
This year's winner will be announced at the Sports Personality show, live on the BBC from Belfast on 20 December.
Past winners have included footballer Wayne Rooney, diver Tom Daley and tennis player Andy Murray.
The shortlisted 2015 trio were selected from nominations made to the BBC by sports governing bodies via the Youth Sport Trust and in partnership with CBBC's Blue Peter programme.
"It is really inspiring to see such great talent coming through in the world of sport," said Will Roberts, assistant director at the Youth Sport Trust.
"We had a difficult time narrowing the list down from 10 to three as all of these young sports men and women have a dazzling future ahead of them and have shone brightly in 2015. We wish them all the best of luck for the night."
The top three have been chosen from an original list of 10 which also included Brinn Bevan (Gymnastics), Sam Curran (Cricket), Sophie Hahn (Para-Athletics), Morgan Lake (Athletics), Matthew Lee (Diving), Molly Summerhayes (Winter Sport-Freestyle Ski) and Rebekah Tiler (Weightlifting).
The BBC Young Sports Personality of the Year is awarded to an outstanding young sportsperson who was aged 17 or under on 1 January 2015.
Gymnast Claudia Fragapane won the award in 2014 after her triumph at last year's Commonwealth Games.

Ellie is the younger sister of Team GB Olympian Becky Downie. Ellie's commitment to her education led her to achieve 5 GCSEs at A-C, while competing internationally winning multiple medals in various competitions. In doing so, she secured a place at her first-choice sixth-form college. Alongside sister Becky, Ellie also regularly hosts training sessions at her gymnastics club where children get the chance to train with her.
Five years ago, Tully was merely a spectator watching her mum, Amanda, swimming for fun. Tully has a progressive neurological condition that causes muscle weakness, and was reclassified earlier this year. Tully's first appearance on the international stage was in 2013, where she won one gold, three silver medals and three bronze medals in her age group at the 25th German Open Meet in Berlin.
Tom first attended the British Racing School in 2012 for Pony Racing tuition. Tom quickly advanced through the Pony Racing Training and in his final season attended a week-long course for the 10 most promising pony racing jockeys in the UK.
Richard Hannon Jr, a previous champion trainer of racehorses and Tom's boss, has said: "There's no doubt Tom has the ability to go all the way. He rides very well and is a pleasant lad who works hard and deserves all the success he has had these past 12 months."
