The Addicks are 13th, seven points off the play-offs, heading into Wednesday's London derby at Millwall (19:45 GMT).
"Once I get more players in, and more players fit, I back this team to compete massively," he told BBC London.
"We are not even halfway through the season and some people are almost disregarding us."
The 36-year-old, who is still awaiting his first win following his appointment on 24 November, added: "We are certainly not finished. The year will end but the season is just beginning.
"I am looking forward to 2017. I have this little feeling we are going to be alright."
Charlton are aiming to secure an immediate return to the Championship following their relegation from the second tier last season.
Robinson expects to be backed in the transfer window by Charlton owner Roland Duchatelet, who has been the subject of protests from a section of supporters who are unhappy with how the Belgian businessman runs the club.
"It is important we get the players in that we want," the former MK Dons manager said. "We want to make this a powerful club again.
"I want this club to move forward and, once we get to the Championship, we compete in the Championship.
"Our objective is to be in the promised land [the Premier League] like everyone else but we can do that. It will take two, three or four years but they are the visions you have to have."
