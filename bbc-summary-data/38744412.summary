The Honest Men became the first team in the cup to use a fourth substitute in extra-time with Michael Rose replacing Nicky Devlin against Queen's Park.
Though defender Rose only came on in the 121st minute at Hampden, he played an important part in Ayr's win.
After a 2-2 draw, Rose scored from the spot in a 5-4 penalty shoot-out win.

The Scottish FA announced in September that a fourth replacement could be used in extra-time in this season's competition.
England's FA Cup will allow a fourth substitute in extra-time from the quarter-finals onwards, starting this term.
It was an eventful match at the national stadium with League One Queen's Park twice leading their Championship opponents and then having a man sent off.
Paul Woods and Bryan Wharton netted for Gus MacPherson's Spiders but those goals were cancelled out by Craig Moore and Conrad Balatoni.
The hosts' Sean Burns was dismissed in the first half of extra-time after receiving a second booking.
A shoot-out ensued after Rose's introduction and though he was successful with his kick from 12 yards, team-mate Paul Cairney missed his at 2-2.
But Ayr goalkeeper Greg Fleming saved from Wharton and Gregor Fotheringham to give the visitors a 5-4 win on penalties.
They will host Clyde or Stirling Albion at Somerset Park on the weekend of 11 and 12 February.
