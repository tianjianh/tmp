Swansea City: Huw Jenkins against Swansea squad overhaul

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Chairman Huw Jenkins says it would be "dangerous" for Swansea City to react to barely surviving in the Premier League by making major squad changes.

Swans have had three managers in 2016-17 with Paul Clement having arrived in January with the club at the foot of the table.
Their struggle ended as Hull were relegated instead after their 4-0 defeat by Crystal Palace.
"I don't think it needs a big overhaul in the squad," said Jenkins.
"I think that's always dangerous."
There has been speculation over the futures of striker Fernando Llorente and midfielder Gylfi Sigurdsson, whose efforts played a major part in the Welsh club looking forward to a seventh season in the top flight.
Sigurdsson has 13 assists for the season, while Llorente has 14 goals and scored in each of the three victories Swansea recorded during a timely late unbeaten run of four matches.

Chelsea were reportedly interested in Llorente in January while Everton have been linked with Sigurdsson.
Jenkins hopes neither player wants to move on with Llorente contracted until the end of 2017-18, while Sigurdsson has signed a deal until June 2020.
"Now and again you get players who want to leave the club for whatever reason and we have to deal with that," Jenkins told BBC Radio Wales Sport.
When asked whether Sigurdsson and Llorente would want to stay, Jenkins responded: "We'll have to discuss that and hopefully they will."
"It's always a difficult one offering new contracts to players every year."

Jenkins says the club's priority will remain being financially stable while hoping to hold on to their top players.
"I don't think there's been many an occasion at Swansea City over the last six years in the Premier League when players have left because we've wanted to transfer them," said Jenkins.
"And I think that will always continue as finances will dictate and we'll do our best to make sure that better players want to stay with us.
"Sometimes we don't satisfy everybody's wishes, but we've got to try and work within the financial situation we are in and parameters we've got.
"We'll always try and do that and make sure the club is financially sound and to me that's first and foremost."

Jenkins remained chairman when Swansea were taken over by an American consortium led by Steve Kaplan and Jason Levien in July, 2016.
There has been controversy over their management of the club since, particularly the decision to appoint Bob Bradley as the Premier League's first American manager in October.
He took over from Italian Francesco Guidolin, was was dispensed with after poor early form.
Clement succeeded Bradley and after overseeing a change in fortunes and hopes Sigurdsson and Llorente will be part of his squad next season with talks to start with the American owners and Jenkins over the next few days.
"Gylfi has remained extremely professional - and there has been a lot of speculation about him during this period," said Clement.
"But he's focused totally on playing well, putting the work in on the training field, delivering performances week-in, week-out, home and away.
"There's no wonder that the fans have this affection for him.
"I've enjoyed working with him and I would like to do that moving into the future, but we'll see what happens.
Clement added: "I think Llorente and Sigurdsson have enjoyed their time here this season, especially the second half.
"They've been instrumental in our form and how we've done, but no decisions have been made on any player, really, moving ahead to next season.
"We need to do that over the coming days, but ultimately me as the manager, coach, I want to keep the best players here."
