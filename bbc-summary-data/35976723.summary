Engines from India, Russia and China among others are being introduced in a new film The Great Race.
The new engines are due to only feature in the film and won't be appearing in future TV episodes.
The producer of the film has denied claims the filmmakers had bowed to political correctness.
Ian McCue told the Telegraph: "The intention was to create this big global racing event and make it feel real. I would hope it will get youngsters asking about foreign countries."
The Great Race is the eleventh animated feature film for Thomas and the new characters are likely increase interest from international markets.
It is released worldwide from May 2016.
In the Great Race Thomas competes against the new international engines at the Great Railway Show.
The Flying Scotsman represents the UK, while Thomas competes to represent the island of Sodor where he lives.
