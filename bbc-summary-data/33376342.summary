[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Forth Bridge is set to become Scotland's sixth Unesco World Heritage Site.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Members of the UN's heritage committee have gathered in Germany for the start of a three day meeting, where the bridge's nomination will be considered.
It has been recommended for approval, with inspectors praising it as an "extraordinary milestone in the history of bridge construction".
A final decision is due to be taken some time before Sunday night.
The distinctive red rail bridge spans the Firth of Forth between South Queensferry, on the outskirts of Edinburgh, and North Queensferry in Fife.
It opened in 1890 after eight years of construction work, and at 2,529m long was at the time the world's longest multi-span cantilever bridge.
Supporters of its bid for World Heritage Status have described it as a masterpiece of human creative genius.
Unesco appeared to agree with that assessment in its inspection report, which stated: "This enormous structure, with its distinctive industrial aesthetic and striking red colour, was conceived and built using advanced civil engineering design principles and construction methods.
"Innovative in design, materials, and scale, the Forth Bridge is an extraordinary and impressive milestone in bridge design and construction during the period when railways came to dominate long-distance land travel."
World Heritage Sites are those which Unesco considers to have an internationally significant cultural or natural heritage, and whose value is considered to transcend national boundaries.
The aim is to protect and preserve them for future generations.
There are currently 1,007 World Heritage Sites spread across 161 countries.
Other Scottish landmarks to have been given the status are Orkney's Neolithic sites, the Antonine Wall, New Lanark, St Kilda and Edinburgh's Old and New Towns.
