Five Things

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Let's have a look at some of the stories in Oxfordshire that proved popular this week.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A car showroom in Iffley Road is being used as "Oxford's unofficial homeless shelter", according to squatters.
The building, owned by Wadham College, will be redeveloped into student housing, but campaigners have asked for it to be used as homeless housing until it is redeveloped.
Midcounties Cooperative holds the lease for the ground floor and said it was working "towards a collaborative outcome".
A council has reversed its decision to allow a gymnastics club in Oxford to move to larger premises.
Cherwell Gymnastics Club moved to a warehouse in Blackbird Leys, but Oxford City Council now says the premises are registered as a "key employment site".
Hazel Walsh, chairman of the club, said she was in "shock".
An eight-year-old girl who wrote to ask an Oxford University professor to visit her school has had her wish fulfilled.
Connie Gordon wrote to Dame Professor Carol Robinson to tell her she wants to be a chemist when she grows up.
The Royal Society fellow surprised Connie and her classmates with an impromptu visit.
The John Radcliffe Hospital cancelled all non-urgent operations for Friday and Monday because of "significant pressures" on its emergency department.
Oxford University Hospital's chief nurse Catherine Stoddart said it was so "patients with the most urgent needs can be treated more quickly".
Patients have been notified of the decision and urgent admissions will go ahead as planned.
And finally, two poems written by an 11-year-old George Michael have been unearthed by an old schoolmate.
Penny Ling, who lives near Faringdon in Oxfordshire, went to school with the singer.
She found the poems in her primary school yearbook from 1974.
