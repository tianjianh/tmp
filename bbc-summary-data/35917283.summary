The Art Show Wot We Done event at Morecambe Library runs from 14 May until 9 July and will feature art "inspired" by the TV comedian.
Organisers Morecambe Artist Colony asked 150 artists to submit work but say anyone can send in "Eric artwork".
The event coincides with an exhibition about the Morecambe-born entertainer at Lancaster's City Museum from 14 May.
The display in Lancaster runs until 10 July and marks the 75th anniversary of when Morecambe and comedy partner Ernie Wise first performed together.
It will include memorabilia from their successful 43-year double act on TV, radio and stage.
Sian Johnson, one of the organisers of the Morecambe art show, said: "Eric is very important to the town - he's our lad.
"I think people will get a lot of pleasure from the exhibition: it's a new way of looking at his life.
"The art will be spread around the library and will also include people's "selfies" at Eric's statue on the prom.
"I think it's the most-loved statue in Britain."
The Art Show Wot We Done exhibition is at Morecambe Library from 14 May until 9 July. Free entry.
