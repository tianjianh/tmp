The latest earthquake hit near the town of Namche Bazar, near Mount Everest.
The US Geological Survey said it had a magnitude of 7.4. An earthquake on April 25, centred in east Nepal, had a magnitude of 7.8.
The latest tremor was felt as far away as the Indian capital Delhi, as well as Dhaka, the capital of Bangladesh.
Strong tremors were felt in the capital of Nepal, Kathmandu, that was badly damaged in last month's earthquake.
"This is a really big one," Prakash Shilpakar, the owner of a craft shop in Kathmandu, told the Reuters news agency.
