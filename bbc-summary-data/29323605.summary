Forget Where's Wally? The question music fans have been asking for the past 18 months is... where's Adele?

Well, the good news, we can reveal that she is working on new music.
A recording studio we visited this week were only too happy to boast about their latest client.
If not yet ready to record them, RAK Studios based in north west London, confirmed that the 26-year-old was writing new songs.
Since giving birth to a son in October 2012 Adele has been keeping a low profile having only released the James Bond theme, Skyfall.
The list also showed that Emeli Sande, Birdy and Mary J Blige had recently been at the studio.
RAK Studios is where Adele recorded most of her debut album, 19.
Diane Warren, who according to the document attended the studios with Adele, has also written songs for Whitney Houston, Christina Aguilera and Rihanna.
In keeping with naming her albums after her age when she started working on them - Adele's latest project is rumoured to be called, 24.
Her previous efforts were titled 19 and 21.
Released in January 2011 Adele's 21 is the fourth best-selling album in the UK of all time.
Emeli Sande's album, Our Version of Events, was released in February 2012 and is also reported to have new material on the way.
As well as RAK studios confirming she'd had recording sessions there, producer Naughty Boy recently told Newsbeat that he was helping Emeli Sande put the album together.
Naughty Boy said: "I think it was good for her to take a break. I think she needed it.
"Sometimes you have to be inspired outside the music business to find inspiration again. You have to live your life.
"She's so ready to come back though and we've written some really special songs."
Naughty Boy worked with Emeli Sande on nine of the 14 tracks on her debut album.
"You can't just sit there and write songs. You have to wait for them to come to you.
"The second album is the hardest because the first was so successful.
"You can't worry about what you did before though."
