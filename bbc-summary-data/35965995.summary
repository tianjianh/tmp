Welsh assembly election app matches voters with parties

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An online app which matches voters with the political party closest to their views has been launched ahead of the assembly elections.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
WalesVote16.com asks users questions and ranks the parties by how closely their policies match the answers.
Cardiff University's Wales Governance Centre created it in the run up to the 5 May vote.
Prof Roger Scully, of the centre, said it would be a "fun way" for people to see where they stood.
He said it was "strictly an academic project" and "not affiliated with any political party or movement".
Prof Scully told BBC Radio Wales' Good Morning programme: "We're absolutely not telling people how to vote, that's not our job.
"But we are trying to help people maybe see how they stand in relation to the parties overall."
