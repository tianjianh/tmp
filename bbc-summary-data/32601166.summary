Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho is close to agreeing a new contract after securing a third Premier League title.

Mourinho, 52, is halfway through a four-year deal signed on his return to Stamford Bridge in June 2013.
And further talks are expected in the coming weeks with the club and the Portuguese keen on a long-term option.
In his first spell at the club between 2004 and 2007, Mourinho won consecutive Premier League titles and succeeded this season with three games to spare.

The 2005 title was Chelsea's first top-flight success in 50 years and he also delivered two League Cups and an FA Cup.
But he left the club to eventually join Inter Milan after falling out with Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich.
Since his return after a six-and-a-half-year absence, which included three seasons at Real Madrid, Mourinho has spoken of his desire to stay as long as the Russian billionaire wishes to keep him.
The Blues boss repeated that after Sunday's 1-0 defeat of Crystal Palace, which secured Chelsea's first title since 2010 and the eighth of his prolific career.
"As I was saying since the beginning of the season, I stay here until Mr Abramovich wants me to stay. The day he tells me to go, I go," said Mourinho.
Mourinho is still to win the Champions League with Chelsea, a competition he has won with Porto and Inter Milan.
