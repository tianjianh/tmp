[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Hundreds of people with diabetes in Cumbria and Lancashire have missed out on vital eye tests because of failings in an NHS screening service.

Patients with the disease are supposed to be offered follow-up eye examinations after being diagnosed.
But it has emerged that since 2010 almost 500 were not given tests, which can detect retinal damage caused by increased blood sugar levels.
Health officials have written to those affected offering new appointments.
Diabetic retinopathy is a common complication of diabetes and occurs when high blood sugar levels damage the cells at the back of the eye. If untreated it can cause blindness.
But it has emerged that systems to ensure those with the disease were referred for specialist eye examinations at local clinics failed to kick in.
The University Hospitals of Morecambe Bay NHS Trust said it was investigating how the errors occurred.
Diabetes UK said it was "concerned" that patients had not been regularly checked.
A spokeswoman said: "Diabetic retinopathy doesn't have any obvious symptoms in the early stages. You wouldn't know you had a problem with your eyes and when you did notice yourself the damage is quite severe."
Sheila O'Brien of Cumbria Societies for the Blind said: "It's not very good that this has happened. But we are pleased that they've now found out about it and are investigating what went wrong.
"What is really important now is that they make sure nothing like this happens again."
It is estimated that 160 people in the Morecambe Bay area were affected, together with 143 in North Cumbria and almost 200 in the Blackpool area.
George Nasmyth, The University Hospitals of Morecambe Bay NHS Foundation Trust's deputy medical director, said: "We are aware of an issue affecting a number of our diabetes patients and their annual eye screening appointments.
"We are working closely with the Diabetic Eye Screening Programme, NHS England and other NHS Trusts to understand what exactly happened, and ensure that we all learn from this and prevent it from happening again.
"All affected patients have been written to directly and invited to attend a screening appointment.
"However, if anyone has any concerns, they can contact 0845 0500 109."
