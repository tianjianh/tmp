Tougher punishments needed for rogue landlords, councils say

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Landlords in England who commit housing offences must face tougher punishments, including jail sentences, the Local Government Association (LGA) has said.

The LGA, which represents councils in England and Wales, said many rogue landlords were receiving "paltry" fines for breaching housing rules.
In one case 10 people, including children, were living in a property infested with cockroaches and mice.
Currently the highest penalty for housing offences is a fine.
The LGA said a small minority of landlords were "creating misery" for tenants.
In theory this can be unlimited, but the LGA said a lack of guidelines was forcing magistrates to take landlords' financial circumstances into consideration during sentencing, resulting in "paltry fines".
The average fine for housing offences is £1,500.
The LGA has called for tougher sentencing guidelines - including the option of custodial sentences - and a blacklist for persistent offenders that could be accessed by local authorities.
It comes as the government considers responses to a consultation it launched on improving the private rental sector and tackling rogue landlords.
LGA housing spokesman councillor Peter Box said: "The courts need to punish rogue landlords proportionately and there should be a consistent standard when it comes to licensing.
"We know that the majority of tenants in the private rented sector are satisfied with their accommodation, but that shouldn't distract from the fact there are far too many rogue landlords creating misery for people who often see themselves as having little choice but to put up with it."
A landlord in Redbridge, north-east London, was fined £3,000 in 2014 for failing to rid his property of mice and cockroaches and forcing 10 tenants, including children, to share a damp and mouldy kitchen.
In Coventry six tenants were forced to live in a property for 12 months without fire alarms and a proper escape route, after which their landlord was fined £100.
"Councils are doing everything they can to tackle bad practice by rogue landlords. However, they are being hamstrung by a system racked by delays, bureaucracy and feeble fines," Mr Box added.
"Magistrates should be able to take the seriousness of the offence into consideration and jail rogue landlords who put lives at risk.
"Fines must match the offence, rather than landlords' ability to pay - which is an open invitation for exploitation."
The National Landlords' Association welcomed plans to drive rogue landlords out of the sector but said courts needed to have the discretion to impose fines that were not beyond an offender's ability to pay.
