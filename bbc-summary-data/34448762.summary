St Helier losing £750,000 in rates on States properties

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The parish of St Helier is losing about £750,000 per year in rates as the States do not pay for their property portfolio.

Constable Simon Crowcroft, in charge of the island's capital, said any other owner would have their property repossessed by now.
The States have never paid parish rates on their properties.
Calls for the States to pay from 2016, rather than 2017 as planned, were rejected by members.
A vote in the States saw 26 vote against the earlier start to 17 in favour.
Mr Crowcroft said: "Rates are so overdue, if we were talking about a domestic rate payer this person would have had their property repossessed many years ago.
"The States have agreed in principle for about 15 years that they should pay rates. The States have to honour their obligation and pay rates."
About 30% of the island's population lives in St Helier, with the majority of businesses and States buildings based there.
The Council of Ministers said it was strongly opposed to the idea of paying next year as there was work needed in how to fund it and make it fair.
It said: "It is right that the States pay rates on their properties, but it must be affordable and funded sustainably.
"Furthermore, it should be part and parcel of more joint working with the Parishes to deliver the best services for Islanders."
Constable Crowcroft said St Helier had the third highest rates in the island, but would ask parishioners what to do with the extra money from States properties.
He said: "When the States starts paying rates next year we could take it as a windfall and lower rates or we could use it as an opportunity to improve services."
