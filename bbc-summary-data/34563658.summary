Officials said the boat had been carrying 36 people at the time of the sinking. Twenty-three were rescued.
It was not immediately clear what caused the incident, close to Zatoka town. One report said it was a passenger boat, another said those on board were mostly fishermen.
The Kiev government has launched an investigation.
The regional governor, ex-president of Georgia and now Ukrainian citizen Mikheil Saakashvili, cut short a visit to western Ukraine to attend the scene of the incident.
