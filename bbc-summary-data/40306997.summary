Villagers have packed into a church to remember the moment its forebears were thrown into the front line of World War One following a German airship raid.

The German L48 was one of the most advanced "height climber" airships, but in 1917 the Zeppelin ran into problems and was shot down over rural Suffolk.
About 100 people gathered at St Peter's Church in Theberton and Eastbridge on Sunday to mark the centenary.
Former BBC Breakfast host Bill Turnbull read a survivor's account at the event.
Suffolk Coastal MP Therese Coffey and Colonel Hermann Hanke, from the German Air Attache to the UK and Republic of Ireland, also attended the service - where candles were lit for each of the German victims and the men from Theberton who died in the conflict.
Col Hauke said that the service showed "friendship can grow out of hatred and tragedy".
"We should not give up working to overcome divisions between people today, however hard and almost impossible it would appear."
On 17 June 1917, the Germans dispatched two Zeppelins during the fateful raid which were able to fly at altitudes of 13,000ft (4,000m) - way beyond the 8,000ft (2,400m) flight ceiling of English fighter aircraft.
One - L42 - crossed the Kent coast at Ramsgate and released its bombs, but L48 endured heavy winds over the Orford Ness coast.
Its compasses froze and it developed engine problems.
John Rea Price, one of the organisers of the service, told how the airship dropped a few bombs over Martlesham and Wickham Market before drifting over Saxmundham and Leiston.
There it was forced to descend to a height that put it in range of Royal Flying Corps fighters, he said.
"Completely crippled by the gunfire, after a terrible descent lasting seven minutes as it became engulfed in flames, the end came in a cornfield between Theberton and Eastbridge.
"Of the 18 crew there were just three survivors."
The dead were laid to rest in the village churchyard before being moved to the German cemetery in Staffordshire.
