The Economy Ministry said industrial production was up 1.9% in July, lifted by an increase in manufacturing and construction output.
It is a big improvement from June when industrial production rose just 0.4%.
It is another piece of strong data from Germany. On Thursday data showed that industrial orders rose at the strongest rate in the more than a year in July.
However last month the ministry released figures to show the economy shrank by 0.2% in the second quarter.
In an effort to avoid further stagnation in Europe, on Thursday the European Central Bank announced a surprise cut in interest rates.
It also launched a programme to buy private sector debt to stimulate lending.
