[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Managerless Wrexham were held 1-1 at Northern Premier League Division One North side Stamford in the FA Cup.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
After Gary Mills' sacking earlier this week, caretaker boss Joey Jones' side went ahead on six minutes through Shaun Harrad.
But a second-half penalty, converted by Lee Beeson, means a replay is needed at The Racecourse on Tuesday, 18 October.
Stamford, who are three divisions beneath Wrexham, were not overawed and created numerous chances.
