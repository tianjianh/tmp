A couple from Wexford have been forced to leave their home after Storm Imogen.

The house was left hanging from the edge of a 75ft cliff after it was damaged during the bad weather.
It is the second storm to cause severe damage in recent weeks.
Roddy Hickson, 72, and his wife Maureen, 68, had lived in the house for 20 years.
Speaking to the Wexford People newspaper, Mr Hickson said: "It's hard to believe that it has come to this. Twenty-eight inches of rain fell in the 31 days of January.
"The waves in the storm on January 25 and 26 threw stones up on our deck, but Imogen was the straw that broke the camel's back, and it took the whole bank away."
"It could go in half an hour's time or in 24 hours. It's a sorry situation.
"We're homeless at the moment, and we're staying with my son in his apartment in Dublin," said Mr Hickson.
It is understood that when the house was built, there was around a quarter of an acre of land between it and the coastline.
In recent years much of the coastline in the area has crumbled due to the impact of winter storms.
As a result several properties have already been lost.
The couple are pleading with members of the public to stay away from the site due to the potential danger.
