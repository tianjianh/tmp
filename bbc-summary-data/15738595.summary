The American was one of four riders to fall at the opening bend in Valencia on 7 November.
The Ducati rider, world title winner in 2006, had a screw inserted into his fractured scaphoid bone during surgery in California.
"Everything went pretty smoothly," Hayden said.
After wearing a brace and using a bone stimulator for four weeks, Hayden will have his wrist X-rayed again to assess its condition.
"The scaphoid is a slow-healing bone, so you don't want to wait only to find out in January that it's not healing correctly.
"I'm happy to get it fixed right so that I'll be ready to go when I need to be," he added.
Hayden expects to be fit for the first day of 2012 testing at the Sepang circuit in Malaysia on 31 January.
