A 42-year-old man has been arrested as part of the investigation which is at a "very early stage", Det Supt Kevin Geddis said.
He appealed for anyone who was on the 14th, 15th or 16th floors of the flats and heard anything suspicious on Saturday or Sunday to contact police.
Sinn FÃ©in MLA Fra McCann said the local community was "in shock".
"Divis Tower is a tight-knit community and this will be felt by those who live there.
"It is too soon to speculate as to the cause of death but the PSNI are treating it as suspicious."
Mr McCann added: "Our thought and prayers will be with the victim's family and friends at this time."
