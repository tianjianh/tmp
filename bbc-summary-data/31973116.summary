[SN]TITLE[SN]
Offshore catering strike possible with consultative ballot over pay

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Industrial action is possible after the association of offshore caterers pulled out of an agreement to give workers a pay rise this year.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Caterers Offshore Trade Association (Cota) had agreed with unions to give a 2% increase.
The Unite union is now to carry out a consultative ballot of its members.
Cota said it was retracting the second year of a two-year pay deal in an endeavour to secure jobs in the industry going forward.
It said it now awaited the outcome of the Unite ballot.
