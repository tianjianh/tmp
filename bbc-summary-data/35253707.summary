The winger touched down early and again in the last minute, with Sam Hidalgo-Clyne kicking 13 points to add to a second-half penalty try.
Treviso have lost all their league matches this season but did cross through full-back Luke McLean.
The victory is Edinburgh's third in a row in the league after back-to-back wins over Glasgow Warriors.
Edinburgh thought they had made the perfect start when Hoyland dived over the tryline with only five minutes played, but the wing had lost the ball forward.
They did not have to wait long to open the scoring, with Hidalgo-Clyne knocking over a straightforward penalty after a succession of infringements by the Italians.
The home side were utterly dominant in the opening exchanges and were rewarded with the game's first try.
A rolling maul from the forwards put Treviso on the back foot, and when the ball was spun wide Hidalgo-Clyne floated a pass to Cornell Du Preez, who showed silky hands to pop a pass for Hoyland to dive over.
Hidalgo-Clyne nailed the touchline conversion to give Edinburgh a 10-point lead that their display in the opening quarter deserved, although James Ambrosini responded with a penalty for Treviso to reduce the arrears.
The Australia-born fly-half knocked over another three-pointer shortly after to reduce the gap to four points as Edinburgh surrendered the initiative somewhat.
Hidalgo-Clyne burst back into life on the half-hour with a searing break, and was only denied a superb try by a last-ditch Sam Christie tackle.
Despite losing all 11 of their Pro12 matches this season, Treviso were making life difficult for Edinburgh - just as they had done against Glasgow Warriors at Scotstoun last month - and the score at the break remained 10-6 to the home side.
Much of Edinburgh's spark was coming from Hidalgo-Clyne, and the Scotland scrum-half slotted two penalties in quick succession to re-establish a 10-point lead.
The capital side were generating no shortage of possession or promising attacking positions, and the Italians were testing the patience of referee Gary Conway by conceding a steady stream of penalties to halt the Edinburgh momentum.
They gambled on the referee's leniency one too many times as Conway awarded a penalty try after a dominant Edinburgh scrum was collapsed close to the Treviso line. Hidalgo-Clyne added the extras to give Edinburgh a cushion at 23-6.
Heading towards a 12th straight league defeat this season, the visitors, to their credit, refused to merely roll over and accept their fate. They worked an overlap to send McLean over in the corner, and Ambrosini kicked the touchline conversion to bring Treviso back within 10 points.
The final stages were punctuated by the whistle of referee Conway as the match petered out as a spectacle, but there was one final flourish for the home side.
Hoyland crossed the line as the clock struck 80 minutes to claim Edinburgh's third try. Greig Tonks' conversion came back off the post; frustrating as a successful kick would have taken Edinburgh above Scarlets in the table.
The real frustration though will be the failure to secure a four-try bonus point their superiority perhaps deserved.
