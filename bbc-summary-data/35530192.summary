[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A Swansea University academic has joined the call for the UK government to invest in supporting new mothers who breastfeed.

Dr Amy Brown, whose research examines barriers new mothers face, signed an open letter in medical journal The Lancet which held a study into it.
It found rates of breastfeeding in the UK are the lowest in the world.
The letter has been signed by midwives, health visitors, paediatricians, peer supporters and university researchers.
It said: "It is not a matter of persuading mothers to breastfeed - most mothers begin breastfeeding and initiation rates are around 80%.
"However, rates plummet in the first weeks and months after birth, and most mothers say they stopped breastfeeding before they wanted to."
The letter also highlights a strategy it wants the government to adopt in order to increase breastfeeding rates in the UK.
Dr Brown said: "The signatories make it clear that the message of The Lancet series is that increasing breastfeeding rates is everyone's responsibility.
"It therefore seems nonsensical to fail to invest in supporting new mothers to breastfeed.
"However, despite public health messages recommending that mothers should breastfeed, these messages are not backed up with support once the baby is born."
