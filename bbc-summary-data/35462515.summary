Ashbourne Shrovetide Football: D-Day veteran to start game

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A D-Day veteran has been chosen to "turn up" the ball at a centuries-old sports event on his 100th birthday.

Bill Milward, from Ashbourne, Derbyshire, will start the scrum on 10 February, the second day of the Royal Shrovetide Football.
Speaking about the honour, he said he first competed in the game in his home town when he was nine or 10.
Mr Milward will join the likes of the Prince of Wales and Sir Stanley Matthews in "tipping up" the ball.

"I think it's a great honour, I was right excited when they told me," he said.
"I think that's what did it, it being my 100th birthday".
Mr Milward, 99, took part in the ritual right up until the outbreak of the World War Two.
He drove an amphibious vehicle during the Normandy landings, carrying supplies to troops.
He was awarded the rank of Chevalier in the Legion d'Honneur last year for his contributions on D-Day.
Mr Milward said he tried to start up a game of Shrovetide Football while he was posted in Italy during the war, but troops were mystified by it.
He is now focused on his responsibilities on the day.
"I have to give a speech - I've never given a speech before," he said.
"I've got it in my mind what I would like to say, 'my Lords, Ladies and Gentleman', that sort of thing'."
Despite looking forward to the experience, Mr Milward said he thought someone might throw something at him if he decided to start the game with "down with it" because of his Down'Ard allegiance.
