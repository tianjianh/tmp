The former Wales international and Blackburn midfielder gave his long hair the red card after nearly missing his flight to the World Cup in Brazil.
He had picked up his wife's passport mistaking it for his own, as they both had the same hairstyle.
"I thought I've got to make a change," he said.
Savage, who sported long blond hair throughout his football career, explained: "I said I'm going to donate my hair to the National Football Museum. They said 'are you serious' and I said well I wasn't but I am now."
Sally Hawley, collections officer at the museum, said: "As Robbie's now a pundit, his hair will go alongside John Motson's coat and Jim White's tie,"
Savage retired from professional football at the end of the 2010/11 season, after playing for Crewe Alexandra, Leicester City, Birmingham City, Blackburn Rovers, Derby County and Brighton and Hove Albion.
