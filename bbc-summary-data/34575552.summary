Stormont crisis: NI paramilitary assessment report awaited

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An official assessment of paramilitary activity in Northern Ireland, compiled by the police and the security service, is due to be published later.

The DUP has indicated its ministers may return to their posts full time if the report says the Provisional IRA has not sanctioned terrorist or criminal acts.
The report was commissioned after the murder of Kevin McGuigan in August.
The police's belief that current IRA members may have been involved in the killing led to a political crisis.
The Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) pulled its only minister out of Stormont's power-sharing government - the Northern Ireland Executive.
The largest unionist party in the executive - the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) followed suit with their tactic of rolling ministerial resignations.
With talks at Stormont deadlocked, Northern Ireland Secretary of State Theresa Villiers asked the police and MI5 to provide a detailed assessment of paramilitary activity.
Three assessors - a Liberal Democrat peer, a Belfast barrister and a former senior Stormont official - have been looking at the report on the paramilitaries.
The report is due to be published at 12:30 BST on Tuesday and will be accompanied by a statement in the House of Commons.
If the DUP is satisfied by what the report says, it is thought their ministers could return to their jobs.
Other major problems however, such as the disagreement between the parties over welfare reform, remain to be resolved.
On Monday, Acting First Minister Arlene Foster told the Northern Ireland Assembly that paramilitary structures appeared to still exist in many communities.
"Despite the fact that we have had a long period of time under which those structures should have disappeared they have not, it appears, disappeared and therefore we have to deal with that issue," the DUP minister said.
"We will wait to see what the panel brings forward tomorrow, but if the panel says that those structures are still in place we will need to look at how we can make sure that they come to end and that, certainly, will be the focus for me and for my party."
The government commissioned this assessment of paramilitary activity when the Stormont talks appeared to be close to collapse.
The DUP felt under pressure to show its anger about reports linking the IRA to a murder, after the Ulster Unionists, the only other unionists in Stormont's power-sharing coalition, quit.
By ordering the police and MI5 to compile this report, and appointing three senior figures to provide their own assessment, the secretary of state bought the time and space for the DUP to return to round table talks.
If they like what the report says, DUP politicians are expected to end their ministers' "rolling resignations" and return to their jobs  full time.
The DUP's opponents are already accusing them of using the paramilitary assessment as a "fig leaf" to return to power.
They may counter that, in the long term, their "no business as usual" policy proved more responsible than outright resignations, which would have collapsed the Stormont Executive.
