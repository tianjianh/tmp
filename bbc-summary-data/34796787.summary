Police believe Jed Allen, 21, killed Janet Jordon, 48, her daughter Derrin, six, and her partner Philip Howard, 44, in a "violent" hunting knife attack.
Their bodies were found at their home in Didcot, Oxfordshire, in May, while Allen was found dead two days later.
Coroner Darren Salter recorded a verdict of unlawful killing.

The inquest into the family's deaths at Oxford Coroners Court heard the words "I'm sorry" were scrawled on the wall of their home in blood.
Another note was left at the scene which read: "I know the truth, I don't want it for me and my family.
"This is the end."
The court heard Allen, whose body was discovered in a wooded area in Oxford, had expressed frustration at his mother's once-a-week heroin habit, and described her as a "junkie" to a friend.
But Det Sgt Ali Driver said it was "speculation" an argument over Philip Howard using heroin had led to the murders.
He said Allen was "anti-drugs".
Police said "all the evidence suggests" Allen killed his half-sister, mother and her partner with a hunting knife he kept in his room.
Consultant forensic pathologist Dr Nicholas Hunt has confirmed he cause of death of the victims was "multiple stab wounds" in a "violent third-party assault".
Recording his verdict, Mr Salter said: "This is a shocking case and one that, despite thorough investigation, still appears inexplicable.
"There were no warnings that were apparent to anyone.
"One might suspect Jed Allen was not of sound mind, but there were no signs of mental health difficulties leading up to deaths."
After the three family members were found dead at home in Vicarage Road a manhunt for Allen began.
His body was found in woodland near Marston Ferry Road, Oxford, two days later.
At about 19:00 GMT on 23 May Jed Allen texted his friends saying goodbye and said: "I'm nothing more than worthless."
A separate inquest into Allen's death heard there was no alcohol or drugs in his system at the time of his family's killing.
There was also no indication of steroid use.
GP Dr David Ellis said Allen was diagnosed with depression in 2012 and also exhibited "dark thoughts about hurting others as he had been hurt".
Allen committed suicide at about 19:30 GMT on May 23, Mr Salter ruled.
In a statement read after the hearing, the Jordon family said: "There are no words that can describe the terrible impact this dreadful event has had on our family.
"We have been left both dumbstruck and devastated.
"The sense of overwhelming grief and loss, for people who were loved so much, is completely unimaginable."
