Det Garda Adrian Donohoe to be awarded Scott Medal posthumously

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A police officer who was murdered in the Republic of Ireland is to be awarded the Scott Medal, the force's highest honour.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Det Garda Adrian Donohoe was shot in a robbery at Lordship Credit Union, near Dundalk in County Louth in 2013.
Gardaí (Irish police) said he was being posthumously awarded the medal for his exceptional courage and bravery in giving his own life to protect others.
It will be awarded at a ceremony in County Tipperary later on Thursday.
The event will be attended by the Tánaiste (deputy prime minister) and Minister for Justice Frances Fitzgerald as well as Garda Commissioner Nóirín O'Sullivan.
A number of other officers will be awarded silver and bronze Scott Medals.
Mr Donohoe, who was married with two children, was the first member of the force to be shot dead on duty for more than a decade.
The 41-year-old victim was one of two detectives on late night escort duty at the rural credit union when the robbery took place.
Police said he was shot without warning and did not produce his weapon before he was killed.
The gang stole 4,000 euros (£3,000) in cash before escaping from the scene.
The gang that carried out the shooting is believed to have fled immediately across the border to Northern Ireland.
The suspected getaway car was found burned out in Fews Forest near Keady, County Armagh, two days later.
Police said they had received full co-operation from the PSNI and other forces.
To date, no-one has been arrested or charged over Mr Donohoe's murder.
