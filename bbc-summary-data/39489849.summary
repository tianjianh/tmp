The display at the history centre will tell the story of Mr Harrison's life and the circumstances of his death in the 1914-18 war.
He was born on 12 November 1890 in east Hull and later became a teacher.
After joining Hull FC he scored 106 tries in 116 matches, including one in the 1914 Challenge Cup Final that the team won.
He played his final game for the team on 26 December 1916, having joined the 11th East Yorkshire Regiment (Hull Tradesmen).
Mr Harrison, who was known as Jack, was awarded the Military Cross in February 1917 after leading a patrol to the German trenches on the Western Front during World War One.
His brigade was then involved in the attack at Oppy Wood on 3 May 1917 during which he lost his life, it was for this action he received a posthumous VC.
"This gallant officer... made a dash at the machine gun, hoping to knock out the gun and so save the lives of many of his company. His self-sacrifice and absolute disregard of danger was an inspiring example to all. "
