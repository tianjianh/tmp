Jersey and Guernsey have saved £600,000 over the last two years by working together more.

They have shared resources in areas such as police training, aviation, data protection and a joint Channel Islands office in Brussels.
It has also been suggested the health departments combine more services, and the two islands open a joint political office in London.
Jersey needs to save £65m by 2013, and Guernsey £31m by 2015.
Jersey's Foreign Affairs Minister, Senator Sir Philip Bailhache, has just returned from a trip to the Channel Islands Brussels Office.
He said: "[The office] gives us the opportunity to engage with movers and shakers in Brussels.
"For Jersey to do it on its own would be twice as expensive as doing it in cooperation with Guernsey, so there are clear advantages in terms of representing ourselves internationally and doing these things together."
Deputy Leon Gallienne, Guernsey's Public Accounts Committee chairman, said: "With the stormy waters that face us globally, the islands need to look to see if we can help each other out on a regular basis."
