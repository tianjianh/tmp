Concern over end of swimming scheme

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The end of a scheme to improve the standard of swimming among primary school children has brought a warning from the sport's governing body.

Scottish Swimming said the government had pulled funding from its Â£1.72m programme to support school lessons.
It said it was concerned it could lead to greater numbers of adults who lacked confidence in the water.
The Scottish government said the top-up scheme had ended but swimming was still well-funded.
Swimming is not a compulsory part of the curriculum in Scotland, unlike in England.
The provision of primary school swimming lessons varies extensively between local authorities, with children living in the most socially deprived areas having the highest number of non-swimmers.
Scottish Swimming claimed that as many as 40% of children, about 15,000 each year, headed to high school as non-swimmers.
Its "Top Up" swimming programme supported local authorities to deliver swimming lessons for pupils.
Scottish Swimming said "Top Up" helped up to 30,000 children to improve their swimming skills.
Sports Minister Jamie Hepburn said: "The Top Up programme was designed to help develop a model to enable swimming clubs and local authorities to teach children to swim by providing some initial additional investment to assist local provision. The programme received Â£1.72m over four years.
"Although the top-up programme has now ended, Scottish Swimming received more than Â£5m (over four years) in the latest funding round from sportscotland. This is the largest funding settlement of all the Commonwealth Games sports."
Shelagh Dow, the head teacher at Granton primary in Edinburgh, said financial pressures stopped many families from going swimming.
She said the loss of the programme would have an impact.
"That is going to make a huge difference for them," Ms Dow said.
"Swimming is ultimately a life skill and because a lot of them don't manage to pick up the swimming with the funded lessons that they have in primary 4 they really need that top-up.  Quite often financial constraints stop them going swimming at other times."
Sharon Macdonald, development officer for Scottish Swimming, said: "It is very concerning for us. The programme has been in place for the past four years.
"We've seen a massive impact from the programme in the region of 25,000 to 30,000 children who have either improved their swimming or become what is our new national standard for school swimming.
