Lincoln City has reached a "financially damaging" agreement with the Co-operative Bank to pay back debts of £370,000, the club's chairman said.

Under the terms of the deal, the club will pay back about £25,000 a year.
The club revealed in February the bank wanted to end its relationship with it as soon as possible, putting its property assets in jeopardy.
Chairman Bob Dorrian admitted he was "very pleased to have finally sorted things out with the Co-op Bank".
"It's financially damaging but it is my belief that it is manageable" Mr Dorrian said.
"Overall, we think it is the best deal we could have got".
Under the terms of the new deal, the club should pay off the debt in 15 years.
The money owed is made up of a £300,000 overdraft and a £70,000 mortgage.
"What we've agreed to do is pay off the mortgage of £70,000, I shall loan the money to the football club to allow that to happen.
"The £300,000 overdraft will now be split."
"The figure is £25,000 a year plus interest and charges, so from that perspective, it's quite onerous, but it does give us a lot of time to get our house in order," said Mr Dorrian.
"We're looking to increase our revenue by at least £25,000 per year and that is the way to counter that problem".
The Co-operative told the BBC it could not comment on individual customer matters.
