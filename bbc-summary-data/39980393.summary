Goalkeeper Tom Heaton has played down speculation linking him with a move from Burnley by insisting he is "more than happy" to stay at Turf Moor.

The 31-year-old, who signed a four-year contract with the club last July, has impressed again this season.
He made his England debut in April and believes staying with the Clarets can help his international chances.
"It is about playing Premier League football and continuing to work at the international set-up," he said.
"I'm delighted to be involved in that and have a taste for it and now I've got a hunger for more. I want to continue improving every day and I'm more than happy where I am at the moment."
Defender Michael Keane has also been heavily linked with a summer move from Burnley, but Heaton is not concerned by the prospect of the club selling players.
"It is the nature of the beast, especially at this level, that when players do well they will get talked about," added Heaton, who joined Burnley from Manchester United in 2013.
"Our biggest strength is our team ethic and our unity. Whatever happens we will deal with it and we'll keep moving forward."
