'UK's first' osprey chick of 2016 hatches at Loch Garten

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
What is thought to be the first osprey chick of the latest breeding season for the birds of prey in the UK has hatched in the Highlands.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The young raptor is being raised by a female and male known as EJ and Odin at Loch Garten, near Grantown on Spey.
RSPB Scotland said the chick hatched at about 07:00 on Saturday and believe it to be the first osprey hatching in the UK this year.
Ospreys migrate from West Africa to breed in the UK and elsewhere.
EJ returned to Loch Garten for her 14th season.
