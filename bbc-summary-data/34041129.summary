The Labour leadership: Welsh angles

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
With just under three weeks to go until the Labour leadership contest, here are some Welsh angles.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
There will be around 50,000 people in Wales voting in the contest.
I'm told the split in the types of voters is the same as the rest of the UK with half being full Labour members, around a third union affiliates and a fifth classed as registered supporters, these are the people who have paid Â£3 to have their say under the new rules which have proved so controversial.
In an earlier blog, I set out who the politicians are supporting. Here's a rough guide: we've spoken to the majority of Welsh Labour MPs and Andy Burnham narrowly comes out on top, above Yvette Cooper. We've also spoken to around half of the 30 Labour AMs and the noticeable difference is the higher number of the Cardiff Bay politicians who support Jeremy Corbyn.
Nine Welsh constituencies have nominated Jeremy Corbyn which is more than any other of the other candidates have received.
An interesting question is whether Labour members in Wales will be more predisposed to vote for Jeremy Corbyn than other parts of the UK, considering that Welsh Labour is often given the tag of being more left wing that the rest of the party.
Insiders have questioned this, pointing to the previous leadership contest when all but one of the Welsh constituencies supported David Miliband rather than his more left-wing brother Ed.
The tag of being more left wing in Wales partly comes from the clear red water comments Rhodri Morgan made when he was first minister to try to separate his government's policies from the Blairite agenda.
Jeremy Corbyn referred to this on a visit to Wales saying he'd hope to narrow the red water or "even walk across it."
But in a column in the Western Mail, Rhodri Morgan responded by saying that rather than being a Corbyn-ite himself, what he was trying to do at the time with those comments was to bridge the mile-wide gap between Tony Blair and the likes of Jeremy Corbyn.
And to illustrate that, claimed that Corbyn was as hostile to what he called classic Labour polices put forward by the likes of John Smith and Neil Kinnock, as he was to Tony Blair.
Another intriguing question is what a Corbyn victory will mean for the assembly election?
It will inevitably throw a sharp focus on events, and Labour's performance in particular.
All eyes will be on Wales, rather than Scotland, where people know the scale of the party's problems, and the London mayoral elections, which is far more wrapped up in personalities, to see what kind of state Labour is in.
The question will be how Labour responds to the inevitable claims from the opposition that it's a party in disarray at Westminster and in meltdown in Scotland.
One Labour insider had a resigned tone when he told me the problem is that the party didn't lose seats like Cardiff north and the vale of Clwyd in the general election because it needed to be more left wing, which will be the inevitable result of a Corbyn victory.
Much of course will be down to Carwyn Jones and Welsh Labour, rather than whoever wins the contest. The current First Minister has already written this month of wanting the freedom to develop a Welsh identity.
He also referred to the old Rhodri Morgan phrase of Welsh Labour managing to blend the guacamole of New Labour with the mushy peas of traditional values. I'm not sure where that foody analogy will stand after September 12.
In the eyes of some, a Corbyn victory may help further cement the identity of Welsh Labour as a party in government, compared with a party of protest, which is what many fear will be the result of him winning.
The flip side is that Jeremy Corbyn has inspired a new generation of Labour voters who are joining for the first time, or returning to the fold, in an attempt to combat austerity measures and make a difference.
When Jeremy Corbyn was in Llandudno recently he spoke about having "uncorked a bottle labelled optimism, we've taken the cork out of and people are excited."
I'll be putting that to the test when I meet a group of Corbyn-ites in a pub in Cardiff this week for a Wales Today feature on the contest. I'll report back in due course.
