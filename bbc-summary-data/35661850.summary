Jamie Donoughue is one of five nominees shortlisted in the best live action short film category for his movie Shok.
Set during the run-up to the Kosovo War, the 21-minute film is the true story of two boys whose friendship is tested to the limits.
Donoughue said being nominated was like being in a "whirlwind".
A former student at Ashville College in Harrogate, Donoughue said the film came about after he found himself unexpectedly stranded in Kosovo in 2010.
"I was a music video director for many years and wanted to move into drama so I went out to shoot a commercial in Kosovo and knew absolutely nothing about the country.
"I went for three days and during that time the Icelandic volcano erupted and I got stuck in the country for five weeks and couldn't get a flight out."
He added: "I met some incredible people who brought me into their families and lives and began to show me what happened and what went on over there.
"I felt I really had to do something to tell some of the stories."
Alongside fellow Leeds producers Harvey Ascott and Howard Dawson, Donoughue spent four years travelling back and forth to Kosovo, finishing the film last year.
The trio have been in Los Angeles since the beginning of the month preparing for Sunday's awards ceremony.
Donoughue said: "It's a bit like a presidential election. You have to lobby the film, go and screen it at events and do meetings and press conferences."
He said he had not had time to think about the prospect of winning and his thank-you speech.
"You only get about 50 seconds and if I had to do all the thank-yous there's no way I could fit it all in.
"I've got all my family ringing saying you're going to have to mention me."
