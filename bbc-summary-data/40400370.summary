[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Armagh proved too strong for Fermanagh in Sunday's Round 1B qualifier in the All-Ireland Football Championship.

The result will come as a relief to manager Kieran McGeeney as he sought to improve on a record of just one win in seven games at Championship level.
Fermanagh did score five points in a row to lead by three in the first half.
But after that, Armagh took command and were 0-13 to 0-7 up when Fermanagh's Eoin Donnelly was sent off after picking up a second yellow card.
The Orchard county, whose Ulster ambitions had been ended by Down at the quarter-final stage, will discover their next opponents on Monday when the draw for round 2B is made.
For Fermanagh, the Championship road ends in disappointment at the Athletic Grounds and there will be speculation about whether Pete McGrath's four-year tenure as manager will be extended.
The Erne county were well beaten 1-20 to 1-11 by Monaghan in the preliminary round of the Ulster Championship and were second best again in this first-round qualifier.
After conceding those five unanswered points, Armagh responded with five of their own from Andrew Murnin, Jamie Clarke, Rory Grugan (2) and Ciaran O'Hanlon.
McGeeney's men led by 0-8 to 0-6 at the interval and then ran away with it in the second period.
Fermanagh had started without top scorer Sean Quigley, although the big forward was introduced as a substitute 11 minutes into the second half.
He did pop over a couple of points but the visitors simply were unable to stem the flow of points coming from the boots of Armagh's Niall Grimley, Ethan Rafferty, Stefan Campbell and star turn Clarke.
Tomas Corrigan was Fermanagh's top scorer with six frees, while Grimley with six and Grugan on five were Armagh's top marksmen.
