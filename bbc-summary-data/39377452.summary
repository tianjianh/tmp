Marc Jones claimed the force spends hundreds of thousands of pounds maintaining the building that should be spent on front-line police services.
He said staff based at West Parade will be relocated to the Â£16m joint ambulance, fire and police station, due to be built at South Park.
The City Centre Neighbourhood Policing Team will move to City Hall, he said.

"We will definitely dispose of West Parade," Mr Jones told BBC Radio Lincolnshire.
"We are spending hundreds of thousands of pounds just keeping the rain out of the leaky roof at the moment and that's money that should be spent on front-line police services.
"Hopefully around March 2019 everybody will move from West Parade to the new station at South Park."
The construction of the new joint ambulance, police and fire station is part of the county's Blue Light Collaboration programme.
On Wednesday, Lincolnshire's Fire and Police services moved into a shared headquarters in Nettleham, in the first phase of the scheme.
