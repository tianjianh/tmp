Swansea's Morriston Hospital would double in size and become a regional centre for specialist treatments.
The city's other hospital, Singleton, would be a centre of excellence for diagnostic and same-day care, working with GPs, opticians and dentists.

It spans six local authority areas, Ceredigion, Pembrokeshire, Carmarthenshire, Bridgend, Neath Port Talbot and Swansea - covering about one million people.

"It breaks free from an outdated healthcare system designed more than 50 years ago and replaces it with an accessible one specifically planned for today's needs, in purpose-built or refurbished accommodation," said ABMU's director of strategy, Sian Harrop-Griffiths.
"It focuses on keeping people healthy, or better managing disease when they're ill."

He said: "The partnership will provide world-class health care delivering skills, talent development and innovation.
"It's really important we start immediately to deliver this project and have a fully integrated service by 2020.
"The aim is to attract the best talent and give people the highest quality of service we can."
Known as Medi-Park, it will set up:
