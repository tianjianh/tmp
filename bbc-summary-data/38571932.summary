The 25-year-old Sunderland winger was carried off on a stretcher in Cairo during his team's defeat by Egypt.
"It's not serious, it's a benign ankle sprain," the federation said in a statement on its website. "He will be able to play in Gabon."
Tunisia will play Senegal on Sunday.
They will also face Algeria and Zimbabwe in Group B at the finals, which run from 14 January to 5 February.
Khazri is one of Tunisia's key players, even though he has had a lack of game time for his Premier League club over the last few months.
