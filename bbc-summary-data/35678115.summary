The incident originated in the Wheatfield stand at Tynecastle.
Both Premiership clubs told BBC Scotland they are aware of a complaint but would not comment further.
"We can confirm we have received a report of racial abuse," said a police spokesman. "Enquiries are ongoing."
It is not yet clear if the episode involves one fan or more.
Northern Ireland international Magennis, 25, is in his second season at Kilmarnock and has scored 10 goals this term.
