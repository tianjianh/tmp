[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
St Johnstone cruised into the League Cup last sixteen with a 4-0 home win against Stirling Albion.

Twice they scored from Liam Craig corners, Steven Anderson and Steven Maclean both heading home.
Craig switched from creator to finisher with number three before half-time with yet another headed goal.
And David Wotherspoon rounded off the victory right at the death as Stirling were outclassed.
It did not take Saints long to assert themselves. Anderson headed in his first goal of the season in the fourth minute with a back post header on the end of Craig's in swinging corner.
And it was another Craig corner which created St Johnstone's second goal 12 minutes before the break. It was flicked on at the near post and Maclean netted with an unmarked header.
Stirling Albion's Bryan Hodge fizzed a 25-yarder a couple of feet too high as they failed to trouble Saints keeper Alan Mannus.
And the Perth team wrapped up their League Cup progression with a third goal in the 43rd minute. MacLean was given all the time and room he wanted to flight a cross for Craig to glance a header past Chris Smith for 3-0.
Keeper Smith picked up what looked like a bad injury in the second half when he fell awkwardly in catching a cross and there was a lengthy delay while he was attended to on the pitch before being stretchered off.
Saints striker MacLean could have helped himself to a hat trick, missing a series of glaring opportunities, but he did lay the ball back for Wotherspoon to round off an easy win, lashing home the fourth goal in stoppage time.
