[SN]TITLE[SN]
Carlisle United 1-1 Accrington Stanley

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Carlisle maintained League Two's only unbeaten record although they were held to a draw by Accrington at Brunton Park.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Billy Kee headed Stanley in front after half-time but former Northampton midfielder Nicky Adams grabbed a share of the spoils for Carlisle with his first goal for the club.
All the early play was in the Accrington half and Danny Grainger came within a fraction of giving Carlisle a 15th-minute lead when, from a short corner by Adams, he crashed a shot against the bar from 20 yards.
Seamus Conneely headed Sean McConville's cross off-target for Accrington but having frustrated Carlisle's attacks up to the break, they caught the home defence napping with a 58th-minute break.
Rommy Boco crossed from the right and Kee headed home virtually unchallenged from six yards for his third goal of the season.
Carlisle drew level in the 65th minute when Adams took a return ball from Charlie Wyke and cut in from the left to fire a low, raking 25-yard shot past Aaran Chapman which found the bottom right corner of the net.
McConville curled a free-kick wide from a dangerous position 25 yards out, but Reggie Lambe could have won it for Carlisle late on when he twice struck the goalkeeper with shots from inside the six-yard box following an Adams ball from the left.
