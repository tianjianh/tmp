The 30-year-old right-back joined Pompey over the summer after being released by Chesterfield.
Talbot, who has made six appearances in all competitions this term, picked up the injury in training last Thursday.
"It's a big blow for us but it's part and parcel of the game," Cook told BBC Radio Solent.
Meanwhile, striker Kal Naismith has been taken off the transfer list at Fratton Park.
