Wycombe Wanderers striker Akinfenwa, nicknamed 'the Beast' and known as the strongest man in football, dropped the 'People's Elbow' on team-mate Luke O'Nien after scoring his second goal in the 3-2 win against Port Vale.
The 'People's Elbow' - an elbow drop - was the signature finishing move of Johnson in his wrestling days.
Johnson praised Akinfenwa's effort, tweeting: "Heart stoppin' elbow droppin'.... well done brotha".
O'Nien joked on Twitter: "Just got out of A&E.  Planning my pay back celebration."
One of The Rock's many catchphrases is: "Do you smell what The Rock is cooking?"
