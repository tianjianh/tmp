Are these England's trendiest offices?

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Apple has announced it is to set up home inside Battersea Power Station, taking over six floors in the central boiler house of the iconic building. It is an impressive structure from the outside, but if Apple wants to keep up with its rivals in terms of style and quirkiness on the inside, the company has its work cut out.

Fellow tech giant Google has London offices in Soho.
There are many unusual features, including a Routemaster bus in one of the rooms, and a chintzy area called the Granny Flat for workers to kick back and relax.

There are even allotments available on the ninth floor for green-fingered employees.
Facebook has office space in Great Portland Estates' Rathbone Square development in Fitzrovia.
It is testing "the latest in workplace productivity technology" - hammock desks.
The social network's office also has communal working areas, table football and indoor trees.
But it is not just the household names who have stylish spaces and innovative thinking.
Software company Citrix has installed "genius benches" at its London headquarters - essentially higher and longer shared desks that come with stools, not chairs.
Perching up there is meant to be more sociable and more stimulating.
Manchester accountancy firm Sedulo has a relaxed approach to meeting rooms, with giant bean bags overlooked by wall art of Steve Jobs.
Also in Manchester is 54 Princess Street, where workers and visitors are met by swings in the foyer.
Duke Studios in Leeds has a "not-bored room", designed to stimulate creativity.
Swings are all very well - but what about slides? Google famously has one at its headquarters in Zurich, but Ticketmaster also has one at its London office.
The entrance to advertising agency Karmarama in Farringdon, central London, is an illuminated tunnel which pumps out a disco music soundtrack. One of the supporting poles in the office is dressed as a yeti.
But playtime is not just for big city companies. Digital marketing agency Sleeping Giant Media in Folkestone, Kent, has a ball pit meeting room.
Whatever Apple does with its new offices, we are likely to see it imitated at companies across the country shortly afterwards.
