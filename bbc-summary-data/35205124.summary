Papers for the meetings of Scottish cabinet ministers throughout the year 2000 are among hundreds of pages of records declassified on 1 January.
Major events included Donald Dewar's death, the start of the Lockerbie trial and the repeal of section 28.
Under the 15-year disclosure rule, archived information is released annually by the Scottish government.
Since it brought in the rule in 2009, more than 13,000 files have been declassified.
One of the central events of 2000 was the death of Scottish First Minister Donald Dewar on 11 October after suffering a fall and a brain haemorrhage.
Known as the founding father of Scottish devolution, the files reveal the impact his death had on the business of government and the parliament.
Other key events that year included the sinking of the Solway Harvester trawler with the loss of seven crew members, and the opening of the Lockerbie bombing trial at a Scottish court sitting in the Netherlands.
Later that year, the Scottish parliament repealed section 28 of the Local Government Act, a law which had prevented the "promotion" of homosexuality by local authorities.
The documents released by National Records of Scotland (NRS) in Edinburgh include papers and minutes for Scottish cabinet meetings and ministerial committee gatherings.
They also shed light on "cabinet strategy sessions" and the progress of various bills through the parliament.
Other files have been made available include the chief constable's annual reports for Stirling and Clackmannan police from 1962-1965 and inspectors' reports for Glenochil detention centre from 1965-1975.
Tim Ellis, chief executive of NRS and keeper of the records of Scotland, said the declassification was a way of "shedding light on the earliest days of the first administration".
Minister for parliamentary business Joe FitzPatrick said the files should make fascinating reading.
"Information made available at the National Records of Scotland as well as the wealth of information pro-actively made available on the Scottish government's website demonstrates this government's ongoing commitment to openness and transparency," he added.
