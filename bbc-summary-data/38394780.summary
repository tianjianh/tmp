The Queen and Prince Philip have cancelled plans to travel to Sandringham on Wednesday because of heavy colds, says Buckingham Palace.

They were expected to take the train to King's Lynn en route to the Norfolk estate to join other royals.
The royal couple are currently at Buckingham Palace.
A palace spokesman said: "The Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh have heavy colds, and so have decided not to travel to Sandringham today."
BBC royal correspondent Nicholas Witchell said the Queen and Prince Philip normally took the train around 11:00 GMT from London, but the delay was "no cause for concern".
He added: "I would imagine they will wish to travel as soon as they feel able to.
"They certainly won't want to miss the family Christmas at Sandringham, so I am sure they will return to their plan for Christmas in a day or so."
On Tuesday, the Queen, 90, and the Duke of Edinburgh, 95, hosted a festive lunch for the Royal family - a tradition they carry out before travelling to their private estate each year.
Prince William was seen arriving with the Duchess of Cambridge, Prince Harry and three-year-old Prince George.
The palace announced on Tuesday that the Queen would be stepping down as the patron of 25 national organisations.
Her patronages will be passed on to other royals, although she will still be patron of hundreds of other organisations.
