Hannah Stewart and Chloe Fitzpatrick both scored doubles as the Dons completed the quarter final line-up a week on from last week's games.
Holders Hibernian Ladies will host Rangers Ladies, and champions Glasgow City will play Stirling University.
Hearts, the only SWPL2 team left in the competition, will travel to Celtic.
Ties will be played on Sunday 26 March.
"A great victory to build on as we approach the start of the league campaign," said Aberdeen head coach Stefan Laird of the win against Glasgow Girls.
"The players worked hard in tough conditions and created enough chances to score more than the four we got."
