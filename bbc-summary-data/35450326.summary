The Spaniard has made 48 appearances since signing from Espanyol for Â£2.5m in June 2013.

"This is my home. I am happy here and my family is too," said Amat, 23.
"It's great news and I'm so happy to sign a new extension.
"I've been here for two and a half years and I'm very happy to be here for another three years."
