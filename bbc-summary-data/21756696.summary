Litvinenko suspect rules himself out of attending inquest

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A former KGB officer suspected of killing Alexander Litvinenko says he will not attend the UK inquest into the Russian spy's death.

Russian MP Andrei Lugovoi told a Moscow press conference he could not receive "justice" in Britain.
Mr Litvinenko, 43, died in 2006 after he was poisoned with polonium-210 while drinking tea at a London meeting.
A pre-inquest review heard he was working alongside Spanish spies for MI6 in the days before his death.
Russia has refused to extradite Mr Lugovoi to the UK for questioning. He has also denied any involvement.
It was thought he might have provided video-link evidence to the inquest in London.
But a spokesman for the inquest said: "It is too early to say whether Mr Lugovoi will be called to give evidence and, if he is, how it would be given."
Mr Lugovoi reportedly told the press conference, which was hosted by the Russian news agency, Interfax: "I have no hope to get justice in the UK. I finally lost faith in the possibility of an impartial investigation of the case...

Andrei Lugovoi was almost mocking in his criticism of Scotland Yard and the British government at the press conference. He condemned the 'politicised fantasy of London detectives' who had written 'drivel' in their report into Alexander Litvinenko's death.
The last hitmen the Russian state had despatched abroad to murder political opponents had been, he said, in Stalin's time.
Mr Lugovoi presented himself as totally innocent, a crusader for transparency and justice. He was even prepared, he said, to travel to London - but, crucially, only after the accusations against him are dropped. Lugovoi knows they won't be, so a trip to Britain in the near future seems out of the question.
Russia has refused to extradite him. What's more, Moscow has given the distinct impression it has been trying to protect him.
A year after Alexander Litvinenko's death, Mr Lugovoi was included in the party list of a Russian nationalist party. He was duly elected to the State Duma and received parliamentary immunity from prosecution.
"I have to say that I'm out of the coroner's investigation and I will not participate in it."
It has been claimed that Lugovoi and another former KGB agent, Dmitry Kovtun, poisoned Mr Litvinenko at the Millennium Hotel in London's Grosvenor Square.
The inquest is due to formally open on 1 May.
Last month, coroner Sir Robert Owen ruled that sensitive evidence alleged to expose Mr Litvinenko's ties to MI6 will be examined in secret.
He has said he will examine what was known of threats to Mr Litvinenko's life and also whether the Russian state was responsible for his death.
He has also agreed that a group representing Russian state prosecutors can be accepted as a party to the inquest process, which would allow it to cross-examine witnesses and examine evidence.
British Government documents that implied Russia was behind the 43-year-old's death were also revealed. Moscow has denied any involvement.
Sir Robert will also hold a hearing on Thursday, in which he will hear applications for anonymity of witnesses and will consider submissions on the inquest timetable.
