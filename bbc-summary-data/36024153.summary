[SN]TITLE[SN]
Dempsey Nibbs found guilty of beheading wife Judith Nibbs

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man has been found guilty at the Old Bailey of beheading his common-law wife at their east London flat.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Crane driver Dempsey Nibbs killed Judith Nibbs, his partner of 30 years, after he suspected her of having affairs, the court heard.
Nibbs, 69, of the Charles Estate in Hoxton, had denied murder.
Judith Nibbs, 60, was described as "bubbly and happy". She had confided in her sister and a colleague that her partner had threatened to kill her.
During the trial, Crispin Aylett QC, prosecuting, said the couple's relationship had soured in the spring of 2014 as Mr Nibbs suspected his partner of infidelity.
During a row on 7 April, she had taunted Mr Nibbs with details of her infidelities, saying: "I have had sex eight times."
On the night of 10 April, Mr Nibbs attacked her in their Hoxton flat and knocked her out, Mr Aylett said.
"Having attacked his wife, the defendant then took up a kitchen knife and cut off her head," he said.
The court heard how Mr Nibbs disposed of remains down the lavatory, before writing a suicide note to his son and ringing police to tell them they would find "a couple of dead bodies" at his home.
