FA Cup predictions: Lawro v BBC Breakfast host Bill Turnbull

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
BBC Sport's football expert Mark Lawrenson is pitting his wits against a different guest each week this season.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Lawro's opponent for this weekend's FA Cup fifth-round ties is BBC Breakfast presenter Bill Turnbull.
Turnbull, who is stepping down from his role at the end of this month, has been a Wycombe Wanderers fan since their remarkable run to the FA Cup semi-finals as a third-tier team in 2001.
"I started going with my two sons towards the end of that run and we went up to Villa Park for the semi-final against Liverpool," Turnbull told BBC Sport.
"That was us tied in then. We were glory-hunters in effect - but we have been waiting for the glory to come around ever since."
Turnbull is not predicting any shocks this weekend but thinks League One strugglers Shrewsbury will do the lower leagues proud when they host Manchester United on Sunday.
"I think United will be in for a bit of a surprise there," Turnbull explained. "They might slip up a little."
Football Focus presenter Dan Walker will be stepping into Bill's shoes on BBC Breakfast.
You can see Dan and Lawro on Focus, live from Vicarage Road, on Saturday at 12:10 GMT on BBC One and the BBC Sport website.
* Away team to win at home in the replay
Our scoring system has changed this season and a correct result (picking a win, draw or defeat) is now worth 10 points. The exact score earns 40 points.
Last weekend, Lawro got three correct results from 10 Premier League matches, with no perfect scores.
His score of 30 points saw him beat Deadpool actor Ed Skrein, who picked six correct results but no perfect scores for a total of 60.
All kick-offs 15:00 GMT unless otherwise stated
This is the third year in a row that Arsenal have played Hull in the FA Cup, and a repeat of the 2014 final, and I think it will also be the third year in a row that the Gunners end up on top.

It is an attractive tie for Hull, but they are top of the Championship and promotion is their priority - they can see the pot of gold.
So I am not sure what kind of team Tigers boss Steve Bruce will pick, because he will not want a replay.
We saw the quality of Arsenal's squad with Theo Walcott and Danny Welbeck both coming off the bench and scoring important goals against Leicester.
I don't see the manner of that win as being a turning point in the season because I was backing Arsene Wenger's side to win the title anyway, but it will definitely boost their belief that they can do it.
Lawro's prediction: 2-0
Bill's prediction: Arsenal are at home and flying high in the Premier League. They will keep their cup defence going too. 2-0
Match preview
Reading are not going to get promoted out of the Championship and, despite only one win in their last nine league games, they do not look like they will get relegated either.

West Brom ended their own poor run with a battling win against Everton at Goodison Park last weekend.
I am sure Baggies boss Tony Pulis will juggle his squad to some extent but I don't think a cup run will damage their survival prospects, because I don't think they are going down anyway.
Lawro's prediction: 1-2
Bill's prediction: This is a tricky one for the Baggies. 1-1 (West Brom to win the replay)
Watford got a really good win at Crystal Palace last time out and their form has really picked up again since they lost four in a row at the turn of the year.

Leeds are doing OK in the Championship, but again are nowhere near promotion.
They seem to be bringing some good young players through but they are selling them on. That is great for their bank balance, but it is not going to get the club back in the top flight.
There will be a lot of Leeds fans at Vicarage Road and there should be a great atmosphere, but I am backing the Hornets to go through.
Lawro's prediction: 2-0
Bill's prediction: This one looks fairly straightforward for Watford. 2-1
Both teams lost at home in the Premier League last weekend, with Everton edged out by West Brom and Bournemouth being completely unhinged by Stoke.
I'm going to go for a result which I think neither side will want, which is a draw and a replay.
Lawro's prediction: 1-1
Bill's prediction: Everton will squeak it. 0-1
I think everyone has realised that West Ham are a very good team - now they just have to keep going.

The Hammers also have an outstanding individual player in Dimitri Payet but, even when he is out, they are still a decent side.
They have also come back late in a few games which shows they have resolve to go with that quality.
I will be at Ewood Park to watch this one - Blackburn ended a nine-game wait for a Championship win when they beat Fulham on Tuesday, but I don't see them getting another win this weekend.
Lawro's prediction: 1-2
Bill's prediction: West Ham are playing very well at the moment. 0-2
Palace still cannot buy a Premier League win. They have gone nine matches without a victory in the league and they can barely manage a goal - they have only found the net four times in those games.
Tottenham looked impressive in their win over Manchester City last weekend and I don't think their trip to Italy to play Fiorentina in the Europa League will bother them.

Spurs boss Mauricio Pochettino has shown with their results already this season that he has a squad that can cope with European competition without affecting domestic form, and I am backing them to get another win on Sunday.
Pochettino's side do not create loads and load of chances but they are very hard working and, even with Jan Vertonghen out, they are still very difficult to break down.
Lawro's prediction: 2-0
Bill's prediction: I saw Tottenham's win over City and they were absolutely fantastic. 2-0
I was in Paris to watch Chelsea play Paris St-Germain in the Champions League on Tuesday and they played pretty well despite losing the first leg of their last-16 tie.

Chelsea boss Guus Hiddink might be missing one or two players through injury, but it looks like Manchester City might be missing more for other reasons.
We are not sure what sort of team their manager Manuel Pellegrini will put out because of how close this game is to their trip to play Dynamo Kiev in the Champions League on Wednesday night.
Pellegrini says he may field a weakened team at Stamford Bridge. If he does, it will be a shame because it is not great for the FA Cup, but you can understand why.
Lawro's prediction: 2-1
Bill's prediction: Chelsea are still unbeaten domestically in 11 games under Guus Hiddink but City have lost their last two games and I don't see them losing three in a row. 0-1
This tie is all about the romance of the FA Cup and it will be a great night for Shrewsbury and their fans, whatever the result.

Regardless of the team that Manchester United boss Louis van Gaal puts out, they will be too strong for League One opposition.
The FA Cup has been in the news this week with the talk that replays that could be abolished.
It is not surprising that Shrews boss Micky Mellon spoke out against that suggestion because, as he said, a replay at a place like Old Trafford is a financial lifeline for clubs like his.
Maybe, if we do get a scenario where there are no longer replays, when the draw comes out the smaller team gets the choice whether to host the match.
If they do, they have a greater chance of an upset, or they can choose to go to the bigger club's stadium and get a guaranteed windfall instead.
Lawro's prediction: 0-2
Bill's prediction: I have got to go with the lower league club to get something here. 1-1 (Man Utd to win the replay)
Lawro was speaking to BBC Sport's Chris Bevan.
Lawro's best score: 160 points (week 19 v Guy Mowbray)
Lawro's worst score: 20 points (week one v Graeme Swann & week 23 v Ice Cube and Kevin Hart)
