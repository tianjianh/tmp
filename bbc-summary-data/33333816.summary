Belfast: Paris firm Stargime submits plans for £20m office redevelopment

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A Paris-based property firm has submitted plans for a £20m redevelopment of a Victorian bank building in Belfast city centre.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Stargime has bought the former First Trust bank building at Queen's Square that has been vacant since 2013.
It intends developing 80,000 sq ft of grade A offices.
The company has said it is at an "advanced stage" of negotiations with a tenant that is considering leasing the entire building.
The scheme will involve retaining the listed Victorian part of the building and demolishing the 1980s extension.
Jonas Mallard, a director at Stargime, said that, if approved, the scheme will create offices of "an international standard" that will enable a large international firm to invest in Belfast.
He said the development would also "breathe new life" into a landmark building and the surrounding area.
Stargime is an international property development company established in the mid-1980s.
It bought the Queen's Square building for £2m, which is its third investment in Belfast.
In 2013, it bought Arthur House, a retail and office property on Arthur Street, for £5.8m.
It also owns Artola House and an adjacent building on Victoria Street that it also plans to redevelop for offices.
Belfast currently has a shortage of grade A office space as there was little new development in the years after the property crash.
