CalMac deploys replacement service after pier collision

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Ferry operator Caledonian MacBrayne is to redeploy a ferry from Arran in an effort to ease problems on its Islay routes.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
It follows a collision involving the MV Hebridean Isles last month with Kennacraig pier on the Mull of Kintyre.
Since then the repairs needed to ferry have resulted in Islay being left with a single vessel.
CalMac said it would also move another vessel to become a 24-hour service to ease disruption for travellers.
The MV Finlaggan will run an overnight freight service between Islay and Kennacraig for large vehicles such as caravans and camper vans, as well as her normal daytime timetable.
The changes will take place from Monday night.
