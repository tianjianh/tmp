Chief executive Peter Lawwell says Celtic will aim to add one more player to their squad before the transfer window closes next Wednesday.

Lawwell was speaking after Celtic were drawn against Barcelona, Manchester City and Borussia Monchengladbach in their Champions League group.
"Before we qualified, we discussed the squad and the requirements for Brendan [Rodgers]," he told BBC Scotland.
"We'd like to add one more before the deadline. We'll do some work on that."
Lawwell, who said "nothing can be guaranteed" about a new arrival, praised Rodgers for the "remarkable" job he has done since taking over in June.
"Brendan has got off to a great start," he said. "He's been really fantastic and it's been quite a remarkable first couple of months for him.
"To achieve what he has done in such a short space of time has been remarkable.
"He's an outstanding manager. Hopefully, he'll be with us for a number of years and take our great club forward."
Rodgers, who replaced Ronny Deila in the summer, guided his side through qualifiers against Lincoln Red Imps and Astana before a 5-4 aggregate win over Hapoel Beer Sheva in the play-off.
Celtic will open their group campaign away to Barcelona in the Nou Camp on Tuesday, 13 September, before hosting Manchester City on 28 September.
They then face home and away games against Monchengladbach on 19 October and 1 November before tackling Barcelona at home on 23 November and concluding away to City on 6 December.
Lawwell quipped: "It could've been easier. There's some real glamour ties in there.
"It's where we should be. It gives us the financial upside but also the opportunity to increase our profile. The prestige of the tournament gives us a platform to show people what Celtic are and tell the story."
Celtic have played Barca in the Champions League eight times over the past 12 years, famously beating them 2-1 in Glasgow in 2012.
In recent seasons, the Scottish champions have made several signings from Manchester City, including current defender Dedryck Boyata and winger Patrick Roberts, who joined on an 18-month loan deal in January.
"We know Barcelona very well from the last few years," added Lawwell.
"City, we've got a great relationship with and I believe Monchengladbach are a great side as well, so there are great nights ahead at Celtic Park."
