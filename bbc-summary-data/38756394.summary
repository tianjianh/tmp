Stornoway Coastguard help give whale health check

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A coastguard helicopter crew took film footage of a humpback whale off the Isle of Lewis following concerns that the animal was in distress.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Stornoway-based crew was training in the area where the whale was spotted west of Lewis earlier this week.
It was thought the whale was entangled in rope, or another object.
Members of British Divers Marine Life Rescue were later able to reach the whale by boat and found it to be swimming strongly and healthy.
