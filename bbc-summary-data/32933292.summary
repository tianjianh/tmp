Addil Haroon, 19 and from Rochdale, claimed he drove from Leeds to Rochdale in 11 minutes on the M62 on 8 November.
The following day he killed another driver Joseph Brown-Lartey, 25, when he drove at 80mph on a residential street.
The attorney general will review Haroon's six-year prison sentence after complaints it was unduly lenient.
Haroon caused Mr Brown-Lartey's Audi A5 to split in half when he sped through a red light and crashed into him at the junction of Bury Road and Sandy Lane, Rochdale, at 04:40 GMT.
Mr Brown-Lartey died at the scene.
It happened hours after Haroon, of Essex Street, took a photograph of the speedometer while speeding on the motorway in a hired Audi A6.
He sent it in a Snapchat message to a friend which read: "Leeds to Rochdale 11mins catch me."
Leeds to Rochdale is trip of about 34 miles.
Haroon pleaded guilty to causing death by dangerous driving and driving without a licence or insurance.
Sgt Paul Higgins, of Greater Manchester Police (GMP), said experienced traffic police officers described the crash scene as the "worst" they had ever seen.
The attorney general's office said: "We have been asked to consider whether Addil Haroon's sentence is unreasonably low, under the unduly lenient sentence scheme.
"The attorney or solicitor general will make a decision by 25 June as to whether the case should be referred to the Court of Appeal."
