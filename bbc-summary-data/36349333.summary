Peaty, who also claimed mixed relay gold earlier in the week, won gold in Tuesday's 100m final and added the 50m title as he came home in 26.66 seconds.
Ross Murdoch, who won 200m breaststroke gold on Thursday, claimed the bronze.
Earlier, Fran Halsall defended her 50m backstroke title as she broke a six-year European Championship record, while Georgia Davies won bronze.
Peaty, who also did the 50m-100m double at the world championships in Kazan last year, recorded the same time as the semi-final win after finishing strongly following a slow start.

"I over-thought the start and paid for it with the time, but it's great to win," Peaty, 21, told BBC Sport.
"It's a bit slap and dash and you can put too much thought into it, which is what happened there with the start.
"But it's great to get some confidence before the Olympic Games in Rio with a win."
Halsall, who claimed the 50m backstroke title in Berlin in August 2014, won with a time of 27.57, which knocked 0.07 seconds off Aliaksandra Herasimenia's 2010 time in Budapest.
Denmark's Mie Nielsen finished second ahead of Halsall's Great Britain team-mate Davies, who came third in 27.87.
Italy's Federica Pellegrini won a fourth successive women's 200m freestyle gold. The 27-year-old, who won the Olympic title in 2008, was 0.04secs quicker than Femke Heemskerk of the Netherlands, who had led at the final turn.
