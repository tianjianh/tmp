Nicky Clark, Nicky Law and David Templeton will leave Rangers when their contracts expire at the end of May, the club have announced.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Winger Templeton, 27, is the longest-serving Rangers player of the trio, having joined in 2012.
Forward Clark, 24, and midfielder Law, 28, arrived the following year.
Rangers wished the players "every success in their future careers, and thanks them for their efforts during their time at the club".
Former Hearts player Templeton helped the club win the fourth tier in his first season and all three players were involved as Rangers won Scottish League One in 2014 and the Championship this term.
Clark, who netted more than 20 times for the Ibrox side, was previously with Queen of the South while Law joined Rangers from Motherwell.
