[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Everton strengthened their grip at the top of Group H as they eased to an easy Europa League win over Lille.

Leon Osman celebrated his new one-year contract extension by firing home from eight yards after Aiden McGeady's cross had evaded James McCarthy.
McGeady was involved in the second before the interval, Phil Jagielka finding the net with a header following the former Celtic winger's corner.
Steven Naismith added the third from Leighton Baines's low cross.
Roberto Martinez's side head into their final two group games in pole position to qualify for the last 32 after passing their French test with flying colours.
The Toffees have eight points from four games, one more than Wolfsburg, who hammered Krasnodar 5-1 and who Everton visit on 27 November.
Win in Germany and Martinez's side can start planning for the next round with one game to spare.
It was fitting that Osman, who has served the first team for almost 12 years, should find the net hours after it was announced that the 33-year-old will remain at Goodison Park until at least the summer of 2016.
The hosts had already gone close through Romelu Lukaku when Osman gave Vincent Enyeama no chance after lashing home McGeady's 27th minute cross into the danger area.
Everton were vibrant and creative as they constantly probed the French defence in what was one of their best Goodison displays of the season.
Tim Howard had to be alert to stop Ryan Mendes from scoring when the game was goalless but other than that the Toffees defence was rarely troubled.
Lukaku spurned a great chance to double the lead when he headed wide before unmarked England defender Jagielka showed the Belgian how to score with a 42nd minute bullet header after another excellent delivery by McGeady.
Lille were a shadow of the team that had frustrated the Toffees in northern France two weeks earlier.
The busy Lukaku forced Enyeama into a fine finger-tip save to keep out his 54th minute free-kick before Naismith sealed the points in front of his watching international manager Gordon Strachan.
Naismith, named in the Scotland squad for the forthcoming European Championship qualifier against the Republic of Ireland and the England friendly, produced an emphatic finish from eight-yards after Leighton Baines's cutback.
That was Baines's ninth assist of the campaign while Everton are now unbeaten in five league and cup matches, their season gathering momentum.
Everton manager Roberto Martinez:
"We played with a maturity that suggested we had been playing in Europe for years.
"What pleased me the most was that every player was ready and embraced the chance to play in Europe.
"We started the game really brightly and in the first three actions we showed we could open Lille up.
"We were very strong defensively against a strong attack. Then going forward we always looked a threat."
