An historic house and 13 acre (5.5 hectare) estate has been put on the market in Conwy county which follows its closure as a convalescent home in 2008.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Queen's Lodge, Colwyn Bay, was the home of the first Lord Colwyn. It became two care homes following the death of Frederick Henry Smith, an industrialist and banker, in 1946.
Its grounds included a lake, croquet lawn, bowling green and award winning gardens.
The sale price has not been revealed.
It was bought by the former Merseyside Hospitals Council, a health insurance scheme, in 1946, according to the National Monuments Record of Wales.
People from Merseyside used the estate for recuperation, sending postcards to family and friends bearing pictures of the main house and grounds.
Queen's Lodge became the John Braddock Convalescent Home while the Mary Bamber Convalescent Centre was built in the grounds.
Colwyn Bay Heritage Group said Queen's Lodge was an important building as the former home of Lord Colwyn and his family who became "great benefactors of the town".
Agents Legat Owen said the whole site had potential for a range of uses.
