County Championship: Tim Bresnan gives Yorkshire hope of lead over Middlesex

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Tim Bresnan and Andrew Hodd shared a vital century stand to give Yorkshire hope of a first-innings lead against leaders Middlesex at Lord's.

The hosts were bowled out for 270 in the morning with Nick Gubbins departing for 125 as Jack brooks claimed 6-65.
Toby Roland-Jones' fiery spell saw him remove Alex Lees, Gary Ballance and Andrew Gale for ducks as Yorkshire collapsed to 32-3.
But Bresnan (72*) and Hodd (64) led Yorkshire to 235-6 at the close.
With Somerset looking on course to win at Taunton against relegated Nottinghamshire, both Yorkshire and Middlesex need to win if they are to clinch the title.
Yorkshire need to score at least 350 in 110 overs of their first innings and win if they are to retain the Division One trophy, while bonus points are no longer relevant for Middlesex.
Bresnan's brilliant opening spell - which saw him dismiss Gubbins and James Franklin (48) as he took 2-5 in seven overs for figures of 3-48 - set up a fascinating day under bright skies in London.
Although Middlesex edged past 250 and collected a second batting bonus point, Brooks removed the tail to ensure Yorkshire took all three bowling bonus points.
However, the White Rose county's vulnerable top-order was again exposed as Roland-Jones bowled Alex Lees before Ballance and Gale were both guilty of poor shots as they were caught in the slips.
When Steven Finn bowled Adam Lyth for 43 it brought Bresnan to the crease, batting at five for the first time in his career, and his 116-run fifth-wicket stand with Hodd frustrated the Middlesex bowlers.
Roland-Jones trapped Hodd lbw for 64 late in the day, but Bresnan reached his fifth half-century of the season to leave Yorkshire trailing by just 35 runs, although the new ball is only 11 overs away.
