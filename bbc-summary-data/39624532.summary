Charlie Holt, five, was caught between a wall and a table as the popular Sun Dial Restaurant in Atlanta revolved on Friday.
The rotating floor automatically shut off and restaurant employees were able to free the child.
But Charlie suffered a head injury and was taken to hospital, where he died.
The family, who were visiting from North Carolina, released a statement on Saturday, asking "for prayers and privacy right now to come to terms with this tragedy".
"No words can express their loss. If you have a loved one, please give them an extra hug today," the statement read.
Police told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution the boy died at Grady Memorial Hospital on Friday.
Sgt Warren Pickard called the incident "very tragic".
"I simply think he lost sight of his parents and panicked," he said, "and found himself in that situation.
"A small child doesn't know what to do in those moments."
Gustavo Anzola, who witnessed the incident, told the newspaper as many as six people worked to free the boy, who eventually lost consciousness.
"A few seconds later, he fell into his dad's arms," Mr Anzola said.
Police said the investigation is ongoing and the restaurant will remain closed until further notice, according to a spokesperson.
The Sun Dial offers panoramic views of the city on the 72nd floor at the Westin Peachtree Plaza.
The boy's death is not the first fatal accident at the hotel.
Last year, a 61-year-old employee died after she was locked in a walk-in freezer.
