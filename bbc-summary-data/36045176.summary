The proposals, drawn up by Rail Central, would see a depot built on up to 700 acres of farm land between Milton Malsor and Blisworth.
Ashfield Land, the developer behind the scheme, says it would boost the economy with 8,000 jobs.
Many villagers say it would cause traffic problems, ruin the countryside and end the rural community.
The plans include offices, a service depot, facilities for heavy goods vehicles and a hotel. Some homes would also face compulsory purchase orders.
The scheme was first revealed in January but the planning application has not yet been submitted.
It is set to be submitted directly to the planning inspectorate, bypassing the council's planning committee, because it is deemed to be a nationally important scheme.
Councillor Ann Addison, who represents Milton Malsor on South Northamptonshire Council, said: "We know what's happening on the ground we know what local people's feelings are, I don't know if an inspector who comes up from wherever (will)."
In a statement Ashfield Land said the plans would create a "world-class logistics hub" in the county that would contribute to the regional and national economy.
The statement added the firm was in the early stages of developing the proposals and there would be a consultation on the process in the coming weeks.
