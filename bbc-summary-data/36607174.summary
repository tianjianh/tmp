The bout will be the unbeaten 26-year-old's first defence of the title he claimed from Charles Martin on 9 April.
"It's just another fight - we just happen to have a belt," Joshua said.
The 2012 Olympic gold medallist, weighing in at 17st 4lb, faces 18st 2lb American Breazeale, who has 15 knockouts in his 17 victories.

Breazeale, 30, is also unbeaten but failed to progress past the first round in the weight category that Joshua dominated at the London 2012 Olympics.
In the final news conference before the fight, the Briton said that he was intent on securing "an explosive KO and entertaining everybody".
Joshua has knocked out all 16 of his professional opponents, with compatriot Dillian Whyte the only man to take him past three rounds.
Despite saying he was going to "crush Breazeale's dreams" before giving himself the moniker "the dream-crusher", Joshua admitted he did not know what he was going to face and was expecting "a real tough fight".
"I'm looking at winning this fight in good style so I can unify titles some time way down the line," he added.
The fight tops the bill on a big night of British boxing at the O2.
