Farming in harmony: Northern Ireland farmers protecting wildlife on their land

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Richard Kane classes himself as an intensive farmer.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
He has hundreds of acres of wheat and barley on his land near Limavady in County Londonderry.
He also grows 130 acres of oilseed - that's the fields of yellow flowers you will see dotted around the countryside at present.
He presses the seed to make a high-quality cooking oil.
All the work is done on his farm at Broighter Road.
Richard is conscious of the criticism directed at farmers for their impact on the countryside.
But, like many others, he is doing his bit to work in harmony with the environment.
Oilseed is an excellent crop for wildlife. It takes a long time to grow and provides good cover for birds, like pheasant, and wild hare.
That, in turn, attracts buzzards and sparrow hawks. And Richard sees lots of lapwings, which is a priority species in Northern Ireland.
But it is in his spraying policy in relation to the oilseed where he has really changed his approach.
"We have insecticides for aphids that can devour the crop but we've stopped using them in the last two to three years," he said.
"We usually use them to protect the crops, but unless we actually see the aphids now, we don't.
"We've stopped to protect bees, because farmers were getting a lot of blaming on the bee numbers.
"If we have to use them now we do it at dusk when the bees have gone back to their hives."
Richard also has a resident barn owl.
The RSPB has given him several owl boxes which he has put up, and plans to do a species audit.
Across Binevenagh mountain in Ballymoney, County Antrim, Brian Knipe is a dairy farmer with an interest in wild birds.
He has two acres of wild bird cover which is sown every year with a mix of barley, wheat and even sunflowers.
It is allowed to flower and seed, and provides cover and food in the winter.
Brian also has a large pond that he dug out years ago to provide a home for waterfowl.
He said many farmers quietly do similar work on their land.
"Farmers aren't inclined to shout about what they do, and I'm glad of their opportunity to say on their behalf that this is what goes on on lots of farms.
"Yes, we could be growing grass or other things, but we do do our bit for wildlife."
He said he enjoys nothing more than watching the wild ducks walk their ducklings the three-quarters-of-a-mile from his pond to the river Bann.
And he said 10 minutes watching the dragonflies on a summer's morning can be a welcome distraction from the stresses of farming.
Both Richard Kane's Broglasco farm and Brian Knipe's Vowgrave farm areopen to the public on the weekend of 13-14 June as part of Open Farm Weekend.
