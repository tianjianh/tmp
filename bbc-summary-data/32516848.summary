Election 2015: The weird world of hustings

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
With less than a week to go before polls open, candidates are more desperate than ever to win the backing of voters and one of the key battlegrounds is local hustings. Dozens of these events are being held up and down the country - and some of them can get a little weird. Here's a few examples:

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
1. Berwickshire, Roxburgh & Selkirk  The hustings in Selkirk earlier this week looked relatively normal at first sight - a hall packed full of locals on plastic chairs. But on closer inspection, one of the seven candidates courting voters appears to be wearing a helmet and body armour. His name? Jesse Rae, a pop star turned independent politician. The video for his 1985 hit Over The Sea is a "classic".
2. Lichfield  When Conservative candidate Michael Fabricant was unable to attend hustings in his constituency, organisers filled his chair with a blond wig atop a large tree branch. Any similarity with the well-known Tory is for you to decide, not us...
3. Uxbridge & Ruislip South  Another candidate who missed a hustings event was Boris Johnson. He was replaced by a life-size cardboard cut that was placed rather unnervingly beneath a large cross on the wall of Yiewsley Baptist Church.
4. Cities of London & Westminster  Hustings are a great way for candidates to get some attention, particularly if they're from one of the smaller parties. So maybe it shouldn't be a surprise that Adam Clifford of the Class War Party turned up to St Mary-le-Bow Church in knee-high stiletto boots. It certainly makes you look twice.
If you've seen anything out of the ordinary at your local hustings, let us know!
