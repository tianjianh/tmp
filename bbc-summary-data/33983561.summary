In pictures: Australia's water babies

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Australians are water babies.  Most of them live near the coast and the beach is where many people go to relax and play.

But the nation's love of water extends further. The backyards of Australia's red-brick suburbs are dotted with swimming pools; in country towns, rivers take the place of beaches; and everywhere you can find recreational fishers.
A photography exhibition that opens next month in Sydney shows how deeply embedded this water world is in the national psyche, with many of the images depicting scenes of swimmers, sailors and bathers.
The City of Sydney's 'Australian Life' photography competition asked entrants to submit "their unique take on what Australian Life means to them", says Lord Mayor Clover Moore.
The work of 22 photographers from around Australia who made the finalists' list will be displayed on a giant scale in the middle of Sydney's Hyde Park from 18 September.
There are an estimated 800,000 registered recreational boats in Australia - yachts, cruisers, fishing boats and tin boats with outboard motors - not to mention those that aren't registered. But not all of them head out into unsheltered ocean waters to confront the elements.
Australian children are generally strong swimmers, learning at school from an early age how to do the famous "Australian crawl" or free-style stroke. The surf isn't for the faint-hearted.
Australia has one of the highest pool ownership rates per capita in the world, with about 12% of the population living in a home with a pool.
Sun-baking and sporting the latest bikini fashions are also part of the beach scene.
Not everyone was enamoured of beach culture. Entrants included photos of Muslims at prayer, suburban and inner-city living, and military veterans pausing during an Anzac Day parade.
There is life beyond the beach but many people still choose to enjoy the outdoors whether it be coffee on their balconies, picnics in the park or playing sport outdoors.
The make-up of Australia's population has changed over the decades thanks to a long history of overseas migration. More than one in five people resident in Australia was born in another country.
