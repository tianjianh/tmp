Yilmaz Vural, 62, managed the side for six days and one away league game which they lost 2-0.
Genclerbirligi have 13 points from 17 matches and are 16th in the 18-team Super Lig.
Ilhan Cavcav, president of the Ankara-based club, has appointed 51 different coaches since taking over in 1981.
Turkish media reported Vural was sacked after asking to sign players in the mid-season window, a request Cavcav rejected saying the squad was big enough.
