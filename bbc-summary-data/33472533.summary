Jim and Anne McQuire, from Cumbernauld, were among the 38 people shot dead at a resort near Sousse two weeks ago.
A funeral service has been held at Abronhill church, where the couple had been well-known members of the congregation.
Their son Stuart said they would be "sorely missed."
In a family statement, he added: "They were a couple devoted to each other and who lived to enjoy life.
"They spent their lives contributing so much to the community. Through their many interests they made many friends and helped many causes within and outwith the church.
"On behalf of myself and the family, I would like to thank everyone for their kind words, cards and messages. It is overwhelming the support we have had and that so many people have been touched by these tragic circumstances."
Mrs McQuire, who was 63, sang and played guitar at Abronhill church while her 66-year-old husband helped hundreds of young people over many years as captain of the 5th Cumbernauld Boys Brigade company.
The couple were cremated at Daldowie Crematorium in a private ceremony following the church service.
The minister at Abronhill, the Reverend Joyce Keyes, who led the funeral service, described Mr and Mrs McQuire as "kind, thoughtful and unassuming people".
She said: "We are going to miss them tremendously for the things they did. More importantly, we are going to miss them as people. They were really good to have around, and that is what we will miss most.
"The BB was the main focus, but all of the youth work - they were very thoughtful of young people and their needs, and how they could help them.
"I can't begin to imagine how many families have been affected in this community by the passing of Jim and Anne."
Thirty of the 38 victims of the attack on 26 June were British. Three Irish nationals, two Germans, one Belgian, one Portuguese and one Russian also died.
They were killed when Tunisian student Seifeddine Rezgui opened fire at tourists on sunloungers outside the five-star Hotel Rui Imperial Marhaba.
Rezgui, who is believed to have been helped by a number of other people, was shot dead by police.
On Wednesday, all British nationals were urged to leave Tunisia because "a further terrorist attack is highly likely".
The funeral of the other Scottish couple killed in the attack, Billy and Lisa Graham, from Bankfoot near Perth, will be held on Monday.
