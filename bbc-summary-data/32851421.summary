The 60th anniversary Eurovision Song Contest, which was watched by 10,000 people in Vienna's Stadthalle and a further 200 million on TV, was a typically colourful night.

Sweden's Mans Zelmerlow celebrated winning this year's contest with his song Heroes. It is the sixth time Sweden has won the competition.
Zelmerlow's performance included the clever use of animations projected on the stage, helping him to amass a total of 365 points.
Dozens of Swedish fans cheered on their compatriot in the Austrian capital.
The show was hosted by Alice Tumler, Mirjam Weichselbraun, Arabella Kiesbauer and last year's winner, Conchita Wurst.
Guy Sebastian represented Australia, which was invited to participate to celebrate Eurovision's 60th anniversary. He finished in a respectable fifth position with 196 points.
It was an emotional night for Russia's Polina Gagarina, who ended up in second place after leading the field for a time.
Italian pop opera trio Il Volo were among the fan favourites going into the competition and finished third.
Latvia surprised many commentators, with Aminata's Love Injected finishing sixth.
Lithuania's Monika Linkyte and Vaidas Baumila (left) and their backing dancers created one of the memorable moments with a performance that included a three-second kiss.
Serbia's Bojana Stamenov lifted the crowd with her pop anthem Beauty Never Lies. The song had been expected to do well after the semi-finals, but finished 10th.
Despite their elaborate staging and light-up costumes, UK entry Electro Velvet were awarded a total of just five points from Malta, Ireland and San Marino.
Germany's Ann Sophie looked glum during the voting and failed to score any points - the first time a country has received the infamous "nil points" since 2003.
There was disappointment too for the home country's entry The Makemakes, who also failed to pick up a single point.
