The England Under-21 international has regularly been linked with Premier League sides, including Liverpool, since making his Rams debut in 2011.
Hughes, 19, played 48 games last term as Derby reached the play-off final.
"He is a promising young talent and we're looking forward to working with him over the next few years," said Rams boss Steve McClaren.
Hughes, who joined County as an academy scholar in 2011, was encouraged to stay with the Rams by Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers when the teenager was linked a move to Anfield in November 2013.
He scored four times last season and was named in the PFA's Championship team of the season.
Hughes is the fourth player to commit to the club in the past week, following Jake Buxton, Craig Forsyth and Jeff Hendrick.
