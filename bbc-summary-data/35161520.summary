An overturned car which became the subject of a tongue-in-cheek social media campaign has been removed from a roadside after six weeks.

The white Vauxhall Corsa prompted a satirical response as it languished in a ditch at Ludgvan, near Penzance.
Facebook users even lobbied for the upside-down vehicle to be granted Unesco World Heritage status - an accolade usually reserved for globally-renowned landmarks.
It has now been removed.
As doubts grew over whether the car would be gone before Christmas, supporters of the campaign posted doctored images of it draped in a festive jumper and wrapped in fairy lights.
Other images featured children's book character Where's Wally peeking out of the driver's window.
Posting on Facebook, Trish Boase said she was "feeling emotional" after the Corsa's departure.
"Sadly I just witnessed our beloved monument being removed. It is no more," she wrote.
Devon and Cornwall Police said it was the responsibility of the local authority to clear the car from the ditch alongside the A30.
Cornwall Council said it worked with the police and the car's owner to remove the car.
