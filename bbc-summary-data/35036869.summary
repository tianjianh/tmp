Pregnant woman with breast cancer 'must have baby early'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A pregnant woman who chose to delay intensive chemotherapy rather than abort her baby has been told she must have the child 12 weeks early to stand the best chance of surviving.

Police officer Heidi Loughlin, 33, from Portishead, near Bristol, found out she had inflammatory breast cancer when she was 13 weeks pregnant.
She has had chemotherapy but has found out the initial treatment has failed.
Once the baby is born she can take stronger drugs to target the cancer.
Ms Loughlin, a serving officer with the Metropolitan Police, who has two boys aged one and two with her partner Keith Smith, said she was initially told if she chose to postpone any type of chemotherapy she would die.
She decided to have the less aggressive chemotherapy to give the baby the best chance.
"It was never an option  - I'd already bonded with the baby," said Ms Loughlin.
The birth had been scheduled for New Year's Eve but after the chemotherapy failed doctors said the risk to her was so big it was better to bring the birth forward.
"I've been told I really need to start Herceptin (cancer drug) now.
"Nobody wants to ever be in this position and all the options are awful but I need to be here for all my children so the birth will be this Friday," she said.
Simon Cawthorn, a breast care consultant at North Bristol NHS Trust, said the type of cancer Ms Loughlin had was "very responsive" to the drugs, which she would be given once the baby was born.
"There's reason to be optimistic - Herceptin has been a major breakthrough for this type of inflammatory cancer," he said.
The drug cannot be given to Ms Loughlin while she is pregnant as it would kill the baby.
Pete Wallroth, who set up the Mummy's Star charity to help pregnant women with cancer, lost his wife to metastatic breast cancer two months after she had given birth to their second child in 2012.
He said women being diagnosed with cancer during pregnancy can find it "devastating".
"It tips the entire situation on its head, at a time when there is normally great celebrations.
"It's great to hear in Heidi's case the clinical decision around bringing the birth forward has been done in full consultation with her," he said.
He said the Mummy's Star charity was supporting nearly 200 women and their families around the UK.
