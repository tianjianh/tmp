[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The owner of a dog that mauled an 11-month-old baby to death has been found guilty of owning a banned breed.

Ava-Jayne Corless was attacked while sleeping at a house in Blackburn, Lancashire, in February 2014.
Lee Wright, 27, had denied the claim his pet, called Snoop, was a banned pit bull-type that contravened the Dangerous Dogs Act 1991.
At Blackburn Magistrates' Court, Wright was warned he was facing jail and will be sentenced later.
District Judge Gerald Chalk asked for a pre-sentence report to be obtained.
The judge agreed there was no evidence to suggest Wright had known the dog was of a prohibited breed.
He said both expert witnesses had relied on the American Dog Breeders Association as standard in making their assessment of the dog, but said it was "comment rather than definitive".
Wright had disputed the pet was a banned pit bull type dog in contravention of the Dangerous Dogs Act 1991, saying he believed it to be an American pit bull.
Ava-Jayne was killed in February 2014 at the defendant's house on Emily Street, Blackburn, as her mother Chloe King and Wright - her then-boyfriend - slept.
They believed the dog was in the kitchen blocked in by a speaker and a golf bag stand.
Police said at the time the dog - which was destroyed after the attack - had been identified by experts as a pit bull terrier-type.
During the two-day trial, expert witness Peter Olsen, a retired veterinary surgeon, had examined the dead dog and concluded it shared a "substantial number of characteristics" with a pit bull.
But veterinary surgeon and animal behaviourist expert Elizabeth Kendal Shepherd said she was "unable to form any reliable opinion" about the dog's breed.
