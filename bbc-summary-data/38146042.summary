Steadman, 23, missed out on PT4 triathlon gold at Rio 2016 after taking a wrong turn in the swimming stage.
And she is now moving to the city where Olympic champion Alistair and his silver-winning brother live.
"I just think it's time to refresh things that have perhaps got stuck in their ways," Steadman said.
She told BBC Look East: "It's just to start a new chapter, to get some different perspective on coaching styles, improve my techniques in the three individual sports and I think it will be best done in Leeds.
"I'll try to give Jonny and Alistair a run for their money."
