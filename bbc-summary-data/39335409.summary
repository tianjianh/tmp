An Australian police minister says he did not realise he was breaking the law when he picked up his mobile phone while driving.

Troy Grant, a New South Wales MP, was stationary when he took a photo, which he later tweeted from home.
After being alerted to the illegality, Mr Grant reported himself to police to face a A$325 (Â£203; $250) fine.
"This serves as a massive reminder. Nobody is above the law even if you are the police minister," Mr Grant said.
The minister had been stopped at roadworks when he photographed a car carrying a sheep in front of him.
"I did not know that what I was doing was against the law," Mr Grant said on Tuesday.
"This is a great lesson for me, and I hope it is something that the community takes a lesson from as well."
Under the state's law, drivers may operate a phone only from a fixed cradle without contact.
