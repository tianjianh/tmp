Flintshire's first crematorium gets go-ahead after inquiry

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The first crematorium to be built in Flintshire has been given the go-ahead after a public inquiry.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A planning inspector has ruled Memoria Ltd should be allowed to build one on land near the village of Northop.
These plans were rejected by Flintshire council over road safety concerns and the visual impact of the building.
Inspector Vicki Hirst concluded that none of the objections raised during the inquiry outweighed proposals put forward by the company.
Objections were also raised by people in the area and a funeral director whose application to build a crematorium at another site in Northop was rejected in 2014.
Oxfordshire-based Memoria will need to meet strict conditions, including carrying out road widening near the site, before construction work can begin.
