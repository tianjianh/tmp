Worcester Warriors have made Bath lock forward Will Spencer their third signing for the 2016-17 season.

Hampshire-born Bath Academy product Spencer, 23, follows the signings of centres Ben Te'o from Leinster and Jackson Willison from Grenoble.
"Will is a hungry young second rower who will add vital competition to the pack," said Warriors director of rugby Dean Ryan.
"We're looking to help him realise his potential here at Sixways."
Spencer will be reunited with Bath team-mate Tom Heathcote, who is in his first season as Warriors' first-choice fly-half.
"From speaking to Dean and Tom, Worcester feels like the right place for me to further my career over the next few seasons," said Spencer. "There is a great young squad at the club.
"Hopefully, over time, we can achieve our goals and become a top Premiership side."
Meanwhile, Worcester look like they could be without first-choice scrum-half Jonny Arr for the rest of the season.
Arr was an unexpected absentee for Saturday's last-gasp 32-22 defeat at Wasps. But it has now emerged that he has suffered a lateral media knee ligament injury - and Ryan predicts that he will be out for "three to four months".
After joining the Bath Academy in 2010, Spencer made the transition to Bath's first-team squad in 2014 and has since made 11 appearances.
The 6ft 7in forward spent a season on loan at London Welsh in 2013-14, playing a part in the Exiles' Championship-winning campaign.
His current contract with Worcester's Premiership rivals Bath was due to expire at the end of the 2015-16 season.
