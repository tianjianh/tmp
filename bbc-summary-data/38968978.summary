A motorbike racer was killed when his front tyre burst and caused a high-speed crash during practice for the TT races, an inquest has heard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Paul Shoesmith, from Poynton, Cheshire died from multiple injuries after the crash on Sulby Straight on 4 June 2016.
The inquest heard a "catastrophic" and "unforeseen" tyre failure led the 50-year-old to lose control of his machine at more than 160mph (250km/h).
Coroner John Needham recorded a verdict of misadventure at Douglas courthouse.
Riding a different bike, Mr Shoesmith had set his fastest-ever lap of the TT course and finished 29th in the Superbike race on the morning before the crash.
Race marshal Joseph Bevans said Mr Shoesmith would have been travelling at between 160 and 190mph through what is one of the fastest parts of the Mountain Course when his tyre burst.
Mr Bevans said he saw the front tyre lift about 12in (30cm) after Mr Shoesmith rode through a depression and then explode when it came back into contact with the road.
The coroner said the crash was "inevitable" after the tyre burst.
Two witnesses described how the experienced racer became parted from his motorbike and hit a kerb and tree.
Recording his verdict, Mr Needham said the bike had passed race control ahead of the solo practice session and Mr Shoesmith had been "ultimately responsible" for the selection of the tyre.
The father of four made his TT debut at the event in 2005.
He achieved his best result of 15th in both the Superbike and Senior races held in 2011.
The coroner said he had died "pursuing his dream".
