Casey was 11 under after 12 holes when play was suspended in Napa, California, in round two, three behind Piercy.
The 39-year-old was out early on Saturday to complete his round and managed to close the gap after a birdie on the par-five 16th hole.
However, Piercy responded with a birdie on the 17th to maintain a strong lead over Casey and USA's Johnson Wagner.
Scotland's Martin Laird is tied fifth, six shots off the lead.
