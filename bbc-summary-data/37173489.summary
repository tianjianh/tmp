They flew back to the UK from Rio last week, with Davies picking up a silver medal and Joyce losing out in the bronze medal match.
Signs have gone up in their home towns of Bancyfelin in Carmarthenshire and St Davids in Pembrokeshire congratulating them on their achievements.
Davies' sign was made by Llanelli rugby legend Delme Thomas.
He was helped by former Newport Gwent Dragons Director of Rugby, Lyn Jones.
Scarlets flanker Davies, known as Cubby, tweeted: "If I ever write a book, Rio would be a decent chapter, in more ways than one."
Jasmine Joyce arrived back in St Davids last week and was greeted by signs in Solva and outside her former school Ysgol Dewi Sant in St Davids.
She tweeted: "Absolutely amazing support from family and friends. Can't thank everyone enough."
She even found time to make a guest appearance for Haverfordwest Ladies RFC in a rugby sevens tournament on Saturday, scoring a try in the final.
St Davids Rugby Club will be organising a special homecoming event on Friday to celebrate the city's first ever Olympian.
