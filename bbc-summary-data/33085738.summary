Dublin: Man dies and another is critical after sewer accident

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man has been killed and another has been critically injured in a workplace accident in a sewer in County Dublin.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
They were carrying out maintenance work on the sewer system at a housing estate in Portmarnock at the time of the accident on Wednesday afternoon.
Dublin Fire Brigade officer Gerry Stanley told Irish broadcaster RTÃ‰ that one of the men fell into the sewer pit.
Mr Stanley said when one of the man's colleagues attempted to assist him, he, too, got into difficulty.
They were rescued from the pit and brought to Beaumont Hospital, where one man remains in a critical condition.
Three firefighters involved in the rescue were also taken to hospital "as a precaution", but have since been discharged.
