[SN]TITLE[SN]
Another weekend of RMT strikes on ScotRail

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
RMT union members working for ScotRail have started another two days of strike action.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A number of services on Saturday and Sunday will be cancelled or reduced, although ScotRail has claimed that 76% of routes will operate as normal.
The industrial action is over the union's concerns about trains operating without guards.
On driver-only-operation trains, the driver is asked to close the doors at stations, instead of a conductor.
ScotRail has said it would ensure a second member of staff was scheduled to be on board every train to assist the driver in emergencies.
However, the company has accepted there are occasions when a ticket examiner does not turn up for work that a train could run with only a driver and Scotrail has said it has union agreement for this.
The union believes the absence of a dedicated guard would make trains less safe.
ScotRail has predicted that this weekend's strike will not affect services to Troon, where the Open golf championship is being held.
