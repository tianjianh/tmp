Both acts received the same number of votes from the 144 DJs and pundits who create the list, which highlights the most exciting new acts in music.
"It's scary and exciting," said Mura Masa - whose Asian-themed electronica has been championed by Huw Stephens and Jo Whiley, "but it's an honour".
The full top five will be revealed on BBC Radio 1 throughout the week.
Pop trio Years and Years topped the poll last year, with previous winners including Adele, Ellie Goulding, Sam Smith and Haim.
WSTRN have already scored a UK top 10 hit with their debut single In2, a feel-good seduction song that's attracted celebrity support from the likes of Wretch 32, Lily Allen and Rita Ora.
Released in the same week as Adele's Hello, it was at one point outselling its rival before eventually charting at number four.
Their name is a play on the word Western - referencing their upbringing in Shepherd's Bush and Hammersmith, West London.
After the success of urban acts from the capital's east (Wiley, Rudimental) and south (Tinie Tempah, Stormzy) "we're saying it's the West's turn," Louis Rei told the BBC.
The singer said it was "humbling" to be included on the Sound of 2016 list.
"When I heard we were on the list, I slept like a baby," added Akelle.
Mura Masa is the stage name of 19-year-old Alex Crossan, who describes his sound as "lo-fi oriental-influenced beat music".
He grew up on the island of Guernsey, where "being removed from any particular music scene" helped inform his genre-defying style.
DJ Annie Mac, who voted for Mura Masa, called him "intimidatingly talented for someone of his age".
The Sound Of... list launched in 2003, and has a track record in championing new and innovative acts, many of whom have gone on to achieve global success.
According to the rules, the acts should not already be well known to the UK general public - through featuring in the final stages of a TV talent show, for example, or having already been a member of a successful band.
They must also not have been the lead artist on a UK top 20 single or album before 30 October 2015 - although guest vocalists are eligible.
