Elia joined Quins on a short-term deal in December, but did not play a game for the club last season.
The 21-year-old has won three Test caps for Samoa, having made his debut against France in November 2016.
"Elia showed in his short time at Harlequins last year that he is a talented young player," director of rugby John Kingston said.
