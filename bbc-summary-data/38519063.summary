Swansea Hospitals Radio was created by school friends Rob Rees, David Vaughan and Clive Thomas.
It started out as Radio Glantawe at Morriston Hospital and grew to become Radio City based at Singleton Hospital.
Six founding members will visit their old studios on Saturday before a gathering in Mumbles.
They include Private Eye journalist Tim Richards, barrister Ieuan Rees, former Bishop of Swansea and Brecon Tony Pierce and GP turned international sports broadcaster Dr Robert Treharne Jones.
"We've lost many founder members but it will be fascinating to get people from the original group back together again to celebrate such a significant anniversary," said Dr Treharne Jones, who organised the reunion.
When the radio station began, it offered a full programme of news and music to patients on weekday evenings and all day at weekends.
Speaking on BBC Radio Wales, Dr Treharne Jones said the Glantawe Hospital management committee showed "great entrepreneurial spirit" in allowing young boys from Dynevor School to start a radio station.
"I was just 15 years old when we started," he said.
"We joined forces with Glanmor Girls' School - both schools have long since closed - and we were given free rein to manage our own programming.
"Not only did we have the chance to go on air for the very first time, but also a chance to go around the wards and speak to the patients and gather record requests."
He said his involvement in the station helped his application for medical school.
"It gave us our first opportunity to have a public audience and get our first steps on our career ladders," he added.
