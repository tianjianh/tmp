[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Speaker John Bercow has praised SNP MPs for their "solidarity" - a day after rebuking them for clapping.

The SNP benches have been packed as its 50 new MPs pour into the House of Commons for each maiden speech.
Mr Bercow praised the practice after Edinburgh East MP Tommy Sheppard's first remarks to the Commons.
He had previously told the MPs to "show some respect" after they broke Commons tradition by clapping their Westminster leader Angus Robertson.
The Speaker said: "I know I'll be joined by a great many colleagues in admiring the spirit of solidarity which motivates large numbers of members of one party to turn up at the same time.
"I say that in a spirit of genuine respect and so thank you for what you have said."
The SNP won a record 56 of Scotland's 59 seats at the general election.
During the first day of the Queen's Speech debate on Wednesday, Mr Bercow scolded the SNP group for clapping Mr Robertson.
He urged the delegation to respect the long-held ban on clapping in the Commons chamber - despite the rule sometimes being ignored.
In his maiden speech, Mr Sheppard offered an explanation for the incident.
He said: "Mr Speaker, you gave us a gentle rebuke yesterday for the applause we gave in this chamber.
"We take that with good grace. We know, of course, it is not traditional practice in the chamber but we didn't know just how unacceptable it might be found. We will refrain from doing that again.
"It will take us time to learn the processes that work here, it will take us time to get our feet under the table and it will take you time to get used to us. But I hope we will be able to do that in the weeks and months ahead."
The SNP group has begun calling "hear hear", as is traditional in the Commons.
