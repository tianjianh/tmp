Married couple discover WW2 coincidences of their fathers

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A married couple, born thousands of miles apart, have revealed how they discovered their fathers had an unlikely wartime connection.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Ed Heron is originally from Montreal in Canada while his wife Brea is from Newry, County Down.
The couple met in the 1960s in Lincolnshire, where they were both teaching.
They would later discover that many years before, there was a good chance that their fathers had encountered each other while fighting in World War Two.
The Newry couple have shared their series of remarkable coincidences on Time of Our Lives, a BBC Radio Ulster programme about the life stories, experiences and ambitions of older people in Northern Ireland.
Brea's father, Cyril Wiltshire, was killed in France in July 1944, fighting for a Welsh regiment.
While his name was on a memorial in Bayeux, her family did not know where he was buried.
In the 1980s, Ed and Brea travelled to France in a quest to find her father's grave.
Having visited many cemeteries and looked at hundreds of headstones, their investigations led them to a grave simply marked: "21st July, 1944."
They had a feeling that this was where Brea's father Cyril was buried.
In one of many coincidences, the man who buried him also lived in Newry.
While he was reluctant to talk about his experiences in the war, he was able to say who had been killed alongside Brea's father.
Once they knew these names, they knew they had the right cemetery.
All this searching prompted Ed to get in touch with his father and ask him about his experiences in the war.
It turned out he had also fought in France at the same time and on the very same spot - Hill 12 - where Brea's father had been killed.
The Canadians had been on one side of the hill, the Welsh on the other.
The whole thing became a "very spiritual adventure," says Ed.
On one of their visits to France, they discovered that a friend from Newry had bought a house there.
It turned out that it was the place where the soldiers had met to attend Mass before going into battle.
Ed and Brea are sure her father would have been one of these soldiers.
Brea's mother had her late husband's diaries and letters, including a half-written one that was the very last he wrote before being killed.
Time of Our Lives, with Colum Arbuckle, is broadcast on BBC Radio Ulster and Radio Foyle at 14:03 BST on Sunday
