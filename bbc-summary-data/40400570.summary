Pakistan posted their highest World Cup score with opener Nahida Khan (79) helping them to 206-8.
The Proteas reached 113-0 before losing five wickets for 34 runs in a frenzied spell which included three run-outs.
It was left to number nine Shabnim Ismail to strike consecutive boundaries in the 49th over to secure a win.
Pakistan, who have not won a World Cup match since 2009, face England on Tuesday, again at Leicester, while South Africa play New Zealand at Derby on Wednesday.
