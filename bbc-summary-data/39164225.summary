[SN]TITLE[SN]
Guiseley 1-0 Aldershot Town

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Aldershot's 11-match unbeaten run came to an end as Jordan Preston's solo effort secured victory for Guiseley.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Preston struck nine minutes into the second half to hand the Shots their first National league defeat since December 17.
Home goalkeeper Jonathan Maxted produced a fine save to tip Shamir Fenelon's close-range effort on to the crossbar as Aldershot had the better of a goalless first half.
But the hosts took the lead nine minutes into the second period when Preston's forceful run ended with him slotting past Jake Cole.
Cole produced a fine save to prevent Will Hatfield making it 2-0 soon after, while Aldershot were denied an 81st-minute equaliser when Jake Gallagher hit a post.
