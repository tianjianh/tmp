Halfway mark passed in 24-year photo project

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Those of you who have followed my ramblings for some time will know that at this time of year I like to catch up with the 24 photography project, which involves 24 photographers capturing the first 24 hours of a new year for 24 years.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Each photographer is assigned an hour of the day in which to shoot their picture, wherever they are in the world. The original 24 photographers met while studying at Central Saint Martin's in London, though some have now left the group and been replaced by others.
Claire Spreadbury, the founder of 24photography, said: "The exhibition is going from strength to strength and now in our 13th year we've really developed an identity and feel that we're an established part of London's art calendar."
This year's show has been curated by Brian Harris, who is well known for his work on the Independent and the Times. He said: "This was a challenging brief well executed by 24 completely different photographers over a 24-hour period of time, giving us 24 different ways of seeing our world. I thank them all for opening my eyes to yet another way of seeing."
Here is a selection of images from the project, on show in Soho Square, London, until 18 March.
You can see more images from the series on the group's website www.24photography.org/.
