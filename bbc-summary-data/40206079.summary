A farmer whose disappearance led to "overwhelming" offers to help his family bring in the harvest took his own life, a coroner has ruled.

Andrew Green was 33 when he went missing in June 2016.
He was last seen driving away from his family's Yew Tree Farm in Chorley, near Bridgnorth, Shropshire.
At Shrewsbury Coroner's Court on Thursday, coroner John Ellery recorded a verdict of suicide.
About 100 members of the public helped search for Mr Green in September 2016, with his parents a month earlier also receiving offers to help on the farm.

His mother Julie Green said then that the offers - made via social media - to help harvest a remaining 60 acres had "overwhelmed" the family.
The body of Mr Green, who had been going through a relationship breakdown, was found in March 2017.
