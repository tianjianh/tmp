AI creates gallery of nightmare images for Halloween

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
If AI did not already have a bad enough reputation, scientists at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology are now teaching a machine how to be terrifying.

The Nightmare Machine turns normal images of faces and familiar landmarks into darker versions of themselves.
Members of the public are then being invited to vote for the scariest AI-generated faces.
Doing so will "help our algorithm learn scariness", the scientists said.
"Creating a visceral emotion, such as fear, remains one of the cornerstones of human creativity," writes the team.
"This challenge is especially important in a time where we wonder what the limits of artificial intelligence are  - can machines learn to scare us?"
Last year, scientists at Google ran a similar experiment - dubbed Deep Dream - in which everyday images were converted into psychedelic visions.
As well as being a bit of fun in the lead-up to Halloween, the MIT project illustrates how far AI research has come, said Quartz magazine.
"The two main techniques used in the project, style transfer and generative adversarial networks, were published in papers only last year," writes Dave Gershgorn.
"Now the technology is easy enough to implement in a novelty project made by just three computer scientists."
