The disappearance of a man presumed murdered remains a mystery, four years after he went missing.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Kyle Vaughan, from Newbridge, Caerphilly county, vanished on 30 December 2012.
Gwent Police searched extensively for the 24-year-old and made several arrests without any success.
Mr Vaughan's family received a presumption of death certificate from the High Court earlier this year.
Det Ch Insp Nikki Brain said: "Four years on and the investigation to find out what exactly happened to Kyle that night remains ongoing.
"From day one my team has been committed to supporting Kyle's family throughout this very difficult time, and we remain focused on solving this case and providing some much needed answers to them."
On the night Mr Vaughan disappeared, his damaged silver Peugeot 306 was found abandoned on the A467 between Risca and Crosskeys.
It had been in a crash but it is not known whether he was driving it at the time.
Police believe Mr Vaughan, known to his friends as Jabbers, walked away from his car but it remains a mystery what happened to him after that.
A missing person's inquiry was launched, which rapidly became a murder investigation.
But all those arrested in connection with his disappearance were later released without charge.
