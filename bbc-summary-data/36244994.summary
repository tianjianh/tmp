[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Our correspondent, producer Maria Byrne and cameraman Matthew Goddard were stopped by officials on Friday as they were about to leave North Korea.
He was questioned for eight hours by North Korean officials and made to sign a statement.
All three were held over the weekend but have now been taken to the airport.
The BBC team was in North Korea ahead of the Workers Party Congress, accompanying a delegation of Nobel prize laureates conducting a research trip.
The North Korean leadership was displeased with their reports highlighting aspects of life in the capital.
