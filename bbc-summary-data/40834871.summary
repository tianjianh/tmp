[SN]TITLE[SN]
Blackpool 1-0 Milton Keynes Dons

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Sean Longstaff's early strike was enough to secure newly-promoted Blackpool their first victory back in League One and defeat MK Dons.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The game was played with Blackpool Air Show taking place in the skies above Bloomfield Road and the hosts were soon flying high.
They were ahead after just five minutes when on-loan Newcastle midfielder Longstaff picked the ball up 15 yards out and rifled a right-footed shot low into the far corner.
And the Seasiders had a chance to double the lead when Bright Osayi-Samuel broke inside the area but his square ball to Viv Solomon-Otabor was poor and the chance was lost.
MK Dons had their best chance after 36 minutes when Ethan Ebanks-Landell rose highest to glance a header from six yards inches wide of the far post.
The visitors had goalkeeper Lee Nicholls to thank for keeping them in the game as he twice denied Osayi-Samuel from close range after 74 minutes.
And his opposite number Ryan Allsop secured Blackpool the points by parrying away Kieran Agard's fierce late drive.
