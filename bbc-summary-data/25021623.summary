Rome ancient frescoes reignite debate over women priests

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The reopening of a labyrinth of catacombs in Rome has reignited a debate over women priests in early Christianity.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Women's groups say frescoes on the walls at the Catacombs of Priscilla are evidence that women occupied the role of priests in ancient times.
A major clean-up operation that took five years has revealed the images in greater clarity.
But the Vatican has dismissed them as pure "fable, a legend".
The catacombs - discovered in the 16th Century - are famous for housing the oldest known image of the Madonna and Child dating from around  AD230-240.
They were originally built as Christian burial sites between the Second and Fifth Centuries and stretch 13km (8 miles) over several levels.
But two rooms in particular have been a source of lively debate for years.
In one, known as the Cubiculum of the Veiled Woman, there is an image of a woman with arms outstretched as if saying Mass.  She is wearing what some say are garments worn by priests.
In another room, known as the Greek Chapel, a group of women sit at a table with arms outstretched and celebrating a banquet.
Organisations promoting a female priesthood, such as the Women's Ordination Conference and the Association of Roman Catholic Woman Priests, say these scenes are evidence of a female priesthood in the early Church.
Fabrizio Bisconti of the Vatican's archaeology commission said the fresco of the woman was "a depiction of a deceased person now in paradise", and that the women sitting at the table were taking part in a "funeral banquet".
The Vatican has restricted the priesthood for men and teaches that women cannot become priests because Jesus willingly chose only men as his apostles.
