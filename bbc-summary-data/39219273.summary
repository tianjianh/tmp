[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Cheltenham Town boss Gary Johnson says he will accept a one-match touchline ban and a £500 fine from the Football Association following his conduct in Saturday's draw at home to Mansfield.

Johnson, 61, was sent from the dugout after Cheltenham had a player sent off.
"It is probably best to hold your hands up and say 'ok'," Johnson told BBC Radio Gloucestershire.
"I've got a one-game (ban) and a £500 fine, a normal sentence for a manager sent to the stands. I accept that."
