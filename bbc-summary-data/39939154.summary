The 23-year-old, who spent three years with Dungannon, signed for the Mallards in 2016 after a spell with Dergview.
"From the minute I left I've always wanted to get back here - I feel I can bring a lot to the Swifts," Mayse told the Dungannon website.
Mayse scored 10 goals for Ballinamallard last season.
"I'm delighted with the signing of Ryan," said Dungannon manager Rodney McAree.
"I've known him for a long time and he'll be a terrific addition to the squad. He is a very talented player with an eye for goal - I can't wait to start working with him in pre-season."
Mayse's exit from Ferney Park comes five days after the Fermanagh club signed midfielder Richard Clarke from Crusaders.
