Network Rail and Merseytravel will invest in new stations and new rolling stock to provide more frequent services and improve reliability.
The plan will also include improvements to Liverpool's Lime Street Station and the re-opening the Halton Curve, linking Liverpool to North Wales.
The work is expected to take three years to complete.
It will include:
Merseytravel Chairman Councillor Liam Robinson said that while the projects would mean "significant changes to how people make their journeys", he hoped to "minimise disruption to residents, visitors and business".
The improvements are part of Network Rail's nationwide Railway Upgrade Plan to upgrade tracks and stations in response to increased demand for services.
They will pave the way for additional services, such as planned new First Transpennine Express services from Liverpool to Glasgow in 2019, and new Liverpool to Chester services.
