Mark Footitt: England call 'feather in Derbyshire's cap', says Welch

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Pace bowler Mark Footitt's former club Derbyshire deserve credit for his England call-up, says Graeme Welch, the county's elite performance director.

Uncapped Footitt, 29, took 76 wickets in 16 County Championship matches for Division Two Derbyshire in 2015 before signing for promoted Surrey in October.
He will join England for the tour of South Africa, which starts in December.
"Realistically, that is a feather in our cap more than Surrey's," Welch told BBC Radio Derby.
"Mark had a lot of injuries, for which they (Derbyshire's medical staff) gave him individual programs, strengthened him in certain areas, and kept him on the park, so I'd say it was a team effort from everybody.
"We're all on the same hymn sheet and I think Mark benefited from that management team.
"I wish him all the best and I'm sure he'll do well."
