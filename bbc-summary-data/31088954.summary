Tinder, berry 'crack' and venison jerky - how to survive in 10,000 BC

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Reading this on your phone, not on a cave wall, might be a bit of an early fail in terms of recreating life in the Stone Age.

Channel 5's new reality show 10,000 BC is aiming to do exactly that, with contestants spending two months living like early man.
Armed with ceramic pots, walking boots (our feet have evolved) and animal hide to protect their dignity, the group were left to fend for themselves in the countryside of Bulgaria.
Here are few tips we picked up.
You will need: Nettles, cedar bark and patience.
You can never have enough rope or tinder for a fire so make sure you pick up anything you see that might come in useful.
If you're not too familiar with the term "cordage is king" then you probably wouldn't last too long.
Cordage is rope and is used for making everything from clothing and traps to containers and weapons.
Survival expert Adam Hendley, who worked on the show, admitted "it's a fiddly skill to get to grips with" but the basic plan is to twist plant fibres together to make them stronger.
Here's Ray Mears' guide to cordage making.
You will need: Cordage, A LOAD of tinder and again, patience
Fire starting is another essential skill for Stone Age man that hasn't necessarily been passed down the generations.
With no lighters or matches, the 10,000 BC cast had to try out that method only the boy scouts know - rubbing sticks together.
The key is preparation. Make sure you have enough wood to burn and it's not too breezy.
No need for Ray this time, Newsbeat's Nesta McGregor can guide you through his Stone Age transformation.
You will need: Berries, herbs, fish... basically anything you can find that won't kill you or that you can kill. Plus, the strength not to eat everything you find.
Adam Hendley told Newsbeat that after spending 30 years training in bushcraft, a modern-day man will only have skill set of a Neanderthal toddler.
The Stone Age diet for the cast of 10,000 BC consisted of berries - mainly cranberries, blueberries and sloe berries.
They were apparently nicknamed "crack" during the series because everyone got a bit addicted due to the lack of any other sweet stuff.
Venison became an ancient form of jerky and - by reducing the fat and adding it to berries - a greasy form of Kendall mint cake. Yum.
You might also see a lot of fishing in the show as well as a bit of duck hunting.
The crew told Newsbeat ducks would not have been in that part of the world in the Stone Age - but that they couldn't stop the cast hunting what was available.
Here's Ray again, this time explaining foraging and how to pick the right food.
We use his survival buddy Bear Grylls but his menu isn't exactly for the faint-hearted.
Also he's been busy teaching the likes of Max from The Wanted and Jamelia how to survive in his new show Mission Survive.
10,000 BC starts at 10pm on Channel 5 on Monday 2 February and Tuesday 3 February, with two episodes each week.
A spin-off show focussing on the younger members of the group will also be shown on MTV during the series.
