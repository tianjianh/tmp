West Midlands: Three things you wanted to know

You wanted to know how the A500 in Stoke-on-Trent got its nickname the "D Road".
You also asked whether Shropshire was the most "loosely populated" county in England.
And we looked into what was going to happen to a landmark Coventry tower block. Here's a look at how we got on with answering your questions.
The A500 is the main A-road through Stoke-on-Trent, connected to the M6 at both ends and, as this BBC article from a few years ago says, it's known locally as the "D Road".
City historian, Fred Hughes, said it was known by that nickname "virtually from when it was opened".
He said the name came from the shape of the road which, when you take into account the M6, is like the letter "D".
The short answer is "no", at least based on estimates from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) - the last census was carried out in 2011.
The ONS last published population density estimates in 2015. Its figures (which are for 2014) are broken down by local authority area, rather than by ceremonial counties.
According to these estimates, the most loosely populated local authority area is Eden in Cumbria, with just 25 people per square kilometre. The data records Cumbria as a whole as having a population density of 74 people per square km.
Under the estimates, the Shropshire Council area, by comparison, has 97 people per square km, while the Telford and Wrekin area has a population density of 584 people.
Based on the 2013 figures, the government produced this interactive map.
Civic Centre 4 - as it's officially known - has been sold by the council to Coventry University, although they are still leasing the building.
The plan is to develop the site, along with three other civic centres - creating a new facilities complex.
