[SN]TITLE[SN]
Gun-toting raider Taylor Wright lodges appeal over jail term

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An armed robber who threatened to shoot an 80-year-old woman in her Borders country cottage has lodged an appeal against the length of his sentence.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Taylor Wright, 21, was jailed for five years and 10 months at the High Court in Edinburgh last month.
Appeal details emerged at Jedburgh Sheriff Court when he appeared for sentence on other outstanding charges.
His lawyer asked for sentence to be put on hold pending the appeal but it was deferred until Thursday.
Wright was jailed in August after he admitted assaulting and robbing 80-year-old Sheila Turnbull in her Yarrow Valley home.
He armed himself with a spray-painted BB gun which his victim believed was real and robbed her of cash and a bank card after getting her to reveal her PIN number.
Wright has appealed against the length of the sentence he received for that offence.
That came to light while he was appearing for sentence on a number of outstanding offences including breaking into a carwash premises where he used to work and stealing a cash register and a vehicle.
