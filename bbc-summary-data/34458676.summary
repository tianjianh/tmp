McAuley Precision and McAuley Fabrication are expanding resulting in the creation of the skilled manufacturing jobs.
Invest NI chief executive Alastair Hamilton said the jobs would be created over the next four years.
He said it was "positive news" for Ballymoney and the "local manufacturing industry".
McAuley Precision and McAuley Fabrication supply machine and sheet metal components for the transportation, oil and gas and aerospace industries.
Invest NI has offered McAuley Precision £500,000 and McAuley Fabrication £120,000 to support their growth plans.
A total of 57 jobs will be created at McAuley Precision, with the remaining 30 positions being recruited at McAuley Fabrication.  It is understood 23 of the 87 new jobs are already in place.
Jonathan McAuley, managing director of McAuley Precision and McAuley Fabrication, said the investment signalled a "major milestone" in its growth strategy and would help to cement their "reputation as credible suppliers in our target markets".
"The international aerospace and transportation sectors are particularly important growth areas for us and working with Invest NI we aim to scale up our workforce and manufacturing capabilities to secure work within these valuable supply chains," he added.
"Our investment activities in the coming months will involve upgrading our manufacturing area, investing in our IT systems and new machinery as well as implementing a robust business development and marketing strategy to target new customers."
