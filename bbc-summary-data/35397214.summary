Paris attacks: Islamic State group 'releases video of attackers'

So-called Islamic State has posted a video apparently showing nine of the suspected Paris gunmen before they carried out the 13 November attack.

The footage shows some of the men beheading prisoners and conducting military training in the Middle East.
It also shows locations that were attacked in the French capital, leaving 130 people dead.
The video ends with images of UK MPs backing air strikes against IS in Syria.
The footage was released through the media channel of IS, Site monitoring group said.
President Francois Hollande said the video would not stop France from resisting terrorism.
"Nothing will deter us, no threat will make France waver in the fight," he told reporters in Delhi during an official visit to India.
The president said that the attacks were planned in Syria but prepared and organised in Belgium.
Site said the video was filmed in Raqqa, the de facto capital of IS, before the Paris attacks.
One of the images shows a man closely resembling Abdelhamid Abaaoud, the suspected ringleader of the attacks.
Abaaoud, a Belgian national, died in a police raid on a flat in Saint-Denis, near Paris, days after the attacks.
Nine suspected attackers died on 13 November or in the days after, and two more are on the run.
It is not clear why the video - which describes the attackers as "lions" who "brought France to its knees" - has been released more than two months after the attack.
