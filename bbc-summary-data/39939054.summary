Birmingham City Ladies: England forward Rachel Williams re-signs for WSL 1 club

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Birmingham City Ladies have re-signed England forward Rachel Williams.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Williams, 29, who spent two seasons with the Blues between 2011 and 2013, was a free agent after fellow Women's Super League (WSL) top-flight club Notts County folded in April.
She is the third ex-Notts County player to find a new club on the same day.
Liverpool signed one of her England team-mates, defender Amy Turner, while Wales international Angharad James has gone to Yeovil.
Leicester-born Williams was voted Players' Player of the Year at the FA Women's Football Awards in 2011.
She then scored an injury-time equaliser when Birmingham beat Chelsea on penalties to win the Women's FA Cup in 2012.
And she was part of the Blues team who narrowly missed out on the WSL title on the final day of the season in 2014, scoring 14 goals in as many games.
Williams, who started at home-town club Leicester City prior to joining Doncaster Belles, signed for Chelsea in 2014 before moving on in 2015 to Notts County.
