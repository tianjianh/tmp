[SN]TITLE[SN]
Provisional date set for Craig Whyte fraud trial

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Former Rangers owner Craig Whyte could be set to stand trial next year over an alleged fraudulent takeover of the Ibrox club.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 45-year-old faces two charges - one of fraud and a second allegation under the Companies Act.
The High Court in Glasgow heard a trial had been provisionally set for April 2017, with a two-day hearing taking place in December.
Mr Whyte entered no plea and his bail was continued.
The first accusation claims Mr Whyte obtained a "majority and controlling stake" in Rangers "by fraud".
The charge dates are between May 2010 and May 2011, listing various locations including Ibrox Stadium, Murray Park as well as "addresses meantime unknown" in Monaco and France.
It is alleged Whyte and his representatives pretended to then Rangers owner Sir David Murray and others that "funds were available" to make all stipulated payments.
The second charge under the Companies Act centres on an Â£18m payment in connection with the takeover.
Mr Whyte was once again represented by Donald Findlay QC. Alex Prentice QC is now heading the prosecution team in the case.
Mr Prentice told the hearing: "The Lord Advocate asked that I step in... That is what I will do."
