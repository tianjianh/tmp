The 33-year-old was found in Drake Street, Rochdale, on Friday morning.
He was taken to hospital and is in an induced coma. His friends told officers he had been taking the legal high.
Police issued an urgent warning after a second man, aged 39, was also found collapsed in Drake Street several hours later.
The man is also believed to have taken a legal high and was treated by medics at the scene before leaving.
Det Insp Andy Butterworth, from Greater Manchester Police, said: "The use of legal highs is a worrying trend and has ended with a man in hospital in intensive care.
"I want to remind people about the potentially life-threatening consequences of legal highs - they may not be illegal but they definitely are not safe."
