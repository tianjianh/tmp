Swansea City are "too good to go down" despite sitting in the Premier League relegation zone, says midfielder Leroy Fer.

Saturday's 3-2 defeat at Arsenal, the Swans' first match under new boss Bob Bradley, saw them slip to 19th place.
Swansea have not won in seven league matches since they beat Burnley on the opening day.
"We have strong players and a strong team. We just need to get the points," Fer told BBC Wales Sport.
"The Premier League is hard, but I think our players are too good to go down.
"It is easy [to know what we need to do] to climb up the table and not go down. We need some wins to go with strong performances."

Fer, who joined the Swans on a permanent basis from QPR this summer following a loan spell last season, says Bradley is making his mark.
"We have a new coach and I think he has brought some life into the team and I think you could see that in our performance [against Arsenal]," he said.
"His training sessions are hard. He's trying to get us fitter and fitter and I think we need that as well.
"The mindset is different. We fought to the end against Arsenal and if we do that against other teams, we are going to get results.
"Hopefully we are going to start getting points."
