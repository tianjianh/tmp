Racing at the Isle of Man TT has been cancelled on Thursday due to "torrential" rain on the island.

Clerk of the course Gary Thompson confirmed no racing or qualifying events will be held following a consultation with the Manx Met office.
He said the second Supersport race will not take place, but further consultation is due regarding the one-lap TT ZERO for electric bikes later.
The event's main senior race remains scheduled for Friday.
The Mountain Road was closed due to flooding but was due to reopen after 13:00 BST, police said.
A spokesman said conditions on the road were "treacherous" due to "torrential rain and fog."
Motorists have been advised to take extra care.
Ian Hutchinson and Michael Rutter won Wednesday's races while two riders died in separate crashes.
Irish road racer Alan Bonner was the third rider to lose his life at this year's event following Jochem van den Hoek and Davey Lambert.
Despite the weather, The Peel TT Bike Show in the west of the island is still going ahead as planned.
