[SN]TITLE[SN]
Perth man sent rape text threats to nurse

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A 35-year-old man took legal highs before threatening to kidnap, rape and kill a nurse in a series of texts and voice messages, a court has heard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Robert Garrick sent more than 60 messages to the woman during a 24-hour period.
He was given her work mobile number after the health worker was assigned to deal with him when he attended a medical day centre.
Garrick, from Perth, admitted leaving the texts and voice messages.
Perth Sheriff Court was told that Garrick had become besotted with the woman and sent the "grossly offensive and menacing" messages between 11 and 12 November this year.
Fiscal depute Stuart Richardson told the court: "She was assigned to try and assist him with his difficulties. She had the works phone and took it home.
"In some of the messages he declares his undying love for this lady, the nurse, but unfortunately he also called her a cow. The most worrying was where he threatened to kidnap her, have sex forcibly with her and kill other people who worked at the day centre."
Solicitor Linda Clark, defending, said: "He had taken certain legal highs and that seems to have knocked him Awol. Legal highs seem to be the nub of the problem.
"Much of the content of the messages was neither threatening nor abusive, but he declares his undying love and says how much she means to him and that he misses her.
"The calls were described as rambling rants and were him saying he felt unsupported and had no-one to look after him. People at the day centre were aware of his ups and downs."
Garrick, who works for a building firm, had sentence deferred by Sheriff Lindsay Foulis for the preparation of reports. He was remanded in custody.
