[SN]TITLE[SN]
Gavin Brown stands down as Scottish Conservative finance spokesman

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Conservative MSP Gavin Brown is to stand down as the party's finance spokesman in the Scottish Parliament .

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The announcement came as the Lothian MSP revealed he will not seek re-election to Holyrood next year.
Mr Brown has been an MSP since 2007, and was appointed finance spokesman by the then party leader Annabel Goldie in May 2011.
He has described serving the people of the region as "an enormous privilege."
Mr Brown said: "I will have served nine years by 2016 and would like to seek a fresh challenge going forward.
"Given that I will not seek re-election, I am standing down from my role as Scottish Conservative finance spokesman.
"This decision takes immediate effect. It has been a thoroughly fascinating role at a key time in Scottish politics. However, it is a pivotal role and I believe it must be held by someone who intends to stand at the next election."
