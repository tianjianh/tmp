[SN]TITLE[SN]
Chesterfield 2-0 Walsall

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Ched Evans produced another inspired performance as Chesterfield beat Walsall 2-0 at the Proact Stadium.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The striker took his goal tally to four in three league games with a second-half double that sealed back-to-back home wins and took Chesterfield to the top of the table.
Walsall started well when Simeon Jackson's flick put Andreas Makris in but his shot from the edge of the area hit the crossbar in the 11th minute.
But Chesterfield responded with a low drive from Jay O'Shea that Neil Etheridge did well to turn behind for a corner in the 19th minute and Gboly Ariyibi fired into the side netting in the 34th minute.
Etheridge made another excellent save in the 61st minute when he parried a low shot from Evans and the striker saw a 20-yard strike saved five minutes later.
But the goalkeeper could do nothing in the 75th minute when Evans ran forward and smashed in a right foot shot from 20 yards that flashed inside the left post and he was beaten again four minutes later by a deflected strike from the edge of the box.
