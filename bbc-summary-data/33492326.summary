A plan to improve the Wrexham university was unveiled by the vice-chancellor, Prof Graham Upton.
He said the university hoped to generate a turnover of up to £75m in the same period.
Last year the university was stopped from recruiting overseas students after an investigation into alleged visa fraud. The ban has since been lifted.
The university said on Thursday it expected to turn a £4m deficit into a £1.7m surplus next year.
