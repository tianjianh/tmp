[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Dentist Dr Helen Nicoll, 53, was found in Great Wilbraham at about 06:30 BST on Friday.
Officers said they were treating her death as "unexplained pending further tests and inquiries".
A 53-year-old man from south Cambridgeshire, arrested in connection with the death, was released with no further action and his bail cancelled.
A police spokesman said further tests would be carried out "to provide clarity over the circumstances of her death".
The case had been passed to the coroner, he said.
Mrs Nicoll lived at the property in Frog End with her husband, Stephen Nicoll, 53, also a dentist, with a practice in Harley Street.
Neighbours described them as a "loving but private" couple.
