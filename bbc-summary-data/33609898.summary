The Cubric at Cardiff University will have one of the world's most sophisticated MRI scanners.
The funding, announced on Wednesday, will help build the facility at Maindy Park.
Prof Derek Jones, director of Cubric, said: "This funding cements Cubric's position as a European leader in brain imaging and stimulation."
Announcing the funding, Finance Minister Jane Hutt said: "I am delighted to announce EU funds to help construct a centre of excellence in Wales with the capability for world-class, highly specialised collaborative research in the field of neuroscience.
"This is another excellent example of how EU funds are supporting growth in the Welsh economy, helping our academic institutions to position Wales as a global leader in ground-breaking research and innovation."
The Welsh government has also invested more than £9m in the development of Cubric, including funding towards an ultra-high field Tesla MRI scanner.
The centre is due to open next year.
