[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Aurora Borealis - better known as the Northern Lights - has been giving rare and spectacular displays over parts of England.

The light show, which is caused by electrically charged particles from the Sun entering the Earth's atmosphere, was visible as the Earth moves into a new alignment with the Sun.
The display was spotted across the North East, Yorkshire and Cumbria.
Here are some of the images that were captured.
