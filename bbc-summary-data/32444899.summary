An animal welfare charity has completed a rescue of "unprecedented scale" at a puppy farm in the Republic of Ireland.

The Irish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals has removed 340 dogs from the farm in Myshall in County Carlow over the past nine days.
The ISPCA said the majority of the dogs had heavily matted coats, and were also suffering from chronic skin, eye and teeth problems.
Eleven horses were also rescued.
The rescued dogs were mostly adult females ranging in breeds from cocker spaniels, Siberian huskies, Yorkshire terriers, Bichon Frise crosses, Cavalier King Charles and Shih Tzus.
Their paws were badly infected from being soaked in urine, according to the charity.
Most of the animals have been transported to the ISPCA's national animal centre in Longford, with others taken to welfare groups.
A closure notice has been served on the breeding premises.
ISPCA chief inspector Conor Dowling said: "The conditions in this dog breeding establishment were absolutely shocking and it was imperative that it be shut down."
Dr Andrew Kelly, the charity's chief executive, said it was an "appalling and horrific case".
"Many of these animals were living in squalid conditions and there were dead animals scattered around the site," he added.
