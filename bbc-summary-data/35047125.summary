A Tory MP who is a keen boxer has suggested that the sport could help to prevent extremism in prisons.

Charlotte Leslie, who represents Bristol North West, made the suggestion during questions in the Commons, where she also called for more pilot schemes involving non-contact boxing.
Home Affairs Select Committee chairman Keith Vaz said he was "not absolutely convinced" that boxing was the answer.
Prisons minister Andrew Selous agreed to discuss the matter with Ms Leslie.
Ms Leslie trained in boxing as a teenager. In 2011 she set up an all-party parliamentary group to promote boxing as a way of encouraging discipline in youngsters.
She is also president of Avonmouth National Smelting Boxing Club.
She said: "I have seen first hand the benefits of boxing in giving young people a sense of discipline, respect, self-esteem and the ability to walk away from a fight - both from my own experience boxing, and in what clubs are doing."
She added: "Are you aware of the success of boxing in rehabilitation in helping prevent extremism, including in prisons like HMP Doncaster?"
Mr Selous said: "I can tell you that across prisons in England and Wales we have 183 different sports based interventions, though not all of them are available in all prisons."
Mr Vaz said: "I'm not absolutely convinced that teaching potential jihadists boxing or table tennis will actually form an essential part of a de-radicalisation programme. But I'm ready to be convinced on the pilot."
