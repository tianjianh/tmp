Iommi, a founder member of the Birmingham heavy metal band, has been diagnosed with the early stages of the disease.
In a statement on the 63-year-old's website, his fellow band members urged fans to send "positive vibes".
The band said they would move from Los Angeles to London to work with Iommi while he undergoes treatment.
"The Iron Man of Rock and Roll remains upbeat and determined to make a full recovery," Black Sabbath said.
The band had been working with producer Rick Rubin in LA on their first album with Ozzy Osbourne in 33 years, due for release in the autumn.
In November, Black Sabbath had announced the original line-up, including Osbourne, would reunite for a world tour.
Osbourne was axed from the four-piece in 1979 and replaced by Ronnie James Dio, who died of cancer in 2010.
The band, one of the most successful heavy rock acts of all time, have sold about 70m records worldwide.
