Hamilton sign defender Jordan McGregor after Hibs exit

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Hamilton Academical have signed central defender Jordan McGregor on a one-year deal after he left Hibernian.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 19-year-old spent the second half of last season on loan to Berwick Rangers, playing 16 times and scoring twice for the Scottish League Two side.
He becomes manager Martin Canning's first signing of the close season.
Hamilton could lose two of their regular defenders this summer with both right-back Ziggy Gordon and centre-half Lucas out of contract.
Gordon has been linked with Dundee and Jagiellonia Bialystok.
The 23-year-old, capped by Scotland at under-19 level, came through the youth ranks at New Douglas Park.
Lucas joined Accies last summer after the 25-year-old left Moldovan club Milsami Orhei and is now back home in Brazil considering his options.
Accies also look likely to lose goalkeeper Michael McGovern after the 31-year-old impressed for Northern Ireland during the Euro 2016 finals.
His contract ran out at the end of June and, like Gordon and Lucas, he has not accepted the offer of a new deal.
