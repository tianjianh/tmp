New York City FC 0-7 New York Red Bulls

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Frank Lampard was jeered by his own fans as his New York City side were humiliated 7-0 by New York Red Bulls.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Substitute Lampard, 37, was making his first appearance of the season in the week it was revealed that he earns $6m (£4.1m) - more than the entire Red Bulls squad.
Patrick Vieira's City - who started with fellow big names Andrea Pirlo and David Villa - had 57.7% of possession.
Bradley Wright-Phillips scored twice for the Red Bulls.
The former Manchester City striker now has 50 goals in MLS - one fewer than Thierry Henry managed for the same club.
Red Bulls were already 5-0 up when ex-Chelsea and England midfielder Lampard, who had been out with a calf injury, replaced Pirlo with 15 minutes remaining.
The win equals the record for the biggest margin in MLS history.
Los Angeles Galaxy beat Dallas Burn 8-1 in 1998 while Chicago Fire beat Kansas City Wizards 7-0 in 2001.
Lampard, Pirlo and Villa are all in the league's top 10 earners, with Red Bulls' top earner Wright-Phillips in contrast set to make $650,000 (£448,000) this season.
