The 51-year-old from Caernarfon said he was "immensely proud" to become a Sir.
Wales football manager Chris Coleman has been appointed an OBE after guiding his side to the semi-finals of Euro 2016.
Olympic cyclist Elinor Barker, 22, and Paralympian Hollie Arnold, 22, were among the sports stars appointed MBEs following a summer of sporting success.
Mountain rescue volunteers, prison officers, teachers, nurses, paramedics and professors from across Wales were also honoured.
And June Thomas, who campaigned to have defibrillators installed in Welsh schools following the death of her 15-year-old son Jack, was awarded a BEM.
Internationally acclaimed bass-baritone opera singer Sir Bryn said his new title "sounds quite exciting - daunting as well".
He added: "I'm immensely proud to accept this, and I think of my family, I think of my sons, I think of my fans, I think of the great British public."
Sir Bryn started singing at eisteddfod competitions from the age of four and made his stage debut with Welsh National Opera in 1990, singing Guglielmo in Mozart's Cosi Fan Tutte.
His first international offer came from Salzburg, and since then he has appeared in all the major opera houses of the world, with music as diverse as Mozart and Wagner, Puccini and Stravinsky, winning two Grammies and four Classical Brit awards.
Sir Bryn was a strong supporter for a home for opera in Wales and since the Wales Millennium Centre in Cardiff Bay opened in 2004, he has performed there many times.
He is also the president of homeless charity Shelter Cymru and patron of Bobath Children's Therapy Centre Wales.
"This is something I will hopefully carry with pride, and think it might help some young singers to achieve something - and to dream - and that is something very important," he said.
Elsewhere, Gerard Elias QC, Welsh Assembly standards commissioner, Prof Dai Smith, former chair of the Arts Council of Wales and father to Labour MP Owen Smith, and Cardiff University's Prof Hywel Rhys Thomas and Prof Anita Thapar were all made CBEs.
Flintshire head teacher Rosemary Jones said she was "surprised and delighted" to have been appointed an OBE in the list alongside Coleman.
The head of Ysgol Elfed High School for 10 years was honoured for her contribution for education.
Other honours include an MBE for former Football Association of Wales president Trefor Lloyd Hughes for his services to Welsh football, particularly on Anglesey.
Mr Lloyd said he was torn over whether to accept the award, saying there were people who deserved it a "lot more than me" and it "could have been anybody".
