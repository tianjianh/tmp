The Belfast club, second in the league table behind Crusaders, were unbeaten during March and also beat Cliftonville in the Irish Cup quarter-finals.
On Saturday, Healy's men face a top of the table clash with Crusaders.
"The team are on a high at the moment and winning breeds confidence," said the former Northern Ireland striker.
"We have a cup final to look forward to and are in contention for the title, although Crusaders are still the favourites."
Linfield won four out of four in the league during March with victories over Glentoran, Cliftonville, Ballinamallard United and Warrenpoint Town.
Healy won his first NI Football Writers manager of the month award in December.
