The Crimestoppers charity is offering a £10,000 reward for information about the 1996 murder of Scottish schoolgirl Caroline Glachan.

The 14-year-old was found dead on the banks of the River Leven in Dunbartonshire on 25 August 1996.
Her mother, Margaret McKeich, recently led appeals as the inquiry reached 20 years without the killer being found.
Crimestoppers said the reward would be paid for information which leads to an arrest and conviction.
Information passed directly to the police will not qualify for the reward.
Angela Parker, national manager for Crimestoppers in Scotland, said: "Twenty years on, and Caroline's family are still left with unanswered questions as to what happened to her.
"I am asking for people who might have any information, no matter how insignificant they think it might be, to contact Crimestoppers anonymously, because you could be the person that provides the missing pieces to the puzzle.
"We never ask who you are or any of your details. You'll never speak to anyone from the police or ever go to court. Please do the right thing, and tell us who is responsible for taking a young girl's life."
Anyone with information is asked to contact Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111 or through an anonymous online form.
Last week police said they were following up more than 20 calls after the murder inquiry featured on the BBC's Crimewatch programme.
Some calls related to the identity of a hooded man seen near Caroline before she died.
Video contributions to the programme were also made by Mrs McKeich and the schoolgirl's friend, Joanne Menzies, who was one of the last people to have seen her alive.
Police Scotland's Homicide Governance and Review team recently started a fresh investigation and forensic scientists are re-examining more than 300 items collected at the time of Caroline's death.
