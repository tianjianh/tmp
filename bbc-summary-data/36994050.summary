[SN]TITLE[SN]
Oldham Athletic 0-0 Walsall

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Oldham played out a goalless draw with Walsall in an entertaining contest at Boundary Park.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
In new Latics manager Stephen Robinson's first home league game in charge, the hosts had the better of the first half, Billy McKay firing just over with a 20-yard shot.
But Walsall suffered a blow on 31 minutes when left-back Rico Henry was led off after dislocating his shoulder, having made a superb headed clearance from a Marc Klok free-kick.
Franck Moussa shot wide early in the second half for the Saddlers before teeing up Simeon Jackson for a near-post effort that was well saved by Connor Ripley.
Oldham's goalkeeper was again tested soon after by a fine effort from substitute Andreas Makris that he tipped aside.
But McKay had a chance with a header saved by Etheridge before Lee Erwin hit the post with a header after Ryan Flynn's shot was blocked by the Walsall goalkeeper.
