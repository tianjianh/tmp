He arrived at the International Space Station on Tuesday after blasting off from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan on a Soyuz rocket.
In tweets, he said he was "loving every minute" of the first days of his stay.
Later on Friday he will answer questions from journalists in a live link-up with the European Astronaut Centre in Cologne, Germany.
Mr Peake is among six crew members living and working in space.
They include US station commander Scott Kelly, who is spending a year on board the ISS.
In a tweet, mentioning the Nasa astronaut, the 43-year-old from Chichester in Sussex said: "What makes a good leader? @StationCDRKelly having a hot bacon sarnie waiting as my 1st meal on #ISS. Boy that tasted good! #Principia."
And he added: "1st 48hrs on ISS - busy but incredible. Amazing how fast the body adapts to new environment. Found my tea ... life is good!"
The former Army aviator and helicopter test pilot also received messages of support from the Queen and Sir Elton John after the successful launch and docking on Tuesday.
He tweeted singer Sir Elton John from space, quoting his famous song Rocket Man, in response to a good luck message.
And he tweeted the Queen from space after Buckingham Palace's twitter account posted a good luck letter from the monarch.
Later on Friday, Mr Peake will speak to members of the press via a live link to the European Astronaut Centre near Cologne in Germany.
The question and answer session will be streamed live on the European space agency website.
It will be a brief break from a busy schedule.
According to the European Space Agency, he has a number of tasks to perform, including unpacking cargo, spending an hour on an exercise bike and taking part in an experiment looking at the effects of microgravity on the bone marrow.
