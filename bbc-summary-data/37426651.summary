[SN]TITLE[SN]
Mooning and streaking outlawed in Victoria, Australia

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Exposing your bare buttocks in public has been officially made a crime in the Australian state of Victoria.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Known as mooning, the cheeky offence was previously punishable under other laws but is now banned under specific legislation.
First-time offenders face up to two months in jail while repeat offenders could spend six months behind bars.
The amendment was one of more than 50 crimes included in an overhaul of sexual offence laws.
The updated legislation has been designed, in part, to separate pranks involving nudity from acts of sexual exposure.
The Summary Offences Act states that "behaviour that is indecent offensive or insulting includes behaviour that involves a person exposing (to any extent) the person's anal or genital region".
It specifically cites "mooning or streaking" as an example of such an offence.
The act also outlaws singing "an obscene song or ballad" and behaving in a "riotous, indecent, offensive or insulting manner".
