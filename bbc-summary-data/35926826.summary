[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Christopher Halliwell, 52, of Swindon, is accused of murdering Becky Godden, who was last seen alive in 2002.
She was 20 at the time but was not reported missing until 2007 as her family thought she was living in the Bristol area.
Her body was found in a field in Eastleach, Gloucestershire, in 2011.
Mr Halliwell appeared via video-link at Bristol Crown Court, speaking only to confirm his name.
He did not enter a plea and was remanded in custody.
