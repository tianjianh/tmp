The 26-year-old former Melbourne Rebels man can play as a wing or at full-back.
"He is an excellent acquisition. He has consistently impressed in Super Rugby," director of rugby Andy Robinson said.
Woodward added to the club website: "I felt it was the right time for me to experience playing in a new environment and Bristol is the right fit for me."
