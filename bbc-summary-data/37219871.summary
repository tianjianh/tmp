Warwickshire leg-spinner Josh Poysden claimed a career-best 5-53 to help bowl out County Championship Division One leaders Middlesex at Edgbaston.

Playing in only his ninth first-class match, 25-year-old Poysden took five successive wickets, backed by 4-41 from Chris Wright, as the visitors faltered from 100-2 to 242 all out.
Middlesex looked set with Dawid Malan (57) and Nick Compton (33) together.
But, after they went, Stevie Eskinazi's 49 was the only contribution of note.
Having limited Middlesex to just one batting point, Warwickshire then faced two overs before the close, making just a single.
Middlesex's ambitions of a first Championship title since 1993 were jolted by their former fast bowler Wright's two wickets in his first 13 balls, Sam Robson edging to slip before Nick Gubbins gave a low return catch.
But, after Compton edged to slip, Poysden took over the lead role in a Bears attack fired up to earn the one win needed to ensure their Division One status.
And Middlesex were eight down before this season's leading Bears wicket taker Jeetan Patel got in on the act with his only scalp of the day, Toby Roland-Jones, caught at leg-slip.
With Tim Ambrose ruled out by a buttock strain, Warwickshire brought in wicketkeeper Alex Mellor for his first Championship game for the Bears - his third in all after playing two for Derbyshire on loan.
Ambrose is expected to be fit for the One-Day Cup final against Surrey on 17 September, while Middlesex hope top have England paceman Steven Finn, who did some bowling in the middle before play began, back for the trip to face bottom club Nottinghamshire at Trent Bridge next week.
Warwickshire bowler Josh Poysden told BBC WM:
"It was a great day for us as a team. We definitely would have batted if we had won the won the toss, so the way the three seamers bowled up front was outstanding, taking early wickets and keeping a team right up there at the top of the division down to two an over.
"I was pleased with the way I bowled and felt in a really good rhythm against the left-handers all day. In Championship cricket it's a question of how often can you bowl your best ball.
"During tea I spoke to our bowling coach Alan Richardson. He mentioned something technical that made a massive difference. After that I felt really good. I'm absolutely chuffed to get my maiden five-for."
Middlesex managing director of cricket Angus Fraser told BBC Radio London:
"It is a used pitch, which they played the T20 Finals Day on, and a 50-over match, so it's had 200-odd overs on it and you would expect it to do a little bit. When you get to this end of the season, trying to find a fresh pitch is quite difficult.
"We would have liked to come through the first day still batting but we are in the game. 242 is a competitive score and it's up to us to bowl with the same discipline Warwickshire did.
"There were periods where there didn't seem to be a lot happening and then suddenly there were 10 or 20-minute periods where quite a lot seemed to happen."
