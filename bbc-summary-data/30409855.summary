Programmes such as Don't Tell The Bride and Snog Marry Avoid? won't continue on BBC Three when the channel moves online, the man in charge has told Newsbeat.

"We have to be absolutely ruthless about deciding which ... programmes are suited to this online world," said Damian Kavanagh.
He said the wedding and 'make-under' programmes won't survive. "Those shows, I don't think, will exist on BBC Three in their current form, we might find a clever way of reinventing them."
Snog Marry Avoid? - in which extravagantly-dressed people are encouraged to ditch the make-up and wear more tasteful attire - has attracted lots of criticism. Newspapers and politicians have singled it out as the sort of show the BBC shouldn't make.
One presenter from another part of the BBC even publically said the viewers were a "million idiots".
The proposal to drop the channel from TV still has to be approved by the group which runs the corporation on behalf of viewers, the BBC Trust.
The move online would save money, but Damian Kavanagh denies the quality of programmes will suffer despite the budget been cut from Â£85m to Â£25m.
"What's happening on BBC Three is that we're focussing on the areas that the audience has told us they love about BBC Three," he told Newsbeat.
"We're not closing BBC Three. What we're doing is concentrating on the things the audience has told us they deeply love about BBC Three, those things that they feel make BBC Three really distinctive as a proposition.
"So what we've decided to do is put all our commissioning effort around two things, Make Me Laugh and Make Me Think.
"So we're going to continue on BBC Three to do all the brilliant comedy that BBC Three has been doing for years, so everything from Bad Education to Little Britain and Gavin & Stacey and Cuckoo.
"We're talking about Family Guy at the moment and what's going to happen.
"We'll also, in the Make Me Think side of BBC Three, still continue to invest money in the brilliant factual programmes we've done like Our War; Life and Death Row; Women, Weddings, War and Me; the mental health seasons that we've done and additionally we will continue to produce one drama a year."
While many Radio 1 and 1Xtra listeners told Newsbeat they backed the move, some said they didn't agree with BBC Three going online.
Damian Kavanagh says BBC Three fans have nothing to worry about.
"We consulted across the BBC, we consulted across the industry but most crucially I think what we did is we listened to young people and did a lot of research."
Other online features include a daily news service, which will be created with Newsbeat. Programmes will live on iPlayer and be distributed on sites such as YouTube and Facebook.
