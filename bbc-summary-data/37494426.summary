Galloway artists see Star Wars projection project develop

Two Galloway artists are developing 3D projection technology which can recreate images similar to the talking hologram of Princess Leia in Star Wars.

Chris Helson and Sarah Jackets hope to use a Smart:Scotland grant of Â£100,000 to create a commercial prototype.
They first developed Help Me Obi as an art project in 2008.
They believe it could help businesses promote their products, aid medical students and change the way museums are able to exhibit artefacts.
It could also be used to transform video conferencing creating "virtual boardrooms or gatherings".
Mr Helson said the grant, secured with help from Business Gateway Dumfries and Galloway, had opened up new opportunities for the artists based near Newton Stewart.
"If we hadn't gone to Business Gateway 18 months ago I don't think we'd have fully realised the scale of the opportunity, one where we could be operating a global business," he said.
"Our adviser helped us develop our business model, highlighted potential funding streams and routes to market and provided advice regarding intellectual property.
"He also connected us to Interface, Heriot Watt University, and Scottish Enterprise."
He said the funding was now in place to develop a prototype which they hoped could attract further investment.
Business Gateway adviser Angus Robertson said: "Chris and Sarah are video and image specialists, producing large scale installations in public spaces.
"They came to us for advice, and by working closely with us their enterprise is now one of the few technology start-up companies to be accepted onto Scottish Enterprise's high growth portfolio each year.
"The intensive support they will now receive will move Helson and Jackets Technology Ltd closer to becoming a global name."
Inspiration for the Help Me Obi project came from Scottish scientist, James Clerk Maxwell, and a zoetrope into which the physicist had inserted lenses to make an image float.
Initial experiments produced an abstract image that flickered heavily but in 2014, the duo had a breakthrough and were able to stabilise and control the light.
Since then interest in their device has grown, with appearances on the Gadget Show and a Saltire Foundation trip to Silicon Valley where Mr Helson met with representatives from Facebook, Google, Electronic Arts, and Pixar.
He said the trip underlined the commercial possibilities for the technology.
"People were very interested in what we were doing, as it has never been done before," he said.
"When you stand looking at the image floating in front of you it's as if it is alive, and you connect with it in a totally different way than you would if it were a 2D or 3D film or video.
"Because it is not immersive, like VR goggles are, you're looking in on the object and can see it from all angles as you move around a room."
The technology is being put on show on 5 October as part of Dumfries and Galloway business week.
