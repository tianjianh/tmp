Papers discuss India's squad for the cricket World Cup and the exclusion of all-rounder Yuvraj Singh from the team.

India on Tuesday announced a 15-man team to defend their title in Australia and New Zealand next month.
All-rounders Stuart Binny, Akshar Patel and Ravindra Jadeja have been included in the team.
Mahendra Singh Dhoni will continue to lead the one-day international team despite recently retiring from Test cricket.
India won the World Cup in 2011 under Dhoni's leadership and his side had players like legendary Sachin Tendulkar, Gautam Gambhir and Yuvraj Singh.
Papers say Dhoni will lead a new-look team in 2015 because India's selectors seem to have gone for youth over experience.
"Four years after winning the World Cup at home, only four players from the meritorious Class of 2011 will travel to Australia and New Zealand to defend the title," says The Indian Express.
The paper adds that Dhoni has an impossible target of repeating his 2011 achievement.
"Ever since that victory lap at Wankhede [stadium in Mumbai], it has been downhill for Dhoni and his team. Unlike the last time, when he led men with lofty reputations to the top of the podium, mediocrity enjoys a majority in the Indian dressing room this time," it adds.
The Hindustan Times, however, seems impressed with the squad.
"This squad should lift India's fielding standards, vital on the bigger grounds in Australia. It also has a sprinkling of all-round cricketers. Gujarat's 20-year-old Akshar Patel's selection could prove an inspired one as his left-arm spin stood up well against Sri Lanka at home and he is also a sharp fielder and useful lower-order batsman," it says.

However, some papers and Twitter fans seemed disheartened over Yuvraj Singh's exclusion from the team.
"Had it been the case of a national mandate on the basis of ballots, fans would have easily sent him to Australia. But an Indian team selection doesn't work on public sentiment. It's all about numbers, current form, the assessment of the selectors and of course, what Dhoni feels about the situation," says The Times of India.
And finally, authorities in Delhi have decided to impose a fine on vehicles that obstruct the path of ambulances, The Times of India reports.
The national capital suffers from heavy traffic and ambulances and other emergency vehicles often have to slow down due to people not following traffic rules.
The police will now impose a fine of 2,000 rupees [Â£20; $31] on people who are caught obstructing the path of such vehicles.
"All a hospital has to do is report to us the vehicle number, date and time of violation and proof, if any," the paper quotes a police official as saying.
