The tournament between the island's junior side and those of Scotland, Ireland and Denmark will take place between 23 July and 1 August 2017.
The winners will go through to the main tournament in New Zealand.
"I think we can do quite well. We've got to do some hard work to get ready for the tournament as Ireland and Scotland will be strong," said Chris Minty of the Jersey Cricket Board.
The Under-19 sides of the 10 full members of the ICC have already qualified for the event between January and February 2018, as have Namibia who were the best-placed associate member nation at the World Cup earlier this year.
The winners of the tournament in Jersey will join them, along with four other regional champions.
Jersey are no strangers to staging ICC tournaments, having hosted World Cricket League events in 2016, 2013 and 2008 as well as a number of Twenty20 tournaments.
"It's great that the ICC are entrusting us once again for a tournament," Minty told BBC Sport.
"It's testament to the quality of our facilities and our infrastructure."
