Game of Thrones star Peter Dinklage has been replaced as the voice of a computerised guide in a video game after criticism of his performance.

Dinklage had provided the voice of artificial intelligence assistant Ghost on the first-person shooter Destiny.
His performance was called "awfully wooden" and likened to "someone reading a book to a child".
He will be replaced by voice actor Nolan North, who works on the successful Uncharted gaming franchise.
Criticism of Dinklage's performance first began last year when players were invited to test an "alpha" version of the PS4 game. His delivery was widely mocked, with testers drawing particular attention to one line of dialogue: "That wizard came from the moon".
The actor's voice was tinkered with for the subsequent "beta" version, which resulted in a more metallic android-style delivery.
Developers Bungie have now hired gaming veteran North to re-record the dialogue on the game and all previous content.
North's previous credits include Assassin's Creed and The Last of Us. Most famously, he plays treasure-hunter Nathan Drake in the Uncharted series, which has sold over 21 million copies worldwide.
He told the GameInformer website: "I was really excited to do this role.
"You want to give him as much personality as the world will allow, without making it unbelievable. There's a fine line to walk there, and I think we found it."
Dinklage has played Tyrion Lannister in HBO series Game of Thrones since 2011 and has won an Emmy and a Golden Globe Award for the role, as well as consecutive Primetime Emmy nominations from 2012 to 2015.
