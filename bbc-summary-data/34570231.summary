A man claims to have tackled midges that swarmed in their millions outside his home by constructing DIY traps.

The resident of Argyll lures the biting insects to compost heaps where they "roost" before he sprays them with soapy water.
The man who lives near Loch Awe said: "Out of desperation 14 years ago I started trapping and killing midges by the thousand.
"Over the years the population has declined to a tolerable level."
He got in touch with BBC Scotland after reading an online story about a reported rise in the number of small bats with a taste for midges.
Common pipistrelles have increased by about 79% since 2009, following years of decline.
A single pipistrelle can feed on up to 3,000 midges in one night, according to Scottish Natural Heritage.
