Indian media surprised at Gandhi's 'break' from politics

Papers in India are "surprised" at Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi's decision to go on leave in the middle of a crucial parliamentary session.

Mr Gandhi has taken a leave of absence from parliament to focus on party work, reports say.
The government is set to present the new financial year's budget on 28 February in the parliament, and papers say it is very unusual for the vice-president of the main opposition leader to miss it.
Mr Gandhi's party suffered an embarrassing defeat against Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party in last year's general elections.
With less than 50 seats in the parliament, observers say the party faces a threat of extinction if top leaders do not get their act together.
"Now, nine months into the Modi government's tenure and during a crucial budget session that is divided on the land acquisition bill - one of the few issues Rahul Gandhi cared to speak about in parliament - his absence provides more mirth than answers," The Times of India says.
The paper warns that Mr Gandhi "ought to see his own and his mother's (Congress president Sonia Gandhi) hand behind his party's misfortunes".
The paper further hints that the Gandhi family needs to stop dynastic politics for the party's sake.
"Sonia must anoint a successor or call for open elections in which the family does not take part. Congress held on to the Gandhis so far because they got votes and prevented the party from splitting," the paper says.
Calling Mr Gandhi "a reluctant leader", the Deccan Herald says it is "odd that he wants to take time off when the "party most needs a sense of purpose and direction".
The paper says Mr Gandhi's reason for the sabbatical that he wants to reflect on the party's future is "not convincing".
"If Rahul wants to get rid of the old guard and shape the party to his wishes, he should be working for it within the party. If the getaway is a tantrum, it only shows inability to address the party's ills and a failure of leadership," the paper adds.
The Hindu suggests that Mr Gandhi will miss out on an opportunity to make a comeback by going on leave.
"Rahul Gandhi could not have chosen a worse moment for self-introspection, coinciding as it does with a parliamentary budget session," it says.
