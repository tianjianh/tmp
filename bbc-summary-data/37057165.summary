"I am so happy I've got everything sorted now. I'm a better footballer than a plumber."

When Lewis Kinsella was released by Aston Villa at the end of last season, he thought he would struggle to find a club before the new season began.
The 21-year-old defender worked for his uncle as a plumber before he was signed up by League Two side Colchester United.
"I was working part-time to earn a bit of cash over the summer in case nothing happened," he told BBC Essex.
Kinsella began his career as a trainee with Arsenal before moving to Villa, where he failed to make a first-team appearance in five years with the club.
Despite the drop down to the fourth tier of English football, Kinsella is happy to be playing senior football after just two loan spells during his time with Villa.
"I think I was held back a bit [by Villa] but they've changed," he continued. "A lot of players there are getting out on loan and I think that's the best thing for young kids, they need to get out and play as many games as they can.
"When you're playing in League Two, at the end of the day it's their jobs, they've got to play for their families. If they drop down one more league then there's a chance that you could go part-time."
