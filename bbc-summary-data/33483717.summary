The 24-year-old American played is Surrey's second signing of the summer and their first overseas player.
Felder has played for Jacksonville State for the past two seasons in the NCAA Division I.
"I'm delighted to have added DJ to the squad," Scorchers head coach Creon Raftopoulos told the club website.
"Fans can expect a strong, dynamic power forward, a superb midrange shooter, with an excellent shooting touch."
Felder will join up with the squad ahead of their BBL opener away to Bristol Flyers on Saturday 19 September.
