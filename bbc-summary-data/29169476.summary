Monk has guided Swansea to three wins - away to Manchester United and at home to Burnley and West Brom.
His side are second in the table behind Chelsea, who they face away on Saturday, on goal difference.
"It's a honour and a privilege," said Monk, who dedicated the award to all the staff at the Welsh club.
"These sort of awards means that as a group we are doing something right.
"At this moment in time we want to try and keep this momentum and run going and hopefully we can continue that."
Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho, Stoke's Mark Hughes and Aston Villa manager Paul Lambert had also been shortlisted for the award.
As well as the three league wins, Swansea also tasted victory at the Liberty Stadium in the League Cup against Rotherham United.
Monk said his players demonstrated different attributes in their three Premier League triumphs during August.
"It was a very good team performance against Manchester United," said Monk.
"Against Burnley, we had to show another side to our game where we had to really dig deep in the second half and show our defensive qualities.
"Against West Brom we got on the front foot and in possession and scored some very good goals and created many, many chances.
"All three games have had everything which is great to see but we have to keep improving and maintain that."
