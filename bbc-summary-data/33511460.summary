[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Alexander Ciccolo, 23, has had history of mental illness and had recently become "obsessed with Islam," an acquaintance told the FBI.
In Mr Ciccolo's apartment FBI agents found a pressure cooker, chemicals and "attack planning papers".
Pressure-cooker bombs were used in the Boston marathon bombings that left three dead and dozen hurt.
According to court records, Mr Ciccolo told the acquaintance he was "not afraid to die for the cause" and called Americans "disgusting".
Mr Ciccolo came the FBI's attention after a Facebook profile connected to him praised Islamic State (IS) militants and he wrote that he wanted to fight for the group.
An FBI informant later talked with Mr Ciccolo and learned he planned to carry out attacks on behalf of IS in multiple US states. He eventually decided to target universities, the FBI said.
Mr Ciccolo had purchased bomb making materials, but also sought to acquire to guns to carry out his attack, the FBI said.  Agents arrested Mr Ciccolo on 4 July after he tried to buy weapons from the informant.
"The defendant ordered and took delivery of four firearms ... to use during his plan to kill innocent people," the Department of Justice said in a statement.
