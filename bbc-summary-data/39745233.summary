Aubrey Wadford attacked Angela Laskey, who was originally from Dumfries, at an apartment in Santa Barbara on 29 October 2014.
Santa Barbara County District Attorney Joyce E Dudley said Wadford pled guilty to second degree murder on Wednesday.
At Santa Barbara Superior Court, he also agreed to a prison sentence of between 16 years and life.
In a statement, the court said police officers were alerted to a disturbance after a neighbour heard screaming from the apartment.
It continued: "When Santa Barbara police officers arrived at the apartment, they found Ms Laskey face down near the front door having sustained multiple stab wounds.
"Ms Laskey was pronounced dead at the scene by paramedics. Mr Wadford was initially charged with first degree murder."
They added that Wadford admitted using a "deadly weapon" in the murder of Ms Laskey.
Her family declined to make a comment on the outcome of the trial.
