An episode of ITV2's Love Island is being investigated by Ofcom over a sex scene shown just after the watershed.

The footage, aired on 30 June, showed Emma-Jane Woodham and Terry Walsh getting intimate in a room full of other contestants.
There were eight complaints about the footage of the couple having sex, broadcast approximately 10 minutes after the 21:00 watershed.
Love Island features contestants pairing up on a luxury island.
One couple are voted the winners at the end of the series.
An Ofcom spokesman said: "This programme included sexual material shortly after the watershed. We're investigating whether the transition to more adult content was unduly abrupt."
In the scene, Woodham asked one of her fellow islanders: "If we have sex on top of the covers, they can't air that, can they?"
The two then got into bed with other contestants surrounding them in the room.
The scene showed contestants giving opinions of the couple's actions, along with footage of the two in bed. There was no full nudity in the scene.
The incident was not the only controversy of the series - former Miss Great Britain Zara Holland was stripped of her title after having sex with Alex Bowen on the show.
This series has attracted 39 complaints as a whole.
Love Island began in 2005 and ran for two series. It was revived last year and is now hosted by Caroline Flack.
Bosses recently ordered a third series.
It is thought to have attracted double the number of viewers it had last year, with an average of 1.3 million people watching each episode.
