A baby in the US state of Minnesota has survived an 11-storey fall from an apartment balcony, local media report.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Musa Dayib, one, has two arm fractures and is breathing with the help of a ventilator but is expected to live, after slipping through a railing.
His doctor said his youth as well as the softer ground he landed on helped contribute to his survival.
Family and friends in Minneapolis's Somali community say the family is in shock.
It is well documented that in such circumstances, a child often has better survival prospects than an adult would. This may be because children are more flexible, their bones less brittle. A smaller body mass may also mean that it is possible for a person [below] to break their fall.
What's the best way to catch a falling child?
"When people found out he survived, no one could believe it," community activist Abdirizak Bihi told the Star-Tribune newspaper.
"I'm more concerned about his dad and his mother," Mr Bihi said. "They're devastated. They can't even speak."
Dr Tina Slusher, who treated Musa, said an adult who fell from that distance would almost certainly be dead.
"Little [children] are more flexible and don't break as easily as we do and he also fell in a very small patch of mulch [loose material put on soil]," she told local broadcaster KARE.
But she added it was "definitely a miracle. It's God's gift to his family. Kids don't fall this far and make it often."
