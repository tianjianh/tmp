The body of Peter Stuart, 75, was found on Friday night after he and his wife Sylvia, who has yet to be found, were reported missing from their home in Weybread, near Harleston.
Police said the Stuarts visited Goodies Farm Shop in Pulham Market on 29 May.
Suspect Ali Qazimaj, 42, is now believed to have left the country on a ferry to France on Saturday night.
His silver CitroÃ«n C3 was found at midnight on Sunday in Athol Terrace, in Dover, a short cul-de-sac within sight of the ferry terminal.

Police said they now have "reliable information" which places the 42-year-old at the ferry terminal at about 18:30 BST on Saturday.
"It is strongly believed that he then boarded a passenger ferry unaccompanied to Calais in France soon after 7pm," police said.
"Enquiries nationally and internationally continue in an effort to locate him."
Police are keen to piece together the whereabouts of the Stuarts after the last sighting at Goodies at 10:18 BST, and when they were reported missing five days later, on Friday.
Mr Stuart's body was found in woodland surrounding the property later that evening. He had suffered multiple stab wounds.
The couple's son-in-law, Steve Paxman, 61, of Leicester, was arrested on Sunday and released on bail on Monday night.
The Stuart house and the last known address of Mr Qazimaj, in Tilbury, Essex, are still being searched by police.
Det Ch Insp Simon Parkes said: "The primary focus of our investigation remains on locating Sylvia.
"We are releasing this further information today in the hope that it may trigger someone's memory and help us piece together their movements.
"We know that family members were with the couple at their home address on Saturday 28 May and CCTV now places them in Pulham Market the next day.
"If you remember seeing Peter and Sylvia in Pulham Market or if you spoke with them or saw them around this time we are urging you to get in touch.
"It is also essential that we learn more about the whereabouts of Ali Qazimaj as we strongly believe that finding him will lead us to the location of Sylvia.
"Based on this new evidence it is highly likely that he has left the country, so our officers are working with colleagues within the UK and internationally in an effort to trace him."
Police believe he may have a family connection to Mr and Mrs Stuart, and should not be approached.
Earlier, Teresa Lawrence, who taught Mr and Ms Stuart line dancing when they lived in Essex, described them as a lovely couple with a "zest for life".
"They were always very bubbly and very loving towards each other. Sylvia was always very well kept and Peter was a jolly type of chap.
"He liked a bit of a laugh and a bit of banter and he was quite happy to make a fool of himself.
"They loved being together and line dancing was something they enjoyed together - it gave them a zest for a life."
