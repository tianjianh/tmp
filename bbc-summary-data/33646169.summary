Plans for wild salmon coastal net catching ban

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Plans for a complete ban on catching wild salmon using coastal nets have been announced by the Scottish government.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The proposal followed a consultation which attracted more than 600 responses.
It would also see the introduction of a licensing scheme for the killing of wild salmon caught in rivers.
The moves have been welcomed by the Association of Salmon Fishery Boards.
Scotland's biggest salmon netting company, Usan Salmon, said it was confident it would be allowed to start catching again once accurate salmon stock measurements have been taken.
A Scottish government notice states: "In terms of paragraph 11 of schedule 1 to the Salmon and Freshwater Fisheries (Consolidation) (Scotland) Act 2003 (the Act) notice is hereby given that the Scottish ministers propose to make conservation regulations under section 38 of the Act to introduce a licensing system for the killing of wild salmon in Scotland and a prohibition on the taking of salmon outwith inland waters."
It said: "The general effect of this proposal will be: (a) to prohibit the taking of Atlantic salmon outwith inland waters. (b) to prohibit the killing of salmon in Scotland without a licence."
Objections to the regulations must be submitted by 19 August.
The Scottish government said no decision had yet been taken but it would consider all the responses.
A spokeswoman said: "Our consultation on wild fisheries reform is ongoing and we are in the process of engaging with stakeholders."
