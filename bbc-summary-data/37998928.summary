A school has been branded "ridiculous" and "pathetic" after threatening pupils with detention if they take part in the "bottle-flip challenge".

The global craze involves half-filling a plastic bottle with water and throwing it in the air in the hope it will land upright.
North Walsham High School in Norfolk banned it for "safety reasons".
The school said it "did not want to spoil fun" but minor injuries involving plastic bottles made the ban necessary.
The challenge became an internet sensation after a video was posted in May of US high school student Mike Senatore performing tricks at a talent show.
Since then people have been trying to outdo each other, landing their bottles on surfaces including walls and windowsills.

The ban was posted on the school's website and Facebook page on Monday.
The school wrote: "Following a misunderstanding today, we would like to confirm that the 'bottle flip challenge' is not permitted in school.
"Students caught doing this will have an immediate C3 detention."
The Facebook post elicited more than 120 comments.
"It never fails to amuse me how much schools care about ridiculous things," one person wrote.
"It's flipping lost its bottle," said another while others said the school was being "ridiculous" and "pathetic".
One parent, however, supported it saying "they are there to learn, not to mess about".
The Facebook post was later removed after the school said "inappropriate language" was being used in comments, but the detention notice remains on the website.
Head teacher Neil Powell said: "Following one or two minor injuries sustained by students when water bottles hit them, we decided that for safety reasons we would ban the practice in school, before a more serious injury occurred.
"We are aware of several schools in Norfolk taking similar action to ban the challenge."
