The man doused an ants' nest in petrol before setting it alight, South Yorkshire Fire and Rescue said.
Flames quickly spread along a garden hedge before the man's house caught fire, melting plastic guttering, a plastic window frame and a garden chair.
A fire service spokesman said: "Using petrol to eliminate an ants' nest has to be a first for us."
The fire started at about 20:00 BST on Thursday.
The spokesman added: "We always tell people never to use petrol or other accelerants to get a fire going.
"The incident is a classic example of how even a small fire can so quickly develop into a much more serious incident."
