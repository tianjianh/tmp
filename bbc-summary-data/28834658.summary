[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A 20mph speed limit is being considered for more roads around Brighton.

Brighton and Hove City Council has sent a consultation letter to homes and businesses in Woodingdean, Ovingdean, Saltdean and Rottingdean.
The proposed speed limit reduction would be the the third phase of the scheme, which began in the city centre in April 2013.
The council says there has been a decrease in traffic speed of 74% on the roads.
Lead councillor for transport, Ian Davey, said: "We're seeing growing levels of support for 20mph as people understand the national research proving it to be safer."
Residents and businesses can also have their say in the consultation online.
