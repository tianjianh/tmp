Cooke (102 not out) waited until the final day for his first Championship ton of the season as the visitors moved from an overnight 88-0 to 365-3.
He put on an unbeaten 180 with Ingram (101 not out), as only David Payne (1-32) and Tom Smith (1-79) took wickets.
Hamish Marshall ran out Aneurin Donald (35), the day's only other dismissal.
Cooke raced to his century from 135 balls and hit 12 fours and two sixes, while ex-South Africa batsman Ingram's innings was a more patient one, reaching three figures from 220 balls, having struck 11 boundaries and one maximum.
Glamorgan finished fourth in the Division Two table, while Gloucestershire were sixth.
Glamorgan batsman Colin Ingram told BBC Wales Sport:
"It's always nice to end on a high note, fourth is probably a fair representation of where we've been this season, we've fought hard.
"We've had a poor back end to the season, but there are still a lot of good signs with younger guys coming into the squad, that we can really use and build on for next season.
"It was nice to really start putting some of my plans together, and that's what I want to bring back for next year.
"It's been very frustrating getting a lot of starts in the season especially early on, but I've had to work hard on my technique and I definitely feel that I'm starting to find a formula that can be more consistent next year."
