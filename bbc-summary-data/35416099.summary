Construction industry 'needs 21,000 recruits' over next five years

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The construction industry in Scotland will need more than 21,000 recruits over the next five years to replace those leaving the workforce.

But the official body that assesses the need for skills forecasts the sector's growth will be only a fifth of the average UK rate.
That is mainly due to the completion of transport projects in Scotland.
The Construction Skills Network report also reflects the start of new nuclear power plants in England and Wales.
The Network includes the Construction Industry Training Board and concludes that the workforce in Scotland will peak this year. That is after 6% growth over the past three years.
But after peaking around 230,000 this year, that is expected to fall to roughly 219,000 by the end of 2020. Scotland has the slowest growth rate in construction of any nation or region, and is the only part of the UK to expect a fall in the construction workforce over that period.
Despite the 0.7% annual decline, the report estimates there will still be a need to recruit around 4,200 people each year to replace the outflow of workers. That does not include those now in apprenticeships.
The recent strong showing of the construction industry has been clear from Scottish government statistics. They have shown that the sector has ensured that the economy as a whole did not go into recession during 2015.
In 2014, the Construction Skills Network reckons that the industry was only 9% short of the activity peak it reached in 2006 - recovering from a very sharp decline around the recession.
Government funds have been deployed to build the Queensferry Crossing over the Forth, and improvements to major roads, including the M8 through Lanarkshire. It is reckoned that 21% of output was in infrastructure in 2014, whereas the UK share was 11%.
While public spending is cut back in the next few years, industry experts expect to see growth of 3.6% in public sector house-building, 4.1% growth in private housing, and 2.3% growth in repair and maintenance.
For the rest of this decade, the construction industry's growth rate in Scotland is forecast at 0.5% per year, while the UK forecast is 2.5%.
The major projects being started include new nuclear power stations in the south of England and Wales. London is also to have continued investment in its transport.
Major construction projects that could help maintain construction industry output in Scotland include; the Aberdeen Western Peripheral Route, a 1,000-home development planned for Loudoun Castle in East Ayrshire, the Aberdeen exhibition and conference centre, new buildings for the universities of St Andrews, Glasgow, Edinburgh and Heriot-Watt, new schools, the Macallan distillery visitor centre in Moray, and redevelopment of the St James' Centre in central Edinburgh.
Beyond 2020, the Network report looks to work on dualling the A9 road between Perth and Inverness, upgrades to rail and road between Inverness and Aberdeen, rail improvements in the central belt, and the installation of offshore wind farms.
