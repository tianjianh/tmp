RNLI crews were first alerted to 30 stranded adults and children just after 12:00 BST on Sunday.
About 45 minutes later, two adults and a child were escorted to safety from a neighbouring sandbank, followed by a further 25 people soon after.
Coxswain Martin Jones said it was "quite an intensive hour" for the crew.
