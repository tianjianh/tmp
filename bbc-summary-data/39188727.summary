Blackpool 1-0 Stevenage

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Blackpool ended Stevenage's nine-game unbeaten run and moved to within three points of the League Two play-off places with a win at Bloomfield Road.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Seasiders took the lead after 15 minutes from the penalty spot. Jordan Flores' floating cross was adjudged to have been handled by Stevenage skipper Jack King, and Mark Cullen stepped up to convert.
Stevenage should have levelled after 39 minutes, when Dean Lyness produced a great save with his feet to deny King from six yards, before the defender then blasted over from the rebound.
But the visitors were grateful to Luke Wilkinson after 43 minutes, as he produced a superb goalmouth block to keep out Colin Daniel's close-range strike.
Stevenage, who had won eight of their previous nine, started the second half well and Ben Kennedy tested Lyness within two minutes.
Chances continued to come at both ends as Cullen was denied a second when his goal-bound prod from close range was blocked on the line by Kennedy after 62 minutes.
The Seasiders should have extended the lead 10 minutes from time, but Jamille Matt hit the post with a sitter from six yards after Ian Black's strike was parried by Chris Day.
