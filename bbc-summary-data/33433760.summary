He will combine the two roles as he looks to guide the country to the 2017 World Cup in Australia and New Zealand.
Terry Matterson led the Tomahawks to the last eight of the 2013 finals, eventually losing to winners Australia.
"I am honoured to be appointed head coach of the USA Hawks. We saw in 2013 the impact the USA team can have on the international rugby league game," McDermott told the Rhinos website.
"The main task is to qualify for the 2017 World Cup. But along that journey I hope to have an influence over the development of players coming through and have an input into the broader coaching network in the USA.
"Having had first-hand experience of working with the players in the States, I have been impressed with their attitude, athleticism and commitment to rugby league and that gives us strong foundations to build on."
McDermott has led Leeds to two Grand Final victories, one World Club Challenge success and a Challenge Cup win.
