Huddlestone, 26, has joined in a three-year deal for a fee in the region of Â£5m, while fellow midfielder Livermore, 23, moves on a season-long loan.
England international Huddlestone spent eight seasons at White Hart Lane, but struggled to secure a regular place under Andre Villas-Boas.
The former Derby youngster joined Spurs in 2005 and made 209 appearances.
Livermore came through the Spurs academy and had loan spells at MK Dons, Derby, Peterborough, Ipswich and Leeds.
