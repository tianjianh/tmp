Children's menus at Scots tourist attractions criticised

Restaurants at three leading Scottish visitor attractions have been criticised for their children's menus.

A team of undercover diners found that museums, zoos and galleries across the UK are offering unhealthy "lunchboxes".
The Soil Association survey also discovered that many attractions would not reveal the provenance of their ingredients.
Edinburgh's Royal Botanic Garden, Kelvingrove Museum and Stirling Castle were among those surveyed.
They were ranked 12th, 13th and 16th respectively on the list of 20 UK attractions visited by undercover families.
Nationwide, The Soil Association found that 75% of children's lunchboxes did not include a vegetable or salad option.
It said half of those surveyed offered lunchboxes with muffins, cakes and sweet treats - but no fresh fruit.
Rob Percival, the charity's policy officer, said: "Visitor attractions are making life hard for parents who want to enjoy a healthy and happy day out.
"Lunchboxes loaded with sugar and unimaginative ultra-processed foods are the norm.
"So long as junk-filled lunchboxes continue to dominate family outings, parents will have a hard time convincing their children that healthy food can be a treat too."
Earlier this year the Scottish Health survey revealed that  15% of boys and 14% of girls are at risk of obesity.
The Soil Association's Out to Lunch campaign is now calling on attractions to improve the food and experience they offer to children and families.
It has outlined a series of recommendations, including ensuring all children's meals include a vegetable or salad, and free fresh drinking water is available to families throughout their visit.
One secret diner, Anya Hart-Dyke, said: "I've lost count of the lunchboxes and children's meals we've encountered on family days out that I just wouldn't consider buying for my child - as a parent you get used to the disappointment.
"Healthy, real food must be a priority for family attractions - I'd be far more likely to come back if knew my child would get some proper food."
Stirling Castle was the worst performing Scottish attraction in the survey, scoring just 27 points out of a possible 150.
Parents said the lunchboxes were bland - though they did include fruit and the option of healthier drinks - and small portions of adult meals were not available.
The restaurant was criticised for promoting biscuits and sweets at the till, while "healthier snacks were nowhere to be found".
One parents reported that: "The staff were very helpful and friendly, but the lunchbox was disappointing. Veg was not included and the only fruit available was apples."
A spokesman for Historic Environment Scotland, which operates Stirling Castle, said the findings were "disappointing".
He added: "We regularly undertake work with our catering partner to ensure that much of the food on offer at our sites is made with locally-sourced ingredients, and options rotated on a seasonal basis, with prices benchmarked against other visitor attractions."
Diners praised staff at Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum in Glasgow.
They were pleased that children's portions of adults' meals were available on request and lunchboxes included a piece of fresh fruit.
However, they were concerned there were no fresh fruit pudding options for children or adults eating a hot meal.
The Soil Association said diners also struggled to find free, fresh drinking water throughout the museum.
It said the attraction would have scored higher if it had provided further details of its Scottish ingredients.
A spokesperson for Encore Hospitality, which manages the catering facilities at the museum, said: "We strive to offer healthy and locally sourced produce so feedback of this type is extremely valuable."
Secret diners said they were impressed with the botanic's "family-friendly experience" but their questions about provenance and quality were left unanswered.
It was praised for offering children's portions of adult meals and for including fresh fruit and salad options in lunch boxes.
However, there was some criticism of the attraction, which gave stamps on a loyalty card for choosing a "healthy option" children's lunchbox - even if it contained crisps and chocolate rather than vegetables and fruit.
One parent told The Soil Association: "The Botanics offers a great range of healthy foods, some of which are grown there."
Sodexo catering services director at the botanic gardens, Paul Mitchell, said the findings were "disappointing and surprising".
More than 70% of their suppliers were local, he said.
He added: "We never use processed foods, our dishes on-site are from fresh ingredients and our chef takes pride in supporting child-friendly events throughout the year."
