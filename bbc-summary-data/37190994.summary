[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Carl Brookes, 31, had a kilogram of the 93 per cent pure drug in a drawstring bag when he arrived at Five Ways railway station in Birmingham.
An industrial press at his home in Aqueduct Lane, Alvechurch, had traces of cocaine on it, police said.
Brookes pleaded guilty to possession of Class A drugs with intent to supply.
He was sentenced to eight years and seven months in prison at Birmingham Court Court.

Det Con Phil Caldwell said: "Brookes clearly used his daughter as a smoke screen to deflect attention from his criminal activity.
"It's abhorrent that he should use a young child in such a way and I am pleased that he will be spending time behind bars to reflect on his actions."
