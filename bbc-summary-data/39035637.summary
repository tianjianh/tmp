Bromley 0-5 Braintree Town

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Braintree pulled six points clear of the National League relegation zone with a 5-0 victory in a feisty clash at nine-man Bromley.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Iron took the lead through Michael Cheek's penalty on five minutes after Ross Flitney brought down Reece Hall-Johnson in the box.
Bromley's hopes were further dashed when Lee Minshull was shown a straight red card for a foul on Harry Lee just 16 minutes in.
The hosts then saw Daniel Johnson sent off for another foul on Hall-Johnson in the area on 32 minutes and Jack Midson converted the spot-kick.
Bromley also had boss Neil Smith sent to the stands before Hall-Johnson struck a third for Braintree in first-half added time.
Monty Patterson and Hall-Johnson added further gloss to the scoreline for Braintree in the second period, but the visitors had Ian Gayle sent off with six minutes remaining.
