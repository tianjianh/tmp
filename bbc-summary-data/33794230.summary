Figures from April to the end of June show BBC Radio Wales lost 18,000 weekly listeners. BBC Radio Cymru lost 10,000 in the same period.
The stations' average weekly audiences are now 408,000 and 116,000 respectively.
A BBC Cymru Wales spokesman said the broadcaster would be "looking at these figures carefully".
The figures show Radio Wales's audience fell for the second quarter in a row.
Radio Cymru's audience is still bigger than it was six months ago due to a surge in listeners in the first three months of the year.
A BBC Cymru Wales spokesman said: "We'll be looking at these figures carefully to ensure we continue to strengthen both stations into the future and monitoring how listeners consume our radio services in other ways, including via podcasts, where we've seen an increase in the number of downloads and the newly introduced download capability on iPlayer radio."
It was a mixed picture for some of the biggest radio brands in the commercial sector.
Capital South Wales gained 13,000 listeners with its weekly audience now 199,000, while Smooth Radio South Wales increased its audience by 20,000 to record a weekly listenership of 75,000.
Heritage station Swansea Sound lost 14,000 to record a weekly audience of 50,000, while 28,000 listeners left the Capital station serving the north west of England and north east Wales leaving it with 146,000 weekly listeners.
