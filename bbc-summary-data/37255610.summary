A B-25 bomber, a P-51 Mustang fighter and The Blades aerobatic team were among the first displays to take place near Low Green in Ayr on Friday.
The Saturday programme includes displays from The Red Arrows and RAF Falcons Parachute Team.
An estimated crowd of 120,000 attended the main Saturday event in 2015, with similar numbers expected this year.
Event manager Doug Maclean said: "We're very enthusiastic about what we've planned for 2016 knowing we will continue to excite and wow the crowds with some of the most amazing aircraft, pilots and displays they will ever see.
"The acts we have coming along are truly world-class and the fact they all want to come and take part in our event shows that the airshow has continued to grow from strength-to-strength."
South Ayrshire Council is the main sponsor of the airshow, which returned in 2014 after an absence of 22 years.
The council's chief executive, Eileen Howat, said: "The Scottish International Airshow has grown in magnitude and 2016's line-up is undoubtedly set to be the best yet.
"Last year around 120,000 people enjoyed the air display and demand has led to the addition of another day of flying and entertainment on the Friday.
"Not only is this a great family event, but it gives the local economy a real boost, generating over Â£5m last year, which is something we all benefit from."
Although anyone can watch the displays for free, ticket packages can be purchased for access to the entertainment area at Low Green.
One of the packages offers limited access to Prestwick Airport for a chance to see the aircraft up close.
