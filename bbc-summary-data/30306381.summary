Middlesbrough steel firm SM Thompson fined after worker loses three toes

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A Teesside steel firm has been fined after a worker was crushed by a press and had to have three toes amputated.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 25-year-old, from North Ormesby, was shaping metal when a part from the press fell on his foot on 17 March.
Teesside Magistrates' Court heard that SM Thompson Limited, of Middlesbrough, had allowed dangerous lifting practices to go unchecked over 10 years.
The firm admitted a Health and Safety Executive (HSE) breach and was fined Â£7,500. It must also pay Â£1,120 costs.
The hearing heard how the worker had to have the big toe on his left foot amputated and two other toes removed.
He was in hospital for seven days but has since returned to work, the hearing heard.
HSE inspector Paul Wilson said: "This worker's injuries need not have happened.
"The failure of SM Thompson to look properly at the risks involved and then organise the lifting operation properly put staff at needless risk.
"This sadly led to the painful and life-changing injuries suffered by this young man."
