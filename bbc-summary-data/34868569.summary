Cardiff could take over from Swansea as the home of Wales' tallest building, as plans for a 42-storey tower in the city centre are unveiled.

Standing more than 132m (433 ft) high, the building south of John Lewis would be home to around 450 students.
Developers Watkin Jones said there was "considerable support" for the "iconic building".
If approved by Cardiff council, it would be taller than Swansea's Meridian Tower, which is 107m (351ft).
Plans include a shop or cafe at ground level, and a "sky lounge" available for hire.
The application could be considered by Cardiff council's planning committee in spring or summer 2016 and the building completed in late summer 2018.
