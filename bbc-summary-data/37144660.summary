[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Alloa Athletic and Livingston maintained their winning starts to the Scottish League One season with victories over East Fife and Stenhousemuir respectively.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Livi moved top on goal difference with a 4-1 defeat of Stenny, while Alloa overcame the Fifers 2-1.
Airdrieonians were winners by a solitary goal against Stranraer, while Brechin and Queen's Park drew 0-0.
And it was 2-2 between Peterhead and Albion Rovers.
Danny Mullen scored two of Livi's goals, with Scott Pittman and Jackson Longridge also on target and Colin McMenamin converting a late penalty for Stenny.
Alloa, who claimed an eighth win out of eight competitive games this season, moved into a two-goal lead through Iain Flannigan and Greig Spence before Kevin O'Hara replied for East Fife.
Andy Ryan's 26th-minute goal proved to be enough for Airdrieonians.
Ross Stewart scored twice to bring Rovers back from 2-0 down against Peterhead, who had led through Ryan Baptie and Rory McAllilster.
Brechin City's draw against the Spiders means Darren Dods' side remain unbeaten in the league this season.
