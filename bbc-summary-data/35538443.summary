Kang Kang first appeared in a short promotional video for Chinese state broadcaster CCTV News in January.
Social media users quickly mocked his unusual looks, calling him "ugly", "tumour-ridden" and "freakish".
But it appears that netizens have had a change of heart after he didn't feature at all in CCTV's New Year extravaganza.
The annual variety show is a highlight of China's New Year entertainment, and is watched by some 700 million viewers.
"Where did you go, Kang Kang?" was the question on everyone's minds, as thousands took to the popular micro-blogging site Weibo over the Lunar New Year to express shock and "dismay".
"Where is Kang Kang? I'm worried," commented a Weibo user from Beijing. "Did people send him away because he was ugly? Now I am starting to feel bad, over a cartoon monkey!"
"Come back Kang Kang, I am sorry that I was so mean to you. You were not so ugly after all," said another user.
Many also began to share memes and personal art pieces dedicated to the missing monkey.
Kang Kang was designed by Chinese artist Han Meilin, who also created the 2008 Beijing Olympic mascots.
For now, he still remains on the network's official Facebook page, but users are continuing to speculate about what could have caused the monkey's disappearance.
"I think Kang Kang was subjected to the same treatment that dissidents get, whenever our Communist party becomes unhappy," remarked one Weibo user.
"Stay calm everyone, Kang Kang's tumour cheeks probably did not make it past security check," said another.
