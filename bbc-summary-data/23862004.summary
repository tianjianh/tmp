A further 26 people were injured when the two-storey factory, under construction in the Sao Mateus neighbourhood, collapsed.
Two of the 36 people who are believed to have been working in the building at the time are still unaccounted for.
It is not yet clear what may have caused the collapse.
According to city officials, the construction work did not have the necessary permits and two fines had been issued already in relation to the work carried out.
Edilson Carlos dos Santos, a lawyer for the owner of the site, blamed the engineering company hired to work on the building for the collapse.
Mr Santos said the company, Salvatta Engenharia, had been installing lift shafts and staircases at the time of the collapse on Tuesday.
The engineering company denied the allegations, saying in a statement that it had not yet received the keys to the building "because the works he [the owner of the site] had agreed to carry out had not been completed".
Some 60 rescue workers continue to search the site with sniffer dogs.
They dug holes into concrete walls with sledgehammers and removed metal sheeting in their attempt to find the missing construction workers.
Building collapses of this kind are common in Sao Paulo - Brazil's largest city - and particularly affect structures that are either poorly maintained or still under construction.
Home to 11 million people, Sao Paulo is one of 12 Brazilian host cities for next year's World Cup.
