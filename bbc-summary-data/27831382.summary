A man who spent more than ??500,000 transforming a former Essex council house into a "wonderland" has been forced to put it up for sale.

John Trevillian, 49, has spent 24 years working on his home, Talliston, in Great Dunmow.
But he lost his job on a magazine earlier this year and says he would not be able to keep up with mortgage repayments.
It has been put on the market for ??350,000.
Mr Trevillian said selling his house was a last resort, but he would like to find a buyer who sees its true value.
He bought the three-bedroom house in 1990 and decided to transform all the rooms after re-decorating the office.
The 1930s semi-detached property has been adapted into what Mr Trevillian calls "a wonderland of inspirational locations," including a voodoo kitchen, a Norwegian boathouse bathroom and a bamboo tree house in the attic.
"It has always been a case of setting out a plan and trying to achieve something people said was madness," Mr Trevillian said.
More than 1,650 objects have been brought back from 27 countries to decorate the house.
Different smells and soundtracks have also been incorporated into the designs of the rooms.
The project was planned to last 25 years, finishing in October 2015.
Mr Trevillian said he would continue to transform the property, where he lives alone, until he has to leave.
"As the house has gone on, I've loved it more and more. It's been the longest relationship of my life," he revealed.
An estate agent with Mullucks Wells said: "Out of the 9,000 homes I've inspected, and over 40 years in the business, this is the most extraordinary house I've ever brought to market."
