[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A "predatory paedophile" has been jailed for eight years after admitting 20 sexual offences involving children.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Duncan James Waterhouse, 45, from Keswick, committed the crimes over six years ending in February this year.
His offences involved four children and included sexual activity with a child and making a child watch sexual activity.
Carlisle Crown Court heard his crimes had "shattered" one child's future and left another as "merely a shell".
Judge Peter Davies said Waterhouse's behaviour "was corrupt, and the corruptness was yours".
A five-year extended licence period was attached to the sentence and Waterhouse must will be on the sex offenders' register indefinitely.
He must also abide by the strict terms of an indefinite sexual harm prevention order and will be barred from working with children and vulnerable adults.
Det Con Paul Scougal from Cumbria Police said Waterhouse was a "predatory paedophile whose actions were utterly perverse and deplorable".
Waterhouse admitted 12 counts of intentionally touching an underage child, four of causing an underage child to look at an image of a person engaging in sexual activity, two counts of causing an underage child to watch a person engaging in sexual activity and two charges of engaging in non-penetrative sexual activity with an underage child.
