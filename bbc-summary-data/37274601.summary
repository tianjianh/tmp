Lee Hodges: Truro City lacked leaders in 6-0 defeat by East Thurrock United

Truro City's lack of leadership on the pitch was exposed as they suffered their biggest home loss for a year, according to manager Lee Hodges.

City lost 6-0 to East Thurrock United on Saturday to drop to fourth-from-bottom in National League South.
"I'm looking for leaders and at the moment no-one seems to want to be a leader out there," Hodges said.
"I can hear myself on the sidelines screaming and shouting, but I can't hear too many others doing that."
The loss was Truro's worst since a 6-0 defeat by Oxford City in August 2015, which preceded a run of just two losses in their next 28 league and cup games.
But Hodges says he is worried that there did not seem to be the right reaction in the dressing room after their latest heavy loss, which came after conceding four first-half goals - including three in the space of eight minutes.
"That's what happens with a group of lads that don't have that fight about them at the moment," he told BBC Radio Cornwall.
"They're all just sitting in there looking around at each other, when you want people in there having their say.
"But no-one seems to be saying anything at the moment, there's just one voice and that's me at the moment who is trying to kick every ball and tackle every ball at the same time."
