[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Skipper Jamie Grimes got the hosts off to a perfect start, heading home from a corner in the fourth minute.
Nathan Arnold nearly found himself in a great position to equalise after 22 minutes, but his heavy touch made it easy for Dover goalkeeper Steve Arnold to race out and smother the ball.
That was as close as the visitors came as Moses Emmanuel doubled his side's lead with a clinical finish after 53 minutes.
