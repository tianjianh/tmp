Murderer Peter Kibisu admits rape of lawyer

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A mechanic has admitted raping a family friend who he then murdered at her home in August 2015.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Peter Kibisu, 23, sexually assaulted and strangled Elizabeth Nnyanzi, 31, in Harrow, north-west London.
Kibisu had been lodging with Miss Nnyanzi's family at the time.
He pleaded guilty to her murder in November last year but at the Old Bailey on Friday he also admitted raping her.
His admission came at a hearing intended to decide whether to proceed with a rape trial.
Following her murder, family members described Miss Nnyanzi as a "beautiful and talented" young woman, who had trained as a lawyer and taken up a job at a top firm shortly before her death.
They described her as a "young star" and said her death was a "huge loss to society".
Kibisu's lawyer told the court that his actions came like a "bolt from the blue".
Sentencing will take place next month.
