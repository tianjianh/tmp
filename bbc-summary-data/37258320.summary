Sam Martinez had followed the team since he first arrived in Edinburgh from Belize in 1945.
He died last month having finally seen the Easter Road club win the Scottish Cup for the first time in 114 years.
Mr Martinez's family said his love of Hibs had brought him "a lot of joy".
A family statement said: "The Martinez family would like to thank Hibernian FC, the club's supporters and the whole Hibernian community for the warmth and friendship shown to our dad during his time following the team. His love for Hibs brought him a lot of joy, particularly in his later years.
"Hibernian FC's honouring of our dad at last week's match against Greenock Morton meant so much to us and we will always treasure that wonderful commemoration of his life.
"We now need to grieve in private for the loss of our amazing father, grandfather and great-grandfather. Thanks again to everyone who has joined in the celebration of our dad's life and supported us through this time."
A Hibernian Football Club spokesman described Mr Martinez as "a lovely person who touched us all with his character and commitment to the club".
