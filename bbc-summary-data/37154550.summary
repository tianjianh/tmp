A one-liner about organ donation has been named funniest joke of the Edinburgh Fringe Festival.

Masai Graham won with the gag: "My dad suggested I register for a donor card, he's a man after my own heart."
The festival's best jokes were selected by a panel of 10 judges before being put to 2,000 people, who voted for their favourite.
Tim Vine, Stewart Francis and Zoe Lyon have previously won the competition, run by TV channel Dave.
Graham, from West Bromwich, claimed the victory after making the shortlist in both 2014 and 2015.
He said "It's an incredible honour to land Joke of the Fringe. Not bad for someone from West Brom!"
Comedian Stuart Mitchell came second in the poll, with the joke: "Why is it old people say 'there's no place like home', yet when you put them in one..."
Judges sat through an average of 60 different comedy performances and sifted through more than 3,600 minutes of material before selecting their favourite gags.
In a bid to judge only the quality of the joke, the name of the comic or their show is not revealed during the voting process.
Steve North, general manager of Dave, said: "The Fringe is renowned for being the best place to spot new and emerging comedy talent, and although there are some returning contenders in our top 10 this year, there is a high volume of new talent which is very exciting to see."
Voters also got to select their most "groan-worthy" jokes of the festival.
They included Adam Hess' one-liner: "In France, J-Lo is called 'I have water'", and Darren Walsh's gag: "What do you call three members of Abba in a French slaughterhouse? Abba trois."
