Well for 9-year-old George that dream came true when he was allowed on to the pitch at Everton and slotted home a cheeky goal.
He dropped into the Newsround HQ to tell us all about his experience.
George has cerebral palsy, a condition which affects how your muscles work.
Now he's beaten his idols to take the prize for the best goal of the month.
George himself became the fan's favourite when Everton supporters voted his goal as the best.
Check out his award winning goal.
