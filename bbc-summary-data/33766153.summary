A vigil was held on Monday evening for Jennifer Dornan, 30, a mother of three. She was found dead in her home at Hazel View, Lagmore, on Sunday 2 August.
Det Supt Kevin Geddes said she may have been killed before the fire was started.
"It is certainly my belief that whoever started the fire did so in order to destroy evidence," he said.
He said Ms Dornan left behind three children, all aged under nine, who do not understand what has happened to their mother.
He appealed for help from the public to catch her killer.
"Jennifer had been on a night out with friends at the Devenish complex on Finaghy Road North on Saturday night," they said.
"They left at around 1.30am and went back to a friend's house close to her own home to continue socialising. At 3am she left her friend's house and walked the short distance home.
"I am appealing to anyone who saw Jennifer in the bar on Saturday night or Sunday morning or who saw her walking in the Hazel View area between 3am and 4am on Sunday morning to come forward.
"I also want to hear from anyone who saw other people walking in the area around this time, particularly in Hazel View.
"At around this time, a small silver car is seen speeding away from Hazel View. This could be completely unconnected but we need the driver or any passengers to come forward."
Hundreds of friends and neighbours gathered to remember the dead woman on Monday evening.
Speaking shortly after the fire, Tanya Watson, Ms Dornan's friend, said: "She was the life and soul of everywhere she went - there's guys here this morning paying tribute to her who have only met her once, she made that much impact on somebody's life as soon as she entered it.
"This is huge loss to our community, she was involved in everything, every aspect, from community centres to youth centres she was involved and her kids were heavily involved, she put herself out there and made herself known and she was perfect."
