[SN]TITLE[SN]
Aberdeenshire councillors object to Aberdeen FC stadium plans

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Aberdeenshire councillors have objected to Aberdeen Football Club's plans for a new stadium.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The stadium and training facilities would be built at Kingsford, close to the Aberdeen bypass, near Westhill.
The ultimate decision is for Aberdeen City Council in the summer.
However, Aberdeenshire's infrastructure services committee - the authority is a consultee - narrowly voted to object to the stadium application after hearing a morning a debate on the issue.
Campaigners against the stadium staged a protest at the council's headquarters ahead of the meeting.
Concerns have included traffic and parking issues.
The club believes the new stadium is vital if it is to achieve a sustainable future.
