[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The man had confronted the group after they threw a firework at his house in Berryburn Place, Barmulloch, at about 00:45 on Sunday.
He was then racially abused and had bricks thrown at him before the youths ran off.
The victim was taken to Glasgow Royal Infirmary and released after treatment.
Police Scotland said officers were currently conducting door-to-door inquiries as well as examining CCTV.
Chf Insp Stevie Hazlett said: "This was a horrific attack on a family's home and a father who came out to protect them.
"It is absolutely essential that we trace the cowardly and despicable individuals responsible as soon as possible because this type of behaviour simply will not be tolerated in our community.
"Officers are following a number of lines of inquiry and I am confident that we will find the group of youths who did this, but we need the support of the local community to achieve this.
"If you have any information that could assist with our inquiries, no matter how insignificant it might be, please get in touch."
