The white BMW M4 was set alight at the Cotton Mill Brewers Fayre, off the A71 at the Moorfield roundabout, at about 21:40 on Wednesday.
Police said the 27-year-old owner of the car was with two friends in the restaurant at the time of the attack.
The car, which was worth a five-figure sum, was totally burnt out.
No-one was in the vehicle and no-one in the area was injured.
Police said CCTV showed two men beside the car just as it caught fire.
After the attack, the men, who were described as being of slim build and wearing dark or grey clothing, ran off towards the B7064 in the direction of Irvine Road.
Det Con David Gray, from Kilmarnock CID, said: "Whilst the motive for this incident has still to be determined, we believe it was targeted. However, that doesn't make it any less serious.
"Setting a car on fire, especially in a busy area like a restaurant car park, is very dangerous as it could easily have spread to other cars and buildings.
"Indeed a car parked next to the BMW, a blue Hyundai i10, was also damaged as a result."
He added: "Anyone who saw the attack on the car or who has information that will assist officers with their inquiry should contact Kilmarnock CID via 101 or Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111 where details can be given in confidence."
