The 19-year-old England youth international is a full-back and arrives at Tannadice with Ryan McGowan preparing to join Henan Jianye.
Knoyle joined the Hammers as a 13-year-old and is under contract with the east London club until the summer of 2017.
He will not be included in the home squad for Saturday's visit of Kilmarnock.
"He's a very bright prospect," said manager Mixu Paatelainen. "He doesn't have too much experience but he is a good player.
"He can play in a couple of positions, so he'll be a good addition to the squad."
United are bottom of the Premiership, 14 points adrift of Killie, Hamilton and Partick Thistle.
