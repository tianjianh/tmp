Wayne Esmonde, 35, had his face put on South Wales Police's Facebook appeal over an alleged assault.
But the picture shows shaven-headed Mr Esmonde posing for the camera looking wide-eyed and staring intently.
Mr Esmonde, who asked for officers to take the post down, handed himself in at Swansea Central police station on Thursday.
He had written on their Facebook page: "I am him. Not a very flattering mugshot.
"I'd appreciate it if you'd take this post down. Innocent until proven guilty and all that.
"I've spoken to my solicitor and they will advise me what to do next. Thanks."
Mr Esmonde, of Fforestfach, Swansea, was wanted in connection with an assault on 18 July and South Wales Police have since updated their Facebook post.
