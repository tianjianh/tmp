The drugs giant reporting an 8.3% fall in third-quarter profit, caused by slowing consumer spending
President Donald Trump proposed slashing the US tax rate on corporate and pass-through business profits to 15% from 35% or more.
The administration is determined to get the tax reform done by this year, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said.
The promise of a massive tax cut has been at the core of the post-election rally, which has driven Wall Street's indexes to record highs.
However, the rally has stalled of late due to a lack of clarity on Trump's policies and the failure of his healthcare reform bill.
