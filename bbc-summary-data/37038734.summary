The 29-year-old, who has started 96 top-flight matches since 2007, signed an extended Warriors contract in May.
"It is disappointing to lose someone of Chris' ability but we have players who can step up," high-performance director Nick Johnston told the club website.
Worcester's campaign begins on Saturday 3 September against champions Saracens.
