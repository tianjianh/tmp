Sergi Canos fired the Bees ahead, but two quickfire Marvin Sordell goals from corners and a Cauley Woodrow curler made it 3-1 at half-time.
Lasse Vibe and Canos netted to level things at 3-3, before Vibe and Jota struck twice within a minute to settle the game in Brentford's favour.
The defeat sees Burton drop to 21st, one point above the relegation zone.
Burton came into the game on a six-game unbeaten run but were behind after 10 minutes when Canos swept in from Romaine Sawyers' cross.
Burton then took control of the first period with Sordell capitalising from two set-pieces. He turned in after Woodrow struck the bar before converting from close range following another dangerous corner from Lasse Vigen Christensen.
Fulham loanee Woodrow then gave Burton a two-goal lead with a well-placed free-kick from just outside the area.
However, the game turned after the break with Vibe slotting home from Jota's set-up and Canos sliding in from a tight angle to make it 3-3.
Daniel Bentley saved from Michael Knightly and Jota struck the post, before the Bees claimed the points inside the final 10 minute as Florian Jozefzoon's cross set up Vibe to volley in and the Denmark international turned provider to set up Jota and complete the turnaround.
The win saw Brentford extend their unbeaten away run to four games, but earlier draws for Blackburn and Nottingham Forest and Bristol City's remarkable 4-0 win over Huddersfield mean Burton are just a point above Rovers with eight games remaining.
Burton manager Nigel Clough:
"It was a disastrous 45 minutes for us. As good as we were in the first half we were just as poor in the second.
"It's the same players and the same formation that has defended incredibly well over the last six and a half games.
"At 3-3 we have missed as good a chance as there is in the game. That's how close we were to turning it round ourselves."
Brentford manager Dean Smith:
"It's like this every other week! It came as no surprise to us.
"We knew that we were capable of scoring three goals in 45 minutes and we have got that belief in the team. At times our attacking play was hard for anybody to live with.
"Burton have been very organised and solid. I just thought that in the second half we moved the ball much quicker and our substitutes made an impact when they came on, bringing pace and energy to the game."
