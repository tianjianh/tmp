Stoke City must remain patient over the future of Marko Arnautovic as potential buyers decide whether to trigger a reported Â£12.5m release clause.

The 27-year-old Austria international finished top scorer for the Potters in the 2015-16 season.
He is on a four-year deal and tied to the club until June 2017, but Stoke are yet to come to an extended agreement with his Austria-based agent.
"He knows we want him to sign," chief executive Tony Scholes told BBC Stoke.
"We've been great for him and he's been great for us. (Manager) Mark Hughes and the rest of the staff all want him to sign. We believe that this is the best place for him.
"But Marko and his agent are biding their time. All I can say is they've not agreed anything yet. We hope he'll sign, but I still can't give a definitive answer."
The powerful Arnautovic enjoyed his most successful season since being signed for an undisclosed seven-figure fee from Werder Bremen in September 2013 - one of Hughes' first signings as Stoke boss.
In 110 appearances for the Potters, he has netted 19 goals, of which 12 have come this season.
