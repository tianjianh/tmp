Terror trial wife showed no sympathy with 'radical' causes

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A woman accused of plotting a terrorist attack in London has never shown any sympathy with extremist causes, a court has heard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Old Bailey heard family members of Sana Ahmed Khan did not approve of her relationship with Mohammed Rehman, 25.
The pair, both of Reading, are accused of buying ingredients for a home-made bomb, inspired by radical Islamist material online
Mr Rehman and his wife, 24, deny preparing acts of terrorism.
Giving evidence, Mrs Khan's mother said she brought her daughter up in a moderate Islamic household and that she "abhorred" the so-called Islamic State extremist group and did not even like to mention its name.
A cousin also told the court Sana Ahmed Khan had shown an increasing interest in Islam but never gave any indication of having sympathy with terrorist causes.
In text messages Ms Khan told her cousin she really wanted "to read up more on Islam" and said "I have to focus on bettering myself as a Muslim now".
He said she had shown an interest in Islam but not in a "radical" way.
The couple hid the fact they had married in an Islamic ceremony from Ms Khan's relatives as the family did not agree with her choice of husband, the court heard.
Previously the jury heard a "Jihadi John-style" hunting knife and dangerous chemicals for a large bomb were found at Mr Rehman's home.
Mr Rehman, of Radstock Road, also denies possessing an article for terrorist purposes.
The trial continues.
