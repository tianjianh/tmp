[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Interim manager Scott Ruscoe says New Saints will not underestimate their Champions League opponents despite being favourites to progress.

The Welsh Premier League champions face Gibraltar side Europa FC over two legs in the first qualifying round.
If Saints beat Europa, they will face Croatian side HNK Rijeka in the second qualifying round but Ruscoe is not getting ahead of himself.
"We're not thinking of the Croatian champions yet," Ruscoe said.
"First and foremost we're looking at these two games and really taking them seriously as we do any opposition.
"Our clear message will be - play your normal way, respect the opposition for what they've done but remember that we're the seeded team and they're the unseeded team.
"We'll be the favourites but I won't be pushing that to the players.
"We'll be telling them let's get the work done in the first leg and see that second tie out."
Saints play the first leg at their Park Hall home on 27 June, with the return leg on 4 July played in Portugal.
