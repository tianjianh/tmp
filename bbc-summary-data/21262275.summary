[SN]TITLE[SN]
Herefordshire and Shropshire churches win Heritage Lottery funding

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Eight churches in Herefordshire and Shropshire have been awarded £500,000 from the Heritage Lottery Fund to help pay for urgent repairs.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The largest amount, of more than £100,000, was awarded to the Grade I-listed St Michael's Church in Munslow, to fund work to its roof and stonework.
All of the churches are part of the Diocese of Hereford.
The diocese said about £200,000 still needed to be raised to complete repairs at the churches.
It said grants were vital with the cost of expensive heritage restoration projects often falling on small congregations.
Anson Crouch, who helped put a bid together for St Michael's Church in Munslow, said the church still needed to find £30,000 to complete its repairs.
"It is quite a challenge for a little parish like this. The population is less than 400," he said.
"Initially we want to make the church weatherproof and then we'll start to look on the inside."
The five Shropshire and three Herefordshire churches are all listed buildings, with many dating back to the 12th Century.
St Tysilio, in Sellack, will receive £75,000 towards structural work on its spire and tower, as well as repairs to stonework and some windows.
A £93,000 grant to St George's church in Milson is expected to help fund stabilisation work to walls, as well as re-roofing the chancel.
Other grants have been given to St Mary's in Cleobury Mortimer, St Michael's in Stanton Long, St Milburga in Stoke St Milborough, St Peter's in Pipe cum Lyde and St Mary the Virgin in Middleton on the Hill.
The work is due to be carried out over the next three years.
