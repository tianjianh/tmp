The Sauchiehall Street building was taken over by the Willow Tea Rooms Trust in 2014 and is being refurbished.
The Willow Tea Rooms inside was a separate business and had to relocate.
Its owner, Anne Mulhern, chose to recreate the Tea Rooms, which she has run since 1983, inside the nearby Watt Brothers store.
The Sauchiehall Street building and interiors were designed by Mackintosh and built in 1903 for Kate Cranston, who ran several tearooms in the city.
The Willow Rea Rooms Trust closed the building earlier this year for a major refurbishment which aims to restore the structure to its former glory.
Ms Mulhern opened her business there in 1983 after the building had been used as a retail unit.
She said it was "exciting" to be based at another building with a "fascinating history".
"Creating the new tea room has been a really exciting project and we have returned it to its original grandeur with a nod to Miss Cranston's original tea room designs," she said.
