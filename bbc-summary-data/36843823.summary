Marshall died at a hospital in Burbank, California, on Tuesday of complications from pneumonia following a stroke, his publicist Michelle Bega said.
Henry Winkler, who played "The Fonz" on Happy Days, wrote on Twitter: "Garry Marshall rest in peace.
"Thank you for my professional life. Thank you for your loyalty, friendship and generosity."
Several other Hollywood figures who have previously worked with Marshall have also taken to social media to pay tribute, including Steve Carell, Lea Michele and Zach Braff, who said: "God I loved this man."
As well as creating Happy Days, Marshall directed blockbusters such as Pretty Woman and Runaway Bride - both starring Julia Roberts and Richard Gere.
In a statement released on Wednesday, Gere said: "Everyone loved Garry... he was a super fine and decent man."
"He was a mentor and a cheerleader and one of the funniest men who ever lived. He had a heart of the purest gold and a soul full of mischief."
Actor Rob Lowe said: "Garry Marshall hired me at 15 years old. He gave my wife her start at 18, as a makeup artist. He changed our lives and many others."
Ashton Kutcher and Jessica Alba - both of whom worked with Marshall on the film Valentine's Day - also paid tribute, with Alba calling him "a true pioneer".
Octavia Spencer said she "will miss that talented one" and Ghostbusters director Paul Feig described Marshall as "an amazing person".
As well as creating Happy Days, Marshall wrote sitcoms such as The Odd Couple and Mork and Mindy.
The prolific director, producer and writer is survived by his wife, Barbara, and their three children.
Actress Sarah Paulson, who appeared in Marshall's 1999 film The Other Sister, said: "Garry Marshall, I am forever indebted to you. Thank you for taking a chance on me."
Mandy Moore, whose first on-screen film role was in 2001's The Princess Diaries, which Marshall directed, wrote: "Garry Marshall was one of the greats.
"He connected us all through joy, laughter, compassion and kindness. He also gave me my very first job."
