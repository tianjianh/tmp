[SN]TITLE[SN]
Labour MP Huw Irranca-Davies selected to fight assembly seat

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Ogmore Labour MP Huw Irranca-Davies has been selected to fight the seat at next year's assembly elections.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The ex-Wales Office and Defra minister is the first sitting Labour MP since 1999 to seek a move to Cardiff Bay.
Mr Irranca-Davies, 52, has been an MP since 2002, but said earlier this year Westminster was not the "be all and end all".
His selection comes as Labour AM Janice Gregory is standing down from the safe seat in Bridgend county.
The party has also selected teacher Vikki Howells to contest the neighbouring Cynon Valley seat.
Labour has held both seats since the first assembly elections in 1999.
Mr Irranca-Davies is already co-ordinating Labour's assembly election campaign for next May.
