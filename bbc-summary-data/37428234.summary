[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 32-year-old was driving home at about 22:30 on Sunday when she was forced to stop by a vehicle blocking the B6359 near Lilliesleaf.
There were two men at the scene and one of them opened her car door and struck her, leaving her bleeding.
They tried to drag her from the car but she managed to escape to her mother's farm nearby.
She believes the men wanted to steal her vintage Ford Cortina.
Police are attempting to gather both DNA and fingerprints from the car.
They said the attacker, who was wearing a white or light grey hoodie, spoke with a Borders or Edinburgh accent.
They have appealed for any witnesses who were on the B6359 on Sunday night to contact them.
A Police Scotland spokesman said: "A 32-year-old woman was driving home when a parked vehicle on the roadway forced her to come to a stop.
"At this time she was punched to the face by a male suspect before driving off and reporting the matter to police.
"Inquiries to establish the full circumstances are ongoing and anyone with information is asked to come forward."
