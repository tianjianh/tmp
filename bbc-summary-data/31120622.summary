A rhino's jawbone, dating back more than 700,000 years, has been discovered near a Norfolk beach.

It was found at West Runton, near Cromer, where one of the most complete skeletons of a mammoth ever found was uncovered in 1990.
The find was excavated by local geologist, Martin Warren, at the foot of a cliff last week.
"The teeth of rhinoceros are quite distinctive, I've seen them before but that was in 1984," he said.
Mr Warren said he had put the jaw in plaster casting to preserve it.
David Waterhouse, from Norwich Castle Museum, said he would be interested in seeing the jawbone.
"I'd like to have a close look at the teeth to see whether it was a new one [species] or one we have already seen," he said.
