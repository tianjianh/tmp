Jim Greatorex and grandson Emerson Fairclough, both from Warwickshire, got into difficulty on Saturday before Mr Cracknell's 11-year-old son raised the alarm.
Mr Cracknell's wife Beverley Turner reported that Emerson said "I'm seven. I'm too young to die" as her husband approached him in the water, .
Both grandfather and grandson left the scene uninjured.
Mr Greatorex, 67, from Stratford-upon-Avon, had gone into the water fully clothed to help Emerson when the Cracknells spotted them.
Croyde said: "I was on my body board kneeling up, I saw a man struggling and saw him saying 'my grandson's in trouble'.
"My dad was in the water next to me so he dived into the water David Hasselhoff-style and swam under the water, picked the boy up and dragged him to shore."
The 11-year-old described in an interview with BBC Radio 5 Live how he then spotted Emerson's grandfather also struggling.
He said he paddled up to him, gave him the surfboard, then swam back and told his father, who then helped Mr Greatorex back to the beach.
Ms Turner tweeted that the granddad said "that lad on that board saved my life".
She also tweeted: "You never know how your kids will respond in a crisis ... @croydecracknell was cool, quick thinking, kind and brave."
The drama unfolded on a beach in Croyde, North Devon, near the former Olympic champion's holiday home.
Mr Cracknell tweeted: "Eventful day with my little man on beach. Thankfully everyone safe, Good to be able to help & so proud of my lad."
Croyde admitted he had felt proud of himself: "It's not every day you rescue someone from drowning is it?" he said.
