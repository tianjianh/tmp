Organiser Glasgow 2014 said the first phase of the sale, which began on Wednesday at 10:00, had been busy with thousands of people securing tickets.
It said customer feedback had been positive and there were no queues.
Problems last week saw sales halted with only half of the 100,000 tickets on offer sold.
A spokesman for Glasgow 2014 said: "The ticketing website and hotline have both continued to be busy. We're pleased, however, to report that throughout the day queues have been minimal as thousands of customers have successfully secured tickets."
He added: "We have another big day tomorrow, with available tickets for athletics and racquet sports going on sale from 10:00."
Problems with last week's sale saw thousands of people facing hours of waiting as the official website struggled to cope. Others were unsure if transactions had completed.
A number of customers were also charged for an engaged tone when they tried to buy tickets over the phone.
After suspending sales and reviewing the problems with ticketing firm, Ticketmaster, Glasgow 2014 announced last week that tickets would be released over three days this week to try to prevent a recurrence of the website problems.
Team sports and ceremonies went on sale first on Wednesday, with athletics tickets being released on Thursday and all remaining tickets on Friday.
The ticket phoneline will be free and buyers will also receive free postage.
