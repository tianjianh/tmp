A collection of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles that lay in an attic for 35 years has sold for more than £5,000.

Dating from the 1980s, the 150 fighting turtles, still in their original packaging, caused "turtle mania", said auctioneer Tim Weeks.
They were put up for sale at Wessex Auction Rooms in Wiltshire by a former toy shop owner from County Mayo.
The humanoid fighting turtles caused a worldwide sensation when they were adapted for television in 1987.
Named after the Renaissance painters Leonardo, Donatello, Michelangelo and Raphael, the series coined the word "cowabunga" and sparked a fad for terrapins as pets.
When the craze took-off in the late 1980s, Mr Weeks said the shop owner had managed to get some of the "very first" heroes direct from the US.
"He was the only person to get the original run of these turtle figures in the whole country and he said he made an absolute killing through them," the auctioneer said.
"However, after a couple of months, the big chains in Ireland started to sell them and he put his remaining stock up in the attic."
With lots including "Muckman" - described as being scarcer as "no mums or dads bought it in the 80s" - Mr Weeks said the auction room had been "filled with turtle fans".
"It's been absolutely fantastic, they've all sold and at prices I didn't think were possible," he said.
"Having them in their original packaging does help, but even if they're loose you can still get good money for them."
The turtles had been expected to fetch about £4,000, but the lots eventually sold for a total of £5,200 at the auction house near Chippenham.
