The winner of the award, previously known as the Samuel Johnson Prize, will receive £30,000.
It aims to recognise high quality non-fiction works published in English.
It is open to books in the areas of current affairs, history, politics, science, sport, travel, biography and the arts.
Flanders, now a chief market strategist at JP Morgan Asset Management, said: "The Samuel Johnson Prize has helped changed the way we think about non-fiction writing in this country, with a yearly reminder that great books truly can come out of anywhere - and anything.
"Personally I'm delighted to be chairing the award in its new incarnation."
Prize director Toby Mundy said: "This is the beginning of a very significant new chapter in the story of Britain's most prestigious non-fiction prize."
Submissions will be accepted from 23 May, with the winner announced on 15 November.
