Dumfries and Galloway health board savings target rises

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
NHS Dumfries and Galloway has said it needs to find efficiency savings of £22.6m in the next financial year.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The revised figure is more than £3.5m above the previous estimate reported by the health board late last year.
Deputy director of finance Graham Stewart described the level of savings required as unprecedented.
The figure equates to about 7% of the region's health budget and is substantially higher than the board has ever previously achieved.
The total includes an anticipated savings shortfall of almost £5m which is expected to be carried over from the  current financial year.
Medical departments are being challenged to re-examine their approach to delivering efficiencies and identify new areas which could be reviewed.
The board has previously highlighted the costs of staffing medical vacancies and absences as one area of pressure.
A number of programmes being taken forward looking at reducing "waste and duplication" around drugs costs.
Getting rid of buildings the health board no longer needs is also being considered.
