[SN]TITLE[SN]
Aston Villa 1-0 Wigan Athletic

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Aston Villa edged within three points of the Championship play-off zone after leaving it late to beat manager Steve Bruce's old club Wigan Athletic.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Jack Grealish struck a late winner, firing home a right-foot shot from outside the box into the top right corner in the 88th minute.
A fourth successive home victory moved Bruce's Villa side up to 12th, while the Latics remain second bottom.
Villa had only won once in their eight previous home league games with Wigan.
It looked like the hosts were heading for their 11th draw in 20 games against a dogged Latics outfit, who have often caused them problems at Villa Park.
But an otherwise miserable game on a wet afternoon was finally lit up by England Under-21 international Grealish's late piece of brilliance.
The winner came just two minutes after his mounting frustration had caused him to become the last of the day's six bookings, for a foul on Jordi Gomez.
Undaunted, Grealish collected a loose ball at the other end before hammering a rising shot into the top-left corner of the net at the North Stand End - his first winning goal for the club.
It was well out of the reach of the helpless Wigan keeper, 41-year-old Jussi Jaaskelainen, who had earlier rescued his side with a key save from Villa top scorer Jonathan Kodjia.
After suffering his first loss since he arrived, at Leeds last Saturday, it was a great way for Villa boss Bruce to bounce back against the club he twice managed.
Aston Villa manager Steve Bruce:
"There is still a lot of improvement needed and we have to play better. It was a frustrating game for us masked by a great goal from Jack Grealish.
"He has now got me a goal and two or three penalties. In eight games, he has contributed massively.
"It was a difficult game for us. The more success we get teams are going to come and play like Wigan. But, if I'm honest, we gave away the ball too cheaply.
Wigan Athletic manager Warren Joyce:
"We gave Villa a run for their money. It took a great piece of individual skill from Grealish to score. But there was a free-kick for us only 20 seconds previously which makes the result more difficult to take.
"We stopped them with all their flair players. and were good value on the day. Unfortunately, you can't defend against individual brilliance and trickery such as that shown by Grealish.
"It is not doom and gloom. We have done well at a massive club and came very close to picking up a point."
