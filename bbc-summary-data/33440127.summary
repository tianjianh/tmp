L'Oreal's Helen Mirren ads cleared of airbrushing

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A L'Oreal advert starring Dame Helen Mirren has been cleared over claims the star's face was digitally retouched.

A viewer complained to the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) that the actress's wrinkles, specifically around her mouth, had been airbrushed.
L'Oreal responded with four red carpet images, demonstrating that Dame Helen's appearance was consistent with the commercial; and said no post-production techniques had been applied.
The ASA upheld the company's claims.
The advertising watchdog added that consumers would expect Dame Helen to have been professionally styled and made up for the photo shoot.
"We (therefore) considered that the ads had not altered Ms Mirren's appearance in a way that would exaggerate the likely effect that could be achieved by consumers' use of the product, and concluded that the ads were not misleading," they said.
In the TV ad, for the Age Perfect moisturising cream, the 69-year-old is offered a seat at a bus stop and looks unhappy, before saying: "Ever feel like you go unnoticed?",
After transforming her image, she adds: "It's the science I trust to help me look like me. Nourish and indulge your skin, and show those age spots who's boss."
A print ad featured an image of Dame Helen under the heading "Age Perfect" with accompanying text that read: "Age spots appear reduced. Skin feels nourished with moisture. Complexion looks more radiant."
Following the complaint, L'Oreal supplied the ASA with recent images of Dame Helen at events when she had also been professionally styled and made up.
They noted that the lines around the Oscar-winner's mouth were consistent in both the ads and the red carpet photos.
They also provided a list of post-production techniques that had been used in the print ad, none of which related to wrinkles or to the skin on her face or neck, and confirmed that no post-production changes were made to her face in the television ad.
The ASA concluded, "that the recent press images of Ms Mirren would have reflected a similar degree of professional styling and make-up as the images in the ad, without any post-production amendments, and that her appearance in the ads was comparable to those more candid images."
