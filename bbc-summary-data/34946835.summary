Payments to a college's Cardiff campus have been suspended after a BBC Wales' Week in Week Out investigation into fraud allegations.

Payments have been stopped to the West London Vocational Training College and its students in the Welsh capital.
Education Minister Huw Lewis said there were concerns over "unusual student recruitment trends".
The college said as far as it is concerned, all of its students are genuine.
The Cardiff branch runs various IT and business courses and has been designated as suitable to offer HND business courses, which attract tuition fees of Â£6,000 per student, funded by the Welsh government.
Students on those courses can also apply for Student Finance Wales loans and grants.
Week In Week Out has been investigating offers made by a local agent recruiting for the college.
Some students have been told by him they can use faked documents to access those loans and grants and they do not have to attend regularly to get the cash.
He also said if they do not go on to earn more than Â£21,000, they will not have to repay the money - which is true.
The college has denied any knowledge of that scam.
In a statement to AMs on Friday, Mr Lewis said: "Allegations have since come to light to suggest that one or more individuals within the college may have colluded with prospective students deliberately to defraud the student finance system by falsifying academic records and records of attendance at the college.
"I would expect any allegations of criminal activity to be referred to the police so that they may be investigated fully."
Pearson UK - which validates colleges - carried out a review of the Cardiff campus, visiting the site on 21 October.
The education minister said that "no substantive concerns came to light at that time".
