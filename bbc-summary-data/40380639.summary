Marsh, 33, will arrive in the UK on Sunday and could make his debut against Nottinghamshire on 7 July.
The county moved to sign Marsh after Travis Head was called into the Australia A squad.
"I've only heard positive things about from previous overseas players and can't wait to be involved," said Marsh.
Meanwhile, the club have confirmed captain Gary Ballance will be available for the first two days of the County Championship day-night match against Surrey, starting on Monday, 26 June.
Ballance, who has scored 815 runs at an average of 101.87 in the County Championship this season, has been called into the England Lions team for the game against South Africa which starts on Thursday, 29 June.
