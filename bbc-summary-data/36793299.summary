The 33-year-old man was attacked on Westmuir Street, near Parkhead Cross, at about 19:20 on Wednesday.
He was approached then assaulted by two men, which left him with laceration injuries. He was taken to Glasgow Royal Infirmary for treatment.
Police said the suspects ran off in the direction of Crail Street following the attack.
One of the men was white, aged 30 to 40, about 5ft 6in tall and had a dark beard. He was wearing a dark fleece jacket, dark jeans and navy boots.
Police said there was currently no information on the second man.
Det Con Eilidh Marshall said: "This is normally a busy area with people and traffic, so I'm sure there were people around at the time of the incident.
"A young man has been attacked for no apparent reason and we need to find out why this happened.
"I am appealing to anyone who was in the area around the time of the attack to contact us with any information which could assist in progressing our inquiries."
