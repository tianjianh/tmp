Voice-activated Zenbo will cost $599 (Â£409) and Asus says it will be able to control smart home devices.
The firm said it would be less expensive than competing household robots because it did not have humanoid features such as arms.
At this point, Zenbo is a work in progress and its release data has not yet been announced.
Cindy Sui was given an early demonstration in Taiwan.
