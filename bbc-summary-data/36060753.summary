The home side dominated at the John Smith's Stadium, with 18 shots in all.
City keeper Tomas Kuszczak excelled and saved an Emyr Huws header brilliantly before David Cotterill gave the away side the lead with a superb free-kick.
His curling effort looked to have won it but defender Lynch took control of a wayward shot in the area and netted his second of the season to earn a point.
With 65% possession and 15 corners to Birmingham's two on the day, Huddersfield will question why their own end-of-season form now boasts just three wins in 11 games.
Sat 16th in the table, their Championship status is secure and buoyed by a 2-0 away win at Blackburn last week and a draw at Rotherham on Tuesday, they began well, with Nahki Wells dragging an effort wide.
Birmingham captain Michael Morrison nearly turned into his own net and Joe Lolley went close for Town prior to Cotterill's 25-yard strike.
The Wales international scored the only goal in this fixture last season - another superbly-struck free-kick - but unlike then, Birmingham could not hold on and they stay ninth in the table.
Blues manager Gary Rowett said he had been "pretty tough" on his players for a "lack of desire " after they conceded a two-goal lead against Preston in midweek and again they squandered an advantage.
Lynch prodded the leveller and his side almost won it with Wells inches away from touching home a cross and Kuszczak brilliantly denying Karim Matmour's overhead kick at the death.
Huddersfield Town manager David Wagner:
"We had problems with our finishing and we need to do better.
"Our shots were not good enough and a lot were blocked or went wide. We did not make their goalkeeper work hard enough.
"I am disappointed with the result but when you come back with 10 or 15 minutes left you can be satisfied.
"In the last 10 or 15 minutes everybody can see our fitness was good and we were stronger than our opponent."
"We have shown a good fighting attitude."
Birmingham City's assistant manager Kevin Summerfield:
"It was a game where we needed to dig in and we looked to play on the counter attack but we did not have enough legs or quality.
"It was a set-piece that opened the door for us and Cotterill produced a great free-kick but that's what he does.
"We have been in the top 10 all season and we are not going to sit back and roll over.
"We still have an awful lot to play for and we want to win games."
