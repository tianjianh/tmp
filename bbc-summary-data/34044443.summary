Ebbw Vale's Monwel in liquidation with 38 jobs lost

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A road sign-making company that was run as a social enterprise and provided jobs for disabled people has gone into liquidation.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Monwel, based in Ebbw Vale, Blaenau Gwent, ceased trading last month, with 38 people made redundant.
Liquidators said the company failed because of a deficit of Â£400,000, high employment costs and reduced sales.
In May, the Welsh government hailed it as an example of good practice of communities running facilities.
