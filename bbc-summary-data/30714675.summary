[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The incident happened in Ochil Terrace, Dunfermline, at about 16:30 on Friday.
Police are appealing for witnesses. The man is white, in his early 20s with a round face. He was wearing a beanie-style hat, grey jogging bottoms and a puffa-style jacket.
A 19-year-old man has already been detained and a report has been sent to the procurator fiscal.
The flasher also had a bike with him.
Det Sgt Karen Muirhead, of Police Scotland, said: "While the victim was not physically harmed, she was understandably shocked and distressed by the incident.
"We are encouraging anyone who may have witnessed this or may have been a victim of a recent indecent exposure themselves to come forward and contact us immediately.
"This behaviour is unacceptable and we are eager to support anyone who may have been victim to this type of crime."
