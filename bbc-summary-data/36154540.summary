A second group of Syrian refugees have arrived in Northern Ireland as part of the UK's Vulnerable Person's Relocation Scheme.

Fifty-seven refugees, including 14 families and 20 children, arrived in Belfast on Thursday morning.
The families will spend five days in a special welcome centre before moving into their new homes.
The first group of Syrian refugees arrived in Northern Ireland in December 2015.
The new arrivals range in age from two years old to their late 50s, and several of the adults are believed to have university-level education.
The Department of Social Development (DSD) has direct responsibility for overseeing the operation of bringing the refugees into Northern Ireland.
One of the families will be housed in Belfast, while the remainder will be resettled in Londonderry.
Senior church leaders in Derry have said the arrival of the refugees is an opportunity for compassion.
"I think we've really all been moved by the terrible destruction that's gone on in Syria and in the wider Middle East region," said Bishop of Derry Donal McKeown.
"I think it's in the heart of the Derry people to be generous and to be welcoming. I don't doubt they'll be made very welcome here in the city and will enrich the educational experience of the children that we have here."
Church of Ireland Bishop for Derry and Raphoe Ken Good said people will want to make a difference.
"These lives have been thrown upside down, the catastrophe that has befallen so many of these families," he said.
"My vision is to look in 20 years time or so and that these children will say to us:  'We are so thankful that this city was the place we were sent, that this city welcomed us as they did, that this city turned our lives around and gave us a fresh start'."
The families will each be helped to find a home, a job and school places for their children.
The refugees are expected to live in Northern Ireland for five years, after which time they can choose whether to go back to Syria or apply for UK citizenship as long as they do not have a criminal record.
The families will be able to move freely across the UK, but will not be able to travel to the Republic of Ireland as laws regarding refugees in both jurisdictions are different.
Failure to adhere to this regulation could result in a criminal record.
It is understood that none of the first group of refugees to arrive in Northern Ireland have found employment.
