Battle of Northampton car park plan brings more than 100 objections

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
More than 100 objections have been lodged against a planning application for a car park at a golf club on the site of the Battle of Northampton.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Delapre Golf Club, in Eagle Drive, has attracted criticism from heritage organisations and concerned people.
The club said it had now carried out an archaeological survey for the 41-car site and found "nothing significant".
But the Northampton Battlefield Society said lead shot and a silver brooch found there were "very important".
In January the golf club illegally cleared an area thought to be near where the Battle of Northampton was fought in 1460 during the War of the Roses.
The battle is believed to have seen artillery used for the first time in a conflict in England.
The golf club stripped about 13ins (30cm) from the site before the borough council stepped in and ordered it be restored.
An archaeological assessment then discovered post-medieval lead shot, horse tack and a 14th Century silver annular brooch.
The planning application states these discoveries were of "no importance".
But the club said it would protect "any further archaeology below ground" found during car park work.
"A medieval brooch and potentially significant finds of round shot that could revise the understanding of the early use of handguns in England are detailed in the archaeological report," the battlefield society said.
"It is essential the whole battlefield be archaeologically investigated before any steps to develop the site damage this historical environment," it added, while calling for the application to be "rejected outright".
Other organisations objecting to the development include the Battlefields Trust, Tudor Society, Richard III Society, Historic Gardens and Naseby Battlefield Project.
Northampton Borough Council will consider the application at a planning committee meeting in September.
