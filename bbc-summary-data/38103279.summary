The Blackpool potter, 20, has won five of his 15 matches so far this season and fallen to 92 in the world rankings.
Cahill, who beat Chinese superstar Ding Junhui at the same event in 2014, said his "head was finished with the game".
"If I carry on like this I will pack it in at the end of the season," he said.
"I have had enough. I am practising and don't want to. It is hard work and I don't know what to say. I am just tired of the game."
Cahill said he would not be taking the decision lightly but had been thinking about calling time on his career for a while.
He has earned Â£11,625 in prize money so far this season and says he is fed up of borrowing money to enter tournaments and struggling to make a living.
He added to BBC Sport: "I am obviously only at the start of my career, but I feel like I have been playing for ages now. I feel like I am going round in the circles and bashing my head against a wall."
