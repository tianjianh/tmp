11th Night: Bonfire safety fears reignite debate

A large bonfire just yards from homes in east Belfast has reignited a debate about the practice of setting bonfires in built-up areas.

More than 35 firefighters worked for two hours on Saturday night to keep the fire near Chobham Street from spreading to nearby family homes and buildings.
The pastor of a church situated about 100 yards away said fire crews feared the church roof would catch fire.
But some local residents defended the bonfire as part of unionist culture.
Bonfires are traditionally lit in unionist areas after dark on 11 July, as part of the annual Twelfth of July celebrations.
The public holiday commemorates the victory of the Protestant King William of Orange over the Catholic James II at the Battle of Boyne in 1690.
However, at some bonfire sites, concerns have been raised about public safety in built-up areas, as well as the burning of some political and religious symbols.
Pastor Lucas Parks, whose church is close to the site of the Chobham Street bonfire, said fire crews had to hose his building down on Saturday night to protect it from the heat of the flames.
Speaking through tears to BBC Radio Ulster's Sunday News programme, the pastor said he was "saddened" by what he saw during the Eleventh Night celebrations.
"There are flags being burned and effigies being burned and... I was struggling to see how that could be a positive celebration of anything really," Mr Parks said.
"I mean, there's a statue of Mary on there [the bonfire] and I'm not Catholic but that's offensive to me."
He also criticised the burning of the Irish tricolour and political posters.
"In any other place people would think that would be some kind of a hate crime," he said.
The pastor objected to some residents having to move out of their homes, as the bonfire was set about 30 yards from their houses.
However, one elderly man in the street told the same programme: "It mightn't be the right place, but its the only place the kids have."
The resident said he understood there were safety concerns, but claimed the majority of his neighbours enjoyed holding bonfire celebrations in their area.
He also praised the response of firefighters in keeping the bonfire under control.
"They were needed - the fire brigade - here because I think a couple of the roofs nearly went on fire, but I'm for the kids," he told the Sunday News.
"Sixty years ago, I would have been along with the boys, because I was collecting wood 60 years ago myself, the same as the young lads now."
The man said the local community was "running out of places" to hold Eleventh Night celebrations.
"We grew up with bonfires, but every bit of spare ground now they are putting houses on it and we're running out of grounds.
"It's sad but years ago, you had six, seven, eight bonfires just in this avenue alone, and the same in the other avenue down below.
"Now we have one, but that's modern times I suppose."
