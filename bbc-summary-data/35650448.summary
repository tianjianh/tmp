Earlier this month, BBC Sport reported that United had held talks with representatives of the Portuguese.
Mourinho, 53, was sacked by Chelsea in December, seven months after winning the Premier League title.
Asked if he will replace Louis van Gaal at Old Trafford, Mourinho said: "That's the one million dollar question."
Speaking at a school in Singapore, he added: "Nobody knows and I am the first one not to know. I read so many different things."
Mourinho has been linked with a return to Serie A side Inter Milan and Spanish giants Real Madrid.
But he said: "Starting next season with a new club and project is probably the best for me."
The future of Dutchman Van Gaal, 64, has been an almost constant source of speculation in recent weeks.
His contract ends at the end of next season but the former Netherlands boss has been involved in a number of testy exchanges with reporters whenever his position is discussed.
United lie fifth in the Premier League, six points off fourth-placed Manchester City, and went out of the Champions League at the group stages.
They are through to the quarter-finals of the FA Cup and face Danish side FC Midtjylland in last 32 of the Europa League on Thursday, trailing 2-1 from the first leg.
