The 29-year-old, who will be available to play in all formats, will move to Lord's when his commitments in the Indian Premier League are finished.
The left-arm seamer played four matches in the T20 Blast for Middlesex last year, taking eight wickets.
"Mitchell made a really positive impression in 2015," managing director of cricket Angus Fraser said.
McClenaghan, who has played 23 Twenty20 internationals and 47 one-day internationals for the Black Caps, will predominantly play T20 cricket for Middlesex.
"Mitchell gets modern limited-over cricket and the fact a bowler needs to be deliberately unpredictable," Fraser added.
"He has the skills and mindset to be constantly competitive in these forms of the game."
Middlesex have already signed New Zealand captain Brendon McCullum to play one-day cricket this summer.
