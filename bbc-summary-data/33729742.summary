The maker of the A380 jumbo jet said that revenue rose 6% to €28.9bn (£20.3bn).
Airbus also recorded a €290m (£204m) net charge relating to its A400M programme, following the crash of the military craft on a test flight in May.
The company said it has worked with all its partners to resume flights and deliveries.
"However, the accident caused setbacks on qualifying enhanced military capability and the schedule of planned deliveries," the company said.
Airbus has said it is still committed to the A400M military plane.
The company said its profit forecast remained in place: "Revenues, profitability and cash generation all improved, and the overall financial performance means we are on track to deliver our 2015 guidance," said Tom Enders, chief executive officer of Airbus.
The company's shares climbed more than 3% in Paris trading.
