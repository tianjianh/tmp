The shortlist, which features 15 albums, was announced on Saturday.
Now in its fifth year, the competition, created by BBC Radio 1 DJ Huw Stephens and music promoter John Rostron, aims to promote the best original music from Wales.
This year features more Welsh-language releases than ever before.
The Welsh Music Prize ceremony will be held on 26 November at Sherman Cymru in Cardiff.
Stephens said: "It's been another great year for Welsh music, with a diverse and strong list of albums making the shortlist.
"There's great songwriting, Welsh-language records, folk, electronica and world-conquering rock on the list."
