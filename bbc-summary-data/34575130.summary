An official report by HM Inspectorate of Prisons (HMIP) found the jail in Walton to be "dirty, overcrowded and poorly equipped".
HMIP said the prison, where there have been 11 deaths, has "deteriorated dramatically" with drug use, staff assaults and self-harm.
The Howard League for Penal Reform said the report makes for "grim reading."
The HMIP report followed an unannounced 11-day visit in May and found a "worrying" three-fold increase in staff assaults,
Mark Fairhurst, a prison officer, told the BBC he believed at least one recent death was due to the legal high "Spice".
The Howard League, a charity that campaigns for prison reform, said 10 men had died in the preceding 14 months and another died shortly after the inspection. The HMIP report said three deaths were self-inflicted.
Frances Crook, chief executive of the charity, said a "lack of managerial oversight" meant prisoners spent hours "locked inside their cells" and "these are the symptoms of a prison system that has been in meltdown".
She said staff were "working under intolerable pressure as prison conditions have deteriorated".
The HMIP report found health provision has "deteriorated dramatically" during 2014 and was the subject of a number of interventions.
Sex offenders located in the first-night centre felt "unsafe" because of their proximity to mainstream prisoners.
Nick Hardwick, the Chief Inspector of Prisons, said: "Throughout this report we have noted a series of backward steps.
"The prison has many longstanding problems to deal with and we acknowledge that urgent issues concerning health and to an extent the number of deaths in custody were being addressed."
He said there were pockets of good work but managers and staff need to "get a better grip on issues".
The Ministry of Justice said: "Prisons should offer offenders the chance to get the skills and qualifications they need to turn away from a life of crime."
Michael Spurr, chief executive of the National Offender Management Service, said the governor and staff at Liverpool are determined to improve and action is being taken.
"The Victorian environment is challenging," he said.
"But as the chief inspector makes clear - Liverpool is 'not a fundamentally poor prison' and I'm confident the action being taken will deliver real progress over the coming months."
