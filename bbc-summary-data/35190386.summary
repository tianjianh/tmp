Which of these dream boxing matches will come true in 2016?

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
If 2015 proved one thing, it's that miracles can happen in the cynical world of boxing - and if Floyd Mayweather and Manny Pacquiao finally got it on after years of wrangling, surely anything is possible? Yes. And no.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Of the 10 fights on BBC Sport's 2015 wish list, three came off and one - Carl Frampton v Scott Quigg - was signed, sealed and is set to be delivered in 2016. But that still makes for a lot of broken dreams.
BBC Sport looks at the global super-fights and domestic dust-ups that could happen in the next 12 months, while offering the following disclaimer: expect nothing, because boxing is madder than ever.
If Fury beats Wladimir Klitschko in their summer rematch - and it is still a big 'if', especially if Klitschko remembers to throw a few punches this time - the clamour for the Englishman to fight Deontay Wilder will continue to grow.
With WBA and WBO champion Fury having ruled out a clash with the returning David Haye and Anthony Joshua at least 18 months away from a world title tilt, a unification bout with WBC champion Wilder would seem to make perfect sense. Boxing politics, however, is likely to nix it.
Probability: 2 out of 5
While Sheffield's Brook was establishing himself as one of the world's most dangerous welterweights, Bolton's Khan was busy wishing away some of the best years of his career. A dream fight against Floyd Mayweather never materialised, while Manny Pacquiao has overlooked Khan in favour of a third match with Timothy Bradley.
Brook's promoter Eddie Hearn says he expects the long-awaited showdown between these bitter cross-Pennine rivals to take place at Wembley Stadium in June. It would be an even-money fight and has the makings of a classic.
Probability: 4
Golovkin has long been considered one of the most dangerous men in boxing, it's just that he's had nobody to test his potential greatness against. But Mexican beast Alvarez would appear to be just the man. And what a fight it would be.
Alvarez outpointed Puerto Rican legend Miguel Cotto to claim the WBC middleweight title in his last fight, while WBA and IBF title-holder Golovkin knocked out three more opponents in 2015, taking his tally to 31 in 34 fights. Expect both men to engage in tune-ups before settling in for talks.
Probability: 4
After years of tortuous negotiations, Belfast's Frampton and Bury's Quigg will finally meet in Manchester on 27 February. Recent form suggests there is little to choose between the super-bantamweight rivals, so it should be a cracker.
There is a rematch clause in the contract, so IBF champion Frampton and WBA champion Quigg will be expected to do it all again in Belfast in the summer. After which, who knows, there might be a decider.
Probability: 4
Welshman Selby was brilliant in beating Evgeny Gradovich and securing the IBF featherweight title, less so in defending against Fernando Montiel. But that didn't dampen enthusiasm for a match against Leeds folk hero Warrington.
Rumours abound that Selby will fight Warrington in Leeds in the summer. Selby the stylist against the all-action Warrington, who has arguably the most vociferous set of supporters since Ricky Hatton, has the makings of an intriguing - and very loud - domestic encounter.
Probability: 3
This is the third consecutive entry on the BBC's annual wish list for the light-heavyweight division's two main men. Russia's Kovalev and Canada's Stevenson have been calling each other out for years now and it is beginning to get a little bit boring.
Kovalev, owner of the WBA, IBF and WBO belts, fights tough Canadian Jean Pascal in January, while WBC champion Stevenson has nothing scheduled. The fact they fight on rival television networks has proved problematic, but Kovalev's people are hopeful the fight will happen in the summer.
Probability: 3
Some think Ward is the best pound-for-pound boxer in the world. It's just that he doesn't box that often. However, the American, a former super-middleweight world champion, says he will campaign at 175lb from now on. More importantly, Ward and Kovalev are both signed to American network HBO.
Both men are unbeaten and it would be a perfect match-up between knockout artist - Kovalev has 25 from 29 fights - and technical wizard - Ward has a habit of making world-class opponents look ordinary. The fight is slated for the end of the year, although Kovalev might have to beat Pascal and Stevenson first.
Probability: 3
Crolla provided one of British sport's feel-good stories in 2015, recovering from career-threatening injuries to land the WBA lightweight title at the second time of asking. Meanwhile, fellow Mancunian and good friend Flanagan was brilliant in knocking out Diego Magdaleno and defending his WBO crown.
Should Flanagan see off Liverpool's Derry Mathews in February, a unification match with Crolla would be a big money-spinner. But promotional differences - Crolla is with Hearn, Flanagan with Frank Warren - are likely to prove insurmountable.
Probability: 1
Saunders gave an impressive exhibition of technical boxing to dethrone Ireland's WBO middleweight champion Andy Lee, before being called out by arch rival Eubank Jr, who narrowly lost to Saunders in 2014.
However, Eubank Jr has since said he would prefer to go down the WBA route, while Saunders doesn't sound particularly keen to get it on again either. All in all, this is a fight that might make more sense a couple of years down the line.
Probability: 2
If you want proof of the capricious nature of boxing, look no further than the inter-connected careers of DeGale and Groves: Groves beat DeGale in the amateur ranks in 2007; DeGale won Olympic gold in 2008; Groves beat DeGale in the pro ranks in 2011; Groves lost two world title challenges against Carl Froch in 2013 and 2014; DeGale won a world title in 2015, before Groves lost again.
Groves says he came close to retiring after losing a third world title challenge against Badou Jack last September, but will return in January. DeGale, who was impressive in defending his title against Lucian Bute last November, will be an interested observer.
Probability: 2
