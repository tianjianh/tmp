[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A paedophile from Ireland who did not attend his child sexual assault trial in Oxford has been sentenced to 10 years and nine months in jail.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Thomas Nash, 70, of Fedamore, County Limerick, was arrested in May 2015 over historical child sex offences which occurred between 1997 and 2001.
When he failed to appear at court in May 2016, a European Arrest Warrant was issued and he was extradited.
Nash abused two girls aged four and seven at the time.
Nash was convicted of five counts of indecent assault of a girl, and one count of gross indecency to a girl under the age of 16.
The offences took place in Bicester, Oxfordshire and Hampshire.
He was initially arrested in Oxford and was sentenced at the city's crown court on Tuesday.
A spokesperson for the NSPCC said: "Nash probably thought he got away with his crimes but his victims have shown immense bravery in speaking out and helping to bring him to justice.
"Devious offenders like Nash will be held to account no matter how long ago the abuse happened."
Thames Valley Police investigating officer Det Con Kelly Gilbert said: "Mr Nash failed to turn up for his trial in May 2016 which caused unnecessary stress for all involved.
"On behalf of Thames Valley Police, I would like to thank the victims for their patience and for being so courageous in coming forward."
