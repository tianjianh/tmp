George Georgiou, whose previous destinations include Turkey, Serbia and Ukraine, has not visited the town before and says he has no preconceptions of what it will be like.
"The only thing I know about Ipswich is the football club," he said.
"Every journey will be a complete exploration and mystery to me, which is the perfect way to approach something."
Georgiou's residency on the buses around Ipswich is a continuation of a project he did in his hometown of London, and before that a study of people on public transport in Ukraine following the 'Orange Revolution' protests.
"I travelled through Ukraine on buses, trains, trams, and trolley buses - photographing people going to work, going home," he said. "If you take the bus you end up going into areas you have no reason to normal go into."
His photos from the buses in London show people carrying about their daily routines, and are intended to leave the viewer with room for their own interpretation.
"The things I'm really interested in are those fairly every day mundane things, but they're so loaded with meaning," Georgiou said.
"They're open-ended scenarios, what I call little micro dramas, or mini soaps. There's an image where you're looking into a pub - it's like a film scene but you imagine the scenario yourself."
Georgiou will arrive in Ipswich on Monday and the resulting photographs will feature in the PhotoEast festival, which launches in May.
"Ipswich will be really interesting - the whole place will be new to me," he said.
"I used to research projects before I went but I found that over the years you're going in there with a preconceived idea of the place, and I think you're further away from the truth."
