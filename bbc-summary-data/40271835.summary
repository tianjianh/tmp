The world number two will play at Dundonald Links the week before The Open at Royal Birkdale in July.
McIlroy, 28, has been troubled by a rib problem this year but insists he is "totally fine" to play in this week's US Open at Erin Hills, Wisconsin.
The four-time major winner will be making his first Scottish Open appearance since 2014.
He withdrew from the 2015 event at Gullane after picking up an injury playing football.
"I'm going to play (the) Scottish, so I'm going to play Irish (Portstewart), Scottish and The Open, which is a great links run," said the Northern Irishman.
"I don't know much about Dundonald. I know it's close to Troon. That's really about it. I know I can drive there. Having to get the boat from Larne to Troon will be fine."
