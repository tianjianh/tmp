Planned surgery was put on hold and a "major incident" was declared at Addenbrooke's Hospital on Friday.
Part of the hospital's basement, where sterilisation equipment is kept, was flooded following torrential rain.
A spokesman said the hospital was still in a "critical" condition. Cambridgeshire Fire Service received 54 emergency calls related to flooding between 00:00 and 05:00 BST on Friday.
A spokesman for Cambridge University Hospitals, which runs Addenbrooke's, said: "We have stood down from major incident mode... but the situation remains critical.
"The position of our sterile services department is improving and has allowed us to undertake some prioritised surgery.
"As a result we can now receive major trauma, vascular and surgery patients, which has enabled us to deescalate from 'major incident' status."
The spokesman apologised to people who had operations cancelled and said the hospital expected to be back to normal later in the week.
