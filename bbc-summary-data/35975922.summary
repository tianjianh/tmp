A pub-goer had a lucky escape when a ceiling collapsed and a light fitting crashed down on to a table she had moved from just moments earlier.

The drama unfolded in The Alex pub in Southend, Essex, on Tuesday night, YourSouthend reported.
Kayleigh Johnson, 28, said she heard a "massive crash" before the ceiling came "tumbling down".
No-one was injured in the incident, and the pub's owners said specialist contractors were assessing the damage.
Mrs Johnson said: "It was so lucky. Where it happened was right near our old table, and the bar.
"If someone had been ordering a drink, they would have been right underneath where it happened."
Mrs Johnson said a light had come down too and only red lamps were left on.
Staff then helped people evacuate the "rammed" pub, which was recently refurbished at a cost of Â£300,000.
The cause of the collapse has not yet been established.
"We couldn't see anything because it was really quite dark and it was so dusty," Mrs Johnson said.
"The staff upstairs were very good. They got people out promptly."
General manager Andy Pipe said normal business would resume as soon as it was safe to do so.
