Bell, 24, kicked 19 points as Irish won the first leg of their Championship play-off final against Yorkshire Carnegie 29-18 on Wednesday.
The Exiles are hoping to make an immediate return to the top flight after relegation last season.
"Hopefully we can give the fans the reward next week," Bell told BBC Sport.
He added: "It's been a tough year for them and they've come out in their numbers to support us."
Despite Irish holding an 11-point lead going into the return leg at the Madejski Stadium, Bell is prepared for another tough test against Yorkshire.
"We know the job's only half done," the former Leicester Tigers player said.
"We've had some great battles this season with Yorkshire, we've got one more to go and we're really looking forward to it."
Bell agreed his move to Irish before their relegation was confirmed last season and, having scored 229 points so far in the Championship campaign, he is hungry to get back to the top flight.
"As a still youngish player, I want to play at the highest level for as long as I can, play against the best players in the country and compete at the level," he said.
"That's the goal for us as players at the club and it would be a huge deal to put it back up where it belongs."
