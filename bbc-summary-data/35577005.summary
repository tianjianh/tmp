Two people were also badly injured when the vehicle ploughed into the group in Nailsea, near Bristol on Sunday.
The Volvo hit two men, Alex Gould, 18, and a 20-year-old and then struck a man and a woman before smashing into a telegraph pole, at about 05:00 GMT.
Two men and the woman were taken to Southmead Hospital where Mr Gould died, Avon and Somerset police said.
The man Mr Gould was with is in a critical condition, but the fourth person hit by the car - a man who was walking with the injured woman - was treated at the scene but did not require hospital treatment.
Police said the victims, who were in two groups of two, were were walking along Clevedon Road near the fire station when the crash happened.
The road was closed for most of the day on Sunday as police carried out an investigation at the scene.
The 22-year old male driver, from north Somerset, was arrested on suspicion of causing death by dangerous driving, driving a motor vehicle while above the alcohol limit; and possession of a controlled Class A drug.
Mr Gould's family said he was "the perfect son, brother, nephew, grandson and cousin".
