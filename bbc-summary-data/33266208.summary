Sports car maker McLaren Automotive has reported a three-fold rise in profits driven by more sales in Asia.

The company said pre-tax profits rose to £15m in 2014, up from £4.5m the previous year.
The British firm's rise in profits was helped by a 67% rise in sales to £475.5m, up from £285.4m the previous year.
It saw the biggest rise in Asia, where sales have increased by 80% over the past two years.
The company delivered 1,649 cars last year, and chief executive Mike Flewitt told the BBC that it was  aiming to increase production this year to 1,800 cars.
Mr Flewitt told BBC 5 Live that the US remains the company's biggest market, but Asia is growing fast and there is a big difference in the age of customers in the different markets.
In Asia, for example, many of those that buy a McLaren car are in their 20s and 30s.
