A warning has been issued after two men fell ill after taking what are thought to be "pink teddy bear" ecstasy tablets.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
North Wales Police said one man, from Gwynedd, was very ill and in intensive care. Both have since recovered.
Wrexham Maelor Hospital consultant Hywel Hughes said there had been an increase in people falling ill after taking psychoactive substances.
The pills are the shape of a teddy bear and a faded pink colour.
Dr Hughes said: "You cannot know what these substances contain and they can be deadly."
