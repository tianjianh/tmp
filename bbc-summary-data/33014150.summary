Investigators looking into the death of a Fife man in police custody have confirmed that the arresting officers have agreed to provide statements.

Sheku Bayoh, 31, was held following an incident in Hayfield Road, Kirkcaldy, on 3 May but died in custody.
His relatives claimed they were told five versions of what happened.
The Police Investigations and Review Commissioner (PIRC) said they had made several attempts to get statements from the officers concerned.
A spokeswoman said: "The PIRC has been leading on the investigation into the death in custody of Sheku Bayoh and since the hours following his death on Sunday 3 May 2015, has made several attempts to secure statements from the arresting officers.
"Those officers have now agreed to provide statements to the PIRC and now that the PIRC is in the process of gathering the material, it will be considered along with the information already gathered throughout the course of the investigation to date."
Last month family lawyer Aamer Anwar said Mr Bayoh, who had two young sons, was a "well-liked, peaceful and healthy young man" who had no previous history of violence.
Earlier this week a Scottish Police Federation lawyer said Mr Bayoh's family had promoted a "completely inaccurate and misleading account" of the initial incident and what followed.
Peter Watson of PBW Law said on Tuesday: "The officer injured remains off work, has had several hospital visits and is now in rehabilitation.
"An examination by a leading consultant confirms her injuries were significant. The injuries have been documented and photographed.
"The officers involved have never refused to provide statements. It was agreed at the outset with the Police Investigations and Review Commissioner (PIRC) that they would revert to us when they wanted statements and when they were clear on the basis that statements were to be given."
In response, Mr Anwar said: "This case is about the death of a young man Sheku Bayoh and his family have every right to seek answers.
"PIRC told us from day one, that the nine police officers had refused to speak to them or even provide statements since the 3rd May, that has now been confirmed by PIRC as the truth and vindicates the family's position."
Mr Anwar added: "The Bayoh family are deeply upset and angry that they have been accused of being liars. I would have hoped that those representing Police Officers would have checked the actual facts before attacking the family and myself so publicly."
