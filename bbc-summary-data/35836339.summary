Angela Wrightson death: Girl 'in control of actions'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A teenage girl who killed a vulnerable woman was in control of her actions, a court has heard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Angela Wrightson, 39, was beaten to death in her home in Hartlepool, Teesside, in December 2014.
Two girls, then aged 13 and 14, deny murder.
The older one has admitted manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility, but the court was told her recognised mental condition would not have impaired her understanding.
Forensic psychiatrist Dr Kenny Ross told Leeds Crown Court that the girl, now 15, had displayed rational behaviour on the night of the attack.
"[The older girl] lied about why her clothes were bloodstained, which in terms of avoiding repercussions was a rational action.
"She also hid in Angela Wrightson's bathroom when there was a disturbance at the front door, which was a rational action," Dr Ross said.
Earlier, the court heard from defence psychiatrist Dr Indranil Chakrabarti, who said the attack carried out by the girl was caused by a mental condition called Other Mixed Disorder of Conduct and Emotions.
Dr Ross agreed with the diagnosis but said the disorder did not cause her actions, and any impairment of her mental functioning was "minimal".
He also told the court because the attack "had a stop-start nature" and a variety of weapons were used, "a degree of self-control  and choice was evident".
The case continues.
