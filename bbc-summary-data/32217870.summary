Ipswich Town left back Tyrone Mings, 22, published a text message exchange between him and his mother on his Instagram account.
His mother thanked him for wiping "all my debt away", with Mings replying she deserved "every penny" and saying: "This is why I do it."
A club spokesman said it was a "private matter between Tyrone and his mum".
The player won praise on the social networking site, with one person calling him a "hero" and someone "who all children should look up to and aspire to become".
It is not the first time the footballer has expressed his generosity.
Last July, Mings offered via Twitter to buy new shirts for fans who had his old squad number stamped on their new kits.
Four months previously, he gave  two match tickets to a fan after he complained he had no money.
Mings, who comes from Bath, joined Ipswich Town in 2013 after the manager saw him play for just an hour with non-league side Chippenham Town.
He has been linked with a big money move to Premier League giants Arsenal.
