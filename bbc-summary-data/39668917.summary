Crossmichael phone box takes on new life as a library

A village phone box in southern Scotland has taken on a new life as a mini library.

BT is scrapping hundreds of boxes across the country after usage dropped by 90% over the past decade.
However, residents in Crossmichael decided to take advantage of the "Adopt a Kiosk" scheme to take theirs over for the cost of just Â£1.
Jane McCarthy, a member of the team responsible, said it could hold between 150 and 200 books.
"We talked to villagers and people came up with ideas as diverse as a bird observatory, a fish tank and even holding a defibrillator," she told BBC's Radio Scotland's Good Morning Scotland.
"We have a defibrillator in our village shop already so we decided to choose a library.
"People will be able to borrow, to exchange books and donate books 24/7."
The Wee Book Hoose was officially launched on Friday after the conversion works took place.
"It looked very grey and sad when we first took a look inside," said Ms McCarthy. "But it has been beautifully painted red."
It is now open for business and already appears to be proving popular.
"One wee boy in the school said to me: 'What would it be like if I took all the books?'," said Ms McCarthy.
"I said: 'Well, you might need a barrow, but I am sure we will find books to replace the ones you have taken.'"
