Manchester United midfielder Juan Mata is set to miss the remainder of the season following groin surgery.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Spain international had an operation last month but had hoped to play again this term.
However, United boss Jose Mourinho confirmed the 28-year-old, who joined from Chelsea in January 2014, would not be fit until the end of May.
Defenders Phil Jones and Chris Smalling will not return until mid-May, Mourinho added.
The Premier League season ends on 21 May.
Should United progress to the Europa League final, that match would be played in Stockholm on 24 May.
