Rodney Parade, the Exiles' home that they share with rugby sides Dragons and Newport RFC, is having a new Desso pitch installed after the Welsh Rugby Union takeover of the Dragons.
The Football League [EFL] has agreed to postpone home games until 26 August.
The schedule will be announced on 21 June. Clubs can reverse fixtures to face Newport, or opt for postponements.
The EFL seasons begins on the weekend of 4-6 August.
Newport will also play away from home in the first round of the Carabao Cup. In the event of Newport being drawn at home, the EFL has agreed to reverse the fixture.
The playing surface at Rodney Parade has been a long-discussed issue and is widely considered to be one of the worst in the Football League.
Three Exiles fixtures were abandoned or postponed at Rodney Parade during the 2016/17 season.
"Last season we had our issues with the pitch. So the fact that the FL have agreed to work with us and support us in what we have asked of them with the fixtures, is great," Newport chairman Gavin Foxall told BBC Wales Sport.
"We'll go from having what was I think termed as the worst pitch in League Two to probably one of the best playing surfaces in League Two.
"It's for everybody. We look like we are going to go from having a parks pitch of last year to one of the best playing surfaces which is great for the players and the fans."
