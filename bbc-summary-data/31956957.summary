The American's win in Meribel brought her an 18th crystal globe - awarded for winning a World Cup discipline.
It also leaves the 30-year-old with 66 career World Cup wins and third in the overall World Cup standings.
"It's incredible," said Vonn. "To come back this year to get the downhill title again and to have an amazing season means so much."
She now shares the record for the most downhill titles with Austrian Annemarie Moser-Proell.
Vonn is already the most successful female World Cup Alpine skier of all time, despite suffering two serious knee injuries.
Earlier this year, she overtook Moser-Proell's 35-year record of 62 career World Cup wins in a super-G race in Italy.
Anna Fenninger of Austria and Slovenia's Tina Maze remain ahead of Vonn in the overall World Cup standings with three disciplines to go.
Meribel is the final World Cup meeting of the season.
