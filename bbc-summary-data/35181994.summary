Motherwell were due to be at Tannadice and St Johnstone at Firhill, but the top-flight games were called off after Saturday morning pitch inspections.
The Championship match between Raith Rovers and Alloa Athletic is off, as is the game at Cowdenbeath in League One.
The League Two fixture at Arbroath failed an 11:00 inspection.
East Stirlingshire were due to be the visitors at Gayfield Park.
Albion Rovers were due to travel to Cowdenbeath's Central Park.
Partick Thistle announced on social media around 11:30 that their pitch had failed an inspection.
The match at Tannadice was postponed following a 10:00 inspection, with Motherwell stating on their website: "Extremely heavy overnight rain, together with a bleak forecast for the rest of the day, forced the match official to call the game off."
No new date has been announced yet for the game between United, who sit bottom of the Premiership, and Motherwell, who are third bottom but 11 points ahead of the Terrors.
However, Raith Rovers' match against Alloa will now take place on Tuesday 12 January with a 19.45 kick-off.
