The charity said it hoped the programme would identify almost 300 cases over two years.
Lung cancer is the most common cause of cancer in Yorkshire, with about 4,500 people diagnosed each year.
The trial, which is due to start in 2018, will focus on smokers and ex-smokers aged 55-80.

deaths compared to the England average of 61
Project leader Dr Matthew Callister, Consultant in Respiratory Medicine at Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust, said: "If lung cancer screening was introduced across Yorkshire, hundreds of lives could be saved every year."

It added the average cost of treating a patient with lung cancer ranges from £7,952 if diagnosed at Stage 1 to £13,078 if diagnosed at Stage 4.
Kathryn Scott, interim chief executive of the charity, said: "This is a unique opportunity to bring the very latest technology in lung cancer diagnosis to Yorkshire so it can be used for the people who need it most."
The charity is investing a further £1.8m in four other projects:
