Sally Adey, 57, of Caynton, Shropshire, was one of more than 20 people killed at the National Bardo Museum in Tunis on 18 March.
The mother-of-two was on an excursion from a cruise ship with her husband Robert, 52, who survived the attack.
The inquest was opened in Shrewsbury and adjourned until 2 July.
John Ellery, senior coroner for Shropshire, was told at the short hearing at The Shirehall, Mrs Adey's husband identified her body at the Charles Nicolle Hospital in Tunis, the day after the attack.
The couple were on a holiday cruise aboard the MSC Splendida, which had docked at the port in Tunis on the day of the shootings. Mrs Adey was one of 17 cruise ship tourists who were killed.
Coroner's officer Julie Hartridge said: "It is reported the museum came under fire from gunmen and she received fatal gunshot wounds."
Ms Hartridge said a post-mortem examination carried out in the UK by a Home Office pathologist, on 25 March, had established provisional cause of death as "consistent with gunshot wounds to the abdomen and pelvis".
Islamic State militants have said they were behind the attack, which also left the two gunmen dead.
On Sunday, the Tunisian government said another leading suspect implicated in the shootings had been killed near the Algerian border.
