Google has agreed to buy Frommer's travel guides from US publishing firm Wiley & Sons for an undisclosed sum.

Google said it would be "a great addition" to the restaurant guide business Zagat, which it bought last year for $151m (Â£96m).
The search giant will publish reviews online under the Frommer's brand. It has not said whether it will continue to produce printed books.
Its aim is to provide a review for "every relevant place in the world".
Wiley & Sons said it would put the money it made from the sale into the core areas of its business - scientific, medical and education titles.
The two hundred year-old publisher said in March that it wanted to sell a number of its assets, including the Frommer's travel guide business, CliffsNotes education guides and Webster's New World dictionaries.
News of the deal hit other firms which provide online reviews. Yelp was down almost 7%, while travel site Expedia lost almost 2%.
Earlier, Google announced that it was cutting 20% of the workforce at mobile phone maker Motorola, which it took over last year.
