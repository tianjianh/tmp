Terry Mitchell finishes Westminster Abbey to Hull walk

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A former soldier has finished a 180-mile (290km) walk from the tomb of the Unknown Warrior at Westminster Abbey to Hull.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Terry Mitchell, 54, who served 13 years in the Royal Corps of Transport, finished the trip by laying a wreath at the city's cenotaph.
Mr Mitchell, a PCSO with Humberside Police, said he had a "silly idea ever year" but this was his "swan-song".
The trek raised funds for Hull Veterans Support Centre and Hull for Heroes.
Mr Mitchell said he had "lived on tea and energy drinks" and it was his final walk because he was "never going to do it again."
He was met at the ceremony in Hull by Councillor Sean Chaytor, the Lord Mayor, standard bearers and members of his family.
On 11 November 1920, two years after World War One had ended, the body of an unknown warrior was taken in a procession through London to the Cenotaph and then to nearby Westminster Abbey where it was buried.
The idea of an unknown soldier buried in the abbey symbolises all those who made the ultimate sacrifice in conflicts.
