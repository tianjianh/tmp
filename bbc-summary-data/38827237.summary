Leyton Orient: Ulrich Nnomo loan to Paris cancelled over Fifa rules

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Leyton Orient winger Ulrich Nnomo has had his loan to Paris FC cancelled.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The League Two side agreed a deal with Paris yesterday but the move fell foul of Fifa Players' Transfer rules.
A player cannot feature for more than two clubs in a season and Nnomo has returned to Orient, who are 23rd in League Two.
The 20-year-old made seven appearances for the O's but also played a reserve game for French club Chateauroux before moving to Brisbane Road in the summer.
