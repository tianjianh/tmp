[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Scottish Labour leader Jim Murphy and comedian Eddie Izzard were heckled by opponents during general election campaigning in Glasgow.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
There were scuffles involving Labour party supporters and their opponents.
Mr Murphy was in the city centre trying to address party activists.
Protestors played loud music and shouted "Red Tories out". They drowned out the politician as he tried to speak to the crowd alongside Mr Izzard.
Mr Murphy said the protest was evidence that the SNP were trying to disrupt the democratic process.
However, demonstrators interviewed by the BBC denied they were there on behalf of the SNP.
Elsewhere on the Scottish campaign trail, Liberal Democrat leader Willie Rennie and Secretary of State for Scotland Alistair Carmichael have been visiting Stonehaven.
SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon is focussing on the NHS at Easterbrook Hall in Dumfries and Ruth Davidson of the Scottish Conservatives has been meeting voters in Ayr.
