Mr Amiridis, 59, went missing three days ago after travelling to Rio from Brasilia for the traditional New Year celebrations on Copacabana beach.
He was last seen on Monday in the city of Nova Iguacu on the outskirts of Rio, where the car was found.
Forensic experts are carrying out tests to establish the body's identity.
The ambassador's car was discovered under a flyover on one of the main access roads to Rio.
He had phoned his wife from a flat in Nova Iguacu on Monday saying he was about to go out. He has not been heard from since.
Police say it is unlikely that he was kidnapped, as no ransom has been sought.
Rio has a high crime rate and violent incidents are not unusual, especially in the busy season between Christmas and New Year, when hundreds of thousands of tourists travel to the city.
