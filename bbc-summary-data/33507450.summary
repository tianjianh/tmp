A group of performers from Nepal who survived the earthquakes in April took centre stage at a world music festival in Denbighshire at the weekend.

Five members of the Rising Culture Group from Bhaktapur, near Kathmandu, made the trek to the Llangollen International Musical Eisteddfod.
The trip had been in doubt following the disaster in April in which some members suffered personal tragedy.
Thirty group members had originally been expected to perform at Llangollen.
Eisteddfod musical director Eilir Owen Griffiths said: "The work which has gone on behind the scenes to see that this group gets to Llangollen has been phenomenal.
"We are honoured to have them because when someone's country has been devastated to the extent theirs has the last thing you'd expect them to do is travel across the world to perform. The fact that they have is quite magical."
