Corbyn: Labour will seek amendment to any Article 50 bill

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Labour will seek to amend any bill on the Article 50 process to withdraw from the EU, Jeremy Corbyn has reiterated.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Labour leader told Sky News the party will seek an amendment on "market access and protections", but the referendum result will be respected.
The government's appeal against a High Court ruling that ministers should refer to Parliament before triggering Article 50 will be heard on Monday.
Mr Corbyn is currently in Prague with other left-wing European politicians.
What if ministers lose the Brexit appeal?
The government is expected to lose its Supreme Court appeal against an earlier High Court ruling, which said ministers cannot start the process of the UK's exit from the EU without a parliamentary debate.
BBC News understands that a short three-line bill has been prepared by the government in the event of an Article 50 debate in Parliament, so that Prime Minister Theresa May can still meet her March deadline.
It is not the first time Mr Corbyn has discussed the need to negotiate before agreeing on any potential Article 50 bill.
In November, he told the Sunday Mirror that Labour would not vote in favour of the bill in parliament unless Theresa May agrees to their "Brexit bottom lines".
On Saturday, Mr Corbyn said: "When the Article 50 debate comes up we will put forward an amendment to it which will be on the issues I've just said on market access and protections.
"We want those to be part of the negotiation but we are respecting the result of the referendum. It might not be the one we wanted, it's the one we've got."
A spokesman for Mr Corbyn told the BBC Labour would propose the amendment to "try to force the government to bring their negotiating position to parliament".
However, the spokesman added that if the amendment failed, Labour "will not vote against the Article 50 bill".
The Labour leader's comments come as Attorney General Jeremy Wright accused the High Court of treating the referendum result as if it were "almost... a footnote" in a document setting out the government's Supreme Court appeal arguments.
Mr Corbyn also gave a speech at the Party of European Socialists in Prague, where he urged progressive parties across Europe to unite against the rise of the "populist right" and accused some "populist right" parties of being "political parasites".
