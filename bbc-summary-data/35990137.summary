The man was spotted on traffic cameras between junctions 11 and 14 on the clockwise carriageway.
Surrey Police said he was trying to reach the airport at about 06:00 BST on Thursday.
Highways England said the cyclist was "irresponsible and could have caused a serious incident".
At one point he is seen riding the wrong way along the busy motorway, before crossing the carriageway.
Surrey Police's road policing unit described in a tweet how traffic slowed as distracted motorists turned to look at the cyclist, who is believed to be from Feltham, West London.
Martin Crosswell, a manager at Highways England, said: "It is important all road users follow the Highway Code and listen to advice from traffic officers. The actions of this man were irresponsible and could have caused a serious incident."
