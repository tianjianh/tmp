The rock legends' set went out on the BBC World Service as part of Alexis Korner's Rhythm and Blues programme and was taped from an AM radio in Europe.
It includes the band's only known recording of the track Sunshine Woman.
The session recording has been restored with help from guitarist Jimmy Page for inclusion on a new compilation.
The Complete BBC Sessions, which will be released in September, is a remastered update of a 1997 collection of tracks recorded for the BBC between 1969 and 1971.
It includes eight previously unreleased recordings, including the first broadcast of Stairway To Heaven, from the BBC Paris Cinema in London on 1 April 1971.
Versions of songs from the band's first two albums also feature, including Communication Breakdown and What Is And What Should Never Be.
Formed in 1968, Led Zeppelin went on to become one of the world's biggest bands, with each of their studio albums making the top 10 of the US Billboard charts.
They officially split in 1980, following the death of drummer John Bonham. The remaining members reformed for a 2007 concert in London, with Bonham's son Jason playing drums.
