The Tiffin University graduate averaged over eight points and three assists per game for Wolves in his debut campaign in the BBL last term.
Khan is the first member of the squad to agree fresh terms at the University Arena for 2016-17.
He joins new recruits Danny Huffor, Marek Klassen, Trevor Setty, Deondre McWhorter and Jermel Kennedy at Wolves.
"Last year was his rookie year straight out of college, so it was very much a learning curve for him," head coach Paul James told BBC Hereford and Worcester.
"He had some games where he was outstanding and we're looking to improve him and make him one of the better guards in the league."
