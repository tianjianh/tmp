[SN]TITLE[SN]
Chester 2-0 Aldershot Town

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Chester stretched their unbeaten National League run to seven games as they eventually saw off Aldershot.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The two goals came either side of the break from Jordan Chapell and James Alabi, who had earlier missed a penalty.
Alabi, who scored four times in 8-2 home win in this same fixture last season, hit the left upright with his spot-kick after being crudely felled in the box.
But Chapell made amends on the stroke of half-time, firing in a low left-foot shot from a narrow angle, before Alabi struck his ninth goal of the season from close range on 53 minutes.
But City had to survive several scares, Shamir Fenelon hitting the left post from 20 yards, before Bernard Mensah hit the bar and home keeper Alex Lynch made a great save to tip over Scott Rendell's powerful shot.
