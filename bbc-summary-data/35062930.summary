The boys mother recently reported that his bicycle had been taken from the communal area in their apartments.
Adee, who has Aspergers Syndrome, is a keen cyclist and his bicycle was one of his most prized possessions.
After hearing about the incident, officers from Lisburn and Castlereagh, bought him a new bike.
On Wednesday evening, police asked Adee to come to Dundonald police station for a chat.
He arrived at the station with his mum and dad, and was asked by one of the officers to close his eyes.
The officer brought out the gift, which he then took on a test ride around the station.
According to PSNI Castlereagh's Facebook page, Adee is "a very happy boy again".
As the search for Adee's first bicycle continues, police are appealing for anyone with information to come forward.
