Robert Finlay, 48, from Wincanton, admitted causing David Hick's death by careless driving while drunk.
He was jailed at Bristol Crown Court along with his partner, Felicity Wheeler, 32, also Wincanton, who tried to cover up what happened.
Finlay's friend Joseph Breen was also jailed for his part in the cover-up.
Breen, 39, from London was jailed for three years after helping to scrap the car Finlay had been driving on the night of the collision in October 2014. Wheeler received 18 months for conspiracy to pervert the course of Justice.
Sentencing them at Bristol Crown Court, Judge James Patrick said he was sure they were all involved in trying to cover up what had happened.
Mr Hick, who had been out walking his dogs, was found with fatal head injuries on Cole Road in Bruton.
After the death of Mr Hick, Det Ch Insp Phil Jones had appealed to the driver saying "come and find us before we come and find you",
The court was told Finlay, who was also banned for driving from six years, had drunk seven pints with Breen prior to getting into the car.
