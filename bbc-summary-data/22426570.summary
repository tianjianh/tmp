[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Fifa's new anti-racism taskforce wants extra observers at games to specifically monitor racist or discriminatory behaviour.

The taskforce, meeting for the first time, has also proposed tougher penalties for clubs whose players, officials or fans are guilty of racism.
They include points deductions and elimination from competitions.
Ghana's AC Milan midfielder Kevin-Prince Boateng, who led his team from the field in protest at racism from supporters at a friendly game, is a taskforce member.
Member associations will vote on the measures at Fifa's annual congress in Mauritius at the end of May.
The new taskforce, formed by football's world governing body in a bid to combat discrimination in the game, is led by Jeffrey Webb, a Fifa vice-president from the Cayman Islands.
Penalties for racism would start with stronger fines or games played behind closed doors.
They would be followed by points deductions for offending teams or even elimination from competitions.
The proposals would apply only to Fifa-mandated competitions but sources close to the discussions have told the BBC they expect Fifa to encourage other confederations to adopt the same or similar measures.
European football's governing body Uefa already adopts a monitoring system in co-operation with Football Against Racism in Europe (Fare). It is expected that Fifa's proposal would be administered along similar lines.
A second taskforce meeting is planned for the autumn to look at plans for an education programme across football.
