Sheriff Mbye, 18, died in hospital from multiple stab wounds sustained in a "scuffle" which left another man with serious knife injuries, police said.
It happened on Bristol Road South in the Northfield area of the city at 17:00 BST on Friday.
An 18-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of murder and police officers are seeking "a small number of other men".
Officers called to the scene found a 19-year-old in a barber shop being looked after by customers.
While they were there, reports were received from the Queen Elizabeth hospital that Mr Mbye, from Lee Bank, had been dropped off in a white coloured Audi, which then drove away.
The car was later found by police abandoned in Hickman Gardens, Ladywood.
Part of Bristol Road South remains sealed off for forensic examination.
Det Insp Harry Harrison, from West Midlands Police, said: "My condolences go to the family of Sheriff who are heartbroken at losing their loved one.
"I would like to reassure them that many people who were in the area at the time responded admirably to the terrible situation which confronted them.
"Both victims were tended to, details of possible people or vehicles involved were relayed to police and vital clues were guarded."
Door-to-door inquiries continue and murder detectives will be examining CCTV footage.
