Hundreds of people have signed a petition asking ITV to withdraw an Emmerdale storyline about a helicopter crash following the Clutha disaster.

Kerry McGhee, whose father Samuel was one of ten people killed when a helicopter crashed into the Glasgow bar in November 2013, is among the signatories.
She said: "I find it disgusting that people want to use it as a storyline."
ITV said it always "considers carefully the content of its programming."
The episodes of the TV soap featuring the crash are due to be broadcast this week.
It is part of a series of storylines focussing on the wedding of characters Debbie Dingle and Pete Barton.
In a statement, an ITV spokesman added: "The helicopter crash circumstances are very different to any real life cases that we are aware of.
"The accident occurs as a consequence of Chrissie setting fire to her cheating husband's car which spreads to the scrapyard. Gas canisters are ignited and explode into the air striking the helicopter."
The petition, called "Show some respect to the Clutha Disaster victims and families by not running a storyline about a helicopter crash on Emmerdale" has been posted on the change.org website.
It is addressed to Emmerdale producer Kate Oates.
Ms McGhee wrote: "I'm signing because my father was killed in this accident and I find it disgusting that people want to use it as a storyline."
Morag Lennox, from Glasgow, who also signed the petition, said: "We the people of Glasgow are still coming to terms with the loss at the Clutha."
Sana Irving, another signatory, wrote: "Disrespectful and upsetting to the victims families."
The Clutha pub reopened last month in a ceremony which was attended by First Minister Nicola Sturgeon.
