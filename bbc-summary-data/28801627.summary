[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Up to 1,000 jobs are at risk as a West Yorkshire council tries to cut Â£60m from its budget, it has been claimed.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Labour-run Kirklees Council must save the money over three years, said its leader, Councillor David Sheard.
Mr Sheard told BBC Radio Leeds political reporter Louise Martin it could mean losing up to 1,000 jobs.
"Some things we have relied on for 100 years are no longer sacrosanct," he said, adding the council could have "no money left" by 2020 without cuts.
Budget restrictions could mean the closure of Batley and Birstall markets, museums and a reduction in street cleaning.
The council, which serves the area around Batley, Dewsbury, Huddersfield and Holmfirth, currently employs about 7,000 people, excluding teachers.
Mr Sheard said: "We're not the only authority in this position. The government's ideas are for smaller local authorities and people doing more for themselves."
Mr Sheard said if the council did not do "something about our budgets" it would have "no money left" by 2020.
The council currently has a budget of about Â£305m from government grants, external income and business rates.
