Gloucester have named Scotland skipper Greig Laidlaw as their new club captain for the forthcoming Premiership season.

The 30-year-old scrum-half, capped 53 times by his national side, replaces England centre Billy Twelvetrees.
Laidlaw has made 42 appearances for the Cherry and Whites since his arrival in the summer of 2014.
"It's a privilege and honour to follow in the footsteps of so many great players at Gloucester, a club with so much heritage and history," he said.
"Billy did a terrific job as captain and I'm delighted that he's still around, because having so many experienced senior pros in the squad makes the role a lot easier."
