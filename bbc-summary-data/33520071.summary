The RUH Bath NHS Foundation Trust said the public car park is part of a wider plan to develop the hospital site.
It includes a cancer treatment centre, therapy building, new pharmacy and a sterile area where staff will prepare medication and equipment.
The plan also features new gardens and patio areas for patients to enjoy while they are recovering in hospital.
The developments are being made available to the public at an exhibition in the Oasis Conference Centre at the hospital.
