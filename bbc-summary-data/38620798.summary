[SN]TITLE[SN]
Chester 1-1 Wrexham

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Chester came from behind to claim a point against Wrexham as the cross-border derby ended in a draw for the second time this season.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
John Rooney put Wrexham ahead against his old club on 55 minutes when he flicked in a near-post right-wing cross from fellow former Chester player Anthony Barry.
But City were level just six minutes later when James Jennings brought down James Alabi, who sent keeper Chris Dunn the wrong way from the penalty spot.
Chester were reduced to 10 men for the final 11 minutes when captain Luke George was sent off for a second bookable offence in quick succession.
Wrexham came close to winning it in their best spell as Jordan White and the third of the visitors' three Chester old boys Paul Rutherford just shot wide.
Earlier, Chester had been dominant, as Ryan Astles twice went close with headers, while Alabi had the ball in net from Wrexham old boy Elliott Durrell's left-wing cross, only for it to be ruled out for offside. And Dunn had to go full length to his left to save on-loan Walsall full-back Kyle Vassell's fierce, low shot.
But, in a cracking Bumpers Lane derby, in front of comfortably the hosts' best crowd of the season, 3,961, a draw was the fairest result as Chester maintained their record of not having lost at home to Wrexham since being reformed in 2010.
