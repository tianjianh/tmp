Labour's former culture secretary Tessa Jowell has announced she will run for the next mayor of London.

Ms Jowell said she would focus on providing affordable housing, transport and "opening up opportunities" for everyone in the city.
She said she would build on public sector land for the "first time since 1986" and create 2,000 homes per year, in the next 20 years.
Transport for London's (TfL) land could also  be used for the homes, she said.
The former Labour MP, who stood down at this year's general election, said she wanted "a London where everyone shares in our city's success - young and old; low and middle income as well as the better off".
Tessa Jowell's career
The city under her stewardship would also be "intolerant of poverty, of injustice, of hopelessness", she said.
She said she wanted to set up the housing equivalent of TfL, led by a commissioner to "get London building again".
Ms Jowell said; "It's not enough for the mayor to exhort others to build homes.  We've tried that - it hasn't worked.
"The next mayor needs to take the lead, building thousands of homes Londoners can afford, on the vast swathes of land that the mayor owns."
She added: "I've got a plan. Not just the same old empty boasts we always hear at election time - people are switching off and who can blame them?
"And I'll tell you this - I will deliver. I will see it through, that's what I've always done."
Ms Jowell joins fellow Labour candidates Hackney MP Diane Abbott and MP for Tottenham David Lammy, who said they would both stand for the May 2016 mayoral election.
Author and Journalist Christian Wolmar has said he too will join the race to succeed Tory Boris Johnson.
At Ms Jowell's announcement on Tuesday in Brixton, former transport secretary Lord Adonis described her as "inspirational" and ex-treasury minister Kitty Ussher said Ms Jowell would be "a fantastic mayor and exactly what London needs".
Her successor as MP for Dulwich and West Norwood, Helen Hayes, said: "She has an ability like very few politicians to relate and connect to people from all sorts of different backgrounds across the whole community in London."
