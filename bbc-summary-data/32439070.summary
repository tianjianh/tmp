Belfast is in the top 20 locations in the UK for reporting problems with mice, according to the British Pest Control Association (BPCA).

Belfast City Council dealt with 1,424 mice issues within an 12-month period, the latest available figures show.
That equates to 5.3 mice reports for every 1,000 residents in the city.
BPCA's research, which compared figures for 407 local authorities across the UK, found Belfast had the 20th highest instance of mice problems, per head.
The association obtained the figures, which cover the financial year from April 2013 to March 2014, through the Freedom of Information Act.
The data also shows Belfast City Council tackled 1,940 problems with rats, 682 with wasps and 115 with bedbugs during the year.
BPCA's chief executive, Simon Forrester, said: "Our study provides a comprehensive and graphic indication of the demand placed on local authorities for pest control.
"There are many localised reasons why a particular area could have a high prevalence of a certain pest, but we're concerned that services are being cut across the country."
Mr Forrester added: "The government's austerity measures have left local authorities under immense pressure to come up with savings."
A spokeswoman for Belfast City Council said it was "one of the last few local authorities in the UK still providing a free pest control service to its domestic ratepayers".
"It is well used by the people of Belfast, as these figures show," she added.
