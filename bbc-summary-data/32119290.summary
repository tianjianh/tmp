"Blind Dave", from West Bromwich, is hoping to compete the challenge with his team in six days.
He has already completed several gruelling challenges in the past few years - seven marathons in seven days on seven continents, 10 marathons in 10 days travelling from John O'Groats to Land's End, and cycling between each stage.
He hopes to raise Â£30,000 through his latest challenge for the Albion Foundation, which encourages blind and disabled people to play football.
BBC Midlands Today's Sarah Falkland went to watch him train.
