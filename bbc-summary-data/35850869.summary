The American, 34, reached her 88th career final by beating Poland's Agnieszka Radwanska 6-4 7-6 (7-1).
It took 2012 champion Azarenka just over two hours to see off Karolina Pliskova, with the 26-year-old Belarusian winning 7-6 1-6 6-2.
"This year has been great. It feels so great to be supported," said Williams, twice a winner of the tournament.
"It's been a great comeback here in Indian Wells. I'm excited about that."
Williams won seven games in a row to take the first set and go 3-0 up in the second, before seven successive points clinched victory in the tie-break.
She has won 23 of her 24 matches at Indian Wells, taking a self-imposed 14-year exile from the event amidst allegations of racial abuse from fans after sister Venus withdrew minutes before their semi-final in 2001.
"I had a lot of support, I heard a lot of 'go Serenas' and that was kind of cool," added Williams, who won the tournament in 1999 and 2001.
