It had looked to be plain-sailing for Posh as they took an early two-goal lead through goals from Leo Da Silva Lopes and Gwion Edwards.
But Adam Campbell pulled a goal back for League Two County, who sit a division below Posh, before Lee Angol saw red for the visitors just before the break.
The drama began after just three minutes as Da Silva Lopes, who turned 18 in the week, found the corner of the net from 25 yards.
It was 2-0 after 15 minutes when Edwards scored from Paul Taylor's cross, but Campbell's 20-yard effort halved the deficit three minutes before half-time.
The momentum of the game shifted once again, however, as Angol saw red after putting his arm into Matt Tootle's face.
The Magpies had several second-half chances, but the decisive moment fell to Laing, who fired home after the ball dropped invitingly from a corner to earn a replay.
