At least 14 migrants were killed when they were hit by a train on a well-trodden route across Macedonia to Western Europe, according to police.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The accident happened at a remote location near the central Macedonian city of Veles on Thursday night.
Local media said migrants often used the rail track as a guide while heading north after landing in Greece.
EU leaders have agreed plans to curb an influx of migrants as many cross the Mediterranean aboard overcrowded boats.
They held a summit in Brussels on Thursday after more than 750 people died on a boat crossing to Italy from Libya on Sunday.
Reports say the migrants killed in Macedonia were part of a group of about 50 people, mainly from Somalia and Afghanistan.
People fleeing war, poverty and repression in the Middle East and Africa are increasingly turning to the Balkans as a land route to western Europe, deemed safer than crossing from Libya to Italy by boat.
Many instead cross from Turkey to Greece.
The train was said to be travelling to the Serbian capital Belgrade.
Rescue efforts were hampered by difficult terrain, with the site of the accident accessible only by foot or railway.
