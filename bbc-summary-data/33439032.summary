Kirkbride, who played Deirdre for more than 40 years died in January aged 60.
The actress had been away from the screen for four months following her diagnosis with cancer.
In Wednesday night's episode, her on-screen husband Ken, played by Bill Roache is told of the devastating news by her friend Bev.
Her death will also be announced to the rest of Weatherfield's residents at a party planned for her homecoming at the Rovers Return.
A funeral service for her character will be shown on Monday night.
Kirkbride began  in Coronation Street in 1972 as Deirdre Hunt.
In the 1980s, one of the soap's most famous storylines hinged on whether she would stay with Ken Barlow. She was married four times in the programme, twice to Ken.
The actress had previously taken a break from the show after being diagnosed with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in 1993.
Following her death, Roache said Coronation Street had lost one of its "iconic characters".
"I feel Anne's loss so personally having worked closely with her for over 40 years. You always knew she was there because her laugh was never far away."
