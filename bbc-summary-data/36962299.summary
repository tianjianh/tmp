Ross McCormack: Aston Villa have £12m bid for Fulham striker accepted

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Aston Villa have had a £12m bid accepted for Fulham striker Ross McCormack.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Scotland international had previously been linked with Norwich City but they have now been outbid by their Championship rivals.
McCormack, 29, joined the Whites in 2014 from Leeds United for a fee believed to be worth £11m.
He has scored 38 league goals in 89 appearances for Fulham, who finished 20th in the Championship last season.
Glasgow-born McCormack, who made his debut with Rangers in May 2004, has a career record of 152 goals in 439 appearances.
If McCormack completes his move to the Midlands, he would become relegated Villa's fourth summer signing.
Since he took charge on 2 June, manager Roberto Di Matteo has added goalkeeper Pierluigi Gollini from Italian side Hellas Verona, as well as signing Bournemouth defender Tommy Elphick and Reading midfielder Aaron Tshibola.
Villa start life back in the second tier of English football with a trip to Sheffield Wednesday on Sunday, 7 August (16:30 BST).
