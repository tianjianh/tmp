The 21-year-old won the club's player of the year award in 2016 after joining from York City Knights.
Minikin has scored six tries in 16 appearances and will remain at Wheldon Road until the end of the 2019 season.
"We have a bright future here at Castleford and we're aiming to win some silverware, if not next year then in the near future," he said.
