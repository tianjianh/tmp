Shotton steelworks operates a steel galvanising line which colours steel and makes steel panels for buildings.
Community union official Keith Jordan said the works, which employs 800, was making money, unlike the Port Talbot plant which is said to lose Â£1m a day.
He said staff were stunned that Indian owner Tata Steel planned to sell its entire loss-making UK business.
"Shotton is one of if not the only site in Tata Steel UK that is profitable," said Mr Jordan.
"The prime minister needs to take some positive steps to help Tata keep us viable.
"We have two businesses based at Shotton and both of them are profitable," he said.
The company has said it would "explore all options", including "divestment" of its operations.
The Shotton site has had mixed fortunes over its long history with 6,500 made redundant in March 1980.
In 1967, 12,000 were employed at the works when the industry was nationalised.
