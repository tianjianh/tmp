[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Walter Zenga's Wolves made it three games unbeaten this season as they comfortably beat Reading at Molineux.

The hosts almost took an early lead when Joao Teixeira teed up Joe Mason but he was denied by the hands of goalkeeper Ali Al Habsi.
Matt Doherty put the hosts ahead before the break when he hammered a fierce shot in from 12 yards.
Mason headed home from a George Saville corner to double Wolves' lead as Reading failed to make an impact.
After joining Wolves from Cardiff City in January, Mason's second goal in his last five games built on a promising end to last season.
Wolves, who beat Crawley 2-1 in the first round of the EFL Cup in midweek, move up to fifth in the table, on four points, following their opening-day 2-2 draw at Rotherham.
Jaap Stam's Reading, who slip seven places to 15th, struggled to counter Wolves' attacking threat, recording just one shot on target.
Wolves have now won two matches on the trot against Reading on the back of a seven-game winless run against the Royals prior to that.
Wolves head coach Walter Zenga:
"The team played very well. If we could have scored more goals it would have been nice. But I have a very nice group of players who want to work and push their limits.
"These are the most important things. As I said before, the spirit of the team is amazing. Sometimes I win and sometimes I learn but the passion, pride and spirit of the team must be the first three things.
"That is what we have to bring onto the pitch every time. The atmosphere was amazing as well. I have no words to describe that. My ambition remains to see the stadium full."
Reading manager Jaap Stam:
"In these games you need to be very sharp and focused. Wolves were really up for it at the beginning of the game and they did really well.
"The system that we want to play, you need to be patient on the ball and spread the play and let them run. But, if we lose the ball, it can be very difficult and that is what we did at times.
"If you are focused and concentrated then you can get results against these teams. We want to do a lot better but, if you look at the team, we played a lot of players who were not in the shape that they were in the last couple of weeks."
