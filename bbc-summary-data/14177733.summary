[SN]TITLE[SN]
Middlesbrough's mima to explore sharing art works

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Collections owned by a Teesside arts centre could be shown at other venues after it was awarded a Â£68,912 grant.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Middlesbrough's mima will receive the money from the Esmee Fairbairn Collections Fund.
It will allow it to explore the possibility of lending its collections to other museums and non-museum venues, such as schools, shopping centres or town halls, for a fee.
Under the scheme, mima will recruit a registrar and conservator.
Mima curator James Beighton said: "We hope that this will become a case study that can be used by other museums to justify appointments to these positions in the future."
