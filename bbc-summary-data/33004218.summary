The first giant sculptures of Shaun the Sheep, designed by celebrities, are being revealed ahead of a free public art trail in Bristol next month.

The latest two statues are by Peter Firmin, who co-created the children's TV character Bagpuss in the 1970s, and fashion designer Wayne Hemingway.
Bagpuss Shaun will be on display at Cabot Circus and Mr Hemingway's Sheepish at Temple Church Gardens.
The trail, featuring 70 statues, starts on 6 July and ends on 31 August.
It is the first time Peter Firmin and his daughter Emily, an artist and sculptor, have worked together. Ms Firmin also played the part of "Emily" - the daughter of Bagpuss's owner - in the 1970s children's TV series, when she was eight years old.
Mr Firmin said: "Emily helped me work out how to paint such a large sculpture, and helped paint the legs, as I found it difficult at my age to bend down to reach them."
Hemingway, who created fashion label Red or Dead, said designing the sculpture had been a "blast".
The statues will be auctioned later this year to raise funds for Bristol Children's Hospital's Grand Appeal.
A previous trail in Bristol in 2013, based on another Aardman character, Gromit, raised Â£4.5m for sick children after the sculptures were auctioned.
