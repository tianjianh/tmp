The Kent club face Leicester Riders in Sunday's showpiece, where they could start teenagers Gabriele Nikitinaite, 18, and Daniela Lozzi, 17.
"We've got a mix of older players and a number of very young players," Busch told BBC Radio Kent.
"For the club, it's a big opportunity. We're very excited to be there."
American Busch has already masterminded two victories over Leicester this season and believes youngsters Nikitinaite and Lozzi could be the key in Glasgow.
"From Christmas, their play has picked up big time for us and it's made things easier on our professionals, who are able to do more because everybody is contributing," he said.
"Leicester are certainly a very professional women's team but we've had some success against them and I'm sure it will be a really competitive game."
Leicester sit third in the WBBL Championship, two places ahead of the Suns, and will be hoping to do the double in Glasgow, with the men's final against Plymouth Raiders following the women's encounter.
Riders head coach Matt Harber told BBC Sport: "This is a fantastic opportunity.
"We have worked really hard for the past couple of years to position ourselves and we think we are ready to make that next step and bring back some silverware to Leicester."
Riders guard Alex Smith added: "Matt really emphasises staying upbeat and positive, building a team good camaraderie and being competitive every day.
"When you are winning it is always easier to stay upbeat and keep everyone on the same page and stay focused.
"Basketball in the UK has a great atmosphere and I think we are definitely on the verge of something - specifically in Leicester with the new sports hall."
