Salford winger Justin Carney and centre Junior S'au were pictured in heated exchanges with supporters as they tried to make sure their children were safe.
Club owner Marwan Koukash has promised to act against the fans involved.
"There is no place in rugby league for them," he said.
Salford head coach Ian Watson confirmed that the players had gone into the stands to get their children.
He said Carney's children - and those of team conditioner Greg Brown - were "a little bit shaken" by the incident, adding: "They're all OK, but they shouldn't be scenes you see at rugby.

"It should be a good game and family sport to come to. People that are causing problems and fighting don't deserve to be involved."
BBC Radio Manchester's Trevor Hunt, who was at the Super League game, said a flare was thrown from the Salford end and a supporter escorted out, moments before the trouble began.
Rugby Football League chief executive Nigel Wood said: "We will conduct a full investigation into the events that took place in the away section of the crowd at the game between Huddersfield and Salford.
"We do not condone violence of any kind and will ensure that anyone found to have acted improperly is dealt with accordingly."
