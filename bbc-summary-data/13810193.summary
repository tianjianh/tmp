The Owain Glyndwr Centre in Machynlleth, Powys, tells the story of the Welsh uprising from 1400, and first opened in 1981.
A new exhibition about the 15th Century rebel prince is also being unveiled.
Funding has come from the historic monuments agency Cadw.
The centre, inside the Grade I-listed Parliament House, will be opened by Alun Davies, AM for Mid and West Wales and the Welsh Government's deputy minister for agriculture and European programmes.
Parliament House was built in about 1460 and is understood to stand on the site of Glyndwr's parliament.
The rebel leader was crowned as Prince of Wales at Machynlleth in 1404, and is regarded by many as one of the great heroes of Welsh history.
On its website, the centre said "an exciting, new exhibition" was being launched at the newly renovated venue.
It added: "This innovative and up-to-date exhibition, a complete redesign and updating of the previous exhibition, provides a colourful, informative - and sometimes intriguing - glimpse into the life and times of Owain Glyndwr, gentleman and soldier, lawyer turned rebel, national hero and self-proclaimed Prince of Wales."
The exhibition includes a video telling the story of Glyndwr's Parliament of 1404, a replica broadsword, replica period costumes and banners.
Money has paid for new a heating and lighting system, and for the restoration of a mural of Glyndwr leading his warriors into battle.
A lime plaster ceiling has also been refurbished.
