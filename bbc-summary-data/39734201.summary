It is a first crack at a world belt for the 24-year-old, whose 100% record in 16 pro contests has earned him British and WBC International titles.
Haskins, 33, from Bristol, has twice successfully defended the title he won by beating Ryosuke Iwasa in 2015.
"I always dreamed of headlining in Belfast. I'm so excited," said Burnett.
"Lee Haskins has been in the game a long time so he has probably been in this situation before. But the Belfast crowd are very passionate for their fighter and will be making plenty of noise for me.
"I'm still new to this level, but this is definitely the right fight for me at this stage of my career. I know I'm capable of stepping up."
Haskins has won 34 and lost three bouts since turning professional in 2003.
Burnett's last fight was an eight-round points victory over Joseafat Reyes of Mexico in Hull in February.
