[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Nicole Kidman is facing anger from flight attendants over her role as the face of Etihad Airways due to its alleged treatment of female employees, something it denies.

The actress, who has served as the UN Goodwill Ambassador since 2006, appears in an ad campaign for the airline.
The company launched the campaign with Nicole Kidman onboard its new Airbus.
The Association of Professional Flight Attendants released a statement urging her to step down.
In an open letter to the Oscar-winning actress, Laura Glading, the president of the union, which represents 25,000 American flight attendants, claimed the sponsorship deal was at odds with her role as a UN Women's Goodwill Ambassador.
The statement, released to the Hollywood Reporter, said: "We urge you, on behalf of the women and girls that you spoke of so eloquently [on International Women's Day], not to play a part in promoting Etihad Airways, a company that imposes abusive labour practices on its female employees and whose sole owner is a government that stands against the very world that you imagine.
"Later that very same week, we saw that you had begun appearing in a new campaign for Etihad, a company that the Wall Street Journal has publicly reported 'may fire women if they become pregnant' and forces flight attendants to live in 'confinement' in secure compounds'.
"These are the types of conditions that APFA fought to eradicate decades ago in the United States."
The airline responded saying: "Our commitment to the welfare, safety, and well-being of the diverse group of men and women who have worked so hard to make Etihad Airways great is one of our airline's top priorities."
Specifically addressing the claims about pregnancy, Etihad said it "fully supports its cabin crew during and after their pregnancy".
The statement went on: "When a cabin crew member informs Etihad of a pregnancy, she is provided with appropriate ground duties for the duration of their pregnancy. During this time, she remains fully compensated and fully engaged on the ground."
