Growing cannabis 'more profitable', chicken farmer tells court

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A farmer has admitted growing cannabis plants worth Â£109,000 because "they made more money" than rearing chickens.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Edward James, 68, was found with hundreds of plants on his land at Bratton Fleming, Barnstaple, Devon.
He told police growing the Class B drug was "more profitable than chickens", Exeter Crown Court heard.
Recorder Mr Rufus Taylor adjourned the case until 30 July, and ordered pre-sentence reports be prepared by the Probation Service.
Sean Brunton, prosecuting, said in light of James' guilty plea to producing cannabis, his not guilty plea to a second charge of possession with intent to supply had been accepted.
Gareth Evans, defending, said James is in poor health and has strong personal mitigation.
