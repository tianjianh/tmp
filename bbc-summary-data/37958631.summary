The visitors failed to clear a corner and substitute Adams turned in from close range to earn a first win in four league games for Gary Rowett's Blues.
Earlier, home striker Clayton Donaldson had hit the post with a low shot and Bristol City's Lee Tomlin sent a free-kick against the crossbar.
Blues' Jonathan Spector was sent off for a tackle on Tomlin late on.
The visitors had been much improved after the interval but their defeat at St Andrew's stretched their winless league run to three games.
Donaldson scored a hat-trick in last season's corresponding fixture but his effort against the upright was the closest he came to ending a personal goal drought which stretches back to 17 September.
Adams, who joined Blues from Sheffield United in August, was on a similar scoreless run but popped up to score his third goal for the club with nine minutes remaining.
Birmingham City manager Gary Rowett: "We navigated the difficult periods and finished winning the game.
"Sometimes you can win without playing well in the Championship. You saw Burnley do it last season where you are resolute, keep clean sheets, nick games and don't play well. That is a skill in itself.
"This season we have been much better playing at home. The clean sheet was important and I'm delighted with our home form which includes wins over Norwich City, Sheffield Wednesday and now Bristol City."
Bristol City manager Lee Johnson: "I'm disappointed to come away from the game without any points.
"The games at Championship level are always on a fine balance. I was disappointed with the goal and the mistakes which led up to that goal,
"I cannot be too critical of my side because I thought we were fantastic in the second half. Away from home we took the game to a good side and peppered the final third with runners and quality. It was just that finish and beating the man of the match, Tomasz Kuszczak."
