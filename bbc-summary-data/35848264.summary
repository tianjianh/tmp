World Twenty20 2016: Great win shows England the way - Agnew

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
In reaching 230 to beat South Africa at the World Twenty20 in Mumbai, England pulled off their greatest run chase in this form of the game.

At the halfway stage you wouldn't have given Eoin Morgan's side much hope and I certainly did not think they would win.
However, to chase that target in the pressurised situation of knowing they would probably go out if they lost is a great victory for England - and one that shows the other sides in this tournament that they should be feared.
It some ways, England were helped by the size of the task in front of them. They had no choice but to play with abandon.
Jason Roy really got them going with four boundaries in the first over. By the time he was out for a 16-ball 43, England were on the way to 79 runs from the first five overs. The back of the chase had been broken, allowing the rest to play relatively normally.
From there, Joe Root produced a beautifully measured innings, one befitting his extraordinary talent in all three forms of the game. He played the big shots, but also mixed them with the dinky, clever, innovative little touches that really make him an outstanding player.
Root was out with 11 still needed from 10 balls, which led to the gripping last over in which Chris Jordan and David Willey were out, before Moeen Ali got England over the line.

Now the question for England is can they set targets batting in the same way? They've seen that they have the potential to play in such a fearless style, but can they do it when the onus is on them to set the score?
If they are to go further in this tournament, they will have to show the ability to make huge totals without being cattle-prodded into it.
That, though, is smaller concern compared with the bowling, which disappointingly showed the same weaknesses as in the opening defeat by West Indies. If the ball doesn't swing for Willey and Reece Topley, there is no plan B because they haven't got the pace. They simply have to put the ball in the same spot again, which is entirely predictable for the batsmen.
Because of that, and the number of loose balls thrown in, South Africa got away to a flying start, from which England almost did not recover.
There are undoubtedly issues with the attack and it will be interesting to see how they are addressed for the next game against Afghanistan on Wednesday.
For that match, they move away from Mumbai, where the pitches have been brilliant for batting, to Delhi, where the conditions are currently unknown. Do England go for more pace in the shape of Liam Plunkett, or do they continue to hope the ball swings?
If it looks like the pitch will turn, will they be as bold as New Zealand were in their win over India and pick three spinners, bringing Liam Dawson into the side?
I hope they look carefully at their options and don't stubbornly stick to a plan that is not currently working, because teams have the measure of them at the moment.
That decision, though, is for another day. For now, England can revel in a remarkable victory.
