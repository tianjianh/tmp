The driver stopped at Clacket Lane services on the M25 in Surrey when he heard loud banging coming from inside the vehicle about 10:20 BST.
Police said several teenagers were among those found, who were then detained on suspicion of illegal entry.
South East Coast Ambulance said three people were taken to hospital.
"We sent a number of resources and, after assessing the group, took one woman and two men with minor ailments to East Surrey Hospital," said a spokeswoman.
Two calls were made to 999 about the lorry; one from the driver and one from a person inside the lorry, who initially claimed there were 40 people trapped in freezing temperatures and one of them was dead.
Sussex and Surrey road policing unit said the youngest of the stowaways was a 13-year-old boy. Others were aged between 15 and 17.
One of the occupants was suffering a fit, an elderly man had high blood pressure and others were suffering from hypothermia, police said.
Those on board were found to be Iraqi, Iranian, Syrian and Kurdish.
Police believe the migrants boarded the lorry in Holland in the early hours and the vehicle travelled to the UK through the Channel Tunnel.
The slip road to the petrol station on the clockwise carriageway was closed while police unloaded the lorry to make sure there were not more casualties.
A Surrey Police spokeswoman said the lorry driver was assisting with enquiries.
"The investigation will be passed to UK Visas and Immigration in due course," she said.
