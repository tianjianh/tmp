Manchester girl, 16, bailed after terror charges

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A 16-year-old girl accused of possessing a guide to making bombs has been released on bail after appearing in court accused of terror offences.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The teenager, from Manchester, was allegedly found with a copy of a document known as the Anarchist Cookbook.
She appeared at Manchester Youth Court accused of two offences under the Terrorism Act 2000.
She was granted bail but was told she must observe a curfew.
The girl must also report to police three times each week and is forbidden from applying for a passport.
In addition, she must remain in England or Wales.
It is alleged that, on or before 3 April, the girl was in possession of information of a kind likely to be of use to a person preparing or committing an act of terrorism.
As well as the Anarchist Cookbook, she was alleged to have possessed a second document, described as "a recipe for explosives".
Wearing a green parka jacket and headscarf, she sat before the district judge flanked by her mother and an uncle.
No pleas were entered, and she was released until a further hearing planned for 26 August.
