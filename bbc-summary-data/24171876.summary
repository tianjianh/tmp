The man, from Havant in Hampshire, was killed by an elephant he had been trying to photograph while on a jungle tour in the southern state of Tamil Nadu, police officers told the BBC.
The Foreign Office named him as Colin Manvell and said it was providing consular assistance to his family.
Police said he and two guides had illegally entered a sectioned-off area, reported the BBC's Natalia Antelava.
Officers said the lone animal had charged the men and hit the British man on the head with its trunk. The guides - who managed to escape the elephant - would be arrested, the police added.
Our Delhi correspondent said the area - which lies on the border between the southern states of Kerala and Tamil Nadu - is popular among tourists and home to large wildlife reserves.
Such incidents are rare, but resorts operating in the area are often criticised for disturbing animals and driving tourists to parts of the jungle that are not designated for safari tours, she said.
Meanwhile, the Times of India reported that police had not yet inspected the area of the Masinagudi National Park where the man, who is thought to have been 67 years old, was killed.
He is believed to have arrived in India from London.
He was treated at the local Masinagudi Hospital before being moved to Gudalur Government Hospital, where doctors pronounced him dead, the Times said.
Mr Manvell, a retired geography teacher at Warblington School in Havant, also worked at the town's Avenue Tennis and Squash Club.
Paula Fuge, of Portsmouth Tennis Academy, who knew Mr Manvell, said: "He was a lovely guy.
"He has always been a part of the tennis scene, he's really nice, he was always there for the kids.
"I didn't believe it when I heard what had happened, you never expect that to happen."
Headteacher Julia Vincent said: "Mr Manvell retired from head of geography at Warblington School a number of years ago. Although I did not know him personally, he was well-known to the school community and has kindly donated a trophy for academic achievement in geography.
"We were saddened to hear of this tragic accident and our thoughts and prayers go out to his friends and family at this sad time."
