One of them was wearing an Islamic State (IS) T-shirt, Marseilles prosecutor Brice Robin told Reuters.
Police said the teacher's life was not in danger. A hunt is under way for the attackers.
It comes as France is in a state of emergency after attacks in Paris on Friday killed 129 people.
IS has said it was behind the Paris attacks.
Police said the attack on the teacher, who is Jewish, happened at about 20:00 local time (19:00 GMT).
Mr Robin said three people on two scooters had approached the history teacher in a street and then "insulted, threatened and stabbed their victim in the arm and leg".
"They were interrupted by the arrival of a car and fled," he said.
One of the men showed a picture on his mobile telephone of the Islamist militant Mohamed Merah, Mr Robin added.
Merah killed seven people in attacks in south-western France in 2012, before being shot dead by police. His victims included three children and a teacher at a Jewish school.
