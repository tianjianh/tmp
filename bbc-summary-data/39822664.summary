Appeal over theft of 50 young sheep in Alves

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
More than 50 young sheep have been stolen from a farm in the Alves area of Moray.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The one-year-old livestock - a mixture of Cheviot and black face sheep - were taken from the Coltfield area between Wednesday and Thursday.
Police Scotland said the theft of such a large number of sheep would have required "careful planning" and the use of vehicles to transport the animals away from the area.
Officers appealed for information.
