Water firms call for wipes label change

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Water firms have called for an end to moistened wipes being labelled as flushable.

Scottish Water said it spent about £6m a year unblocking pipes, with disposable wipes and cotton buds some of the biggest culprits.
Industry body Water UK has urged trading standards authorities to end the use of labels that suggest wipes can be flushed down toilets.
It wants manufacturers to add prominent "do not flush" warnings to products.
Scottish Water has joined nearly 250 companies in 18 countries in signing a joint statement on the flushability of moistened wipes, calling for consumers to be given clear and unambiguous information about appropriate disposal methods.
Water UK has written a letter to the Chartered Trading Standards Institute (CTSI) urging it to investigate the issue of labelling.
Peter Farrer, Scottish Water's chief operating officer, said: "The reality is that wet wipes can cause flooding misery for householders and real damage to Scotland's environment.
"On average, Scottish Water responds to 80 blockages each day which are a direct result of inappropriate items like wet wipes being flushed down toilets.
"Together with items such as cotton buds, nappies and oil or grease from cooking products, these combine to create a blockage of material that doesn't break down easily.
"This can lead to flooding of homes, gardens and businesses, as well as pollution of beaches or rivers. And it's also costly for a business which aims to keep customer charges as low as possible - we spend around £6m a year tackling this problem."
EDANA, an industry group that represents the wet wipe manufacturers, said it accepted that 90% of such wipes should be disposed of in bins but argued that "do no flush" advice would penalise some products that were flushable.
In a statement it said: "Denying people a flushable product altogether will only make the problem worse, as flushable products will be replaced with those not designed to be flushed.
"Rather, EDANA believes that education is essential to helping the consumer know how and where to best dispose of their wipes
"Flushable wipes have to pass a rigorous set of tests developed by experts who have the extensive research and development knowledge, resources, and technical expertise to address the issue, so we're confident that when we call a wipe flushable, that it is indeed flushable."
