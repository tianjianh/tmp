Lee Clark has resigned as Blackpool manager following their relegation to League One.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 42-year-old was appointed on 30 October with the club bottom of the Championship table, where they stayed for the rest of the season.
The ex-Newcastle midfielder won three of the 33 games during his tenure.
In a statement, the club wished Clark well for the future and said they are in the process of compiling a shortlist as they search for a replacement.
The Seasiders' relegation was confirmed on 6 April and their last game of the season was abandoned following a pitch invasion by disgruntled fans.
Clark said: "After a great deal of thought I have come to the decision that it is not in the best interests of either myself or Blackpool that I continue as manager.
"I have therefore tendered my resignation to the chairman, which he has accepted."
Blackpool have had a miserable season, collecting just 25 points from their 45 games before their final match of the campaign.
They had only eight professionals under contract two weeks before their first game of the campaign, and sacked manager Jose Riga after just four months in charge.
Clark replaced the Belgian, but the former Birmingham and Huddersfield boss could not lift them off the bottom of the league.
Off the pitch, supporters engaged in several protests about the way the club is run by the Oyston family.
They culminated in a 2,000-strong demonstration outside Bloomfield Road, followed by a pitch invasion, at the final game of the season against Huddersfield.
