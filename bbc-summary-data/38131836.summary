The 44-year-old former Australia all-rounder, who joined Gloucestershire as a player in 1999, has been on their coaching staff since 2015.
"It certainly wasn't a hard decision to stay," the 2003 World Cup winner said.
Chief executive Will Brown added: "Having Ian extend his coaching contract is fantastic news for everyone associated with Gloucestershire."
