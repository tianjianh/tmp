[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The blaze at Howgate Street on Monday 7 November took more than 30 firefighters to bring under control.
Det Sgt Hugh McCombe said the incident was being treated as an "act of wilful fire-raising".
He said they were keen to speak to anyone who may have seen a lime green Vauxhaull Corsa stolen from the garage.
"This fire has caused a great deal of disruption to business owners and local residents," he said.
"This is a live criminal inquiry.
"Whatever information, no matter how insignificant you might feel it is, please contact the police."
