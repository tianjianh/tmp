[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A 32-year-old man has appeared in court in Dublin charged with the murder of Patricia O'Connor.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Ms O'Connor, who was 61, and from Rathfarnham in south Dublin, was reported missing on 2 June.
Her remains were found in several locations in the Wicklow Mountains, south of Dublin, over the past week.
A Garda (Irish police) detective told the court that Kieran Green, 32, with an address in Mountain View Park in Rathfarnham, was arrested on Thursday.
The detective told the court that when he was charged with the murder, Mr Green said "it was self defence".
The judge said due to the seriousness of the charge there was no question of bail and remanded Mr Green in custody.
She asked about legal aid and the accused's solicitor said his client is on social welfare and has an adult and four children as dependants.
He said his only request for his client was that he would receive a medical assessment in custody and be given any medical assistance required.
