Jane Bell, from Galashiels in the Scottish Borders, got into difficulty at the Dalmeny Hotel in St Annes on 14 August 2014.
She was swimming in the hotel's main pool with no flotation devices when she went into the 7ft (2m) deep end.
Staff had received no emergency response training, the inquest heard.
The girl had been in the water for almost two minutes when former lifeguard and hotel guest Carole Greenwood dived in and brought her onto the poolside.
CCTV footage of the rescue and revival attempts by Mrs Greenwood and off duty paramedic James Pendlebury were shown to the inquest.
Paramedics initially took Jane to Blackpool Victoria Hospital before she was transferred to Royal Manchester Children's Hospital in a critical condition, where she died.
Leisure centre manager Tom Bird told the hearing that, at the time of the girl's death, the hotel's health and safety practices were dealt with by an outside consultancy.
Emergency response training for hotel staff began two months after the drowning, he said.
Jane's parents chose not to attend the inquest, which continues at Blackpool Town Hall.
