The iOS 9.3 update caused some older versions of the phones and tablets to require the IDs and passwords previously used to set them up.
Many people complained that their machines had become unusable because they had forgotten or did not know the details.
Apple has detailed a workaround.
It has also stopped vulnerable devices being able to download the software and begun issuing new versions of the operating system - which ditch the ID check - for affected machines.
"In some cases, if customers do not recall their password, their device will remain in an inactivated state until they can recover or reset their password," Apple said in a statement.
"For these older devices, we have temporarily pulled back the update and will release an updated version of iOS 9.3 in the next few days that does not require this step."
Dozens of users complained about the problem on Apple's community forum saying their handsets and tablets had been "bricked" after installing the update.
The tech firm has since acknowledged that the issue affected its iPhone 5S and earlier smartphones as well as its iPad Air and earlier tablets.
As a solution, Apple suggested that users remove the activation lock by signing into their iCloud account's Find My Phone function or by connecting their device to a computer and entering their current Apple ID details into iTunes.
But some users will still face problems if their current account had not been linked to the device and they still want to keep data stored on it.
One iPhone owner who inherited an iPhone from a deceased partner has reported still being unable to bypass the lock, as has someone who bought the device from a seller that they were no longer in contact with.
Under such circumstances, Apple says people need to contact its support team for further aid.
