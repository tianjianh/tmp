[SN]TITLE[SN]
Paris St-Germain 3-0 Saint-Etienne

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Edinson Cavani scored twice as Paris St-Germain beat Saint-Etienne to make it four wins out of four in Ligue 1.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
He scored the opener from a penalty after he was fouled by Saidy Janko.
Thiago Motta then scored the second after Marquinhos chested down a free-kick from Neymar - who was lively throughout with tricks and flicks.
And Cavani turned home a late third with his heel from substitute Julian Draxler's cross to ensure PSG remain top of the league.
Saint-Etienne - who had also won their opening three games - were better than the scoreline suggests and had 12 shots to PSG's 14.
It was the first game £200m world record signing Neymar has not scored in for PSG, having netted three and assisted three others in his first two matches.
