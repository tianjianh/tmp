Ospreys' Sam Davies should start for Wales against Japan on Saturday, says former captain Gareth Thomas.

Interim coach Rob Howley said he will rest some of his more experienced players after they followed a defeat by Australia with victory over Argentina.
Former Wales utility back Thomas hopes Pro12 performances are rewarded.
"I would go for Sam Davies because at regional level he has been the 10 that has done consistently well," Thomas, 42, told Scrum V.
Davies' Ospreys team-mate Dan Biggar is Wales' established fly-half, with Cardiff Blues' versatile Gareth Anscombe the other regular 10 in the national squad.
Thomas said: "Sam has been the in-form 10 probably out of all the regions, even in front of Dan at stages, so I think you have to reward that."
Thomas also hopes another winger Keelan Giles, another Ospreys player, is given his chance against Japan.
"We have some great players to come in and this is the time," said the former British and Irish Lion.
"When else do we get the time on international level - really apart from a Lions year, when there's a tour that goes on outside the Lions - to give players the chance to impress?
"So we've got the likes of Sam Davies and Keelan Giles."
Thomas also warned Wales they should not underestimate Japan.
The ex-Bridgend, Celtic Warriors and Cardiff Blues player said: "We can't afford to take them lightly, but also we do not need to think that all of a sudden we're a bad team.
"We should expect to beat Japan with our fringe players, there's no doubt about that."
