Eddie Jones: George Ford excited about England's new era

England fly-half George Ford has said he is looking forward to an "exciting era" under new head coach Eddie Jones.

The former Australia and Japan boss last week signed a four-year contract to replace Stuart Lancaster.
Ford, likely to be a key part of Jones' plans in the Six Nations, said: "I'm sure all the English boys are trying to put their best foot forward.
"He obviously did a great job with Japan in the World Cup and he has a great CV which speaks for itself."
The 55-year-old Australian, England's first foreign coach, will start work in December and his first match will be England's Six Nations opener against Scotland at Murrayfield on 6 February.
Ford told BBC Radio 5 live: "I've spoken to some team-mates [at Bath] who have worked under him, and they are all full of positive things, so I'm looking forward to it."
Ford kicked a late penalty to seal victory for Bath against Leinster in the European Champions Cup on Saturday, and impressed along with another England hopeful, centre Kyle Eastmond.
"Ultimately you've got to play as well as you can [for your club], and perform on the weekend," Ford added.
Meanwhile, Bath head coach Mike Ford said the Rugby Football Union had made the right call in appointing someone of Jones' experience.
"The more experience you have, the better coach you are," he told BBC Radio 5 live.
"He's been to a World Cup final with Australia, was a consultant when South Africa beat us in 2007, and he's done really well with Japan.
"He's coached in different continents, he's got loads of experience, so I think it's a good appointment."
