Ex-England midfielder Gerrard, 34, will move to the United States at the end of the season after 25 years at Liverpool.
Frank Lampard, 36, signed for New York City after leaving Chelsea, but then joined Manchester City on a short-term deal before extending his stay.
"Gerrard's focus will be LA Galaxy," Klein told BBC Radio 5 live.

He added that the Reds captain will make his debut on 17 July against San Jose.
Gerrard, who has won 10 trophies at Liverpool, including the Champions League in 2005, becomes the second England captain to join LA Galaxy.
David Beckham played for the MLS side between 2007 and 2012.
"Signing Steven ranks right up there and we're very excited about it," said Klein. "The attention it has created has been incredible. He's a worldwide name and people are very excited."
Beckham was followed to the MLS by other big-name signings from the Premier League, including Tim Cahill, Jemain Defoe and Robbie Keane.
Former Liverpool defender and MLS head coach Steve Nicol said Gerrard's signing will be another huge boost for the American league.
"It is on a par with Thierry Henry and David Beckham," Nicol told BBC Sport. "Gerrard is a world superstar, it can't be any better for the league.

"He is in a position where his football is world-class. His touch, vision and control and what he will do for the football team is incredible."
Meanwhile, former LA Galaxy manager Ruud Gullit said Gerrard, who decided against a move to Chelsea in 2005, should have left Anfield earlier in his career to win more trophies.
"Everybody knows that he loves Liverpool," Gullit told BBC Sport. "But if you look at his whole career, he would have wanted to have more on it.
"For me, he should have done it before, not because I don't like Liverpool, but as a player you need to have different experiences.
"To become really one of the biggest players England has ever had, you need to have trophies and he wanted to have them."
