Games debutant Rissveds, 22, and Wloszczowska, 32, were at the head of the field for much of the race before the Swede pulled clear in the last lap.
Rissveds finished in 1:30:15, with Wloszczowska 37 seconds behind and Canada's Catharine Prendel third.
Sweden won its second Rio 2016 gold after swimmer Sarah Sjostrom won the 100m butterfly.
Rissveds, the under-23 champion for 2016, battled illness and an elbow injury this year and only returned to competition in March 2016.
Wloszczowska's silver matched her finish at Beijing 2008, while reigning world champion Annika Langvad of Denmark finished in 11th place more than three minutes behind Rissveds.
