[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 20-year-old thwarted Willie Gibson in each half and also blocked Craig Malcolm's header.
Ally Love had Rovers' best chance before the break when he went clear on goal but keeper Cameron Belford was up to the task.
Craig Pettigrew had a shot deflected wide for the hosts and he too was foiled by Stewart.
