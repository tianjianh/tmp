Ronnie O'Sullivan claims he is now more a snooker pundit than a player

Ronnie O'Sullivan says he is "blagging it" as a snooker player - because he would rather enjoy life than spend hours practising.

O'Sullivan, 40, beat Scotland's Rhys Clark 6-0 in his second-round match at the UK Championship in York.
But the five-time UK champion said: "I try to still be as competitive as I can, but if not, it is a lot easier being a pundit than playing.
"I really do enjoy the pundit work much more than playing."
O'Sullivan, who beat Thailand's Boonyarit Keattikun 6-0 in just 56 minutes in his first-round match, added: "I love playing when you have the matches but all the practice  - I am not a lover of that.

"You used to have football player managers. I see myself as a pundit snooker player.
"Rather than drive myself mad and play this game and think 'that's all I have got', I try to embrace different things which take the pressure off."
The world number eight plays Londoner Michael Georgiou in the third round on Monday, as he looks earn a sixth victory in an event he first won in 1993.
A winner of 28 ranking events, including five world championship titles, O'Sullivan said he was not a fan of the four-table set-up at the York Barbican, which stays in place until the fourth round begins on Wednesday.
He added: "With four tables, it is really difficult. There is no crowd around the sides so the atmosphere isn't great, but it is better than playing down the billiard hall. I would rather play here on a Sunday afternoon than the billiard hall.
"I don't want to spend the rest of my life hitting balls in a snooker room. I would rather be embracing a bit of life.
"I just try to blag it now and see where it goes - until I drop out and think I am not good enough to qualify for events or win. I will turn up and once I get beaten, I can go in the pundit box."
