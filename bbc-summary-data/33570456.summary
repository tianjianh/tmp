The girl group - who topped the chart with their X Factor winner's single Cannonball in 2011 and Wings in 2012 - said they were "super-duper excited".
Years and Years, who outsold the rest of the top five albums combined, called it "the best day of our lives".
Last week the chart moved from Sunday to Friday to mark Global Release Day.
All new singles and albums now come out on a Friday around the world, while BBC Radio 1 DJ Greg James reveals the official chart during his show from 18:00 BST.
Black Magic, the first single from Little Mix's forthcoming third album Get Weird, topped this week's chart with sales of 113,000, including 1.19 million streams.
"We're super-duper excited to be number one with Black Magic - we never thought we'd see the day again," the band told the Official Charts Company.
"Thank you so much to the fans... you did this."
Years and Years - who topped the BBC's Sound of 2015 list in January  added: "We're so, so, so excited! Having a number one album is a dream come true.
"Thank you everybody and everything, this is the best day of our lives. Our fans are the best and we are very, very happy today."
Their single Shine is at number two in the singles chart for a second week, while Lost Frequencies' Are You With Me is at three and DJ Sam Feldt is at number four with his rework of Robin S's 90s club classic Show Me Love.
Last week's number one, David Zowie's House Every Weekend, is at five.
In the album chart, Ed Sheeran's x dropped from number one to two, following last weekend's huge shows at Wembley Stadium.
James Bay's Chaos and the Calm was at three, with Sam Smith's In the Lonely Hour at four and Taylor Swift's 1989 at number five.
