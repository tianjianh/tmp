Lake District leaning boulder plunges down Lord Rake ravine

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A huge rock pillar which has leaned across a ravine in the Lake District for almost a decade has collapsed.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The boulder plunged down Lords Rake steep gully on the route between England's highest mountain, Scafell Pike, and its neighbour, Scafell.
The Wasdale Mountain Rescue team said climbers should be wary of "loose, falling rocks".
They are also being urged to dress properly for the terrain.
A spokesman for the rescue team said: "The perched block at the top of Lords Rake has fragmented and is now in bits close to where it was stuck.
"There are some loose boulders where it was standing. The largest bit looks to be fairly well bedded into the scree. The rake itself is just as loose as ever.
"As always, people walking in such areas should remain vigilant for falling rocks and go out suitably dressed and experienced for such a route."
