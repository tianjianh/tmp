Part of the M25 in Essex was closed for more than three hours following a five vehicle crash, police said.

The collision in Thurrock happened at about 11:30 BST on the anti-clockwise road between junction 31 and 30, for Lakeside, after the Dartford Tunnel.
It involved three articulated lorries and two cars. One driver is reported to have been injured.
Both tunnels finally reopened just after 15:00 BST but there were still queues back to before junction four.
Traffic was also heavy on the clockwise carriageway over the Queen Elizabeth II bridge as drivers slowed to look at the crash site.
Filippo Marozzelli, a driver stuck in the anticlockwise queues, tweeted a picture of what he could see with the caption: "Engine off".
