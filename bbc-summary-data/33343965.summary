[SN]TITLE[SN]
Metro and M4

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
There won't be a Welsh government cabinet reshuffle ahead of the assembly election in the light of the decision by the economy minister Edwina Hart to retire from politics next year.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
It means she can plough on with the kind of transport projects she would undoubtedly like to leave as her legacy.
It also means that if the first minister has to make way for a Plaid economy minister in a potential coalition next year then he won't have to remove a Labour minister who had just been given the portfolio.
Edwina Hart this week set out more details on one of her two pet projects, the metro.
The other is the proposal for the Â£1bn M4 relief road. The former feels like it has a far greater chance of becoming a reality.
The latter looks difficult. Many at the assembly I speak to don't see it happening. As one political commentator told me: "It'll leave the assembly at the same time that Edwina walks out of the door."
Part of the problem is the political opposition to a new motorway by-passing Newport through the Gwent levels.
Plaid are deeply opposed. Even the Welsh Conservatives appear to be putting themselves on a collision course with the CBI over it, which isn't something you see very often.
Officially the Tories in Cardiff Bay are giving their full backing to the metro, but are deeply cautious over a new Â£1bn motorway, saying more work needs to be done on modelling.
In stark contrast, there's far greater cross-party support for the metro even though it could potentially mean even more money being poured into a network of services that largely go in and out of Cardiff.
Unlike the M4, I don't tend to hear complaints about "blowing the budget" in south-east Wales at the expense of transport improvements elsewhere.
But politically it's much more difficult to oppose improvement to the public transport network, as opposed to roads, particularly in the deprived south Wales valleys.
Lurking in the background to major infrastructure projects is the proposal for a city deal, which has become the method of choice of the Conservative government at Westminster to pump money out of London and into the nations and regions.
The leader of Cardiff council, Phil Bale, is trying to make the running on this, together with Welsh Secretary Stephen Crabb, who recently gathered a number of local authority leaders from south east-Wales together to discuss it.
The truth is nobody can work out how this is going to pan out in a devolved context.
We know there's potentially significant amounts of money available from Westminster.
The problem is it will inevitably have to be match-funded by the Welsh government and it is a long way from doing anything of the kind until it gets more detail from Westminster.
Many refer to the city deal struck for Glasgow which secured more than Â£1bn's worth of extra investment but I'd caution against any parallels.
As a senior Labour figure in the Welsh government told me: "Scotland is awash with money" and this was a deal made in the period leading up to the independence referendum when it was politically vital to display the benefits of being in the union.
No such dynamic exists here.
