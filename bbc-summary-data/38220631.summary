West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue were called to the scene of the blaze at about 04:20 BST on 19 October.
Sara Broadhead said her husband saved her life and rescued their eldest daughter before going back into the blazing building in an attempt to save his other daughter.
She said: "Andy was a brave hero who managed to save the lives of his wife and eldest daughter.
"Unfortunately he couldn't save our youngest daughter Kiera and gave his own life trying to save hers."
An online fundraising campaign, set up to help support the family after the fire, raised more than Â£12,500.
