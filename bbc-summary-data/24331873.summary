Comments: Will you be watching the Commonwealth Games?
Sporting superstars such as Usain Bolt, Mo Farah and Tom Daley are all competing in what is being billed as the biggest and best Commonwealth Games yet.
The Commonwealth is a collection of countries that are linked in some way to Great Britain, all apart from one - Mozambique.
Many years ago Britain used to control lots of countries as part of something called the British Empire.
Over the years the Empire has disappeared as countries have taken charge of themselves, and has reformed and changed to become the Commonwealth.
All 53 members have signed up to a set of values including democracy, gender equality and international peace and security.
During the opening ceremony the Games will be officially opened by the Queen, who is the head of the Commonwealth.
