A supermarket in Moray has introduced a "relaxed" lane aimed at making life at the checkout less stressful for some of its more vulnerable customers.

Checkout staff at Tesco in Forres have been trained to identify any special needs of customers and operate at a speed that suits them.
Tesco has developed the scheme with Alzheimer Scotland.
The store's Kerry Speed said: "We want them to be confident they can shop at their own pace."
She added: "It was highlighted to me that people living with dementia can feel under pressure when they reach the checkout, and it struck me that this could be true for others as well.
"Early feedback from customers has been very positive. Although it's a simple gesture, we hope this will make a difference."
Wendy Menzies, of Alzheimer Scotland, said: "We welcome this new pilot scheme which will help people with dementia to feel confident in continuing to shop independently in their local community for longer."
The relaxed checkout pilot scheme operates on Tuesday and Wednesday mornings.
