Plan to spruce up approaches to Inverness going ahead

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Highland Council is going ahead with a project showing how approaches to Inverness by road might be improved.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A "gateway structure" - a standing stone-like monument - is to be installed at Clachnaharry on the Beauly-Inverness road.
Telford Roundabout and the A82's central reservation at the Longman are to be planted with trees and shrubs.
The council is also to hold a public consultation on how other roundabouts and sites could be spruced up.
The consultation will run for 10 weeks from 6 June.
Highland councillors approved the demonstrator project and the consultation at a meeting earlier this week.
