Into the Woods and Selma are notably missing from the 10 films, one of which will collect the prize on 24 January.

The Grand Budapest Hotel, The Imitation Game, The Theory of Everything and Whiplash also make the shortlist for the PGA's award.
So does Jake Gyllenhaal's photojournalism drama Nightcrawler, a surprise nominee according to trade paper Variety.
Five more titles make the cut for the PGA's animated film producer prize, among them The Lego Movie, Big Hero 6 and How to Train Your Dragon 2.
Brad Pitt's production company Plan B will receive a special award at this year's ceremony, to be held at the Hyatt Regency Century Plaza in Los Angeles.
