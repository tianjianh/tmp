They have been named locally as Jacob Hocking, Jackson Edwards and Adam Richards, all local men, who died in the collision at Druid traffic lights, Corwen, on Saturday at 11:40 GMT.
A Merseyside man, who was in the other car, later died in hospital.
Corwen Town Council chairman Simon Watkins said the community was in shock.
"Our hearts go out to the families and friends involved," he said.
A book of condolences has been opened in the town.
Friend Jess Moreton, who knew the men, said: "It's heartbreaking."
North Wales Police have appealed for witnesses to the incident.
Officers want to speak to a woman in a small, red vehicle and two people in a black 4x4 who helped at the scene.
Floral tributes have been left in the town which was already in shock following the death of a woman in her 80s who was hit by a lorry on Friday.
