A £1bn plan to regenerate Birkenhead has been unveiled, five months after a previous £30m development plan was scrapped.

Wirral Council has said it is looking for investors to develop areas around the Woodside ferry terminal, the town centre and Hamilton Square.
It revealed the plan at MIPIM, Europe's largest property expo in Cannes.
An earlier scheme was abandoned in October as the authority sought "more ambitious" plans.
Council leader Phil Davies said there was "global interest" in the proposals.
"I can only report that I've never had so much interest in the last year or so from people who want to invest in Wirral, particularly in Birkenhead," he said.
"We've had an incredible amount of interest."
The proposal includes money for outlying areas, with plans to redevelop the Woodside waterfront and build residential accommodation with views over Liverpool also announced.
