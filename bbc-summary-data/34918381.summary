The blazes have destroyed homes and at least 13 people have been hospitalised, with five in a critical condition, according to local media.
Firefighters worked through the night to contain a major blaze which tore through 900 sq km (347 sq miles) of land north of Adelaide.
The SA Country Fire Service warned the fires could continue for several days.
One person was found dead on a property near Pinery, while a second was located in a car near the Hamley Bridge area, Premier Jay Weatherill told local media.
"This has been a devastating few hours for large parts of the state and unfortunately there is some time to go until we have the fire fronts under control.
"Our thoughts turn to those people affected and those volunteers working through the night to protect us," he said.
Extra fire crews were travelling from interstate to help battle the fires.
