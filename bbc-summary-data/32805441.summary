The telecommunications giant wants to try out new technology that can transmit data at very high speeds - hundreds of megabits a second.
It will also set up a test laboratory in its tower in the city.
Academic researchers, start-ups and communications providers can test new technologies at the laboratory.
BT said the trials will focus on delivering the new service to blocks of flats and business premises, following tests of what it calls 'G.Fast' technology at its labs in Suffolk.
"BT's research into ultrafast 'G.fast' technology is now moving out of the labs and into the field," said BT's head of operations, Mike Galvin.
"Our technical trial will allow us to evaluate the best way of delivering ultrafast speeds to flats and business premises nationwide."
The company recently announced plans to roll out the new technology across the UK over the next decade, in a bid to deliver broadband speeds of up to 500Mbps to homes and businesses.
According to the regulator Ofcom, the current average broadband speeds across Britain stand at 23Mbps.
