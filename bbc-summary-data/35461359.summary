Sean Diver, 39, was last seen in the Townsend Street area on 27 January.
He is described as being abut 5ft 7in tall, of a slim build and with brown hair.  He also has tattoos on his neck.
Police and other emergency services have been carrying out searches in the town.
Police have asked farmers and landowners in the Strabane, Sion Mills and Lifford areas to check any outhouses.
Mr Diver's brother, Mark, told BBC Radio Foyle "he hasn't contacted anyone.
"This is totally out of his character. We've been out every day looking for him. We found a phone but it turned out it wasn't his.
"As each day goes by, we just think he is in the water. We are fearing the worst."
"My mother hasn't moved from the chair," Mr Diver added.
"She breaks down. She just expects him to come through the door. She is still hopeful.
"He has a young daughter at the age of 12. She is a daddy's girl.
"I want him to please send us a message through somebody to let us know he is safe.
"We miss him and want him back."
