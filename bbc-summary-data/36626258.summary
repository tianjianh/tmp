[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Jamie Overton's devastating spell of pace bowling gave Somerset the upper hand going into day two of their Division One match against Hampshire.

Hampshire were 118-2 when Jimmy Adams fell for 61, limping to 184-4 before Overton's burst of five wickets in four overs earned him his second five-wicket haul in the County Championship (5-42).
The hosts were bowled out for 219 when Tino Best fell to Craig Overton (3-52).
Skipper Chris Rogers was removed for a duck as Somerset closed on 66-1.
Bad light stopped play on a day defined by an afternoon session that the visitors totally dominated.
Craig Overton took the wicket of Will Smith (32) just before lunch, then had Adams was caught brilliantly by Marcus Trescothick in the slips, while Tom Alsop was leg-before to Jim Allenby.
Liam Dawson was then bowled by Allenby to spark a run of six wickets in seven overs that left Hampshire's decision to bat after winning the toss looking like a poor one.
Jamie Overton did the damage, having Michael Carberry caught at cover by Rogers and Sean Ervine caught behind.
Lewis McManus, Gareth Berg and Mason Crane then all fell for a combined one run as Somerset compounded the misery of Division One's bottom side.
Hampshire coach Dale Benkenstein told BBC Radio Solent:
"In this division and this standard of cricket you should know by now you don't give sides opportunities to get back into the game.
"I felt we were really on top of them and just opened the door. We played some really loose shots.
"But to their credit once they got their chance they bowled very well. That wicket was flat and we were probably 250 runs short."
