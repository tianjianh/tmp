Diego Costa's first-half shot was deflected wide for the visitors, while Etienne Capoue's fierce drive was kept out by Chelsea keeper Thibaut Courtois.
Heurelho Gomes's superb one-handed save from Costa's header denied Chelsea victory late on.
The draw moves Chelsea up to 13th on 29 points, while Watford are four points and four places better off.
Re-live Watford's draw with Chelsea
Watford started their first season back in the Premier League in blistering fashion, with eight wins before Christmas propelling them into the top 10.
However, that form took a turn for the worse as they lost four successive league games from 28 December.
Hornets boss Quique Sanchez Flores brought in Costel Pantilimon from Sunderland during the January transfer window and if his intention was to challenge his first-choice keeper to raise his game, it appears to have worked.
Gomes put in a man-of-the-match performance against Chelsea, reacting swiftly to keep out Branislav Ivanovic from close range and Costa in the final few minutes.
"I believe the goalkeeper has to do things like that [make key saves]," Gomes told BBC Sport.
"We got a point against a very good side and I was glad to make a difference."
This game saw both the best and worst of Costa.
The striker, particularly in the first half, was at it his bustling best - a particular highlight was the moment he brought down and controlled Cesc Fabregas' long ball, and turned Watford defenders inside out before shooting just wide.
However, he also struggled to control his temper after he was pulled up by referee Mike Dean for shoving over Sebastian Prodl in the Watford box. He got involved in an angry exchange with Juan Carlos Paredes that led to both players been booked.
Chelsea defender John Terry caused a bit of a stir on Sunday when he announced that he will leave the club this summer, saying he had not been offered a new deal.
Hiddink suggested on Tuesday that the Stamford Bridge door was not closed, however, and fans who travelled to Vicarage Road showed their support for their long-serving captain.
There was a loud cheer when his name was read out before kick-off, while some fans held up banners with the words "Captain, Leader, Legend" on them.
Generally, the 35-year-old was solid against Watford, although a misjudged jump in his attempt to clear a cross for Odion Ighalo hinted at why his time at the heart of the Chelsea defence could be coming to an end.
Watford boss Quique Sanchez Flores: "We're happy. We've shown we can get points against the big teams - you see it against Liverpool, Chelsea, Manchester City and Tottenham.

"The competitive level of the team is very high."
Chelsea interim boss Guus Hiddink on incident involving Costa and Watford's Paredes: "It was clear and in front of our eyes. Costa was punched in the back and then he stumbled and brought his hands to his head. I was trying to protect my player because he was provoked.

"This league is physical. When you see our central defenders and our opponent's central defenders. He [Costa] likes to go physical but he must do within the rules. Some times players get physical and he has to get used to that."
On Terry: "First we'll see him often this season. What the future brings is up to him and the club."
Watford travel to Tottenham in the Premier League on Saturday while Chelsea host Manchester United on the following day.
