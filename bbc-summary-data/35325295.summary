A care worker who sexually abused children in care could have been stopped years earlier, a victim claims.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Leslie Paul, 64, from Islington, north London, was sentenced on Thursday for child sex offences at a Lambeth children's home between 1980 and 1988.
When a victim reported the abuse to council staff, he said he was moved from the home but Paul was not and abused boys for a further six years.
In light of this claim, Lambeth Council said it would review its records.
The male victim, who cannot be identified for legal reasons, said: "As a child you make these reports and they decided to move me away and to leave that man in Lambeth social services for at least another six years where he abused more children."
The victim said on one occasion he was driven to a house where four men raped him, in what the sentencing judge John Hillen  described as "a vile attack".
Paul was found guilty in December of 15 indecent assaults, one count of indecency with a child under 14, and one count of aiding and abetting indecent assault on a boy under 14.
He pleaded guilty to one count of making an indecent image of a child on or after 1 January 2005.
Lambeth Council said it was "appalled at the horrific abuse" committed by Leslie Paul and had provided the Met with information that led to Paul's prosecution. It said it would continue to work with police investigating historic abuse in the borough.
"The information used to bring this prosecution will also be presented to the Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse led by Justice Lowell Goddard. The inquiry's first investigation will be into the extent of any institutional failures to protect children in the care of Lambeth Council from sexual abuse and exploitation," a spokesman added.
"In the light of subsequent comments we are reviewing our records to see if additional action is needed, and if there is more information that needs to be provided to the police and the Goddard inquiry in relation to Leslie Paul's employment," he said.
