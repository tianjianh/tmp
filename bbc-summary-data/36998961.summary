Martyn Waghorn: Rangers await verdict on injured striker

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Rangers manager Mark Warburton is waiting to discover the full extent of Martyn Waghorn's suspected hamstring injury.

The striker hobbled off late on in Saturday's 1-1 draw with Hamilton, and will be assessed on Sunday by medics.
"It's too early to tell how bad it is, so we will see," Warburton said. "He is being treated but we will need to see how he presents in the morning.
"Martyn is a goal-scorer but you don't want to lose any player to injury."
Waghorn scored his fifth goal of the season when he equalised after an hour against Hamilton, who took the lead before the break though Ali Crawford.
The striker pulled up as he chased the ball eight minutes before the end, and was clearly in distress as he left the field after treatment.
Hamilton were dogged and intrepid opponents at Ibrox, deservedly taking the lead. It took the introduction of substitute Harry Forrester after the break for Rangers to find their range in front of goal, and he created the equaliser with a sweeping outside-of-the-foot pass.
Joey Barton, who made his league debut for Rangers, insists they will recover from dropping two points, and admitted Martin Canning's side provided a stern test in their opening Premiership game.
"The league wasn't going to be won today and it certainly wasn't lost," Barton said to Sky Sports.
"It was tough. Hamilton came here and executed their game plan quite well.
"People expected us to just turn up and win, but that doesn't happen. You need to earn the right to win games.
"We had the momentum, so it was unfortunate that Waggy was injured. It wasn't the ideal result, but we'll build on this."
Rangers chairman Dave King, also speaking to Sky Sports, said efforts continue to resolve the ongoing issues with retail partners Sports Direct and kit suppliers Puma.
Replica strips were put on public sale last week, even though Rangers said they were "not party to the discussion" to sell them. The club previously withdrew Sports Directs' right to sell merchandise bearing Rangers' trademarks.
"The situation is far more under control than it was a few months ago," King said.
"We've made a lot of progress, although there are some areas of sensitivity with Puma.
"We regard our contracts as very important. Puma are caught up in this. We need to find a balance between doing what is right for the club and the legal situation that means we can take some action.
"Puma have been supportive and we're going to try to find a way out that suits both us."
King also reiterated that Rangers are unhappy with elements of Sheriff Principal Edward Bowen's independent report into the pitch invasion following May's Scottish Cup final with Hibernian.
The report was published by the Scottish Football Association on Friday, and Rangers reacted by claiming it contained "a number of factual inaccuracies and contradictions", with the club seeking talks with Bowen and the SFA.
"We were looking for recognition of what went wrong and to make sure it won't happen again," King said. "That's not been achieved."
