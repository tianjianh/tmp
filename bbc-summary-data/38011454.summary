The presenter has joined the current series ITV reality show at a late stage and will enter the jungle on Thursday.
He said: "I have been doing telly for 40 years, I'm 60 next year and I've got no ambition to be on telly anymore.
"The only show I've ever wanted to do is this. It's like being asked to do a West End musical."
He added: "This is, in modern TV, as good as it gets. They fly you around the world, put you in a hotel with a beach, then you play games in the jungle."
The 59-year-old was diagnosed with cancer of the throat and mouth in 2010 but was given the all-clear the following year.
Baker said he is now considering moving away from the UK once he turns 60 in June.
He said: "Next summer I am even thinking about living in America. So when this came around, rather than disappearing quietly, I thought 'why not do one last big television programme?'"
"I just don't want to do any more telly or radio or anything else after June, when I'm 60. But I may as well write, that's easy to do sitting on the edge of the ocean."
Baker has released two autobiographies and plans to publish a third in February.
The broadcaster also spoke about the BBC's decision to part company with Tony Blackburn earlier this year.
The Radio 2 DJ exited the corporation in February after the BBC said he had failed to fully co-operate with the Jimmy Savile sex abuse inquiry,
It was announced last month that Blackburn would return to the BBC to present a Friday evening programme on Radio 2.
Speaking about Blackburn's departure, Baker said: "I thought it was revolting. I thought it was a load of cowardly management trying to say, 'Yeah, we can do the right thing.'
"But they did the wrong thing. He was a scapegoat. He entirely was, and now they've had to eat humble pie."
Last month, the BBC said it "stands by the findings of Dame Janet Smith and the decision it made to take Tony Blackburn off air at the start of this year".
"Tony Blackburn for his part stands by his statements to Dame Janet Smith but recognises that the BBC considered a period off air was appropriate."
Blackburn said: "I do not seek to criticise the BBC for decisions it has made in the past."
The BBC said it had nothing further to add to last month's comments.
