While no team won more away games than Exeter this season, only three sides suffered more defeats at home.
The first leg against Carlisle finished 3-3 at Brunton Park on Sunday.
"There's something wrong if it's not a great atmosphere, because what more do people want?" Perryman told BBC Devon.
"You sometimes think there's a bit of negativity at home."
In the three matches involving the two sides this season there have been 16 goals, with Carlisle coming from behind in each game to earn two wins and a draw.
The play-off return game at St James Park has sold out, while 571 Exeter fans made the 694-mile round trip to Carlisle.
Asked about their away support, Perryman said: "Unbelievable, and yet they've been like that all season - we've given something to cheer, to be fair, with a great away record and we play a lot of quality football.
"I'd say that if there was similar noise, if there was more positive noise at home, I think you'd see more games like that.
"Don't anyone tell me that this manager [Paul Tisdale] lacks passion, don't tell me he lacks balls to make the decisions, to play forward and go for it."
