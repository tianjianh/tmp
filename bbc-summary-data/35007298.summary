Hopeless Christmas trees spreading more chuckles than cheer

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
After a Christmas tree that leans "more than the tower in Pisa" was taken down in Nottinghamshire, we look at England's worst festive offerings.

The 35ft Beeston tree was left pushed to the side by strong winds and had to be replaced.
Adam Guest, 20, from nearby Chilwell, said people are "practically laughing at it because it's so slanted".
The tree is not alone - around England spindly firs and artificial trees are causing mirth among residents.
One in Leicestershire was unfavourably likened to a wizard's hat from the Disney cartoon Fantasia and another tree in Cambridgeshire compared to a plate of chocolates.
In the village of Stockton Heath, Warrington, the tree had to be replaced before the Christmas light switch-on as it was described as "more a twig than a tree."
And Liscard on the Wirral had to have a separate Christmas in April this year as its Christmas tree was so widely criticised for being "depressing".
The 2014 Liscard Christmas tree was voted seventh in the 13 Worst Christmas trees in Britain by Buzzfeed.
This year's tree was then targeted by vandals who stole its baubles from the bottom section.
Councillor Bernie Mooney said she hoped the setback would not stop people in Liscard feeling festive.
In Cambridgeshire, Peterborough's Christmas tree was likened by a councillor to a huge plate of Ferrero Rocher chocolates.
Liberal Democrat Councillor Darren Fower started a petition about the £40,000 tree and said he witnessed a groundswell of objections about the cost.
He said: "Remember the old days when we had a real Christmas tree in Cathedral Square? I'd very much like to know who made the decision to buy the tree, where it was purchased from, is the plastic recyclable and how much electricity is it costing to run?"
"Everyone agrees - one of my polls was well over 85% who agreed it was a waste of money," he told the BBC.
If you have pictures of terrible Christmas trees you can tweet @BBC England or comment on the story on BBC England's Facebook page.
Giant pair of pants
A campaign has also begun in Birstall, Leicestershire, to replace its "rubbish" artificial pine cone tree with a real fir.
The distinctive £21,000 blue tree has been compared, unflatteringly, to the hat worn by cartoon character Mickey Mouse in the film Fantasia.
Writing on BBC Leicester's Facebook page, Pamela Joy Riley wrote: "Doesn't look like any Xmas tree I've ever seen and it's blue. Absolutely awful especially for that price."
Chair of the parish council Anne Marshall previously told the BBC they had tried to improve their decorations after taking a great deal of criticism over the last two or three years.
Some trees have needed a bit of TLC, Rochford's tree in Essex was restored after it was vandalised and a tree in Cockermouth, Cumbria, was uprooted in Main Street in the devastating floods.
In Tiverton, Devon, the Christmas lights were likened to a giant pair of pants. The £15,000 lights will remain part of the town's displays for the next three years.
A tree outside Lewisham police station was mocked on Twitter by Rachel Hiley for looking as if it had been kettled.
