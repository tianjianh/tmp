A mother of two who is battling a rare form of cancer has been "amazed" at the response to a bucket list of things she wants to achieve before she dies.

Heidi Loughlin, of Portishead was diagnosed with breast cancer last year and detailed her wishlist on the BBC Radio Bristol Facebook page on Monday.
Among the items on the list were a road trip across America and to marry her partner of 10 years, Keith Smith.
She has since been inundated with offers of help from all over the world.
The kind gestures include a free-of-charge apartment in the French alps for skiing and a trip in the cockpit of a plane for her sons, Noah and Tait.
Ms Loughlin described the response to the bucket list as "insane", and said her "jaw hit the floor" when she read the messages.
She has vowed to take up all the offers "whether it's on the list or not".
"People are amazing. I was so cynical before all this cancer malarkey, but it's really changed my outlook on so many things," she said.
"It's made me realise inherently how good people are, and how kind people are.  I can't get across how much this means to me."
The 34-year-old found she had the disease when she was pregnant with her third child last year, but delayed chemotherapy so she could continue the pregnancy.
Ali Louise was born 12 weeks early, but died eight days later.
