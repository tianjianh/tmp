"Darren was well known in the Gallatown area and I'm keen to speak to anyone who may have seen him on Saturday in the hours before he died.
"I would also ask anyone who was in the Gallatown area on Saturday and who may have seen something unusual or anyone acting suspiciously to please get in touch with us.
