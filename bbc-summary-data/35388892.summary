The Nigeria striker, who came on in the 72nd minute, grabbed the winner with a minute remaining when he fired in from close range.
He now has 10 goals in his last 15 games, and 15 in total this season.
Watford also went close through new signing Nordin Amrabat, whose volley was saved by Dorus de Vries.
Watford showed little bite until Ighalo's second-half arrival, the 26-year-old brought on for regular strike partner Troy Deeney.
With a replay looming, Ighalo capitalised on Forest's failure to clear Allan Nyom's cross when he slotted home from inside the area.
Morocco winger Amrabat, who cost Watford over Â£6m, had earlier tested De Vries twice, while the keeper also made a good stop from Scotland international Ikechi Anya.
Forest manager Dougie Freedman will have been frustrated to see his side carve out just one effort on target, when Eric Lichaj's tame half-volley was easily held by debutant Costel Pantilimon.
The home side's best chance to score came moments before Ighalo struck, Dexter Blackstock picked out by Chris Cohen in the area but failing to get his shot on target.
Forest manager Dougie Freedman: "Overall I think we have contributed to a fantastic game today. In the first half we stood off a little bit too much - I think we paid them too much respect, although saying that we had the best chance of the game in the 45th minute.
"Second half we got at them and showed we could win this tie. We moved up a gear, had some exciting moments and created enough chances to win the game but half a chance and Watford have got the winner.
"Did they deserve it? No they didn't. But as long as I can see commitment in our performances we'll keep on marching forward."
Watford boss Quique Sanchez Flores: "Forest are a good team, but we controlled the match, had more possession and created more chances.
"Amrabat needs to know the system and the team-mates. He also needs to get used to the football in England.
"We were happy with the presence of Pantilimon and Amrabat today."
