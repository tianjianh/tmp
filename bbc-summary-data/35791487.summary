Brad Inman's last-minute penalty miss handed 10-man Blackpool a vital League One win over fellow strugglers Crewe.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Jack Redshaw headed the Seasiders in front on 34 minutes before being sent off for a rash challenge on David Fox.
Crewe levelled through Marcus Haber's neat flick on 83 minutes before Tom Aldred's deflected shot restored Blackpool's advantage 60 seconds later.
Brad Potts then fouled Tom Hitchcock in the box, but top scorer Inman blazed the resulting penalty over the bar.
Blackpool climb two places to 20th, one point above the drop zone, while Crewe stay 23rd, now eight points from safety, having not won in eight matches.
