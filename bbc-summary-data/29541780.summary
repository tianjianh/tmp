Northampton-born Henry George Gawthorn was one of the artists who created the five pre-war posters to promote East Anglia's seaside resorts.
The artworks, produced between 1923 and 1947, will be sold at Swann Galleries.
The colourful posters were commissioned by rail companies and displayed on station platforms and waiting rooms.
In recent years the artworks have become increasingly fashionable, auctioneers said.
In 2002, a poster produced by Henry George Gawthorn for the London and North Eastern Railway featuring St Andrews in Scotland, sold for more than £21,000, three times its top estimate.
