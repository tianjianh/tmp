[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A new Puerto Rican reality TV show is to be made in Scotland next month.

Check In will involve celebrity comedians from the country travelling to the UK before visiting various places by minivan.
In Scotland, the show will be filmed at Loch Ness and in Edinburgh. Before heading north, the programme will be filmed at Stonehenge and in Liverpool.
One of the show's co-creators, Arnaldo Santiago Rivera, was due to visit the places this week ahead of filming.
Mr Santiago Rivera, president and founder of online marketing agency Digital Lab, and Sixto George, executive producer of media enterprise SBS Puerto Rico, created the show.
They said the show would seek to "immerse Puerto Rican celebrities in the host country's culture".
It will also show "interactions between different cultures, interesting facts about the people, history and gastronomy".
Puerto Rican comedians Jorge Pabon and Robert Ferran have been lined up for the show.
Mr Santiago Rivera said: "The UK is an exciting and vibrant country with such a diverse population.
"I thought that it would be a fantastic opportunity for Jorge and Robert to see the country not from a tourist's perception but to be fully immersed in its culture and experience things that they wouldn't necessarily experience if they were to come the UK on holiday."
