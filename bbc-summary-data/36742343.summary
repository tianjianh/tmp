Plans to host an MTV music festival in Belfast later this year have been dropped by Belfast City Council.

The event promised to bring some big name artists to the city.
MTV is one of the world's most valuable brands with a reach into over 400 million homes.
It had been in discussion with the council to hold a mini festival in the city this autumn, with the council keen to promote the event to showcase Belfast to a worldwide audience.
But now the council says it will not be happening.
A spokesperson said: "The MTV gig planned for September is not going ahead due to a number of other competing musical events during the same month."
Councillors had agreed to financially underwrite the cost of the two day music event up to a maximum of Â£300,000.
Ulster Unionist councillor David Browne said he opposed the use of ratepayers money for such events.
"I feel that the council is sometimes very generous with incentives to bring some of these things to Belfast and Â£300,000 to me is a lot of money that could have went somewhere more important and much more deserving," he said.
"I will not be losing any sleep over the fact that this concert has been cancelled."
SDLP councillor Patrick Convery, who was deputy lord mayor of Belfast the last time MTV came to Belfast in 2011, said the timing of the event was unfortunate.
"All of these opportunities that come up from MTV, they give us a chance to promote and sell our city internationally, both across Europe and across the world," he said.
"However, when our team of events organisers looked at this, there were a whole load of other events happening in the city around about the same time so scheduling was a very important thing.
"You just can't put all of the events on in one month."
