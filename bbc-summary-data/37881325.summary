[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
League Two leaders Plymouth Argyle set a club record of seven successive away wins after coming back to beat Crewe.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Alex Kiwomya gave Crewe an early lead, and Alex should have been further ahead but George Cooper's penalty was saved after David Fox fouled Jamie Jones, before he hit the bar a minute later.
Craig Tanner levelled just before half time with a curling right-footed shot.
Graham Carey sealed the win by shooting home from 10 yards after a good low cross from Jake Jervis.
The win extended Argyle's lead at the top to seven points after second-placed Carlisle were beaten for the first time this season at bottom-of-the-table Newport County.
Despite the loss, Crewe moved up a place to sixth on goal difference thanks to Notts County's 4-0 loss at Blackpool.
