Most of the night's performers, including Little Mix and Jess Glynne, are non-movers in the album chart.
Adele remains at number one, but the BBC understands that sales of 25 have not increased noticeably week-on-week.
Singer-songwriter James Bay is the most noticeable exception, rising 10 places to number seven.
The highest new entry in this week's Official Album Chart came from Jack Garratt, winner of the Brits critics' choice award.
Although he did not get the chance to perform at the show, his debut album, Phase, debuts at number three.
It had been number one in Monday's midweek chart update, but sales fell behind Adele's album and the Best of Bowie retrospective towards the end of the week.
With the Brits ceremony taking place just 24 hours before the chart deadline, many of the performers and winners could see a sales boost in next week's countdown.
They have already seen some gains in the more volatile singles chart, where Rihanna's duet with Drake - Work - achieves a new peak, rising one place to number two.
Coldplay, who opened the Brits on Wednesday, see their Beyonce collaboration Hymn for the Weekend climb seven places to number 10.
Adele's When We Were Young - the final song to be performed at the ceremony - also rises 10 places, landing at 13.
The number one single is unchanged, Danish band Lukas Graham scoring a third week at the top with their reflective ballad 7 Years.
The track enjoyed its second-biggest week since its release, achieving a combined sales and streams figure of 131,000. It is also the most-played song on UK radio at the moment.
"It's amazing, very weird," front man Lukas Forchhammer told BBC Newsbeat earlier this week when asked about the song's success in the UK.
The song was the band's fourth chart-topper in their home country last summer, spending five weeks at number one before being replaced by their next single Strip No More.
Back in the album chart, Irish star and Strictly Come Dancing contestant Daniel O'Donnell scored a new entry at 13 with his best of collection, Music and Memories.
Foo Fighters' new EP Saint Cecilia, dedicated to the victims of last November's terrorist attacks in Paris, is also new at 35.
Next week's Top 40 is likely to see new entries from The 1975 and the late David Bowie.
The latter is down to the psothumous release a two-CD set, Back in Anger, featuring unreleased radio performances backed by experimental rock band Nine Inch Nails.
