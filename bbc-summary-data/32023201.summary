The bomb, measuring 5ft in length and weighing 1000lb, has been found in Southwark by builders, the Met Police said.
The force said officers were called to a building site in Grange Walk at 09:18 GMT. Two schools have been evacuated.
A cordon and a 400m exclusion zone have been put in place as a precaution.
Traffic is being diverted and several roads are closed. The council said there was "major disruption" in the area especially around Tower Bridge and Grange Walk.
It advised people to find other routes home.
The Met said it was working with the London Fire Brigade, London Ambulance Service and Southwark Council.
Leader of Southwark Council, Councillor Peter John, said: "I can understand how worrying this is for local people, and the council is doing all we can to support them while the emergency services make the area safe."
He said there were "well-rehearsed" emergency plans in place and urged residents to go to one of the council's rest centres in Canada Water for hot meals, tea and coffee.
