Faissal El Bakhtaoui met a Haber cross at the front post to prod the home side ahead after 15 minutes.
Haber was the creator again as he chested the ball into the path of Kostadin Gadzhalov to extend the lead three minutes before the break.
It was Haber pressuring Steven Anderson for the third after 57 minutes, with the Saints man with the final touch.
The Perth side had arrived at Dens Park hoping for a win that would draw them level with fourth-placed Hearts.
But they came up against a Dundee side that showed why they are now unbeaten at home in five games.
The only thing that has been consistent this season about Paul Hartley's Dundee has been their inconsistency.
With four wins, four losses and one draw in their last nine games, it is easy to see why they have struggled to force their way up the table.
But a change of formation, enforced through a combination of injury and illness, certainly paid dividends on a blustery afternoon at Dens Park.
The opening goal came when El Bhaktaoui made a darting run towards the near post, where he connected with Haber's cross.
The home side doubled their advantage before the break when Gadzhalov volleyed home after Haber chested down a free kick into his path.
St Johnstone had the perceived benefit of a strong wind behind them in the opening 45 minutes, but they failed to cash in whenever they had sight of goal.
Blair Alston came closest with a free-kick from 25 yards out that beat goalkeeper Scott Bain but crashed off the crossbar and Murray Davidson sent a diving header over the upright after a persistent spell of pressure from the Perth side.
Tommy Wright introduced Chris Kane at the break and the striker was denied by a last-gasp block by the excellent Julen Extebeguren at the heart of the Dundee defence.
Dundee were playing with a confidence rarely witnessed so far this season and Mark O'Hara showed great tenacity and strength to set up a third for the home side.
Stealing the ball from Davidson around 25 yards from goal, he slipped the ball through to Tom Hateley and his cross into the box was met by Steven Anderson.
The Saints captain could do no more than deflect the ball beyond goalkeeper Zander Clark and into the back of his own goal.
On this evidence, Dundee will head into 2017 with optimism and can look forward to the new year.
Despite their defeat, Saints will no doubt continue to drive forward in the coming months with much to be positive about.
Dundee manager Paul Hartley: "Faissal El Bhaktaoui was terrific. He has had to adjust from two leagues down, where he scored a lot of goals.
"It was never going to be easy for him, but we have been patient and give him a little bit of confidence.
"We had to adjust our shaper today, but we felt with O'Hara, El Bhaktaoui, Haber and Wighton, we could have a real go today with six behind them.
"I think the break is coming at the right time for us.
"It's been a tough start, but if you look at our home form, with 13 points from the last 15, it's been good.
"The players need a break mentally and physically away from the club and maybe away from me for some time."
St Johnstone manager Tommy Wright: "The first goal is crucial in most games and it was today again.
"I can't be too critical in terms of how we had the ball as I felt we dominated the ball and created lots of opportunities.
"If we were guilty of anything, it was possibly just that final pass going astray and making the wrong decision.
"Ultimately, we got caught on the counter-attack and we should deal with that better.
"I am looking again at what we have achieved in this calendar year - and win lose or draw today, we have had a magnificent 2016.
"There are many clubs with more resources than we have and we do better than a lot of clubs."
