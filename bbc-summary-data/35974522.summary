Evans had won a record 10 successive titles before Hong Kong's Ng, 25, beat her in the semi-finals in 2015.
The 30-year-old's win at the Northern Snooker Centre in Leeds will likely secure an invite to qualifying for next year's men's World Championship.
"I'm over the moon and glad to win the title back," she said.
"There was more pressure on Ng this year as defending champion. I struggled a bit but I stuck in there."
Last year, Evans lost 10-8 to 1997 world champion Ken Doherty in the first qualifying round for the World Championship, as she looked to become the first woman to reach the main draw.
Ng will this week face Peter Lines in her opening-round qualifier at Ponds Forge in Sheffield.
