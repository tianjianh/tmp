Andrew Hennells, 32, posted a comment on his profile that read "Doing. Tesco. Over" at 19:25 GMT on 13 February.
Norwich Crown Court heard that just 15 minutes later police caught Hennells with a knife and Â£410 stolen from the store in the Gaywood area of King's Lynn, Norfolk.
"It was a bizarre and unusual case," said Sgt Pete Jessop.
A member of the public had reported seeing a man with a knife demanding cash from a member of staff at the Tesco on St Faith's Drive.
Hennells stole a car from a retired couple who had stopped to use a cash machine and then fled to a nearby pub.
Sgt Jessop said Hennells's Facebook confession had made it easier to secure a guilty plea, which was entered in March.
"The pictures and posts on Facebook helped us confirm what we already knew," said the police officer.
"None of this takes away from the seriousness of the crime or the trauma experienced by the victims."
Judge Anthony Bate, sentencing, said Hennells posed a "high risk of serious harm to the public".
Hennells, of Riverview Way, Gaywood, Norfolk, will spend four years on extended licence after his release from jail as part of his sentence.
He also admitted carrying a knife as an offensive weapon.
