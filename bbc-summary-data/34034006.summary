England have regained the Ashes after a 3-2 home victory over Australia.

The contest featured some moments of individual brilliance from both sides, but also some dire displays, especially with the bat.
England spinner turned BBC Test Match Special pundit Graeme Swann gives his series player ratings.
Matches: 5; Runs: 330; Average: 36.66
Swann: "His captaincy has been spot on, aside from the ludicrous decision to bowl first at The Oval. Without scoring heavily over the series, he looks to be getting back to somewhere near his best form."
Matches: 5; Runs: 115; Average: 12.77
Swann: "He has caught well at slip but has failed to grasp the opportunity to secure the opening berth alongside Cook."
Matches: 5; Runs: 215; Average: 26.87
Swann: "A very disappointing series by his standards. His catching has improved in the slips since the New Zealand series but he needs to score heavily in the UAE to convince himself and others that he still has a long future in the team."
Matches: 5; Runs: 460; Average: 57.50; Wickets: 4; Average: 33.75
Swann: "Exceptional. His hundreds at Cardiff and Trent Bridge were scored at times when his team needed them the most and he probably did more than any other player to help England regain the Ashes. He has gone from Test-class to world-class this summer."
Matches: 3; Runs: 118; Average: 29.50
Swann: "Played well at Trent Bridge and should be nailed on to bat at five through the winter. He was dismissed a couple of times by the short ball, although both were against the quickest bowler in the world."
Matches: 5; Runs: 201; Average: 25.12; Wickets: 11; Average: 33.45
Swann: "Mercurial with both bat and ball but England's best all-rounder since Andrew Flintoff. Magnificent bowling at Trent Bridge and the best catch I've ever witnessed."
Matches: 5; Runs: 122; Average: 15.25; Dismissals: 12
Swann: "Has been solid with the gloves all series, but worryingly short of runs, particularly against the finger spin of Nathan Lyon. Will need to iron out these shortfalls before the turning pitches of the UAE are thrust upon him."
Matches: 5; Runs: 293; Average: 36.62; Wickets: 12; Average: 45.50
Swann: "A hit-and-miss series for Moeen. His runs have at times proved vital down the order, not least at Edgbaston, and he must be the best number eight batsman England have ever had. However, his bowling is short on confidence and as a result he hasn't bowled the overs or taken the wickets that his talent is capable of."
Matches: 5; Runs: 134; Average: 19.14; Wickets: 21; Average: 20.90
Swann: "Started the series strongly without a great deal of reward. England's best bowler in a disappointing affair at Lord's and bowled the greatest Ashes spell in living memory to effectively win the Ashes on day one at Trent Bridge."
Matches: 4; Runs: 103; Average: 25.75; Wickets: 10; Average: 39.10
Swann: "Bags of talent. Has shown good control with the ball all summer without taking devastating amounts of wickets and produced some very useful cameos down the order. An extra mark for being both a Newcastle fan and one carrot short of a salad."
Matches: 3; Runs: 9; Average: N/A; Wickets: 12; Average: 22.50
Swann: "Brilliant return to Test cricket for Steven Finn. Would have got a higher mark if he hadn't kept taking wickets off no-balls."
Matches: 3; Runs: 11; Average: 2.75; Wickets: 10; Average: 27.50
Swann: "Proved himself in helpful conditions to be the best swing bowler in the world and joined the 400 club before injury ended his series. Best John Terry impression at Trent Bridge when he donned his kit for the celebrations."
Matches: 5; Runs: 418; Average: 46.44
Swann: "Has been one of the more successful Australia batsmen but played the worst shot of the Ashes at Lord's to throw away a hundred. Seems to be playing with a bit more responsibility, which should bode well for his future."
Matches: 5; Runs: 480; Average: 60.00
Swann: "Australia's most reliable player, he usually got them off to a half-decent start. He has had a short but highly successful career as an opener and will be hard to replace."
Matches: 5; Runs: 508; Average: 56.44; Wickets: 1; Average: 16.00
Swann: "Excellent knocks in two Australia victories but technically found seriously wanting against the swinging and seaming ball at Cardiff, Edgbaston and Trent Bridge. He is not a number three and needs to move back to number four or five."
Matches: 5; Runs: 132; Average: 16.50
Swann: "I'm being generous because of his exceptional career. A fairly disastrous series with the bat and had to watch his team fail to win the Ashes in England - again. Sad to see him go."
Matches: 5; Runs: 201; Average: 28.71
Swann: "Got better and better as the series went on, but unable to play the Steve Waugh role in the frequent Aussie collapses."
Matches: 3; Runs: 48; Average: 12; Wickets: 8; Average: 18.62
Swann: "With the ball, he looks a find. With the bat, he looks to be two places too high in the order."
Matches: 4; Runs: 143; Average: 23.83; Dismissals: 17
Swann: "Has looked fairly solid with bat and gloves but doesn't look like the fulcrum which Brad Haddin was for the team to pivot around."
Matches: 5; Runs: 141; Average: 17.62; Wickets: 15; Average: 34.93
Swann: "Breathtaking spell at Lord's but unable to match the stratospheric heights of his previous Ashes campaign. Has accepted the Barmy Army banter in seemingly good spirits."
Matches: 5; Runs: 157; Average: 22.42; Wickets: 18; Average: 30.50
Swann: "Despite being their leading wicket-taker he hasn't bowled with anywhere near the control that he shows with the white Kookaburra ball. Definitely a big name for the future but seems strangely rough around the edges."
Matches: 4; Runs: 45; Average: 15.00; Wickets: 16; Average: 25.75
Swann: "The biggest mystery of the Australia team. I expected him to enjoy the Duke ball and the English pitches but couldn't come to terms with either. His performances were put into context by the excellent Peter Siddle at The Oval."
Matches: 5; Runs: 47; Average: 11.75; Wickets: 18; Average: 28.25
Swann: "The most consistent of the Australia bowlers without ever looking like winning a Test on his own. Two beauties bowled through the gate at The Oval, but the pitches were generally unhelpful."
Matches: 1; Runs: 1; Average: 1; Wickets: 6; Average: 11.16
Swann: "Thank heavens he didn't play at Trent Bridge or Edgbaston. Bowled like a dream at The Oval on a featherbed wicket."
Graeme Swann was speaking to BBC Sport's Sam Sheringham.
