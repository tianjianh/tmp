The 'golden age' of disability arts

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A group of experts from the National Disability Arts Collection and Archive (NDACA) has been photographing examples of work from the "golden age" of disability arts.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The disability arts movement began in the 1980s and culminated in the introduction of disability rights legislation in 1995, lasting a few years beyond. During this time, disabled people expressed their frustration in pictures, sculpture and ephemera, in what some call protest art. The aim of the million pound project, funded by the Heritage Lottery Fund, is to capture as much of this collection as possible before it is lost.
Here is a selection of images from the collection.
For more information go to the website of The National Disability Arts Collection and Archive (NDACA) who will be doing more roadshows next year. The collection will be on display from 2017 online, in pop-up galleries, in a national cinema tour, and more.
