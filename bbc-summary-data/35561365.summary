[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man accused of beating a pensioner to death with a marble rolling pin has told a court he was "set up" by police.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Georgina Edmonds, 77, was found dead at her home near Eastleigh, Hampshire, in 2008.
A conversation between Matthew Hamlen and his mother was secretly recorded by police while he was in custody, his trial at Winchester Crown Court heard.
It is alleged he tried to get her to find him an alibi through a false entry in a friend's diary.
Mr Hamlen, from Bishopstoke, is accused of torturing Mrs Edmonds for her bank pin number. He denies her murder.
The prosecution claims DNA and telephone evidence places him at the scene, but he has repeatedly denied the killing.
There was a heated exchange in the courtroom as Mr Hamlen faced a string of accusations in relation to the recorded conversation with his mother.
Prosecutor Michael Bowes QC said: "There's only one reason why your DNA was on Georgina Edmonds' blouse and on the rolling pin, that's because you killed her didn't you?"
"No I didn't," Mr Hamlen replied.
Mr Bowes said: "You tried to use your mother to make a false alibi, with the false diary entry didn't you?"
"I didn't use my mother, no," Mr Hamlen said.
He later added: "If you hadn't sneakily recorded a conversation between me and my mum and tried to set me up....this never would have come out.
"I did not do this."
Mr Bowes said: "You got caught out in a lie, didn't you?"
"I didn't get caught out at all," Mr Hamlen replied.
"What you've been trying to do throughout is to conceal your true behaviour," Mr Bowes said.
"I thought the police were lying to me...I asked them 27 times, explain this to me," Mr Hamlen said.
Mr Bowes replied: "There's only one person who's lying Mr Hamlen, and that's you. No further questions."
The 36-year-old is on trial for murder for a second time after being acquitted of the same crime in 2012.
The trial continues.
