[SN]TITLE[SN]
Barcelona 3-1 Atletico Madrid

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A Lionel Messi-inspired Barcelona remain a point behind La Liga leaders Real Madrid after easing the pressure on boss Luis Enrique with a win over champions Atletico.

A dominant Barcelona took the lead when Luis Suarez and Messi combined for Neymar to convert from close range.
Messi played Suarez in to double the lead before adding a late third.
Mario Mandzukic had pulled a goal back from the penalty spot after Messi fouled Jesus Gamez.
But, despite an improved second-half display and the introduction of Fernando Torres, Atletico were limited to just one shot on target from open play.
At the end of a week which saw him dropped to the bench, skip a public training session due to a mystery 'illness' and encourage speculation over a transfer amid reports of a bitter falling-out with his manager, all eyes were on Messi - even more than ever - on Sunday night.
But was he in the right frame of mind to break the shackles of Atletico's magnificent defence, which had stifled Real Madrid just five days earlier and conceded only two goals in six meetings with Barca last season? It was time to find out.
The Argentine was more or less a conventional right winger, adhering to the 4-3-3 shape of his team with a far more disciplined and less flexible performance than usual.
The fact that Messi - and Neymar on the left - were often found hugging the touchlines appeared to be a strategy devised by Enrique to create space and prevent Atletico maintaining their usual compact, narrow shape in defence.
As the game went on, Messi gradually drifted more regularly into a central position, and it was from there that he scored; dribbling into the penalty area, exchanging passes with Ivan Rakitic and reacting quickest to a deflection to stab home.
Whether playing Messi on the right is a long-term strategy or was just for this specific game remains to be seen. And it's uncertain whether Messi would accept a more prolonged stint as a winger. But on this occasion, it worked a treat.
Unlike last season's six games against Atletico - and even many of his performances this term - in which he drifted in and out of the action, on Sunday night Messi was involved in everything.
He had the first chance, created the opener before laying on another chance for Jordi Alba, started the move which led to a great headed opportunity for Neymar, had a narrow-angled shot blocked, teed up the second goal for Luis Suarez and sent a glancing header narrowly wide. And that was just the first half.
Although Neymar also produced some dazzling moments, Suarez worked devilishly hard and Rakitic dominated the midfield, Messi was without any doubt the key man.
Bad news for Chelsea, Manchester City and Manchester United fans - any thoughts that Messi might be lacking in commitment to the Barca cause and contemplating a change in scenery were completely dispelled by this performance.
Throughout the encounter he worked tirelessly in his unfamiliar position and his mental engagement was clear from his delighted celebration with Neymar after the opening goal, and then again following his own late strike.
Another sign of his positive, highly-motivated attitude was the fact he was back in a defensive position to make the challenge on Gamez which harshly resulted in Atletico's penalty. Messi has been criticised this season for failing to provide protection for right-back Dani Alves, but that was not the case on Sunday.
On this showing, the prospect of him leaving the Nou Camp looks remote indeed.
Throughout the evening - from the moment his name received the loudest ovation when the teams were announced, to the euphoric response to his goal - one thing was made abundantly clear: Messi is the undisputed King of the Nou Camp.
Barca's fans were desperate for him to do well, producing a sharp collective intake of breath in anticipation every time he received possession and volubly leaping to his defence every time he was felled by a hefty Atletico challenge, which was often.
By the end, the fans were putty in his hands, greeting his goal with yet another hearty rendition of the ubiquitous 'Messi, Messi, Messi' chant.
The local media was similarly smitten, with an editorial in Sport urging: "Don't ever leave Messi!" while Mundo Deportivo hailed Barca's "Pure Dynamite".
Enrique was less emphatic, again refusing to comment directly upon the controversies of the past week and noting ruefully that the tension will return as soon as his team suffer a bad result.
The usually media-shy Messi, however, took the unusual step of giving an interview to Barca's in-house TV channel, during which he belatedly claimed that he had never threatened to leave and never asked for Enrique to be sacked, giving the impression of the perfect picture of happiness as he beamed in front of the cameras.
Messi's performance provided the gleaming centre-piece to an outstanding all-round team display from Barca, and on the evidence of this game it is hard to believe there might be such bitter divisions within the camp or any doubt over the Argentine's future.
But the caveat is whether the much-improved performance came because of the manager or despite him.
Was Enrique somehow able to finish such a turbulent week by cajoling a dynamic display of commitment, drive and discipline out of a team which supposedly wants him sacked, or are the players now in charge of the dressing room? Was Messi so motivated because he has decisively won his power struggle with Enrique?
At this stage we do not know - Enrique bristled and angrily evaded the question when it was put to him post-match - and it is perhaps unfair on the victorious manager to even make the suggestion.
But with the soap opera that is FC Barcelona, one thing is certain: this saga is by no means over.
For now, though, Messi can escape to Zurich for Monday's Ballon d'Or ceremony.
As a haven of neutrality, it would not be amiss if he could bring a bit of Switzerland to back to Barcelona.
