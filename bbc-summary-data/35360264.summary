A man posing as a police officer has targeted schoolgirls in north London in a series of incidents the Met is treating as attempted abductions.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Three girls aged 11 to 14 said they were approached in Hornsey by a black man in his 20s who tried to convince them he was a policeman on 18 January.
A fourth girl was approached in a second incident just before 08:00 GMT on 19 January.
The Met said they had spoken to the girls and schools had been informed.
Patrols have been stepped up in the area, it said.
The man was not wearing a police uniform at the time, but it is understood he identified himself as a police officer.
He was described as being of a medium build with short dark hair and wearing a jacket with the hood up.
Ch Insp Jude Beehag-Fisher said: "It would be unusual for police officers in plain clothes not to identify themselves by showing a warrant card, and members of the public are entitled to ask to see one."
