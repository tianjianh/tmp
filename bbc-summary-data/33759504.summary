About 50 of the posts will be created at its offices in Edinburgh and Glasgow, with the rest spread between sites in Leeds, Manchester and London.
The company said it was hiring IT professionals and graduates in response to strong demand for its services.
The new roles will bring the company's total headcount to more than 850.
The posts will include programme and project managers, IT infrastructure technical consultants and IT security specialists.
Group chief executive Paul Thomson said: "We are seeing unprecedented demand from FTSE 100 companies, and equivalent companies internationally, for our IT transformation services and are staffing up accordingly to meet anticipated demand.
"Growth is particularly robust in IT security, where we are running Security Operations Centres for a number of customers.
"We expect revenues from this sector alone to double this financial year."
ECS's client base includes blue-chip companies in banking, financial services, retail and telecoms and media. Its clients include three of the four largest UK retail banks and two of the top four British supermarkets.
