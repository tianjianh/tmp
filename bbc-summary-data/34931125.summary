The fire broke out at the Waverley Hotel, which is owned by Stagecoach tycoon Ann Gloag, on 17 November.
The hotel was empty at the time and no-one was hurt. It is understood damage was caused to all three floors of the main building and the roof.
It took firefighters more than four hours to bring the blaze under control. Eight appliances were used.
The fire service said it would be carrying out an investigation to establish the cause of the fire.
Ms Gloag bought the former hotel in 2011 and is hoping to develop the site with a gym and church hall.
The Waverley Hotel is a listed building and plans to demolish it have been met with objections.
On 23 October, Historic Environment Scotland - which advised Perth and Kinross Council on whether to grant the application for the hotel's demolition - said there were "a number of issues", with the case for demolition to be considered before the council comes to a decision.
