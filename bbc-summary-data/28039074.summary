City have paid a six-figure fee for the 22-year-old forward, who scored 16 goals in 120 appearances for Boro.
Stevenage, who finished bottom of League One last season, had considered selling ex-Arsenal trainee Freeman in January after he attracted interest from Championship sides.
In May, the club activated a 12-month extension to his deal, to keep him under contract until next summer.
"The enthusiasm to do well made me come here, as well as the enthusiasm from Steve Cotterill," Freeman told BBC Radio Bristol.
"Like any footballer, I want to play at the highest level I can. I believe Bristol City have the right attributes to go up and I'm really happy to be here."
City manager Cotterill added: "He's someone we've been keeping tabs on for some time and I'm delighted we've been able to bring Luke on board.
"I've wanted to add a left-sided player to the squad and Luke can actually play in a variety of positions. He can play on the left, on the right and cut in, or play in a midfield three.
"In truth, it's probably going to take six to 12 months to work out his best position, but that'll come by working with him in training.
"He's a good, young, exciting player. He's an excellent addition to the football club for the short term and long term."
Freeman spent his youth career with Charlton and Gillingham before signing for Arsenal in 2008.
He gained Football League experience with Yeovil and Stevenage, who made his loan spell permanent in January 2012.
