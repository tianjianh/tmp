[SN]TITLE[SN]
Surgeon Ian Paterson denies operations were for financial gain

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A surgeon has denied he carried out "completely unnecessary" operations for financial gain.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Breast surgeon Ian Paterson is accused of causing wounding with intent to nine women and one man at two West Midlands hospitals.
It is alleged he exaggerated or invented cancer risks and claimed payments for more expensive procedures in some cases.
But the 59-year-old described the allegations as "abhorrent".

His statement from a police interview in January 2013 was read to jurors at Nottingham Crown Court by prosecutor Nicholas Barraclough.
He said: "He has never pressured any patient to undergo surgery. He gave patients time to make their decision.
"All surgical procedures taken by him were appropriate and necessary and he denies any allegations of unnecessary surgery or bad faith."
Mr Paterson, from Altrincham, Greater Manchester, worked at hospitals run by the Heart of England NHS Trust and Spire Healthcare.
He was asked about an apparent "unjustified" mastectomy he carried out on GP Rosemary Platt in 1997.
The prosecution has previously alleged there was no evidence of abnormal cells in her milk glands, something the father-of-three denies.
Giving evidence, Mr Paterson said Dr Platt's medical background "massively" had an effect on how he treated her, and his actions were justified.
"We all do our best to treat every patient the same, but it's impossible to treat a doctor colleague the same as another lady of the same age and intelligence or whatever," he said.
"Because she brings to the table medical knowledge and, with that medical knowledge, preconceptions - some of which are wrong - and these preconceptions may actually be throwbacks to what she learnt at medical school.
"It can be a challenge to treat a colleague; it's a privilege to treat a colleague because they have chosen you."
The trial continues.
