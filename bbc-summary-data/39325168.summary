She and her partner were walking with their three children - one of them a baby in a pram - when the VW Beetle hit them before crashing into a cafe.
The dad suffered a serious head injury in the crash, in Upper Lake, Battle. The children and female driver were treated for shock and minor injuries.
Customers were trapped inside the cafe after Sunday afternoon's crash, but there were no reported injuries.
The 37-year-old mother died in hospital earlier, Sussex Police said.
The road was shut for several hours but has since reopened.
Sgt Dan Pitcher said: "We are now keen to talk to anyone who may have seen what happened or noticed the black VW being driven shortly beforehand."
