[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Elliott Durrell's late winner helped Chester end their slump in the National League with victory at Bromley.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Both sides struggled to contend with the blustery conditions at Hayes Lane and it showed with Lucas Dawson's 36th-minute effort from 25 yards the best chance of the first half.
Bromley forward Tobi Sho-Silva saw an effort cleared off the line by Sam Hughes at the start of the second half as the game began to liven up.
Hughes then crossed for Evan Horwood but the Chester defender could only strike into the side-netting.
Bromley's best chance came when Louis Dennis was denied by a superb save from Alex Lynch, before Durrell's 25-yard effort on 88 minutes saw Chester end their three-game losing run and pick up only their third win of 2017.
