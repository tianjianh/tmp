Winger Burke, 19, has joined German side RB Leipzig for a fee in the region of Â£13m.
The move, which makes Burke the most expensive Scottish player ever, has angered some Forest fans.
"This money will be used and reinvested back into the squad," Al-Hasawi wrote on Twitter.
Al-Hasawi also pointed out that Forest previously bought Michail Antonio, who is now at West Ham and has been called up by England, and Britt Assombalonga after selling Jamaal Lascelles and Karl Darlow to Newcastle.
Burke, who had been linked with several clubs, signed a five-year contract with Leipzig.
He scored for Forest in the 3-1 victory over Leeds United on Saturday - his fourth goal of the season.
Leipzig sporting director Ralf Rangnick told his club's website: "He is an outstanding talent with an awful lot of potential.
"He fits with the high pace and way of playing very well and will make his next sporting development step with us.
"This transfer is important, especially because several top clubs were interested."
