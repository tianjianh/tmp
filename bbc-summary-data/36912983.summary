Richard Silverwood: Super League referee calls time on career

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Super League's longest-serving match official Richard Silverwood has called time on his refereeing career.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
He was suspended by the Rugby Football League in June pending an investigation and has not taken charge of a game since Magic Weekend in May.
It was his third suspension, having been stopped from officiating in 2009, and again in 2011.
The 40-year-old refereed more than 400 Super League games and the 2013 World Cup final during his 15-year career.
RFL chief operating officer Ralph Rimmer said: "We would like to thank Richard for his contribution as a referee at the sports highest level over the past decade and a half."
Silverwood added: "I have had an outstanding career as a referee. I have no regrets but I am now looking to the next chapter of my career."
Silverwood became Super League's youngest official when he took charge of his first game, between Salford and Halifax, in 2001 at the age of 24.
He was suspended in 2009 following an alleged leak of confidential information to a trade union, while his 2011 disciplinary procedure resulted from an "off-field incident" during a game between Huddersfield and Leeds.
