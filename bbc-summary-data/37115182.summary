A lifeboat crew was called to help the 13-year-old boy who was stranded on the pontoon off Portsmouth Harbour at about 20:30 BST on Wednesday.
The crew said it found the "exhausted" boy curled up, unresponsive to the shine of a spot lamp or their calls.
He was taken to paramedics on the shore and treated after he showed signs of the onset of hypothermia.
It is believed the boy had been swimming from a pier near Portchester sailing club with a group of friends at about 17:00 BST. His friends had left with only one remaining to call for assistance, the RNLI said.
The charity urged people to use its Respect the Water campaign which aims to halve the rate of drownings by 2024.
