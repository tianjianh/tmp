[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The fire at Sixfields Tavern in Northampton began at about 14:30 GMT, half an hour before kick-off between The Cobblers and Northwich.
Northamptonshire Fire and Rescue Service had about 40 firefighters on the scene.
Fans in the Sixfields Stadium posted images on social media of the fire, which was visible from the stands.
It is understood the pub, which is part of the Sixfields Leisure site of restaurants and a cinema, is at least partially destroyed.
No-one was injured.
The fire service was supported by crews from Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire and said the fire was difficult to extinguish due to strong winds, with smoke being blown across the leisure park.
The FA Cup second round tie was not called off and ended with a 3-2 win for Northampton Town, who had trailed their non-league opposition 2-0.
The club advised supporters to follow the advice of police while leaving the ground.
Roads were closed and people were advised to avoid the area.
