Peter Shickle, 58, was found in a pool of blood in his flat in Stevenage, Hertfordshire in 2016. He later died.
His TV was ripped from the wall and wielded in an attack against the father-of-two, Luton Crown Court heard.
John Jamieson, 36, of Wigram Way, Stevenage and Graham King, also 36, of Harrow Court, Stevenage, have denied murdering Mr Shickle.
Mr Shickle was found by a friend at the flat in Silam Road, Stevenage.
Prosecutor Martin Mulgrew said: "His rib cage had been smashed where he had been stamped on. There was also internal bleeding and a bleed on his brain. The cumulative effect was to result in Peter Shickle's death."
He told the jury the head injuries had been caused by the TV hitting Mr Shickle's head.
Mr Mulgrew said the catalyst for the attack happened about a week earlier on 28 October.
He said: "Mr Shickle was out drinking with Christine Jamieson, the mother of the first defendant.
"They were in the Old Post Office pub in Stevenage. During the evening, they got into an argument and a physical altercation took place.
"The crown say this is the spark of events that would lead to the death of Peter Shickle on 6 November.
"The news got back to John Jamieson, Ms Jamieson's son. He set out looking for Peter Shickle."
When questioned by police, Mr Jamieson denied visiting Mr Shickle's home that afternoon. He said he and Mr King had been drinking in Monkswood.
Mr King refused to answer police questions.
The trial continues.
