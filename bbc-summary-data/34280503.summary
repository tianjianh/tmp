He presented the Sunday Morning Gardening Show for 22 years and had been the station's on-air gardening expert for more than 40.
His co-presenter Tim Crowther said he was "absolutely devastated" at his death.
The radio station will open a book of condolence on Monday at its studios.
Mr Crowther described his friend as a brilliant horticulturalist and broadcaster.
"Joe will be deeply missed by me, by my production team, by all his colleagues at BBC Radio Leeds and by our listeners.
"He has left a hole in all our hearts which is impossible to fill," he said.
BBC Radio Leeds editor Rozina Breen said: "Words cannot adequately describe how we feel about losing Joe.
"He was the cornerstone of BBC Radio Leeds, a wonderful man and a first class horticulturist whose enduring patience, kindness and enthusiasm we will miss so much."
Colleagues and listeners have paid tribute to him on social media.
As well as his radio work, Mr Maiden appeared on television and wrote a number of books and articles for magazines.
He is survived by a wife, two children and three grandchildren.
