[SN]TITLE[SN]
M5 in Gloucestershire reopens after lorry fire

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The M5 has reopened after being closed overnight following a lorry fire.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The motorway was shut in both directions between Stroud and Thornbury after the lorry, carrying hay bales, caught fire before midday on Sunday.
The southbound carriageway was closed during the night to resurface part of the carriageway and fix the safety barriers.
Highways England says it took several hours to recover the vehicle before staff could begin the repairs.
