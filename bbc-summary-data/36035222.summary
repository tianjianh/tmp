County Championship: Northamptonshire v Sussex ends as draw

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
No play was possible on day four of the Division Two game between Northamptonshire and Sussex, which ended as a draw.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The decision to call the match off was taken just before 10:00 BST on Wednesday after heavy overnight rain.
The abandonment left Northants opener Ben Duckett stranded on 282 not out, 49 short of the county's record score.
Northants took nine points from their opening Championship fixture of 2016, with Sussex claiming six.
