He sealed victory with four balls to spare after Jason Roy (55 off 36) and Alex Hales (44 off 36) led England's pursuit of 170 at the Wankhede Stadium.
Earlier, Adil Rashid took 3-15 to limit New Zealand to 169-8.
In Chennai, England women claimed a second win in two warm-up games, a 20-run victory over New Zealand.
Jenny Gunn took 4-12 and Heather Knight 3-13 to help bowl New Zealand out for 106, after Tamsin Beaumont's 56 carried England to 126.
South Africa's men amassed 196-8 as they beat India by four runs in a high-scoring warm-up match in Mumbai.
England's spinners were central to a tense victory, checking New Zealand's momentum after they raced to 84-1 inside eight overs.
Off-spinner Moeen Ali removed Henry Nicholls before leg-spinner Rashid claimed three wickets in as many overs, including Kane Williamson for 63 off 39 balls.
"We look to win every game, whether it's a warm-up or not," said Rashid. "We always want to play at 100% and this was a good workout."
Although Roy and Hales added a rapid 77 for the first England wicket, they were left needing 30 off the final three overs - and 20 off the last two after Eoin Morgan fell for 20 chasing a third successive boundary.
Buttler responded by hitting a six and Ben Stokes a four in a Trent Boult over that cost 14, before Buttler drove Tim Southee down the ground to complete victory.
New Zealand all-rounder Mitchell Santner, who took 2-24, said: "England play that aggressive brand of cricket and that will do them well in this tournament."
England men face the Mumbai Cricket Association at the Brabourne Stadium on 14 March, before their first competitive match against West Indies at the Wankhede two days later.
The women's side play South Africa in their final warm-up game in Chennai on 14 March in Chennai, and open their campaign against Bangladesh on 17 March.
