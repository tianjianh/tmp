[SN]TITLE[SN]
Oxford special needs teacher banned after hair-dryer attack on husband

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A special needs teacher jailed for assaulting her husband with a hair-dryer, causing a head injury, has been banned from the profession for life.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Meena Chivers, who worked at Fitzharry's School in Abingdon, was jailed for 16 months last year for causing grievous bodily harm.
A panel ruled the assaults were not in keeping with "the professional conduct of teachers' standards".
The 42-year-old has been banned from teaching indefinitely.
Her trial at Swindon Crown Court heard the attacks on her husband followed years of physical and mental abuse for which she showed no remorse.
The professional hearing, carried out by the National College for Teaching and Leadership (NCTL), found Chivers's actions, which took place in the presence of a child, "undermined fundamental British values".
The panel also said her behaviours showed "a deep-seated attitude that leads to harmful behaviour".
The prohibition order prevents her from teaching in any school, sixth form college, relevant youth accommodation or children's home in England indefinitely.
She cannot apply for the order to be lifted.
