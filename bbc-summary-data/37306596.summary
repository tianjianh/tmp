[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A shoplifter has been jailed for 75 days after she asked a sheriff to scrap her community service order and send her to prison instead.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Sonya Macdonald, 25, from Crieff, was originally given a non-custodial sentence for stealing from a TK Maxx store in Perth on 19 November 2014.
She returned to court to ask for a jail term after relapsing into drug use.
Sheriff Lindsay Foulis said: "In light of the position stated, I will grant your wish and revoke the order."
Macdonald's solicitor Paul Parker-Smith had told the court: "She is asking the court to revoke the order and impose a custodial sentence instead.
"She has relapsed into drug misuse and much to her credit she contacted my office to say she was finding it hard to cope with the order.
"She is concerned she may, without appropriate assistance, revert to her old ways and she does not want to do that. Her request is to revoke the order and impose the alternative appropriate sentence."
Macdonald was previously placed on a curfew for six months after stealing wallets from men while she kissed them in a nightclub.
She was also jailed for five months in January 2015 after mugging a woman at a cash machine 10 minutes after being freed on bail.
