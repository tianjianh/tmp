Both victims were working at McDonagh's pharmacy on the Falls Road when a man entered with a knife.
The man threatened two staff members before attacking them.
The first victim, in his 40s, was stabbed in the arm and the second, a man in his 50s, sustained a stab wound to his chest.
At this time their injuries are not believed to be life-threatening.
It is understood staff at the pharmacy tackled the attacker and kept him there until police arrived.
A 26-year-old man was arrested at the scene. He also sustained stab wounds to his lower back.
Sinn FÃ©in councillor Steven Corr said there was a sense of "anger and disgust" in the community after the attack.
The chairman of the Pharmacy Forum in Northern Ireland, Sheelin McKeagney, says security in pharmacies will be reviewed.
"It would be very sad if we have to get to the point where we have to have security guards in pharmacies and hopefully this will be a one-off incident.
"However, we will be addressing security issues with the Department of Health, and with the PSNI, to see how we can assist our colleagues prevent these sorts of attacks from happening."
The police have appealed for witnesses.
