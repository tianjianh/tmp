The ship's visitor route at the Portsmouth Historic Dockyard has expanded by 80%, with access to the Poop Deck and carpenter's store.
Prof Dominic Tweddle, director general of the Royal Navy museum, said it would be seen "in a completely new light".
The ship, which is undergoing a 13-year Â£35m conservation, featured in the Battle of Trafalgar in 1805.
Nelson was injured during the battle and later died aboard the ship.
Andrew Baines, head of historic ships at the museum, said: "This is the most exciting transformation of one of the world's most iconic ships in nearly a century.
"The idea is to show visitors the ship as Nelson would have seen her, as part of an exciting new journey around his flagship."
Prof Tweddle added: "Victory is iconic and it is very much cherished by the thousands who visit her every year.
"Visitors will get to experience her anew, and see all of the wonderful areas of the ship that could not have been accessed until now."
