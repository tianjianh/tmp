The Belgian defender played 44 games for Thistle after arriving on a free transfer from Lierse in his homeland.
"Thanks to all my team-mates from the past two seasons, I made some friends for life," Frans said in a statement on Twitter.
"And of course the fans... from the first game until the last you supported me. Once a Jag, always a Jag."
