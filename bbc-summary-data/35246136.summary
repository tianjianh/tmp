IndyCamp group faces deadline to respond to legal action

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Independence campaigners who have set up camp outside the Scottish parliament are facing a deadline to respond to legal proceedings against them.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The IndyCamp Live group was served with a notice to quit Holyrood last month, and given 21 days to submit its case to the Court of Session.
Campers aim to stay in place until Scotland is independent.
The group declined to comment on the latest developments, but previously vowed to fight to continue its vigil.
IndyCamp was set up in late November, with campers planning to keep the site occupied full-time until Scottish independence is declared.
Camp leaders said they were taking inspiration from the Democracy for Scotland vigil in the 1990s, which spent five years campaigning for devolution.
However, the Scottish Parliament launched legal action against the group, saying it did not have permission to camp on the site and was preventing other members of the public from using the public space.
A spokesman said the presence of the group was "at odds with the policy of maintaining the political neutrality of the parliamentary estate".
Notice was served on the campers on 8 December, giving them 48 hours to leave the site. After this time elapsed, the parliament petitioned the Court of Session to "recover possession" of the land occupied by the camp.
The court gave permission for parliament to serve action on the campers, but the group was given 21 days to respond to the petition, expiring on Thursday.
The group declined to comment on how it would respond to the legal proceedings, but has maintained throughout its vigil that it intended to remain in place.
