The names will be honoured with plaques across the city as part of Hull hosting the City of Culture arts festival.
Plaques already unveiled feature the city's first female doctor and two men who sailed on Captain Scott's first journey to Antarctica.
Others include four women who campaigned for improved safety in the fishing industry in the 1970s.

The new list of nominees include Trevor Bolder, who will join fellow musician Mick Ronson in getting a plaque. The pair played with David Bowie in the Spiders from Mars in the 1970s.
Film directors Gerald and Ralph Thomas who produced the Carry On and Doctor films are honoured, as well as actor and charity campaigner Brian Rix, who died last year aged 92.
Sporting heroes include rugby league players Clive Sullivan and Roger Millward and former Hull City player and manager Raich Carter.
The world of science is represented by mathematician John Venn, inventor of the Venn diagram, and astrophysicist Edward Milne, former president of the Royal Astronomical Society.
Labour councillor Mary Glew said hosting the City of Culture festival was a significant time to honour "all people who made a difference nationally and internationally".
"We are really proud of these pioneers that made a difference and the Made in Hull theme is further helping to engender pride in people about our history heritage and moving us forward in a really positive way," she said.
The plaques will be unveiled at places connected with the recipients throughout the year.
