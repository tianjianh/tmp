Additional safety checks will be conducted on all 24 of Sheffield's council tower blocks, following the fire at Grenfell Tower in London.

Sheffield City Council said the checks by the fire service were "precautionary" and designed to reassure residents.
The council said these would be in addition to daily inspections carried out in all buildings by housing staff.
Sheffield is the latest local authority to respond to the Grenfell Tower fire.
Fire safety advice to residents of high-rise buildings has already been issued by councils across England.
Leeds City Council has also said it is reviewing fire safety at all the 116 multi-storey buildings it manages.
In Manchester, the council has begun checks on its fire safety procedures and the Mayor of Greater Manchester, Andy Burnham, is due to hold a meeting this week between landlords of high rises and the fire service.
Councillor Jayne Dunn, cabinet member at Sheffield City Council, said she knew people might be concerned following the terrible fire in London.
"I think it would reassure residents to know that the fire service will be conducting a risk assessment of all our tower blocks.
"This is purely precautionary," she said.
"Once we know the reasons for the disaster, if we need to change any arrangements to keep tenants safe then we will," she added.
The council said 21 of its tower blocks had metal cladding which is fire proof as the insulation used is mineral and rock wool, with fire breaks at the floor and party walls.
That creates a fire-proof box around each flat to prevent the spread of fire to other flats.
The other three are brickwork-clad and designed to operate in the same way as the other 21 but have a separate metal fire barrier installed.
The checks are due to begin on Monday.
