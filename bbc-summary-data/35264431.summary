[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A banned drink driver ran over a teenage boy in Dundee, told him it was "your problem, not mine" and then drove off, a court has heard.

Jan Kozlowski admitted causing serious injury to the 15-year-old boy after driving while disqualified.
He is the first person in Scotland to be convicted under new road traffic laws designed to clamp down on banned drivers.
The 40-year-old, a prisoner at HMP Perth, was remanded in custody.
He will be sentenced at a later date.
Dundee Sheriff Court heard that Kozlowski was handed a road ban on 2 June last year after admitting a drink driving offence.
He had previously been convicted of being in charge of a car while drunk.
Kozlowski, a labourer, was back behind the wheel just days later - driving his works van, having failed to tell his employers of his ban.
At 18:20 on 9 July, he was driving on Dundee's Pitkerro Road when he hit the boy who was crossing the road with friends.
Fiscal depute Eilidh Robertson said: "He [the boy] stepped out between parked cars where he was struck by the motor van being driven by the accused.
"The accused did not swerve or sound his horn. He began to brake once hitting the boy and he remained on the bonnet of the van until the van came to a stop and he fell on to the roadway."
The boy's friends helped him onto the pavement before the accused and his brother, a passenger in the van, approached them.
"The accused assisted in helping the boy to his feet but said 'your problem, not mine' before getting back in his vehicle and driving away," Ms Robertson said.
A passer-by called the police and an ambulance.
The teenager - who cannot be named for legal reasons - had a badly broken ankle which could may require further surgery, the court was told.
Defence solicitor Ross Donnelly said he would give his plea in mitigation at a later sentencing date.
Sheriff Tom Hughes deferred sentence until next month for social work background reports.
