Asher-Smith came fourth in her semi-final in 22.49 seconds and progressed as one of two fastest losers but compatriot Jodie Williams came last in her semi in a time of 22.99 seconds.
Dafne Schippers of the Netherlands qualified fastest in 21.96 seconds.
Meanwhile, Eilidh Doyle is through to the 400m hurdles final as a fastest loser with a time of 54.99 seconds.
Doyle told BBC Sport: "Obviously I would have liked to have qualified automatically but I'm actually happy with how the race went.
"My race just showed that it's wide open this year."

Lawrence Clarke and Andrew Pozzi both failed to qualify for the final of the 110m hurdlers while Jack Green came last in his semi-final of the 400m men's hurdles.
Pozzi struggled in his semi, clocking 13.67 seconds before being disqualified, and told BBC Sport: "It was just abysmal. There are no other words to describe it."
Clarke, who finished sixth in his semi in 13:46 seconds, said: "I was in the lane next to the world number one and I just went for it. It just wasn't to be."
Green, 24, came last in his semi-final in a time of 49.54 seconds.
However, it was a better night for Ireland's Thomas Barr, who won his 400m hurdles semi-final in a national record time of 48.39 seconds.
"I couldn't have timed it any better. I can not believe it," he told BBC Sport.
"I felt really good so I was secretly hoping to reach the final. I got my stride pattern spot on."
Jazmin Sawyers and Lorraine Ugen both qualified for the final of the women's long jump but there was disappointment for fellow Briton Shara Proctor.
Ugen jumped 6.65m while Sawyers recorded a leap of 6.53m to reach Thursday's final but Proctor's 6.36m was not enough to see her progress.
Meanwhile, the only Russian athlete permitted to compete in Rio, Darya Klishina, reached the final with a jump of 6.64m.
Klishina, 25, who lives and trains in the United States, initially escaped a blanket ban on Russia's athletes for doping by governing body the IAAF, but her eligibility was revoked following new, but unspecified, information.
However, the Court of Arbitration for Sport overturned that decision.
