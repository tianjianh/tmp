[SN]TITLE[SN]
Coventry City 2-2 Bolton Wanderers

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Max Clayton salvaged a stoppage-time point as Bolton twice came from behind to draw with Coventry at the Ricoh Arena.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
New signing Stuart Beavon looked to have secured Coventry a valuable three points when he fired home in the 69th minute to put the hosts 2-1 ahead.
The diminutive striker - signed from Burton 24 hours before the game - fired home a low shot after a superb run from Ryan Haynes, who ghosted past three defenders before putting Beavon in inside the visitors' area.
But Clayton's late leveller saw Bolton snatch a point to remain in second spot in League One.
Beavon was also involved in Coventry's opening goal in the 37th minute, the experienced forward showing dogged determination to rob defender Mark Beevers of possession and help set up Marcus Tudgay for his 100th career goal.
It was a rare moment of quality in a desperately poor first half but Bolton were far more on their game after the half-time break.
David Wheater headed wide for the visitors on the hour but, five minutes later, they were back in the game when Haynes pulled over striker Gary Madine, allowing substitute Zach Clough to convert from the penalty spot.
Beavon's goal two minutes later appeared to have won it for his new side but Clayton showed a cool head to convert from inside the area right at the end.
