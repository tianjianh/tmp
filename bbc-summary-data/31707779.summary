[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A police misconduct hearing is to be held after a "death by misadventure" verdict at the inquest of a man who died after a search by officers.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Habib Ullah, 39, of Slough, Berkshire, collapsed during a routine stop and search in a car park at High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire, in July 2008.
Thames Valley Police said there was a case of "gross misconduct" to answer.
An Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) investigation has been passed to local police.
The jury returned a narrative verdict at the inquest at Buckinghamshire Coroner's Court in Beaconsfield on Monday.
Thames Valley Police said a misconduct hearing will take place "as soon as possible" into the gross misconduct charge.
A police spokesman said: "This has been a long and distressing process for Habib Ullah's family."
A previous inquest in 2010 was abandoned after it was found key evidence had been removed from statements to the IPCC.
Five Thames Valley Police officers and a solicitor acting for police officers were interviewed by the IPCC under criminal caution.
Mr Ullah was part of a group searched by Thames Valley officers in a car in High Wycombe.
During the search, he suffered breathing problems and later died in hospital.
In an investigation, the IPCC interviewed the officers involved. They were also allowed to submit written statements.
In March 2010, the IPCC cleared the officers of any wrongdoing.
But, under oath at the inquest the following December, the officers admitted removing potentially key evidence from their written statements to the IPCC, claiming they were told to do so by a Police Federation lawyer.
As a result, the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) examined whether criminal charges should be brought and the IPCC re-opened its investigation.
In October, the CPS decided not to proceed with any charges.
The IPCC has passed its finding to Thames Valley Police and Mr Ullah's family. The results will be revealed after the misconduct hearing.
More than 13 vigils have been held by campaigners calling for justice for Mr Ullah.
