The 28-year-old Olympic gold medallist has decided to move on after several successful years at the British team.
"I wanted a change, some new motivation and a different experience," he said.
"I don't think I was getting stale but a fresh way of doing things will just keep me fresh. Maybe I was getting too relaxed. It's exciting times."
Kennaugh, from the Isle of Man, added: "At Sky sometimes it's more of a GC (general classification), conservative style of racing, and I've appreciated that but I'm going to a team that has a different style."
Meanwhile, 25-year-old French rider Warren Barguil, this year's Tour de France King of the Mountains, will race for Rennes-based Fortuneo next season after deciding to leave Sunweb.
