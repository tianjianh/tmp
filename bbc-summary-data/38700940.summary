[SN]TITLE[SN]
Stevenage 2-0 Grimsby Town

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Stevenage kept their first clean sheet in nine games as they overcame Grimsby Town for their first win in three matches.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Steven Schumacher put the home side ahead with a spectacular free-kick on three minutes before Jobi McAnuff grabbed a second on the hour.
While Grimsby began the day on the back of four wins in six games, their out-of-form hosts - who had lost five of their last six League Two matches - struck first.
And it came in some style as Schumacher placed the ball 30 yards out before producing a stunning free-kick that Dean Henderson was powerless to stop.
Omar Bogle passed up two similar set-piece opportunities at the other end, while Matt Godden hit high and wide with Stevenage's next best chance.
Upon the restart, Grimsby pushed and probed for a leveller.
But with 62 minutes on the clock, a mix-up between Henderson and Zak Mills gift-wrapped McAnuff a chance, and he took full advantage with a lobbed finish.
