The former Hearts captain recently left Leeds, having moved to Elland Road last summer despite a trial at Rangers.
"I'm excited to come here from Leeds and on the first day it felt like it was the right decision," Zaliukas told the club's website.
"It's a brilliant stadium and it's going to be fun to play here."
Zaliukas played more than 200 times for Hearts over seven years, but made just 15 appearances for Leeds last term.
His first competitive match for Rangers could be against Hibs in the Challenge Cup on 5 August.
The Ibrox outfit's first Scottish Championship fixture of the campaign is against Hearts at Ibrox on 10 August.
"I think the Championship is going to be a very interesting league because Hearts and Hibs are in here, and even Falkirk and Queen of the South are going to be tough teams," the 30-year-old added.
"I think our squad could compete straight away in the Premiership, everyone is experienced and top players. I think we are going to have a very good squad."
Rangers have also added former St Mirren defender Darren McGregor to their ranks this summer.
