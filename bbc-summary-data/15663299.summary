The soldier, from the 4th Battalion The Yorkshire Regiment, died on Wednesday at Babaji in Helmand province.
He was serving with 1st Battalion The Yorkshire Regiment as a part of a Combined Force in Lashkar Gah.  His next of kin have been informed.
The death of the soldier - the 385th in Afghanistan since 2001 - gives added poignancy to Remembrance Sunday.
Last week Private Matthew Haseldin, 21, of Settle, North Yorkshire, was killed in Afghanistan and during Prime Minister's Question Time David Cameron and Ed Miliband both paid tribute to him.
His body is due to be repatriated on Thursday.
Reacting to Wednesday's death, Lieutenant Colonel Gordon Mackenzie, a spokesman for Task Force Helmand, said: "We are greatly saddened by the news of this soldier's death."
"We will keep him and his loved ones in our thoughts as we carry on with our important mission. His loss is not in vain," he added.
The 4th Battalion The Yorkshire Regiment are based at Worsley Barracks in York.
The death comes in the middle of a row over England's footballers wearing poppies.
On Wednesday Fifa relented and agreed to allow England to wear the poppy symbol on their shirts during Saturday's friendly against Spain.
