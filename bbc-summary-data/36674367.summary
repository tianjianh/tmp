Mousset, 20, joins after a prolific season in Ligue 2 where he scored 14 goals and has also been capped at under-20 level by France.
He was part of the squad which played in last month's Toulon Tournament before losing to England in the final.
"Lys is another player with great potential," Bournemouth chief executive Neill Blake said.
"We're always planning for the future and Lys is not only a young player with exciting potential, but someone who had a massive impact for their club last season."
