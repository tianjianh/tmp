Indian drinks baron Vijay Mallya has tweeted he has "not absconded" from India and will "comply" with the law.

Speculation rose about his whereabouts after a consortium of banks and creditors approached the Supreme Court over $1.4bn (Â£980m) in unpaid debts.
They demanded that his passport be impounded, and a $75m (Â£53m) severance pay he was to receive from Diageo be blocked and used to repay them.
The payout was blocked, but it emerged that Mr Mallya had already left India.
The issue caused an uproar in India with opposition MPs accusing the government of allowing the flamboyant businessman to leave the country.
But Mr Mallya insisted that he "did not flee from India", and also criticised his "media trial" over the issue.
Media reports say Mr Mallya is currently living in London.
Opposition MPs have demanded that the government should bring him back to face the law.
Mr Mallya, who is a household name in India, sold a large chunk of United Spirits, which he inherited from his father, to Diageo in April 2014.
He was to receive the $75m payout as settlement after being ousted from the firm in February.
Mr Mallya, once dubbed by Indian media as "India's Richard Branson" and the "King of Good Times" for his lavish lifestyle also owns a stake in the Formula One team Force India.
