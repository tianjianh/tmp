The two journalists killed by a gunman while broadcasting in Virginia were shot in the head, officials have said.

Both of their causes of death are listed as homicides by the US state's medical examiner's office.
Alison Parker suffered gunshot wounds to the head and chest while Adam Ward died from gunshot wounds to the head and torso.
It is not yet clear how many times Parker and Ward were shot during the attack on Wednesday.
Parker and Ward both worked for WDBJ in Roanoke, Virginia, and were shot while broadcasting by a former employee of their station.
Vester Flanagan later died from self-inflicted gunshot wounds. He had claimed staff had mistreated him during his time there.
During Friday morning's broadcast on WDBJ, anchor Kim McBroom said it was "another tough morning for us, but we're soldiering on".
Two days after the horrifying events, the shopping plaza where the journalists were killed during an on-air interview, Bridgewater Plaza in Moneta, Virginia, is re-opening.
"It's very bittersweet, but we are glad to be back," said one store manager, Lesley Kocsis. She saw the shooting on TV before she came into work and told employees not to bother coming in.
Another shop at the plaza, CJ's Coffee and Sandwich Shop, re-opened on Friday morning as well. Owner Chris Genna said it was an "emotional" day.
Vicki Gardner, who was being interviewed at the time of the attack and was shot in the back after the gunman missed her twice, got up and walked to the ambulance after being hit, said her husband Tim Gardner, speaking to ABC News.
Ms Gardner is now in a "good condition" at a hospital.
"But the surgeon told me that a couple of centimetres and she wouldn't be walking, and a couple of centimetres and she wouldn't be alive," Mr Gardner said.
The BBC talked to Andy Parker, father of slain journalist Alison Parker, about gun control in the US.
He urged President Barack Obama to "work the press" on gun control and that he knew it would be an uphill battle, but he could do it.
"Mr President, you need to do this, you need to tackle this, you can do this, I will help you do this and the press is with you because they just lost one of their own."
Authorities have said that Flanagan legally purchased his weapon.
