A "high demand" for tickets for a free acrobatic event in Hull caused the online booking system to crash, organisers said.

Ten thousand free tickets were released at 10:00 BST for the Places Des Anges event in Queens Gardens on 2 July.
Hull 2017 City of Culture said demand "far exceeded [expectations] and the sheer volume of online traffic caused the server to go down."
A spokesman said all bookings had been suspended until Monday.
The company, which is responsible for organising activities for Hull's City of Culture year in 2017, said: "We are sorry that this happened and for any inconvenience caused.
"One of the reasons for staging this event was to test our systems ahead of 2017.
"No tickets have been issued and we are suspending the process until Monday 6 June at 10am.
"We will be informing people who registered in advance and updating via the Hull 2017 and social media."
The show, which has been created by French company Gratte Ciel, involves aerial acrobatic dancers performing a number of feats above the crowd.
It was previously performed at the London 2012 Festival.
