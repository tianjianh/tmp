The 19-year-old was with a 22-year-old man in Erdington, Birmingham, on Friday night when he was put in the car amid an outbreak of disorder, police said.
Soon after, police were called to nearby Hunton Road, where a dead man was found. They believe he was the man forced into the car.
The 22-year-old was not seriously injured.
Officers were initially called to reports of disorder between two groups of men in The Gardens at about 20:50 BST. They were then called to Hunton Road about five minutes later, a West Midlands Police spokesman said.
Det Insp Warren Hines, from West Midlands Police, said: "It appears there is two people on one side of whatever's gone on and another group of males on the other side of what's gone."
He said one of a possible two vehicles involved in the incident had been recovered - a blue Mercedes, believed to have been rented by the brother of victim.
But he appealed for anyone who saw a silver VW Passat in either area at the time to contact the force.
