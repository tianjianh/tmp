Gareth McAllister, 18, is also accused of inflicting wounds on a 74-year-old man during a triple stabbing in Glengormley, County Antrim.
All three alleged victims are members of the same family.
Mr McAllister, of Rogan Manor in Newtownabbey, was arrested at a nearby petrol station on Wednesday night.
A man aged 20 had suffered a slash wound to his forehead in an alleged attack at the house on the Antrim Road.
His 51-year-old father and his grandfather also sustained cuts as further violence broke out at the nearby garage, according to police.
Mr McAllister appeared before Belfast Magistrates' Court on a total of 10 counts.
He is charged with the attempted murders of Jonathan and John Green, and assault occasioning actual bodily harm to Derek Green.
The other alleged offences include: possessing a bread knife in public; four assaults on police representatives; a separate assault on John Green last Saturday; and criminal damage to his front door.
Mr McAllister spoke only to confirm he understood the charges against him.
Although no further details were disclosed, a detective constable said he could connect the accused to the alleged offences.
A defence lawyer said he was not applying for bail "at this time".
A judge remanded Mr McAllister in custody to appear again by video-link next Thursday.
