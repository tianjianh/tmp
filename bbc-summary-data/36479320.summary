Liverpool Mayor Joe Anderson has promised to order a new Mersey ferry as he launched his manifesto to take charge of the Liverpool City Region.

Mr Anderson made the pledge at Birkenhead's Cammell Laird shipyard, which he hopes will build the vessel.
He is standing as Metro Mayor against Liverpool MPs Luciana Berger and Steve Rotheram for the Labour Party candidate to be chosen later this year.
The date for the Metro Mayor election has been set for 4 May 2017.
Mr Anderson, who won a second term as Liverpool Mayor in May, said he had "the experience and vision" for the role and was committed to "give our world-famous ferries the investment they need".
The new vessel would have "a cleaner, economical design and lower running costs" for Merseytravel, he added.
Mr Anderson also said he was "confident" that Cammell Laird would be able to put together a competitive bid to build the ferry though the firm would have to go through the usual tendering process.
Wirral council leader, Phil Davies, who is backing Mr Anderson for the party's nomination, said he was "delighted" at the announcement.
The Liverpool City Region covers five Merseyside councils - Liverpool, St Helens, Knowsley, Sefton and Wirral - as well as Halton in Cheshire.
In November, all six councils signed a devolution agreement that will give the city region direct control over Â£30m a year in investment for the next three decades.
The Metro Mayor will oversee decisions on four key policy areas - economic development, transport, employment and skills, and planning for development.
