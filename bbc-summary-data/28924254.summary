Police said a 24-year-old man was the victim of a "paramilitary style shooting" in Flax Street on Sunday.
Sinn Féin MLA Carál Ní Chuilín said people in Ardoyne were disgusted that the shooting happened while a community festival was taking place.
"This young man was shot only yards from the entrance to the venue of the Ardoyne Fleadh where thousands of people had gathered," she said.
"This was a cowardly and despicable attack and local people are also horrified that it was carried out in full view of children who were going to the festival.
"The thugs who carried out this attack represent no one.
"They should immediately end their campaign of violence and threats against the people of Ardoyne.
"Anyone who has any information on this attack should bring it to the police."
The man was taken to hospital for treatment. His injuries are not life-threatening.
