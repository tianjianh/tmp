Australia international Christian Lealiifano says there were times during his recovery from leukaemia that he thought he would not play rugby again.

The 29-year-old was diagnosed in August 2016, but made his comeback in the Brumbies' Super Rugby quarter-final loss in July.
Lealiifano has been linked with a short-term deal at Pro14 side Ulster.
"When I first started training I thought I would never play football again," Lealiifano said.
"When the doctor gave me the all clear that I could return back to work, that was when I had my eye on the prize."
Lealiifano said his cancer battle has "changed" his outlook on life.
He underwent chemotherapy and a bone marrow transplant, and was told the cancer was in remission in February.
"I would go through this 10 times again for the person I am today," he said. "The journey I have been through and the person that I have become."
Lealiifano say he is "exploring options" in Australia's National Rugby Championship and playing abroad.
Addressing the Ulster rumours, he said: "Nothing has been locked away yet - it is something in the pipeline."
Lealiifano, who the last of his 19 caps for the Wallabies against England in June 2016, said he is not focusing on a return to the national side.
"I have not really thought too much about it - I will just work through each day and each game," he added.
