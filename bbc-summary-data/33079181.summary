Mali produced a superb performance to beat Ghana 3-0, brushing aside the 2009 champions who had gone into the game as favourites, having beaten Argentina and won Group B.
The Eaglets began strongly and made the breakthrough after 20 minutes when Diadie Samassekou rifled a shot into far corner after exchanging quick passes with Adama Traore.
After the break they doubled their advantage through Diedonne Gbakle, who cut in from the right, beating two men before unleashing a thunderous effort that went in off the underside of the bar.
With nine minutes of the match remaining, Mali wrapped up a glorious victory when Aboubabacar Doumbia sped clear of the Ghana defence and chipped into the corner.
Mali will face either Germany or Nigeria in the quarter-finals.
Senegal booked their place in the last-eight thanks to some heroics from goalkeeper Ibrahima Sy.
The sides were level 1-1 after extra-time - Sidy Sarr scoring on 83 minutes to cancel out Artem Biesiedin's 77th-minute opener - but Senegal romped to a 3-1 in a penalty shoot-out.
Sy, who is on the books of French side L'Orient, saved from Yevhen Chumak, Yevhenii Nemtinov and Valerii Luchevych, while each of Senegal's takers dispatched their kicks.
