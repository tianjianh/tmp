Ms Langmead said her daughter managed to free herself from the toilet seat, thought to have been covered in super-strong glue, but was in tears after the incident which was thought to have been a prank.
A police spokesman said: "Following injuries to a four-year-old girl at the McDonalds in Exeter High Street on New Year's Day, police identified two juvenile girls who were subsequently interviewed by police.
"The two girls immediately accepted what they had done, were sorry and have apologised to the victim's mother for the upset caused to her and her daughter.
"Devon and Cornwall Police have subsequently taken appropriate action against the offenders."
He added that Ms Langmead was "happy with the outcome".
McDonald's previously said staff swiftly offered medical help and contacted police "as soon as our restaurant team was made aware of this incident".
