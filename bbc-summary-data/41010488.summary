Noel Hawkins, of the Scottish Wildlife Trust's Living Seas project, took his footage late last week.
Lion's mane are one of the world's largest known species of jellyfish and "pack a fairly sore sting", said the trust.
The one filmed by Mr Hawkins was about 4.5m (15ft) in length.
The snorkeler said: "Although nasty to the touch, they are quite graceful to see."
The jellyfish can be often seen off Scotland's coast.
