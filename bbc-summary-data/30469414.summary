[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Named locally as Lily Godwin and Abbey Rogers, both were 19 and passengers in the car. They died at the scene in Gosport Lane, Lyndhurst, on Saturday.
The driver, a 21-year-old man and another passenger, a 19-year-old woman, are being treated in hospital. Their injuries are not life-threatening.
The Reverend James Bruce said the village was feeling "profound shock".
After the crash happened, just after midnight, Gosport Lane was closed while police examined the scene.
Mr Bruce, who is the vicar of St. Michael and All Angels Church, asked the women's families be given privacy at this time.
He said residents were experiencing "deep sadness" at the news of the deaths.
He added: "In the church we've set up a table with candles to light if they'd like to do that as a way of expressing their grief.
"Rather strangely I was already billed to be preaching about Jesus being the one who comes to bring comfort to the broken-hearted, not expecting that we would have so many broken-hearted people in the village on this very morning."
Post-mortem examinations have yet to take place.
Hampshire Constabulary appealed for witnesses who saw the car on the night to come forward.
It added: "Next-of-kin are being kept informed and supported by specialist family liaison officers.
"No arrests have been made.
"[We are] grateful for the co-operation of members of the public, firefighters and paramedics during the early stages of the investigation."
