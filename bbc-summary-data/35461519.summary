[SN]TITLE[SN]
Sir Terry Wogan 'was master of the shared joke'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The thing with Wogan was it felt like a club.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
I'm not talking here about the TV Wogan - that's an altogether different person -  but the radio Wogan was definitely in charge of a slightly strange and very, very  British sect - a sort of Akela to a pack of radio-listening, whimsical, ageing cub scouts.
But how do you explain that  to someone who didn't listen or didn't get the jokes?
"I'm not sure what we've lost but it feels like a moment," was one conversation I had with a BBC boss.  I sat there nodding, equally struggling to think past the cliches people write about Wogan.
Then it came to me, PG Wodehouse.  He was president of the PG Wodehouse Society: Jeeves, Bertie Wooster, Gussie Fink-Nottle - all the characters sort of echo the mood of a morning with Wogan.
The emails from Chuffer Dandridge said it all.
Mark Lawson writing in The Guardian mentions the influence of Brian O'Nolan and his books written under the name Flann O'Brien.  The mood is light, silly, surreal but the comedy is deeply clever.
Suddenly it made sense.  The Wogan mood was set fast in an imaginative world created by a childhood steeped in Billy Bunter, Just William, half-remembered Latin, the Goons, Round the Horne and Janet and John books.
The barely broadcast-able rewritings of the now-grown-up Janet and John that so amused him sounded odd and out of place when replayed on other radio programmes.  The joke depended on the atmosphere and, wonderful as the Today Programme is. it struggles with the old fashioned joy of half concealed smut.
The other problem is that Janet and John were on their way out in the 1970s.
Those under 45 might know they were reading books for the under-fives but unless you had actually sat in a dusty classroom wondering what was the point of reading when the stories were so unfathomably dull then I doubt you'd have enjoyed the parodies in quite the same way.
Wogan's radio show was a shared joke based on the sort of shared reference points that binds a nation together.
The passing of Wogan isn't just the passing of a great broadcaster - it creates a feeling that I haven't got a word for.
I don't know if it exists (I bet there's one for it in German) but it's this - that slightly dispiriting deflation when a joke or a reference or even a mood you express is met with blank incomprehension.
Wogan was the master of the shared joke and now there's one less person to share the joke with.
Oh, I think I know what the word is now.
It's feeling old.
