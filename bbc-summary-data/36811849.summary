[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
League One side Bradford City have signed striker Jordy Hiwula on a season-long loan from Huddersfield.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 21-year-old joined Town in the summer of 2015 from Manchester City but made only one substitute appearance for the Terriers in 2015-16.
He had loan spells in the third tier with Wigan and Walsall last term, scoring a total of nine goals.
"I think the way that Bradford play will suit the way I play," Hiwula told the club website.
"I like coming short, getting on the ball and linking up the play, but I also like stretching defences and playing in behind."
