Ryder Cup captain Darren Clarke pulls out of US Open

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Darren Clarke has withdrawn from next week's US Open at Oakmont because of his commitments as Ryder Cup captain and poor form.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The former Open champion from Northern Ireland will lead the European team at Hazeltine in September.
"I'm dedicating all of my time to our Ryder Cup preparations and the US Open is not the place to be when your game isn't 100%," said the 47-year-old.
"I'm very sorry to miss Oakmont but I'm sure it will be a brilliant week."
He added that he will be watching the tournament "very closely".
