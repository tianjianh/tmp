It was due to be held at the Waterfoot Hotel in Londonderry but its owner called the event after voicing concerns about "health and safety".
The dissident republican bomb was discovered in the hotel grounds last Friday.
The session will now take place at St Columb's Park House, on the Limavady Road, Derry on Saturday.
There were also security alerts at two other venues last week where recruitment events were due to take place.
Belfast Met's Millfield campus and Omagh's Strule Arts Centre were evacuated but nothing untoward was found.
