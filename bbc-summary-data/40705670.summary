"Our hearts are broken. The shock waves of grief and denial are still sweeping through our family as we come to grips with what has happened," it read.
"You touched so many lives, maybe even more than you realised," it continued.
Bennington's body was found at a private home in Los Angeles on Thursday. The LA County Coroner said he apparently hanged himself.
He had previously struggled with addiction and had spoken to BBC Newsbeat about depression and suicide.
The statement continued: "In the past few days, we've seen an outpouring of love and support, both public and private, from around the world.
"Talinda and the family appreciate it, and want the world to know that you were the best husband, son, and father; the family will never be whole without you."
Bennington, 41, had six children, three with his wife Talinda.
The band are storming into this week's UK album and singles charts following Bennington's death, according to the Official Charts Company's midweek update.
Seven of the band's albums are on course to enter the top 40, with their debut, 2001's Hybrid Theory, currently at number three and One More Light, released earlier this year, at five. Meteora, the group's first UK number one, at seven.
Three of their hits are also on course to reach the singles charts. In The End - Linkin Park's first UK top 10 back in 2001 - is on course to re-enter at nine.
2003's Numb is at number 13, while Numb/Encore, the band's 2004 collaboration with Jay-Z, is at 29.
Artists can only have a maximum of three songs in the top 40 at any one time. The rules recently changed in an attempt to stop A-list artists elbowing newer acts out of the way.
Formed in 1996, Linkin Park have sold more than 70 million albums worldwide and won two Grammy Awards.
Meteora topped the Billboard 200 chart in 2003 and is regarded as one of the biggest indie rock records of all time.
