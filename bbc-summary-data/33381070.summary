Greece debt crisis: Voices from a small island

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
As Greeks decide how to vote in Sunday's referendum on the terms of the country's international bailout, the BBC has asked four islanders who run businesses on Democracy Avenue on the island of Aegina how the country's financial woes have affected them - and which way they plan to vote.

Democracy Avenue runs parallel to the main ferry port on Aegina.
The holiday destination is close to Athens and popular with foreign and Greek tourists alike.
Aegina also regularly plays host to Greece's current Prime Minister, Alexis Tsipras, and his Finance Minister Yanis Varoufakis.
But despite the island's popularity and accessibility, its economy is suffering.
A fall in visitors from abroad, put off by the debt crisis, plus the tight restrictions on cash withdrawals affecting Greek residents, have hit Aegina's businesses hard.
Room occupancy this summer is just 15%, a spokesman for the island's hotel owners said, down from around 80% in good times.
To find out how the situation is affecting day-to-day life on Aegina we spoke to four islanders who run businesses on Democracy Avenue to find out how Greece's financial woes have affected them - and how they plan to vote.
1. Thodoris Miras, 31, bar owner
Islanders are relatively isolated and dependent on tourism, says Thodoris. The last five months of negotiations have been hard for local businesses.
The capital controls mean that people can't be paid and the business is struggling to buy products it needs.
Thodoris will be voting "Yes" as he doesn't want to gamble away his business. No one knows what would happen if it's a "No" vote, he says.
2. Nektaria Kakousi, 41, fruit seller
Nektaria says Greek people need to learn to work hard as those that do "always succeed."
She's also noticed a difference, particularly in the last two years, and says customers are always watching the bill.
She's not worried about the result of the referendum as she believes the result is "already planned".
Nektaria says Greece is the most beautiful place in the world and it will never die.
3. Kostas Miras, 83, cafe owner
Kostas Miras has owned and worked in his cafe on Democracy Avenue for more than sixty years.
The pensioner lived under the Nazi occupation of Greece but he still fears for the future. He believes neither option in the upcoming referendum is good for the country.
He believes it would be difficult to go back to the drachma.
Kostas will be voting yes as he want to stay in Europe, he says.
4. Yianna Sorou, 52, fishmonger
It's an early start for Yianna each morning at a fishmonger's at a market just off Democracy Avenue. It's a business she inherited from her grandfather.
The financial crisis has changed the island, she says, as people think twice about the expense of making the trip.
She says sales of fish have fallen as Greek people now consider it too expensive, despite it once being "the food of poor people."
She believes there is no other choice for Greece but to stay in the eurozone.
