Apology over Southampton primary school admissions error

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Parents have received an apology after a council error led to children being allocated the wrong school places.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Southampton City Council said a "technical issue" in the admissions process had affected a number of reception class places in the city's schools.
The authority said corrected letters were being sent out.
It has apologised for causing "any inconvenience or uncertainty" to parents.
A council spokesman said: "The information that Southampton City Council sent to Hampshire County Council to enable the county to make offers to parents did not transfer.
"As a result, some parents received letters with the incorrect information."
