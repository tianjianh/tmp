'Trojan Horse': Government criticises education select committee

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The government has claimed MPs risked undermining efforts to tackle extremism by downplaying the seriousness of the "Trojan Horse" events in Birmingham.

The Department for Education was responding to the education select committee's report on an alleged school takeover plot led by a conservative group of Muslims.
Published in March, the report found only one incident of extremism.
It also said there was no evidence of a plot take over the city's schools.
The Department for Education said: "This downplays the seriousness of events in Birmingham and risks undermining our efforts to tackle extremism.
"It is important to state clearly just how damaging these were to the young people in the care of those schools."
Several inquiries and investigations were launched after an anonymous letter surfaced last March containing instructions for installing sympathetic school governors.
It has since been declared a hoax, and claims made about a number of schools named in the letter have been deemed groundless.
However, 21 schools were investigated by Ofsted after the letter was published, with five put into special measures last year.
Birmingham City Council has introduced new rules for appointing governors in the wake of the controversy.
