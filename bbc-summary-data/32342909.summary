Three other Nigerians - Boko Haram leader Abubakar Shekau, President-elect Muhammadu Buhari, and #BringBackOurGirls campaigner Obiageli Ezekwesil - also appear on the list.
Ms Adichie, 37, is hailed by the US magazine as a "creator of characters".
The four Nigerians appear with three other Africans on the annual list.
They include Sudanese aid worker Mustafa Hassan, Liberia's Ebola-fighting doctor Jerry Brown and Tunisia's President Beji Caid Essebsi.
Ms Adichie is described in the US magazine as "rare novelist who in the space of a year finds her words sampled by Beyonce, optioned by Lupita Nyong'o and honoured with the National Book Critics Circle Award for fiction".
"With her viral TEDxEuston talk, We Should All Be Feminists, she found her voice as cultural critic," wrote Radhika Jones, a deputy managing editor of Time.
