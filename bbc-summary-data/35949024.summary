Carlisle United 1-2 Mansfield Town

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Mansfield Town kept faint hopes of a League Two play-off place alive as Reggie Lambe's goal secured victory away to fellow hopefuls Carlisle.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Tuesday's win against Hartlepool left the home side just outside the play-offs, but they are now down to 10th.
Colin Daniel grabbed a first-half opener for the Stags, tucking in from 12-yards before Lambe doubled the lead.
Tom Miller replied in stoppage time, but Mansfield hung on to remain six points short of the top seven.
