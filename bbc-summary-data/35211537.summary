Aguero surged past Sebastien Bassong, sidestepped Russell Martin and poked in a shot to put the visitors ahead.
The Argentine striker then teased the home defence before laying the ball off for Kelechi Iheanacho to side-foot in.
Manchester City were dominant and Kevin de Bruyne jinked his way to goal before powering in a low shot for their third.
Reaction to Saturday's FA Cup third-round games
Aguero has had his injury troubles this season but Blues boss Manuel Pellegrini has predicted the forward will return to his best form as his side challenge for four trophies.
The Argentine is proving true to his manager's words as he showed the qualities of pace, power and finishing prowess which make him so feared.
Apart from his opening goal, he played a one-two with Iheanacho before having a first-time shot palmed wide by keeper John Ruddy.
Aguero teased Norwich's defence before setting up Iheanacho for his side's second and Pellegrini will be left hoping his star striker can now stay fit.
Norwich and the visitors made seven changes each but, while Pellegrini's team retained the look of a strong side, the Canaries struggled to cope.
Conceding an early goal did not help and the second for the visitors left the Carrow Road crowd almost silent as their team offered them little to cheer.
Norwich showed little sign of being able to mount a comeback. The closest they came to scoring was when Graham Dorrans had a shot was palmed wide by visiting keeper Willy Caballero, who also tipped over a late Kyle Lafferty header.
However, it appeared more of a damage-limitation exercise for manager Alex Neil's side, who can now concentrate on their battle to stay in the Premier League.
Norwich boss Alex Neil: "In the first half, we didn't retain the ball well enough and good teams will punish you. We played better in the second half but the damage had already been done.
"We will forget this game as of now. Our bread and butter is the league."
Manchester City manager Manuel Pellegrini: "It was a very good performance. From the beginning we were very aggressive
"Sergio Aguero scored a beautiful goal.
"One of the merits of this squad is to be involved in all the competitions with the injuries that we have had."
Former Manchester City defender Danny Mills on BBC Final Score: "It was too simple for Manchester City - I was expecting Norwich to put on a better show.
"But that first goal from Sergio Aguero was exceptional - he beats three or four defenders before finishing. It was worthy of Lionel Messi."
Norwich will visit Stoke in a the Premier League on Wednesday, while Manchester City host Everton on the same night.
