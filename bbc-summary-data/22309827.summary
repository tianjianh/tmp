Doctors Prana and Nishebita Das robbery: Two jailed

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A woman and a man have been jailed for assaulting and robbing two married doctors in their home, leaving one brain damaged.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Dr Prana Das, 66, was hit around the head so violently he will never practise medicine again.
He and his wife, Dr Nishebita Das, were in bed near Langstone, Newport, when Edward Donovan, 51, and Rhiannon Gibbons, 27, broke in to their home.
Donovan was jailed for 15 years and Gibbons for 10 at Cardiff Crown Court.
David Elias, prosecuting, told the court: "Mrs Das was woken by a man covering her mouth with his hand, saying, 'I won't hurt you, don't shout'.
"He asked her where her husband was and in complete terror she said he was in another bedroom.
"A pillowcase was put over her head and her hands were tied. She heard the sound of her husband being attacked in his bedroom before he was brought into her room.
"The pillowcase was lifted and she could see her husband - his face was covered in blood and there was a knife held to his throat."
Dr Das heard her husband screaming, "don't beat me," as the burglars demanded to know where their valuables were kept.
Donovan, of Commercial Road, Newport, and Gibbons, of Chepstow Road, Newport, escaped with Â£100,000 worth of possessions.
The pair were both found guilty last month of grievous bodily harm with intent and unlawful wounding in relation to Dr Prana Das. They were also found guilty of actual bodily harm (ABH) in relation to Dr Nishebita Das and two counts of robbery.
The court heard that Donovan had 29 previous court appearances for 87 offences including robbery and aggravated burglary.
Gibbons has appeared in court 12 times for 29 offences, including robbery.
The Recorder of Cardiff Judge Eleri Rees said: "Their home was deliberately targeted and you were working together as a team.
"This was a carefully planned robbery carried out with ruthlessness and no regard for the victims. You showed no remorse."
Addressing Donovan, she added: "I have no doubt the public need protection from you for a considerable length of time."
