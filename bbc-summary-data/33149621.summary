[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Janice Atkinson, who is a South East MEP, has become vice president of the group at the European Parliament called the Europe of Nations and Freedom.
She was expelled from UKIP for bringing the "party into disrepute" over an expenses claim.
She denied any wrongdoing.
The alliance will also include representatives from far-right parties in the Netherlands and Austria, including Gert Wilders' Freedom Party.
Ms Atkinson said: "A stable and committed new group in the European parliament is launched, bringing new weight to bear against the ideology of the European Union.
"The bitter fruits of the European project are an everyday reality for citizens in Britain and for the whole continent of Europe.
"The mercilessness of the European agenda is felt by millions across Europe impoverished by the cruelty of the Euro. Mass immigration into Britain and Europe continues to accelerate at the behest of the same EU ideology."
The alliance will be the second Eurosceptic grouping in the parliament.
The other, Europe of Freedom and Direct Democracy, is chaired by the UKIP leader Nigel Farage.
Ms Atkinson was thrown out of UKIP in March after allegations a member of her staff tried to arrange a false receipt for a meal.
