Marussia and Caterham to miss US Grand Prix - Bernie Ecclestone

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Formula 1 boss Bernie Ecclestone has said Caterham and Marussia will both miss the US Grand Prix next weekend.

Caterham are in administration and have also been granted permission to miss the Brazilian Grand Prix while Marussia are struggling financially.
Marussia driver Jules Bianchi remains in hospital having sustained serious head injuries in an accident at the Japanese Grand Prix on 5 October.
"Neither of those teams are going to go to America," Ecclestone told Reuters.
Marussia look likely to miss the Brazilian Grand Prix as well, due to the air transport for all the F1 team cars and freight being organised by Ecclestone's Formula One Management.
The races in Austin, Texas and Sao Paulo are back-to-back and the cars will be transported direct from the US to Brazil before returning to Europe.
Both Marussia and Caterham are based in Oxfordshire.
Marussia's absence will leave the grid in Austin with only nine teams and 18 cars, the first time that has happened since the 2005 Monaco Grand Prix.
It also means American Alexander Rossi, the Marussia reserve, will not make an appearance at his home race.
The team raced with only one car in Russia earlier this month as a mark of respect to Bianchi, who is continuing to receive treatment in Japan.
Their other driver, Max Chilton, is yet to register a world championship point this season.
Caterham drivers Marcus Ericsson and Kamui Kobayashi have also failed to score any points in 2014.
Control of Caterham's Leafield factory has been handed over to London-based accountants Smith & Williamson.
Staff have been told not to return to work until a new buyer for the team has been found.
