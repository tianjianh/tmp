[SN]TITLE[SN]
American bulldog breeder Stephen Potts loses appeal bid

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A dog breeder whose American bulldogs attacked a man has lost his appeal to save his animals from being put down.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Stephen Potts, 48, from County Durham, was jailed in August after his animals bit Lindsay Edwards, 63, leaving his skull exposed.
He was jailed for three months and the six dogs were ordered to be destroyed.
Mr Potts appealed against the destruction order, but it was refused by London's Court of Appeal. He was not appealing his jail sentence.
He has two weeks to appeal against the decision and for it to be heard by three judges at the same court.
Mr Potts, was also banned from owning dogs for life which he is also appealing against.
The attack on Mr Edwards in October, 2014 Belmont happened weeks after Mr Potts had been savaged by two of his own dogs and had to have an arm amputated.
Mr Potts, from Low Pittington, County Durham, had denied seven charges of owning dangerously out of control dogs.
However, on the second day of his trial at Durham Crown Court he admitted six lesser charges of being in charge of a dog dangerously out of control in a public place.
The two dogs that cost him his arm have already been destroyed.
