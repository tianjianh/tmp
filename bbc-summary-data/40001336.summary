[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Motherwell have confirmed eight first-team players will leave the club when their contracts expire this month.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Striker Scott McDonald, goalkeeper Craig Samson, Joe Chalmers, Lee Lucas, Craig Moore, David Ferguson and Stephen Pearson will depart Fir Park.
Zak Jules returns to Reading following the end of his loan spell.
The Steelmen are, however, in talks with Keith Lasley, Lionel Ainsworth and Russell Griffiths with a view to keeping the trio at the club.
Well, who finished ninth in the Premiership, have released Dylan Mackin, Tom Fry and Jordan Pettigrew from their under-20s but have opened discussions with Barry Maguire, Dylan Falconer, Shea Gordon, Peter Morrison and Adam Livingstone over new deals.
Motherwell manager Stephen Robinson told the club's website: "First of all, I want to thank everyone who will leave Fir Park for the last time as a Motherwell player.
"There are a lot of lads there who have played a lot of football for this club or have came through the ranks here, and it's important we acknowledge that. It is never a nice or easy part of the game when people leave, but I have sat down with every one of them to give them my thoughts, which is the least I can do.
"At the moment, we have 13 senior players contracted and the hard work has already started. I hope to have the first of the new arrivals in the door soon; I don't intend to waste any time rebuilding, as it's a big job."
