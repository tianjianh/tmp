[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The brother of a man who murdered his pregnant ex-girlfriend has been jailed for perverting the course of justice.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Jake Blakeley, 18, of Abbotts Road, Didcot admitted lying to police during their enquiries into the murder of Jayden Parkinson, 17.
He was acquitted of helping to hide her body after telling the court he believed he was burying dead animals.
Jayden was murdered in December 2013 by Jake's brother Ben, 22, from Reading, who is serving a life sentence.
Her body was found on 18 December in the grave of her killer's uncle at All Saints Church in Didcot.
Oxford Crown Court heard Jake Blakeley thought he was burying weapons, a cat and a dog.
He initially told police he knew nothing about Jayden's whereabouts and had not come forward with the information about helping his brother to bury something.
The 15 months he has spent on remand will count towards the three-year sentence.
Jayden's mother Samantha Shrewsbury said in a statement after the sentencing: "Time will never erase the evil that took Jayden from us. We can never forget or forgive the Blakeley brothers. Our nightmare will never end."
A Thames Valley Police spokesman said: "Even unwittingly Jake Blakeley assisted his brother Ben to conceal Jayden's body after she was murdered, assistance which prolonged the agony of Jayden's family.
"I believe today's sentence reflects the severity of this."
