Owners Balfour Beatty, which bought the site in 2008, put it up for sale in August but no buyer has been found.
Balfour Beatty said the site had made a loss for several years. On Tuesday, Blackpool Council said more should have been done to save the airport.
The final flight departed for the Isle of Man at 17:00 BST, marking the end of the airport's operations.
A spokesman said the airport was working "with the independent aviation businesses and tenants to understand if their operations can continue in the future".
"Working in partnership with the local authorities, regeneration plans are also being developed which will be designed to create future employment and sustainable economic development opportunities," he said.
Aerospace company BAE Systems said it was in talks with a number of operators to offer short-term use of its aviation facilities.

Blackpool Council has also blamed the airport's "onerous contract" with Jet2 along with a failure to bring in new routes.
Flight operator Jet2 transferred its flights from Blackpool to Manchester on Friday.
The final day also saw another Citywing flight depart for the Isle of Man at 10:10 and an Aer Lingus aeroplane leave for Dublin at 15:20.
About 110 staff are employed at the airport, which served 235,000 passengers last year.
