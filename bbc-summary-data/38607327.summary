The warning has been given because strong wind and high tides could combine today causing the sea level to rise.
This could mean houses and roads on the east coast could be flooded.
A "severe" warning means there could be a "danger to life". Many people have already been evacuated or told to be aware and the army has been called in in some places to keep people safe.
The areas that are particularly at risk are Lincolnshire, Norfolk, Suffolk and Essex.
