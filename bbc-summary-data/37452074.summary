Leading the prayers in Polish and English, Father Bogdan Kot, a priest at Harlow's Catholic Church, said: "We gather together to pray and ask why?
"Why God allowed this to happen? Whatever the cause God will bring good out of it, if we let him."
Mr Jozwik was cremated on Thursday at a private service.
His ashes were buried on Friday at a memorial service attended by friends and family.
Speaking at the service, his friend Eric Hind said: "Arek was a wonderful man and even better friend.
"We loved the same video games, we watched the same TV shows.
"He was one of the few people I've met who actually cared, he was a true friend.
"Let's all think back how Arek touched our lives. We should all be thankful we were given chance to know a man called Arek."
Mr Jozwik was taken Addenbrooke's Hospital after the attack where he was pronounced dead.
Six teenagers have been arrested and released on police bail as part of a murder inquiry.
In the aftermath of his death, more than 1,000 people - including Poles from across the UK - gathered for a vigil in Harlow.
