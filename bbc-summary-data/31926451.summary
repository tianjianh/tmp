A painting that languished in a museum store room for more than 50 years dismissed as a replica could be worth up to Â£1m.

Experts say the painting at Derby Museum is an original by Joseph Wright, one of the UK's most acclaimed artists.
Coliseum by Moonlight was painted in the 1780s after Wright toured Italy and will now undergo a year's restoration.
Museum staff said it was placed in storage after being badly over-painted by a restorer in the early 1960s.
Lucy Bamford, senior curator of art, said subsequent staff did not know about the restoration and the painting was mistakenly re-catalogued as being by a follower of Wright.
It was finally uncovered after the museum's conservator, who was working on its companion - Coliseum by Daylight - discovered literature that showed the museum was meant to hold two paintings of the Coliseum by Wright.
"We said 'That can't be. There's one in the store but it's absolutely terrible'," Ms Bamford said.
"Once we got it out... we realised that there was something behind that painting which was worth investigating."
Infrared technology will be used to reveal what is left of the painting and conservator Mark Roberts will use solvents to remove the over paint.

Ms Bamford said Wright was "undoubtedly one of Britain's greatest painters".
She said placing the two paintings together would show how Wright was thinking about comparing and contrasting different lights sources, effects and compositions.
"It's a really interesting insight into Wright's working methods and the way that he thought," she said.
Wright was born in Derby and his patrons included Wedgewood and Arkwright.
He became associated with the Industrial Revolution of the 18th Century but his main interest was the rendering of light.
The painting will be displayed mid-way through its restoration process at the museum in the summer as part of the Grand Tour art event in the East Midlands.
