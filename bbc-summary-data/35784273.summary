Giuseppe Rossi, who played alongside Neville at Manchester United, scored the only goal of the game when he volleyed in from Juanfran's long throw.
Valencia's Sofiane Feghouli had a shot saved by Levante goalkeeper Diego Marino and later curled an effort wide.
Neville has now won only three of 15 La Liga games and Valencia are 12th, eight points above the relegation zone.
The 41-year-old former England international was appointed in December, on a contract until the end of the season, but has struggled in his first managerial role.
Valencia are on course for their worst league finish since they came 14th in La Liga in 1987-88 and are fewer points away from the relegation zone than a top-six place that would secure European football next season.
Indeed, Neville's team face a vital match on Thursday as they look to overturn a 1-0 deficit when they host Athletic Bilbao in the second leg of their last-16 Europa League tie.
For Levante, this was a deserved victory as they restricted their visitors to only one shot on target for their sixth league win of the season.
Rossi hit the post in the first half and Valencia goalkeeper Diego Alves also made fine saves from Deyverson and Zouhair Feddal.
But Rossi got in front of marker Shkodran Mustafi to steer Juanfran's long throw-in into the bottom corner to earn the victory.
