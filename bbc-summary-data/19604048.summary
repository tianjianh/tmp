Both are pupils at Plymouth College, where the parade departed from before heading to the city's Guildhall.
Crowds six deep greeted them, waving flags as the Olympians appeared.
Daley said: "It's been crazy. The amount of people along the streets is amazing.
"A massive thank you from all of us for showing your support."
He also thanked Plymouth College.
"They have been incredible adapting the timetable so we can train at the same time.
"It's a lot of thanks to Plymouth College that I got to the Olympics.
"It's been pretty crazy since the Games, but it's getting back to normal now with school and training and my two annoying brothers."
Lithuanian swimmer Meilutyte said: "I have been here for almost two and a half years and it's been incredible.
"Plymouth is almost like my second home and I'm really proud to be here."

Thousands of people lined the streets of Plymouth to congratulate the city's Olympians and Paralympians.
For most of the journey from Plymouth College to the Guildhall there was a stream of people, many with union flags and banners saying 'Well Done Tom' and 'I Love You Tom'.
Drivers of buses and cars honked their horns and one woman in a parked car was leaning out of the sunroof and honking the horn with her foot.
As we approached Royal Parade hundreds of people were lining the streets and the noise was deafening.

Other Olympic athletes taking part included divers Tonia Couch and Sarah Barrow, swimmers Antony James, Jamila Lunkuse and Jade Howard, and fencer Corinna Lawrence.
Barrow tweeted: "How incredible was the Plymouth welcome home parade! Thank you to everyone who came :)"
Couch said: "The parade makes you feel really special, especially in your home city."
Wheelchair basketball player Judith Hamer and Paralympic table tennis player David Wetherill, from Torpoint in Cornwall, joined them.
Wetherill said: "I'm not used to this much attention. This was so much better than London."
Daley's diving coach Andy Banks and Meilutyte's swimming coach Jon Rudd also took part in the parade.
London 2012 Games Makers from Plymouth, the volunteers who helped at Olympic venues, joined the parade in their uniforms and walked behind the bus as it travelled down Royal Parade.
Stella Goodman, who was watching the parade with three generations of her family, said: "We are proud, proud to be Plymothians and see them today."
Deputy council leader Peter Smith said: "It's fantastic that so many of the city's sportsmen and women were selected to take part in the Games and that two of them have won medals.
"They are a true inspiration - not just to youngsters here in Plymouth but all over the country - some of whom will one day follow in their footsteps."
