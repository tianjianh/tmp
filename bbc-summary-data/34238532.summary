Saturday's ceremony, a precursor to the main awards on 20 September, featured categories such as best casting, sound and visual effects.
HBO's Thrones saga, based on George RR Martin's books, was followed by FX Networks' American Horror Story: Freak Show with five awards.
HBO won the most prizes with 29, followed by NBC with 11.
FX Networks was next with eight awards, while ABC, Cartoon Network, Comedy Central, Fox and PBS took home four.
Netflix, Amazon, CBS and the Discovery Channel won three each.
The best documentary prize was won by The Jinx: The Life and Deaths of Robert Durst, about a former real estate tycoon under suspicion for three murders.
Durst, 72, was charged with murder after appearing to confess to three killings during the filming of the documentary.
The ceremony also gave prizes to guest actors for drama and comedy series, with trophies going to Reg E Cathey for House of Cards, Margo Martindale for The Americans, Joan Cusack for Shameless and Bradley Whitford for Transparent.
The best made-for-TV movie award was won by Bessie, a biopic about US blues singer Bessie Smith starring Queen Latifah.
Sibling choreographers Derek and Julianne Hough were recognised for their work on Dancing with the Stars, the US version of Strictly Come Dancing.
But they had to share the prize not only with colleague Tessandra Chavez but also with Travis Wall, honoured for his work on Fox's So You Think You Can Dance.
Hank Azaria won the best voice-over performance prize for The Simpsons, while former Glee star Jane Lynch was named best reality host for Hollywood Game Night.
Andy Samberg will host this year's Primetime Emmy awards ceremony, to be held in Los Angeles on 20 September.
