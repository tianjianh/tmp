Labour 'undermined' by welfare rebellion

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Labour MPs who defied the leadership over the government's Welfare Bill have undermined the party's attempts to regain power, its work and pensions spokesman says.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Stephen Timms said the 18 new MPs who were among the 48 rebels should focus on supporting the party.
The Commons backed the Welfare Reform and Work Bill by 308 to 124 votes.
Former Labour home secretary David Blunkett said the party was suffering post-election "emotional trauma".
The SNP said it was "disgraceful" that Labour had not joined it in opposing the bill.
Labour had told its MPs to abstain on the bill, which includes plans to limit child tax credit to two children.
Rebels included leadership hopeful Jeremy Corbyn and London mayoral candidates Sadiq Khan and David Lammy.
First Harriet Harman took a stand - saying Labour had to wake up and listen to voters on welfare.
Then she compromised - tabling an amendment designed to sidestep a row. And then almost 50 rebels ignored her instructions.
Were she Labour's permanent leader, her authority would be in tatters.
But it's not about her; she'll be gone by the autumn.
The real question is: could any of her would-be successors persuade the party that welfare must be reformed now?
Would they want, or dare, to try?

Mr Timms told BBC Radio London the rebellion was "smaller than quite a lot of people expected", and included a number of MPs who regularly defy the party whip.
He added: "There were also a number of newer members who broke the whip and I hope as we go into the summer recess they will conclude that they really want to be supporting our party's efforts to replace the current government rather than undermining them."
But one of the new-intake rebels, Cardiff Central MP Jo Stevens, told BBC News she did not agree, saying the bill, which include £12bn in welfare cuts, was focusing on working families.
She said she did not criticise any of her colleagues for the way they had voted but that there "may be a new approach" when a new leader is in place in September.
Apart from Mr Corbyn, all the leadership contenders - Andy Burnham, Yvette Cooper and Liz Kendall - followed Ms Harman's lead and abstained.
Ms Stevens said they had "no choice" as they were bound by collective responsibility.
Ms Harman has faced criticism for her stance, with many MPs saying she should have been more outspoken in her opposition to curbs on child tax credits and cuts to other in-work benefits.
A Labour amendment seeking to derail the legislation was defeated by 308 votes to 208.
Mr Corbyn  denied he was fuelling a split in the Labour Party, saying the revolt had "strengthened" Labour's position against the Conservatives.
He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme society ought to be "deeply concerned" about  child poverty and deprivation levels.
During a five-hour debate, Labour MP John McDonnell said he would "swim through vomit" to oppose the legislation.
Reacting to the vote, Labour MP Diane Abbott tweeted: "Just voted against Tory welfare bill. Sorry for colleagues who knew it was wrong but abstained. We weren't sent to Parliament to abstain."
Conservative MP and chief secretary to the Treasury Greg Hands tweeted: "47 Labour rebels on welfare tonight. Huge. Biggest Labour rebellion for some time. Leadership crisis without actually having a Leader!"
Mr Blunkett, who also served as work and pensions secretary, said the party was in "emotional trauma", and was "not debating enough about where we go from here".
"Last night again focused on us being divided," he said, adding that the Welfare Bill was "clearly not a moment for setting out the alternative".
MPs who won their seats in May were "very lucky" and should ask themselves "why others didn't", he added.
The bill, which also seeks to lower the overall household benefit cap from £26,000 a year to £20,000 outside of London, and £23,000 in London, as well as to train a further three million apprentices, has now cleared its first parliamentary hurdle and will move on to more detailed scrutiny.
In a passionate debate, Conservative MPs lined up to support the measures.
As well as Labour MPs who did not support the bill, it was opposed by the SNP, the Liberal Democrats, Plaid Cymru and the Greens.
SNP employment spokeswoman Hannah Bardell said: "Labour had the perfect opportunity to join the SNP in a progressive coalition to oppose the Tories - but with some honourable exceptions they sat on their hands."
On Twitter, SNP MP Pete Wishart said it was "apparent" that Labour and the SNP together could have defeated the bill.
Tim Farron, in his first Commons speech as Liberal Democrat leader, said his party was voting against the "unfair, unwise and inhuman" proposals.
Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith said Labour was beset by "internal fear and loathing" and that the bill would put welfare funding on a "more sustainable footing" while protecting those most in need.
Speaking after the vote, he said: "Nearly 50 Labour MPs have defied their leadership and opposed our welfare reforms which will move our country from a low wage, high tax and high welfare economy to a higher wage, lower tax and lower welfare society.
"It's clear that Labour are still the same old anti-worker party - just offering more welfare, more borrowing and more taxes."
