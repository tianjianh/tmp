Six Nations 2016: Trinh-Duc and Fofana start for France v Scotland

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
France have made six changes to face Scotland in Sunday's Six Nations match at Murrayfield.

Francois Trinh-Duc starts at fly-half and Scott Spedding at full-back in the side named by head coach Guy Noves.
Wesley Fofana, usually a centre, comes in on the wing, while Gael Fickou is at centre for the game in Edinburgh.
Yoann Maestri is promoted from the bench to start at lock, while Yacouba Camara replaces the injured Antoine Burban at open-side flanker.
Jules Plisson and Maxime Medard both drop to the bench to make way for Trinh-Duc and Spedding.
Noves said it was always his intention to give Trinh-Duc, who was a replacement against Wales, a start at some stage during the tournament.
"With Jules, Francois has the keys to the lorry at the moment," said the France coach.
"He was in our original squad and wasn't quite fully fit, but he has played a few games for his club and a bit for us, so we felt it would be interesting to see him start this match."
Djibril Camara makes way for Fofana, while Fickou replaces Jonathan Danty.
Paul Jedrasiak drops out as Maestri starts the game and Sebastien Vahaamahina joins the replacements.
With an eye on developing the core of a squad that will take Les Bleus through to the 2019 World Cup, Noves has made a host of changes for each match of the tournament.
"We are still in the early stages of our development," he noted. "We have set out on a path and we will go down it with a strong group of 35 or 40 guys."
Noves believes Scotland, who have not beaten France since 2006, are at a higher level under coach Vern Cotter than some recent results might suggest.
"They are taking on a certain dimension and that is down to Vern," he added. "He gives them confidence despite some of the results.
"You can see a team which is evolving and progressing, so that again could be an example for our own rugby."
