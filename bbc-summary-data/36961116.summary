[SN]TITLE[SN]
Luton Town 3-1 Aston Villa

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Five-time winners Aston Villa were knocked out of the EFL Cup in the first round by League Two side Luton Town.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Villa, without an away win since August 2015, took the lead at Kenilworth Road when Jordan Ayew scuffed home.
Jake Gray equalised with a neat finish and Cameron McGeehan capitalised on a fortuitous rebound to put Luton ahead against a side relegated from the Premier League last term.
Jores Okore turned into his own net to compound Villa's misery.
The Denmark international diverted past Mark Bunn, after the keeper could only get his fingertips to Gray's low ball into the area.
Villa, without a win in all competitions since February, had started the better when Ayew found the bottom corner after outmuscling the defence at a corner.
But after Gray's first goal for the Hatters made it 1-1, former Norwich midfielder McGeehan was left with a tap in when Gray's strike rebounded off Bunn and Jack Grealish into his path.

Villa striker Rudy Gestede's effort was cleared off the line before McGeehan's strike, and Okore's misfortune secured Nathan Jones' side a deserved victory.
