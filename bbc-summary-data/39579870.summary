In the last two seasons the 26-year-old has played in teams that have gone down from the division, and the left-back is keen to avoid an unwanted hat-trick.
"I don't want to do it [relegation] any more - it's not fun, hopefully I don't do it any more," he told BBC Sport.
"Everyone wants to do well for the manager. Everyone's working hard so I honestly think we'll be all right."
With four games remaining this season, the Devon side are 22nd, two points from safety.
Rowe-Turner is in his second spell with the Gulls, having played in their League Two play-off final defeat during his previous stint in 2011.
"I was here for a good two-and-a-half years before, so it does mean a lot to get the club to stay in this league," he added.
"It has been difficult to be fair, there's been a lot going on but you've just got to get on with it really.
"There's more motivation when things are being put against you - it makes you want to work harder and prove them wrong."
Meanwhile, Torquay have recalled centre-back Ben Gerring from his loan with Truro City.
