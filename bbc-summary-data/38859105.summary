Massimo Cellino: Football Association reduce Leeds United chairman's ban to 12 months

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Leeds United chairman Massimo Cellino's 18-month ban from football has been reduced to a year after a successful appeal against the decision.

The Italian was given the suspension in December for breaching the Football Association's agent rules over the sale of Ross McCormack to Fulham in 2014.
Despite the reduction, the 60-year-old has confirmed he will appeal against the decision at the High Court.
Cellino's ban is due to come into force on 18 February.
He and the club were also fined £250,000, but his fine has now been reduced to £100,000 and the club's to £200,000.
Leeds released a statement to say they were "disappointed by the outcome" of their appeal against the ruling.
The statement continued: "It is important to note, that no other club official, director, chairman or owner have ever been joined in as a party to any other alleged FA agents regulations breaches. Also, no fines have ever been issued over and above £100,000.
"The original decision and now the appeal decision are so excessive and disproportionate, that Mr Cellino feels, like he always has, duty bound to continue the fight against such injustice for the good of the club and its supporters.
"Additionally, Mr Cellino has been concerned throughout this process not just about the true independence of the FA but also about the consistent and numerous leaks of information connected to this matter leaking to the media."
The ban is the third imposed on the former Cagliari owner by the FA since taking over the Elland Road club in April 2014.
In January, he sold 50% of the club to fellow Italian businessman Andrea Radrizzani.
Leeds are fourth in the Championship, five points behind second-placed Newcastle.
