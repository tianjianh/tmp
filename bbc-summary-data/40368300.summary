[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Cornish Pirates coach Alan Paver says he and his side "will be better" this season as they look to improve on their sixth-placed Championship finish.

Paver, along with joint-boss Gavin Cattle, has spent time with Super Rugby sides in New Zealand this summer.
"We've been out to different high-performance environments. We've come back, and grown a lot," Paver said.
"We've accelerated, and this group has, but this is a results-based business so sometimes you can be better."
He told BBC Radio Cornwall: "What I thought I was like as a coach two years ago and what I think of myself looking back, we are miles away from that."
Pirates have largely retained the squad which missed out on the play-offs by three points last term.
They have bolstered their ranks with four signings, including Argentina sevens player Nicolas Coronel and ex-Nottingham lock Toby Freeman.
"There are so many factors that you have to take into play, but the one thing I can guarantee is that all of us collectively will be better."
