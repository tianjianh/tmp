'28 Pages': Newly released 9/11 documents find no official Saudi link

Congress has released previously classified documents about whether the Saudi government had a role in the 9/11 attacks.

The pages show no officials links between the Saudi government and the hijackers who killed nearly 3,000 people in New York.
However, the report found it was likely that the attackers had financial help from people inside the kingdom.
An independent panel completed the 9/11 Commission Report in 2002.
But several pages - informally known as "the 28 Pages" - were withheld from the public for 13 years, fuelling speculation about their contents.
For years, lawmakers and family members of the 9/11 victims lobbied for their release, arguing the US government was shielding an important ally.
Fifteen of the 19 hijackers who flew planes into the World Trade Center and the Pentagon were Saudi nationals.
The released pages were still lightly redacted by the CIA. The report's original authors cautioned that some of the information contained in "the 28 pages" was unvetted material complied by the FBI.
The Saudi government said it welcomed the release of the documents on Friday.
The release confirms "neither the Saudi government, nor senior Saudi officials, nor any person acting on behalf of the Saudi government provided any support or encouragement for these attacks,'' Abdullah Al-Saud, Saudi Arabia's ambassador to the United States, said in a statement on Friday.
