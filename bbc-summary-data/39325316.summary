Fire crews found the group 10m (32ft) up the cliff face in a former air-raid shelter off Chalkpit Road, Portsmouth, shortly after 17:20 GMT on Sunday.
Crews used ladders to reach the stranded girls and brought them down one by one.
The girls, who were all rescued uninjured, were given safety advice by firefighters.
