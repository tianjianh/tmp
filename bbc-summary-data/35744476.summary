A treasured ring that was lost in the sea was returned to its owner five months later after being washed up on a beach.

Mike Rose, 54, lost the gold band when it slipped from his finger into waves while surfing as Caswell Bay, Swansea.
Despite trawling the coastline with a metal detector, he gave up on finding the heirloom given to him by his dad.
But after he offered a £100 reward, Mr Rose received an email from a beach-walker who found it buried in the sand.
"I honestly never thought I would see it again," said the father-of-two from Killay, Swansea.
But almost five months after losing it, he received the email from fire fighter David Gates, who had seen a poster Mr Rose put up.
He had found it near where Mr Rose had been surfing, buried one foot in the sand.
After giving Mr Gates the £100 and £10 for each of his children, he had the ring re-shaped so it would not slip off again.
