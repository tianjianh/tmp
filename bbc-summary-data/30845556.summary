It's after the singer travelled without approval for a concert and failed to complete community service on time - he's required to perform work such as graffiti removal.
The 25-year-old star has been on probation since 2009 for attacking his then-girlfriend, Rihanna.
Judge James Brandlin allowed Brown to remain free until a hearing in March.
Brown was ordered not to leave Los Angeles County without permission in December by probation officials.
The Grammy Award-winning singer performed in San Jose, just south of San Francisco, without asking if he could travel.
The star's lawyer Mark Geragos told Brandlin that his office incorrectly advised Brown that he didn't need permission.
Five people were shot at the nightclub that Chris Brown was performing at on Sunday morning.
Brown was supposed to complete 1,000 hours of community service by the end of January, but he still has around 200 hours to complete.

In another case in October 2013, Brown struck a man outside a Washington, D.C., hotel and was charged with misdemeanour assault.
Brandlin ordered Brown into rehab, but the singer was expelled from the programme in March 2014.
He spent two-and-a-half months in custody before being released in June.
