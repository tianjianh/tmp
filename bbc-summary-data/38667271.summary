[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A service has been held to celebrate the life of a woman who was killed in a house fire.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The body of Andraya Lyons, 39, was found in Drew Street, Swindon, on 10 December.
Her family asked people attending to wear bright colours as the service was intended to be a celebration of the mother of two's life.
Anthony Porter, 32, of Drew Street, is awaiting trial accused of Ms Lyons' murder.
During the service at the St John Baptist & St Helen church in Wroughton, a poem written by her boys was read out by the vicar, in which they said they "missed her smile, laughter and even shout".
"I think it was really fantastic that they were able to express something so clearly about her and the way they loved her - it was very moving," Canon Michael Johnson said.
"And the bright colours people were wearing was a real reflection of the kind of person Andraya was."
