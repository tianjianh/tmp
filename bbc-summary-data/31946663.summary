Local police officers with local knowledge are crucial to helping residents of rural Wales feel safe, a survey for Dyfed-Powys Police shows.

The research by university specialists found that communities want stronger neighbourhood bonds with the police.
The work, known as Rural Connect, was paid for by the force's police and crime commissioner Christopher Salmon.
Mr Salmon also said a decision to withdraw the Bobby Van scheme - a free home security service - was a mistake.
"Local policing is vital. I want officers to know and be known in their communities. That way we build trust and confidence," he said.
"This research is an important reminder of some old lessons. Local people say the small stuff matters.
"We must tackle the crime and antisocial behaviour that doesn't make headlines but does make their lives miserable.
"Senior officers must encourage the effort needed to build grassroots relationships. They must empower local officers to make judgements."
Mr Salmon will also look at better mobility for local officers, including cycles and mopeds, along with launching a campaign encouraging officers and the public to speak more often.Ã‚
