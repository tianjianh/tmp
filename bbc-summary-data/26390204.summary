In Jersey Victoria Avenue was closed by police, causing long delays for drivers trying to get in or out of St Helier.
Meanwhile in Guernsey, sea water flooded into shops in St Peter Port.
Jersey Met Office confirmed a tornado in St Clement caused damage to a house and blew a tree over into a road.
St Clement resident Gwyn Garfield-Bennett said it was a "scary experience".
"It was frightening - calm and then suddenly the house windows all rattled violently, there was a shaking and a huge chunk of big slate tiles fell on to my car and outside the front door," she said.
Jersey's Fire Service were called to the house at 19:00 GMT on Sunday and said the hole in the roof was about two square meters in size.
Crew Commander Mark Walker said: "Thankfully no-one was injured in this event.
"Tiles from the roof did fall in to the yard of the property and could have caused a serious injury if someone had been in that area."
The Jersey Met Office has issued a warning for Monday with winds up to 50mph expected.
The wind and tide caused damage to buildings and paths in the island. Rue Verte at L'Etacq was severely damaged in the high tide.
