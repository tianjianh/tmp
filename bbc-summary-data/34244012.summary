[SN]TITLE[SN]
Westbury cement works chimney to be demolished

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An industrial chimney which has loomed over part of Wiltshire's countryside for decades is to be demolished.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Westbury cement works were constructed in the early 1960s and mothballed in 2009.
In a bid to attract investors, non-operational parts of the site, including the 122m-high (400ft) chimney, are to be cleared.
The structure will be brought down with a series of controlled explosions, site owners Tarmac have said.
The chimney is just short of the height of the spire at Salisbury Cathedral, which stands at 123m-high (404ft) above ground level.
Earlier this month Tarmac said it had submitted a prior notice to Wiltshire Council to demolish part of the complex.
At present, the site is an attraction to trespassers and is "a security and maintenance liability".
"Demolition will result in reduced trespass and reduced needs for maintenance," he said.
The cement works are about 1.6km (1 mile) to the north east of Westbury, and the chimney is visible from miles away.
