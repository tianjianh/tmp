The 25-year-old, who has played for Gloucestershire since 2010, has agreed a three-year contract with Middlesex.
"We have been looking to sign a fast bowler with white-ball pedigree," said Middlesex managing director of cricket Angus Fraser.
"In James I believe we have found a bowler that will add extra bite and quality to this area."
Fuller was a key part of Gloucestershire's winning One-Day Cup campaign this year, taking 15 wickets including 2-34 in the final at Lord's.
Born in Cape Town, South Africa, he holds a UK passport and has taken 101 first-class wickets at an average of 33.90 with best figures of 6-24.
He also has 58 List A one-day wickets at an average of 25.17 and 62 Twenty20 wickets in 46 games.
"I have watched James bowl on numerous occasions and have been impressed with what I have seen," added Fraser.
"He is a fine athlete with a strong, easy action that allows him to bowl with good pace. James is extremely ambitious and is the sort of character that fits what Middlesex are looking for."
