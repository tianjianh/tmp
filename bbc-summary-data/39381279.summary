[SN]TITLE[SN]
Pro12: Benetton Treviso 13-5 Ospreys

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Ospreys ambition of winning a fifth Pro12 title suffered a massive blow as they were beaten 13-5 by Treviso.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Ospreys chose to rest their Wales Six Nations regulars so half-backs Dan Biggar and Rhys Webb were absent and coach Steve Tandy may rue the decision.
Treviso's win was just their third of the entire campaign and was secured by some solid defensive work and a host of Ospreys errors at Stadio Monigo.
Ospreys remain third, six points behind Leinster and four behind Munster.
Treviso almost opened the scoring after just three minutes when Dan Evans' attempted clearance was charged down, but a handling error at the last prevented a certain try.
However, they did take the lead a few moments later when Italy international Alberto Sgarbi went over, with Tito Tebaldi adding the extras.

The Ospreys were struggling in possession and to make significant territorial gains, but they struck just before the interval with a well worked try.
Sam Davies offloaded to Keelan Giles to score after a sharp turn of pace, but Davies could not add the extra points to ensure parity at the interval.
That miss became more pronounced when referee Nigel Owens punished Ospreys for scrum infringements and Tebaldi put them five points behind.
Sam Underhill and Nicky Smith were introduced from the bench, but Ian McKinley banged over another penalty for Treviso to put them eight points ahead with six minutes left.
