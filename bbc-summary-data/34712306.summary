[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Wales stars Sam Warburton, Gethin Jenkins and Alex Cuthbert return for struggling Cardiff Blues against Glasgow Warriors on Saturday.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Scrum-half Lloyd Williams starts after returning from the bench in their 26-15 defeat at Zebre last weekend.
Warriors have been boosted by the return of six players who featured for Scotland at the Rugby World Cup.
Stuart Hogg, Mark Bennett, Finn Russell, Jonny Gray, Josh Strauss and Ryan Grant are in the match-day squad.
The 34-year-old prop, Jenkins, leads Blues on his return to regional duty as head coach Danny Wilson makes seven changes.
Josh Navidi, Cam Dolan, Gareth Anscombe and Cory Allen will be absent through injury.
Wilson says he does not feel under any pressure in the wake of their poor start to the season.
After trouncing Zebre in their opening game of the season at Cardiff Arms Park, Blues have lost away games against Ireland's four provinces, followed by the loss in Italy that Wilson described as "diabolical" and "embarrassing".
Wilson reiterated his assertion that Blues' fortunes can only be improved by a long-term "project" after seasons in which predecessors Phil Davies and Mark Hammett departed.
He says wing Cuthbert, whose form for Wales has been criticised, has returned to Blues keen to impress.
"Alex trained really well and was extremely enthusiastic about what we were doing, and it was good to see him back and I'm looking forward to seeing him put the jersey on," said Wilson.
"But at the moment, like a lot of this squad, I'm yet to work with Alex over a period of time.
"I've yet to see him perform for a Blues team that I'm coaching."

The return of the six Scotland caps means there are 20 internationals in the Glasgow squad and 15 full international caps in the visitors' starting line-up.
Hogg returns at full-back, with Tommy Seymour moving to the left wing in place of Sean Lamont.
Australia international Taqele Naiyaravoro comes in for Lee Jones on the opposite side.
Bennett returns to makes his first Warriors appearance since March, with Richie Vernon not involved this weekend.
Russell replaces Duncan Weir at fly-half and Grayson Hart comes in for Mike Blair at scrum-half.
Gray captains the side for the first time since being named club captain.
Strauss returns at blind-side flanker, while Chris Fusaro is at open-side and Adam Ashe starts at number eight, with Simone Favaro not involved this weekend and Ryan Wilson moving to the bench.
Ryan Grant returns from injury and is named among the replacements.
Warriors head coach Gregor Townsend said: "We once again welcome back another group of Scotland internationals, which means competition within our squad is increasing all the time."
