Gerard John Mulligan, 44, from Lisburn, is accused of killing his father, Gerald Mulligan.
The victim's body was discovered in the vehicle in Limehurst Way on Monday.
A detective told the court that the accused "does admit to striking in some way his father with a breeze block, whether that was intentional or not".
Mr Mulligan was arrested shortly after his father's body was found.
Lisburn Magistrates' Court heard that after the pensioner's death, the accused took drugs and called his partner.
A detective said he told the woman: "I've murdered my dad... and he's in the boot of the (Vauxhall) Tigra."
Mr Mulligan applied for bail but it was refused.
He is due to appear in court again on 24 October.
