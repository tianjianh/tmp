[SN]TITLE[SN]
Study to determine if people can 'smell' Parkinson's disease

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A study is being carried out to establish if people in the early stages of Parkinson's emit a particular smell.

Researchers will examine 200 people after a Scottish woman claimed she could detect people with Parkinson's.
Joy Milne's husband Les died earlier this year after being diagnosed with Parkinson's 20 years ago.
In an early test, Mrs Milne, from Perth, managed to identify six people with the disease and six people without just from T-shirts they had slept in.

Researchers now believe Parkinson's may cause a change in the sebum - an oily substance in the skin - that results in a unique and subtle odour on the skin, only detectable by people with an acute sense of smell.
The charity Parkinson's UK is now funding researchers in Edinburgh, Manchester and London to study 200 people with and without Parkinson's.
They hope to confirm findings from a pilot study by the universities of Manchester and Edinburgh involving 24 people, which suggested that Parkinson's can be identified by odour alone.
One in 500 people in the UK has Parkinson's, which can leave people struggling to walk, speak and sleep.
It has no cure or definitive diagnostic test, and 127,000 people in the UK live with the condition.
Prof Perdita Barran, one of those who will carry out the research, said: "The sampling of the skin surface will provide a rich source of metabolites which we can mine to distinguish healthy patients from those in the early stages of Parkinson's.
"We are excited to embark on this biomarker discovery project.  It is hoped that these results could lead to the development of a non-invasive diagnostic test that may have the ability to diagnose early Parkinson's - possibly even before physical symptoms occur."
