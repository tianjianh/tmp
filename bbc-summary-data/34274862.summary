[SN]TITLE[SN]
Labour's leaders in Wales and Westminster meet

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
It was a positive, if brief, encounter. On Wednesday evening, Welsh First Minister Carwyn Jones met the newly-elected Jeremy Corbyn for the first time.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
It was seen, as you might expect, as an introductory meeting, squeezed into the diary on a busy day at Westminster. (Earlier, Mr Corbyn made his debut as Labour leader at prime minister's questions, having spent part of the morning answering questions about not singing God Save The Queen).
The meeting took place behind closed doors, with no filming allowed. I'm told it focused on three issues: next year's elections in Wales, Labour party reform (moving to a more federal structure?) and the constitution (Mr Corbyn now has a shadow minister for the constitutional convention).
I asked the first minister if having a more left-wing leader would help or hinder the chances of a party that lost seats to the Conservatives last May.
"In the election, I'll be leading the campaign with help from colleagues in London who are welcome to help but its's a Welsh election, a Welsh manifesto. Welsh Labour will produce that. That would be true of whoever was leader here in London and has been true in years gone by."
I asked if we should expect Mr Corbyn would be involved in Welsh Labour's campaign. "Of course, he will. We welcome support from our colleagues elsewhere in the UK"
Earlier, another senior MP made her question time debut in a new role. Shadow Welsh Secretary Nia Griffith used her first appearance at Welsh Questions since promotion to ask about cuts in tax credits.
Newport East MP Jessica Morden escaped the whips' office to act as Ms Griffith's deputy although a full-time appointment has yet to be made.
