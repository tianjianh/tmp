[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Met Office has issued a yellow "be aware" warning for heavy rain for the Western Isles on Friday.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Forecasters have said more than 20mm of rain could fall. The warning covers 03:00 until 15:00 on Friday.
Because of high soil saturation levels, the downpours could lead to flooding.
The Met Office said: "An unseasonable depression will approach north west Scotland on Friday and is expected to bring more than 20mm of rain to the Western Isles."
It added: "Given high soil moisture levels, this could lead to some disruption. Rain will ease later on Friday, but will continue on and off into Saturday.
"However, by then intensity will be lower."
