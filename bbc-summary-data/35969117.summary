Blackpool Council to launch crackdown on unruly bedsit tenants

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
New measures to tackle anti-social behaviour caused by people living in Blackpool bedsits are to be introduced by the town's council.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
From July a new landlord scheme in the town centre will force property owners to control unruly tenants in homes with multiple occupation (HMOs).
The scheme, featuring 700 HMOs, aims to crack down on drug dealing, rubbish dumping and neglected houses.
Blackpool Council approved the plans on Monday.
The licensing scheme will cover an area between Blackpool Football Club at the south end of the town, through the central Gateway area bordered by Seasiders Way and Central Drive, taking in the town centre to Talbot Road at the north end.
It will stretch inland as far as Devonshire Road.
The new licence will also require landlords to demand references before letting their properties.
They could be fined if they breach the conditions of the licence, which will cost from Â£670 to Â£940 for a five-year period.
