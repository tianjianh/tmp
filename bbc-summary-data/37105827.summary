There were reports linking Smith, 29, with a move back to the club with which he started his career.
"Players have agents and managers and if it suits them to put things in the press that's what happens," Cunningham told BBC Radio Merseyside.
"Matty is a good player but isn't on the radar. It was a bit of a shock when we saw what was in the press."
Cunningham, 39, added: "We've got to have a plan A, B, C, to Z because that's just the way the game is these days.
"They have got to be the right calibre of player and the right fit for the squad. We're not looking for short-term fixes."
