Bob Bradley: Swansea City boss will not consider his position

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Swansea City boss Bob Bradley says he has no intention of stepping down despite their poor Premier League form.

The Swans lost 3-0 to Middlesbrough on Saturday and are second from bottom.
Swansea have conceded 37 goals, more than any other team in the league this season, and 18 of those have been since the American replaced Francesco Guidolin in October.
"When I came here I knew what I was getting into and I'm not backing down from it now," said Bradley.
"That's the challenge. When the team has put itself in a tough spot, everybody has got to stick together during the toughest times and fight the fight," he added.
"I put pressure on myself to see if we can get stronger and fight for points. I will continue to do that.

Bradley says fighting back after conceding in the Premier League is getting harder, as his side let in three goals in 90 minutes for the second time in three days after their 3-1 defeat by West Bromwich Albion on Wednesday.
"It's the same story. We start ok, but concede. Before we know it we're 2-0 down," he added.
Swansea face West Ham on Boxing Day before playing Bournemouth on New Year's Eve and Bradley knows his side have a difficult festive period ahead after their Teesside defeat.
"I feel as though we put ourselves in a hole over and over and that takes a lot of out of a team," he continued.
"It's been more a case of on-the-road matches and now we have two very big home games coming up and turn all our attention to them."
