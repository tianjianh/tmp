A lifeboat crew went to the aid of a 92-year-old woman after she was injured in her home on a remote sea shore in Wester Ross.

The closest an ambulance could get to her house at Fernaig was a mile, after she had her accident on Sunday.
Kyle of Lochalsh RNLI launched its lifeboat at 19:40 and was at the scene within 10 minutes.
Because of the choppy sea conditions, the crew carried her on a stretcher down a track to a coastguard 4x4.
The woman, who was thought to have fractured a hip, was then driven to the ambulance.
A spokesman for Kyle of Lochalsh RNLI said: "The lifeboat put two crew members ashore to liaise with the paramedics and coastguard teams.
"It was decided that due to the choppy sea conditions along with the wet and cold weather and age of the casualty, it was best not to evacuate her by sea.
"Therefore, the casualty was loaded into the lifeboat stretcher before being slowly transported down the rough road in the back of a coastguard off-road vehicle.
"The lifeboat crew assisted with the transport and transfer into the ambulance, before making their way back along the road to the shore and the waiting lifeboat."
