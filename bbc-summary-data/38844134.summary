Driver Joshua Dobby admits manslaughter over Penge deaths

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A driver who ran over and killed a child actor and his aunt during a police pursuit has admitted manslaughter.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Joshua Dobby, 23, knocked over Makayah McDermott, 10, and Rozanne Cooper, 34, in Penge, south London, on 31 August.
He had previously admitted causing death by dangerous driving but denied manslaughter.
Sentencing will take place on 10 March. He changed his plea while appearing at the Old Bailey via videolink.
Dobby had told the court he acknowledged the "pain and suffering" he had caused.
Makayah had recently auditioned for a part in a television series.
His agent Sam Brown described him as "an extremely talented young actor" and "joy to be around".
Dobby also pleaded guilty to causing serious injury to Makayah's sister by dangerous driving.
When he first appeared before magistrates in Bromley last September, the court heard Dobby had a "very long previous criminal record" including aggravated vehicle-taking.
He was brought before the courts just two months before the deaths of Makayah and his aunt and was on licence when he killed them, the court was told.
The court heard Dobby had been advised to expect a "severe sentence".
