The group's latest album My Universe became the fastest-selling UK country album in history when it was released earlier this month.
The Shires have now signed to the Nashville-based Big Machine Label, which is under the Dot Records imprint.
The label's president and CEO is Scott Borchetta, who is widely credited with launching Swift's career.
Can The Shires sell country back to America?
Other country music artists signed to the label include Tim McGraw, Florida Georgia Line and Thomas Rhett.
The Shires - made up of Ben Earle and Crissie Rhodes - said they "can't wait to get started".
"The UK is our home and we are proud of our success so far, but it's always been a massive goal for us to build our presence and make a name for ourselves in the USA," they said.
"Scott was one of the first people to approach us as a band, after hearing our original demos nearly three years ago. His advice back then was clear, to break the UK first and come to the US with a story.
"We took his advice and are extremely excited to be working with him and his team in the US. It is the home of country music."
Borchetta said: "I've been watching The Shires closely and from afar, and now the time is right to have them join the family. I can't wait for America to experience The Shires."
The label boss signed Taylor Swift after meeting her when she was 14.
She went on to become hugely successful around the world with a string of country-tinged pop albums.
