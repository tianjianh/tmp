Officers were called to Donkey Hill in St Ann's at about 15:50 BST on Tuesday after reports of a dispute outside a takeaway and a loud bang.
Nottinghamshire Police want to speak to a man seen on CCTV who may have an injured foot and the occupants of a blue Ford Focus.
Thorneywood Mount was closed for more than 20 hours while forensics officers examined the scene.
Det Insp Mike Allen said: "Despite no-one being found injured at the scene, extensive CCTV inquiries indicate that someone was hurt - although the injuries are not believed to be life-threatening - and we are in the process of trying to trace the victim."
