GrabTaxi angers with breast cancer campaign

South East Asian taxi-booking app GrabTaxi has been criticised for a controversial breast cancer awareness campaign.

Under the slogan "LOVE BOOBS? So does cancer" the company hoped to sell T-shirts bearing the same words, to raise money for cancer charities.
It also created a social media hashtag, #GrabItBeatIt.
Criticised as sexist and insensitive, the firm has said sorry for the taglines.
The campaign is running in several countries, including Singapore, Indonesia, the Philippines and Malaysia, where it is known as MyTeksi.
"We apologise that it comes across as insensitive to breast cancer survivors, their families and the wider public. Breast cancer is not a trivial issue and we regret that the taglines are not reflective of the seriousness of the issue," the company's Singapore division said.
But while it has removed an online promotional video for the campaign - entitled "What if BOOBS didn't exist?" - it has not ended the campaign nor removed the slogan from cars carrying it during Breast Cancer Awareness Month.
In a series of tweets, Grab Taxi Singapore also defended the hashtag, which it says was aimed at getting women to examine their own breasts for signs of cancer.
While the campaign - and the app notifications sent out as part of it - certainly gained attention, it was not all positive.
Twitter user @mintea commented: "I find the Grabtaxi boob sms distasteful. I think family history of boob cancer might have something to do with it."
While Faizal Hamssin tweeted: "It's unfortunate that your Breast Cancer campaign is communicated in a sexist way that objectifies women."
Cancer charities will receive the proceeds of T-shirts GrabTaxi is selling.
In Singapore, they are priced at 15 Singapore dollars ($11; Â£7) and the proceeds go to the Singapore Cancer Society, which is also using the #GrabItBeatIt hashtag on its Facebook page, though they have reportedly distanced themselves from the running of GrabTaxi's campaign.
