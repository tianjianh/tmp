Former Wales number eight Andy Powell has retired from professional rugby because of a knee injury.

The 35-year-old started his career with Newport and had spells with Leicester, Scarlets, Cardiff Blues, Wasps and Newport Gwent Dragons among others.
Powell made his Wales debut in 2008 and won the last of his 23 caps in 2012.
He earned notoriety in 2010 when he was charged with drink driving after allegedly taking and driving a golf buggy on the M4 motorway.
Powell toured South Africa with the British and Irish Lions in 2009 but did not make a Test appearance.
He had a spell with rugby league team Wigan between 2013 and 2014, before returning to union with the Dragons.
Powell joined Merthyr in the Welsh Championship in 2015 and helped them win promotion to the Premiership.
"Andy's found it hard to get over his current knee injury and will not be forgotten. He was a big part of our success last season as captain," said Merthyr chairman Peter Morgan.
"Andy had plenty of time for everyone he will be sadly missed on the field and off, but will always be welcome to our club."
