The Scot came through 6-3 6-2 6-1 on Centre Court and goes on to face Australia's John Millman, who beat French 26th seed Benoit Paire.
Lu, the Taiwanese world number 76, had won 11 matches in a row on grass and began with a break of serve.
However, second seed Murray responded by winning 17 of the next 20 games to seal victory in an hour and 40 minutes.
"The first set was tough," said 29-year-old world number two Murray, who beat Lu on his way to winning the title in 2013. "There were a lot of close games.
"I managed to hang on at the end of the first set, settled down towards the end of the second, and was hitting the ball much better in third and feeling more comfortable.
"If you can win matches easily it does help because you can rest. It has been a good start.
"I will just try and do my best - work hard, keep my head down and hopefully have a good tournament."
Lu only returned after elbow surgery in May but quickly found some impressive form, winning 15 of 16 matches on grass, and he began in impressive fashion.
The 32-year-old broke Murray's serve in the opening game and impressed at the beginning and end of the first set, but could not contain Murray in full flow.
A poor drop shot from Murray offered up that early break but the same stroke would help him level at 3-3, and go on to repeatedly leave Lu flat-footed.
As Lu's opening burst faded and his first-serve percentage dropped, Murray began to take control of the rallies, forcing two forehand errors on his way to a 5-3 lead.
There was one further bout of resistance from Lu, but Murray saw off two break points before clinching the set and accelerated towards round three.
Over the course of the second and third sets he reeled off 23 winners, broke serve five times and dropped only 11 points on serve as Lu succumbed with a double fault on match point.
Pat Cash, 1987 Wimbledon champion and BBC Radio 5 live analyst
"It was an impressive win. Lu threw everything at him, but Murray was rock solid. In the third set he loosened up and played really well.
"John Millman, who he plays in the third round, is a solid player but I don't think he has the power of Lu. So it will be more of the same for Murray.
"It is all going exactly according to plan for him so far in these Championships."
