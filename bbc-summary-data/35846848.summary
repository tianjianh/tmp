[SN]TITLE[SN]
Tory MPs to vote with Labour in EU 'solar tax' protest

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Conservative Eurosceptics are to join forces with Labour to try and defeat the government over changes to VAT on home insulation and renewable energy.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
At least 12 Tories are backing a Labour motion opposing any rise in VAT charged on solar panels, wind turbines, draught installation and energy-saving devices.
The current 5% rate paid by benefit claimants over 60 was ruled illegal by the European Court of Justice in June.
It is one of several tax rows in the spotlight ahead of the EU referendum.
In the wake of Wednesday's Budget, UK officials said EU leaders had agreed a deal to allow the UK to scrap the so-called "tampon tax", the 5% VAT rate on women's sanitary products which campaigners have long wanted to reduce to zero.
The European Commission is set to publish proposals next week on giving member states more flexibility over VAT rates.
Eurosceptics have long been critical of rules in force since the early 1990s harmonising VAT rates across the EU, arguing they undermine national sovereignty and the right of member states to set their own tax rates.
The UK and other EU members cannot levy sales tax at less than the standard 15% rate except on specified items. For these approved products and services, countries have the scope to charge VAT at a reduced rate of no less than 5%.
The UK has long applied a 5% rate to the installation of domestic energy-saving products for anyone over the age of 60 who is unemployed, disabled or claiming benefits such as income support or housing benefit.
But last year, the European Court of Justice said this was a breach of EU laws as the products and services concerned did not fall within the VAT directive which only exempts the "provision, construction, renovation and alteration of housing as part of social policy" and the "renovation and repairing of private dwellings".
The UK has yet to decide how to respond to the ruling although it face financial penalties if it does not abide by the judgement.
Labour says VAT could rise to at least 15% as early as August unless the chancellor takes immediate action.
The opposition, which has been critical of cuts to solar and renewable subsidies, has tabled an amendment to the Finance Bill "empowering" George Osborne to set a zero rates on insulation and renewable materials or, alternatively, to compensate the industry for the financial impact that any VAT rise would have on jobs and investment.
Labour's shadow energy and climate change secretary Lisa Nandy said the "solar tax" will "destroy thousands of jobs".
"Reversing it is well within the chancellor's power. He must act to protect this important British industry."
Labour's amendment, expected to come to a vote on Tuesday, has won the support of a dozen Tories who are unhappy about EU control over UK tax rates and seeking to highlight the issue in the run-up to June's EU referendum.
Those backing it include former ministers Tim Loughton and Peter Lilley and Graham Brady, chair of the influential 1922 committee of backbench Conservatives - all of whom want the UK to leave the EU.
Paul Scully, the MP for Sutton and Cheam who is backing EU exit, told the BBC's Daily Politics the situation was "absolutely outrageous" and he was "seriously considering" voting with Labour.
"At the end of the day this should be a UK-made decision," he said.
"You have a situation where we can look at a sugar tax, where we penalising people for doing something the government does not believe is right, but we can't reward the government for doing something we think is the right thing to do."
If the SNP and the Lib Dems also support the amendment, the government could be at risk of defeat as it only has a working majority of 17 in the House of Commons.
