'Super Blood Moon' sits over Kelpies

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Stargazers in Scotland have been treated to a good view of Sunday night's lunar eclipse and "supermoon".

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A supermoon occurs when the Moon is in its closest part of orbit to Earth, making it appear larger in the sky.
Added to this, an eclipse made it appear "blood" red - as it passed over Scottish landmarks, including the giant Kelpies.
From the UK, observers saw the Moon pass through the Earth's shadow in the early hours of Monday morning.
This phenomenon of the lunar eclipse and "supermoon" together was last observed in 1982 and will not come again until 2033.
