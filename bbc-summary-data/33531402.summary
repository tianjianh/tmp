Eton College has apologised after sending an email offering a conditional place to hundreds of pupils in error.

The elite college said it "deeply regrets" the system error which led to an email meant for just nine families being sent to a total of 400 recipients.
Those who wrongly received the conditional offer were hoping to attend the school from September 2017.
An internal review is now taking place.
Boys are offered conditional places to Eton College after they have passed an interview, aged 11.
They must then pass the Common Entrance exam in order to confirm their place.
A college spokesman said: "This error was discovered within minutes and each family was immediately contacted to notify them that it should be disregarded.
"We take this type of incident very seriously indeed so a thorough investigation, overseen by the head master Tony Little and led by the tutor for admissions, is being carried out to find out exactly what went wrong and to ensure it cannot happen again.
"Eton College offers its sincere apologies to those boys concerned and their families.
"We deeply regret the confusion and upset this must have caused."
The school in Berkshire was founded 575 years ago and has fees of more than Â£34,000 a year for some students.
Prime Minister David Cameron and Princes William and Harry attended the renowned boarding school.
