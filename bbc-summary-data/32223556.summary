Teenagers will be guaranteed face-to-face individual careers advice if Labour forms the next government.

The party's education manifesto also includes a pledge "to protect the entire education budget in real terms".
"A world-class education is a not a luxury, but a necessity," said Labour leader Ed Miliband.
In December, Education Secretary Nicky Morgan announced Â£20m to set up a new careers company to forge links between schools and businesses in England.
The move followed concerns that careers advice deteriorated after schools took over responsibility for it from local councils in 2012.
Labour says its plan would focus on vocational as well as on academic routes into careers, with the aim of raising standards and increasing opportunities for all young people.
The new proposals would cost approximately Â£50m and would be funded and supported through a partnership between universities, schools, colleges and employers, says Labour.
The party quotes the CBI as having described careers advice in schools as being on "life-support".
Too many schools offer inadequate careers advice, says Labour, often just pointing pupils towards online information.
The party says this follows "years of neglect and reductions in support under David Cameron and the Tories".
Labour promises:
The party says the proposals build on its existing plans for a Technical Baccalaureate, compulsory English and maths to 18 and an apprenticeship offer for every school leaver who gets the grades.
Main pledges
Policy guide: Where the parties stand
"Young people must be equipped with the right skills, the right knowledge and the right advice they need to succeed," said Mr Miliband.
"Failure to do this will not only cheat our young people of a decent future, it will cheat our country too."
Labour's education manifesto also includes commitments to smaller classes in infants' schools, a qualified teacher in every classroom and local directors of school standards "to tackle underachievement".
The new employer-led company announced by Mrs Morgan in December will be chaired by Christine Hodgson, of the outsourcing company Capgemini UK.
It will advise schools and colleges, link them with employers and help boost careers advice in areas where it is poor, said Mrs Morgan.
The Conservatives announced details of their education policies on Wednesday, including re-sits for pupils who get poor results in tests at the end of primary school.
The Liberal Democrats maintain that the pupil premium, which they championed in the coalition government, is the key to increasing fair access to opportunities for teenagers.
The premium is paid to schools for every pupil they have who is eligible for free school meals.
The National Union of Students said face-to-face careers advice was "essential" to help people "fully explore their options".
NUS president Toni Pearce said she welcomed Labour's commitment "wholeheartedly".
The National Association of Head Teachers agreed all children should have access to high-quality careers advice, from primary school onwards.
The union said its Primary Futures project already put "professional people into primary schools to showcase the world of work".
"All the political parties talk about improving standards in education but NAHT believes that the solutions to the problems in our schools will come from within the profession itself and not more political intervention," said general secretary, Russell Hobby.
But the Association of School and College Leaders, which primarily represents secondary heads, expressed "serious misgivings over Labour's approach", particularly over the suggestion that careers advisers would be employed centrally rather than directly through schools.
"The needs of young people in different parts of England vary enormously and cannot be met from Westminster," said ASCL general secretary Brian Lightman.
The charity Barnardo's added that it was vital to ensure that training options for disadvantaged young people with low qualifications were included in any new careers service.
