The 26-year-old recorded 365.90 points from her five dives to split the Chinese pair of 15-year-old Ren Qian (367.35) and Si Yajie (353.70).
Couch had led for four of the five rounds and was only overtaken in the closing dive by Qian.
"Sooooooo.... This just happened ..... SILVER," tweeted a delighted Couch.
Couch had previously won six world series bronze medals in the event.
The Plymouth diver's best effort came in the form of an inward three-and-a-half somersaults tuck, which saw her score 81.60, the highest scoring dive of any of the athletes except Qian.
Couch climbs to fourth in the overall 10m platform standings after the fourth and final round of the 2016 series, with Qian taking top spot.
