Officials in Mislata, near Valencia, say police will take samples of dog excrement collected by street cleaners to a local lab for analysis.
Owners have until 31 December to take their dogs to a vet so that a blood sample can be taken free of charge.
Those who fail to register their dog's DNA will face fines of €300.
Similar, but more limited, schemes exist in the US and UK.
Mislata municipality warns owners that they face a €200 fine for failure to remove their dog's mess from the pavement.
Once a dog is registered on the DNA database, the owner will get a name tag that must be worn by the dog.
Valencia has also introduced another method to keep the pavements clean: disposable cardboard tongs that allow a dog owner to remove the mess more hygienically, Spain's ABC news reports.
