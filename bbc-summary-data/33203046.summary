Japanese knotweed: The plant bringing misery to homeowners

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
It was about eight years ago when the nightmare started at the north Belfast home of Liz and Adrian Atkinson.

They had lived there for 18 years but it was only recently that they noticed a rapid growth on a bank behind their property.
It turned out to be Japanese knotweed, an invasive species brought to these shores by 19th century botanists.
It had evolved to survive on the slopes of volcanoes in Japan.
But, over here, it's getting out of control.
It's fast-growing and difficult to kill. It can punch through concrete, doing damage to house foundations and drainage.
The species is so destructive that banks are refusing mortgages for those who have it on or near their property.
The plant is now encroaching into the Atkinson's garden.
Adrian has a disability which may mean that the couple could need to move out of their two-storey house.
But now they fear they won't be able to sell it.
"It's a huge worry, it really is devastating," said Liz. "We've been told that it's going to affect the value of our house.
"If we need to move to a bungalow or something more suitable, we won't get this house sold."
She says it has "taken over" their life and despite letters to numerous bodies, none of them "wants to know".
The plant is resistant to ordinary methods of weed control - cutting it, digging it up or treating it with normal weedkiller only spreads it further and faster.
Even cutting the grass is a potential problem.
The root, which can grow to a depth of three metres, is considered controlled waste which must be disposed of at a licensed landfill.
Moving soil contaminated with the root without approval is an offence.
Specialist companies will treat it with heavy duty weedkiller but it's a repeat process that can take up to seven years, and cost several thousand pounds.
Chris Kenton, the environmental spokesperson for the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, says Japanese knotweed can jeopardise mortgage applications.
"A number of lenders have identified Japanese knotweed as a 'decline' so if a valuer identifies it on the property or even on a neighbouring property, that will cause that mortgage to be declined."
He said he personally recommended refusal on three properties in the past 18 months because of the plant and he knows of another client whose re-mortgage application was refused because of it.
