Jose Mourinho: Man Utd manager watches West Ham win from 'secret location'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Manchester United manager Jose Mourinho would not divulge where he watched his team's 4-1 win over West Ham in the EFL Cup quarter-finals on Wednesday.

Mourinho, 53, was given a one-match touchline ban on the same day after being sent off in Sunday's Premier League game against the Hammers.
However, he did not sit in the Old Trafford stands for the cup tie, instead staying out of view.
"It's a secret. I was in contact with the bench," said the Portuguese.
Mourinho was seen arriving at Old Trafford for the quarter-final tie, and was seen waiting to shake Hammers boss Slaven Bilic's hand in the tunnel moments before kick-off.
He then disappeared into the Sir Bobby Charlton Stand and did not appear outside.
Mourinho's ban only covered the touchline and technical area, meaning he could have sat in the stand if he wished.
It was not a total stadium ban like the one he was given by the Football Association before a trip to Stoke in 2015, or by Uefa for the 2005 Champions League tie against Bayern Munich.
"On Tuesday, we worked really well and everybody was prepared," he said.
"At half-time I could be face-to-face with the players and on top of that I trust my assistants to pass on the information we need.
"I'm really happy with the players."
Bastian Schweinsteiger's career at Manchester United appeared to be over after being told to train away from the first team following Mourinho's arrival in the summer.
The Red Devils manager had a change of heart at the start of this month, saying it was a "human and professional decision" to allow the former Germany midfielder to rejoin first-team training.
And the World Cup winner's turnaround was completed when he was introduced as an 85th-minute substitute against the Hammers.
The 32-year-old's introduction was greeted with a standing ovation from the 65,269 crowd and arguably the biggest cheer of the night.
