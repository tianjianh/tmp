[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Peter Robinson told Stormont's Finance Committee Frank Cushnahan introduced him to the Pimco investment fund.
Nama said it was not made aware, either by Mr Cushnahan or any other source, about the meeting in May 2013.
Mr Cushnahan resigned as a Nama adviser in November 2013 to work for Pimco.
He was in line to receive a Â£5m fee if Pimco's bid for the portfolio had been successful, the Irish Parliament has been told.
The bid collapsed in March 2014 when Nama learned of Mr Cushnahan's role.

Timeline of Nama's Northern Ireland property deal
The National Asset Management Agency, or Nama, is the Republic of Ireland's state-owned so-called 'bad bank', set up to take control of property loans made by the country's banks before the property crash in 2008.
Last year, Nama sold its entire portfolio of Northern Ireland loans to US investment firm Cerberus for Â£1.24bn.
Nama said that Mr Cushnahan never made any disclosure of an interest relating to Pimco or its possible interest in bidding for the portfolio.
It added that members of its Northern Ireland advisory committee were under an obligation to "disclose any pecuniary or beneficial interest in, and material to, any matter that fell to be considered by the committee".
Mr Cushnahan has denied any wrongdoing in relation to the Nama deal.
Earlier on Wednesday, Mr Robinson told the finance committee it was for others to decide if Mr Cushnahan had a conflict of interest.
He said he was "not sure" if there had been a conflict in relation to the initial meeting.
Mr Robinson said he did not know about the proposed fee for Mr Cushnahan until Nama told the Irish parliament about it in July this year.
He added that he was "not sure that anybody comes to ministers and puts all their cards on the table about what their interests are".
