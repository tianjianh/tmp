[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man has admitted sex offences involving a teenage girl with learning difficulties.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Christopher Woakes, 31, contacted a number of underage girls on social media, Ipswich Crown Court heard.
He sent a 15-year-old girl explicit images of himself before meeting her near her home, where he engaged in sexual activity with her.
Woakes, of Portbury Grove, Bristol, admitted sexual grooming and two counts of sexual activity with a child.
He was remanded in custody and is due to be sentenced on 23 May.
The court heard he encouraged the teenager from Suffolk in August to tell her parents she was meeting a teenage boy.
'Emotional neediness'
They became suspicious and alerted the police.
Woakes' true identity came to light in November when he repeatedly tried to contact the girl, sending her a mobile phone through the post and loitering outside her home.
He was arrested at his home address in Bristol and a number of computers and devices were seized.
Analysis of his computers and phones by Suffolk Police uncovered a number of illegal images of children.
They also found Woakes had tried to contact children in a number of countries.
Det Con Matthew Ross of Suffolk Police said: "Sexual predators will target a child's vulnerabilities looking for signs of emotional neediness and low self-confidence.
"Online social media platforms provide a place for a lot of this to happen in private especially where the child's activity is not closely monitored."
