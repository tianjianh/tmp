One of the winning stars was female rapper Paradise.
Dressed in a revealing black gown and diamond necklace, she performed her latest song, an impassioned denunciation of violence against women.
The hard-hitting lyrics cover taboo subjects like rape, domestic violence and self-immolation.
"Unfortunately women in Afghanistan face lots of troubles and we sing to give them a voice," Paradise told the BBC.
