Poortown Quarry 'best solution' for Peel Marina silt

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Poortown Quarry is the best place for 18,000 tonnes of dredged silt from Peel Marina, the Manx government has said.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Work began on the seven-week project on Monday but some residents say there has been a lack of consultation.
Infrastructure Minister Phil Gawne it is the best temporary solution which is "safe, practical and controlled".
German Parish Commissioners have called a public meeting at St John's Methodist Hall on Thursday and invited Mr Gawne to attend.
A spokesman for the Commissioners said they were "very disappointed" that the work has commenced before any "meaningful public consultation".
They said residents had been alarmed when "potentially hazardous waste" was spilled on roads and pavements around Peel from lorries.
Mr Gawne said it is "collected river sediment" and not some sort of "toxic waste."
He said the project to dredge the multi-million pound Marina has been "urgently needed since 2011."
"Effectively we had three options; do nothing and allow Peel marina to close; dump large quantities of silt at sea and risk valuable commercial fisheries; or progress a properly engineered facility on land owned by the Department."
He said the Poortown Quarry site was chosen after detailed analysis of several land-based options.
The silt is being transferred by lorry to the pit, which is lined with an impervious membrane.
The Department of Infrastructure said it was preparing a retrospective planning application.
Both the site and run-off will be "carefully monitored", a government spokesman said, adding that they are working to find a "permanent solution".
It is believed Peel Marina generates the government about Â£30,000 a year.
