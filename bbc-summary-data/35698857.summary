Shahzaib died in hospital on Monday after he was struck by a car on Moss Street West in Ashton-under-Lyne, Greater Manchester.
Three men aged 19, 23 and 27 have been arrested on suspicion of causing death by dangerous driving.
Javid Hussain said his son was "always happy and jolly".
Mr Hussain said they were walking home from the mosque when the collision occurred.
"We'd just said our prayers and my son was in front of me, just a few steps away.
"He'd not even put his foot on the footpath and he was hurled into the air."
Prayers were held for him on Monday night.
A car thought to have been involved in the crash was found later by police and is being forensically examined.
