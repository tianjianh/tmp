American football star Johnny Manziel has been charged with assaulting his ex-girlfriend.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Mr Manziel is accused of hitting and threatening to kill Colleen Crowley during a night out in January.
The former Cleveland Browns quarterback is expected to plead not guilty. If convicted he faces up to a year in jail and a $4,000 (Â£2,750) fine.
The Browns dropped him from the team after poor play on the field and bad headlines off.
Despite success playing football as a university student, Mr Manziel - nicknamed "Johnny Football" - has struggled with substance abuse and has had a spell in a rehabilitation centre.
An indictment accuses him of striking Ms Crowley and "forcing [her] into a vehicle and against a vehicle dashboard".
She accused her former partner of hitting her so hard she lost her hearing, according to the indictment.
The National Football League (NFL) has toughened its policies on domestic violence after criticism that another player, Ray Rice, received only a two-game ban for assaulting his then-fiance.
The move could complicate any effort by Mr Manziel to return to the game.
