Louis van Gaal: Man Utd not planning any panic signings

Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal says he will not make any panic signings before the transfer window closes on Tuesday.

United lost 2-1 at Swansea on Sunday and have scored just three goals in four league games.
"You can never speak as a club like Manchester United that you are satisfied," Van Gaal said.
But the Dutchman added: "We shall not buy another player that we have not scouted before."
Van Gaal has spent around £80m on players this summer, including the £31m signing of Netherlands forward Memphis Depay, but after selling Robin van Persie to Fenerbahce and not replacing Radamel Falcao, he is short of striking options.
Captain Wayne Rooney scored a hat-trick in a comfortable Champions League win over Club Brugge in midweek but has not scored in the Premier League since April and wasted several good chances at the Liberty Stadium.
United, who are five points behind leaders Manchester City, continue to be linked with several strikers but Van Gaal does not expect any last-minute moves.
"We have to keep on and in January the windows are open again. It is a process. I cannot change that process.

"You are dependable not only on the player you want but the club - and also what you want to spend. It is a lot of things you cannot force."
Goalkeeper David De Gea was again not involved as the Spain international continues to be linked with a move to Real Madrid.
The Spanish transfer window closes at midnight on Monday - 18 hours before the English window shuts at 18:00 BST on Tuesday - but Van Gaal said he was not involved in any negotiations.
"We have to wait and see but I don't want to interfere," he said.
"As a manager we have divided our tasks and the task is for [United executive vice-chairman] Ed Woodward and not for me."
United's poor attacking display at the Liberty Stadium prompted former captain Gary Neville to urge action in the transfer market.
The England coach said on Sky Sports: "If Javier Hernandez leaves, they've got one striker. I'm not classing Marouane Fellaini as a striker. They've got one striker in Wayne Rooney.
"From Manchester United's point of view, they have to resolve the centre-forward and the goalkeeper situation in the next two days.
"I would have said, having let Jonny Evans go, they need a centre-back as well but to do three pieces in the next 48 hours I think will be nigh-on impossible.
"But I'd be absolutely staggered if there wasn't a striker brought in. It has to happen."
