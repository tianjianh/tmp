Police have issued a warning to the public after the incident in Castle Douglas on Thursday.
The woman was contacted by someone claiming to be from the Visa Fraud Unit over suspicious account activity.
She was asked to transfer funds to another account to "protect" them but when she did so the money was taken and the scam completed.
Det Insp Dean Little said: "More and more we are finding that those carrying out these scams are becoming increasingly proficient and professional in the way they come across to those whom they target.
"The public need to be alert to anyone who calls them out of the blue and take time to think about what it is that the caller is asking them.
"Our advice is to note details and before taking any action on that first call, stop and think, and even discuss with friends or relatives what it is the caller is requesting."
He also stressed that personal details or details of account numbers should never be discussed over the telephone.
