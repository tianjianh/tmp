The 46-year-old from North Berwick has played in eight Solheim Cups, earning 19 points from 33 matches.
Matthew, who is in the Great Britain team at the Rio Olympics, will assist Annika Sorenstam.
"It's a great honour as she's probably the best woman golfer there's ever been and I'm really looking forward to it," said Matthew.
Matthew could potentially make her ninth Solheim Cup appearance as a playing vice-captain at the event from 14-20 August next year.
She added: "It's a long way off still but it's a possibility. I'll see how I'm playing next year and go from there.
"I love the Solheim Cup and it's my favourite week each time it comes round every two years. It's just so different for a golfer to be in a team environment where you've got your team-mates and the captains and vice-captains.
"Golf is such an individual sport that it just makes it great fun. I've got great memories from it."
The USA are the current holders of the Solheim Cup after winning 14½-13½ in Germany last year.
The 2019 Solheim Cup will be returning to Scotland at Gleneagles.
