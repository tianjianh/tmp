A man caught at Edinburgh Airport with knives, knuckledusters and CS gas canisters in his luggage has been jailed for three years.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Kevin McKell, from Dundee, had returned from a visit to Bavaria when his suitcase set off alarms going through an X-Ray machine.
McKell, 31. told security staff that he had a knuckle duster and a knife.
But a check revealed three CS gas canisters, seven knives and 10 knuckledusters.
Edinburgh Sheriff Court was told that the items were "readily available" in Bavaria and that McKell was bringing them back for friends.
McKell admitted possessing the weapons without reasonable excuse or lawful authority at Edinburgh Airport on 1 June last year.
