Macaulay Culkin has been booed off stage at a concert with his band The Pizza Underground in Nottingham.

The group, who play Velvet Underground songs with pizza-themed lyrics and kazoo solos, also had pints of beer thrown at them.
"Why are you throwing those?" Culkin asked the crowd at the Rock City venue. "I'd rather drink them."
According to reports, the band lasted only 15 minutes before being forced to flee the stage.
"Thank you so much Nottingham," they tweeted later. "Sorry that a couple [of] people ruined it for everyone."
Their show in Nottingham was part of the Dot to Dot festival - meaning audience members may not have known what to expect from the act.
But audience member Patrick Mendes was unrepentant.
"I'm glad I lobbed a pint and I'm glad it hit you," he wrote on the group's Facebook page.
Complaining about their "mockery" of "one of the greatest bands of all time", he added: "Great art should never be compromised".
Another fan told the Nottingham Post: "It just sounds awful. I can't believe he is doing this. Why bother? It must go down well in America or something."
But not everyone was so hostile.
"I for one enjoyed pizza underground at dot to dot yesterday," tweeted Hannah on Monday. "They gave the crowd pizza... what more do you people want?"
"May I apologise on behalf of the Nottingham folk," wrote Mark Chadwick on Facebook. "Was loving you guys, and the free pizza! So so sorry, would love to have you back."
Culkin, 33, is best known for his childhood role as Kevin McCallister in the Home Alone film series.
He joined The Pizza Underground in 2012, performing parody songs such as Take a Bite of the Wild Slice (Lou Reed's Walk on the Wild Side) and All The Pizza Parties (Velvet Underground's All Tomorrow's Parties).
The quintet has a percussionist who plays a pizza box and they often hand out slices of pizza to their audience.
They met a similar reception on the Manchester leg of the festival, where pint glasses were again thrown and the gig ended abruptly after a stage invasion.
Manchester blogger Frankie Buttons, who saw the gig, tweeted her disappointment.
"Things that are cool: Macaulay Culkin! Things that are not cool: throwing glasses at Macaulay Culkin!
"Manchester you disappoint me."
The organisers of the Dot to Dot festival said: "It's such a shame that some members of the crowd had to ruin what was set to be an excellent show. A sentiment echoed by the band themselves.
"Hopefully they'll get to play in Nottingham again one day soon."
