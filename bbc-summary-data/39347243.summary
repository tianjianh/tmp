[SN]TITLE[SN]
Solihull Moors 0-1 Torquay United

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Daniel Sparkes' late winner earned Torquay a win at Solihull that moved the Gulls out of the National League relegation zone.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Sparkes struck with two minutes left to lift United above Woking and into 20th place after a first win in four games.
After a low-key first period, Ruairi Keating was denied an opener as he drove straight at home goalkeeper Nathan Baxter.
Baxter also kept out Jamie Reid's long-range effort, but he was beaten in the 88th minute when Sparkes headed in from close range.
Sparkes left the match in stoppage time on a stretcher following a challenge by Regan Charles-Cook that earned the Solihull defender a red card.
