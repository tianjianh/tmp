Lindsay Taylor, 36, and Paul McGann, 35, were at St Bennett's Primary School in Netherton, Liverpool, when they were asked to play Jesus's parents in 1985.
They met by chance on a night out last year with friends and they recognised each other instantly and began dating.
The couple are getting married on Sunday in Liverpool.
Ms Taylor said: "I remember Paul had a bowl haircut, he was very shy, really shy. We were just friends instantly.
"We were in the school assembly and we had to go to the front and everyone clapped as they announced our names. My name got called first and I was hoping it was going to be Paul."
Mr McGann said he was chosen because of his good behaviour.
He said: "She used to sit by me in class and used to chase me round playing kiss chase.
"We were playful boyfriend and girlfriend and then we did eventually become boyfriend and girlfriend and had a first kiss down by the back of my Mum's [house]."
"My sister Yvonne said: 'Our Paul loves you.' I went a little bit red at the time. We were about nine."
The couple lived in the same areas as teenagers, but drifted apart as they got older. Ms Taylor worked as an air stewardess for a number of years and they did not see each other for "many years."
They bumped into each other on a night out and went on a first date.
"After four months he proposed," she added. "I was so so happy because one, I  wasn't expecting it and two it is because I wanted it myself."
She added: "Every so often I have to re-think I am meeting Paul at the end of the aisle. My first love, my first kiss, my childhood sweetheart and it's going to be a very emotional day."
