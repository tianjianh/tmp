EDF, the French firm in charge of the project, has selected Rolls-Royce to supply heat exchangers worth £25m.
In partnership with Nuvia, Rolls-Royce will also supply systems to treat nuclear waste in a contract worth £75m.
Earlier this month EDF admitted that the construction of the plant has been delayed.
It said Hinkley Point C in Somerset will not start generating power in 2023 as planned.
EDF said it will provide a revised timetable for the £24.5bn plant when it takes a final investment decision on the project.
The contracts awarded to Rolls-Royce and Nuvia are subject to that final investment decision from EDF.
"Hinkley Point C offers the UK a tremendous opportunity to boost employment and skills in the crucial manufacturing and construction sectors, as well as leading the revitalisation of the new nuclear programme," Vincent de Rivaz, chief executive of EDF Energy, said in a statement.
The new nuclear plant will be built next to two existing facilities at Hinkley Point in Somerset.
