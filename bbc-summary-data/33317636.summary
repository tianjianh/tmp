Lisa Burbidge, from Whickham, Tyneside, was among 38 people killed by a gunman at a beach resort near Sousse.
Her family described her as the "most beautiful, amazing, caring and gentle person in our lives".
Flowers have been laid on the green outside St Mary's Church, where prayers have been held for Mrs Burbidge and her family.
They said in a statement: "We have been left with a massive hole in our hearts.
"She leaves behind many family members including four fantastic grandchildren who were her world and will miss her tremendously."
Local councillor Peter Craig said: "I have been in touch with friends of the family to see if we can think of a way of showing support.
"We are working on that today and consulting with them but we want to take our time rather than rush into anything."
Rev Barry Abbott, Rector of Whickham St Mary the Virgin said: "Our prayers are with the family and the community who have been greatly affected by this atrocity against humanity.
"We are here for both family and the community at this time and the church is open for prayer on weekday mornings."
