FAW chief executive Jonathan Ford says the 72,500-capacity Principality Stadium is an option.
But after Wales' run to the Euro 2016 semi-finals, Coleman wants to stay at the 33,000-seater home of Cardiff City.
"I would imagine we're going to stick to that, and we should stick to it." he said.
"We could gamble and go back to the Millennium Stadium. It is a magnificent stadium, we know that, we could get another 20,000 maybe, but we made a choice.
"I'd rather be playing at Cardiff City Stadium where there's 30,000 screaming Taffs breathing down the opposition's neck, and our boys feeding off that."
Wales will start their 2018 World Cup qualifying campaign against Moldova at Cardiff City Stadium on 5 September.
It is understood they could play a friendly match at the Principality Stadium before it hosts the 2017 Champions League final.
Wales last played at the home of Welsh rugby in a 2-0 Euro 2012 qualifier defeat by England in March, 2011.
"We've got both options available to us," said Ford.
"If the demand is there we need to satisfy that demand whether that's at the Cardiff City Stadium or the Principality Stadium. But obviously it's not available to us for every single match."
Wales' momentous European Championship campaign saw them reach the semi-finals of a major tournament for the first time.
Coleman's men lost to Portugal in the last four on Wednesday but, having won four of their six games in France, Wales exceeded expectations with a string of generation-defining performances.
Before returning to Cardiff for Friday's homecoming parade, the players enjoyed a night out on their final evening in Dinard - the coastal Brittany town where they have been based during the tournament - while Coleman and his staff were also able to unwind.
"We watched the game [France's semi-final win over Germany] and had some pizza and a few cold beers, which were welcome," he added.

"It was nice, a lovely atmosphere fair play. The local people in Dinard have given us such a welcome.
"They were playing our national anthem at the restaurant where we were. We sang that and then we sang the French national anthem.
"That whole feeling, I hope that's being projected back home, what the atmosphere has been like.
"I know there were one or two unsavoury moments at the start of the tournament but, predominantly, all we've seen is positivity from people from all different countries."
