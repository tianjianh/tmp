ScottishPower is shedding 200 jobs from its customer service departments in Scotland and southern England.

The company said it needed fewer staff now that it has completed the move to a new contact handling system.
A source said it was confident that it would achieve the target through a voluntary redundancy scheme.
The job cuts are from a customer service workforce of 1,800, spread across five sites, three of them in Glasgow and Hamilton.
A company source said: "We have started discussions with the unions and employee representatives, and there will be opportunities for around 200 people to leave the retail business over the course of 2017.
"We have always managed major change programmes through voluntary means.  Indeed, should we receive too many applications for voluntary redundancy, then we will have to prioritise according to operational requirements.
"Our last similar programme was oversubscribed. This follows the implementation of our new customer service system, which is now fully embedded."
