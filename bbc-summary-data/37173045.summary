The family were about to take the Emirates airline cable car when they said a man apparently shouted: "Jews, go back to Isra-hell".
The father, 32, who does not wish to be named, said the man shouted "quite aggressively", terrifying the children.
Police are looking into the incident which took place on Monday.
The family said they were on Western Gateway, Newham, at about 15:15 BST when they were abused.
The father said: "I heard shouting, quite aggressively, aimed towards myself and my family."
The alleged abuser was himself with two children and a woman when he shouted the abuse, he said.
The father said he told them: "Jews, go back to Isra-hell. Don't come round here, go to Stamford Hill, you're not welcome'."
Stamford Hill is an area of north London known for its strong links to the Jewish community.
The six children are aged 10, eight, seven, five, three and nine weeks.
"He continued again and again," the father added.
"He sounded very aggressive. My children all started crying, they were terrified. They were very scared and they didn't sleep that night at all.
"I don't think they will forget this very quickly. It was disgusting."
Jewish community security group Shomrim, which is supporting the family, released the footage recorded by the victim.
A Metropolitan Police spokesman said: "Detectives in Newham are investigating an allegation of anti-Semitic abuse which was reported to police on Monday, August 22."
