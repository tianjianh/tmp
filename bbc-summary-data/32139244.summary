[SN]TITLE[SN]
A4e staff jailed for DWP back-to-work training fraud

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Six employees at a back-to-work recruitment company have been jailed for a fraud that saw them falsely claim almost £300,000.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
They worked for Action 4 Employment (A4e) which helped people gain training to get into work.
They made up files, forged signatures and falsely claimed they had helped people find jobs, enabling them to hit targets and gain government bonuses.
Four more employees received suspended sentences.
Following a 13-week trial at Reading Crown Court, four people were found guilty of taking part in the fraud in January. Six others previously admitted their part, and a further three were acquitted.
Prosecutor Sarah Wood said between them they created 167 false claims which cost the Department of Work and Pensions (DWP), which contracted A4e to carry out the work, £288,595.
Some falsified files using the names of family members, while others offered bribes in the form of vouchers to get people to fill out false forms, the court heard.
A4e ran the Aspire To Inspire lone parent mentoring programme between 2008 and 2011.
The £1.3m contract covered Berkshire, Buckinghamshire and Oxfordshire and was funded by the European Social Fund.
A4e was also paid £10,500 a month to implement it, and received payments for each person it helped gain employment.
In sentencing, Judge Angela Morris said there had been a "systematic practice" of compiling bogus files over a "considerable period of time", behaviour which she described as "appallingly cavalier".
She said: "No amount of pressure justifies the wholesale fabrication of information in files or the forgery of other people's signatures on documents, all of which is designed to extract money from the Department of Work and Pensions."
She added it was "simply wrong".
The defendants were:
A4e chief executive Andrew Dutton said the company has a "zero-tolerance policy" towards fraud and money had been set aside so "the taxpayer will have lost nothing" from the scam.
Mr Dutton said: "Their claims do not reflect the way this company operates, or the values of our 2,100 staff, whose honesty and integrity are much-valued."
