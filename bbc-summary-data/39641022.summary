Lucas Alcaraz has been outlining his vision as Algeria coach at his first public appearance since being named.

The Spaniard was appointed last Thursday just three days after being sacked by Granada.
He has signed a two-year contract with the Algeria Football Federation (FAF) and is expected to reach the last four of the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations.
"We haven't come here to impose our way of doing things. We want to integrate our ideas," he told reporters.
The 50-year-old becomes Algeria's fourth full-time coach in the last 13 months and dismissed talk about his lack of international experience.
"Before coaching in La Liga I didn't have any experience either. I have never run a national team but I'm not scared," he said.
"Every nation's football has its own qualities. We are are going to bring our ideas while we learn about Algerian football.
"I am not hard, I am not soft, I am rigorous, I give and I demand.
"I am going to analyse the needs of the team before I chose the player.
"Our duty is to see all Algerian players wherever they come from. Our choice will be made according to their form."
His appointment came as a surprise to many in Algeria since another Spaniard Joaquin Caparros had been expected to be given the job.
Alcaraz however insisted he had not been in touch with the Algerian federation while at Granada.
"I was not contacted before I was fired as Granada coach but only afterwards," he said.
"I then met with (Kherridine) Zetchi (president of FAF) and I was surprised that he knew anything about me."
He replaces Belgian Georges Leekens who quit after Algeria were eliminated from the 2017 Africa Cup of Nations at the group stage.
Christian Gourcuff resigned as coach in April 2016 to be replaced by Milovan Rajevac who quit after just two games.
Algeria are aiming to reach a third straight World Cup but are bottom of their qualifying group with a single point from two matches.
They are five points behind leaders Nigeria and their next games are home and away against Zambia, who also have one point.
Only the winners of Group B will play the 2018 World Cup in Russia.
"As for the World Cup the situation is complicated but we will fight in every match," he said.
Alcaraz's first competitive match in charge will be against visiting Togo in June when Algeria begin their qualifying campaign for the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations.
Benin and The Gambia are the other two teams in Group D, with only the pool winners guaranteed a place at the finals in Cameroon.
