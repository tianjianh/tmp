Scots judo star Stephanie Inglis has said she requires another operation as part of her recovery from serious head injuries.

The 27-year-old Commonwealth Games silver medallist was involved in a motorbike taxi accident in Vietnam in May.
Following treatment in Thailand, she was flown home to Scotland in June.
Inglis, from Daviot, near Inverness, said she believes her recovery from the injuries has gone well.
In an interview, she told BBC Radio Scotland's Kaye Adams: "I am feeling good within myself.
"I have physio twice a week which is up in Inverness and my Dad has been getting me to a gym and I go swimming."
The operation forms part of her recovery process, but doctors have said she is well enough to go on a family holiday later this year.
Taking part in judo remains her long term aim, she said.
Inglis had been in Vietnam for about four months, teaching underprivileged children, when the motorcycle accident happened.
Her skirt is believed to have become unravelled and caught in the wheel.
Friends and family set up a crowdfunding campaign to pay for her medical costs after it emerged her travel insurance was not valid because she had been in the country more than 31 days.
