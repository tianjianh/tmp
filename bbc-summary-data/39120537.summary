A Newport man has been sentenced after blowing up his own home, causing Â£220,000 worth of damage and suffering "life-threatening" burns.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
William Flindell, 50, previously pleaded guilty to arson following the incident in George Street on April 2 last year.
He was given four years and six months at Cardiff Crown Court on Tuesday.
The judge also ordered him to be transferred to hospital for mental health treatment within 28 days.
He will go back to prison once the authorities have determined he is fit to return.
Newport Crown Court had heard Flindell tampered with the gas supply in an attempt to kill himself.
He needed two months of specialist treatment in hospital after the blast, having suffered life-threatening burns to 58% of his body.
Psychiatric and probation reports said Flindell had acute and severe depressive illness.
Det Sgt Matthew Edwards of Gwent P olice said: "The explosion caused extensive damage to the premise and adjacent buildings with some residents even being re-housed whilst the investigation and repairs took place.
"The sentence today just proves the serious nature of this offence and the dangerous repercussions which can follow not only for the offender but for those living close by."
