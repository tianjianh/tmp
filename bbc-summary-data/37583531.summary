Wexham Park Hospital: £10m maternity upgrade starts

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Work is beginning on a £10m upgrade to maternity services at Wexham Park Hospital in Slough.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
It is the first in a series of building projects at the NHS trust, which include a £49m accident and emergency department and replacement of the ageing hospital at Heatherwood.
In February the hospital was commended for one of the "most impressive" turnarounds in the NHS.
It was taken over by Frimley Health NHS Foundation Trust in 2014.
The hospital trust says improvements will include en suite facilities in all labour rooms, better outpatient areas, a transitional care area for babies who need extra support from mothers, and more birthing pools.
It promises to provide full services throughout the work, with the same number of midwives and access to birthing pools.
