Andy Fleming netted the opener on 76 minutes, lashing home after Shaun Miller's shot had been blocked.
Four minutes later, Ryan Sweeney was dismissed for pulling back Tom Barkhuizen in the box and Jamie Devitt coolly despatched the spot-kick.
George Francomb made sure of a nervy finish with a fine strike from the edge of the area, but Morecambe held on.
AFC Wimbledon manager Neal Ardley told BBC Radio London:

"Of course it's disappointing. It's been a tough week for us as we've lost two players through sending-offs.
"I didn't think there was much in the game, I didn't think we were great in the first half. I think we were much better in the second.
"Moments change games. It's a moment away from 1-1, before you know it you're 2-0 down."
