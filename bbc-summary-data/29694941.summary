[SN]TITLE[SN]
New Banksy 'earring' mural appears in Bristol Harbourside

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A new mural by street artist Banksy has been painted on a wall in his home city of Bristol.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The image, a parody of Dutch painter Johannes Vermeer's Girl with a Pearl Earring, was posted on his website.
Girl with a Pierced Eardrum is painted on a building in Hanover Place in the city's Harbourside and incorporates an alarm box as the model's earring.
Banksy's last work in the city was Mobile Lovers which appeared in a doorway in Clement Street in April.
A row broke out over who owned it with Bristol City Council arguing the work was on its land.
However Banksy wrote to Broad Plain Boys' Club saying it was theirs and the club sold it to a private collector for Â£403,000.
