The Serb, who won five Premier League titles and the Champions League in his eight-year spell at Old Trafford, says injuries have forced his retirement.
Vidic, 34, left Inter Milan by mutual consent in January after failing to make an appearance for the Serie A side this season.
"The time has come for me to hang up my boots," he told  ManUtd.com
"The injuries I have had in the last few years have taken their toll.
"I would like to thank all the players I have played with, all the managers and staff I have worked with, and say a big thank you to the fans for their support over the years."
Vidic joined Inter Milan on a free transfer in July 2014 and made 28 appearances for the Nerazzurri in his first campaign, but did not feature for Roberto Mancini's side this season following surgery on a hernia in August.
He joined Manchester United from Spartak Moscow in a Â£7m transfer in January 2006, and quickly formed a centre-back pairing with Rio Ferdinand. Sir Alex Ferguson's side secured a hat-trick of Premier League titles between 2007 and 2009, as well as the 2008 Champions League.
Vidic won two further Premier League titles, in 2010-11 and 2012-13, and three League Cups, but his latter years at Old Trafford were badly affected by injuries, including ruptured cruciate knee ligaments  against Basel in December 2011.
