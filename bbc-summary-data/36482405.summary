Det Ch Insp Amanda Davies, from Staffordshire Police, said: "This incident could have easily resulted in a child dying had a vigilant member of the public not alerted emergency services.
"The boy was clearly distressed and the conditions in the car would have been stifling."
The Stoke-on-Trent couple remain in custody.
