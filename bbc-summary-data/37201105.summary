A pioneer of the women's game, Gore was involved in football for over 60 years and had been suffering from cancer.
Known as the 'Denis Law of women's football', she once scored 134 goals in a season.
In 1972, Gore scored England women's first goal during a 3-2 victory against Scotland in Greenock.
After her playing days Gore was Wales manager, an FA Women's Committee member for 20 years and named Manchester City Women's FC Club Ambassador in  March 2016.

Women's football's forgotten heroes
Born on Merseyside, Gore played through the Football Association's 50-year ban on the women's game and continued to be involved when the FA took over the Women's Football Association in 1993.
"We were losing 2-0 at the time and to run halfway down the pitch to score the first goal was tremendous," Gore said of her opening goal in the 3-2 win over Scotland in 1972.
"I was delighted, I was jumping in the air and everyone was diving on me."
Gore was raised in the north west of England and started playing for Manchester Corinthians in the late 1950s, travelling to South America with them at the age of 13.
She was Wales team manager from 1982 to 1989, sat on the FA Women's Committee for 20 years and was a delegate for the Women's Super League.
She was inducted into the National Football Museum Hall of Fame in 2014.
