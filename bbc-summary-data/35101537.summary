Ten members of a gang who conspired to supply £5m worth of heroin have been jailed.

Led by "generals" Mohammed Sajjad, 38, from Cardiff, and Imtiaz Ali, 35, from Newport, the group were involved in bringing the class A drug into Wales.
Cardiff Crown Court heard the group was arrested as part of one of the largest undercover operations in Wales.
Four were convicted after trial, while six others pleaded guilty to their part in the conspiracy from 2013-2014.
Arrests were made after police seized 40kg (88lbs) of the drug in 2014.
Most was found inside a speaker and a suitcase in a car stopped on the M5, while a smaller amount was discovered in the footwell of a taxi in Newport.
Officers said the seizure had prevented half a million drug deals, the court heard.
Sentencing the group, Judge Stephen Hopkins QC, said the gang had dealt in "industrial quantities" of the "highly addictive evil drug".
There have been more heroin seizures across the South Wales Police force area than anywhere else in Wales and England, outside London, for at least the past three years, according to figures from the Home Office.
During 2014-2015, South Wales Police made 303 heroin seizures per million people. The average for Wales and England was 135 seizures per million.
A force spokesman said: "There is a greater focus from the Regional Organised Crime Unit (ROCU) utilising the control strategy - which enables us to prioritise a coordinated approach on regional crime groups and the traffic of drugs."
