Emergency crews were expecting to deal with an increased number of alcohol-fuelled incidents as people marked the start of the festive period.
The last Friday before Christmas is known as "Mad" or "Black Friday".
Gwent Police and South Wales Police said the number of arrests were on par with any busy Friday or Saturday night.
Gwent made 28 arrests, while 134 were held by South Wales Police which said its average was 129.
Dyfed-Powys and North Wales forces have not revealed their arrest numbers but all four police forces said the evening passed without any real issues.
Inspector Jason Herbert, of South Wales Police, said: "Demand was in line with the season.
"There were no serious incidents of note and it passed without any real concerns.
"It was busier than a normal Friday, but not as busy as previous Fridays at this time of year.
"I'd like to thank the public for taking onboard the advice from all the emergency services and for playing their part in making it a safe evening."
