Grim discoveries: What creatures are found in food?

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A food company is investigating after a dead lizard was found in one of its cans of tomatoes in Birmingham. But it is not the first time living creatures have been found in food.

Despite rigorous checks and increased scrutiny about the origins of our food, there have been a number of instances of creatures managing to sneak under the radar and end up in the home.
In one incident revealed this week, Sanam Hussain was cooking a curry in Alum Rock, Birmingham, when she discovered a lizard in a can of tomatoes.
Supplier Euro Foods said it would have the can analysed and put controls in place to stop it happening again.
Here are some of the other examples that have made headlines.
Christina Carrington said she was "disgusted and angry" after a live frog was found in a bag of salad bought from Waitrose in Ringwood, Hampshire in 2012.
The frog went unnoticed for a night while the bag was in Mrs Carrington's fridge and was only discovered by her daughter the following day.
Waitrose apologised to Mrs Carrington, from Chandler's Ford.
It said it was an isolated incident and was taking steps to make sure it did not happen again.
A father in Oxfordshire found a dead mouse in a loaf of bread as he made sandwiches for his children.
Stephen Forse, of Kidlington, had already used some slices when he came across the mouse.
He bought it online, through Tesco's Bicester branch, in January 2009.
Premier Foods was fined £5,500 and ordered to pay £11,109.47 in costs at Oxford Crown Court.
There was a nasty surprise in a baby leaf and rocket salad bought at Tesco's Burnham-on-Sea branch in 2011: a dead bird.
Paul Streeter, from Weare, Somerset, said he was seconds from eating the carcass when the grim discovery was made.
Tesco apologised, saying it took the matter extremely seriously.
A wildlife sanctuary was called to rescue a nest of black widow spiders found inside a bunch of grapes at a Warwickshire supermarket.
The grapes were purchased from Asda in Leamington Spa on Tuesday.
Geoff Grewcock, from the Nuneaton and Warwickshire Wildlife Sanctuary, said the fruit had come from Mexico and the spiders were "very" venomous.
Asda said it was in contact with the customer and that such incidents were "extremely rare".
Fast food restaurant KFC tried to compensate Thomas Haighton with a voucher for a six-piece variety bucket after he found a caterpillar in his burger.
He bought the meal from the outlet in Carrickfergus, County Antrim, and his wife discovered the insect when he arrived home.
KFC said it was a "one-off incident" and stressed its Carrickfergus branch had scored highly in a recent hygiene inspection.
Cate Barrett was shocked to discover a dead mouse while investigating why her jar of Extra Special Tikka Masala sauce was "a bit lumpy".
Ms Barrett, from St Austell, Cornwall, bought the jar from Asda in 2009 and said the finding did put her off her dinner.
Asda said it was an isolated incident and took the product off sale while it investigated how the mishap occurred.
