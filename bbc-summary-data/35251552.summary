Mr Simpson-Kent, 48, is being sought by police after three bodies were found at the couple's home in south-east London.
The BBC understands he has left the UK after being interviewed by the police and may be in Ghana.
Ava Blake made the comments as she called for him to return to "face justice".
Sian Blake and the couple's sons, aged eight and four, have not been seen since 13 December. They were reported missing three days later.
Police said the possibility Mr Simpson-Kent may have left the UK was "one line of inquiry" and he was being sought urgently.
They have been in touch with Ghanaian police as part of their search, although it is not known if Mr Simpson-Kent is in the west African country.
Sian Blake, 43, who has motor neurone disease, played Frankie Pierre in EastEnders between 1996 and 1997.
Speaking at New Scotland Yard,  Ava Blake, said: "I want him to face justice.
"It's my nephews more than anything. My brother is angry. My cousins are angry.
"They are angry about Sian, but the boys have devastated us. We have lost a generation. We can never replace them."
She said her sister had been "a lot more quiet" over the past year and had asked to move back home.
"In our opinion the relationship had already come to an end but she hadn't quite made that break or that decision to leave Arthur," she said.
"She didn't want to throw him out on the street but give him time to find somewhere else to live. That was the only point she was wavering on."
She said her sister had told their mother, Pansy, that she wanted to end the relationship "a long time ago".
Referring to Mr Simpson-Kent, Miss Blake said: "I don't know what is going through his mind."
The Met has referred the case to the Independent Police Complaints Commission over how the investigation was handled.
The bodies, found at the family home in Erith on Tuesday, have not yet been formally identified.
