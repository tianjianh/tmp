Van Gerwen came out on top 11-10 in an exciting final to follow up his Grand Slam of Darts success in Wolverhampton seven days earlier with another tournament victory.
"I played well when I had to," said the 26-year-old Dutchman.
"I think I deserved to win the trophy and I'm really glad I did."
Van Gerwen went 4-0 ahead in the best-of-21-legs final, but Suffolk-based Wright, 45, won the next five legs to take the lead - a run that was halted by a 170 checkout from Van Gerwen.
At 9-9, two missed darts at double 14 looked to have proved costly for Van Gerwen as Wright moved to within one leg of his first major televised title.
But Van Gerwen, the PDC world champion in 2014, produced a stunning 129 checkout to take the match into a deciding leg and he clinched victory with an 11-darter.
"Peter is a fantastic player and sooner or later he will win a big tournament," he added.
