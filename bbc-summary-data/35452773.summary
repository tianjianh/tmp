Police in San Francisco have caught two inmates who had been on the run from jail for more than a week.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Jonathan Tieu, 20, and Hossein Nayeri, 37, had fled from the Men's Central Jail in Santa Ana on 22 January.
The men cut through several layers of metal to break free from their dormitory and used a rope made of bed sheets to climb down from the roof.
Another escapee, Bac Duong, 43, surrendered to police in Santa Ana on Friday.
Reports said he told officers the two other men had travelled north. They were eventually found some some 410 miles (660km) further north from Santa Ana.
Police said a passer-by recognised the van which had been stolen after they escaped.
Nayeri was held after a brief chase, and when police returned to the van, they found Tieu inside. Ammunition was found, but no weapons.
Before his escape, Duong was being held on charges including attempted murder and assault with a deadly weapon.
Tieu had been charged with murder and attempted murder while Nayeri is accused of kidnapping, torture, aggravated mayhem and burglary.
On Thursday, authorities arrested a female English teacher who they say helped the inmates escape.
