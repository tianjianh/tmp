Jakub Gorski, 19, was found with a stab wound to the chest in Hope Street, Higher Broughton, at about 19:45 BST on Friday evening.
He was taken to hospital where he later died.
On Sunday Greater Manchester Police arrested a fourth man on suspicion of murder.
Three other men, aged 26, 26 and 49, who were also questioned over the killing have been bailed.
Det Ch Insp Terry Crompton appealed for anyone with information to come forward.
He said: "Jakub's death has left a gaping hole in his family, who are understandably devastated by the loss of their young son and brother.
"To lose a child in such violent circumstances must be incredibly difficult to come to terms with, and my officers and I offer our most sincere condolences to the Gorski family at this time.
"We are doing everything we can to ensure we bring those responsible for his untimely death to justice, and the public can assist us in this task."
