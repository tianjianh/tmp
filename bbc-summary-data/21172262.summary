The package allows the broadcaster to show extended highlights of 226 league games per season.
It already has the rights to show 116 live games from next season.
In a separate deal, News International has won the rights to show highlights of 380 Premier League games on the internet and on mobile devices.
The package allows the publishing group, which owns The Times and The Sun newspapers in the UK, to show in-game clips for all the matches, apart from those that kick off at 3pm on Saturdays, and extended clips of all weekend matches on the following Monday.
"We are extremely pleased with this exciting development that sees News International, traditionally a newspaper publishing organisation, move further into the digital media space through the acquisition of our UK near-live clip rights," said the Premier League's chief executive Richard Scudamore.
The deal also runs for three seasons starting 2013-14.
