Unite backs Jeremy Corbyn for Labour leader

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Britain's biggest trade union Unite is backing veteran left-winger Jeremy Corbyn as Labour leader.

The union's executive committee voted to lend its support to Mr Corbyn, with Andy Burnham as its second preference.
The union, which is Labour's biggest financial backer, supported Ed Miliband in the 2010 Labour leadership contest.
The unions will have less influence on this year's contest because the party has moved to a "one member one vote" system for choosing its leader.
But the decision is a big boost for Mr Corbyn, who has been well received at hustings involving trade unions in recent weeks.
Mr Corbyn has been taking part in a leadership hustings in Wales with his three rivals for the job - Andy Burnham, Yvette Cooper and Liz Kendall, all prominent shadow ministers.
Who are the Labour leadership candidates?
The Islington North MP said: "It is a great honour to receive Unite's nomination, and it underlines that this a serious campaign that has growing momentum.
"The leadership election is about one issue above others: whether we accept another five years of a race to the bottom based on cuts that destroy services and damage living standards, or whether we invest our way to a growth and fairness."
He also thanked other trade unions who have nominated him - Aslef and the BFAWU - and for the endorsement of two unions not affiliated to Labour, the FBU and the RMT.
He added: "Trade unions are a force for good, a force for prosperity and we should listen to them more. For Labour to win again it must show it is on the side of the majority."
Unite said its backing for Mr Corbyn was in recognition that his policies were most closely aligned with those of the union.
Backbench MP Mr Corbyn only made it on to the ballot for the leadership contest thanks to a last minute rush of support from Labour MPs who said they wanted to widen the debate about the party's future, but would not be voting for him as leader.
He told BBC Radio 5's Pienaar's Politics he was "very grateful" to those MPs who had backed him.
And he hit back at the "Tories for Corbyn" campaign, which has reportedly seen supporters of the government signing up as registered Labour supporters for Â£3, to vote for him because they believe his election would boost the Conservative cause.
"If people do not support the Labour Party and do not wish to vote Labour, either in future elections or have done so in the past, they should not be registering as Labour supporters, it's not an honest thing to do," said the MP.
Unite said it would not be nominating anyone for deputy Labour leader but would be making a recommendation to members to support Tom Watson and Angela Eagle.
The decisions on who to support were taken on Sunday following debate by the union's executive committee, an elected body of 63 men and women from workplaces across the UK.
