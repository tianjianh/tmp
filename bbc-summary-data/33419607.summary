[SN]TITLE[SN]
English tour guide guilty of anti-Welsh racism

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An English tour guide who takes visitors around Wales has been found guilty of anti-Welsh racism.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Irene Laird, 64, who now lives in Caernarfon, was convicted after a trial before a district judge in the town.
She was fined and given a 60-day suspended jail sentence for offences including racially-aggravated common assault on Gwladys Jones last December.
The incidents, in the Caernarfon area, were unrelated to Laird's business. She told the court: "I am not a racist".
Laird was also found guilty of common assault on Mrs Jones and racially-aggravated threatening behaviour on a second occasion in February.
District Judge Gwyn Jones said Laird was wrong in thinking Mrs Jones was someone she had encountered previously.
He said Laird met the complainant in a public park and used strong racist and offensive language that amounted to "gratuitous degradation" of the victim.
The defendant was ordered to pay a Â£500 fine and Â£1,000 compensation, while a five-year restraining order was imposed.
