Alex Jones: Don't judge older mums as 'selfish'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
One Show presenter Alex Jones, who recently announced her pregnancy, has urged people to stop judging older mums ahead of fronting a fertility show.

Jones told the Radio Times it was wrong that women who had children later were labelled "selfish career women".
She added it was "frustrating" that blame for fertility issues often focuses on the female partner even though male fertility drops after 40.
Fertility and Me will air on BBC One on 20 September.
The programme, filmed before she was pregnant, sees the 39-year-old undergoing tests to check her fertility.
She also looks into new techniques aiming to boost the chances of conception.
Jones said she found "hard facts about fertility and conception hard to come by".
She added: "I came to realise that the best way to describe conception is 'Russian roulette'. Women often blame themselves for miscarriage, but in a very high number of cases it's actually the male sperm that causes the miscarriage.
"It takes two people to have a baby. I feel strongly that it's very much a case of 'they' and 'we' as opposed to 'she' or 'I'."
