Katie Leong, 52, was convicted of attempted murder in March after blinding Daniel Rotariu, 31, at their home in Leicester on 26 July 2016.
Leong, who was described as being "fixated" with acid attacks, is serving a minimum of 17 years in prison.
Mr Rotariu suffered burns and nearly died following the six-second attack.

During the trial, Mr Rotariu said he was woken in the middle of the night by a "burning" feeling.
The court heard Leong had poured sulphuric acid at 96% concentration over him, causing burns to a third of his body.
On Wednesday, Leicester Crown Court was told Leong has £13,000 in assets, as well as £1,500 in a Post Office savings account and £4,800 lodged with her sister, amounting in total to £19,300.
Leong appeared before Judge Nicholas Dean QC and asked for some of her funds to be left for her eventual release.
The 52-year-old, who represented herself, told the court: "I want to state that obviously I am in prison for a while and when I come out I don't want to be dependent on my family.
"I need a little bit myself for when I come out."
Judge Dean replied: "That is not really how it works. You are not giving anything, I am making an order that you pay compensation.
"My concern is to try and provide some measure, and it can only go a very modest way in truth, of compensation because of the horrific injuries."
The Independent Police Complaints Commission is currently investigating Leicestershire Police's handling of information received about Leong prior to the assault.
