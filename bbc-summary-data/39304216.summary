Key witness appeal after Glasgow city centre rape

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Police are trying to trace a key witness who went to aid of a woman shortly after she was raped in Glasgow city centre early on Friday.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 36-year-old woman was assaulted in a lane off Renfrew Street, near Charing Cross, between 04:00 and 04:30.
Police Scotland said there was no description of the attacker but officers were collecting CCTV footage.
Officers want to speak to a man who offered the victim water before police arrived, who may hold key information.
Forensic experts have been examining the scene of the attack for evidence that could identify the assailant.
Det Insp Graeme McLachlan said: "We are trying to establish the exact circumstances of what happened and piece together the information we currently have.
"I am appealing to anyone who was in the area who may have heard anything or who may have seen something.
"I am particularly keen to identify a man described as being in his 30s, with short brown hair, who went to the assistance of the woman providing her with water before police arrival. If this is you, or you know who it is, please make contact with police as soon as possible.
"I know the incident occurred in the early hours of this morning but there may have been passing motorists or people out and about in the area who may have seen something which seemed a little odd or suspicious to them.
"I would appeal to these people to please contact us and pass on any small piece of information.  You may think it's not important but it could turn out to be that vital piece of information which leads us to the suspect."
