[SN]TITLE[SN]
Bournemouth v Middlesbrough

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Bournemouth will assess the fitness of midfielder Dan Gosling, who has missed three games with a calf problem.

Jack Wilshere is out for the season with a fractured leg, so there could be a recall for Lewis Cook.
Middlesbrough defender Calum Chambers might be involved after a nine-week absence because of a foot injury.
Fabio and Rudy Gestede are fit after minor injuries but Victor Valdes and Grant Leadbitter remain out with respective rib and hamstring problems.
Simon Brotherton: "Middlesbrough are still saying the right things about staying up, but it looks bleak for them now and there's no hint of a remarkable recovery in the air.
"They haven't won in the league since just before Christmas and are without a victory from any of their last 15 away games.
"While the Teesiders sit six points short of safety, Bournemouth are perched seven points above it and should be fine.
"Recent results haven't been great though and Boro's often chance-starved forwards will have noted that Bournemouth have conceded at least two goals in seven of the last eight games on the south coast."

Bournemouth manager Eddie Howe: "I'm not going to say that one win will make us safe but we're very motivated to win this game.
"We were on a really good run before playing the top two. We knew how hard this run was going to be but we've come out mainly unscathed after it.
"It's about us from our perspective, how well we attack the game and how our minds are focused on doing what we want to do. We know our jobs and know how important the game is."
Middlesbrough head coach Steve Agnew: "Of course it is a big week and of course it's a massive game. But you have to enjoy it and that's the only way I know, that's what the players and staff know.
"They are all relishing the game on Saturday. You do need wins and that's what we have missed, and that's what we need from now on in.
"Yes, you need to be hard to beat and continue to be difficult to beat, but equally you need a goal to take the three points we need."
While Boro have the staunch smell of relegation about them, Bournemouth probably only need one more win to be safe, and I think they will get it on Saturday.
