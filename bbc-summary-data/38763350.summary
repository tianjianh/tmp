Prince Harry has been turning heads in his running gear - as he went for a jog with a group of young homeless people.

He donned tights, shorts and trainers to pound the pavements in Willesden Green, north London, for a 17-minute run.
The royal drew double-takes from motorists as he stepped out with young people and volunteers from the Running Charity.
The charity helps young people develop life skills through sport.
Programme officer Claude Umuhire, 26, took the runners, including a Met Police protection officer, through a strenuous warm-up session then led the more gentle run.
He said about Harry: "He didn't find any of it hard, I think he's been training just for today.
"He found everything easy,
"I tried to get him in the warm-up but he did pretty well, he kept giving me looks though every time I said five squats."
Despite apparently coping well with the run, the Prince suggested he might prefer a lighter form of exercise on future visits.
When he left, he referred to a pool table in the charity's HQ and joked: "Next time I will come and play pool maybe".
He added: "There was a woman who was pulling out of her driveway then she realised who he was and she drove in front of us and started taking pictures of him.
"And as we were leaving, there was a guy at the traffic lights who looked across and did a double take - the joy in his face it was so funny, his eyes just opened up, he was so happy."
The charity is working with some of the residents from a hostel founded by the Depaul charity.
