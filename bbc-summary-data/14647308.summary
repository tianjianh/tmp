Lebanon country profile

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
With its high literacy rate and traditional mercantile culture, Lebanon has traditionally been an important commercial hub for the Middle East.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
It has also often been at the centre of Middle Eastern conflicts, despite its small size, because of its borders with Syria and Israel and its uniquely complex communal make-up.
Shia Muslims, Sunni Muslims, Christians and Druze are the main population groups in a country that has been a refuge for the region's minorities for centuries.
Population 4.3 million
Area 10,452 sq km (4,036 sq miles)
Major language Arabic
Major religions Islam, Christianity
Life expectancy 71 years (men), 75 years (women)
President: Michel Aoun
Michel Aoun was elected by parliament in October 2016, ending a political stalemate which had left the country without a head of state since May 2014.
He is the founder of the mainly Maronite Christian political party, the Free Patriotic Movement (FPM). He was army commander-in-chief from 1984 until 1989 and was appointed prime minister of the interim military government in 1988.
He launched an unsuccessful "liberation war" against the presence of Syrian forces in 1989 and fled to France in 1990. When Syrian troops left in 2005, he returned to form an alliance with pro-Syrian parties.
Prime minister: Saad Hariri
Saad Hariri - a Sunni Muslim leader and businessman - was nominated to form a government by President Aoun in November 2016.
He previously held the post between 2009 and 2011, after which he lived outside the country citing safety concerns.
Following the assassination of his father and former Prime Minister Rafik Hariri in 2005, he entered politics and founded the Future Current political party.
He was born in Saudi Arabia in 1970 and has spent much of his adult life there. His construction company, Saudi Oger, is based in Saudi Arabia and Mr Hariri is considered one of Lebanon's richest individuals.
Lebanon's broadcasting scene is developed, lively and diverse, and reflects the country's pluralism and divisions.
It was the first Arab country to permit private radio and TV. These outlets dominate the broadcasting scene and air some of the most outspoken TV talk shows in the region.
News websites have emerged as a key information source.
