Swedish police have told the BBC there were two sets of safety barriers in place on the bridge, red warning lights were flashing, and other drivers were waiting.
The band's car fell through a gap which had opened to let a boat pass through, police said.
Officers are examining the car to try to find the cause of the crash, which happened at about 02:30 local time (01:30 GMT) near Stockholm.
The Warrington band were in Sweden to take part in a music festival on Friday and were due to play a gig in Guildford in Surrey on Saturday.
