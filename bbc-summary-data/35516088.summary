Millions of people across Brazil have joined in on the first day of festivities.
The Zika virus is a disease which is spread by a type of mosquito. It has spread very quickly across South and Central America.
Zika is very unlikely to affect the UK because the mosquitoes that carry the disease live in tropical countries and would find the UK too cold.
Most people who catch Zika aren't affected very badly but it is much more serious for women who are pregnant.
Scientists say they think it may affect how a baby grows before it's born.
The BBC's Julia Carneiro sent this report from Rio de Janeiro.
