The victim sustained a serious head injury when he was attacked in a car park off Castle Street early on Sunday.
It happened at about 01:30 BST near the rear of a hotel. He is in a critical condition in Belfast's Royal Victoria Hospital.
The arrested man, who is 22, has been detained on suspicion of causing grievous bodily harm.
Det Sgt Chris Wilkinson said there was "a large number of people in the area at the time" and he appealed for witnesses to assist the investigation.
North Antrim MLA Mervyn Storey said people in the town had been "shocked" by the attack.
"Our thoughts and prayers are with the young man and his family at time," the DUP member added.
"This was not the way the evening in Ballymoney should have ended, it is a tragedy for all involved."
