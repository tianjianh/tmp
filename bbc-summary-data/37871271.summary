'Surge' of Saturday shoppers from Republic

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
There has been a surge in Saturday morning shoppers travelling to Northern Ireland from the Republic since the EU referendum, road traffic data suggests.

Sterling has fallen sharply against the euro, meaning southern shoppers can get much better value in northern shops.
It shows that since the vote, south-to-north traffic flows from 10:00-11:00 on Saturday are up from 3% year-on-year before the vote to 29% year-on-year.
The border-crossing data was gathered by Ireland's National Roads Authority.
The largest increase in the opposite direction is 18:00-19:00 on a Sunday, which analysis from Goodbody Stockbrokers suggested possibly reflected a return from a weekend spent in Northern Ireland.
While the overall impact on consumer spending in the Republic would be relatively modest, "the economic impact on border counties could be significant", said Goodbody Chief Economist Dermot O'Leary.
