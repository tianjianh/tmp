Cyril Banks, 91, of Bishop's Stortford, Hertfordshire, had £9,000 stolen from him by fraudsters in June.
Thousands of pounds were raised for him within hours on a GoFundMe page.
Mr Banks has donated all the leftover money, including £2,000 to a footballer  who lost his legs in a car crash.
On Friday night, Mr Banks presented cheques to other charities at a concert he organises annually at Ugley village hall in Essex.
"Cyril does the concert every year, but this one's extra special as it shows what a generous, lovely, giving person he is," said his friend Annie Riley.
He gave money to the Not Forgotten association, which helps serving and ex-service men and women, the Royal British Legion's poppy appeal, the Salvation Army and Think Jessica, which works to warn elderly and vulnerable people about scams.
Mr Banks also gave £2,000 to footballer Shaun Whiter, 27, who was seriously injured in a hit-and-run in Newmarket on 1 July.
"He's done the right thing by giving the leftover money away - it would have been wrong of him to have kept more, but it was so kind of people to give it to him," Ms Riley said.
"It's given him a new lease of life to talk about what happened to him and to warn others about scams," she added.
"If we hadn't done it, it could have gone horribly wrong and finished him off - he was so upset when it first happened to him."
Hertfordshire Police said the investigation into the theft from Mr Banks was ongoing.
