[SN]TITLE[SN]
Canterbury Cathedral may 'close for business' after losing lottery bid

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Canterbury Cathedral has said it may have to close to visitors after it missed out on Â£10m of lottery funding.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Two thirds of the building is in urgent need of repair including the Christchurch Gate, which is the main entrance for tourists.
Andrew Edwards, from the Canterbury Cathedral Trust, said if a piece of stone fell from the gate the cathedral would be "closed for business".
The cathedral plans to resubmit its bid in 2014.
Mr Edwards said the money would go towards a five-year conservation project.
He said: "The funding is absolutely critical - 68% of the entire project cost was going on major restoration work that was identified by our architects as being urgent and essential.
"We're in a position here where Christchurch Gate, if a piece of stone falls we're closed for business."
The cathedral is looking to international sources to raise money.
