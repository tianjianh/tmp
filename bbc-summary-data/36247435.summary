[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Star Randel-Hanson killed Derick Marney, 70, at a flat in Vernon Terrace, Brighton, in May 2015.
His body was discovered after suspicious comments Randel-Hanson, 50, made to a tarot card reader on Brighton seafront were reported to police.
He was found guilty of murder after a trial at Croydon Crown Court.
Sussex Police said it was "not clear" what motivated Randel-Hanson to kill his flatmate.
Mr Marney died from a six-inch (15cm) stab wound to his side, which punctured his vital organs.
Det Ch Insp Paul Rymarz said: "He had been living at Marney's flat for several months, apparently on good terms, having first met at a local Spiritualist church.
"However, their relationship seems to have had some problems, culminating a dispute of some kind on the day Marney was killed.
"Randel-Hansen was in the kitchen when Marney came in, and he maintained in court that the fatal injury took place when the victim came in unexpectedly."
The judge sentenced him to a minimum term of 14 years in prison.
