Fleeing police, Mark MacCormick drove at more than 80mph (130 km/h) on 24 November before his vehicle hit a lamp-post and telegraph pole in Stockport.
The 30-year-old, who had traces of drugs in his system, ran away, abandoning Declan Blackburne, 21, who was fatally injured in the car.
MacCormick, of Norton Grove, Stockport, admitted causing death by dangerous driving and was jailed for six years.
He was also disqualified from driving for eight years when he was sentenced at Manchester's Minshull Street Crown Court.
Greater Manchester Police (GMP) said an officer in an unmarked car spotted MacCormick speeding in Cheadle Heath, Stockport and began to follow him.
After a short period, the officer activated his vehicle's blue lights and instructed MacCormick to pull over.
MacCormick took a turning into a public car park and briefly circled around it before suddenly accelerating out of it.
He then reached speeds in excess of 80mph before losing control of his car, flipping off the carriageway and hitting a lamp-post, telephone junction box and a wooden telegraph pole at such speed that all were broken in half.
As the car came to a stop, he jumped out and ran away.
His passenger Mr Blackburne was taken to hospital where he died 12 days later.
MacCormick presented himself at Cheadle Health Police Station where he was arrested.
At the time of the arrest he had traces of cannabis and cocaine in his system, police said.
