It plans to open a cafe and bake shop in Argyle Street in early May before rolling out nationwide over the next 12 months.
Tim Hortons offers hot and cold beverages as well as baked goods, breakfast and lunch items.
It is part of Restaurant Brands International, which operates more than 23,000 restaurants around the world.
According to the company, eight out of 10 cups of coffee sold across Canada are served at Tim Hortons outlets.
Gurprit Dhaliwal, chief operating officer of Tim Hortons UK and Ireland, said: "We've witnessed Tim Hortons' phenomenal success in Canada, and wanted to replicate this in Great Britain.
"It's hard to explain just how important Tim Hortons is to Canadians - it's not just a restaurant, it's a way of life and a place of 'home', and we're positive Great Britain will fall in love with the brand."
