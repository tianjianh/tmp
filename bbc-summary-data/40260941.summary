Nottinghamshire set up a One-Day Cup semi-final at Essex on Friday after beating Somerset by 24 runs in a high-scoring thriller at Taunton.

Batting first, Notts made 429-9, their second-highest List A score, anchored by Brendan Taylor's 154 off 97 balls.
Somerset were well placed after a stand of 154 in 16 overs between Dean Elgar (91) and Peter Trego (66).
The hosts' lower order kept attacking but continued to lose wickets and they were all out for 405 in 48 overs.
Jamie Overton (40) looked to be taking the match to the final few balls with some magnificent six hitting, but was run out when attempting to keep the strike to give Notts victory.
When South Africa opener Elgar and Trego were in full swing, the mammoth target looked achievable - the duo smashing Somerset to 221-3 in the 24th over.
But the dismissal of Trego, caught on the mid-wicket boundary off spinner Samit Patel, was quickly followed by Stuart Broad bowling Elgar, checking the hosts' momentum.
Somerset's lower order still managed to find regular boundaries as the required run-rate hovered around 10 an over, although Overton's cameo alongside Roelof van der Merwe (43) and Lewis Gregory (26) was ultimately in vein.
Earlier Nottinghamshire's batsman had struck Somerset's bowlers to all parts on a flat Taunton track with Riki Wessels (81) and Patel (66) providing fine support for Taylor.
The Zimbabwean raced to his hundred in just 69 balls, and appeared to be taking Notts beyond the List A best of 445-8 they made against Northants at Trent Bridge in 2016.
He was eventually dismissed by Lewis Gregory (4-60) in the 48th over, but had already done enough to ensure the huge total which put his side in the last four.
