Hull City: Championship club to scrap season tickets for membership scheme

Hull City plan to replace season tickets with a membership scheme.

The Championship club claim the new system could see some supporters save as much as £282.
Hull will give fans the choice of three different levels of membership, with the cheapest costing £21 a month.
Vice chairman Ehab Allam said: "For too long, the price of football in this country has been much too high. This new scheme will at least ensure the same cannot be said of Hull."
The BBC's Price of Football survey 2015 found that the Tigers' cheapest season ticket cost £531, while their most expensive was £606.
Their cheapest ticket is currently the costliest in the second tier of English football, but eight clubs have more expensive tickets in the top band of pricing.
Allam added: "The membership scheme is about rewarding the supporters for their fundamental part in this remarkable story and ensuring that, wherever the team start their new campaign, the club and the fans will be doing it together."
If the Tigers, currently fourth in the second tier, reach the Premier League this season then some supporters will pay £13 per match next season, while remaining in the Football League will lower that figure to £11 per game.
It is understood this is the first time such a scheme has been tried by a Football League club, although Barnet, then in the Conference, scrapped season tickets in favour of a monthly non-contract membership scheme in 2013.
