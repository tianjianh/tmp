Voters head to polls across UK for 'Super Thursday' elections

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Voters are casting their votes in elections across the UK, with less than an hour to go before polls close.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Elections are taking place for the Scottish Parliament, National Assembly of Wales, the Northern Ireland Assembly and for 124 councils in England.
Mayors will be elected in London, Bristol, Liverpool and Salford, with UK parliamentary by-elections held in Ogmore and Sheffield Brightside.
Police and crime commissioners are also being elected in England and Wales.
Problems were reported in Barnet, North London, where the council apologised after some people were unable to vote on Thursday morning.
The Electoral Commission said some polling stations did not have the correct lists of people's names.
Later in the morning, the council said the correct registers had been delivered and those denied a vote should come back.
Polling stations across the length and breadth of the country opened at 07:00 BST, with voting allowed until 22:00 BST.
Thursday's polls are the single largest test of political opinion before the next general election, which is scheduled for 2020.
Elections to the Holyrood Parliament in Edinburgh and the devolved assemblies in Cardiff and Belfast last took place in 2011.
The SNP has been in power in Scotland since 2007, while Labour has run the Welsh government since 1999.
There is a power-sharing arrangement in place in the Northern Ireland Executive. The DUP and Sinn Fein have been the two largest parties at Stormont since 2011.

In total, 2,747 seats in English councils - spanning metropolitan boroughs, unitary authorities and district councils - are up for grabs. The majority of the seats were last contested in 2012.
In London, the Greater London Assembly will be elected, as will a successor to the capital's mayor Boris Johnson, who has run City Hall since 2008. Mayoral contests will also be held in Bristol, Liverpool and Salford.
Election coverage on the BBC:
New MPs for the constituencies of Ogmore, in Bridgend County, and Sheffield Brightside and Hillsborough will also be chosen.
The Ogmore by-election was triggered by former Labour MP Huw Irranca-Davies's decision to stand for the Welsh Assembly. The Sheffield contest was caused by the death of sitting Labour MP Harry Harpham.
Voters in 40 police force areas in England and Wales, excluding London and Greater Manchester, will also elect a police and crime commissioner. The inaugural elections for the positions were held in 2012.
Counting will take place throughout Friday with the majority of results declared on the day.
However, some English council results will not be announced until Saturday, when the final result of the Northern Irish election is also expected.
