Having resumed on 106-1, the visitors added 96 runs before Jimmy Adams was caught behind off Jake Ball for 99.
Tom Alsop's 93, and half-centuries from Liam Dawson and Ryan McLaren, helped Hampshire reach 393-7 before declaring.
Jake Libby was caught off the bowling of Andy Carter, before Mason Crane removed Riki Wessels as Notts closed on 42-2, still needing 425 to win.
Hampshire would leapfrog their opponents to eighth in Division One should they take the final eight wickets on Tuesday, with Notts currently only four points above them in the table.
The visitors dominated the morning session thanks to Adams and Alsop's 160-run stand, but Adams fell one run short of his first century of the season.
Alsop also lost his wicket when close to reaching a maiden first-class ton, but McLaren's 81 from 71 deliveries kept their side firmly in command.
Carter removed Libby with his first ball of the innings, having already taken 4-52, while Wessels' dismissal with final ball of the third session left Notts with a daunting challenge to deny Hampshire victory on the final day.
