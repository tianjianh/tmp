The 2016 Olympic gold medallist, 29, went into the final day with a 13-point lead despite being in a scratch pairing with crew Eilidh McIntyre in Santander.
"Although we had a good points gap going into this medal race I think that often adds pressure, as everyone expects you to win," said Mills.
"To come away and pull it off, it's a relief."
Mills only returned to competition in May because of a concussion and stomach problems she had suffered since her triumph at the Rio Games.
But the victory in Spain was a chance for Mills to regain her racing edge, returning to the 470 class after trying her hand in the 49er FX.
"The conditions were so tricky that it just felt the safest option was to take it to the Dutch girls [second-placed Afrodite Zegers and Anneloes Van Veen] and try and practice a bit of a match race," said the Cardiff native.
"We don't often get this opportunity where you're far enough ahead that you're guaranteed a silver, so we thought let's just see what we can do and pulled it off quite nicely."
