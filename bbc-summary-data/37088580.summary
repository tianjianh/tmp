Cardiff City boss Paul Trollope says he was frustrated with the Bluebirds' lack of creativity in their 2-0 defeat at home to Queens Park Rangers on Sunday.

Cardiff managed only one shot on target and have failed to find the net in their first three games this term.
Trollope said his side would learn "good lessons" following their first Championship defeat of the season.
"We didn't fire in and around their box and didn't create the chances our play deserved," Trollope said.
"It's something we work on and will continue to work on and we're learning all the time.
"We scored pretty well through pre-season and created chances and our strikers scored during that period.
"It's been three frustrating games."
Former Cardiff defender Steven Caulker's header and Tjarron Chery's late penalty secured victory for QPR at Cardiff City Stadium.
Trollope, appointed Russell Slade's replacement in May was also disappointed with the manner of the goals Cardiff conceded.
"They were two poor goals from our point of view, two set plays," Trollope added.
"They never really threatened us in open play at all but [there were] two poor decisions from our defenders.
"It was frustrating because when you've not quite created and not quite done your stuff at the top of the pitch you have to make sure you keep your back door shut.
"From open play we looked like we were managing to do that, even in that second period, but those two goals were really disappointing."
Cardiff host bottom of the table Blackburn Rovers on Wednesday with Owen Coyle's side having lost their opening two games of the season.
