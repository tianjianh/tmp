US reopens Somalia mission in Kenya

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The US has reopened its mission to Somalia, the latest step in restoring diplomatic ties since it withdrew from the country two decades ago.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The mission will be located in the US embassy in neighbouring Kenya. An ambassador has not yet been appointed.
The State Department said US officials would travel to Somalia when security conditions allowed.
The US withdrew from Somalia in 1993 after 18 American servicemen were killed in the capital, Mogadishu.
Hundreds of Somalis also died in the incident, known as Black Hawk Down.
