Ipswich made the brighter start but it was visitors Norwich who struck first, Cameron Jerome firing in off the post from the edge of the penalty area.
Denmark international full-back Knudsen found the net with a low shot with his weaker right foot to make it 1-1.
Norwich came closest to a winner but Steven Whittaker's effort hit the post.
Substitute Whittaker also saw a scuffed volley cleared off the line by Ipswich defender Adam Webster as the Canaries missed the chance to go top of the Championship.
Ipswich, whose last derby win came in April 2009, had a goal ruled out in the first three minutes, with Jonathan Douglas wrongly ruled to be in an offside position.
Both goals came against the run of play - Jerome's opener was Norwich's first meaningful attempt on goal, while the Canaries had exerted some control on the match before Knudsen netted for the home side.
Ipswich edged possession and territory after half-time and could have won it themselves but Michael McGovern saved from substitute Teddy Bishop after a defensive mix-up.
Ipswich Town manager Mick McCarthy told BBC Radio Suffolk: "I'm delighted with the performance, I thought we were the better team, conceded against the run of play and we responded well.
"I think somebody somewhere is in our debt. I'll be onto the PGMOL on Monday morning if what they say is right and (Jonathan Douglas) was onside. I haven't seen it yet.
"I need to get Teddy Bishop back playing. He can offer us what Hoolahan offers Norwich. He's got that lovely dip and swerve and goes past people for fun but he can't sustain that yet because he's been out nearly 12 months.
"I think we forget he's missed a huge part of his development. We need to get him as strong as he can be and then when he is he'll be a proper threat."
Norwich boss Alex Neil: "In terms of clear opportunities, we had the better ones. We didn't move the ball quickly enough though.
"We got better after the first 20 minutes. In the second half we should have moved the ball better though.
"It was a great finish from Cameron Jerome. He put a good shift in for us today. We had other chances too."
Chris Sutton, ex-Norwich striker on BBC Radio 5 live: "Ipswich shaded the game. Norwich hit the post through Whittaker but didn't do enough in forward areas.
"Ipswich had more energy, they were more direct.
"We want a winner in these games, but in the end, we've got an unsatisfactory draw."
