England Under-19 cap Rossiter, 19, has agreed a four-year deal.
"Jordan is an outstanding young England youth international who will be an excellent addition," manager Mark Warburton told the Rangers website.
"Technically gifted and game aware, he also has a first-class character and displays a tigerish desire to reach the highest levels of the game."
Rossiter made five first-team appearances for Liverpool after captaining and graduating from Liverpool's academy, including featuring against Sion in the Europa League - Jurgen Klopp's first game in charge of the Merseyside club.
Rangers won this season's Scottish Championship to gain promotion to the Premiership and will face Hibernian in the Scottish Cup final on 21 May.
