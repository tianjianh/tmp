North Tyneside Council is to demolish the old Whisky Bends pub, the former Avenue pub and 2 Eastcliffe, which includes the former High Point Hotel.
The three derelict properties are being removed as part of a wider rejuvenation of North Tyneside's seaside.
A council spokeswoman said she was "delighted" to see "real progress".
The council said it has also agreed to finalise negotiations with the owner of the former Wallsend police station.
The deal would allow Wallsend Town Hall to be used as a business centre and deliver land for affordable housing in the town centre.
Elected mayor Norma Redfearn said: "I know the people in both Whitley Bay and Wallsend have been so frustrated at the delays they have had to suffer over many years.
"I hope they will be delighted that they will eventually be able to see some real progress."
As part of the regeneration, tourist attraction Spanish City is to be restored and reopened thanks to a £3.7m Heritage Lottery Fund (HLF).
The moves were agreed at a meeting of the elected mayor and cabinet on Monday.
