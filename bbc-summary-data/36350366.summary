The report by UNRWA, the UN's agency for Palestinian refugees, warns that the education of thousands of children has been disrupted.
More than 300 UN schools were attacked or shut down.
In Syria, more than half of the UNWRA schools are no longer in use.
Some are destroyed, some cut off by fighting, others are shelters for displaced families.
Most schools have been looted and more than 400 teachers have fled Syria.

UNWRA head Pierre Kraehenbuehl called on all warring parties to respect the civilian character of schools, and to spare the lives of children, teachers, and aid workers.
The report emphasises how schools can provide stability and hope for children but this disruption has been having a profound impact.
The document, which also looks at damage to schools in Lebanon, Jordan and the Palestinian territories, will be presented on Monday at the World Humanitarian Summit in Istanbul where education will be a special focus.
