[SN]TITLE[SN]
Rotherham United 1-1 Blackburn Rovers

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Blackburn Rovers rescued a point thanks to Stephen Kelly's late own goal which denied Championship bottom side Rotherham a first win in five games.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Jon Taylor had crashed home Joe Newell's pass early in the second half to give the Millers hope of victory.
Rovers, for whom Jason Lowe hit the crossbar, found Richard O'Donnell a defiant barrier in the Rotherham goal.
But Kelly turned Connor Mahoney's corner into his own net to give Rovers a first away point since December.
Rovers arrived in South Yorkshire to face a Rotherham side 15 points adrift at the foot of the table, but Owen Coyle's team had their own concerns about the drop, lying just two places above them in the table.
Both had opportunities to score in the first half, with O'Donnell making some smart saves, while Tom Adeyemi got his feet tangled when trying to put a chance away for the Millers in the first half.
Taylor's goal put the home side in front, but also served to fire up Rovers, for whom Charlie Mulgrew's header was denied from a corner and Sam Gallagher fired over when well placed.
Danny Ward blasted a shot wide as Rotherham wasted a chance to double the lead and Rovers sent on Mahoney, who made a crucial impact with an inswinging corner which led to the equaliser.
Interim Rotherham manager Paul Warne:
"Unfortunately at the moment we can't keep a clean sheet so we need to score at least two to win.
"I just knew that we needed to score a second goal because there was a good chance we would concede.
"We didn't get the second goal when we were playing pretty good. Overall, I am frustrated.
"I am pleased that we have picked up a point but hugely disappointed that we have thrown away two."
Blackburn Rovers boss Owen Coyle:
"Every point in the league is vital, particularly away from home. The frustrating thing is that it was an opportunity to move out of the relegation zone.
"Over the course of the season we will be safe and fine. There is no question about that in my mind but days like today would help to make it sooner rather than later.
"I think we were certainly worth all three points. I felt we should have gone in at half-time a couple of goals in front.
"We made positive changes with our substitutions, got a grip of the game and should have equalised long before we did. We still then had chances to win the game thereafter."
