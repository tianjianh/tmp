Syria war: Russia announces partial Aleppo ceasefires

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Russian forces in Syria will suspend operations in the city of Aleppo from Thursday for three hours each day, its defence ministry has said.

The ministry said the pause would allow humanitarian aid to reach the city.
Intense fighting is continuing in Aleppo between rebels and the Syrian government forces, backed by Russian troops.
The United Nations however said the daily pause would not be enough to meet the needs of civilians in Aleppo.
It has demanded 48-hour weekly pauses for aid deliveries as intense fighting continues between rebels and Syrian government forces.
At least 250,000 people are believed to have been trapped in rebel-held areas of eastern Aleppo since a key route into the area was closed by government forces in early July.
On Sunday, rebels cut off the government's key access route into western Aleppo. They have since come under intense air bombardment from pro-government forces.
"To guarantee total security for the convoys to Aleppo there will be humanitarian windows established from 1000 to 1300 local time starting [on Thursday] during which all military hostilities, aviation strikes and artillery strikes will be halted," Lt Gen Sergei Rudskoi of the Russian army's  general staff said.
He said that more than 1,000 rebels had been killed and about 2,000 wounded in recent fighting over the past four days south-west of Aleppo.
Lt Gen Rudskoi said that a road had been constructed to an area on the northern outskirts of Aleppo to "ensure safety and organise round-the-clock delivery of food, water, fuel, medicine and other necessities to the city's west and east".
"We support the proposals by the UN to establish joint control over the delivery of humanitarian aid to the population of Aleppo along the Castello Road," he said.
The upsurge in fighting began in late June as government forces closed in on the Castello Road, the last route into rebel-held parts of the  city.
The UN's emergency relief co-ordinator says the Russian ceasefire window does not allow enough time for aid to get through.
"To meet that capacity of need, you need two lanes and you need to have about 48 hours to get sufficient trucks in," Stephen O'Brien told reporters.
A doctor in the city has told the BBC that he is now treating 150 casualties a day - more than double the number he was facing before an upsurge in fighting in recent days.
On Tuesday the UN called for an urgent ceasefire to help more than two million people who are in Aleppo without electricity and running water.
