Moses Pande, of Prinknash Road, Manchester, admitted six counts of sexual abuse at an earlier hearing at Manchester Crown Court.
The 23-year-old abused his victim between September 2014 and March this year, the court heard.
The girl was praised by police for the "bravery" she had shown in talking to officers about her ordeal.
Det Con Joanna Gordon, of Greater Manchester Police's Child Protection Unit, said she had been "robbed of her childhood and has had to go through the trauma of giving evidence".
She added: "The victim was terrified and I commend her bravery in speaking to us about the abuse she suffered at the hands of Pande."
