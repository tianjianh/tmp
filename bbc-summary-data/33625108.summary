Judith and John Woodget of Lockeridge in Marlbourgh, Wiltshire, crashed on the A303 at Sutton Scotney, near Winchester, on Sunday evening.
Mr Woodget, 64, died at the scene while his wife, 65, who was driving, died later in hospital.
Their family said: "The hole left in the family is unfathomable."
The statement continued: "They were a hugely caring, fun loving and inspirational couple.
"They constantly provided time, energy and help to so many people, from family and friends to the community and beyond."
The Wiltshire Community Foundation, of which Mr Woodget was chairperson, has set up a fund in their memory.
The lorry driver received minor injuries and was taken to hospital as a precaution.
