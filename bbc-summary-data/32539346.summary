[SN]TITLE[SN]
Ched Evans website will not face legal action

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
No action will be taken against a website supporting rapist Ched Evans following an inquiry into whether his victim was identified.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The case concerned whether the publication of pixelated CCTV footage meant a criminal offence had been committed.
But the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) ruled there was "nothing sufficiently distinctive" likely to identify her.
Evans and his supporters are trying to get his conviction overturned.
The disgraced Wales football international was jailed for five years in 2012 after being found guilty of raping a 19-year-old woman at a hotel near Rhyl, Denbighshire.
The 26-year-old was released last year after serving half of his sentence.
In January, the CPS was asked by the Attorney General to consider whether there was a case to answer.
CPS Wales chief crown prosecutor Ed Beltrami said it was "deemed unlikely that a member of the public could identify the victim and for that reason it was decided that there was insufficient evidence to charge".
