Hours after the last chord sounded at Glastonbury the great clean-up has begun.
The festival was brought to a close by Ed Sheeran on the Pyramid Stage, just six years after his debut at one of the festival's smallest venues.
He attracted a much younger audience than Friday and Saturday's headliners, Radiohead and Foo Fighters.
There is no Glastonbury in 2018, meaning there are 731 days until Worthy Farm opens its gates again.
