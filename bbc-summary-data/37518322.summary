New manager Gary Haveron has called on Glentoran's players to show pride in the shirt as they take on Belfast rivals Linfield on Saturday.

Former Carrick boss Haveron was appointed Glens supremo this week and could not have asked for a more high-profile first match in charge.
Glentoran have slumped to 10th in the table after taking just one point from a possible 15.
"We must show how much it means to play in games like these," said Haveron.
"Our fans expect the players to show passion and pride and that is how it should be.
"We have got to get a bit belief and a win would do that.
"The best way to turn our season around would be to beat Linfield on Saturday."
Despite being at home, Glentoran will be firm underdogs against David Healy's Linfield who are unbeaten this season.
The Belfast Blues sit in second place and are five points behind champions Crusaders with a match in hand.
The unbeaten Crues also face a big derby fixture as they host north Belfast neighbours Cliftonville at Seaview.
Crusaders have won five league matches in a row while Cliftonville are up to fourth following back-to-back victories.
"Cliftonville are back in form and are winning games of football quite well," said Crusaders manager Stephen Baxter.
"They are packed full of quality players and have loads of confidence and ability. They will expect to get a result."
Ballymena United travel to their fiercest rivals Coleraine looking to make it four wins in a row in the league.
They came from behind to beat Glentoran 4-1 last weekend to consolidate third place in the table.
"It will be my first experience of a Coleraine/Ballymena derby and we're looking forward to it," said Sky Blues boss David Jeffrey.
"They came from two down to draw against Glenavon last week so that is an indication of the character they possess."
The fourth derby clash in Saturday's Premiership is at Mourneview Park where Glenavon host Portadown.
Final Score from Northern Ireland is on BBC1 NI at 17:00 BST on Saturday
