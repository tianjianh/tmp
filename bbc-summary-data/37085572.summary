The 22-year-old suffered anterior cruciate ligament damage in a tackle by Castleford's Rangi Chase as the Warriors lost 36-22 on Friday.
Manfredi had been a regular for Wigan, who are third in the table, this season, scoring 15 tries in 25 games.
"I'm really gutted for him, he's a great player," said coach Shaun Wane.
"It's really sad but we've got a great medical department here and I'm sure he will bounce back stronger from it.
"The players are really motivated to get something from the season for him."
