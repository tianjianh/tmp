Four takeaways from James Comey's testimony

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
James Comey doesn't bury Donald Trump in the opening statement of his Thursday morning Senate testimony, but he digs a Trump-sized hole in the ground.

While the former FBI director dances around what, if anything, the ongoing investigation into possible Trump campaign Russian ties has found, he was much more forthcoming about his interactions with the president - and how they made him feel.
His statement makes for gripping reading, full of surprise one-to-one dinners, awkward silences and a cryptic mention of "that thing, you know".
He left drawing conclusions about the president's behaviour to others, but the picture he painted isn't a flattering one. Mr Trump may not have been scheming, but his efforts to draw a pledge of loyalty from his FBI director, his pleading for him to go easy on his former national security adviser and his repeated requests for assurances that he, personally, was not under investigation were ham-handed at best.
This, of course, is Mr Comey's moment, and it's his version of events that are in the spotlight. His descriptions have been (and will probably continue to be) vehemently disputed by the president and those who speak in his name.
It all sets up a he-said, he-said conflict. As Mr Comey himself acknowledges, during the key meetings with the president, the two men were the only ones in the room.
The former director, however, comes armed with a career reputation as a straight shooter - sometimes to a fault - who is willing to take what he views as the correct course even in the face of powerful adversaries. The president comes off a brawl of an election campaign, with more than half the American public doubtful of his very fitness for office.
Mr Comey in his statement also confirms he wrote numerous contemporaneous memos about his interactions with the president, which give additional heft to accounts.
Ever since the New York Times first reported that the president had urged his FBI director to go easy on Michael Flynn, his former campaign aide and short-lived national security adviser, Washington has been anxious to hear Mr Comey's take. Not from anonymous sources or friends, but from the former director himself.
It turns out his version is pretty much what had been reported up until now. Somewhere, reporters for the Times and the Washington Post are smiling.
"I hope you can see your way clear to letting this go, to letting Flynn go," Mr Comey says the president told him. "He is a good guy. I hope you can let this go."
The former director does take a bit of heat off the president when he goes on to note that he felt he was only being asked to back away from prosecuting Flynn for lying to federal agents about his December conversation with Russian Ambassador Sergei Kislyak.
"I did not understand the president to be talking about the broader investigation into Russia or possible links to his campaign," he says.
Still, the director discussed the issue with his FBI colleagues and notes that Mr Trump's request was "very concerning".
Comey to say Trump demanded his loyalty
The other big New York Times revelation that swept through the nation last month was that, in a one-on-one dinner shortly after his inauguration, Mr Trump reportedly asked Mr Comey to give him assurances that he would be loyal.
The president flatly denied this account of the dinner - but Mr Comey has now repeated it, under oath (with a twist).
His account sounds like a political haggling skit written by Monty Python.
Mr Comey told the president he would be "reliable". Mr Trump countered that he wanted - needed - "loyalty". The director says he froze, as though confronted by a wild beast while hiking in the woods.
"I didn't move, speak, or change my facial expression in any way during the awkward silence that followed," he says.
Finally, he offered "honesty".
Mr Trump countered with "honest loyalty" - a term on which they both agreed.
What, exactly, that means is anybody's guess.
In Mr Trump's letter firing Mr Comey, the president went out of his way to mention that the director had told him three times that he was not under direct FBI investigation.
That assertion raised eyebrows among legal experts, since such statements usually only come from prosecutors and not law enforcement officials.
Now, Mr Comey gives some context to those assurances.
During a 6 January meeting, Mr Comey informed President-elect Trump he wasn't the subject of a "counter-intelligence" investigation, which he said tends to look at whether Americans were "witting or unwitting agents" of foreign powers.
Where the dispute with the president arose, according to Mr Comey, was whether the FBI should make it clear Mr Trump wasn't in the investigatory crosshairs. The director was concerned if the FBI went public, it would "create a duty to correct, should that change".
That is, if Mr Trump eventually was swept up in the inquiry the FBI would have to make another public announcement, much like there was with the now-infamous October letter to Congress about the Clinton email investigation.
Another curious revelation buried in Mr Comey's testimony was that Mr Trump was less concerned about possible legal predicaments of his staff (Mr Flynn, it seems, being the notable exception).
"If there were some 'satellite' associates of his who did something wrong," Mr Comey said the president told him, "it would be good to find that out".
How those "satellite associates" might react to the president's supposed declaration - and what they might do if they eventually face criminal prosecution - will be an interesting question to ponder in the coming days.
What also is coming into focus this week is the strategy the White House will pursue to counter Mr Comey's testimony.
Rather than engage in a back-and-forth over details of the president's meetings with the director, it seems there is a two-part strategy.
The first is to claim that Mr Comey's testimony totally vindicates the president.
"The president is pleased that Mr Comey has finally publicly confirmed his private reports that the president was not under investigation in any Russian probe," the president's personal lawyer said.
As noted above, that's not exactly what Mr Comey said - but it's close enough for the White House, it seems.
The second prong of the strategy builds on the attacks the president launched last month, painting Mr Comey as a "showboater" and a "grandstander" - a man more obsessed with press clippings and the limelight than the FBI's role in defending national security.
This was the line explicitly advanced in a television advert funded by a pro-Trump political group that aired on cable news channels on Thursday, which criticises Mr Comey for meddling in US politics and ignoring terrorist threats and calls him "just another DC insider only in it for himself".
According to media reports, the president wholeheartedly endorses this bare-knuckles response to Mr Comey.
Given that the former director's testimony is going cast a shadow over the Trump presidency for months, if not years, the White House counterattack is almost certainly only just beginning.
The president's lawyer has made his statement - now all of Washington waits for the inevitable presidential tweet-storm.
