[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Neither team had won a match this season before Monday night's encounter, and the Welsh side recovered from a slow start to win comfortably.
Goal shoot Afa Rusivakula was on target 48 times as Dragons opened an eight point lead in the third quarter before pulling away in the final 15.
The result leaves Jets rooted to the bottom with zero points.
