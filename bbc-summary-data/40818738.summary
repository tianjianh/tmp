The 34-year-old was a free agent after leaving Pompey at the end of last season and links up with his former boss Paul Cook at the Latics.
"His experience, commitment and quality has already started rubbing off on the squad," Cook told Wigan's website.
"He's a player who trains as he plays, at 100%, and he will make a significant contribution on and off the field."
