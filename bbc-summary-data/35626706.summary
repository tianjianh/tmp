Reports a man had fallen in the Strand in Torquay were made to emergency services at 18:50 GMT on Saturday.
A Devon and Cornwall Police spokesman said the injured man was taken by land ambulance to Plymouth's Derriford Hospital.
He said officers were yet to speak to the man and were unsure of the circumstances of the fall.
The spokesman added that poor weather conditions had prevented the man being taken to the hospital by air ambulance.
