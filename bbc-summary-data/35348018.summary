More victims were said to be trapped in the rubble of the collapsed two-storey building, which was hit overnight.
Most of those killed were policemen and members of the Houthi rebel movement, which the coalition has been bombarding in support of Yemen's government.
One report said rebels sometimes used the building as an assembly point.
On Sunday morning, a Yemeni journalist was killed in an air strike outside Sanaa.
Almigdad Mojalli was targeted by coalition jets while on assignment for Voice of America at the scene of an air strike that killed several civilians last week.
At least eight journalists and news media workers have been killed covering the conflict in the past year, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists
Air strikes and fighting on the ground in Yemen have killed 5,800 people, about half of them civilians, since the coalition began a military campaign to restore the internationally-recognised government in late March, according to the UN.
The already dire humanitarian situation in Yemen has also deteriorated severely, with more than 21 million people - four-fifths of the population - now requiring aid.
