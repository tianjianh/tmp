A woman with terminal cancer is set to tie the knot with her fiancÃ© after many offers of help made the wedding possible.

Sarah Lowndes, from Derby, was told she had breast cancer several years ago and it has since spread.
She and fiancÃ© David Moore say they have been overwhelmed by kindness after they received free catering, flowers, a wedding dress and venue hire.
Ms Lowndes, who has two children, said the family was "very excited".
She and Mr Moore, who met driving buses, have been unable to fund their wedding due to her illness.
They enlisted the help of a charity called Wish for a Wedding, which provides help for couples dealing with terminal illness.
The 40-year-old said: "I can't believe that so many people donated something for someone they didn't know."
She was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2010, meeting Mr Moore two years later.
However, in 2013, Ms Lowndes was told the cancer had returned and had spread to her bones and liver.
She had to give up her job as a bus driver to undergo chemotherapy.
"I feel fine, just tired," she said. "I have to have treatment every three weeks, but we're all excited and my children are bouncing off the walls."
Alison Walker, from the charity, said the wedding had been a challenge as she only had eight weeks to help make it possible.
"It feels like I have made life-long friends," she said.
"It's a bit emotional for me too as I have a lot of family history of breast and ovarian cancer, so it means a lot to me that I was able to do this for them."
The wedding is due to take place at Makeney Hall, in Milford, Derbyshire, on Friday.
