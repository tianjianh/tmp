[SN]TITLE[SN]
Watford v Tottenham Hotspur

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Watford head coach Walter Mazzarri says he could be without up to nine first-team players for Saturday's visit of Tottenham.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Valon Behrami, Daryl Janmaat, Adrian Mariappa, Roberto Pereyra, Isaac Success, Ben Watson and Miguel Britos are definitely out, while Stefano Okaka and Craig Cathcart are doubts.
Tottenham defenders Jan Vertonghen and Kyle Walker are both suspended.
Toby Alderweireld returns after a virus, but Eric Lamela remains out.
Steve Wilson: "Tottenham bring up the halfway point of their season at Vicarage Road, just as they did last year, when they won 2-1 thanks to Son Heung-min's late goal.
"They should certainly make the short trip with confidence after ending a run of eight away games without a win by overcoming Southampton at St Mary's.
"Whilst Spurs points tally is a little better than at this stage last season, Watford are seven points worse off. Perhaps most tellingly of all is that the Odion Ighalo/Troy Deeney strike partnership had scored 19 Premier League goals then - and only five now.
"Speaking of goals, have a look at Glenn Hoddle's chip for Spurs at Watford from September 1983 - it should keep you smiling long into 2017."

Watford head coach Walter Mazzarri on his side's injury list: "The club knows already the situation.
"We will try to get some players in as soon as possible. January is very difficult, you need to think of not getting players for only a few months, but also about the future.
"The club knows what to do and we will try to do it as soon as possible."
Tottenham Hotspur manager Mauricio Pochettino: "For us the most important game is Watford to try and reduce the gap on the top four.
"We need to be focused on Watford, that's the most important thing for us.
"Chelsea are a long way ahead. It will be tough for all the contenders. They have a good gap to second and 10 points to us but we'll fight to reduce the gap."
Even before Tottenham put four goals past Southampton I looked at Spurs and thought they have just got something about them at the moment.
Watford, in contrast, looked ordinary in their draw with Crystal Palace. I don't see them stopping Tottenham from making it four wins in a row.
