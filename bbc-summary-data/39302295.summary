Fitness trackers for pets are becoming more and more popular especially in Hong Kong.
It allows owners to keep track of how much their pets are eating, how much exercise they're doing and also how much they sleep.
It's put on their collar and then the owner looks on their phone to see how active their pets been.
I hope they've done their 10,000 steps!
