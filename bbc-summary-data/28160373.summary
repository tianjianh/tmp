The Bank of England has decided to break with tradition and cancel the annual cricket match that has for years provided the focal point for the Bank's annual summer party.

Staff were given the chance to choose what they wanted to do, and cricket did not feature high on their wish list.
The match will be replaced by rounders, football and egg-and spoon races.
The summer party takes place at the Bank's sports ground in Roehampton in south-west London on Sunday.
"The governor has not banned cricket," a spokesperson for the Bank said.
"He wanted the activities at Governors' Day to be chosen by staff for staff and their families. Staff chose a number of sports, such as rounders, football and tug of war, among others."
Former governor Sir Mervyn King is a huge cricket fan and played in the Bank's game every year, often against a team comprising professional cricketers.
The Bank's annual cricket match pre-dates Sir Mervyn's tenure as governor.
