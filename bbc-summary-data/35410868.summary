Cunningham, 39, led Saints to the semi-finals of both the Challenge Cup and Super League play-offs in his first season in charge.
He spent his entire playing career with his hometown team before moving onto the coaching staff in 2010.
"Keiron is a young, talented and ambitious British coach," said chairman Eamonn McManus.
"Even at the very beginning of his career he has already won the absolute respect of his team and of all at his club.
"In his first season he took the team to within a whisker of another Grand Final and against the background of an injury ravaged campaign. He will continue to gain experience, as will his young side."
The former Wales and Great Britain hooker made his St Helens debut in 1994 and went on to make 495 appearances at the club.
