Ledley has been doing individual sessions as he bids to recover from a broken leg suffered on 7 May.
He is joined on the sidelines by Liverpool goalkeeper Danny Ward, who has suffered a knee injury.
Preston goalkeeper Chris Maxwell has travelled to the Welsh training camp in the Algarve as a precaution but Wales expect Ward to be fit for the Euros.
Wales manager Chris Coleman names his 23-man squad on 31 May, cutting his group from the 29-players originally named for the training camp.
Ledley suffered a broken leg on 7 May and Coleman is giving him until the last minute to prove his fitness.
Wales goalkeeper Wayne Hennessey is confident his Crystal Palace team-mate is winning his battle to be fit for Wales' opening game against Slovakia on 11 June.
"He's putting all his effort into it. I hope he is in the Euros and I am sure he will be. He is a fit and strong guy and always in shape," Hennessey told BBC Radio Wales.
"He will be fitter than he was. He is progressing really well, hopefully he can play in our first game.
"We miss his dance moves."
Midfielder Joe Allen and striker Tom Bradshaw have both travelled with the squad to Portugal, but have not started training due to their late ends to the season with Liverpool and Walsall respectively.
