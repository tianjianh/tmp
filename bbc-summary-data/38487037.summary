[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The daughter of the woman at the centre of a presidential scandal in South Korea has been arrested in Denmark, say South Korean police.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Chung Yoo-ra, 20, is accused of staying in Denmark illegally, they said. They have requested her extradition.
Her mother is accused of using her friendship with President Park Geun-hye for personal gain. Both women apologised but denied the accusations.
After weeks of protest, parliament voted on 9 December to impeach Ms Park.
One of the ways in which Ms Chung's mother, Choi Soon-sil, is alleged to have mis-used her friendship with the president is by getting Ms Chung into a top Korean university.

A friendship too far in Seoul?
South Korean authorities had asked for Interpol's help in tracing Ms Chung - a former member of the national equestrian team - after she failed to return to answer questions about her role in the scandal.
Her mother Ms Choi is in detention having returned from abroad to face questioning.
She has been charged with various offences, including abuse of authority, coercion, attempted coercion and attempted fraud.
South Korea's constitutional court has six months to uphold or overturn the impeachment vote against Ms Park.
Until then she remains formally president but stripped of her powers, which have been handed to the prime minister, a presidential appointee.
