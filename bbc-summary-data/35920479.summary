The 20-year-old, who has signed a two-and-a-half-year contract, had been linked with a move to Norwich City.
"Luke was a player I watched whilst at Luton because he was at Dunstable," said Daggers boss John Still.
"I was under the impression he had gone to Norwich, but as soon as I knew he was still available I tried to do something about it."
Pennell was previously on MK Dons' books and had spells at Rushden & Diamonds and Banbury United before joining Dunstable at the beginning of the season.
