Staffing crisis closed emergency unit at Nairn hospital

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A staffing crisis forced NHS Highland to close an accident and emergency unit on Christmas day, it has emerged.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Anyone seeking treatment at Nairn Town and County Hospital between 13:00 and 19:30 would have been diverted to either Raigmore Hospital in Inverness or Doctor Gray's in Elgin.
NHS Highland said the decision had not been taken lightly.
A spokesman said it had taken the move as a "contingency measure" due to a lack of staffing cover.
