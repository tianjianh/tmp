A glitch on Google Maps has located the Brecon Beacons in the heart of London.

The technical error has directed people searching for the national park more than 150m (241km) away to a location between Chelsea and Knightsbridge.
Brecon Beacons National Park Authority posted the image online with the caption: "We have now moved. Londoners get an upgrade thanks to Google Maps."
Chief executive John Cook joked: "Well the move has come as a bit of a shock to us all."
He added: "I'm sure it will come as good news to Londoners who want some fresh mountain air on their doorstep.
"The truth is we are only three hours away from London - don't rely on your sat-nav or Google Maps - just head to Bristol on the M4, cross the bridge, ask a local and they'll know exactly where to find us."
