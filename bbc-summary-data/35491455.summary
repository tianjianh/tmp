Mansfield and Yeovil players take unusual approaches to rehab

Players from League Two rivals Mansfield and Yeovil have taken unconventional approaches to the rehabilitation of injured players.

Stags defender Mal Benning has revealed he was so keen to make a swift return from a cruciate knee ligament injury, he tested it by tackling a brick wall.
It paid off as the 22-year-old made his comeback at Crawley Town last Saturday.
Meanwhile, Yeovil keeper Artur Krysiak, 26, was sent to swim in the sea because an ice bath was unavailable.
The Polish shot-stopper picked up a knock in the Glovers' draw with Luton Town on Tuesday, and is doubtful for this weekend's visit of Plymouth Argyle.
Benning, who joined Mansfield from Walsall in the summer, scored three goals from left-back in 14 League Two appearances before suffering his injury in October.
"It was just that last little bit where my confidence wasn't there tackling-wise," he told BBC Radio Nottingham "So I thought 'why not do a bit of that at home?'"
The former Walsall trainee said his imaginative rehabilitation had helped him gain both belief and strength as he seeks to rediscover his form.
"I just put a ball against the wall and smashed the ball as hard as I could," explained Benning. "It was just against the wall to make sure my knee got used to it.
"I had three months of doing leg weights but my knee wasn't used to that movement, so I needed to get that back. Even when I started running I still had twinges in it.
"I have got back in my routine now after two weeks of training. It's great to be back."
Yeovil's regular facilities at Bath university were unavailable for Krysiak, so manager Darren Way sent him to brave water temperatures of about 10 degrees C at West Bay beach.
The Glovers are hoping for a swift recovery by Krysiak, with Chris Weale the only other senior goalkeeper in the squad.
"Artur has been icing his injury with the Game Ready device and will be going to Bath University to use their hydro pool," Way told the club website.
"Unfortunately this wasn't available today, so the next best thing was the sea at West Bay and fingers crossed it will help be fit for the weekend."
