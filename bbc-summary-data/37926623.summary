The Rochdale youngster was diagnosed with a brain tumour last year and was told it was terminal in September.
Joshua will not be able to attend the game at Northern Gas and Power Stadium on Wednesday but will have a shirt hung up in the changing room and will be named as one of Dale's seven substitutes, with the squad number 55.
"He has touched the hearts of everyone at Rochdale since we met him for the first time back in February," manager Keith Hill told the club website.
"No child should have to go through what Joshua is going through and we, as a club and a group of players, will continue to do whatever we can to support him and his family.
"We hope this one small gesture can bring some light to his family during this difficult time."
