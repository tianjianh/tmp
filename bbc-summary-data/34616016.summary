CHAN 2016: Guinea beat Senegal and Angola eliminate South Africa

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Guinea and Angola caused the biggest shocks of the weekend so far as they qualified for the finals of the 2016 African Nations Championship (CHAN) in Rwanda.

Guinea qualified for the tournament for locally based players for the first time after three failed attempts by eliminating Senegal.
Angola lost at home to South Africa in the second leg of their qualifier, but still managed to progress thanks to an aggregate victory.
Hosts Senegal came from behind against Guinea on Saturday to triumph 3-1, but went out on away goals after losing the first leg 2-0 last weekend.
Zambia, Gabon and Mali also booked places at the biennial tournament, which Rwanda hosts from 16 January to 7 February next year.
(Ties played over two legs, home and away, except in Northern Zone)
Goals from Aboubacar Mouctar Sylla and Aboubacar Iyanga  Sylla gave Guinea a 2-0 first-leg advantage over Senegal a week ago in a game switched to Mali because of the Ebola epidemic.
That advantage stretched to three goals just three minutes into the return match on an artificial surface at Stade Demba Diop in Dakar when Aboubacar Bangoura scored.
Sylvain Badji triggered a Senegalese recovery with a 13th minute goal and a late second-half brace from Ibrahima Sory Keita set up a tense climax.
A makeshift South African side regained some pride after a two-goal first leg defeat by snatching a stoppage time victory over Angola in Luanda in their return leg, although Angola went through 3-2 on aggregate.
After Fabricio Mafuta conceded an own goal, the hosts levelled before half-time when 'Gelson' - or Jacinto Muondo Dala - punished slack marking to fire past goalkeeper Wayne Sandilands.
Lyle Lakay scored the second leg winner six minutes into additional time off a fiercely-struck free kick that went in off the woodwork.
South African clubs refused to release national stars as CHAN matches are not staged on Fifa international dates, forcing coach Thabo Senong to pick out-of-favour first and second division footballers.
Gatoch Panom was a two-goal hero for Ethiopia as they came back from a 2-0 first leg deficit against Burundi to win 3-0 in Addis Ababa.
The midfielder scored twice within seven minutes to help Ethiopia go through 3-2 on aggregate.
Zambia booked their place in Rwanda with a 1-1 draw in Mozambique, giving Chipolopolo a 4-1 win on aggregate.
Festus Mbewe put Zambia ahead in the second leg, with Momed Hagi hitting a late consolation for the hosts from the penalty spot.
Gabon losing 1-0 to Chad in Libreville was a shock after they built a comfortable first-leg advantage in N'Djamena, although Gabon went through 2-1 overall.
Nassor Ndiguem scored on 70 minutes for the Chadians, but the visitors failed to strike again and force the tie into a penalty shootout.
Nigeria drew 0-0 away to Burkina Faso, but it was enough for the Super Eagles to go through 2-0 on aggregate.
Mali made the perfect start in Nouakchott with Moussa Bakayoko scoring five minutes into the opening half to cancel the 'away' goal Mauritania brought back from Bamako.
Mama Niass equalised on the stroke of half-time and a goalless second half gave the visitors overall success.
Democratic Republic of Congo, Morocco and Tunisia have also qualified and Rwanda are automatic entrants as hosts.
Two other second legs have been delayed until next week because of presidential elections in Ivory Coast and a presidency-related referendum in Congo Brazzaville.
