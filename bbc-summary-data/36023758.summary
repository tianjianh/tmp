The Right Reverend Steven Croft will leave his role as the Bishop of Sheffield to take up his new position.

The Diocese of Oxford has been without a permanent bishop since the Right Rev John Pritchard stepped down in October 2014.
Interviews of potential candidates were held in 2015, but the Archbishop of Canterbury said the Crown Nominations Commission - which elects bishops - had "been unable to discern the candidate whom God is calling".
The Bishop of Dorchester, the Right Rev Colin Fletcher, acted as bishop of the diocese in lieu of a full-time post holder.
