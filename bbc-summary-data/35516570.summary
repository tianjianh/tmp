Six Nations 2016: Wales fret over fly-half Dan Biggar

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Fly-half Dan Biggar is a doubt for Wales' Six Nations clash against Scotland in Cardiff on Saturday after limping off against Ireland.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Rhys Priestland deputised for almost an hour of their draw in Dublin.
Wales coach Warren Gatland said: "It looks like he's got a sprain quite high up on the ankle. We'll know a bit more in the next 24-48 hours."
Gareth Anscombe (hamstring) withdrew before kick-off in Dublin and Liam Williams came in at full-back.
Scarlets' Williams was omitted from Wales' initial selection having played once since injuring a foot at the 2015 World Cup.
Wales opted not to bring replacement Rhys Priestland into the starting line-up.
After the final whistle, Biggar was using a crutch to help support his weight.
Anscombe returned from his own ankle problem for Cardiff Blues in January, having also last played at the World Cup. Wales say Anscombe is "expected to take part in full training" before the next game.
Gatland's side have only six days before they play Scotland, and are due to announce their team on Wednesday so could face a difficult choice at fly-half.
Anscombe would be a candidate provided he is fit, while Gatland was happy with Priestland's contribution in Dublin.
"I though Rhys has done pretty well when he's come on and we were happy with his performance," he said.
He added that he was not clear on Biggar's prognosis.
"Whether it's got to be scanned or not I don't know. It's difficult to make those assessments an hour after the game," he added.
