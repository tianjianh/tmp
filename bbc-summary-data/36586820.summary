Southend United: Jason Demetriou & Jermaine McGlashan join

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Southend have signed right-back Jason Demetriou and former Gillingham winger Jermaine McGlashan on two-year deals.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Former Leyton Orient player Demetriou, 28, joined Walsall last summer after playing for five years in Cyprus.
Capped 28 times by Cyprus, he played 53 times for Walsall in 2015-16 as they lost in the League One play-off semi-finals, but rejected a new deal.
McGlashan, also 28, was released by the Gills after scoring seven goals in 67 appearances over two seasons.
His contract has the option of a third year and he will face his former side in both of Southend's opening fixtures of the season, with the Essex side hosting Gillingham in both League One on the opening day and in the EFL Cup three days later.
