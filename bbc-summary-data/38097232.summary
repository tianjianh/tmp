Andy has been at the helm of the Coleraine FC Academy since it was set up in 2008, providing a wide range of activities for thousands of people.
He has also spearheaded the local Small-Sided Games Centre.
It now has more than 1,000 children between the ages of seven and 12 playing on 16 pitches.
In addition, Andy is chairperson of the Harry Gregg Foundation, named in honour of the former Manchester United and Northern Ireland goalkeeper.
Andy and his 80-strong team of Foundation volunteers have been at the forefront of developing a range of community projects in the area including mental health, first aid, child protection training and working with Coleraine Special Olympics.
"I am humbled and very proud to have been nominated by my fellow volunteers, all of whom must share in this accolade," said Andy.
"To see how popular and readily established the work of the Harry Gregg Foundation has become is satisfaction in itself. It works on the very simple principle of creating opportunities which may just inspire dreams."
Alison Wallace , who nominated Andy, described the award winner as an inspiration.
"He has selflessly devoted his spare time to innovatively lead and inspire programmes that have seen thousands of youngsters develop their sporting and social abilities, and at the same time being a husband, father and holding down a full-time job."
Harry Gregg said: "The coaches give their time for the future and benefit of children. What they do every Saturday morning is incredible, helping thousands of young boys and girls.
"I am so proud of it. It is giving the chance for children to progress and express themselves through football."

Last year's Northern Ireland winner, Damien Lindsay, went on to lift the overall UK award at the event which was held in Belfast.
