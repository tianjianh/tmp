Brexit: Single market a top priority for Leanne Wood

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Plaid Cymru leader Leanne Wood has issued a list of demands for Wales, as the prime minister prepares to trigger Brexit negotiations.

They include "continued participation" in the single market and ensuring EU aid for Wales is fully replaced.
Ms Wood called for further devolution and for the rights of all EU nationals living in Wales to be guaranteed.
But the Conservatives said her Welsh independence campaign would break up the "vital single market" of the UK.
Theresa May launches negotiations on Wednesday under Article 50, by writing to the European Council president.
The letter will begin a two-year process to agree the terms of the UK's departure from the EU, and to outline of the UK's future relationship with the remaining 27 EU members.
Ms Wood said:  "Our alternative demands for the Article 50 letter reflect not only what is important to Wales and everyone who lives here, but the promises that were made to voters by the Vote Leave campaign.
"They offer the UK Prime Minister a list of sensible and moderate options that do not go against the mandate to leave the EU but protect our vital economic links with the continent and reflect the interests of Wales and all who live here."
A Welsh Conservative spokesman said: "The British public voted to leave the European Union and that vote was endorsed by the people of Wales, giving the Westminster Government a mandate to negotiate on behalf of the whole of the UK.
"Leanne Wood purports to be acting in the national interest, but there is an inherent irony in her demands to retain access to the single market and for the maintenance of current funding levels - whilst simultaneously campaigning for independence from the UK, which would see the taps turned off for our public services and break up a vital single market."
Welsh Labour MEP Derek Vaughan said the UK government had "backed itself into a corner by setting conditions which indicate we are heading for hard Brexit or no deal".
This, he warned, would be "catastrophic" for Wales.
"It's time for Theresa May to do what's best for Wales and the UK rather than catering to the far right at the expense of our future," he said.
UKIP published "six key tests to prove Brexit means Exit", including a requirement that "Parliament must resume its supremacy of law-making with no impediments, qualifications or restrictions on its future actions".
The party called for the UK to have full control of its immigration, asylum and border control policies and the seas around its coast, insisting there should be no final settlement payment to the EU or any ongoing payments.
