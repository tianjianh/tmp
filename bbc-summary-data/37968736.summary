Joe Truman, Ryan Owens and Jack Carlin claimed the men's team sprint on Friday. Chris Latham won silver in the men's scratch and Emily Kay matched that result in the women's omnium.
Barker said: "I'm very, very happy. It was a tough race with some really strong riders. That is probably the best I've ever performed in a points race tactically, so I'm very proud."
On Saturday, Ireland's Mark Downey won the men's points race gold.
