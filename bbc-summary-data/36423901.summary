[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A burst water main in Eastleigh has caused flooding in a road and left about 4,000 homes without water.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Southern Water said the pipe burst in Chestnut Avenue had affected homes in the SO53 and SO16 postcodes leaving them with no water or low pressure.
The company said supplies would gradually return to normal later as the main was being repaired.
Chestnut Avenue is expected to remain closed until Friday as the burst had caused substantial damage.
Engineers have closed off the road between the Bournemouth Road junction and the Tollgate junction.
