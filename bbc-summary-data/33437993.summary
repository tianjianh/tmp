Australian Opposition leader Bill Shorten said he would "relish" the chance to defend his record when he faces a Royal Commission on Wednesday.

Mr Shorten will be asked questions about deals stuck when he was a union boss.
The commission has been examining questionable agreements between unions and employers.
It was established last year after the government announced a crackdown on alleged wrongdoing by union officials.
The highly-anticipated appearance will be a crucial test for Mr Shorten after Prime Minister Tony Abbott challenged him to explain the questionable practices raised in the commission hearings.
Mr Shorten's public popularity is currently at its lowest since he became opposition leader in 2013.
The commission will focus on deals struck with employers when Mr Shorten was Victorian state secretary of the Australian Workers Union (AWU) between 1998 and 2006.
Previously, the commission heard one of these deals saved a cleaning company A$2m ($1.5m, Â£963,000) but was detrimental to workers.
Mr Shorten was also national secretary of the AWU - one of the largest unions in Australia - from 2001 to 2007.
"I relish the opportunity to talk about what I believe to be every Australian's right - a good, safe job with proper pay and conditions," Mr Shorten said in a statement.
"I'll put my record against Tony Abbott's anytime - today, tomorrow, any day of the week," he said.
Mr Shorten is also expected to face questions over more than A$1m in payments made to the Victorian branch of the AWU by employers between 2004 and 2007, local media reports said.
There have also been claims a construction company paid its employees' union fees to boost the union's numbers as part of a deal struck while Mr Shorten was in charge.
