Election fraud: Politically correct sentiment a problem, report says

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Politically correct sensibilities have led the authorities to turn a blind eye to electoral corruption in the UK, a report on the issue has suggested.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Former communities secretary Sir Eric Pickles said fraud may be overlooked because of "over-sensitivities about ethnicity and religion".
He also said voters should provide proof of identity at polling stations.
His review was commissioned by David Cameron in the wake of the Tower Hamlets election fraud scandal in 2015.
In Sir Eric's report, which took 12 months to complete, he argues that "politically correct sensibilities" meant a blind eye was too often turned to voting irregularities in Pakistani or Bangladeshi communities in particular.
Sir Eric's report said he had seen evidence of "pressure being put on vulnerable members of some ethnic minority communities, particularly women and young people, to vote according to the will of the elders, especially in communities of Pakistani and Bangladeshi background.
"There were concerns that influence and intimidation within households may not be reported, and that state institutions had turned a blind eye to such behaviour because of 'politically correct' over-sensitivities about ethnicity and religion."
Among his 50 recommendations, he recommends
In an Election Court hearing last year Lutfur Rahman was found guilty of election fraud, and was subsequently forced to step down as the mayor of Tower Hamlets in east London.
Mr Rahman was accused of using "corrupt and illegal practices", and Election Commissioner Richard Mawrey made findings during the trial to suggest that grants had been given to Bangladeshi or Muslim groups in return for support.
Mr Mawrey - who sat as a judge - said Mr Rahman, who has previously denied any wrongdoing, had "driven a coach and horses through election law and didn't care".
However, earlier this year a Met Police investigation concluded it had found "insufficient evidence" that any criminal offences were committed.
Sir Eric said: "Last year's court ruling in Tower Hamlets was a wake-up call that state bodies need to do far more to stamp out corruption and restore public confidence. It was local residents who lost out from the unscrupulous politicians who bullied them and wasted their money.
"Our nation has a proud heritage as the 'mother of parliaments', yet the worrying and covert spread of electoral fraud and state of denial by some bodies threatens that good reputation. It is time to take action to take on the electoral crooks and defend Britain's free and fair elections."
Sir Eric also expressed his dismay that criminal charges were not brought in the Tower Hamlets case, but the Met Police said there had been a "lengthy criminal investigation" before the decision not to prosecute was taken.
