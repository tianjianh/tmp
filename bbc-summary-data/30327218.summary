'Sexy' lollipop patrol's road safety message

"Sexy" lollipop men and women are being used in a road safety campaign aimed at pedestrians who have been drinking.

The move is targeting young adults who are more likely to wander across roads while drunk.
A video, filmed in Oxford, appeared to show more pedestrians used a zebra crossing when accompanied by the scantily-dressed models.
Nearly 150 drunk pedestrians have been killed or injured in Berkshire, Hampshire and Oxfordshire since 2009.
As part of the campaign, nearly 400 pedestrians were secretly filmed crossing Cowley Road, an area which has many bars and is popular with students.
When the patrol was not there, more than 40% did not use the crossing but that fell to 8% when the models were ushering pedestrians across at the zebra.
Dan Campsall, of Road Safety Analysis, who developed the campaign for Thames Valley Safer Roads Partnership, said observing the behaviour of those using the crossing, showed some were "clearly drunk".
He said: "When people have had some drinks, when they are crossing to the kebab shop or next pub, they just think in straight lines.
"Something that disrupts that behaviour and gathers them to a safer crossing place does seem to have an effect."
Nationally 3,164 pedestrians who were considered to be impaired by alcohol, were killed or seriously injured between 2009-2013.
Mr Campsall admitted the crossing patrol models were not a practical solution on night time streets, although it is hoped the video - titled #sexycrossingpatrol -  will raise awareness on social media.
"The key thing is to highlight the issue. At this time of year we put a lot of emphasis about not getting behind the wheel of the car after drinking, but you can be just as vulnerable if you are drunk and walking."
