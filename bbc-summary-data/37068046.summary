[SN]TITLE[SN]
Dover Athletic 3-1 Barrow

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Dover made it three wins on the bounce in the National League with a comfortable 3-1 triumph over Barrow.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Moses Emmanuel got the breakthrough for Dover on the half-hour mark, smashing home after Aswad Thomas' fluffed effort on goal fell kindly for the former Bromley forward.
Ross Lafayette made it 2-0 after 56 minutes, smartly lifting the ball over Joel Dixon, and Sam Magri's header made it 3-0 with eight minutes left.
Barrow substitute Ross Hannah scored a consolation penalty in the 89th minute. Paul Cox's side had shown signs of growing into the game early on in the second half, but their two-match unbeaten run is now over at the expense of Dover's impressive winning streak.
