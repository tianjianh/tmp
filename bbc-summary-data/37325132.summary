[SN]TITLE[SN]
Ipswich Town 0-0 Aston Villa

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Aston Villa held on to claim a point at Ipswich and secure a fifth draw from their eight Championship games.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Freddie Sears went close to winning the game for Town late on, striking the post deep into injury time.
The striker also went close with two free-kicks and Villa's Jonathan Kodjia turned away attempts by substitute Leon Best and Cole Skuse on the goal line.
Jordan Ayew had Villa's best chance, when he was blocked by Adam Webster with the goal at his mercy.
Since being relegated and having broken the Championship transfer record to sign Kodjia, Villa have managed to win only once in the league this season.
And, having conceded goals in the last six minutes of four matches, Roberto di Matteo's side were lucky not to do so again.
Sears saw one of his free-kicks deflected wide, while the other was saved by Pierluigi Gollini, and Kodjia came to the rescue defensively with his two goal-line clearances.
Jack Grealish, Ashley Westwood and Ayew all had attempts blocked but the Ghanaian should have put Villa ahead early in the second half when he rounded keeper Bartosz Bialkowski before being denied by Webster's challenge.
Ipswich manager Mick McCarthy: "I think it was a fair result and I was pleased with the performance and how we played against an expensively assembled team of very good players.
"We could have won it at the end but if that was my side, I would have said 'great defending' so you have to give Villa credit.
"My players gave everything and I can trust them to do that and leave nothing behind in every match. That is a really nice thing for a manager to know week-in, week-out.
"We may not always play well but it is never because we haven't tried."
Aston Villa boss Roberto Di Matteo: "I don't think it was a boring 0-0. We were resilient and defended well against the threat of Ipswich.
"We were better on the ball in the first half as we tried to create a bit of danger and we had some half-chances.
"The second half was a bit more difficult but it was a good solid performance at a place that is always difficult to play at.
"A point away from home is always a good point and I am pleased with how we fought until the end."
