Seven children and two adults were injured when the Tsunami ride derailed at M&D's in Strathclyde Park, near Motherwell, at about 15:37 on Sunday.
Three boys and a man remain in hospital in Glasgow. Two of the boys are said to be in a serious condition.
Two boys and a girl are to be allowed home from Wishaw Hospital later.
Nine passengers were on board the Tsunami inverted rollercoaster when five gondolas detached from their rails at a bend and fell to the ground.
A total of 10 people were taken to hospitals in Glasgow and Wishaw in the aftermath of the crash, although a 25-year-old woman was found not to be injured and released following an assessment.
The nine injured included a man and woman, both aged 19, and seven children.
Two boys remain in a serious condition at the Royal Hospital for Children in Glasgow - a 12-year-old with chest, abdominal and leg injuries and an 11-year-old who suffered serious arm and hand injuries.
Another boy, aged 11, is in a stable condition at the same hospital.
The 19-year-old man, who suffered a knee injury, remains in a stable condition at Glasgow Royal Infirmary.
The three children who are expected to be discharged from Wishaw General Hospital are a 14-year-old girl who suffered chest injuries, a 16-year-old boy who injured his arm and a boy, aged 11, who was kept in for observation.
Police have launched a joint investigation with the Health and Safety Executive into the crash and the park remains closed.
They have also appealed for anyone who witnessed the crash, or has images and videos of the incident, to contact them at the dedicated email address: rollercoaster@scotland.pnn.police.uk
The park's director, Douglas Taylor, said on Monday that every ride was "safety checked on a daily basis" and underwent "a thorough independent inspection every 12 months".
The incident was not the first safety issue to have affected rides at M&D's.
In March, eight people had to be rescued by firefighters when the park's Tornado rollercoaster ground to a halt 20 ft (6m) in the air.
In July 2011, nine people were rescued from the park's Tsunami rollercoaster after being trapped for up to eight hours. The malfunction was blamed on a broken lift chain.
In 2006, firefighters freed 18 people who were trapped upside down on a fairground ride at M&D's.
