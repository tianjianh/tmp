Wales captain Ashley Williams says there is no cause for alarm despite failing to beat Israel to secure a place at the Euro 2016 finals.

Thursday's 1-0 win in Cyprus meant Wales could have qualified with victory over Israel on Sunday, but they could only manage a 0-0 draw in Cardiff.
However, one more point against Bosnia-Herzegovina or Andorra will be enough.
"We still have two games to go and it's still on us. We're still top of the group so there's no panic," he said.
"We just keep the momentum going into the next two games."
Wales dominated Israel, who they had beaten 3-0 away earlier in the campaign, but were unable to find a way through.
Chris Coleman's side had a couple of penalty claims waved away by the officials, while substitute Simon Church had an injury-time goal ruled out for offside,
"I think we pushed and pushed and they obviously came for a draw," centre-back Williams said.
"They made it very difficult for us but it's another point. We didn't lose the game.
"We wanted to get it done and dusted today. We haven't done that but by no means are we going to go away today disappointed.
"It's been a positive week, four points. We kick on."
Wales travel to Bosnia-Herzegovina on 10 October and then finish their qualifying campaign at home to Andorra - who have yet to even manage a draw in Group B - three days later.
