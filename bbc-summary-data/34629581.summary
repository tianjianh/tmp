Disorder broke out after demonstrators broke through a police line and entered the Eurostar terminal at about 18:00 BST, a Met spokesman said.
Smoke bombs and other items were thrown before protestors were "swiftly ejected" from the building, he said.
There have been no injuries or arrests, he added.
A post on the website of a group called Calais Migrant Solidarity suggest it had organised the protest in "solidarity with the Calais migrants".
British Transport Police, which is jointly policing the protest with the Met, said its officers were facilitating a peaceful protest when "a number of other individuals arrived at the station causing disorder, and missiles, including smoke bombs were thrown at police officers".
"This group were dispersed by police," it said.
South Eastern Railway advised passengers to allow extra time for their journey, as the incident may result in delays.
