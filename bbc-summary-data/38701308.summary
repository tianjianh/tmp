[SN]TITLE[SN]
Dunfermline Athletic 1-1 Dundee United

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Dunfermline Athletic and Dundee United each earned a point in a hard-fought encounter at East End Park.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Tony Andreu gave the visitors a first-half lead with a fine strike - his 12th goal of the season.
But the hosts responded before the break through John Herron's first goal for the club as the Pars extended their unbeaten run to 11 games.
United, who now trail Championship leaders Hibernian by eight points, are without a win in five matches.
The home side began the match brightly and should have taken the lead after just eight minutes.
Mark Durnan was dispossessed by Nicky Clark around 30 yards from goal and the Pars striker played in team-mate Michael Moffat rather than go it alone. Moffat's effort beat Cammy Bell but William Edjenguele got back to clear off the line.
Dundee United responded well and took the lead. The home defence failed to clear their lines properly and Andreu pounced to send a cracker of a shot from 22 yards beyond Sean Murdoch.
Blair Spittal then came within inches of doubling United's advantage, his shot from the edge of the box clipping the outside of the post.
And within minutes Dunfermline drew level after a sustained spell of pressure. Kallum Higginbotham did well to create space on the left and his cross was met by the head of Herron, who's run had gone unnoticed by the visiting defence.
Bell was injured as the ball was played in and although the United keeper recovered he failed to come out for the second half and was replaced by Luis Zwick. The former Rangers keeper was taken to hospital with jaw damage.
Higginbotham blasted over for the home side but United missed a glorious chance to take the lead with 15 minutes left.
Andreu was allowed a clear shot on goal from 10 yards but Murdoch pulled off a great save. The rebound fell back at the feet of the United striker, who despite having an open goal blasted high over the top.
Scott Fraser then had a free-kick from 25 yards out that looked destined for the top corner only for Murdoch to tip around the post.
Dunfermline Athletic manager Allan Johnston: "It went end to end and must have been quite exciting to watch and, to be realistic, a point was probably the right result.
"We started really well and the boys reacted very well and got back in the game after their goal.
"We had a poor start to the season, but you can see the quality in the team and we've doing well lately and we have to keep doing that.
"We have a lot of massive games coming up and we are looking good."
Dundee United manager Ray McKinnon: "I think the performance and attitude merited the three points - I don't think there was any doubting that.
"I was really pleased with the guys' performance and their will to win the game.
"Disappointed it is only one point, but I have to be pleased after a bit of dips in form and we were back to the best.
"The only thing that was missing was the finish and sometimes you don't get what you deserve."
