Colin Doyle: Bradford trigger Blackpool keeper's £1 release fee

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Bradford City are confident of signing Blackpool goalkeeper Colin Doyle after triggering his release clause of £1.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 31-year-old is club captain and was one of Blackpool's best performers in League One last season as the club suffered consecutive relegations.
Doyle will have a medical early next week and will join midfielder Nicky Law and defender Nathaniel Knight-Percival as summer recruits at Valley Parade.
Bradford ended 2015-16 in fifth and meet Port Vale at home on 6 August.
Doyle's release clause is thought to have been put in place to ensure the ex-Birmingham goalkeeper had options in the event Blackpool were relegated.
Should he complete the move, he looks likely to become the Bantams' number one after Ben Williams - who made 45 league appearances last season - joined Bury.
