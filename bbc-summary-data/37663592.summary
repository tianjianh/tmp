[SN]TITLE[SN]
Luton Town 1-1 Mansfield Town

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Luton midfielder Cameron McGeehan grabbed a late leveller as the Hatters salvaged a 1-1 draw against Mansfield.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Jordan Cook shoot over the crossbar for the hosts early on but Mansfield were ahead after nine minutes when Matt Green nodded in his eighth goal of the season on his return to the Stags starting line up.
Chris Clements' shot was saved by Christian Walton while at the other end Jack Marriott saw his effort blocked by a combination of Krystian Pearce and goalkeeper Scott Shearer.
Cook came close to an equaliser after 30 minutes, dancing into the box and just missing the bottom corner, while Malvin Benning's free-kick was easy work for Walton.
McGeehan sent one effort from long range well over, as after the break, Jake Gray saw his curler fly into the stands too.
Luton should have restored parity after 65 minutes when the ball dropped perfectly for Alan Sheehan eight yards out, but he shanked horribly over the top. However, the hosts were level after 77 minutes when McGeehan drilled home from 25 yards.
Hatters skipper Scott Cuthbert almost won it when his side-footer drew a flying stop from Shearer, while Marriott's left-footer was inches wide of the target in stoppage time.
