Demolished Maida Vale Carlton Tavern must be rebuilt 'brick by brick', inquiry rules

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Developers who knocked down a 1920s west London pub shortly before it was to be given listed status must rebuild it, an inquiry has ruled.

Westminster City Council told developer CTLX, which owns Carlton Tavern, it must rebuild the pub "brick by brick", after it was unexpectedly demolished.
CTLX had refused to do this and appealed the council's decision.
But a five-day inquiry by the Planning Inspectorate found in favour of the council.
Westminster councillor Robert Davis said he was looking forward to the Carlton Tavern being turned back into a "thriving community pub".
"This sends a clear message to developers across the country that they cannot ride roughshod over the views of local communities," he said.
The Carlton Tavern was demolished in April 2015, in breach of planning laws and in spite of the fact it was being considered for Grade II listing.
The council was given no prior warning of the demolition, which was not approved, and was done without proper health and safety procedures in place.
The Planning Inspector agreed that it was "highly likely that it would have been listed had it not been demolished", calling it a "rare public house", with "considerable importance for the community".
Historic England said they "intended to recommend the site for listing" because it was "remarkably well-preserved" from its interwar days.
Westminster council had rejected an application for redevelopment on the site in January of the same year, which was also upheld by the inspector.
