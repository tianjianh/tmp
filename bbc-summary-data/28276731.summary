A group smashed their way through the hotel's entrance and stole watches and jewellery before fleeing on waiting mopeds on Thursday, police said.
Brothers Reed Roberts, 23, and Skye Roberts, 19, both of Cubitt Street, are charged with robbery and possession with intent to supply a Class B drug.
They appeared at Wimbledon Magistrates' Court and were remanded in custody.
Two men, aged 66, and 27, and a woman aged 46, who were arrested in King's Cross on Thursday over the robbery, have been bailed, Scotland Yard said.
Police said they had recovered most of the items stolen in the raid.
The hotel was targeted in another smash-and-grab raid, on 10 June, in what police called a "well planned" robbery.
In that raid, a group of six people who had arrived on mopeds entered the hotel's boutique and smashed jewellery and watch cabinets before taking some items and fleeing.
