Hamilton Academical midfielder Gramoz Kurtaj has set himself the goal of being called up to the new Kosovo international squad this season.

Monday's 1-1 draw with Finland in World Cup qualifying Group I was their first competitive fixture.
They were granted membership of Uefa in May and Kurtaj has been in touch with national team staff.
"I'm on this letter of the players they can call," said the 25-year-old. "It's just up to me if I perform well."
Of Albanian descent, Kurtaj was born in Prestina, now the capital of Kosovo, just as the old Yugoslavia was beginning to break apart.
His early career was spent in Germany with Hertha Berlin, Neustrelitz and Carl Zeiss Jena and he arrived at New Douglas Park last summer after leaving Czech outfit Banik Most.
Kurtaj was a regular starter last season as Accies battled to avoid relegation from the Scottish Premiership.
His international prospects were hampered by an early season injury, but now he has made his first two appearances of this campaign, he is aiming to be part of a squad that has ignited the passions of his compatriots at home and abroad.
"I am definitely trying everything," he said. "I want to say that every Kosovarian is very proud of this performance in the first game.
"It was really nice to see the 90 minutes and I was really happy with the draw.
"People in the world can definitely look forward to this team."
Some players who are eligible to play for Kosovo but have previously represented other nations are still waiting to be given permission by world governing body Fifa to switch nationality.
"A lot of players are still waiting for clearances and they have a really strong team," said Kurtaj.
"For everybody, for my family, friends and every Kosovarian, it was emotional. People are really impressed with this Kosovarian team."
Accies lie sixth in the Premiership table after recording their first league win of the season in their last outing against Ross County.
While pleased with the club's business during the transfer window, player-manager Martin Canning is still in the market for a full-back.
Canning will monitor the free agents who are available but insists any new signing will need to be good enough to immediately challenge for a place in the starting line-up.
"We've recruited well again," Canning said. "At the start, we were slightly weaker in our starting XI, but the squad was stronger.
"Now our starting XI is as strong, if not stronger, than last season.
"If I could, I'd still look to bring in a full-back. We had two or three things happening in the last couple of weeks that haven't come off, which is sometimes the case.
"We're keeping an eye out to see if anyone's available and if they're the right person.
"At the moment, the two full-backs we've got, Grant Gillespie and Darren Lyon, are doing really well, so it's got to be someone who can come in and do us justice in terms of coming into the team."
