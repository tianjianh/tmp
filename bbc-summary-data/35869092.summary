Delay on beaver reintroduction decision 'risks welfare'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A wildlife group has warned the welfare of Scotland's beaver population is at risk due to delays to a decision on the official reintroduction of the animals.

The Royal Zoological Society of Scotland has written to the environment minister to raise "serious concerns".
It comes after BBC Scotland revealed beavers which were heavily pregnant or had recently given birth were among those shot on Tayside.
Dr Aileen McLeod is said to be taking time to "consider the issue carefully".
Scotland has two beaver populations, despite the species being hunted to extinction in the 16th Century.
An official trial re-introduction has been conducted at Knapdale Forest in Argyll. But beavers are also thriving in the Tay catchment.
Farmers and landowners have said the animals damage trees and cause flooding in fields alongside burns and rivers.
In January, BBC Scotland reported that beavers that were heavily pregnant or had recently given birth were among those shot by landowners in Tayside.
The animals can legally be shot but the news led to demands for restrictions on shooting during the breeding season and renewed calls for Scotland's beavers to receive legal protection.
Four years ago, ministers promised a decision on the matter by 2015.
Now Jeremy Peat, chairman of the RZSS board, has written to Dr McLeod expressing his "profound disappointment" at the delay.
The letter said: "As a partner in the Scottish Beaver Trial, the Society has (up until now) refrained from raising our objections publically on this issue, preferring to continue discussions with Scottish government behind the scenes to secure a positive future for the species in Scotland.
"However, having been given assurances that a decision was forthcoming in February - well in advance of the beaver breeding season, and some eight months after SNH's Beavers in Scotland report was published - it has become clear that our earlier approach was insufficient.
"It is with regret, therefore, that I am writing this open letter to you to raise serious concerns about the welfare of Scotland's beavers, specifically those in the Tay and Earn catchments."
In March 2012, then environment minister Stewart Stevenson said the fate of the Tayside beavers would be decided after the trial reintroduction in Argyll had been assessed.
Responding in January to the the news of the shootings in Tayside, a spokeswoman for Environment Minister Dr McLeod said: "The minister will be taking time to consider the issue carefully and listen to the views of stakeholders before making a decision on the future of beavers in Scotland."
