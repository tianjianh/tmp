[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Captain Jennings gave Wrexham the lead against the run of play with a looping header from Blaine Hudson's cross.
Dominic Vose had two chances to extend the lead while Joe Devera hit the post on his Boreham Wood debut.
James Russell kept the home side in the game, making crucial saves to deny Dominic Vose and substitute Mark Carrington.
The victory sees Gary Mills's side move up to third in the table and five points behind leaders Forest Green, who lost 4-1 at Macclesfield.
Wrexham manager Gary Mills told BBC Radio Wales: "I love the one nils, especially away from home. It should have been four or five. It could have come back to bite us.
"It's the league we're in - it's difficult. We lost on Tuesday and we've gone again here and picked up a result. It's important when you lose to bounce back.
"It's not easy when you have a disappointment like the other night because we shouldn't have lost the game and we've come here and put it right."
