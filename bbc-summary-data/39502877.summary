[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Leeds United defender Liam Cooper has been banned for six games for violent conduct.

Cooper, 25, admitted a Football Association charge for landing with his studs on Reading defender Reece Oxford in Saturday's defeat at the Madejski.
The ban was increased from three games to five after the FA claimed the standard punishment would be "clearly insufficient".
A further match was added for it being his second dismissal of the season.
The former Chesterfield man served the first game of the suspension in Tuesday's loss at Brentford, so will be able to return to action in Leeds' final league game of the season at Wigan on 7 May.
Cooper was an unused member of the Scotland squad for the friendly draw with Canada and the World Cup 2018 qualification win over Slovenia last month.
