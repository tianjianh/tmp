[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The chief executive of Birmingham City Council, Mark Rogers, has left the Â£180,000-a-year post.

The change at the top of what is among the largest local authorities in Europe was confirmed earlier by Leader of the Council John Clancy.
Mr Clancy said Mr Rogers's tenure was "during what has been the most difficult and challenging times".
Among issues faced by the council have been a budget overspend and failings in the protection of vulnerable children.
Mr Rogers joined the authority in 2014.
He said of his departure: "Birmingham City Council has been on a challenging journey of improvement and reform over the past three years and I am hugely proud of the team I have worked with to deliver much needed changes in culture, practice and performance.
"I leave the council in a much stronger position than when I joined it and, with the proposed budget and transformation plans set out for the next two years, now is a good time to pass on the baton."
In November 2016, a report said "flawed" planning and "unrealistic" proposals had left the authority facing a budget overspend of Â£49m.
The assessment came in an update to the government from the Independent Improvement Panel, set up in 2015 to help the council.
Also in November 2016, just over a fortnight later, a separate Ofsted report said the authority was still failing to do enough to protect vulnerable children, with its children's services deemed "inadequate"; a rating it had held since 2008.
The council, which then was part-way through a three-year improvement plan, said at the time it welcomed the report, adding plans to spin-off the children's services department as a voluntary trust were continuing.
Mr Clancy said: "I'd like to thank Mark for his hard work and commitment over the past three years during what has been the most difficult and challenging of times for Birmingham City Council.
"I wish Mark all the very best for the future."
