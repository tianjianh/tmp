Creators Ford Kiernan and Greg Hemphill said they decided to revive the TV show after the success of their shows at the SSE Hydro in Glasgow in 2014.
The TV show It will return to the BBC next week after a nine-year absence.
Their second stage show at the Hydro will run for 10 nights from Saturday 4 February. Tickets will go on sale on 7 October.
Filming for the new TV series took place at a purpose-built set at BBC Scotland's Dumbarton Studios and around Glasgow.
Still Game follows the antics of pensioners Jack Jarvis and Victor McDade and ran for six series between 2002 and 2007.
