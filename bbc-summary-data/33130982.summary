Majestic Wine reported a 22.5% drop in annual pre-tax profit to Â£18.4m, in a "challenging" year.

The specialist wine retailer said that the drop reflects charges related to its takeover of smaller online rival Naked Wines.
Sales rose 2.3% from the year before, to Â£284.5m.
Majestic Wine's chairman said: "Despite the challenging backdrop of a fiercely competitive environment we continued to grow market share".
The founder of Naked Wines, Rowan Gormley, took over as chief executive of the combined company in April. Majestic's previous chief executive, Steve Lewis, left the post in February.
Mr Gormley said in a statement: "Whilst my review of the business is ongoing it is obvious that we need to make investments to reinvigorate Majestic Wine. These investments will initially suppress profit in the short term but I am confident we can rebuild momentum in this excellent business."
The Â£70m deal combined Naked Wines' online and e-commerce skills and Majestic's national store network.
Majestic Wine appointed Anita Balchandani as a non-executive director earlier this month.
