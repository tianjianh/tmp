[SN]TITLE[SN]
Jack Adcock death: Doctor 'realised resuscitation mistake'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A manslaughter trial has heard of the moment a doctor mistakenly called off a resuscitation attempt on a six-year-old boy, who later died.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Hadiza Bawa-Garba wrongly thought Jack Adcock was under a "do not resuscitate" order, Nottingham Crown Court heard.
Giving evidence, a nurse said the doctor realised her mistake and resuscitation then continued.
Dr Hadiza Bawa-Garba and nurses Theresa Taylor and Isabel Amaro deny manslaughter by gross negligence.
Giving evidence via video link from Australia, nurse Katie Ramsden described how a crash team started to work on Jack after being alerted by his mother, who saw his lips turn blue.
"Part-way through, registrar Bawa-Garba said 'This patient is not for resuscitation, let mum into the room'," the nurse told the trial.
"The crash team started to back away and I shouted that this was not handed over to me. I was not informed that he was not for resuscitation - I did not know this.
"Mum was shouting and stressed, crying, asking if Jack was going to die.
"The doctor realised she had made a mistake and shouted to me for everything and the resuscitation continued."
Jack, who had Down's syndrome and a heart condition, was admitted to Leicester Royal Infirmary in 2011 with pneumonia.
He died from a cardiac arrest after sepsis was triggered by a bacterial infection.
Prosecutor Andrew Thomas QC previously told the court that Jack was "beyond the point of no return" at the point resuscitation was called off.
However, he said the "remarkable error" was "powerful evidence of Dr Bawa-Garba's performance that day".
The prosecution claims the doctor and two nurses failed to pick up the signs that his body had gone into septic shock.
The case is expected to last up to five weeks.
