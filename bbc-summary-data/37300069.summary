Fourteen-time major winner Tiger Woods hopes to return to action in October after more than a year out with injury.

The American has twice had back surgery since his last appearance, at the Wyndham Championship in August 2015.
The former world number one, now ranked 711, aims to play in the Safeway Open in California, starting on 13 October.
"My hope is to have my game ready to go," said the 40-year-old. "Whether I can play depends on my continued progress and recovery."
Woods suggested he will compete in the Turkish Airlines Open in November and the Hero World Challenge in the Bahamas in December.
Woods, who will be a non-playing vice-captain with the US Ryder Cup team at Hazeltine later this month, also plans to take part in the Tiger Woods Invitational on 10 and 11 October.
"It could be a fun fall," said Woods. "It was difficult missing tournaments that are important to me, but this time I was smart about my recovery and didn't rush it."
Woods had a back operation in March 2014, another in September 2015 and a follow-up procedure to relieve discomfort.
He missed the Masters in April 2016 for only the second time since his debut at Augusta in 1995 and then pulled out of the US Open in June a week before the event because he was not "physically ready".
World number one Jason Day: "It's great. I am looking forward to seeing him play again, seeing what the state of his game is, how his body holds up, how the mental side and the golf side hold up as well.
"I don't expect big things of him even though he is Tiger Woods. He has been out for a while but it is always tough to come back, even though you are the greatest of all time. It would be fun to play against him when he is at his best."
Eighteen-time major winner Jack Nicklaus tweeted: "It's great to see you back and in good health. You've done so much for the game and it's better with you playing. Good luck!"
World number three Rory McIlroy: "He brings an aura and an atmosphere that no-one else in golf can bring. I've missed that. Hopefully he can get out on the course and stay healthy for a prolonged period of time."
