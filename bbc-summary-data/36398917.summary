James Bolton: Gateshead sign FC Halifax Town full-back on a three-year deal

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Gateshead have signed defender James Bolton on a three-year deal after his stint with FC Halifax Town finished at the end of the season.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Full-back Bolton, 22, leaves the Shaymen less than a week after winning the FA Trophy at Wembley, and is reunited with former boss Neil Aspin.
The England C international call-up, who can play right or centre-back, spent two full seasons at the Shay.
"I think he is good enough to play in the Football League," Aspin said.
"Hopefully we can make that happen at Gateshead. He has all the right attributes. He is tall, he is mobile and he has room to develop further. And I feel he will do that."
