[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Bolton moved off the bottom of the Championship despite Matt Phillips' last-minute equaliser for Queens Park Rangers denying them all three points.

Trotters forward Zach Clough had the best chance of a tame first half as his ambitious overhead kick went just wide.
Wanderers started the second period brightly and were rewarded when Clough curled home an unstoppable strike.
However, deep in injury time Phillips' low strike squeezed past home keeper Ben Amos to steal a point for QPR.

The result means Bolton move up to 23rd place as a result of Charlton's defeat at Fulham, whilst QPR move up to 12th position.
It was an emotional afternoon at the Macron Stadium as Bolton, who were playing at home for the first time since the death of their chairman Phil Gartside, were visibly distraught with Phillips' last-minute leveller.
The visitors' dreadful form under Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink will be of real concern for Rangers fans, having now won just two of the Dutchman's 13 league games in charge.
Bolton manager Neil Lennon:
"It feels like a defeat, it's heart-breaking. We've managed to get a point out of the game but we needed three.
"The manner in which we conceded the late goal is disappointing. It was poor from us at a time when we should be seeing the danger out.
"There are plenty of games left and we all believe we can still get out of the position we are in. We don't look like a team languishing at the bottom of the league right now."
Queens Park Rangers manager Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink:
"They were a little bit more desperate as they needed the three points because of where they are.
"I feel like we didn't really create but neither did they it was that kind of game.
"It was not pretty, it was not a classic but just two teams trying to find their way who couldn't really find their way."
