Shane White's 68th-minute penalty in front of 1,450 fans saw City return to the Conference South after two seasons.
The club almost  in December 2012 before being taken over.
"We are the best team in the play-offs and sometimes you don't get what you deserve, but I'm delighted that we have," said manager Steve Tully.

After a shaky start where the club lost eight league games in the first three months of the season, he built what proved to be the strongest side in the division.
Since the start of November they have lost just four league games and ended the season in third place in the Southern Premier League.
"From the day we came in we said we wanted to organise, have a strong team, strong unit, and the way the club has bought into what we've wanted is a great thing," Tully told BBC Radio Cornwall.
"I'm delighted for the chairman, he's done a great job and we're really pleased that he's backed us whatever we've done.
"You can't have a greater chairman. I know I'm biased because he's the first chairman I've ever had, but whatever I've asked for he's always said 'yes' and you don't get many like that."
Chairman Peter Masters took over along with Philip Perryman after former owner Kevin Heaney was declared bankrupt and the club faced a winding-up petition.
"If it wasn't for the chairman there wouldn't be a Truro City Football Club, so for what he's done for the club, its great for the town and I'm delighted," Tully added.
