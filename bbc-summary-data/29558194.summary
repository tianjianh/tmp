Cheltenham: Terry Gornell set to exit as Eusebio Bancessi arrives

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Wolves forward Eusebio Bancessi has joined Cheltenham on a month-long loan, while striker Terry Gornell has asked to be placed on the transfer list.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Portuguese Bancessi, 19, signed for his parent club from Benfica in 2013 but has yet to play a first-team game.
He could feature against Shrewsbury in League Two on Saturday.
Gornell's request comes after he scored in Wednesday's 3-1 Johnstone's Paint Trophy defeat by Bristol City, his first goal in almost a year.
The club have confirmed they have received interest for the 24-year-old striker from another club but the player has rejected the move.
Manager Mark Yates told the club website: "Terry wants to go on the list, so we'll see what happens, but I don't have any problems with him.
"He is a great lad and no bother around the place, but I understand why he wants to go out and play because it's not quite happened for him here.
"At this moment in time, maybe it will take a change of scenery to spark something to maybe he can come back here and do well again."
