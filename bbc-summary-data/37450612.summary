A 25-year-old woman has taken over as the head of a local authority in the mainly Muslim north of Nigeria.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Hindatu Umar is the first woman and the youngest person to hold the position in Argungu city, in the north-western state of Kebbi. She is also the city's first unmarried local leader.
The BBC's Abdullahi Kaura in Nigeria says her appointment is unprecedented.
Some residents have complained, telling the BBC that Ms Umar "lacks experience and boldness".
She had been the deputy chairperson and was promoted when the tenure of the local chairman expired.
Our correspondent says that women in northern Nigeria usually remain in the background and rarely hold political office.
Argungu city is one of the biggest and oldest councils in northern Nigeria and is famous for its annual fishing festival.
