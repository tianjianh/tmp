Election 2015: Six ways views have changed in six weeks

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
It is the final day of the election campaign before the UK goes to the polls to vote for the next government. But how have people's views changed over the past six weeks?

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
At the beginning of the election campaign, between 27 and 29 March, the words most used to describe the campaign were "excited" and "interested".
In week six, between 30 April and 5 May, people were still "interested", but they were also "bored" and "confused" and felt the campaign had been "long".
First survey based on 768 adults aged 18-75. Second based on 1,085 responses.
In week one, the highest proportion of respondents (27%) thought Labour was having the most effective campaign, compared with week six, when 23% thought the Conservative Party was making the most impact.
The SNP had the biggest peak out of all the parties over the six-week period, after the seven-way party leaders' TV debate on 2 April, when 32% of respondents said it was having the best campaign.
UKIP, Labour and the Conservatives were most commonly cited as having the "worst week" over the six-week period.
First survey based on 1,500 adults aged 18-75. Second based on 1,085 responses.
Asked which leader had done the best overall in the campaign, 27% said the SNP's Nicola Sturgeon and 24% said the Conservative Party's David Cameron.
Asked which leader "surprised people the most", 27% said Ms Sturgeon and 14% said Labour's Ed Miliband.
Based on 1,085 responses between 30 April and 5 May.
By week six, 38% of respondents said the election campaign had encouraged them to vote for the party they already supported.
About a quarter (26%) of people said the campaign had had no impact on how they intended to vote, while 9% said the campaign had encouraged them to switch their vote from one party to another.
The election campaign had put 4% of respondents off voting for any party.
Based on 1,085 adults aged 18-75.
David Cameron was seen as the most capable prime minister in week one, with 38% of respondents saying they thought he would do the top job best.
