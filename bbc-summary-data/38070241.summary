Torness nuclear reactor shut down over seaweed concern

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A reactor at the Torness Nuclear Power Station in East Lothian has been shut down because of seaweed.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Reactor one was shut down just before 09:00 when the seaweed began to threaten a cooling water inlet at the power plant near Dunbar.
DF Energy said there was never any risk to safety at the facility but added the shut down was "unusual."
The reactor is not expected to resume production on Tuesday.
