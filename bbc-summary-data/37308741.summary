The 29ft-high (8.8m) frame - which was to have been used in the construction of a concrete wall at Goval - toppled over last week. No-one was injured in the incident.
Transport Scotland said it was working with the contractors to ensure health and safety standards were met.
The construction union UCATT said it was "deeply worrying".
A Transport Scotland spokesman said: ""We understand that an incident took place on site despite the contractor having robust health safety policies and procedures in place.
"We also understand that no-one was in the vicinity at the time of the incident. An investigation is currently underway and any lessons learned will be applied to future work."
A safety exercise that had been planned for a number of weeks will now take place from Friday until Monday, although some works will continue.
UCATT regional secretary Steve Dillon said he was "shocked" at the incident and added: "This is one of the UK's most high-profile construction sites."
