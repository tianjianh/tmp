X Factor and Britain's Got Talent to stay on ITV to at least 2019

The X Factor is to stay on ITV for at least the next three years, despite declining viewing figures and the arrival of The Voice to the channel.

The X Factor's 13th series began in August with 8.5 million viewers - four million fewer than 2010's launch show.
The Voice will move from the BBC to ITV next year, also on a three-year deal.
But the broadcaster has agreed a deal with Simon Cowell for both The X Factor and Britain's Got Talent to continue on ITV until at least 2019.
Cowell said: "I want to thank ITV for continuing to be fantastic partners. I'm delighted for the shows and, in particular, for all the talented people who work on them with us."
Cowell may not appear as a judge on both programmes, though - under the new deal he is only committed to judging one of the two series per year.
ITV is currently negotiating with Ant and Dec to remain as hosts of Britain's Got Talent for the next three years. Dermot O'Leary's current contract means he will keep presenting The X Factor until at least 2019.
ITV's director of television Kevin Lygo said Britain's Got Talent and The X Factor were both "big, brilliant, wonderful shows" that would form "an important part of our schedule" for the next three years.
"They are defining shows for us, ones that we are very proud to have as part of our entertainment slate, and they continue year after year, for months at a time, to be amongst the most popular and hugely entertaining formats on television," he said.
