Osvaldas Rimsa, 27, died at the scene of the collision on Rocky Hill at 13:45 GMT.
His Yamaha R1 motorcycle crashed with a black Alfa Romeo Giuliett, Kent Police said. The car driver, a man in his 50s, suffered minor injuries.
The West Kent Biker group paid tribute to Mr Rimsa on Facebook, saying he had a "real passion for motorcycling".
The group wrote: "It's with a very heavy heart that I tell you we sadly lost one of our own yesterday tragically.
"Osvaldas Rimsa had been with West Kent Biker right from the start and attended virtually every meet... the guy was dedicated and had a real passion for motorcycling.
"You will never be forgotten brother. Ride free mate and sleep tight."
Dean's Place Hotel in Alfriston, East Sussex, said Mr Rimsa worked for them as head waiter.
On Facebook, the hotel described him as "a young, intelligent and funny man with a very bright future ahead of him taken far too early."
Police urged witnesses to contact them.
Sgt Chris Wade said: "This collision happened at a very busy location in the town and I believe there may be other witnesses who have not yet come forward."
