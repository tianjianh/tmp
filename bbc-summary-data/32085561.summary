[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Birmingham City have signed Italian forward Diego Fabbrini from fellow Championship side Watford until the end of the season on an emergency loan.

Fabbrini, 24, played at Empoli, Palermo and Udinese, who transferred him to their sister club Watford as part of a major Italian influx in July 2013.
But he went back to Italy to join Siena for the second half of last season.
The adaptable utility player has just returned early from a 93-day loan with another Championship side Millwall.
That included an appearance at St Andrew's in February when he was part of Millwall's 1-0 win.
Watford have a recall option on Fabbrini, who can play in a variety of positions, including right winger, attacking midfielder or second striker.
The once-capped Italy international's only appearance for the national team came as a substitute in the  at the Wankdorf Stadium, in Bern, Switzerland, in August 2012.
Blues allowed another striker, Denny Johnstone, to go out on loan to Blues boss Gary Rowett's old club Burton Albion on Thursday.
