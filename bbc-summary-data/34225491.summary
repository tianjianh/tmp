Ironman Wales event organisers in Pembrokeshire say they are close to securing a new deal to keep the triathlon in Tenby.

Almost 1,800 athletes are taking part in the contest on Sunday, along with an estimated 10,000 spectators.
It is the last Ironman Wales to be held in Tenby under the current five-year term.
Pembrokeshire council said talks were being held to try to retain the event.
Ironman Wales and the Long Course Weekend - a separate three-day triathlon held in the county earlier in the summer - have grown in popularity and are now said to be worth millions to the local economy.
Concerns have been expressed about the safety of the cycling route after a collision between a cyclist and a van at the Long Course Weekend in July left the rider seriously injured.
But organisers Activity Wales Events said they were talking to the relevant authorities about the possibility of introducing traffic controls on parts of the route in 2016 and they may consider introducing road markings in the long term.
