Paul Drinkhall, Sam Walker and Liam Pitchford all beat higher-ranked players in Kuala Lumpur.
The win means England lie joint-third in Group B, alongside Germany but behind Sweden and leaders France.
England women maintained their 100% record in the Second Division with a 3-1 win over Canada.
Tin-Tin Ho and Kelly Sibley secured the victory, and England will play Serbia in a clash of the Group E joint leaders on Wednesday.
England's men, back in the top division in the world for the first time since 1997, finish the group stage against bottom-placed Malaysia on Wednesday.
A third-placed finish in the group would ensure qualification for the round of 16.
Drinkhall beat Bastian Steger 3-1, while Walker defeated Patrick Franziska. Pitchford lost to Ruwen Filus but saw off Steger 3-1.
