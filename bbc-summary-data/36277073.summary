Helicopter crash victim Iain Stuart funeral held

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The funeral of an Aberdeenshire oil worker who was among 13 people who died when a helicopter crashed in Norway has been held.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Iain Stuart, 41, of Laurencekirk, worked for the oil field services company Halliburton.
The father-of-two was on board the Airbus EC225LP Super Puma when it crashed near Bergen on 29 April.
Mr Stuart's funeral took place at Laurencekirk Parish Church before he was laid to rest.
The maker of the helicopter that crashed has lifted its recommendation that the same type of aircraft be grounded worldwide.
The aircraft will remain grounded in the UK, however, as a Civil Aviation Authority flight ban remains in force.
Super Pumas are responsible for many of the 140,000 helicopter passenger flights in the UK each year.
