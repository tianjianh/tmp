Tractor drivers who pulled cars from a field at Festival No.6 in north Wales are being offered free tickets to a new event, to say "thank you".

Hundreds of vehicles were stranded in mud at the park-and-ride site for the Portmeirion event in Gwynedd.
Organisers planning a singer-songwriter festival in neighbouring Conwy have said those who helped were "heroes".
Tansy Rogerson from the Gorjys Secrets event said she was stuck for two days in Porthmadog.
"It would be amazing if the farmer and his girlfriend that rescued me got in touch, as I never got the chance to get their names, and say thank you again," she said.
"We wanted to do something immediately to keep in people's mind what a great place north Wales is to see and enjoy live music - and to also say thank you to all those unsung heroes."
As well as offering free tickets to the tractor drivers, event organisers said those who survived the mud bath could get half-price entry to the new festival being held on Saturday, 17 September at Caer Rhun Hall, in the Conwy Valley.
It claims to be the first singer-songwriter festival held in the UK, with a line-up including the Mercury Prize nominated Seth Lakeman, world beat-box champion Bellatrix.
