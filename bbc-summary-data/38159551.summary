An MSP has suggested seconding doctors working in the armed forces to fill vacancies in rural GP practices.

Finlay Carson, who represents Galloway and West Dumfries, said practices in his constituency were in "crisis" with fears some could be forced to close.
Health Secretary Shona Robison told the Holyrood chamber she would be happy to meet him to discuss the idea.
Conservative MSP Mr Carson suggested the Galloway Community Hospital in Stranraer could be used for training.
In response to his questions, Ms Robison revealed only two out of six GP speciality training places in Dumfries and Galloway had been filled despite the posts being eligible for a Â£20,000 bursary.
The Scottish government advertised the extra positions in August amid growing concern about staffing shortages in general practice, with the financial incentive offered for trainees taking up posts in remote and rural areas.
Mr Carson said: "In Galloway and West Dumfries, rural GP practices are in crisis.
"GPs are working longer hours than ever, practices are being forced to merge, and there is a fear in local communities that some practices will close.
"Will the cabinet secretary meet with me to discuss the possibility of giving the Galloway Community Hospital in Stranraer training hospital status and explore the possibility of seconding armed forces doctors to ensure vital GP services can be delivered in rural areas?"
Ms Robison said she was happy to discuss any of the ideas.
"I'm always looking and happy to speak to members about ideas coming from across this chamber," she said.
"Obviously we would have to look at whether those ideas were practical and deliverable, but certainly I'm willing to meet with the member to discuss them further.
"What I would point out though is that we have a huge amount of work under way to improve the position within primary care, a Â£500m investment over the course of this parliament and some short-term measures to stabilise the position and address recruitment and retention issues, particularly in rural areas."
