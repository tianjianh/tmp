Why just porn? #NextBanIdea trends in India

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
India's Twitter users are making "helpful" suggestions to the government on what to ban next now that they have blocked free access to porn websites.

The government had asked ISPs (internet service providers) to restrict access to 857 porn sites in what it claimed was a move to prevent children from accessing them.
The decision sparked strong reactions on social media, with many criticising the decision.
But others have found humour in the situation, pointing authorities to things they can also ban for the good of the "moral fabric" of society.
Here's a list of things Indians want banned:
Candy Crush saga is extremely popular among Facebook users in India and around the world. But many often express annoyance with the constant requests for more lives, extra moves, and help to unlock new episodes in the game. This could explain why this seemed to be a popular suggestion for the #NextBanIdea.
This one, on behalf of long suffering Indian women - who often see their photos, links and posts peppered with requests of "Do you want friendship with me" - was a favourite on the list.
Hitting the early 20s in India comes with its own baggage - that of well meaning relatives constantly asking you "when will you settle down?", closely followed by "I know a nice boy/girl who you should meet". Ban them all.
WhatsApp may be the most popular messaging app in India, but it comes with its own set of problems. Like the annoying forwards that seem to have moved off email and onto WhatsApp, or the well meaning friend who keeps adding you to groups without checking with you first. Enough, says Twitter.
And finally, some people want India to ban the selfie, although given his love for the medium, Prime Minister Narendra Modi is unlikely to agree.
