You wanted to know if Coventry had as many historical buildings as Warwick before some were destroyed in the Blitz.
You asked us to find out which oatcake came first - Staffordshire's or those from further afield in Scotland and Yorkshire.
And you were curious as to who the man on the horse statue in Wolverhampton was. Here is how we got on with answering your questions.
David Fry, historian and author of The Coventry We Have Lost, said contrary to popular belief, not much medieval architecture was lost during the Blitz.
The plans to demolish and redevelop the city centre - known for its half-timbered houses and clusters of close-knit streets - were drawn up before World War One and began in the 1930s.
Much more of the city's heritage was lost in the post-war period of regeneration and "especially the construction of the ring road", he said.
But the city centre still boasts around 30 to 40 medieval buildings, many more than Warwick.
This BBC article says "there are in fact records as early as the 17th Century of the oatcake in Staffordshire".
So how far back do the others go?
The Welcome to Yorkshire website said their earliest oatcake reference was in the 18th Century.
However, before people in Staffordshire start celebrating, we have found two websites saying the creation of Scottish oatcakes date "as far back as the 14th Century".
So it appears the Scottish oatcakes came first.
The statue standing in Queen Square is called the Man on the 'Oss' by locals, but it is a sculpture of Queen Victoria's husband Prince Albert.
It was built in 1886 on Her Majesty's say-so and the unveiling of the statue was her first public outing since her husband's death.
Last November, there was a re-dedication to mark the 150th anniversary since the royal visit.
The History Website also has more information and puts some popular rumours to rest.
