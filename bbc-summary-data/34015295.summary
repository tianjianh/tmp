Children in care being re-homed due to financial pressures, NIHRC report says

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Some children in care are being re-homed three or more times a year due to financial pressures within health trusts, a Human Rights Commission report has found.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The report noted there are more than 2,800 "looked-after children" in Northern Ireland.
It said that in 2013-14, almost half of children who had been re-homed, had done so more than three times.
It referred to the "disruption" this caused.
The report found that in 2013-14, more than 35% of these who had moved, had changed accommodation once and 17.8% had moved twice.
Almost half of them had been moved three or more times, something which, it said, exposed children to "a level of intense disruption" and "a risk to their sense of security and stability".
These homes can include foster care with a family, a children's home or secure accommodation.
The chief commissioner, Les Allamby, said a fifth of children in care had been in the system for five to 10 years.
"Our research identifies ongoing difficulties with the current system and indicates that reforms are required in a number of areas," he said.
"Our aim is for improvements to be made without delay as it is essential that our laws and practices protect children's human rights at every step of their journey through the care system."
The NIHRC report also said there are more "looked after children" in Northern Ireland than at any time since the Children Order came into effect in 1995.
