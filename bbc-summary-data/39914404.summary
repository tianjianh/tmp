Kumar Sangakkara's unbeaten 124 helped Surrey secure a 66-run win over Hampshire on the DLS method to move third in the One-Day Cup South group.

The visitors collapsed to 89-7 before George Bailey (145 not out) and Kyle Abbott (56) shared a stand of 152, a List A record for the eighth wicket.
It helped Hampshire to reach 271-8 but the hosts made easy work of the chase.
Sangakkara hit his first hundred of the competition before rain halted Surrey's innings on 238-2 from 38 overs.
With both teams needing to win to keep alive their hopes of progressing to the knockout stages, Hampshire's decision to bat first looked a poor one as the Curran brothers - Sam and Tom - ran through the away side's top order.
Ben Foakes took a brilliant one-handed catch to have Rilee Rossouw caught behind off Tom Curran, before younger brother Sam dismissed Tom Alsop and James Vince (20).
West Indian bowler Ravi Rampaul then took 3-22 in seven overs, but Bailey remained calm and vigilant as his team-mates fell around him.
The 34-year-old former Australia one-day captain's record 152-run eighth-wicket stand was only ended when Rampaul - who finished with figures of 4-61 - bowled South African Abbott for 56.
Although Abbott dismissed Surrey opener Jason Roy for just one, the home side rarely looked troubled in their reply.
Sangakkara's 38th 50-over century of his career came off just 100 balls, with 12 fours and a six as he led his side to a dominant position before the rain began to fall.
Surrey still need to win their final group match, the day-nighter against Gloucestershire at Bristol on Wednesday, when Hampshire and Sussex meet at Southampton, also be vying for a third-place finish.
Surrey opener Mark Stoneman:
"We are very pleased to win, because it keeps us alive in the competition. But we were slightly disappointed to let them get that sort of total in the end.
"We should have kept them to 150-180 but George and Kyle batted very well so full credit to them.
"We got two partnerships going, myself with Sanga and then him and Rory Burns and that's the key to success in any cricket."
Hampshire batsman George Bailey:
"It was slow going for us at the start. The ball nibbled around a bit too. It was a bit of a grind. It's hard to get the balance right between trying to push on when you lose early wickets in a bid to get the 300 you think is par.
"Perhaps we played a few too many poor shots but Surrey also bowled very well early on. Kyle and I just wanted to see how far we could take it and by the end we were really enjoying ourselves and having a lot of fun.
"It was a half decent score but we still knew it was a bit under par. But, if we beat Sussex on Wednesday then we can still qualify, if Surrey lose their game."
