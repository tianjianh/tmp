Mr Trussler, 54, from Worthing, was killed alongside 10 other people when a vintage Hawker Hunter jet crashed on to traffic on the A27 on 22 August.
The father of six, who was a motorcycle enthusiast, went to watch the last flight of the Vulcan bomber which was due to take place that day.
His funeral was held at Worthing Crematorium.
The cortege included an escort of Mr Trussler's fellow motorcyclists.
His fiancÃ©e, Giovanna Chirico, said: "He was an amazing dad who had a passion for motorbikes and rugby.
"He would do anything for his kids and they couldn't have asked for a better dad."
Celebrant Terri Shanks said the service was a celebration of Mr Trussler's life.
"Mark lived life to the full with enthusiasm, with a smile and with so much love especially for his family, for Giovanna and his six beautiful children," she said.
"It's all of that we truly wanted to celebrate and to encapsulate his character."
The last of the thousands of floral tributes laid on the "Bridge of Flowers" following the disaster have now been removed by volunteers.
The toll bridge became a focal point for people wishing to commemorate those who died.
A few remaining fresh flowers have been placed at the entrance to the bridge along with photographs and messages in tribute to the victims.
Messages and cards left on the bridge are being preserved by West Sussex County Council archivists.
Discussions are continuing in the town about a permanent memorial.
