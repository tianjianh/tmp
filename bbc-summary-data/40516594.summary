There used to be golden eagles across parts of Britain, but they're now only found in Scotland.

Whitney's travelled to the isle of Mull, part of the Inner Hebrides on Scotland's west coast, to try to find the birds.
They're very difficult to spot, so she took two young bird watchers and bird expert Dave Sexton, from the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds, along to help.
After a few hours looking through the binoculars and a special telescope, they saw one!
Watch Whitney's report to see for yourself.
