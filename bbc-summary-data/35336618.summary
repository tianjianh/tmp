Health Minister Marcelo Castro said priority for testing would be given to pregnant women.
Brazil has the largest known outbreak of Zika, which has been linked to a sharp spike in birth defects.
Mr Castro also announced extra funds to speed up finding a vaccine for Zika.
He said that the goal was to develop a vaccine "in record time".
At the moment the only way to fight Zika is to clear standing water where mosquitoes breed.
The aim is that the tests will speed up diagnosis and ensure patients get correct medical treatment fast.
Since October around 3,530 babies have been born with microencephaly, which can lead to small heads and under-developed brains.
Fewer than 150 cases of microencephaly were seen in Brazil throughout 2014.
The US  State Department confirmed its first case of a baby born with brain damage because of infection by the Zika virus.
The baby was born in a hospital in Oahu, Hawaii.
The Hawaii State Department of Health said the mother was believed to have contracted Zika while living in Brazil in May 2015 and that the baby was most likely infected in the womb.
The US Center for Disease Control and Prevention issued an alert on Friday advising pregnant women to avoid travelling to Brazil and other Latin American and Caribbean countries where outbreaks of Zika have been registered.
The travel alert applies to Brazil, Colombia, El Salvador, French Guiana, Guatemala, Haiti, Honduras, Martinique, Mexico, Panama, Paraguay, Suriname, Venezuela and Puerto Rico.
Zika virus is transmitted by the Aedes species mosquito.
