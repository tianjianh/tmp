The 20-year-old was with Norwich and Ipswich at youth level before joining the Isthmian League Division One North side, where he played under Steve Ball, now assistant boss at Colchester.
Wyatt won three Player of the Year awards at the Essex side this season.
"He's an aggressive defender, good at going forward and very much the modern day full-back," said Ball.
