Four men have been questioned by a Spanish judge who is trying to establish what happened to a Scottish woman who died in Benidorm.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Kirsty Maxwell, from Livingston, West Lothian, fell from the 10th floor of a hotel in the Spanish resort in April.
The 27-year-old had recently been married and was in the resort with a group of friends on a hen party.
Four British men who were in the hotel room at the time were questioned as part of the inquiry.
They later left court without making any comment to the media.
The private hearing is part of efforts to establish events leading up to Mrs Maxwell's death at the Apartamentos Payma on 29 April.
Following Mrs Maxwell's death, another British man was arrested but later released by Spanish authorities.
He has insisted he played no part in Mrs Maxwell's death, reportedly claiming she entered their room at about 08:00 and appeared in a confused state before heading for the balcony.
There has been speculation she may have gone into the room by mistake while looking for her friends' room.
Her husband, Adam Maxwell, described her as his best friend and said he will never stop missing her.
Mrs Maxwell's family's lawyer, Luis Miguel Zumaquero said: "The men were called today to the court to clear all the contradictions in their stories and they did not.
"They had a great opportunity to prove their innocence today however they did not do that. We think this is a declaration of their guilt. "
