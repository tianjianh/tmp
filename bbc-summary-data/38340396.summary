Borders councillors advised to axe second home discount

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Councillors in the Borders are being advised to remove a council tax discount on second homes in the region.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
At present there are more than 1,000 properties in the region which qualify for the reduction of 10%.
A report to Scottish Borders Council said that removal of the discount could generate more than Â£100,000 in annual income for the authority.
Officials have advised that property owners be required to pay full council tax from April next year.
