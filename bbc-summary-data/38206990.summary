Her friend June Gable said the actress died from complications after a fall she sustained two months ago.
Drummond's other film credits include Doubt, which starred Amy Adams and Meryl Streep, and Awakenings, with Robert De Niro and Robin Williams.
She also played Ross and Monica's grandmother in an episode of Friends.
Drummond was born Alice Elizabeth Ruyter on 21 May 1928.
In 1950, she married Paul Drummond, with whom she moved to Manhattan. The couple divorced in 1976.
She became known as a theatre and television actress before landing her first feature film role in the 1970 comedy Where's Poppa?
Drummond went on to appear in films such as Synecdoche, New York and Ace Ventura: Pet Detective alongside Jim Carrey.
Her most recent film appearance was in the 2010 comedy Furry Vengeance, which starred Brendan Fraser and Brooke Shields.
But it was her appearance in the original Ghostbusters film, released in 1984, which she is likely to be best remembered for.
In the opening scene, Drummond is seen as a librarian who is terrified by a spook among the bookshelves before being questioned by Bill Murray's character.
