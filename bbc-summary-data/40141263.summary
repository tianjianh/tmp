[SN]TITLE[SN]
France 5-0 Paraguay

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Arsenal striker Olivier Giroud became the first player to score a hat-trick for France in 17 years as his side thrashed Paraguay in Rennes.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Giroud was on the scoresheet alongside Tottenham's Moussa Sissoko and Atletico Madrid striker Antoine Griezmann.
The previous France player to score three in a single match was David Trezeguet in 2000 against a Fifa XI.
France face Sweden in a World Cup qualifier next Friday, followed by a friendly at home to England on 13 June.
Giroud's first goal in the friendly was a volley from Ousmane Dembele's pass, his second a header with Dimitri Payet providing the assist, before completing his hat-trick on 69 minutes after a clever assist from Barcelona's full-back Lucas Digne.
Manager Didier Deschamps said: "Giroud is our best scorer, he continues to get goals and when he is not scoring himself he helps others around him score."
