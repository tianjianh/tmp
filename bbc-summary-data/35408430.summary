He spent the first half of the season on loan at Bournemouth but failed to make any Premier League appearances.
The 24-year-old had told BBC Sport that he was set to move to another Spanish club, Levante, but that deal didn't materialise.
"Spanish football will suit me," Atsu told BBC Sport during his discussions with Levante.
"A player should be able to play in any league but right now it's not what suits you or doesn't suit you it's where I will get time to play."
A statement on Chelsea's official website said that Atsu had agreed to "continue his development" with Primera Division side Malaga.
Chelsea bought Atsu in September 2013 from Porto but he is yet to make a competitive appearance for them.
He has had previous loan spells at Dutch club Vitesse Arnhem and last season at Everton.
