A UK charity has released pictures of a baby orangutan it rescued in West Borneo and nursed back to health.

The baby, named Gito by the team from International Animal Rescue, was so lifeless when found they thought he was dead.
He was being kept as a pet in the village of Merawa, about 100 miles from the charity's centre in Ketapang.
The team said Gito's mother had almost certainly been killed before he was stolen and sold for less than Â£20.
Kept in a urine-soaked cardboard box and fed entirely on condensed milk, he was severely dehydrated and malnourished.
He was suffering from a lack of hair and grey flaking skin due to sarcoptic mange, a highly contagious skin disease.
The charity's Alan Knight said forest fires devastating Indonesia were leaving wild orangutans without food or shelter.
"Those that escape being burnt alive are left exposed, under threat of starving or being killed or captured by humans.
"It's hard to stomach the shocking state Gito was in. He is in safe hands now but tragically there are many more like him in desperate need of our help," he said.
