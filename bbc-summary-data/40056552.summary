[SN]TITLE[SN]
Ex-police chief Stephen Curtis loses dismissal claim

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A former senior police officer has lost his claim for unfair dismissal.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Stephen Curtis, who was once acting assistant chief constable of North Wales Police, claimed he had no option but to resign as director of HR with the British Association for Shooting and Conservation in Rossett, Wrexham.
It came after he allegedly swore at and threatened a colleague.
He told a tribunal in Chester members of the organisation's council had been conspiring against him.
He said his trust and confidence in the association had been destroyed, which amounted to a breach of contract.
The tribunal heard in October 2014, Mr Curtis, a former UN police commissioner in Kosovo, clashed at a dinner in the Grosvenor Pulford Hotel with Alasdair Mitchell, the association's director for northern England.
He had been drinking and allegedly swore at Mr Mitchell and threatened to kill him.
He later apologised for his behaviour and received an informal reprimand from the chief executive, but resigned after a council investigation which found in his favour was considered "flawed" and a second investigation launched.
Mr Curtis drafted his resignation claiming bullying and breaches of protocol and was told he was being suspended.
Dismissing his appeal, Employment Judge Philip Davies said he accepted the evidence of the council members that they were not motivated or tainted by the opinions of others.
