However, the struggling hosts collapsed to 222 all out on day two in reply to title-chasing Yorkshire's 281.
Vince, who scored 212 runs in 11 Test innings during the summer, was caught at slip off Tim Bresnan for 60.
Sean Ervine (80) top-scored and Jack Brooks took 5-53, before Yorkshire reached 69-1 at stumps to lead by 128.
Earlier on day two, Gareth Berg had wrapped up Yorkshire's first innings to claim a career-best 6-56.
Vince, who has resumed his role as Hampshire captain for this match, and Ervine put on 107 during an enterprising fourth-wicket stand after the home side had slipped to 38-3.
Vince's 119 in the reverse Championship fixture against Yorkshire at Headingley in April was, prior to his 84-ball knock on Thursday, his only score above 50 in 20 previous first-class innings this season.
Ervine made two centuries in the draw against Somerset, but missed out on a third successive hundred as he edged Ryan Sidebottom (3-45) behind to wicketkeeper Andrew Hodd.
The Zimbabwean's departure sparked Hampshire's collapse as an inspired spell by Brooks and Sidebottom, who between them took six wickets for 23 runs either side of tea, earned a first-innings lead of 59.
Yorkshire lost opener Alex Lees before the close but Adam Lyth will start day three unbeaten on 37 alongside Gary Ballance, with the visitors looking to keep up the pressure on Division One leaders Middlesex.
