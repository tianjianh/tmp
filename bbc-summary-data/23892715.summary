Syria vote: Which Tory and Lib Dem MPs rebelled?

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The government's motion said the House of Commons "deplores" the use of chemical weapons by the Assad regime and "agrees that a strong humanitarian response is required from the international community and that this may, if necessary, require military action".

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
It said any such action would be "legal, proportionate and focused on saving lives by preventing and deterring further use of Syria's chemical weapons" - but the motion was defeated by 285 votes to 272.
