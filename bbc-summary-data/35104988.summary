Sagoo, 76, died on 5 December. He was one of the first presenters on commercial Asian station Radio XL.
A horse-drawn hearse featuring a "jazz funeral band" stopped at his former music shop and played an Elvis track, after leaving the Small Heath temple.
Crowds watched the procession pass by.

Sagoo died after suffering stomach cancer and leaves his wife Gurmit, three children, four grandsons and four granddaughters.
Mourners packed into the temple and gathered in front of an open coffin.
His daughter Rani Godfrey Sagoo said her father's motto had been: "Fulfil your passions but live your life in harmony with the world."
The musician and presenter's music collection, which dated from the 1930s, featured more than 50,000 tracks and Radio XL said he had been able to "showcase his wealth of musical knowledge" during three shows a week.
"He will be remembered for being the presenter with the husky voice, always impeccably dressed in suit and tie, and his loyalty to the station, as well as being a committed family man," a statement said.
"Sam Sagoo will remain an unforgettable name for Radio XL and likewise for all his friends and fans worldwide."
His love of music inspired his son Bally Sagoo, who has achieved worldwide recognition as a music producer.
Bally told his Facebook followers his father would "always be my hero and the person responsible for everything I am today but above all, he will always be the superstar in my world".
More than 800 people commented on this post, many sharing their memories and paying tribute.
Saminder Sagoo's daughter said the family were "a bit overwhelmed" by the response to her father's death.
"His legacy will be to live, to love and to be kind to everyone," she said.
Sagoo, who was born in India and grew up in Uganda, moved to Birmingham as a young man.
He went from working as a motorcycle engineer for manufacturing firm Birmingham Small Arms (BSA) company in the 1960s to running a music shop in Coventry Road, Small Heath.
Ms Godfrey Sagoo said: "He sold everything from Bollywood to Wham! and Frankie Goes to Hollywood."
He was also, she said, in "the first Asian boy band" who were called the Musafirs and released a single in 1968.
