Andy Murray: Britain's Davis Cup win needs celebrating

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
I had a split second to come to terms with winning the Davis Cup before I was mobbed by my team-mates.

One of the special things about this competition is you get to celebrate with your team-mates straight away, whereas after any other win you don't get to see them until maybe an hour after the match has finished.
On Sunday it was immediate, and I felt the full force of the team!
It's not the first time, it happened to me once at school after I scored a goal and everybody then jumped on top of me, so it brought back a few memories.
I actually get claustrophobic, so it was fine at the beginning when Leon got to me and then a couple of others but when there were a few more and I couldn't move, I started to panic and shouted to all of them "get off!"
The next couple of days will be much more fun than after my two Grand Slam wins, for sure.
I regret maybe not celebrating as much as I should have done after some of my other wins, because now I know how much effort goes into achieving them. You never know when the next one might come - it may never - so we should make the most it.
That's why we spent an hour and a half on court after the match taking selfies and chatting with the supporters. I don't really have many personal photos to be honest, but hopefully it made the day that bit more special for those who travelled over to Belgium.
It did take its toll on me a bit though - I could barely stand up at the end of it! By the time I got back to the locker room, I think everyone had enjoyed a few glasses of champagne but I jumped in an ice bath immediately. I'd started to stiffen up from not getting to cool down, stretch or go through my normal routine after matches. Standing around in wet clothes is not very good for you.
I do now make sure that I spend the time after wins like this with the people that I want to spend time with. Right now I want to spend my time with the rest of the team, and also my family and friends.
There are plenty of characters here and it will be great over the next day or two to enjoy some celebrations. I would imagine Dan Evans is the most experienced on our team in that respect.

To play and win a Davis Cup final with your brother is great, I'm really proud of him, and it may never happen again, so it's something else to savour.
What he was doing standing in my line of vision during Sunday's match though, I have no idea!
I just saw him standing in the entrance at the corner of the court at one point and found it more off-putting because it was my brother, rather than someone I don't know. I generally try to avoid eye contact with him altogether during matches.
Some players might find it beneficial to look over at their family but when they're right there, you see when they're stressed or nervous or pumped, and because you know them, you know what their expressions mean.
I'd just rather Jamie wasn't in my eye-line at that moment, so I let him know!
Winning the Davis Cup is a huge victory for everyone in the team, but from a personal point of view I don't see it so much like ticking off another big title from a list.
There are obviously still two Grand Slams I haven't won, and the Australian Open is a tournament I would love to win because I've been close there so often, reaching the final four times.
And had I got through the fifth set of my semi-final with Novak Djokovic, I would have had an opportunity to win the French Open, so I'm not that far off on the clay.
Hopefully I can use this Davis Cup win as a springboard for next year, to take on the attitude I had in every point and maybe get my first Aussie Open in January.
The Davis Cup has been amazing this year, and I would like to thank all those that have followed us.  It's been an amazing journey and we couldn't have done it without you. Now for some rest before I start training for the new season in a week or soâ€¦
