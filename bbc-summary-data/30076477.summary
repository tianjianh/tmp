Caterham have announced that they will retain Japanese driver Kamui Kobayashi for the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix.

The Oxfordshire-based team have missed the last two races due to financial problems, but will compete at the season-ending race thanks to a successful crowdfunding project.
"It will be nice to be back in the car," Kobayashi said. "This team is working hard and never gives up."
Caterham say they will announce their second driver "in due course".
Kobayashi, 28, has raced 14 times this season, but was dropped for the Belgian Grand Prix, and also criticised Caterham over repairs made to his car during the Russian Grand Prix weekend.
Finnbarr O'Connell, the team's administrator, said: "The team are delighted to have Kamui on board for the race weekend in Abu Dhabi."
Swede Marcus Ericsson, who has driven alongside Kobayashi for most of the season, terminated his Caterham contract with immediate effect earlier this week.
