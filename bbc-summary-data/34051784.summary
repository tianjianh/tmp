The victim has been named locally as Dolton Powell, 21, who was a former pupil at St Peter's High School in the city.
Police investigating his death said they believed a group of people from Bristol could help their inquiry.
The victim was found seriously injured at the All Nations Community Centre in Chase Lane, Gloucester, early on Sunday. He died later in hospital.
Two other men were also found with non life-threatening injuries.
Three men aged 22, 21 and 19 were arrested on suspicion of murder. The 19-year-old has now been released.
A tribute on the St Peter's High School website described Mr Powell as "an extremely popular, friendly, and very promising young man" who was "rarely seen without a smile on his face".
It added he was "very involved in the school community, and was notable for his responsible, polite, and caring manner" and that "he was friends with everyone".
Det Insp Steve Porter said police continue to question the two men being held in custody.
"Our officers are carrying out investigations throughout Gloucester, the wider county and into Bristol, as we believe a group of individuals from the Bristol area were in the vicinity at the time of the incident," Mr Porter added.
