[SN]TITLE[SN]
Port Vale 2-1 Shrewsbury Town

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Port Vale boosted their League One survival hopes as a goal and an assist from returning defender Ryan Taylor saw off fellow strugglers Shrewsbury Town.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Taylor, who re-signed on Friday after previously leaving Vale at the end of a short-term deal earlier this term, set up Sam Foley and scored one himself to earn Vale's second straight home win.
Louis Dodds netted a consolation for the visitors but there was no way back.
Vale remain in the drop zone but are now just two points below Shrewsbury.
The hosts, who still have two games in hand on their relegation rivals, scored twice in the space of three minutes as Foley headed in Taylor's corner before the former Newcastle man turned in Kiko's square ball.
Former Vale player Dodds' long-range strike was not enough to prevent the visitors losing for a third time in four away games.
