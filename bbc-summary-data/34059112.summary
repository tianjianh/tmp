Nearly 70 people have been rescued from floodwaters since the severe weather first lashed Sydney's southern suburbs on Monday.
More than 1400 calls for help were made to the State Emergency Service (SES).
An SES spokeswoman told the BBC most cases involved rescuing people who had driven through floodwaters.
"It's dangerous not only to members of the public but also to our volunteers," she said.
The worst hit region has been around the Illawarra and Shoalhaven on the New South Wales south coast.
A number of animals, including horses, cattle, and alpaca were also rescued.
"They were moved to higher ground by our large animal rescue technicians," the SES said.
Twenty-five people were evacuated on Tuesday around the Kiama region, about 120 km south of Sydney,  amid fears the walls of a small dam would collapse.
Authorities have now assessed the Jerrara Dam as safe and have told residents they can return to their homes.
