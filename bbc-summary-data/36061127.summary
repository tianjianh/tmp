Danny Johnson got his 12th goal of the season as he drilled home CJ Hamilton's cutback to put Gateshead in front.
Josh Gillies added a second soon after as he shot into the top corner, before Bromley pulled one back through substitute Adam Coombes.
But Gillies made the game safe after the break as he lobbed goalkeeper Alan Julian from a tight angle.
Gateshead move up to ninth place in the division, while Bromley stay in 13th position.
