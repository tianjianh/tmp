The Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) made the seizures between 7 September and 31 October as part of its ongoing initiative, Operation Torus.
The campaign runs twice a year and is targeted at street-level drug dealing.
Det Supt Andrea McMullan said it had been successful in recent years, adding these figures continued that trend.
"To have taken £1.35m worth of drugs off the streets is further evidence of our commitment to acting on information provided by communities to reduce the harm posed by dangerous and illegal drugs," she said.
Over the course of almost eight weeks, PSNI officers conducted 1,166 drug searches across Northern Ireland.
They made 532 arrests and charged 44 suspects with drugs offences.
Officers reported a further 74 people to the Public Prosecution Service (PPS).
The operation was launched in August 2012 and uses billboard adverting, posters and social media to enlist the public's help to catch drug dealers.
Ms McMullan thanked them for their assistance in providing police with information and said the drugs trade had a "devastating impact" on communities.
She added: "An interesting supplementary benefit has been that 181 motoring offences were detected during the course of the operation, keeping people safer on the roads as well as from drugs."
