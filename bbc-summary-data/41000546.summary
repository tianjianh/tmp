[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Castleford Tigers have signed Newcastle Knights centre Joe Wardle on a three-year contract.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 25-year-old joined the NRL side from Huddersfield in December 2016 and has made 15 appearances this year.
Wardle said: "I would just like to say thank you to Newcastle for working alongside me in what has been a hard time adjusting to life down under.
"Rugby careers are short so happiness is key and sometimes things don't work out, which is unfortunately the case."
