[SN]TITLE[SN]
Super League: St Helens 22-19 Wigan Warriors

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
St Helens fought back to beat rivals Wigan Warriors thanks to a dramatic late Mark Percival try.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Warriors led by two at the break thanks to tries from Tom Davies and Lewis Tierney, in between Ryan Morgan and Zeb Taia efforts for Saints.
Joe Burgess touched down to extend Wigan's lead before the hosts levelled through Percival's first score.
Tommy Leuluai's drop-goal looked like it would win it for Wigan but Percival went over with two minutes left.
Victory for Saints saw them record a second successive win under new coach Justin Holbrook and move to within one point of the Warriors.
It had looked like it would not be their night, firstly after Burgess went over from a George Williams grubber kick after the visitors had shown resolute defence to keep the home team out and then when Leuluai landed the first drop goal of his Warriors career to nudge Shaun Wane's side back in front.
However, Percival rose highest to grab Matt Smith's kick and go over in the corner and, after consultation with the video referee, the try was awarded.
