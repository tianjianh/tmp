[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Police are searching for a man who fell from the Clackmannanshire Bridge after police officers tried to stop his van.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Officers in an armed response vehicle spotted a blue Transit van that was being driven with three wheels on the Clackmannanshire Bridge.
When they signalled to the driver to stop, he crashed the van into a barrier on the bridge.
He then got out and climbed over the bridge's safety railings before entering the River Forth.
The man has not been seen since the incident, which happened at 02:50 on Friday. The bridge was closed while a search was carried out and did not reopen until just after 21:00.
Police Scotland said its officers had been responding to the "potential risk to public safety" caused by the van only having three wheels.
A statement released by the force said the officers had "attempted to alert the driver that they wished him to stop by turning their vehicle around and activating their blue lights".
The officers had then attempted to save the man from the water.
Ch Insp Irene Ralston said: "At this time the main focus of this operation is to trace the man, who has not been seen since he went into the water, which was at high tide. We are continuing to keep his family informed and supported.
"The incident happened as officers were in the very initial stages of attempting to make the driver aware of their presence and their concerns over the condition of his van. Anyone with information relevant to this incident is asked to contact police immediately.
"We are also keen to hear from other motorists who may have been on the roadway around the Clackmannanshire Bridge just before 02:50 on Friday morning and saw the blue Transit van.
"If you believe you can assist us then please come forward. In the meantime I would like to thank the public for their patience and co-operation while the bridge remains closed."
