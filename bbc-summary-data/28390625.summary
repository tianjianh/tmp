Police said the 20-year-old pedestrian was trapped underneath one of the taxis in Ormskirk Road in Wigan at about 00:45 BST.
She was freed by emergency service crews but died in hospital a few hours later, a spokesman for the Greater Manchester force said.
Police believe the woman was in the road after "an altercation" with a man when she was struck.
A 20-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of assault and remains in police custody for questioning.
Det Insp Paul Rollinson said: "We are trying to establish the circumstances leading up to the incident and are appealing for anyone who witnessed the collision or has any information about what happened before, to call us with any information."
