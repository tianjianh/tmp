Street angels, or pastors, will be spending their evenings over the festive period helping everyone from revellers to the vulnerable and homeless.
In Cumbria and Tyneside, more people are needed to join their teams as the winter takes its toll on recruits.
Anne Connelly, founder of the Redcar Beacons, started the charity one month ago and said she "cares very much" about the community and wanted to help those in need.
