Man to stand trial over explosives haul in Edinburgh flats

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man is to stand trial next year charged with having a large number of explosive substances at flats in Edinburgh.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Faris Al-Khori, 62, was arrested after searches in the city's Muirhouse and Leith areas earlier this year.
He faces a charge under the Explosive Substances Act which runs from December 2007 until April 2014.
Al-Khori appeared at the High Court in Glasgow on Tuesday and pleaded not guilty.
Chemicals listed in the charge include various types of acid, acetone and fuel tablets.
Al-Khori is also accused of a separate charge of culpable and reckless conduct.
It is claimed that with "utter disregard" for the safety of residents, he possessed a quantity of substances and rocket motors knowing they were either "explosive or flammable".
The charge alleges he exposed residents at the flats to the "risk of serious injury".
His QC Brian McConnachie entered not guilty pleas on his behalf.
Judge Lord Turnbull set a trial due to begin in April in Edinburgh.
