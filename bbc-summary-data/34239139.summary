[SN]TITLE[SN]
Unit to tackle 'unprecedented' number of children's home abuse reports

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A new unit could be set up to deal with an "unprecedented" number of reports of abuse at children's homes in Nottinghamshire.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Two police operations - called Daybreak and Xeres - are currently under way.
Nottinghamshire County Council now intends to establish a Historical Child Abuse Unit.
The unit would have six members of full-time staff and three part-time staff, at a cost of Â£614,000 for two years.
"The total number of allegations since Operations Daybreak and Xeres were established is unprecedented and requires a significant increase in capacity to ensure the council is providing adequate support," a council report states.
The establishment of the unit will be considered by councillors on 21 September.
Nottinghamshire Police launched Operation Daybreak in August 2010, and it concerns allegations relating to children's homes in Nottingham and southern Nottinghamshire.
Operation Xeres was launched in 2015 and concerns allegations relating to children's homes in central and northern Nottinghamshire.
The report states: "It is important to note that referrals relating to historical child abuse may continue and so a review is required to determine what resource is required beyond April 2017."
