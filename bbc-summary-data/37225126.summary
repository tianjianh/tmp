After the game Alan Kernaghan resigned as manager of the Glens.
Jamie Gardiner gave the hosts the lead in the first half, with Jordan Campbell adding a second in the 62nd minute.
Ciaran Caldwell pulled a goal back, Stephen Park restored the two-goal cushion and Nacho Novo netted what proved to be a consolation late on.
Annagh lie bottom of their league, having shipped 12 goals in three games.
Glentoran manager Kernaghan had gone into the game under a degree of pressure after a section of Glens supporters had voiced their discontent following a 4-1 league reverse at Coleraine on Saturday.
Gardiner completed a fine breakaway by chipping Elliott Morris for the opener in the 19th minute and the County Armagh side had their illustrious visitors in real trouble when Campbell added the second.
Caldwell's deflected 25-yard effort three minutes later gave the Glens hope, but that optimism proved short-lived when Park made it 3-1, Novo, Glentoran skipper for the evening, pulling one back from six yards out on 85 minutes.
"The first goal was important for us, it gave us a real lift, and hopefully this result will kick-start our season. We fear nobody," Annagh manager Paul Matchet told BBC Radio Ulster's Sportsound programme after the game.
Glens manager Kernaghan argued: "If we had taken the chances we created, we could have won the game by seven or eight. I am frustrated and I feel the fans' frustration."
Elsewhere, holders Cliftonville began their bid for a fifth straight success in the competition with a thumping 11-1 victory over 2011 winners Lisburn Distillery at Solitude.
David McDaid and Stephen Garrett both scored hat-tricks, with Chris Ramsey, Jaimie McGovern, Chris Curran, Jude Winchester and Gary Donnelly also getting their names on the scoresheet.
