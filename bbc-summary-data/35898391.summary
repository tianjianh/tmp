Kenny McLean is eager to follow up his Scotland debut with more caps after playing in the 1-0 win over Czech Republic.

The Aberdeen midfielder, 24, started in Prague and was withdrawn just before the hour mark as Gordon Strachan's side won their first match of 2016.
"When you get a taste, you always want more," McLean told BBC Scotland.
"I've enjoyed the few days. It's what everybody wants and I hope I can just stay here."
Ikechi Anya's early goal proved to be enough for Scotland in Prague.
"The boys dug in and we got the win, which was great," McLean said.

"First half was a bit tricky but second half, we were a lot better. We controlled the game in parts.
"It was obviously great to make my debut from the start.
"I felt good for the time I was on the pitch. I didn't feel out of place at all and it's where I want to be."
Strachan selected two squads for the matches against Czech Republic and Denmark, with the latter visiting Hampden on Tuesday.
Hibernian midfielder John McGinn - a former St Mirren team-mate of McLean's - is in the squad to face the Danes and could make his senior international debut in Glasgow.
"Hopefully he can do well enough and stay in," McLean said of 21-year-old McGinn. "You just need to enjoy moments like this - ones you need to cherish."
Alan Hutton, 31, won his 50th Scotland cap in Prague and the Aston Villa full-back described it as "a great honour".
"I never once really thought I'd get this many," he explained. "To get to 50 is a dream come true, really."
Ross McCormack, a late call-up to the squad, set up Anya's goal.
"To get a 1-0 win, we've got to be happy," the 29-year-old Fulham forward said.
"I just had to be strong with the two centre-halves and try and get them out the way.
"To be honest, I didn't see Ikechi, I just heard his shout so I thought if I can get it in that space, with his pace, if it's a foot race he's always going to win. When he got there, he thankfully tucked it in.
"Thankfully, the manager gave me a chance and I enjoyed it."
