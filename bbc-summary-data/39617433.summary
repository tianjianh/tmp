County Championship: Yorkshire wrap up innings victory over Warwickshire

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Yorkshire took just eight overs to wrap up victory over Warwickshire by an innings and 88 runs on the final morning at Edgbaston.

Warwickshire's Jeetan Patel was left on 49 not out when England spinner Adil Rashid (2-7) bowled Oliver Hannon-Dalby through his legs to seal the win.
Resuming on 85-9, Warwickshire's last-wicket pair managed to add 30 to the total, keeping Ben Coad at bay.
But the in-form paceman finished with 5-50 for final match figures of 10-102.
I watched him in the winter and he has really come on. At the moment it's fair to say he's the first name on the team sheet. This is good for the club when a youngster breaks through and there's now a healthy competition for places in that area.
The 23-year-old from Harrogate has now taken 18 wickets in two County Championship matches this summer and his efforts went a long way to enabling Yorkshire to wipe out the memory of last week's defeat by Hampshire.
Victory put the 2014 and 2015 champions third in the formative Division One table, with Warwickshire at the bottom having mustered only three points from back-to-back defeats.
After Patel survived a confident lbw appeal in Rashid's opening over, he at least gave them the consolation of reaching three figures with a lofted off-drive down the ground off Coad.
And the New Zealander, who has two first-class centuries to his credit, also lifted Rashid for six before the end finally came.
Warwickshire sport director Ashley Giles:
"The first two games have been really disappointing after such high hopes during the winter.
"We've done a lot of good preparation, but just not put it into practice. It's certainly hit the dressing room hard but all we can do is try to turn it around. After results like that you are always looking for a reaction and that's what we will look for (in next weekend's return game) against Surrey.
"A lot of these guys have done a lot for this club in the past and now we are asking them to go again. Surrey will be a tough challenge but we just need to play better cricket all round."
Yorkshire head coach Andrew Gale:
"It was a big week for us having played so well last week when we didn't get anything out of the game. We showed a lot of character.
"After last week's game we spoke a lot about wining key passages of play. In the third innings we let Hampshire back in the game, but in this game we got an opportunity to get ourselves in front and get away from them and we took it.
"If I was being ultra-critical I would have liked one of our top six to go on and get a hundred after they all got starts. But, on the whole, winning those key sessions was the difference."
