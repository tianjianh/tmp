Kate Robertson started a social media campaign to find a matching donor for Mike Brandon after doctors told him he needed a transplant within 60 days.
Miss Robertson, 31, said: "It's been an incredibly difficult time so the relief we're feeling is incredible."
Mr Brandon was diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia in March after experiencing fatigue and night sweats.
Blood cancer charity, the Anthony Nolan Trust said the campaign led to a 650% increase in the number of people joining the bone marrow register.
More than 7,000 people joined the register online between 4 and 12 May, compared to 939 during the same period last year.
The charity also said there had been a particular surge in donors from the Bristol area, with 4,120 people signing up.
The transplant operation will now go ahead.
"We know we have a rocky road ahead as a transplant is a serious procedure but knowing there is a good match for Mike is a fantastic boost that we desperately needed," added Miss Robertson.
"We are hugely grateful to the selfless person who has stepped forward to help Mike and to everyone who has pledged to do the same for someone else, by joining the Anthony Nolan register."
Miss Robertson's social media campaign #Shake4Mike asked people to send in photos of people shaking their heads to show they had joined the bone marrow register.
