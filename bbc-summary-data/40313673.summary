The 24-year-old arrives as a free agent after three-and-a-half-years at Sheffield United, having made his breakthrough at Livingston.
Scougall scored five goals in 29 appearances for the Blades last season.
"He fits the bill perfectly and has a lot of great qualities, bringing us that little bit extra in the final third," said Saints boss Tommy Wright.
"It's no secret that Stefan was a target for me. He's a player I've known for a long time and I watched him extensively when he was at Livingston and followed him when he went south.
"He has a real desire to play for this club and has nothing to prove to me or others but just wants to play and make a difference."
Scougall made his Livi debut in 2010, moving to Bramall Lane for an undisclosed fee in January 2014.
"My dad and I were invited to the Saints game against Hearts towards the end of last season and I spoke extensively with the manager that night and he was so positive about the club and his reasons for wanting me here that I was more than happy to sign," he told Saints website.
"I need to play football and once I knew that Tommy wanted me, it was just a case of trying to get the deal done."
