The Republic fielded a largely second string side in the 2-1 loss in Cork but Keane was still totally unimpressed.
"I wanted to kill some of them last night," he said.
"They should count their blessings they've managed to get on the flight - a reality check for one or two players who thought they were good players."
Republic manager Martin O'Neill named his 23-man Euro 2016 squad immediately after the defeat at Turner's Cross.
But speaking on Wednesday afternoon, Keane made clear his unhappiness at the commitment of the Irish players in Tuesday's game.
"If you lose it (the ball), run back - and run back like you care."
Aiden McGeady was among the Euro 2016-bound players who struggled to make an impression in Cork, with his lack of recent game time apparent.
McGeady moved on loan from Everton to Sheffield Wednesday in January but struggled to make an impression with the Championship club and was not required for last Saturday's play-off final against Hull City.
Keane said that he gave McGeady "credit" for seeking more action at Wednesday but admitted he was disappointed with the winger's display.
"He can do a lot better but maybe that's the story of Aiden's career," added Keane.
"Would Aiden find himself lucky to be on the flight? Well, he'll need to play better than he did last night to force his way into the starting XI."
The Republic assistant is optimistic James McCarthy will be fit for their Euro 2016 opener against Sweden on 13 June.
Everton midfielder McCarthy missed both warm-up games against the Netherlands and Belarus because of a thigh injury.
"I'd be confident James McCarthy will be OK for the Sweden game," said Keane.
Squad skipper Robbie Keane, 35, is also an injury doubt for the Sweden game but he is no longer a regular starter.
The LA Galaxy striker pulled up in training on Saturday with a calf muscle injury and missed Tuesday's game.

Keane did pay tribute to the players who missed out on Euro 2016 selection.
Millwall keeper David Forde was edged out by Sheffield Wednesday's Keiren Westwood for the third goalkeeping slot alongside Darren Randolph and 40-year-old Shay Given.
Bournemouth's Harry Arter missed out because of a thigh injury with his club-mate Eunan O'Kane, Ipswich striker David McGoldrick and Oxford United's Callum O'Dowda - who has stayed with the squad to train - also failing to make the cut.
"The guys that missed out took it like true professionals," said Keane. "They are disappointed because they have all played their part."
The Republic face Sweden in the Group E opener in Paris on 13 June with Belgium and Italy their other opponents.
