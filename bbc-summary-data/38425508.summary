"When I got the part of a princess in this goofy little science-fiction film, I thought: it'll be fun to do. I'm 19! Who doesn't want to have fun at 19?
"I'll go hang out with a bunch of robots for a few months and then return to my life and try to figure out what I want to do when I grow up.
"But then Star Wars, this goofy, little three-month hang-out with robots did something unexpected.
"It exploded across the firmament of pop culture, taking all of us along with it. It tricked me into becoming a star all on my own."
"Drugs made me feel normal. They contained me."
"I'm fine, but I'm bipolar. I'm on seven medications, and I take medication three times a day.
"This constantly puts me in touch with the illness I have. I'm never quite allowed to be free of that for a day. It's like being a diabetic."
"I enjoy taking jobs that make fun of me - or me as Princess Leia, or me as the writer, or whatever, as some idea.
"I have the ability, occasionally, of being able to step out and see who you think I could end up being. And I like to play with that."
"I always wrote. I wrote from when I was 12. That was therapeutic for me in those days. I wrote things to get them out of feeling them, and on to paper.
"So writing in a way saved me, kept me company. I did the traditional thing with falling in love with words, reading books and underlining lines I liked and words I didn't know. It was something I always did."
"Me being an actor was an accident, and not something I wanted to do, because I knew what happened eventually."
"You can't find true affection in Hollywood because everyone does the fake affection so well."
"He's not a big talker. You know, he wasn't Mr Chuckles."
"I was born into big celebrity. It could only diminish."
"I Googled myself recently and I  came across this posting: 'Whatever happened to Carrie Fisher? She used to be so hot. Now she looks like  Elton John.'
"Well this did hurt my feelings, partly because I knew what this person meant. Yes, it's all too true. I let myself go. And where did I go to? Where all fat, jowly, middle-aged women go to - refrigerators and restaurants."
