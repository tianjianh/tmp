Thick smoke has been billowing from the fire in Slitting Mill Road in Rugeley, Staffordshire, since the blaze began on 5 September.
The fire service said a controlled burn was taking place over fears water supplies could be contaminated.
It is not known how long it will take to put the fire out.

Resident Steve Povey said he and others were also concerned about "something toxic" in the air that could affect people's long-term health, including his pregnant daughter.
Alison Shaw, manager of the nearby Horns Inn, said the pub's takings were also down because of the blaze.
"Last week alone we have been down Â£3,000... we're very angry about it."
MP for Cannock Chase Amanda Milling also said it was "unacceptable" the fire was still burning.
The fire service said it was informed there was to be a two-hour controlled burn on the land on 5 September, but later received a 999 call to say it had got out of control.
Dermot Hogan, group manager of Staffordshire Fire Service, said he was aware of residents' frustrations.
Crews have been smothering part of the fire with soil, using foam to suppress the smoke and trying to remove burnt waste, he said.
The Environment Agency said there were fears the water run off could contaminate the local watercourse and potentially impact groundwater supplies.
Staffordshire County Council confirmed the land owner was instructed to remove rubbish from the site in June, and has since been served with enforcement notices.
