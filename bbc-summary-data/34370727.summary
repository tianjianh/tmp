Rugby World Cup: England made line-out error - Warren Gatland

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Wales coach Warren Gatland said England made a mistake by not going for a late penalty kick that could have drawn their Group A match at Twickenham.

Instead with three minutes left England captain Chris Robshaw opted for a five-metre line-out that Wales repelled to help seal a famous 28-25 win.
Wales now have one foot in the quarter-finals, while England will have to beat Australia to keep their hopes alive.
"I thought they would have gone for goal and taken the draw," Gatland said.
"It's a big call to make and a brave call to make.
"They'd caught us out in the past... throwing to the front of the line-out and we expected that, and did a good job in stopping that driven maul and pushed them into touch.
"Those are decisions you make sometimes and you go there and you get a driven line-out and you win the game and you're a hero, you make the wrong call and you're zero.
"There were two good sides out there. I have a lot of respect for England - their players and their management - and that game could have gone either way."
Dan Biggar kicked all seven of his penalties in an all-round performance that saw the Osprey named man of the match, and Gatland admitted the fly-half "kept us in the game".
Biggar held his nerve to clinch victory with a kick from almost on the halfway line, which comfortably cleared the crossbar despite the distance.
However, the victory came at a cost to Wales, with centre Scott Williams and full-back Liam Williams both taken off on a stretcher, while wing Hallam Amos was also forced off.
Wales were already without Leigh Halfpenny, Rhys Webb and Cory Allen because of injury.
"We lost another couple of players. Hallam Amos has dislocated his shoulder. We're running out of players in Wales," Gatland added.
"We have such a small pool of players and they worked so hard. I'm absolutely so proud of them.
"The pleasing thing for me was that we looked the stronger team in that last 10 or 15 minutes and that's testament to the hard work that has gone into this group of guys.
"The celebrations in the changing room were amazing."
Captain Sam Warburton praised his team for producing a result that he felt was one of the finest of his career.
"Wow what an unbelievable result. I think it was two very evenly-matched sides and I always knew there was never going to be more than seven points in this match, it was going to go to the wire," said the open-side flanker.
"Credit to England, they threw absolutely everything at us, they played really well and we had to be at our best in defence and gave a few too many penalties away.
"But I'm just lost for words, it was an amazing win.
"We've been in this position a few times at half-time. We might not be leading but we back the fitness work we did in the summer, knowing that in the last 20 minutes we can come through strong."
