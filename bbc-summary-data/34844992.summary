100 Women 2015: The Pakistani who has been cotton picking for 50 years

Maqsooda Mai has always been an early riser.  She gets up an hour before daybreak so she can feed her cattle and clean the house before going to work.

As soon as dawn breaks, Maqsooda grabs a huge cloth, wraps it around her waist and rushes to the fields to pick cotton.
Maqsooda has been working as a cotton picker for nearly 50 years.
Pakistan is the world's fourth biggest cotton producer and her home lies in Punjab's cotton belt.

Like the majority of the 500,000 women cotton pickers in Pakistan, Maqsooda started as a child.
Her sunburnt skin, bruised hands, and threadbare clothes tell the story of her extreme poverty and relentless labour.
"My husband is too old now, and my sons are not educated, they are always struggling to get work. No matter how little it is, my earnings are important," she says.
"If I stop doing this work, how will we eat?"
As we speak, Maqsooda's hands move quickly around the plant, plucking small bunches of cotton.
More cotton means more money so she does not want to waste a moment.
She also wants to avoid the scorching heat of the midday sun.
Cotton in Pakistan is still picked by hand and traditionally, it is women's work.
During the scorching summer days, on which temperatures reach 50C, hundreds of thousands of rural women work seven hours or more a day in the fields.
The cotton they pick will be processed to make new clothes which they cannot afford to buy.
It is a vital earner for Pakistan as its textile industry accounts for 57% of its exports. Since January 2014, Pakistan has benefitted from duty free access to European Union markets.
But it has made little difference on the ground where many cotton pickers earn less than $3 a day, even with a good crop.
And this year, the harvest is poor.
Maqsooda says she picked 30-35kg of cotton a day last year, but this year, she is only able to pick 20kg.
Muhammad Sanaullah owns the land in Balochanwala village in south Punjab where Maqsooda and a dozen other women work.
"They start picking at 6am (0600) in the morning and finish before 2pm (1400). The rate is fixed per kilogram - we weigh the picked cotton and pay the money accordingly," he said.
The payment of cotton pickers depends on the market rate for cotton which is fixed by the government every year. This year, the rate is around $0.07 per kilogram.
Mr Sanaullah agrees that the amount is too little for the labour involved but has his own argument to justify the low wages.
"The farmers would like to pay them more but they hardly save any money on the crop," he said.
"The government is not giving any incentive to the famers, it's only looking after the interests of industrialists."
"If we don't get a good price for our yield in the market, how can we raise the salaries of our workers?" he added.
But poor pay is not the only problem. The harsh conditions take a toll on women's health too.
"I have to sit down after every few minutes, drink some water and then start again," said Maqsooda. "My hands are bruised, my body hurts and my head aches all the time."
She has developed her own routine to cope with the strain.
"I shall have a cup of tea in the evening and a boiled egg, then it will be fine," she added.
The heavy use of pesticides, high temperatures and lack of proper protective clothing leave many cotton pickers exposed to serious diseases such as skin, lung and vaginal cancer.
But the young generation is hopeful it can escape this fate.
When Maqsooda and other cotton pickers finish their work in the fields, 18-year-old Rabia Mushtaq starts her shift.
Like the rest of the village women, Rabia's mother and sisters also pick cotton, and she has been helping them since childhood.
But Rabia knows that education is her only route out of the poverty and so far, she has managed to combine her studies with the backbreaking work.
"I don't like picking cotton but I don't have any other option," she said.
"I am doing this work so I can save money for my education. My parents cannot pay my fees."
"I want to do a Masters in English so I can get a good job and my mother can stay at home," she added
Maqsooda may not be able to break the vicious cycle of poverty in her lifetime, but with youth on her side, Rabia is hopeful that one day, her dreams will become a reality.
