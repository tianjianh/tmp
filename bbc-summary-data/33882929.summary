Based at the Dorset County Hospital, it will provide radiotherapy treatment to cancer patients in West Dorset who have previously had to travel to Poole.
Poole Hospital NHS Foundation Trust will fund the new centre, which is set to be be staffed and managed by staff from the Dorset Cancer Centre.
The scheme is a partnership between the Dorchester hospital and Poole Hospital.
Chief executive of Dorset County Hospital Patricia Miller said the new centre would benefit patients across the county.
Poole Hospital currently has four specialist radiotherapy machines, called linear accelerators or linacs, which a spokesman said were among the most used in England.
The Dorset County Hospital is now set to receive two new linacs of its own, one of which is a replacement for one in Poole.
Clinical director for oncology at the Dorchester hospital Dr Tamas Hickish said:  "Specialist radiotherapy treatment should be given to around half of those patients with cancer and its use is expanding.
"We are expanding capacity and implementing a solution which will bring huge benefits to cancer patients in Dorset, especially those in the west of the region."
Patients will be able to receive their radiotherapy treatment in Dorchester by the end of 2017.
