Jonas Blixt and Cameron Smith extended their lead to four shots with one round of the New Orleans Classic team event remaining at TPC Louisiana.

One ahead at the halfway stage, Smith, the Australian world number 112, and 252nd-ranked Blixt of Sweden carded a four-under 68 in the foursomes format.
The pair have yet to return a bogey and reached 19 under for the event.
Britain's Ian Poulter, playing with Australian Geoff Ogilvy, is nine shots off the lead in a share of 15th place.
Saturday's alternate shot format did not produce the sizzling scores seen in better ball fourballs on Friday when Blixt and Smith combined for a 62, but Blixt's 123-yard third shot at the last left Smith a tap-in for their fourth birdie of the day.
World number five Jordan Spieth, who carded rounds of 66 with fellow American Ryan Palmer on the first two days, dropped two shots in a third round 70.
Poulter and Ogilvy mixed four birdies and three bogeys for a 71, while Englishman Andrew "Beef" Johnston had a double bogey five at the 17th with American partner Kyle Reifers and shares 34th place at six under.
Storms are predicted for Sunday, when the format returns to fourballs, so earlier tee times have been arranged in an attempt to complete the tournament, the first official two-man team event on the PGA Tour for 36 years.
