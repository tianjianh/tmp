The pair, aged 25 and 32, were detained over the death of Jordan Thomas, 22, who was shot as he sat in a car at traffic lights in the city centre.
They are currently being questioned, South Yorkshire Police said.
The 27-year-old driver, who was seriously hurt in the shooting on Sunday in Derek Dooley Way, is in a stable condition in hospital.
Shots were fired at the victims as they sat in a silver Ford Mondeo, at about 22.15 GMT.
In a statement, Mr Thomas's family said:  "Jordan truly was full of life, with his cheeky grin and quick wit.  He was a charmer, anyone luckily enough to have met Jordan will attest to this and those that have met him truly did love him."
At a press conference earlier this week, Det Ch Insp Craig Robinson appealed for witnesses to the shooting to come forward.
"We believe the car was shot at from the passenger side, and then travelled down the Sheffield parkway after the incident, leaving at the first exit heading towards the markets, before pulling into a lay-by and contacting police," he said.
