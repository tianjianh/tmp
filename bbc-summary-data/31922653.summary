[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Developers who saw their plans for 1,000 homes near a Northamptonshire village rejected by councillors are set to appeal against the decision.

Bovis Homes wanted to build the new estate on land between Collingtree Park and Collingtree village to the south of Northampton.
The plans were rejected by Northampton Borough Council in January.
Now a report to the council's planning committee, meeting next week, says Bovis Home intends to appeal.
The plans, for the site to the north of the M1, also included community buildings, a site for a primary school and open space.
Council officers said in the report that if the appeal was successful it would be important to have in place an agreement with the developer for it to help fund play areas, footpath improvements and a school and community buildings.
The original plans were recommended for approval by council officers but rejected by the council after fears were raised about flooding in the area and some homes being sited too near the M1.
