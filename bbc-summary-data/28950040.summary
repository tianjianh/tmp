The Manxman clinched a thrilling victory by 1.8 seconds after a last-lap duel with Malachi Mitchell-Thomas, with Ireland's Shane Egan third.
Redmayne, who is home from a tour of Afghanistan, said he was "made up".
Douglas-based Dean Osborne took the B title, while Felpham's James Caswell-Cox won the C Race.
Redmayne added: "The pit crew did great - there is a lot of pressure and I want to thank them all."
The Newcomers race is broken into three different classifications with Newcomers A for machines up to 750cc; 650s twins and 250 two strokes are eligible for the Newcomers B Race; and Newcomers C is for 400s and 125cc bikes.
