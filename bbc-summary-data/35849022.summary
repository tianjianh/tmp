The 28-year-old Belgian escaped a ban after appearing to elbow Emre Can in the Europa League last-16 first leg.
He was then booked in the second leg for catching defender Dejan Lovren in the head with a swinging arm.
Former referee Howard Webb called him a "thug" for the incident, but Fellaini said: "I am not like that".
Ex-Everton midfielder Fellaini has been sent off twice since joining United in 2013 - one dismissal for a stamp on a Hull player.
He told Football Focus: "I don't want to elbow someone, I just defend myself. I am physical. I like to win my challenge. That's English football as well, but I am not a dirty player."
