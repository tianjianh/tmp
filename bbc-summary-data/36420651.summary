Randall, 26, played 12 times for Barnet last season after arriving from MK Dons, having previously played for Chesterfield, Rotherham and Burley.
"Mark is a very good signing for us," manager Warren Feeney said.
"I thought he played very well against us earlier in the season for Barnet and he has that ability to turn games."
Randall is Newport's second summer signing after the capture of defender Jamie Turley.
The Exiles released 13 players and offered eight new deals after finishing 90th out of 92 in the Football League last term.
