[SN]TITLE[SN]
Tranmere Rovers 2-0 Barrow

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Andy Cook marked his home debut with a goal against his former club as Tranmere secured a 2-0 win over Barrow in the National League.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Cook scored 24 league goals for the Cumbrians last season before moving to Prenton Park over the summer and he wasted little time opening his account for Rovers when he headed in a Steven Jennings corner in the 40th minute.
Tranmere could have taken the lead midway through the first half when Jay Harris did well to tee up James Norwood but the striker scuffed his volley.
Rovers sealed the points in the 86th minute when Norwood was brought down in the box by goalkeeper Joel Dixon and he stepped up to smash in the resulting penalty.
