Licia Ronzulli says she wanted to make a point about the difficulties women face in trying to juggle careers and child care.
MEPs were debating proposals to improve women's employment rights and opportunities.
One-month-old Vittoria appeared to sleep throughout the proceedings.
Mrs Ronzulli, an MEP for Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi's People of Freedom Party,  got a round of applause as she got up to speak.
She told fellow parliamentarians: "I would like to see more commitment on these issues from European institutions, to begin with the European Parliament so that we can all lead these two lives well."
