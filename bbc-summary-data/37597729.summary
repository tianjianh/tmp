The memory walk saw participants gather at Bents Park in South Shields on Saturday and travel 7km (4.3miles) along a coastal route.
The Alzheimer's Society said it was the biggest event of its kind it had staged in the north-east of England.
Organisers said the number of participants almost doubled that of last year's event.
About 35,000 people in the region have dementia, according to the charity.
