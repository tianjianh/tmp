The Lanarkshire fighter won lightweight gold at last summer's Commonwealth Games in Glasgow, and is unbeaten in five bouts since turning professional.
"That's kind of what we're looking at, but it's a long way away yet, and we just need to take it one fight at a time," Flynn told BBC Scotland.
"The pro game is a lot tougher than the amateurs; you need to be tough and resilient so it takes years to build."
Victory over Northern Ireland's Joe Fitzpatrick in the lightweight final at Glasgow 2014 thrust Flynn into the limelight, and his transition into the professional ranks has been smooth so far.
Tougher tests await down the line however, and Flynn stresses the importance of a gradual progression towards those bigger fights.
"We are not looking to rush everything. My manager knows how he wants to build me. I'm happy, I've got my trust in him and I know how we're doing it.
"We've got a solid foundation, and it's just a matter of time now.
Flynn's next fight is in Glasgow on 13 December against an as yet unnamed opponent. The bout will be six rounds, and the Scot's team will look to gradually increase the rounds over his next few fights before progressing to 12-round matches.
"I'm just focusing on learning about pro boxing, building up techniques, building up experience," said Flynn.
"Callum Smith just won his British title and that was after three years of [professional] boxing. That's when you're kind of looking at a British title.
"I'm only 22, I'm only a baby so we're going to build slowly and surely."
As well as catapulting him into the public eye, Flynn's gold medal success at Glasgow 2014 has given him belief that he can make his mark in the professional game.
"The gold tells you you've got something special," he added.
"It helps with everything. The gold helps you with your fan-base. It puts the public eye on you. It can add pressure on to you, but at the same time, you want to be in the public eye, you want to get your career up there.
"I've been saying from when I was wee, continually in the gym, 'I'm going to be champion of the world'.
"I believe that is what's going to happen. How long I don't know, but at the end of the day I know what I want. I'm not in here to be second best."
