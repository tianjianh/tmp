[SN]TITLE[SN]
MSPs to be sworn in for new Holyrood term

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
MSPs are to be sworn in for the fifth session of the Scottish Parliament.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
All 129 members will take either an oath or an affirmation in the well of the Holyrood chamber.
The leaders of Holyrood's five political parties will be sworn in first, before the remaining MSPs proceed in alphabetical order.
Once all the MSPs are sworn in, a presiding officer and deputies will be elected, with five contenders currently in the running for the top job.
The SNP is preparing for a return to government, having won 63 seats in the Scottish Parliament elections, two short of an overall majority once the non-partisan presiding officer is elected.
The Scottish Conservatives are expected to take up a new position in the chamber, having overtaken Labour to be the parliament's second-largest party, with 31 seats.
Outgoing Presiding Officer Tricia Marwick will oversee the oaths and affirmations in three 45-minute batches, with MSPs allowed to choose which of the two different statements they make.
The oath of allegiance has members "swear that I will be faithful and bear true allegiance to Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth," concluding with "so help me God".
Meanwhile the affirmation has members "solemnly, sincerely and truly declare and affirm that I will be faithful and bear true allegiance to Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth," omitting any religious reference.
Members then sign the Parliamentary Register.
In the afternoon, the newly sworn-in MSPs will elect one of their number to serve as the presiding officer. This role includes overseeing meetings of the parliament as well as undertaking diplomatic functions and representing the parliament at home and abroad.
Five MSPs have so far put themselves forward for the role, including former deputy presiding officers John Scott and Elaine Murray, leading Labour figures Johann Lamont and Ken Macintosh and Conservative Murdo Fraser.
