Andrew Logan Museum in Berriew marks 25 years

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
In the summer of 1991, the sleepy Powys village of Berriew seemed an unlikely place to open a museum to one of the world's most eccentric artists.

But this August bank holiday, sculptor Andrew Logan will celebrate a quarter of a century exhibiting his imaginative, flamboyant, and sometimes outright weird pieces.
Mr Logan claims the Andrew Logan Museum of Sculpture is the only museum in Europe dedicated to a living artist.
Influenced by his love of nature and travel, his works include a Cosmic Egg, The Living Taj Mahal and Egypt Revisited.
Born in Witney, Oxfordshire in 1945, Mr Logan qualified in architecture in the late 1960s, before finding fame as an artist amongst London's fashionable crowd; creating a sculpted rose garden for trendy boutique Biba.
His work has been exhibited as far afield as Los Angeles, Monterrey in Mexico, St Petersburg and Mumbai.
Amongst his fans and muses are Rocky Horror Show's Richard O'Brien and Patricia Quinn, along with musician Brian Eno, broadcaster Mavis Nicholson, actresses Rula Lenska and Amanda Barrie, and fashion designer Dame Zandra Rhodes, of whom Mr Logan has created a life-sized, moving sculpture.
But perhaps his biggest influence is the late American actor, singer and drag queen Divine, who inspired Mr Logan's Alternative Miss World pageants.
Last held in 2014 when it sold out Shakespeare's Globe Theatre, Mr Logan said the Alternative Miss World was: "Not about beauty - it's about transformation - and when it comes to costume absolutely anything goes.
"Contestants over the years have been famous and infamous, celebrated and unknown, a parade of freaks, fops, show offs and drag queens... anything can - and often does - happen."
The climax of the event is a "tear stained coronation", with Mr Logan's Crown Jewels made of broken mirrors; which are on display in the museum along with many of the contestants' costumes.
This weekend's birthday party has included music and art workshops, a street party and a treasure hunt, for which the prize was a silver sculpture created by Mr Logan.
"We had such a wonderful time at the museum opening that we thought it would be wonderful to do another one," he said.
"We'll be entertaining with surprise events and afternoon tea and a reopening
"It's wonderful to have had a joyous imprint on people's lives. Thanks to all those who have worked hard to make this possible."
