The 32-year-old joined the Shrimpers in the summer of 2016 and played 36 times as Phil Brown's side finished just outside the third-tier play-off places.
The former West Ham, Sunderland and QPR centre-back has made 357 career appearances to date.
"I had a fantastic time here last season," said Ferdinand, who was made Southend captain in October.
"As I've said before, when the gaffer asked me to sign over a year ago, it was because of him that I joined Southend.
"The feeling I got off of him was one of reassurance, one of confidence and a real football man. He showed that to me throughout the season so I was keen to get the deal done to work with him for another couple of years."
