Warnock criticised Richards' rehabilitation, saying players have returned faster from broken legs.
Richards returned to the Bluebirds starting XI for last weekend's FA Cup defeat to Fulham after a 15-week injury layoff.
Richards told BBC Wales Sport that there are "no hard feelings."
"I think that got portrayed in a way it shouldn't have", said Richards at an Football Association of Wales event to get more primary school pupils playing football.
"Obviously he wanted to come in and have me playing. I wasn't playing. He was expecting me to be back quicker than I was so he was frustrated.
"I think there was just frustration all round."
Richards joined Cardiff from Fulham last summer but hasn't played in the league since 27 September.
Warnock joined the club the following week and Richards has been impressed with the new management.
"I think the manager and coaching staff have done a good job. I know results haven't always gone our way. But there's new faces, they've changed the style of play - that's not going to work overnight. It takes time," he said.
"Come the end of January we want to be at least mid-table. It's important to start picking up points now."
Richards also says it's good for Wales that Chris Coleman didn't end up at Swansea.
"He's one of the best managers I've ever had. He played himself, he understands the lads," he said.
"It's great he wants to stay in Wales for now. He'd be hard to follow."
