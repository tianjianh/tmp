A fresh row broke out at the council on Tuesday night after unionist councillors said there was a "considerable financial shortfall" in the proposal.
Sinn Féin councillors accused unionist politicians of "blocking the project".
The new project would cost £2.8m.
The Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure (DCAL) said it was committed to funding £2.5m towards the project.
The remaining money needed to deliver the project totalled £339,000 and that had been approved by the regulator of the Landfill Community Fund but required council agreement.
Ulster Unionist councillor Daryll Wilson told BBC Radio Foyle that his party supported the project but would not agree to providing the "shortfall" unless it came from DCAL minister Carál Ní Chuilín.
Sinn Féin councillor Sean McGlinchey said unionist councillors had made a "sectarian decision".
The Sinn Féin minister Ms Ní Chuilín said she was "extremely disappointed".
A public meeting was held in Dungiven on Wednesday night. Ms Ní Chuilín did not attend.
Members of the public, sport enthusiasts and politicians voiced their anger.
Ryan O'Connor, a double amputee from Dungiven and keen sportsman, said: "I'm very angry.
"I thought everything was getting the all clear. I was ready to get involved with the new facilities.
"There's no hope at the moment. Councillors are supposed to be helping the people. It's ridiculous."
Paul McCloskey, a former British and European boxing champion, said: "It's an unbelievable shock.
"There's no real answers that make any sense as to why it's not going ahead at this stage. It's a disgrace."
One woman who lives in Dungiven said: "I'm very angry.
"Some of the councillors don't seem to care about Dungiven or what we get.
"They need to give our children what they deserve."
Sinn Fein MLA Cathal O hOisin said: "Councillors have a duty for the provision of sports services and facilities.
"If they are not fulfilling that duty then that needs to be addressed. In that case it needs addressed legally.
"We may have to look a judicial review. We will see in the coming weeks."
