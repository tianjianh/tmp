Eight crews are at the scene of the fire on Liberator Road but there are no reports of casualties.
One aircraft is inside the hangar and there are a number of shops and other hangars nearby.
A spokesman for Norwich Fire and Rescue Service said they were alerted shortly before 10:00 GMT. The cause is not thought to be suspicious.
More than 70 firefighters are trying to prevent the fire spreading to the aircraft.
The fire is currently spreading to the roof of the hangar which is used by KLM Engineering and Air Livery.
Emergency plans are in place to remove the aircraft from the hangar if necessary, but the task is complicated by scaffolding surrounding the building.
Greg Preston, the incident commander for the fire service, said: "It's very difficult access given the height of the building.
"It's going to be a protracted incident. As we strip away the roof we will be able to see the extent of the fire."
A spokesman for Norwich International Airport said the airport and services were not affected.
