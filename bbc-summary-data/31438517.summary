Why flying sometimes makes us go nuts

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
It's pretty well known that too much alcohol can lead to some nasty in-flight incidents.

But throwing a tantrum because your complimentary nuts aren't served right might seem a tad unreasonable to most.
Even if you virtually own the airline it's not a good idea as Heather Cho, the daughter of Korean Air's chairman, just found out.
She's been jailed for a year for throwing a wobbly when her macadamias were served in a bag not a bowl.
Cho - who was also an exec at the airline - demanded the flight turn back to the terminal and whacked the attendant who'd served the offending nuts with a book.
She treated the flight "as if it was her own private plane", said Judge Oh Sung-woo in Seoul.
"It's doubtful that the way the nuts were served was so wrong," he said before jailing her for breaking flying laws and assault.
It's not just nuts that can make people angry - although as Newsbeat's discovered access to food and drink does play a large part in displays of bad behaviour on board.
Requests for particular snacks, for more alcohol or even to take home unfinished booze, have all been seen in-flight.
Amy tweeted saying she saw another passenger requesting a meal for an invisible passenger in an empty seat just so her son could eat more.
@Blewyn admits: "I asked a stewardess to ask a guy to stop his nine-year-old girl singing. Seems harsh, but at the time I'd been working three days."
Bad behaviour obviously sucks for other passengers, but cabin crew get totally fed up too.
So much so that air crew from all over the world have started naming and shaming what can only be described as in-flight anti-social behaviour.
"Some of these people might be feeling anxious," says psychologist Dr Katharine Ayivor.
"You get a large random group of people in a confined space and it can lead to anxiety and they become demanding."
She also thinks flying is a time when passengers are often tired and they lose focus on what really matters.
"People have less control - they can't just walk to the shops for food for instance - and that's when small things get blown out of proportion," she explains.
"Maybe they feel hemmed in and they want to claw back some of that control."
According to flight crew taking off socks is one of the most offensive passenger habits as well as noisy children, hair hanging over the back of seats and eating smelly food.
One of the most ridiculous demands has to come from Martin Ward though who tells us he overheard a request for some fresh air.
