Fulham have appointed Slavisa Jokanovic as their new head coach.

The Championship side had been without a manager since sacking Kit Symons in early November.
Serb Jokanovic, 47, won promotion to the Premier League with Watford last season but left Vicarage Road after contract talks broke down.
He was appointed manager at Israeli side Maccabi Tel Aviv in June, leading them into the Champions League group stage for the first time.
His last game in charge was a 5-0 victory on Sunday, with Maccabi announcing Fulham had agreed to pay a Â£367,000 compensation fee.
Fulham chairman Shahid Khan said he had personally interviewed "many quality candidates for what we considered to be one of the best positions in football".
He added: "Slavisa's credentials and passion for the job rose to the top through every stage of this process, and we cannot wait to welcome him to Motspur Park and Craven Cottage."
Jokanovic, who spent two years as a player with Chelsea between 2000 and 2002, arrives at Fulham with the Londoners 18th in the Championship.
Their next match is on Tuesday, at home to fellow strugglers Rotherham, who are 21st.
