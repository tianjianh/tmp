[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The victims were between 14 and 18 years old, police said. Six were burned to death.
Police used tear gas to control the riot in Caruaru, in Pernambuco state. Part of the building was set on fire by the inmates.
There are 205 inmates currently in the prison, which has capacity for only up to 90, reports say.
Police say they are still investigating the causes of the riot, but local media reported that the incident was sparked by clashes between rival gangs.
Many Brazilian prisons are poorly resourced and overcrowded and riots are frequent.
