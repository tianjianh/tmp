So Mi Dar: John Gosden-trained filly to miss Oaks at Epsom

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Second favourite So Mi Dar will miss next month's Oaks at Epsom as she is lame, says trainer John Gosden.

The impressive winner of the Musidora Stakes at York, owned by Lord Lloyd Webber, was 9-4 for the Classic on 3 June.
Minding, trained by Aidan O'Brien, is now the 1-2 favourite for the Oaks.
"It's a bit of a bombshell I'm afraid but the horse comes first. We have to do what is right by the filly," said Gosden.
"She may well come right in 10 days but at this stage you cannot go to any major race. She is not right."
The four-length York win, under Frankie Dettori, was a third career triumph for unbeaten Epsom Derby Trial winner So Mi Dar, whose dam Dar Re Mi won three Group One races.
BBC horse racing correspondent Cornelius Lysaght:
What a pity, but this probably isn't serious and actually John Gosden thinks it's even possible she could be right as rain again before the Oaks. However, a) he can't be sure, b) he certainly doesn't want to rush a filly of this quality, and c) he wouldn't be keen to send her on such an important assignment having had such a setback, and anyway all kinds of glittering prizes, notably the Irish Oaks on 16 July, lie ahead.
As for Epsom's fillies-only Classic, staged on the Derby course but the day before, it is now hard to look beyond the brilliant 1000 Guineas winner Minding, though her stamina over the mile-and-a-half distance isn't guaranteed.
