Labadie started his career with West Bromwich Albion and has also played for Tranmere Rovers and Notts County.
In two seasons the 25-year-old made 52 league appearances for the Daggers, who were relegated from the Football League in the 2015-16 season.
"I know there were not three or four but five or six clubs queuing for his signature," boss Warren Feeney said.
Feeney continued, "He's an athlete, he can play and score goals but a.so he's not one who shies away from anything.
"I just told him that we're never going to compete with the big hitters in the league but I want a squad of people who want to play for this club and enjoy what we're trying to do.
"I'm absolutely delighted I've got him."
Croydon-born Labadie is Newport's fourth signing of the summer and he believes he has joined a club capable of challenging for promotion following a difficult 2015-16 season.
"After speaking to him for about 10 minutes I knew I wanted to be playing my football at Newport County," Labadie said.
"I had a few other offers but once I spoke to Warren I knew this was the place for me.
The league's really competitive and really tight but the recruitment that he's done so far as everyone can see has been bang on.
"The players he's brought in and is aiming to bring in, I've got no doubts we'll be up there at the other end of the table.
"That's what I'm aiming for, that's what the manager is aiming for, I don't see why we can't do that."
