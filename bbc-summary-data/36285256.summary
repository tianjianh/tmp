Terence Smith, who was Goole's deputy mayor, was voted in for a 12-month term at the council's annual meeting on Thursday.
Mr Smith, who was elected as a councillor in the East Yorkshire town in 2015, said: "I feel like I'm giving my bit back to the community."
Goole Town Council oversees a population of about 18,500 as part of the East Riding of Yorkshire Council.
The town council provides additional local services.
Mr Smith said: "When the A-level results came out last year, my friends were out partying. I was in a council meeting."
Councillor Keith Moore said: "It feels extremely pleasant to bring fresh views into the council chamber.
"He's really grabbed the bull by the horns and has performed excellently in his ward."
Mr Smith represents Goole North East.
Tony Smith, his father said: "I'm very proud of him. Next stop Number 10!"
The youngest MP in the UK is Mhairi Black of the SNP, who was 20 when she made her maiden speech in the House of Commons in July 2015.
Tom Watson MP, Labour's deputy leader, tweeted: "Well done to my pal @TerenceSmith14 - the youngest mayor in the world (probably)."
