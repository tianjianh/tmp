Police have found a sheep in a block of flats in Dublin city centre.

The ewe was discovered in Oliver Bond flats on Wednesday night, when a police patrol saw children chasing the animal.
Officers put the sheep into a patrol car, took it to a police station and called the Dublin Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals [DSPCA].
A spokeswoman said it was the fourth sheep they have had to pick up from the city centre over the last 18 months.
On their official Twitter account, An Garda Síochána (Irish police) tweeted a photo of the sheep and wrote: "Woolly story!  Sheep found in Oliver Bond flats last night! Now safe at Kevin St Garda station. DSPA on the way."
The flat complex, in the south inner city, is named after the 18th Century Irish revolutionary Oliver Bond, who made his living as a merchant in the woollen trade.
The ewe was said to be in good health and has been transferred from the station to DSPCA facility in Rathfarnham, south Dublin, where she has been given a new name.
DSPCA spokeswoman Gillian Bird told the BBC: "She is from the Oliver Bond Flats so we have named her Special Agent Olivia Bond, Licensed to lamb."
She added that it was illegal to keep a farm animal without a licence and although there are some city centre farms in Dublin, a flat complex was not an appropriate setting to keep a sheep.
Ms Bird said it was "not unusual" for farm animals to be stolen and brought into the city, and that some thieves did it "for fun".
She said they recently rescued a nanny goat from the south Dublin suburb of Tallaght, after a member of the public called them to report that children were "kicking it around the street".
The goat had recently given birth to two kids, and the DSPCA managed to reunite the animal with its owner and its offspring.
The DSPCA now intends to launch an appeal to find the owner of the sheep.
