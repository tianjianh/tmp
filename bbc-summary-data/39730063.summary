In the latest attack, the Saab was left at the scene and seven or eight masked males, drove off in a white Volkswagen Golf and a white Ford Focus C-max, said the force.
These vehicles were stolen and bearing false number plates and were found abandoned in east Leeds. They are being forensically examined.
It is not yet clear if the raids are linked, police say.
Louis Vuitton sells luxury handbags, some of which can retail for more than Â£3,000.
The fashion house, which started making luggage in 1859, has about 15 stores in the UK.
