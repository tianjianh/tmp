The event saw 7,500 runners make their way along the 5km route which started and finished in George Square, the venue for Glasgow's festive market.
This year - the event's 10th anniversary - participants were raising money for the Beatson Cancer Charity.
The Santa Dash has raised more than Â£100,000 for various charities working in and around Glasgow since 2006.
Beatson Cancer Charity's mascot Bella and Kingsley, mascot for Partick Thistle football club were among those taking part.
Joyce Ross, corporate partnerships manager at Beatson Cancer Charity, said: "We are overwhelmed with the incredible support from everyone who contributed to the success of this year's Santa Dash.
"The event wouldn't be as special without the valuable support from volunteers, fundraisers, sponsors and, of course, the 7,500 Santa Dashers. Thank you to each and every one of you!
"All funds raised from the event will provide vital specialist staff posts including nursing, radiography, physics and research based staff as well as funding enhanced medical equipment, innovative service developments, research projects and educational initiatives to support the 8,000 new patients and their families who attend the Beatson and its related facilities each year."
