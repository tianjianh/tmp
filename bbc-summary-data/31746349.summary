The 35-year-old has agreed an initial 10-match contract and will be available for their opening T20 game against Derbyshire at Grace Road on 22 May.
He will join Australian pace bowler Clint McKay in the squad.
"Leicestershire will have a new look for 2015 and I'm ready to play my part," Elliott said.
"I'm really excited to be a Fox this season and make some valuable contributions with both bat and ball."
Although born in South Africa, Elliott has played five Tests and three T20 matches for New Zealand.
But his main involvement in international cricket has been in the 50-over format, with 62 caps so far, and he is currently playing for the Kiwis at the World Cup.
"His experience will be invaluable to us in the new era for Leicestershire County Cricket Club," chief executive Wasim Khan told the club website.
"Grant is a fine middle order batsman and also offers us good options with the ball and in the field."
Elliott could play more than the stipulated 10 matches, depending on whether he is picked for New Zealand's tour to England at the start of the summer.
