Porte Ouverte, or Open Door, has been used by many Twitter users in Nice offering their homes to those needing somewhere to shelter.
Users encouraged each other not to share their addresses online, but to privately send them through direct messages.
This post used the hashtag #Nice06, a reference to the postcode of the district where the tragedy occurred, which has also been trending on social media.
According to Twitter users, taxi drivers were also offering free rides to those in the area.
Thousands have also posted under the hashtag #RechercheNice, or "search Nice", in the hope of finding their friends and loved ones.
Pictures of those missing have flooded social media, with brief descriptions of each individual. An account called @NiceFindPeople was quickly set up, which circulated a note bearing the names of all those reported lost. It has since been retweeted almost 500 times.
A story from a Facebook user named Tiava Banner who lost her baby has also been widely shared.
"We've lost our 8-month-old baby. Friends in Nice, if you've seen him, if you were there, if you've picked him up please contact me," said Tiava on Facebook.
The post was later updated to say the baby had been found, and thanked a woman named Joy Ruez.
"Thank you Facebook to all those who helped and sent messages of support," Tiava Banner wrote, also adding hashtags associated with the Nice attacks.
The BBC has not been able to independently verify this story, but its spread shows perhaps how much people want to hear of a happy ending in the midst of the tragedy.
The #JeSuis hashtag first emerged during France's Charlie Hebdo attacks, and has since been used routinely to show solidarity with terror victims around the world.
As news of the attacks spread, #JeSuisNice quickly emerged online. However, many have taken to twitter to express their cynicism.
#PrayForNice also quickly made the rounds on Twitter, with many expressing their sentiment and disgust at the attacks.
Here are some of the celebrities and political figures who used the hashtag to extend their thoughts and sympathy.
Facebook quickly activated its safety check feature, which automatically sent users in the affected area a message to ask if they were safe.
The feature acts as a way of letting friends and family know if the user is alright.
France had been on high alert following last November's attacks in Paris in which 130 people died and hundreds were wounded.
The state of emergency had been due to end on 26 July but will now be extended.
