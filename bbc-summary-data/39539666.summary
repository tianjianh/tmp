Morton 1-1 Hibs: Neil Lennon angry at ref over handball decision

Hibernian boss Neil Lennon says the officials cost his side three points in their 1-1 draw at Morton.

Lennon was left angry by referee Bobby Madden's decision not to award a penalty when a John McGinn shot appeared to strike Mark Russell's hand.
"We got done by a referee," Lennon told BBC Scotland.
"Russell puts two hands on the ball - it was as clear as day and the only people who didn't see it, or decide not to give a penalty, are the officials."
The incident happened when Championship-leaders Hibs were a Jason Cummings goal to the good against Ton.
And Lennon was furious given the fact Hibs conceded a penalty against Dunfermline in similar circumstances last week.
"I need to know what the handball rule is," he added. "The ref said he felt he couldn't give it because it was hit hard at him.
"I am lost for words. I hate going on about officials but I'm unhappy with Bobby's performance today, I thought he was very much pro-Morton in a lot of decisions and certainly that's a big moment in the game as we could have been going in 2-0."
This is not the first time this season that Hibs have been unhappy with officials' decisions, the Easter Road outfit having had three red cards overturned on appeal.
Lennon added: "It's embarrassing that we have had five red cards, by the way not one bad tackle, and three have been rescinded."
Morton earned a point thanks to a Lawrence Shankland penalty after Jamie McDonagh was brought down by Darren McGregor.
Hibs remain nine points clear of nearest challengers Falkirk and could secure the Championship title next week if results elsewhere go their way, but Lennon insists the matter should already be settled.
"We're not ruthless enough," he said. "We have Jason Cummings, who is a superstar, and the rest aren't ruthless enough in front of goal.
"We've had 13 draws now - 10 of them we should have won - but our inability to put the ball in the net or get across people and head balls in the net is the reason why we're not promoted just yet."
Lennon and Morton counterpart Jim Duffy, who were involved in a pitch-side altercation when the sides last met, were on far friendlier terms ahead of this one.
And Duffy was pleased to earn a point against the league-leaders.
"Hibs were better in the first half, I don't think there's any doubt about that," he said. "They imposed themselves on the game and got to the second balls better, they were more on the ascendancy.
"There wasn't too many goal-mouth opportunities but when you take a point against Hibs you've got to be pleased."
