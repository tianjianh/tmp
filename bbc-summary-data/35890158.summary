Widnes "fear nobody" in Super League after their impressive start, says head coach Denis Betts.

The Vikings are top of the table having won six of their opening seven games in 2016, including ending Wigan's 21-month unbeaten home record last week.
They travel to a Warrington side on Friday who have won all six of their fixtures so far.
"It's a strong, formidable side and that's the challenge for us and that's what excites this group," said Betts.
He told BBC Radio Merseyside: "We've got people to go after, we've got markers to set and we know that our confidence is high at the moment and we fear nobody."
The start the Cheshire side have made has been in stark contrast to previous years - they finished ninth last season before the Super 8s split, but comfortably qualified for the top tier this year.
Just four years ago, Widnes finished last, with their highest-ever standing coming in 2014 when they finished eighth.
"We're getting a little bit more interest from external media and everyone is coming in here and wants to know what the secret is - there is no secret," added Betts.
"We've recruited well, we've developed people we've got here, we've worked hard not just in the performance but the administration side of things, and have taken small steps.
"We've had a great start this year but is not just about now, it's about what's going to happen next week, in a month, as we don't want to be sat here at the end of the year thinking 'If only.'"
