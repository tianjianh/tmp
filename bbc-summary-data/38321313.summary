Loch Arthur Creamery cheese recall after listeria alert

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Two types of cheese produced by a creamery in southern Scotland are being recalled amid concerns over possible listeria food poisoning.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Food Standards Scotland said Loch Arthur Creamery's Crannog and Killywhan cheeses were being withdrawn from sale.
The creamery and cafÃ©, based near Dumfries, has notified businesses that sell the cheeses.
The watchdog said anyone who had bought the cheese should not eat it and could return it to shops for a refund.
Food Standards Scotland said the recall was a precautionary measure after Listeria monocytogenes was detected in batches of both products
Listeriosis, which is caused by the bacteria, can cause fever, muscle aches, diarrhoea. In rare cases it can lead to more serious complications such as meningitis.
Most at risk are elderly people, pregnant women, babies under a month old or people with a weakened immune system.
Loch Arthur Creamery, at Beeswing, is part of the Loch Arthur Camphill Community which runs two farms and a garden.
The shared rural community offers security, personal care and a "spiritual purpose" to people with special needs.
A statement on its Facebook page confirmed routine testing had indicated the presence of "a low level of listeria" in "a small number of batches" of its Crannog cheese.
"We immediately reported this to the environmental health department at Dumfries and Galloway Council," it said.
"We followed our documented procedures to deal with this issue and accordingly initiated a product recall on the affected cheese.
"As a precautionary measure, we have now extended that recall to all batches of Loch Arthur Creamery's Crannog and Killywhan cheese.
"We have halted production of these cheeses for the time being."
It said it was continuing to produce farmhouse cheese, cream cheese and yoghurt as those products had not been affected.
Customers who have placed Christmas hamper orders containing the items will receive alternative cheeses from other cheese makers.
"The team at Loch Arthur Creamery wish to thank our all our friends and customers for their support," the statement concluded.
