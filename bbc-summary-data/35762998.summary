Police said they were assisted in the house search by "specialist resources" following reports of a firearm in the Grangepans property.
Officers said 14 cannabis plants with an estimated street value of Â£3,000 were recovered.
The man was arrested for drug offences and a breach of the peace and will appear in court at a later date.
Officers attended the address on 3 March as part of Operation Core, which targets drug-related activity.
Despite initial reports of a firearm, Police Scotland said "there was found to be no risk to the public."
Sgt Craig Heron said: "Thanks to vital information passed to us by the community, we are confident that this recovery has disrupted the chain of supply in the local area.
"This was a highly successful operation that involved a number of officers and I thank local residents for their patience and cooperation.
"Drugs continue to blight our communities and pursuing those who are involved in this harmful trade remains one of our top priorities."
