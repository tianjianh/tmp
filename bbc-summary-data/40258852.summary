Everton have agreed a £30m deal with Sunderland for keeper Jordan Pickford.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Pickford, who is currently on duty with England Under-21s before the European Championship, is expected to have a medical and complete the formalities of the deal when he returns.
The 23-year-old will become the most expensive British keeper if he completes the move.
Pickford made 29 top-flight appearances last season but could not prevent Sunderland being relegated.
