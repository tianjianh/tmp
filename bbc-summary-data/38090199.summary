Progress on the business case for the North Denbighshire Community Hospital in Rhyl will be outlined this week.
Drop-in events next month will give people a chance to offer feedback.
The project includes a same day care centre for minor ailments, one for intravenous therapy and a new facility to help people regain skills needed to live independently.

Work will begin in 2018, pending planning consent and final approval.
