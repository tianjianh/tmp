[SN]TITLE[SN]
Koh-i-Noor - a gift at the point of a bayonet

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
That the Koh-i-Noor diamond carries a curse is no secret. However, the fact that it can turn government policy inside out within the space of 24 hours has been news to us all.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
First, the Indian solicitor-general stated that his country would not be pursing the return of the diamond. A day later, the Narendra Modi government said it would do everything in its power to "amicably" encourage the British to give back the gem.
Solicitor-General Ranjit Kumar's argument to the Supreme Court was that the Koh-i-Noor had not been "stolen nor forcibly taken away". Rather, it had been given to Britain by the successors of Maharajah Ranjit Singh "as compensation for help in the Sikh wars".
Such a bold full stop in a long-running dispute over the ownership of this fabulous 105-carat gem came as quite a shock to most Indians.
It was also wildly inaccurate. Maharajah Ranjit Singh, who once wore the uncut Koh-i-Noor on his bicep, died in 1839. Almost a decade later, the Koh-i-Noor was taken by the British, by force, from a frightened little boy, his son.
Therefore the diamond came to Britain thanks to dubious legality and very clear immorality.
The boy king, Duleep Singh, was only eight years old at the time he signed over his kingdom and the Koh-i-Noor to the British.
After the death of his father, the British had come to Punjab to befriend the new king.
Surreptitiously they garrisoned troops in the region, separated Duleep Singh from his mother (by dragging the screaming regent, Maharani Jindan, from his side and locking her in a tower) and contrived two Anglo-Sikh wars to further weaken his realm.
Alone and terrified, this small child was surrounded by grown British men, and told to sign away his future.
Later in life Duleep Singh would attempt to take legal action against the British over their conduct. But living in exile in England by this time, he was thwarted at every turn and eventually died a broke and broken man.
There have been previous attempts to get the diamond back but they have all stalled. I suspect none of the previous petitioners really expected to get the gem out of the Tower of London.
India is not the only nation in the game.
Earlier this year a British-trained barrister, Javed Iqbal Jaffry, successfully lodged a petition with a Pakistani court.
In Mr Jaffry's words: "Grabbing and snatching [the Koh-i-Noor] was a private, illegal act which is justified by no law or ethics".
Though the Indians want the stone in Delhi, he insists its true home is Lahore, the former capital of Duleep Singh's empire.
I am currently writing a history of the Koh-i-Noor with the splendid historian William Dalrymple, and we have both been up to our elbows in various dusty archives both here and in India.
Had the diamond truly been a gift, the Delhi Gazette, a British newspaper, would hardly have printed in May 1848: "This famous diamond (the largest and most precious in the world) forfeited by the treachery of the sovereign at Lahore, and now under the security of British bayonets at the fortress of Goindghur, it is hoped ere long, as one of the splendid trophies of our military valour, be brought to England in attention of the glory of our arms in India".
I don't know about you, but I don't know of many "gifts" that are handed over at the point of a bayonet.
