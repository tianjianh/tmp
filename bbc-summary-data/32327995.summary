[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
All-rounder Moeen Ali has been added to the England squad for the final two Tests in the West Indies.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 27-year-old left-handed batsman and off-spinner was not included in the original 16-man party because of a side strain suffered during the World Cup.
However, he made 62 and four on his comeback in Worcestershire's season-opening County Championship defeat by Yorkshire this week.
The first Test, currently under way in Antigua, is set to finish on Friday.

The England and Wales Cricket Board said Moeen will join up with the squad in Grenada on Saturday, before the second Test begins on 21 April.
The last match of the series in Barbados starts on 1 May.
Moeen averages 31.77 with the bat and 28.09 with the ball in the seven Tests he has played since making his debut in 2014.
Off-spinner James Tredwell, playing his second Test in Antigua five years after his debut, took 4-47 in the first innings.
Yorkshire leg-spinning all-rounder Adil Rashid is the other slow-bowling option in the England touring party.
