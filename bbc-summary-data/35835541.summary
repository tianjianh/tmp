The incident is one of four break-ins that occurred at the Britannia Enterprise Centre some time between Tuesday evening and Wednesday morning.
Police are appealing for information.
The other units broken into were Auto Stitch, George Monumental Masons and Pride and Groom where damage was caused to the doors but nothing was stolen.
A taxi sign, however, was also stolen from one of the vehicles parked at the centre.
