Drug-growing chicken farmer Edward James is jailed

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A chicken farmer who turned to growing illegal drugs to increase his profits has been jailed.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Edward James, 68, hired out his land to cannabis growers but was caught with 395 plants.
When police raided the farm in Devon, James told officers he began growing drugs because it made more money than chickens, Exeter Crown Court heard.
James, of View Farm, Bratton Fleming, Barnstaple, admitted producing cannabis and was jailed for 15 months.
The court heard the farmer was paid rent by two men who set up growing rooms in a lorry container and a barn and turned an electricity sub station into a drying room.
Sentencing, Recorder Timothy Grice said James knew he was housing "a substantial commercial operation for the production of drugs".
He said: "I am perfectly certain if you did not know immediately, you did very shortly afterwards and you did it for profit."
Nigel Wraith, for the prosecution, said the operation had the potential to produce 10kg (22lb) of cannabis worth between Â£68,000 and Â£109,000.
Gareth Evans, for the defence, said the men who set up the operation wrecked James's car following the police raid by way of retribution for losing the potential yield.
He said James's wife would suffer most from the prison sentence and would probably have to sell the farm.
