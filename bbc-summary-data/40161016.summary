Motherwell manager Stephen Robinson believes his latest signing, Craig Tanner, will be a creative force for the side.

The 22-year-old attacking midfielder has moved to Fir Park from Reading on a two-year contract.
"He can unlock doors, playing in little pockets across the front three, left side, right side or in behind the striker," Robinson said.
"He is a really good signing for the club and gives us something different."
Tanner is a graduate of Reading's youth set-up, and scored on his first-team debut against Newport. Loan spells at AFC Wimbledon and Plymouth Argyle, twice, followed, and he scored six goals in 34 appearances for the latter this season.
He becomes Motherwell's third signing of the summer - after Alex Fisher and Gael Bigirimana - as Robinson looks to rebuild following a campaign that saw the team finish ninth in the Premiership.
"I'm delighted to have joined, having good talks about the club with Stephen Robinson and Martin Foyle. It's a good day for me," Tanner said on the club website.
"I have a really positive feeling about the club and feel they are really building for the future."
