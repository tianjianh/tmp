However, Scotland's jobless rate of 3.9% was below the UK figure of 4.4%.
The number of people in work in Scotland reached 2.65m, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS).
Meanwhile, wage increases continued to fall further behind inflation.
Excluding bonuses, earnings rose by 2% year-on-year. However, inflation had hit an almost four-year high of 2.9% in May.
When the impact of inflation is factored in, real weekly wages fell by 0.5% compared with a year earlier.
