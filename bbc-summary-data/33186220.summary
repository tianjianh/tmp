[SN]TITLE[SN]
Gay marriage would not harm Church, bishop says

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The bishop who barred a clergyman from a hospital chaplain post because he was in a same-sex marriage admitted the appointment would not have damaged the Church.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Rt Rev Richard Inwood was speaking at a discrimination case brought by Canon Jeremy Pemberton against the Church.
The bishop told the hearing it was against Church of England doctrine.
But he said it would not "harm the [hospital] trust or Church".
Mr Pemberton brought the action against Bishop Inwood for discrimination after a licence to operate as a priest was refused when he married his partner Laurence Cunnington.
Although he was offered a job and would have been employed by Sherwood Forest Hospitals Trust, he needed permission to officiate from the bishop.
At the hearing in Nottingham, Bishop Inwood was asked what harm would come if Mr Pemberton was appointed.
"It is not a matter of danger, but by my own oath of honour and obedience, under authority, to maintain the doctrine of the church," he replied.
"It's my own personal choice."
The tribunal judge Peter Britton then pointed out the contradiction of arguing that the appointment was against the doctrines, established to protect the church, while also admitting it would not have harmed the church.
Bishop Inwood replied: "If you put it like that, I have to agree with you."
But he later said granting Canon Pemberton permission would have gone against guidance issued by the Church of England in 2014.
Mr Pemberton remains employed as a hospital chaplain in Lincolnshire and was issued with a formal rebuke by the Bishop of Lincoln after the wedding but no further action was taken, the tribunal was told.
The tribunal also heard that, following the refusal, Bishop Inwood was the subject of a social media and letter writing campaign from supporters of Mr Pemberton.
"Some of those emails I received were bonkers, frankly.
"Some were well-argued, some insulting, and some cast aspersions on my own marriage."
The hearing continues.
