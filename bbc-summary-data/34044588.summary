Stephen Powell, 48, took evasive action while watching Ashes highlights as a Volvo ploughed through the bay window of his Porthmawr Road home in Cwmbran.
The driver, Paul Binks, 29, of Newcastle, is not believed to have been injured in the crash on Friday.
On Saturday, he admitted drink-driving at Newport Magistrates' Court and was banned from the road for 18 months.
Mr Powell's wife, Sarah Roberts, 42, said: "If he hadn't thrown himself out of the way he would have been killed."
The father-of-one was taken to hospital with back pains and is believed to have suffered torn muscles.
Binks had 65 micrograms of alcohol per 100ml of his breath - the legal limit is 35 micrograms.
Alongside his disqualification from driving, Binks was also ordered by magistrates to pay Â£355 in fines and court costs.
