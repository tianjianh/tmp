Hope for 'Clare's Law' ahead of Aberdeen and Ayrshire pilot

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Aberdeen father of a woman murdered by her ex-boyfriend has said he hopes a new law to be piloted in Scotland will save women from a similar fate.

Clare Wood, 36, who was murdered in 2009 in Salford, was unaware of George Appleton's history of violence against women.
Clare's Law allows people to access information on the offending history of their new partner.
The law will be piloted from next week in Aberdeen and Ayrshire.
Ms Wood was strangled and set on fire at her home.
The victim's father, Michael Brown, said the Domestic Violence Disclosure Scheme would help protect those currently not receiving assistance.
Mr Brown, who campaigned for the introduction of Clare's Law, is convinced she would still be alive had she known the full extent of Appleton's previous behaviour.
He said he was "absolutely delighted" that the scheme had come into force.
Ms Wood, a mother-of-one, met Appleton on Facebook.
She knew nothing about his history of violence against women, which included threats, repeated harassment and the kidnapping at knifepoint of one of his ex-girlfriends.
Police began hunting for Appleton after Ms Wood's body was found at her home.
He was found hanged in a derelict pub six days later. An inquest into his death ruled he committed suicide.
