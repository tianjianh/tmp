Violet Grace Youens, who was knocked down on Friday died in hospital late on Saturday, Merseyside Police said.
Her nanny Angela French, 55, who was also hit by the car is described as being in a serious but stable condition after the crash in Prescot Road,  St Helens on Friday.
Police said a number of lines of inquiry were "being pursued".
Violet's mother Rebecca posted a tribute to her daughter on Facebook: "My beautiful baby girl passed away in my arms on 25/03/2017 at 23:38. Thank you for all your well wishes... she was just too poorly.
"However, my brave baby girl saved two lives by donating her kidneys and pancreas. I am truly heartbroken but proud of my little fighter! Violet-Grace Susan Youens 02/10/2012 - 25/03/2017."
The crash involved a black Ford Fiesta, which was then driven into a lamppost, before the two male occupants reportedly fled on foot.
Violet, who had a 21-month-old brother Oliver, had her pancreas and kidneys donated following her death, said Merseyside Police.
