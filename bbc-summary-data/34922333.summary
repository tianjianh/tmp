[SN]TITLE[SN]
Search for new Stirling Makar launched

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Stirling Council is looking for a poet to fill a ceremonial position that dates back to the 15th Century and the reign of James IV.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Stirling Makar role was revived in 2009 with the appointment of Magi Gibson and then Anita Govan in 2012.
Now the public are being invited to nominate the third Makar in recent times.
Holders of the post must live in Stirling or have a "strong connection with the area", the council said.
The Stirling Makar produces a poem each year that celebrates the Stirling area and its people.
Provost Mike Robbins said: "Through their work the Makar reconnects the modern, contemporary Stirling with its rich literary heritage.
"They also work to promote appreciation of poetry - and boost literacy in general - through work with community groups, including our schools."
The Makar is a civic appointment, with the post-holder appointed for a three-year term and receiving an honorarium of Â£1,000 a year.
Nominations can be emailed to the council. The deadline is 18 December and the new Makar will be announced on 24 February.
