Henley Regatta rowers suffer 'mysterious melting oars'

The hot weather may have caused a "mysterious case of melting oars" at Henley regatta, say organisers.

King's School Canterbury's rowing team was "scuppered" in its opening race on Wednesday, after an oar "parted company" from its shaft mid-race.
Canford School's race was then rescheduled after the team lost an oar on the way to the start of a race.
It came as the UK saw the hottest July day on record, with temperatures hitting 36.7C (98F).
A Henley Regatta spokesman said: "Today's extreme heat, it would appear, caused the glue to melt between the plastic 'spoon' and the carbon-fibre shaft of the high-tech oars."
Teams were taking part in the Princess Elizabeth Challenge Cup for schoolboy eights.
