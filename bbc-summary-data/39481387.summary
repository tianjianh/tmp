The Pilgrims, second in the table, were beaten by Accrington on Saturday, while Rovers won to extend their advantage.
"We're out of the title race now. Six points behind, Doncaster have a better goal difference - that's out of the question now," Adams told BBC Devon.
"We've still got a job to do, we've still got 18 points to play for."
Plymouth ended Doncaster's unbeaten home league record on 26 March to move within three points of Darren Ferguson's side, but Adams is now focused on simply securing promotion, having lost to AFC Wimbledon in last season's play-off final.
The Devon side need nine more points to be sure of going up to League One.
"The finishing line is there but you've got to do it. It's a wake-up call for everybody at the football club, not just the players," added Adams.
"We've got to try and gain that automatic promotion, but we have to play a lot better."
