[SN]TITLE[SN]
Anglesey landscape artist Wilf Roberts dies, aged 75

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Welsh artist Wilf Roberts has died, aged 75, following an illness.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
He found prominence for his landscape paintings, many of his native Anglesey.
After teaching and studying art at Croydon Art College in London during the 1960s, he returned home to the island in the 1970s before retiring to focus on painting in 1996.
He has had international success, with works held in public and private collections in The Hague, Paris, New York, Australia and the UK.
"The loss of a fine artist is always sad, and none more so than the news of Wilf Roberts' death after his illness of the past 18 months," friend and gallery owner Martin Tinney said.
"His integrity shone through when preparing for a new exhibition - not for him the churning out of numerous works to please an audience - he released pictures from his studio only when he was happy that they were 'ready'.
"Over the years, I was delighted to become a friend of Wilf and his devoted wife Sue. She has been his rock over the past difficult months and my heartfelt sympathy goes out to her and the family."
