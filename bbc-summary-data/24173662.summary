A new representative body has been launched in Scotland for letting agents in the private rented housing sector.

LetScotland - the Association of Professional Letting Agents in Scotland - said it would provide "a voice for honest, ethical, professional" agents.
Its aims include encouraging "a positive relationship" between landlords, agents and tenants.
It also wants to work with Scottish ministers on proposed legislation for the sector.
In May the Scottish government announced a new private rented sector strategy, which involved ministers working in partnership with letting agents on the introduction of new regulations for the industry.
LetScotland chairman Malcolm Warrack said: "We exist to provide a voice for the sector which is currently missing.
"We want to ensure that the important role of the private rented sector and its practitioners is positively reflected in public.
"And in private, we want to ensure that the sector is subject to legislation which reflects its importance and meets the needs of tenants, landlords and agents."
He added: "LetScotland will be pioneers for good conduct in the private rented sector.
"The minority of unethical agents damage our businesses and our sector and, as much as anyone else, we want tough sanctions available to act against them.
"So we will be open and transparent in our dealings. In return, we expect fairness and accurate representation."
