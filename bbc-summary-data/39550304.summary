[SN]TITLE[SN]
Torquay United 3-1 Braintree Town

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Brett Williams scored twice as Torquay gave their National League survival bid a massive boost with a 3-1 comeback victory against fellow relegation strugglers Braintree.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The visitors took just eight minutes to open the scoring, Chez Isaac delivering a great free-kick which Manny Parry headed in from close range for his second goal of the season.
The Gulls thought they had equalised in the 36th minute when Williams latched on to a blocked clearance to fire home the loose ball with a low shot, but referee Craig Hicks disallowed it after consulting with his assistant.
However, five minutes later Williams did level with a low shot into the bottom corner to give Torquay a lifeline and then added a second seven minutes after the break, rifling home a loose ball inside the area.
Williams nearly scored a hat-trick when his header struck the post and although the Iron later hit the crossbar, Jordan Lee made the points safe in the final minute to leave the Gulls just a point away from safety with two games to go.
