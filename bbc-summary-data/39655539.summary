The 30-year-old reportedly met a group of men on the beach at King's Esplanade in Hove and began chatting to them, then two of the men raped her.
Details of the assault have just been released by Sussex Police who said it happened sometime between 01:00 BST and 03:00 BST on 5 April.
The woman, who was visiting the city, rang a friend straight after the attack and they reported it to police.
Det Sgt Julie Greenwood said: "The victim describes the men as possibly Romanian.
"We are appealing to anyone who lives or was in the King's Esplanade area and saw or heard anything suspicious."
