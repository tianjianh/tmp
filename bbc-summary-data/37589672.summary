[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Farid El Alagui scored three goals - one of them for the wrong team - as Dunfermline Athletic beat Queen's Park in the Scottish Challenge Cup.

The Pars striker was introduced at the break after a dreadful first half and immediately lit up East End Park by smashing home from six yards.
El Alagui added another when he rose to head in Joe Cardle's cross.
But the striker made the passage slightly uneasy by heading Darren Miller's corner into his own net.
Spiders midfielder Miller was sure he had deserved a goal of his own earlier - his low in-swinging corner blocked by goalkeeper Murdoch with the Queen's Park players insisting it had crossed the line.
El Alagui could have had more goals than the two he registered at the right end.
His first was despatched swiftly past Spiders goalkeeper Willie Muir from six yards after the ball dropped for him nicely following Michael Paton's corner.
After Queen's Park's Anton Brady forced a good save from Murdoch, El Alagui then beat Muir to Cardle's deliverly from the left-hand-side to nod in at the near post.
The own goal briefly unsettled the hosts, but Allan Johnston's side should have extended their lead, with El Alagui, Paton, David Hopkirk and Cardle all having efforts saved or go off target.
Dunfermline Athletic striker Farid El Alagui: "I think that's the first time I have scored an own goal. I was like 'oh no, that's not ideal'.
"It's okay because we won and I managed to score two at the other end, but it's not a nice feeling to score an own goal, so I hope it's the last one.
"The boys tried to give me the match ball, but I refused to take it!"
