Braintree WI nimble knitters stitch up the town

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Nimble-fingered knitters have created a woolly version of an Essex town.

Members of Braintree's Dolphin Women's Institute (WI) have stitched some of the town's best-known landmarks including the church and museum.
Each model is about 45cm (18in) tall and was created using a polystyrene or cardboard core with knitting sewn on.
It took nine knitters seven months to complete the seven miniature buildings which will be displayed at the town's museum next month.
The group's vice-president, Elaine Pye, said the project was inspired by a similar one a relative had been involved in knitting in Hertfordshire.
"They knitted their own cottages, but we couldn't really do that so chose some of the town's beautiful iconic buildings," she said.
Mrs Pye put together the polystyrene structures and each knitter got to work, returning after two weeks with their latest knitted piece of church spire or pub frontage.
After much gluing, sewing and additional knitted embellishments, the town finally took shape, brought together with mini woollen market stalls.
The group created models of the town hall, church, Swan pub, library, museum, shopping centre and even the railway station complete with knitted train.
"It really brought everyone together and the response has been amazing," Mrs Pye said.
"So much so that they want to do more, so we think we might knit the Public Gardens next."
