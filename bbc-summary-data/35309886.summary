James McDonagh was attacked outside a bar on the Hillhead Road in the early hours of Sunday morning.
On Thursday, a 24-year-old was charged with his murder at Londonderry Magistrates Court.
Finbar McCoy, from Loughbeg Road Toomebridge, was remanded in custody to appear again next month.
A detective told the court that the victim had been punched once in the head and fell backwards.
He said that "brought on the tragedy of his death".
When cautioned  and charged with murder, Mr McCoy said: "I can't bring words together to say how sorry I am. I feel so sad for the family but I did not murder James McDonagh."
A detective confirmed that the accused had co-operated with police.
