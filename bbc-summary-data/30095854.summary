Plan for A9's Berriedale Braes hairpin bend to be displayed

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Transport Scotland will present a draft outline of the proposed improvements to a challenging hairpin bend on the A9 in Caithness next week.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The A9 drops from 150m (492ft) to 20m (65ft) as it enters a valley at the Berriedale Braes.
Transport Scotland will run an exhibition at Berriedale Parish Church in Berriedale on 26 November outlining the proposed work.
The plans will also be made available on the agency's website.
The draft road orders for the work involved will be published on Friday.
Transport Minister Keith Brown said: "The hairpin bend and steep hill at Berriedale Braes has presented drivers with a very challenging road to negotiate - and is why we are working hard towards delivering improvements right along the A9, including at the Braes."
In August, the Scottish Chambers of Commerce (SCC) called for work to tackle the bend to be accelerated.
The Berriedale Braes were the scene of a lorry fire on 5 August which blocked the road for five hours. A 77-mile (124 km) detour was unsuitable for HGVs.
The SCC said accidents were a "frequent occurrence" and adversely affected businesses in the far north and Orkney.
Transport Scotland said a solution to the hairpin was being progressed.
