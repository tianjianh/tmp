Lawro's opponents for the FA Cup fourth-round weekend are indie-rock band The Libertines.
Pete Doherty is well known for being a QPR fan, while band-mates Carl Barat and Gary Powell both support Arsenal.
"The closest QPR have come to winning the FA Cup was when we lost in the final to Tottenham in 1982," Doherty told BBC Sport. "I was three and I remember crying a lot afterwards, which was strange because I was a happy child, but even then I knew what was what.
"It is a hard thing for me to admit, because I am not a Spurs fan, but the best FA Cup final song is 'Spurs are on their way to Wembley' by Chas and Dave in 1981.
"There is a certain beautiful melodic lyrical quality to the lyrics 'Ossie's going to Wembley, his knees have gone all trembley, tra-la-la-la, tra-la-la-la'."
The Libertines did not manage a prediction for Derby vs Man Utd on Friday night, and think Nottingham Forest's tie with Watford will be postponed because of a waterlogged pitch (which seems especially unlikely because very little rain is forecast in Nottingham in the build-up to the game).
But they backing the Gunners and Manchester City to reach round five, and think QPR's west London rivals Chelsea will lose 6-0 at MK Dons.
"All form goes out of the window on FA Cup day," added Doherty.
* Away team to win at home in the replay
** Postponement predicted (because of a waterlogged pitch)
