He and a 24-year-old man were stabbed in a flat in Kingsley Wood Drive, Mottingham, on Saturday afternoon.
The man of 20, who is yet to be formally named, was a student at Bexley College and an aspiring footballer.
Two young women and two children under the age of three were present when the attack happened, police said.
A man in his 20s has been arrested on suspicion of murder and remains in police custody.
The injured man remains in hospital with serious injuries but his condition has been described as stable.
Officers were called to the scene just after 15:00 BST. The 20-year-old was pronounced dead about an hour later.
He died from a single stab wound, a post-mortem examination found.
Describing the victim as "an immaculate individual of good character", Det Ch Insp Cliff Lyons said: "He was a promising student, he was studying at Bexley College, he was studying law and business studies.
"He was a very keen sportsman. He recently had trials at Queens Park Rangers.
"He was an entirely innocent victim (who was) at the wrong place at the wrong time".
The families of both the victims, who suffered multiple stab wounds, were "devastated".
He added: "The assault was witnessed by two young women, below the age of 21, and also two children below the age of three in a block of flats that's residential where there aren't any records of particular violence or community concerns in the area. So it's quite a shocking incident."
Mr Lyons said officers are looking for a black Volkswagen Golf, registration LV07 FXA, which they believe could be parked on a road in Greenwich, Lewisham or Bromley.
The incident is not gang or drugs related, police said.
