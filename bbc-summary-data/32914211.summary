Wheelie bin stickers urge NI motorists to see 'red' and give squirrels a 'brake'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
It may seem a little nuts, but a new road safety campaign launched by The Northern Ireland Squirrel Forum (NISF) is urging motorists to 'see red'.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Red squirrels are one of Ireland's most iconic, native mammals, but numbers are in steep decline as bigger and more aggressive, non-native, grey squirrels invade their habitat and spread disease.
Cars also pose a major threat. More than 70 red squirrels have been killed by motorists in the last few years and many more injured.
The NISF, in partnership with red squirrel groups across Northern Ireland, is appealing to drivers to "slow your speed, save our red squirrels".
The forum is encouraging householders to do their part by displaying squirrel warning signs on outside bins to highlight the danger to passing traffic.
Daniel McAfee, chair of the Glens Red Squirrel Group, said: "Too many of Northern Ireland's red squirrels are victims of speeding cars.
"Because of the greys, they are now confined to small patches of woodland. When they try to migrate across roads and start new populations, increasing numbers are being killed by cars.
"If motorists slow down, they will give the squirrels a fighting chance."
Squirrel groups have identified several Northern Ireland accident 'black spots' where there are currently strong red squirrel populations.
Together with members of the NISF, and Ulster Wildlife, they have devised a way in which householders in these areas can do their bit.
Mr McAfee said: "We are not permitted to display permanent signs, but as wheelie bins are set on road edges at least once a week, the stickers are a great opportunity to get the message across.
"Hopefully, drivers in these areas will see the stickers and note that red squirrels may be crossing the roads in their area."
Roads and areas identified as a significant problem for red squirrels are:
County Antrim has the largest number of squirrel road deaths with 54 of the endangered mammals killed on its roads.
In County Fermanagh, there have been 10 reds killed and in the area surrounding Mount Stewart in County Down, there have been eight.
However, these are only the incidents the squirrel forum is aware of. The actual number of reds killed or injured by cars is likely to be much higher.
The Forestry Commission estimates that there are only 140,000 red squirrels left in the UK compared with more than 2.5 million greys. So the future of the red squirrel in Northern Ireland is under severe threat.
Grey squirrels were first introduced to the UK from North America in the late 19th century.
To obtain a bin sticker, contact your local red squirrel group or email: squirrels@doeni.gov.uk
If you see either red or grey squirrels, or pine martens in your area, record your sightings online at: www2.habitas.org.uk/records/squirrels.
