Last Saturday the club were forced to cancel the opening meeting at their new Â£8m home because of the track state.
Manchester's Lord Mayor opened the venue on Saturday but the sell-out 5,000 crowd went home disappointed.
The Aces lost to Poole Pirates in the play-off final last season.
"The contractors who built the track and built the stadium have had to do some remedial work on the track because of the problems we had," chief executive David Gordon told BBC Radio Manchester.
"Those works we anticipated would have been completed for the Good Friday meeting but unfortunately the track is still unsatisfactory.
"We didn't build the track, the contractor built the track. It appears that the problem was in the sub base of the track, not in the shale of the track.
"Speedway tracks are a very, very specialised surface and when they start to break up it makes it very dangerous for the riders."
