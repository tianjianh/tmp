A pilot project at a Nottingham hospital that aims to reduce the length of stay for elderly patients has received a £500,000 boost.

Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust (NUH) said in early findings patients in its scheme stayed three fewer days than other older patients.
The scheme involves visiting discharged patients within 48 hours to ensure they have everything that they need.
If successful the trial could be rolled out UK-wide, it is thought.
The Community In-reach Rehabilitation and Care Transition (CIRACT) service said a full clinical trial would begin in February 2013.
The project began in July 2011 at Queen's Medical Centre, where its overall capacity is nine patients per week on one elderly medical care ward.
NUH said if successful over an average year it could save 1,258 bed days with a cost saving of £295,630, for one ward.
