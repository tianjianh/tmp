FA wants England manager to build strong identity, not short-term fix

England bosses want the next manager to build a strong team identity rather than provide a short-term fix.

Roy Hodgson resigned after England suffered a surprise last-16 exit to Iceland at Euro 2016 last week.
The Football Association has already spoken to former internationals including Frank Lampard, Rio Ferdinand and Gary Lineker as part of its review.
It has not ruled out an interim appointment, with World Cup 2018 qualifying beginning in September.
However, Under-21 boss Gareth Southgate has ruled himself out of succeeding Hodgson either temporarily or on a permanent basis.
A three-man panel - FA technical director Dan Ashworth, chief executive Martin Glenn and vice-chairman David Gill - met in Paris last Friday and have identified three key areas on which to focus:
As well as ex-England players, the FA has consulted former Tottenham and West Ham manager Harry Redknapp about England performances at previous tournaments.
The governing body is keen that the link-up between development teams and the senior squad is brought closer, with a more cohesive link at St George's Park with the new manager.
Sunderland manager Sam Allardyce and United States boss Jurgen Klinsmann are among the favourites to fill the vacant position.
The FA wants a strong-minded, tactically savvy manager who will build a clear team identity and help shape the team into a cohesive unit.
Following the defeat by Iceland, BBC Match of the Day pundit and former England striker Alan Shearer said: "We were out-fought, out-thought, out-battled and totally hopeless for 90 minutes. It looked to me like Roy was making it up as he was going along."
Former Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers was linked with the job, but having recently joined Celtic he denied the speculation and said England "obviously have to appoint someone and look at creating an identity, a way the team can play".
Former England winger Chris Waddle added on BBC Radio 5 live: "We haven't got leaders, they're all pampered, they're all [listening to] headphones and you can't get anything out of them."
Meanwhile, Match of the Day host and former England striker Lineker said England had "no real game plan, no plan B".
"They need to know on the pitch exactly what their jobs are, what they're supposed to do in certain circumstances and I'm not sure that was the case," he added.
"It's like an actor. An actor can be as good as he likes but he still needs a really good director."
