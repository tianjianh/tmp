[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The musical is based on Mel Brooks' Oscar-nominated film which starred Gene Wilder as Dr Frederick Frankenstein, a descendant of the deranged Victor.
Living in New York, he tries to play down the family name, until he inherits the infamous castle and discovers Victor's book: "How I Did It".
Noble will play Frankenstein's hunchbacked servant, Igor.
Joseph will appear as housekeeper Frau Blucher, whose very name causes horses to rear in fright; while West End star Hadley Fraser will take the main role of Dr Frederick Frankenstein.
Brooks will produce the show, which will open for a pre-West End season in Newcastle on 26 August until 9 September.
It will then open at the Garrick Theatre on 28 September.
The musical previously ran on Broadway between 2007 and 2009.
The cult film on which it's based was co-written by Brooks and Wilder, and earned them an Oscar nomination for best adapted screenplay.
