Bournemouth to appeal against Simon Francis red card in Arsenal draw

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Bournemouth are appealing against Simon Francis' red card in the 3-3 draw with Arsenal on Tuesday.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Defender Francis, 31, was dismissed for a challenge on midfielder Aaron Ramsey as the Gunners came from 3-0 down to rescue a point at the Vitality Stadium.
Cherries boss Eddie Howe said it was a "harsh" decision by referee Michael Oliver to send off Francis, before Olivier Giroud equalised in added time.
"It was a foul but I don't think it was a sending-off," said Howe.
The club expect to hear the outcome of their appeal by the end of the week.
If the appeal is unsuccessful, Francis will miss Saturday's FA Cup third-round tie with Millwall as well as Premier League games against Hull City and Watford.
