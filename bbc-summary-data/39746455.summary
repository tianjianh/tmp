The brothers' associate Amanda Spencer, who was found guilty of four child prostitution offences, was jailed for three years. That sentence will run consecutively with a 12-year jail term imposed in 2014 for similar offences.
Taleb Bapir, who was convicted of rape, was jailed for 10 years.
Jailing the group, Judge Peter Kelson said: "You succumbed to your greed for sexual satisfaction and financial gain.
"I have never in my professional life witnessed such broken humanity."
The jury heard the 15-year-old was given drink and drugs before being forced to have sex.
Prosecutor Peter Hampton said: "The Whiteley brothers would take [the girl] to the red light district [in Sheffield] where she would be prostituted.
"She would be forced to get in to cars.
"She would be driven to secluded areas where she would have sex for money. The brothers would charge Â£50.
"Her best guess is that this occurred on around 30 to 40 occasions."
He told the court other victims in the case were raped, abused and prostituted after meeting the Whiteley brothers and Spencer at Sheffield's former Castle Market.
Spencer took one girl to up to 50 properties and forced her to have sex with men, including Bapir, for money.
Judge Kelson told Spencer: "You knew how vulnerable she was but you didn't care.
"You knew what it was like to be exploited but you didn't care.
"You knew that she didn't want to do this but you didn't care.
"You sold her body."
Peter Mann, from the Crown Prosecution Service, said: "These defendants cynically targeted and sexually exploited young and vulnerable girls.
"The suffering the victims must have endured is hard to comprehend."
