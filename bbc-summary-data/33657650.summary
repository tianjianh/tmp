He then fled to another, unoccupied, house next door when she raised the alarm. It happened in Tirowen Drive in Lisburn, County Antrim, in the early hours of Friday.
Police said they found a man in a "distressed and agitated state" inside the second house.
A 38-year-old man was taken to hospital while in police custody.
He has since been discharged from hospital.
All the front windows, and most of the back, were smashed in the second house the intruder went into.
The 78-year-old man who lives in the house was away on holiday.
His son-in-law told the BBC: "Smashed windows, wrecked furniture. It was as if there was a blood bath in the house because the man lost a lot of blood wandering from room to room trying to escape the police.
"He came from the house next door and was trying to get away from the police and then smashed the window, got into this house and the police had to lay siege. He was here from about three hours."
The woman and child in the other house were not injured.
Police said local officers sought the assistance of the PSNI armed response unit while negotiating with the man.
Officers from this unit then entered the house and disarmed him.
Police have appealed for witnesses.
