Walsall: Jon Whitney to take charge following Sean O'Driscoll sacking

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Walsall performance coach Jon Whitney is to take control of first-team affairs at Bescot following the departure of Sean O'Driscoll.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Sunday's sacking of O'Driscoll has prompted the club to turn again to the trio who took charge following Dean Smith's exit to Brentford in November.
Whitney, 45, will be assisted by Neil Cutler, the club's goalkeeping coach.
Vastly experienced professional development coach John Ward is the third member of Whitney's team.
The club have not said how long this arrangement will last and they say they will be making no further comment.
Walsall, fourth in League One after a winless six-game run, are next in action at Chesterfield on Saturday.
