[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
George Williams landed a drop goal as Wigan Warriors earned a thrilling Super League draw at Huddersfield.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Tries from Leroy Cudjoe and Lee Gaskell put the Giants ahead, with Danny Brough adding a drop goal, while John Bateman and Liam Marshall replied for Wigan.
Huddersfield's one-point half-time lead was wiped out as Marshall grabbed his second try of the night.
Jermaine McGillvary's try swung the game back in the Giants' favour, but Williams denied them victory.
Williams was just short with a drop-goal attempt from 60 metres with four minutes remaining, while Tommy Leuluai's attempt for Wigan in the last minute drifted just wide.
It was the second draw of the season between the two sides following their 16-16 stalemate at the DW Stadium in March.
Huddersfield are now unbeaten in the last four matches, but Wigan's recent struggles continue and they are now without a win in their last eight league games.
Earlier, the home side went ahead through Cudjoe when he found space down the right-hand side to drive through the Wigan defence and slide over, and Gaskell chased down Brough's kick to score their second.
Martyn Ridyard and Brough added the conversations, while the latter put over a drop goal, as Huddersfield opened up a 13-0 lead.
Wigan roared back into the game on the half-hour mark as Bateman scored under pressure, and Marshall touched down a grubber kick from Williams, who added the extras for the second time in four minutes.
Warriors overturned the home side's narrow one-point lead within three minutes of the restart as Marshall ran in acrobatically the left-hand side for his second try of the game to give Wigan the lead for the first time.
But McGillvary touched down on the right to give Giants the advantage, before Williams had the final word, with both teams remaining mid-table in Super League.
Huddersfield coach Rick Stone:
"I'm probably happy enough in the end. We had a good first 20 or 25 minutes and I thought we gave up that lead too easily through giving away too many penalties.
"There wasn't much in it in the second half. Both sides showed plenty of desperation, desire and willingness to take the points, which was good.
"We probably managed the game better than last week, but I'm pleased with the confidence we can take out of that to move on in the next couple of weeks."
Wigan boss Shaun Wane:
"It was not good enough. There were too many penalties and too many errors - we didn't give ourselves a chance to win.
"We still managed to stay in there and get a point and they are a very confident team at the moment. But overall I am not happy.
"We had our chances to win but giving away penalties on play five and dropping the ball on play one gave ourselves too much work. We are not going to get a win doing that."
