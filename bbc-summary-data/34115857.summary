Borders Railway housing market impact still awaited

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Borders Railway has yet to have an impact on the housing market along its route, according to new figures from Registers of Scotland (RoS).

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
In the last three years, the volume of residential sales within five miles of the new stops has risen.
However, the increase is less than that in the wider local authority areas of Midlothian and the Scottish Borders.
House prices have also risen along the route since 2006 but again the council-wide figure has been higher.

Since 2012, the volume of residential sales within five miles of the new stops has risen by 50.2% in Midlothian, and 26.3% in the Borders.
Figures for the whole council areas rose by 60.6% and 30.1% respectively and by 28.2% in Scotland as a whole.
RoS also found house prices had been "largely unaffected".
Since 2006 when the bill was approved to reopen the railway, average prices in the Midlothian catchment area have grown 6.1% to £166,639, while houses within five miles of the new Borders stations have seen average prices increase of 4.5% to £143,283.
Council-wide area figures for the same period are 13.4% in Midlothian and 9.5% in the Borders with the Scottish increase at 16.1%
RoS' head of data, Rhona Mackay, said: "We have seen an increase in the volume of sales around the new Borders railway stations, but this is slightly lower than the volumes seen in the local authority areas as a whole.
"Prices are also up, but again this is lower in the five mile catchment areas than the wider local authority areas where the increase is more substantial.
"It is widely expected that the new line will stimulate interest in the property market in the areas close to the stations, and there have already been a number of new-build developments within the railway catchment areas in recent years, so it will be interesting to revisit these statistics again once the new link is up and running."
The Borders Railway opens to the public on Sunday between Tweedbank and Edinburgh.
It has seven new stops along its length including Newtongrange and Gorebridge in Midlothian, and Stow and Galashiels in the Borders.
