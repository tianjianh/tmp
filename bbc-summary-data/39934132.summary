Election 2017: Plaid Cymru manifesto at-a-glance

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Plaid Cymru has launched its manifesto for the 2017 general election. It is available online here. Here is a guide to the 52-page document.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Plaid Cymru says that Wales faces "grave risks" at the general election, claiming the nation is "under threat from the cruel and reckless Tories".
It says that Labour is weak and divided and is not able to offer opposition to the Conservatives.
Plaid Cymru's "Action Plan 2017" pitches to fight for the best possible Brexit deal for Wales' industry and agriculture.
The party says Wales' economy, identity and its devolved legislature - the National Assembly for Wales - need protecting from a Conservative power grab.
There is a big Brexit focus in the document. The party says it will:
The party says it will:
Both these issues are devolved to the National Assembly for Wales and the Welsh Government.
However, the manifesto commits Plaid Cymru to:

Control over education is also devolved to Welsh institutions. Plaid Cymru says it would:
Pensions and social security
Plaid Cymru wants to see powers over social security devolved to Wales. It also pledges to:

Manifesto promises include:
The manifesto says that it remains Plaid Cymru's ambition for Wales to become an independent nation "standing on its own two feet".
But the document says this election is about an "immediate threat" to Wales. The document commits Plaid to:
Labour's Christina Rees: "The simple fact remains that this general election is a straight fight between Welsh Labour and the Tories. Leanne Wood knows her party cannot win the election, and a vote for Plaid Cymru could help hand victory to the Tories."
The Welsh Conservatives' Andrew RT Davies: "Plaid Cymru's manifesto talks spiritedly about seizing opportunities, but neglects to mention how many opportunities for change they have simply frittered away by propping up Labour again and again."
The Welsh Liberal Democrats' Mark Williams said: "This election is about the type of country we want to be. Who says you have to settle for Theresa May's cold, mean-spirited country? The Liberal Democrats are making the case for an optimistic, hopeful and tolerant country."
A UKIP Wales spokesman said: "Plaid Cymru continues to fail to acknowledge that Wales voted to Leave the European Union, and fails to respect the wishes of the Welsh people... Having UKIP MPs in the House of Commons will ensure Wales gets the best possible deal from Brexit."
In common with other past Welsh general election manifestos from across the political divide, Plaid Cymru has produced a wide-ranging manifesto that includes policies that concern issues devolved to the National Aseembly for Wales.
Broadly, AMs and Welsh ministers have control over health, education, some elements of tax such as business rates, agriculture, tourism and most transport issues.
It is MPs that take decisions on most taxes, international affairs, justice and policing, benefits, pensions, defence and the constitution of the country.
Plaid Cymru only stands MPs in Wales and could not form a government alone - if it was to see its policies implemented in Westminster it would need make arrangements with a larger party.
Full costings have not been made available to the media - however the party says the manifesto is fully costed.
