[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Wakefield held off a Leigh fightback to move up to sixth in Super League.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The visitors raced into a 20-0 lead with tries from Jacob Miller, Danny Kirmond and Reece Lyne but Curtis Naughton, Jamie Acton and Matty Dawson had Leigh back in it at the break.
Dawson got his second before Naughton completed his double to give Centurions a 26-22 lead.
However, Joe Arundel and Mason Caton-Brown ran in and Kirmond touched down again to give Trinity the win.
Leigh will take heart from their performance but defeat means they have now lost eight consecutive games in all competitions and they will slip to the bottom if Widnes beat Hull FC on Sunday.
The hosts looked like they would be blown away after Wakefield built a 20-0 lead in 14 minutes after Miller had crossed inside just three and Kirmond grabbed his first try before they had touched the ball again.
After Lyne completed their early blitz Centurions coach Neil Jukes saw his side score five unanswered tries before Danny Tickle was sent to the sin-bin shortly after Arundel's try had handed the advantage back to Wakefield.
Trinity made the most of their extra man, with Caton-Brown darting over and Kirmond wrapping up the win under the posts.
Leigh coach Neil Jukes:
"I wasn't pleased with effort in the first eight minutes when all we did was defend.
"We were soft defensively but when we started to get a grip on things we gave ourselves a chance.
"We showed great character to fight back from 20-0 down and then be in front. But again it was a case of not having the quality to make the right calls at the right time and we are missing that bit of quality."
Wakefield coach Chris Chester:
"It was a bizarre game. We controlled the ball really well and for about 10-15 minutes I don't think Leigh touched the ball.
"We deserved the two points but we allowed Leigh back into the game with some poor discipline. Leigh are a good side and we knew they were going to challenge us.
"We are pleased to get a win because this is a tough place to come and the crowd got behind them."
