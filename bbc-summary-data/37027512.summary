'Fairer' pay call for Scotland's artists

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Low pay for artists could mean their work loses its "edge and relevance", according to the public body that supports the industry in Scotland.

Creative Scotland has called for a greater commitment to pay artists fairly.
The agency said people from wealthier backgrounds were more likely to become artists.
The Scottish Government said more needed to be done to ensure artists can realise their potential.
In its Arts Strategy, Creative Scotland called for action to help artists sustain themselves throughout their careers.
According to the report: "It is those from wealthier backgrounds that are most likely to consider entering into the arts professionally today.
"This trend carries real risks if UK culture becomes homogenized and disconnected from the breadth of society and loses its edge and relevance within the world today."
Creative Scotland said the strategy covered dance, literature and publishing, music, theatre, visual arts, creative learning and equalities, diversity and inclusion.
Leonie Bell, the director of arts and engagement at Creative Scotland said: "Artists, cultural producers and arts organisations are a central part of a healthy, innovative, and dynamic society. Art and culture sit at the heart of who we are as a nation."
Scotland Culture Secretary Fiona Hyslop said: "I welcome the publication of Creative Scotland's Arts Strategy with its strong identification of the strengths and opportunities for arts in Scotland but with a sense of realism of the challenges facing individual artists and what can and should be done to support them.
"We have a vibrant, confident arts scene in Scotland but we need to do more to ensure that artists and also young people in wider community can realise more fully their potential. "
Creative Scotland said it would stage a number of debates across the country over the next two years to discuss and promote the strategy.
