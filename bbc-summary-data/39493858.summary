David Jeffrey was able to collect Â£66,000 from the bank fraud over the course of a year.
Jedburgh Sheriff Court heard that the 37-year-old opened the accounts at banks in the Scottish Borders between August 2014 and August 2015.
He was sentenced to 28 months in prison after admitting the charges.
Det Con Angus Hood, from Police Scotland's financial investigations unit, said: "The police investigation revealed that David Jeffrey carried out a calculated fraudulent scheme over a period of one year allowing him to obtain funds totalling over Â£60,000.
"His conviction should send a clear message that we will pursue all lines of inquiry to ensure that the perpetrators of fraud are brought to account for their actions."
