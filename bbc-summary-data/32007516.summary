Thick black smoke could be seen billowing out of a "well-developed fire" at the deep water facility from about 09:45.
Scottish Fire and Rescue said the blaze was in a ship loader and conveyor system used for loading coal from the terminal.
They said the fire had been contained and there were no injuries.
At one point firefighters had to be withdrawn to a safe distance due to the partial collapse of a section of the machinery.
The blaze was tackled by a firefighting tug, a high-reach appliance and ground monitors.
The facility, operated by Clydeport, can handle thousands of tonnes of coal an hour.
The damaged loader is thought to supply coal to feeder ships to be transferred to coal-fired power stations in Northern Ireland.
Coal from the Hunterston terminal also supplies Longannet power station in Fife and some plants in England.
