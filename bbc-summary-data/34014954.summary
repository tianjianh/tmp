Greater Manchester Police were called to the Westcoast Train Care facility on Kirkmanshulme Lane, Longsight, just before 02:30 BST.
A cordon was put in place while the bag was examined.
Police at the scene later said there was "not believed to be any threat to the public" and the investigation was passed to British Transport Police.
However, delays of up to 30 minutes to and from the station were expected until 11:00.
Commuters are already facing road delays in the city while a hole which has closed part of the Mancunian Way is filled in.
