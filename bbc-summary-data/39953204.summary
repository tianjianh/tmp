The 18-year-old will join Posh upon the expiry of his deal at Championship side Birmingham, which ends in June.
Tibbetts, who failed to make a first-team appearance at Blues, had been training with Peterborough last season.
"He is one for the future and he is here to push the new number one who we are working on at the moment," said Posh manager Grant McCann.
He becomes Posh's third summer signing, after the arrivals of Ricky Miller and Danny Lloyd.
