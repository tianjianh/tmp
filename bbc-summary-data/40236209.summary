He posted figures of 6-70 as the hosts were bowled for 175 before tea, having taken the final Sussex wicket early on.
Leicestershire's middle order crumbled with only Harry Dearden (36) and Zak Chappell (27 not out) offering fight.
Needing 232 to win, Ben Raine bowled Harry Finch and had Chris Nash caught but Sussex closed well-placed on 100-2.
Sussex's Danny Briggs, who contributed 27 to Sussex's first-innings 10th-wicket partnership of 83 with Vernon Philander, took 3-40 during Leicestershire's second innings and saw out the day as nightwatchman alongside Luke Wells.
Archer's bowling display was all the more timely as an ankle injury prevented South African Philander from bowling.
Sussex need 132 runs to win on the final day and deny their opponents a first Division Two win of the season.
Sussex seamer Archer told BBC Radio Sussex:
"The wicket didn't change much from the first two days - it's just a wicket where you have to be consistent with your line and length.
"Briggsy pretty much had the holding role and he did very well to pick up some wickets as well - it's always a bonus, it gives the pacers less to do.
"I'm feeling tired now - it's always good to be off, my work's done and we have a two week rest so it's fine."
Leicestershire's Clint McKay told BBC Radio Leicester:
"I think they're slightly ahead of the game - they've played very nice cricket throughout the day and we probably didn't help ourselves out, especially with the bat.
"The game's definitely in the balance - a couple of early wickets tomorrow and I think it'll make for an interesting day.
"All in all I think it's quite a good pitch, it's about us hanging in there and making sure we hit the top of the stumps enough tomorrow until one of those balls does something off the wicket."
