Plaid Cymru's manifesto: What is in it?

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Plaid Cymru is the first out of the blocks with this year's election campaign manifestos - but what does it promise?

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The party, which is pitching itself as an alternative government for Wales, already launched some of its policies earlier this year.
They included the recruitment of 1,000 extra doctors and 5,000 nurses, the abolition of care home charges for the elderly and a proposal to pay off £18,000 of university debt if students return to Wales.
But the manifesto stretches far beyond the initial nine point plan, with a huge document some 194 pages long.
Plaid promises to save 10,000 lives between 2016 and 2026 through a range of measures, including action on public health actions and promoting individual lifestyle changes.
They include ensuring earlier diagnosis of disease and better access to life-saving treatments. "Overall we will reduce preventable deaths by 25% by 2026," the manifesto says.
And in a major shake-up to how the NHS is run, Plaid says it will fully integrate primary, community and adult social care.
It says it would create a "National Network of Acute and Specialist Hospitals", and consult on whether this will be run directly by the Welsh Government's Department of Health or by an arms-length NHS Board.
Community health services, such as GPs' surgeries, district nurses and mental health, would be run by local government.
Local health boards would be replaced with a "Community NHS" system delivered through new Regional Combined Authorities - new strategic bodies that will provide strategic planning for local government.
Plaid Cymru thinks the current tuition fee grant scheme is unsustainable and wants to end it and replace it with an entirely new system.
In its manifesto the party says it will reform student finance so that Welsh students who work in Wales after graduation will receive £6,000 a year, up to a maximum of £18,000.
Plaid also wants to:
Plaid Cymru promises a "national economic plan" to put Wales on a par with the rest of the UK "within a generation".
It says it aims to close the 30% income gap that has opened up between Wales and the rest of the UK within the "medium-term".
As well as that, the manifesto promises to restore the Welsh Development Agency to promote trade and investment in Wales.
Plaid says it would:
Plaid Cymru is backing the blue route "or a variation of it" to improve the M4. It also says it will invest in improvements to the A55.
It also pledges to:
Plaid says it will "produce proposals" for the reform of the present council tax system into a domestic property tax, which the party says would be fairer for those in less expensive properties.
Partial powers on income tax are due to be devolved in the next assembly term - and Plaid is pledging not to increase it.
The party says replacing council tax would allow the scope to introduce a middle rate of income tax which will be lower than the current UK higher rate of 40%.
Plaid also promising to raise the stamp duty threshold from £125,000 to £145,000, which the manifesto says would remove "over half of all buyers out of tax altogether".
The party says it will:
Plaid Cymru say they will 're-direct' more than £1bn of the Welsh Government's £15bn budget through ending some schemes and finding savings elsewhere.
These savings include:
That cash would be used to fund the party's programme, together withplanned increased to the Welsh Government's block grant by the UK Government.
The constitution isn't devolved, but Plaid Cymru say they'd propose the establishment of a constitutional convention to put together a new framework for co-operation between the different parts of the UK.
While its vision of Wales as a "self-governing country within a confederation of equals" is a medium-term aspiration, the party says independence remains a long-term aspiration.
The manifesto says the party reserves "the right to call a referendum in Wales on the principle of a confederal UK if the UK government refuses to establish a UK-wide convention".
But it adds that, provided its confederation plans can be achieved in a "reasonable" timeframe, the party does "not plan to hold a referendum on Welsh independence in the near term".
Meanwhile the party says it would:
