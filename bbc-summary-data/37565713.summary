US election 2016: A-Z for what to look for in the second presidential debate

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The second of three US presidential debate takes place on Sunday evening, two weeks after Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump sparred for the first time.

Plenty has happened in the meantime, including the explosive release of a video that has plunged the Republican nominee into a crisis.
And there have been plenty of hints what might come up in what is likely to be another bruising encounter.
Here is our A-Z guide to what is worth keeping an eye out for.
It's the only place to start, really. A tape from 2005, that emerged on Friday, showed Mr Trump making lewd comments about women, and saying he tried to kiss and grope them. He made a videotaped apology hours later, but the backlash even from within his own party was intense. Mrs Clinton has been gifted a line of attack, so how much of the debate can we expect to focus on what Mr Trump said, and how will he respond?
Good luck listening out for these terms...
Not the pork kind, but the audio kind. Mr Trump complained of a faulty microphone after the first debate - and it turned out his complaints were justified. Organisers will be keen to show that no candidate is disadvantaged this time around.
It's what Mrs Clinton called her rival all the way through the first debate - he apparently does not like being called by his first name. So will she do the same again, or did that trick do its job?
Climate change is a subject that has been mentioned only very very briefly in the two debates so far. Will it get any hearing in the town hall format?
On one hand: Mr Trump's charitable organisation, and the fact it was banned from fundraising in his native New York this week. On the other: Mrs Clinton's, and the concerns over its links to international donors. Trump, perhaps surprisingly, did not make a point of this in the last debate: will he now?
...and the other women with whom Bill Clinton was unfaithful, or is alleged to have been. The New York Times reported last week that Mrs Clinton engineered an "aggressive strategy of counterattack" against the women in question.
It's an issue that is hurting Mrs Clinton among younger, female voters - so how would she respond to a question on this?

On a related note, Mr Trump has warned he may go for the jugular this time around. He didn't hit Mrs Clinton on some of the issues we might have expected - so will issues like Benghazi, her email scandal, the Clinton Foundation and her husband's infidelities get more of an airing?
Even the most partial of observers would agree that there were more interruptions by Mr Trump last time around (the extent to which he interrupted changes from news outlet to outlet).
Similarly, Clinton deputy Tim Kaine was king of the interruptions on Tuesday night. Will Sunday's event be more civilised?
Don't hold out for any rolling in the aisles - neither candidate is known for their comic timing - but there's plenty of material there to play with.
More to the point, the lack of one - while there were plenty of zingers during the Hoftstra University debate, neither candidate was able to deliver that crucial fact or line that buried their opponent. Take two?
Quite a few porkies were peddled last time around, so what should those in charge look out for? We asked a former FBI interrogator for his advice on weeding out the truth.
Yes, plural: there are two this time, CNN's Anderson Cooper and ABC's Martha Raddatz.
Trump was unhappy with the previous moderator, NBC's Lester Holt. There will be even more scrutiny this time around.
N is for No, That's Wrong
Just like last time around, we'll be keeping an eye on some of the statements made by both candidates. We're likely to be quite busy.

Last updated November 8, 2016
The BBC poll of polls looks at the five most recent national polls and takes the median value, ie, the value between the two figures that are higher and two figures that are lower.
Unusually, ABC and CNN have said they are ready to consider 30 of the most popular questions submitted by the public on the website Presidential Open Questions, though there is no guarantee those questions will come up.
The most popular questions on the site at the moment relate to background checks for gun sales, benefits, the Second Amendment and term limits for members of Congress and the Supreme Court.
Clinton v Trump, Round One was watched by a record 84 million people - will we see the same audience this time around, or have people already had enough?
Body language, specifically. We've taken a look at what both candidates' gestures say about them.
It's a different format to last time around: half the questions will be asked by members of the public, and half by the moderators, based, according to the independent organisers "on topics of broad public interest as reflected in social media and other sources".
Clinton saw a jump in the polls after debate number one; the Trump campaign was buoyed by the performance of Mr Trump's right-hand man Mike Pence in his debate. Could this debate present one candidate with momentum, with only one more televised event to come?
Last Tuesday saw the only vice-presidential debate between Mr Kaine and Mr Pence: the former went for the attack; the latter remained unflappable - almost the reverse of the senior candidates' performances in the first debate. Will Mr Trump be buoyed by Mr Pence's strong show?

Is the venue of the debate, in St Louis, Missouri. It all starts at 21:00 eastern time on Sunday (01:00 GMT).
(Tenuous, we know)
The New York Times reported this week that Mr Trump may not have paid federal income tax for 18 years, after posting a near-$1bn loss in 1995. The candidate said this showed he had "brilliantly" navigated the complex tax code.
If this subject doesn't come up, it will be a huge surprise.

There are now more millennials (aged 18-34) than baby boomers (aged 51-69) in the US, according to the Pew Research Center. That's a lot of potential voters. Mrs Clinton's one-time Democrat co-runner Bernie Sanders is popular with this age group, so she has a fight on her hands to lure them to her side and avoid seeing them vote for third-party or independent candidates.
The problem? The Trump campaign has picked up on an audio recording they say shows Mrs Clinton denigrating Sanders supporters. Democrats say it doesn't; listen to it and make your own minds up.
