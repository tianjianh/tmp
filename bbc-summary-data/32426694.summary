Emergency services evacuated 1,500 people from a 12 mile radius as a precaution, authorities said.
The nearby city of Puerto Montt has already been covered in a cloud of ash.
Mayor Gervoy Paredes said residents were "very, very frightened", but so far everyone is safe.
Authorities said no hot rocks or lava had been seen so far, only ash.
However, experts warned that local rivers could be flooded by melting snow and ice.
Chile has the second largest chain of volcanoes in the world after Indonesia, with about 500 that are potentially active.
It is southern Chile's second volcanic eruption in recent months.
In March, the Villarrica volcano erupted in the early hours of the morning, spewing ash and lava.
