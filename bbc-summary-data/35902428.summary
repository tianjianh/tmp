[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
League Two Player of the Month Ollie Watkins' sensational stoppage-time winner saw Exeter City come from behind to beat Devon rivals Plymouth Argyle.

After a cagey first half Jamille Matt gave Argyle the lead as he rammed in his third goal in as many games.
Exeter drew level with their first shot on target when Watkins drilled a shot into the bottom corner from 20 yards.
But he topped that effort by blasting a brilliant shot into the top corner from 25 yards out to seal the win.
The victory saw Exeter do a league double over Plymouth for the first time since the 2013-14 season.
Argyle drop out of the top three on goal difference after Bristol Rovers' comfortable 3-0 win over Crawley Town, while Exeter's hopes of making the play-offs stay alive as they move up to 10th place, two points off a spot in the top seven.
