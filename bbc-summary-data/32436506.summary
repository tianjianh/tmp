Lancashire fracking planning decision deferred again

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A decision on whether to allow fracking at two sites in Lancashire has been deferred to review additional details.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Energy firm Cuadrilla had applied to extract shale gas at its sites in Little Plumpton and Roseacre Wood, near Blackpool.
Planners had recommended rejecting the application but Cuadruilla was given more time to address noise and traffic problems in January.
Lancashire County Council has moved the deadline to 30 June.
Planning officers have been given the extension in order to review details supplied by Cuadrilla and feedback from the subsequent consultation period.
Fracking - or hydraulic fracturing - is a technique in which water and chemicals are pumped into shale rock at high pressure to extract gas.
