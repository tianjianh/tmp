You can visit our at-a-glance guide to the Labour manifesto here.
BBC Political Editor Nick Robinson has been blogging about the the importance of party manifestos and why we should take the time to read them.
Nick has also blogged about Ed Miliband's speech today. He writes: "It was one of the most powerful speeches I've seen him make.
"It was, though, the front page of the manifesto with its "Budget Responsibility Commitment" and "clear vow to protect our nation's finances" which revealed his greatest fear.
"How can he convince voters so soon after the Great Crash of 2008 to put Labour in charge of the economy again?"
Key quotes
Labour leader Ed Miliband: "I am ready, ready to put an end to the tired old idea that as long as we look after the rich and powerful we will all be OK.
"Ready to build a country that works for working people once again. Ready to put into practice the truth that it is only when working people succeed, that Britain succeeds.
"If you elect me your prime minister in just over three weeks' time, I will work for that goal. I will fight for that goal. Every single day. In everything I do. In every decision I make."
Conservative chancellor George Osborne: "Ed Miliband has failed to set out a credible economic plan today and nobody will be fooled by it.
"There were no new ideas for Britain and if you read the small print, it confirms he will run a deficit every year which means higher borrowing, more debt and higher taxes. Britain doesn't want to return to the economic chaos of the past."
Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg: "Ed Miliband's claim that Labour has no plans for additional borrowing is a bit like an alcoholic, who drinks a bottle of vodka every day, claiming they have no plans for additional vodka.
"It's a dangerous habit, it's a dangerous addiction and their plans actually involve Â£70bn of more borrowing than we know is necessary."
Shadow chancellor Ed Balls: "I can't say to Scotland that you're going to be exempt from spending cuts in the unprotected areas but they're sensible and they are absolutely in marked contrast to what the Tories are proposing."
SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon: "The truth is out about Labour spending cuts. Jim Murphy's false claims in the TV debates have been rubbished by his own party bosses at Westminster, who have hung him out to dry."
Tory chief whip Michael Gove turned up outside Labour's manifesto launch this morning with a group of people with Nicola Sturgeon masks.
