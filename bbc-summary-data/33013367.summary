[SN]TITLE[SN]
Derriford Hospital helipad to allow faster patient transfers

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Journey times for some emergency patients to hospital will be cut by 30 minutes when a new helipad becomes operational on Friday.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The facility at Derriford Hospital, the South West's designated major trauma centre, will enable Devon and Cornwall's air ambulances to land at night.
It will also be able to receive search and rescue (SAR) helicopters.
The current landing facility has been described as "not fit for purpose".
The small grassy area used for air ambulance landings is further away from the emergency department, unsuitable for larger helicopters and has no lighting.
Currently, SAR helicopters have to land at nearby Marjons, with patients then being transferred to hospital by land ambulance.
Dr Anthony Kehoe, a consultant in emergency medicine, said: "The current strip is unfit for purpose and can't be used in all conditions or at all at night.
"Certain air ambulances and search and rescue can't land here and diversion to a secondary site can add around 30 minutes, which can be critical at that time."
The Helicopter Emergency Landing Pads Appeal (HELP) has contributed Â£850,000 towards the helipad construction, with Â£900,000 coming from capital funding from the Plymouth Hospitals NHS Trust.
