The Portuguese appeared to be frustrated by the performance of referee Mike Jones during Wednesday's 0-0 draw with Hull at Old Trafford.
And Mourinho highlighted Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp's exchange with fourth official Neil Swarbrick during their 1-1 draw with Chelsea on Tuesday.
"You know clearly I am different. The rules for me are different," he said.
Klopp apologised after shouting in Swarbrick's face during the second half of Tuesday's match at Anfield, and said the official told him: "No problem, I like your passion."
Former Chelsea boss Mourinho, who had earlier walked out of a BBC TV interview, said: "Yesterday a fourth official told a manager: 'I enjoy very much your passion.' Today, I am told to sit down or I am going to be sent to the stand."
Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger is serving a four-match touchline ban after being found guilty of verbally abusing fourth official Anthony Taylor, remaining in the technical area after his dismissal and then making physical contact with Taylor during Arsenal's home win over Burnley last month.
Mourinho has served two touchline bans this season, for speaking about Taylor prior to his side's trip to Liverpool in October, and kicking a water bottle during a home draw with West Ham in November. Both actions are against Football Association rules.
The 54-year-old was given a stadium ban in November 2015 while managing Chelsea after he was found guilty of going to referee Jon Moss' dressing room during a London derby at West Ham.
His long-time assistant Rui Faria served a six-game stadium ban when he had to be pulled away from referee Mike Dean during Chelsea's game against Sunderland in April 2014.
Mourinho said: "I watch my team from the hotel. I was forbidden to go to the stadium. My assistant had six matches stadium ban. I didn't touch anyone."
Hull goalkeeper Eldin Jakupovic made a string of fine saves at Old Trafford as the Tigers frustrated United.
Mourinho said: "I don't criticise my opponent. They are fighting for their lives. Every point for them is gold. They have to fight with everything they have. They tried to see what they were allowed to do."
He told reporters at the post-match press conference: "Tell the truth. It is as simple as that. You will be doing a public service, I think. If I speak I am punished. I don't want to be punished."

In trying to avoid getting himself into trouble with the FA, Jose Mourinho may have done exactly that.
His frustration was obvious during a first half in which he had three long conversations with fourth official Stuart Attwell, then one more in the second, to express his concern at Hull's perceived time-wasting.
He evidently had no desire to speak with colleagues on Match of the Day judging by his hasty exit at the first opportunity just 90 seconds into his post-match interview.
His news conference lasted five minutes, during which time he told journalists to "write the truth" because he feared for the consequences if he said what he thought.
That is all fine.
But in stating he gets different treatment to rival managers, Mourinho may have crossed the line.
