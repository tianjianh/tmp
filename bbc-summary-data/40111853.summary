Manxman Cavendish won the road race title in 2013, while Adam Blythe will be looking to defend his crown.
Deignan will aim to win her fourth national road race title, with Olympic gold medallist Dani King challenging.
The men's and women's time trials take place on the Isle of Man on 22 June, followed by the road race on 25 June.
Cavendish has not raced since March after being diagnosed with a virus which causes glandular fever.
He is one of four Manx cyclists who will be competing on home soil including two-time double British road race champion Peter Kennaugh and Anna Christian.
Alex Dowsett will attempt a record sixth British title in the men's time trial, while Hayley Simmonds will go for her third consecutive title in the women's time trial.
Director of cycling Jonny Clay said: "The calibre of the riders who will be taking to the start line speaks volumes for both the health of road racing in Great Britain and the draw of a championships taking place in such an iconic venue which is synonymous with our sport."
