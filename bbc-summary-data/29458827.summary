Can 16-year-olds donate bone marrow?

Ethan is 17 and loves football and pizza. Oh, and he has saved the life of a child he has never met.

"You know action films where people save people's lives?" He said. "I'm not saying I'm a superhero, but an everyday person can be a superhero, you don't have to have super powers."
Ethan made history after becoming the UK's youngest bone marrow donor.
He discovered he was a match with a child who had cancer after he and his mates signed up to the Anthony Nolan donor register.
Every year 2,000 people in the UK need life-saving help from bone marrow donors, but currently there are not enough so some of them never find a "match".
Donor registers particularly want teenagers to sign up because they're more likely to be in better health.
But it's feared conflicting age limits are putting off potential donors.
Bone marrow is the tissue in large bones in the body which creates blood stem cells which fight infections, carry oxygen and stop bleeding.
Diseases like leukaemia can damage bone marrow, which needs to be replaced.
Less than a third of patients will get a tissue match with their family, so instead rely on donor registers.
If you are 16 or 17 and want to become a bone marrow donor it can be quite confusing.
One of the UK's main donor registers The Anthony Nolan Trust says you need to be 16.
The charity lowered the age from 18 following a review in 2012 which found this age group is at no more risk than an adult.
However, other registers believe you must be 18 as they think the process requires adult consent.
It means potential vital donors may be being missed.
The other main donor register in the UK, the British Bone Marrow Registry, has told Newsbeat that due to "advances in stem cell donation" it is looking at dropping its age limit to 17, which is the age you need to be to donate blood.
Seventeen-year-old Ethan Buttress made history after he became the UK's youngest bone marrow donor to help save the life of an unknown child who had cancer.
He found out he was a match after signing up to the Anthony Nolan register; two years ago he would have been too young.
"I can't put it into words. I'm only 17 and I have been able to save someone's life. It's fantastic," he said.
Anthony Nolan's Head of Register Development Ann O'Leary hopes more donor registers will consider lowering their age limits.
She said: "Each register has to have their own joining policy. We know that transplant centres prefer younger donors and we would welcome any move that would make any young donors more available for a transplant."
Once you have registered, it could take anything years before you are identified as a "match" with a patient. And you may never be called on at all.
If you are, you must undergo a thorough examination to make sure there are no medical reasons you cannot donate.
There are two types of donation:
It is important to point out that no medical procedure is risk free, but experts say 16 or 17-year-old donors are at no more risk than an adult.
