Gundogan, who joined City from Borussia Dortmund for Â£20m in June, limped off in tears in his side's 2-0 win over Watford on Wednesday.
"I'm so sad as it looks like we'll be without him for a long time," said the City boss.
He added they would not know the player's prognosis until Thursday.
Germany international Gundogan, Guardiola's first signing for his new club, arrived at City injured having dislocated his kneecap in training at the start of May.
It ruled him out of Euro 2016 and the start of the Premier League season, but he eventually made his debut at Etihad Stadium in the 4-0 win over Borussia Monchengladbach in September.
He has made 16 appearances for the club, scoring five goals.
