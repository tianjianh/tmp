[SN]TITLE[SN]
Sizewell C nuclear power station consultation starts

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
More than 5,000 people are expected to work on the construction of a nuclear power station in Suffolk at its peak.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
EDF Energy wants to build Sizewell C next to an existing plant near Leiston.
It would take nine years, with most workers housed on a new local 'campus'. EDF also wants to create two park and ride sites, intended for construction staff, near the A12.
A public consultation is being held ahead of any formal planning application.
It said the principle of building a third nuclear plant on the Suffolk coast, immediately to the north of Sizewell B, had been accepted by government.
EDF said about 25,000 'employment opportunities' would be created, with 5,600 workers on site at the peak of construction.
Up to 3,000 construction workers would be housed either on a site off the B1122 near Eastbridge or next to the Sizewell Sports and Social Club.
Angela Piearce, EDF's head of Sizewell C development, said the impact on traffic was "a big concern locally".
A park and ride site for workers approaching from the north would be at either Yoxford, Darsham or the A144 junction, while a southern site would be at Wickham Market, Woodbridge or Bredfield.
Suffolk County Council and local parish councils have called for a bypass around four villages on the A12, but EDF said that is not part of its proposals going into the consultation.
Ms Piearce added: "We are offering to build a bypass or widen the A12 at Farnham, but our initial studies show a new road around the other villages (Little Glemham, Marlesford and Stratford St Andrew) wouldn't be justified by the development."
Rail links would be improved with either a new terminal on the existing line at King George's Avenue, Leiston or a new extension to the line heading through main construction area.
A lorry park would be built on the A14 near Ipswich at either the Seven Hills junction or next to the existing Orwell Crossing Lorry Park.
EDF said it was "key" for local people to take part in the consultation and give their preferred options.
