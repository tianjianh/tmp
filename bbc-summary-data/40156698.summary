Why do we hold a minute's silence?

People across the UK are holding a minute's silence on Tuesday, for those who died in Saturday's attack in London.

The One Love concert in Manchester on Sunday night also started with a moment's silence.
This was to remember those who had lost their lives or been affected by the attack in Manchester two weeks earlier.
But why do we hold a silence to pay tribute in this way?
In the UK, the first recorded national silence was held on Armistice Day in 1919.
Armistice Day was the day that World War One ended, on 11 November 1918.
In November 1919, King George V issued a proclamation that called for a two-minute silence.
"All locomotions should cease, so that, in perfect stillness, the thoughts of everyone may be concentrated on reverent remembrance of the glorious dead," he said.
All locomotion should cease means that all movement should stop, so everybody should stand or sit still, whatever they are doing. So it was about more than just not talking.
Since 1919, on the second Sunday of November (otherwise known as Remembrance Sunday), a two-minute silence is held at 11am at war memorials, cenotaphs, religious services and shopping centres throughout the country to remember all those killed in conflicts.
While holding a period of silence remains the traditional way to pay tribute and show respect, in some cases where it is appropriate, a round of applause is used to celebrate somebody's life - for example, to remember sports stars who have passed away.
Sports writer Richard Williams explains that Italian people have been doing this for a while.
"I think it's a good idea when the person is someone whose achievements were accompanied by the cheers of vast crowds," he says.
