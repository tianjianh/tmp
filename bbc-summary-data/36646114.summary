Head coach Grant Bradburn names 10 of the Scotland squad who played at the ICC World Twenty20, where Afghanistan beat the Scots in the pool stage.
"Every chance to play higher ranked opposition presents a great opportunity for Scotland," Bradburn said.
"We look forward to taking on Afghanistan at The Grange."
"After a lean period of national fixtures, the squad are looking forward to coming together for the first time since the ICC World T20.
"Despite some local and County players being unavailable for consideration for this series, we have brought together a very strong exciting side on the back of impressive individual performances in domestic, Regional and County Cricket."
