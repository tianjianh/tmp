The double shooting at a youth project in Clonsilla was reportedly carried out by a man who was dressed as a woman.
GardaÃ­ (Irish police) were called to the scene on Shelerin Road shortly after 18:00 local time on Friday.
A 32-year-old man was arrested in County Meath on Saturday morning and taken to Blanchardstown Garda station.
Irish broadcaster RTÃ‰ has reported that the 36-year-old who died after the attack "may not have been the intended target".
He was father-of-two Keith Walker from Tir Na Ri Road in Clondalkin in Dublin.
The second victim, who was shot in the arm, is being treated in Connolly Hospital, Blanchardstown, for non-life threatening injuries.
It is understood the men were members of a pigeon club who were meeting in a yard.
