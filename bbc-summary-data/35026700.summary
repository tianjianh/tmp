Youngs, 26, in his 10th season of senior rugby with the club, played in three of England four World Cup games.
Uncapped lock Slater, 27, has played 101 games for the Tigers since 2010.
Burns, who made 28 appearances last season following his arrival from Gloucester, has yet to feature in 2015-16 after suffering a fractured jaw.
The 25-year-old has been capped five times by England, but has not played for his country since 2014.
"When I first came to Tigers last summer, I always thought of it as a long-term move for me," said Burns.
