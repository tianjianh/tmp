Dundee 1-1 Inverness CT

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Kane Hemmings' late strike for Dundee denied Inverness Caledonian Thistle their first league win of the season.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Iain Vigurs pulled a simple chance wide of the Dundee goal in the first half.
Home goalkeeper Scott Bain saved a Ross Draper drive but was helpless when David Raven rounded off an Inverness break after an hour of play.
Inverness keeper Owain Fon Williams saved a Greg Stewart penalty before Hemmings struck and Inverness forward Andrea Mbuyi-Mutombo was sent off.
The visitors have struggled to find the net this season, with only three goals prior to kick-off, and Mutombo passed up a glorious chance to increase their tally.
Inverness captain David Raven swung in a cross from the right but the Belgium-born midfielder headed the ball wide of the target from just eight yards.
Vigurs played a wonderful one-two with Raven but with the goal gaping the 27-year-old blasted the ball wide of goal.
The home side had plenty of possession with Hemmings and Stewart looking lively but they lacked a cutting edge in front of goal.
Caley took the lead through Raven when the home defence stood off and allowed him time to curl the ball into the corner beyond Scott Bain.
Nicky Low had a chance to equalise when he intercepted a Carl Tremarco pass-back but was forced wide by Fon-Williams.
With seven minutes left the home side were awarded a penalty when Danny Devine handled a cross into the box.
Stewart stepped up but his left-foot shot was brilliantly saved by the visiting keeper.
Paul Hartley's side kept pushing forward and, after Paul McGowan missed a glorious chance at the back post, Hemmings slid the ball home.
The drama, though, was not over and referee Andrew Dallas sent off Mutombo for a challenge on Nick Ross.
