More than 100 items celebrating the life of Oscar-winning actress Vivien Leigh have gone on display at the home of her favourite costume designer.

"Vivien Leigh: Public Faces, Private Lives" includes pieces by set and costume designer Oliver Messel.
The exhibition is being held at the National Trust-owned Nymans property in West Sussex, until 4 September.
It features outfits, photos and scripts on loan from the Victoria and Albert (V&A) Museum in London.
It acquired the archive from the Gone with the Wind star's grandchildren in 2013.
It covers all aspects of Leigh's life and career, as detailed in diaries she started writing when she was 16-years-old in 1929 and kept until her death in 1967.
