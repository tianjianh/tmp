Slimani had already been taken off but referee Wayne Barnes allowed him to return after France's team doctor said Atonio needed a head injury assessment.
Slimani's return coincided with a series of scrums on the Wales line, and France finally won in the 100th minute.
The tournament's Untoward Incident Review Group is to review the matter.
Feature: Was this match the day rugby lost its head?
Organisers said: "Six Nations Rugby will send the file to the UIRG [review group] later this week and it is anticipated that the review process will begin shortly thereafter."
After the defeat, Wales interim head coach Rob Howley said: "There is evidence to suggest the integrity of the game has been brought into disrepute."
Following a chaotic and controversial finish to the game, Wales wing George North claimed he was bitten by an opponent, but citing commissioner John Montgomery said available video footage was inconclusive and no action was taken.
France forward Yoann Maestri was also fined 30,000 euros (Â£26,000) after accepting a misconduct charge for critical comments he made to the media about Barnes after the game.
