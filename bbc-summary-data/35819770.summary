A busy Hull city centre road has been closed while a pub doubles as a well-known London landmark for a TV drama.

Scenes of National Treasure, starring Robbie Coltrane and Julie Walters, are being filmed on Lowgate, with the Three John Scotts pub serving as a substitute for the Old Bailey.
The four-part Channel 4 drama looks at the impact of accusations of historical sexual offences against a celebrity.
The road is due to be shut from 10:00 GMT until 17:00.
Diversions have been put in place via Silver Street and High Street.
The Central Criminal Court of England and Wales, known as the Old Bailey, often deals with the most serious criminal cases in the capital.
