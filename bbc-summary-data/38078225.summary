Scottish airline Loganair has announced a new schedule of flights to and from Stornoway and Benbecula for next year.

It includes the introduction of a larger aircraft on Stornoway to Glasgow flights and on weekend Benbecula to Glasgow flights.
Loganair is also to offer new "convenient" links from Stornoway to Manchester.
It has described the schedule as "a statement of intent" as it prepares to operate under its own brand.
Earlier this week it emerged that Glasgow-based Loganair will stop flying under the Flybe brand from 31 August next year.
Flybe said its decision to end the franchise agreement followed "a failure to agree future operational standards and commercial arrangements".
Loganair said the move would allow the airline to "spread its wings again" and introduce "a bold new corporate identity".
Its new schedule includes using a 50-seater Saab 2000 aircraft on three of the four weekday services between Glasgow and Stornoway from 27 March.
The larger aircraft is also to be operated on a regular basis on Saturday and Sunday flights between Benbecula and Glasgow.
The new-look Manchester flights will depart twice each weekday in either direction, with additional services on Sundays.
Loganair said the service would involve a short stop at Glasgow or Inverness en route to Manchester.
The airline said next year would also see it introduce a non-stop twice-weekly service linking Glasgow and the Norwegian city of Bergen from 5 May to 25 September.
Another new route, which will be operated from 26 May to 3 September, will link Shetland and Aberdeen with Vagar in Faroe Islands.
Loganair managing director Jonathan Hinkles said: ""Our summer schedule is a statement of intent as we announce our transition from the Flybe franchise arrangements to become an independent operator from 1 September 2017.
"As Scotland's airline, Loganair is strengthening its network and adding more seats and more flights than ever before."
