He said nothing would change before the poll, but "alternative options" for the Betsi Cadwaladr health board might be looked at in the future.
Mr Jones said there was an issue over whether "one single board is the way forward for the whole of the north".
The board has been put under special measures by the Welsh government.
During First Minister's Questions on Tuesday, Mr Jones told AMs: "There are no plans to change anything before the election, I can say that.
"But there is an issue with regard to whether one single board is the way forward for the whole of the north, or whether alternative options should be looked at.
"Those issues will need to be explored in the future."
Earlier, it emerged that the health board is still paying the Â£200,000 salary of suspended chief executive Trevor Purt while he works in England.
Welsh Conservative leader Andrew RT Davies said the public needed "clarity" over Labour's plans, following what he called an "off-the-cuff" announcement.
"It's not good enough for Carwyn to dismiss this as an issue to be looked at in the future," he said.
"Given Labour's record, their plans must be put to the people of north Wales ahead of the Welsh general election next year."
