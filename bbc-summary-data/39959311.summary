Steven Daniel, also known as Bonzo, was in his dark blue Skoda Octavia when two cars pursued him at speed, causing him to stop. He was then attacked.
Police are treating the incident, which happened at about 00:10 on Craighall Road in Glasgow, as attempted murder.
The victim is thought to be a nephew of gangland figure Jamie Daniel, who died last year after a battle with cancer.
The incident was initially reported as a shooting but police later issued a clarification.
In the past 18 months, there has been a spate of attacks in the city, which detectives believe may, in some cases, be connected to the rivalry between the two notorious crime families, the Daniels and the Lyons.
Police said following the incident in the city's Port Dundas area, the two cars made off in an easterly direction.
Emergency services attended and Mr Daniel was taken by ambulance to hospital, where his condition was described as stable.
Craighall Road at the slip road to the M8 remained closed while police carried out forensic examinations.
Forensic experts are examining two cars which were found shortly after the incident. Both had been set on fire.
A black Audi vehicle was found in Forge Street, Germiston, and a silver Volkswagen vehicle was recovered in Balmuildy Road, Bishopbriggs.
Det Ch Insp John Kennedy said it appeared to have been a targeted attack.
He said: "I appreciate that people will automatically want to link this to other incidents in the past few months but, until I know more, I am unable to confirm that is the case."
He appealed to family members who knew who was responsible to "do the right thing" and contact the police.
"There are brothers, sisters, parents and other family members who know exactly what is going on and who is behind it," he said.
"This victim appears to have been targeted but he's also someone's son."
Det Ch Insp Kennedy also urged members of the public to contact them if they saw the Skoda being pursued, or saw anyone acting suspiciously near the area around the time of the incident.
Some sources believe that Jamie Daniel's death ended an uneasy truce between the the Daniel and Lyons families.
In September 2015, Ross Sherlock was shot near a primary school in Bishopbriggs.
He survived and two men are due to stand trial accused of attempted murder next month.
In November last year, Euan Johnston was shot while sitting in his car at traffic lights in Glasgow's Kinning Park. He was taken to hospital but did not survive.
The 26-year-old was due to stand trial over allegations of organised crime and supplying heroin. Police are still looking for the hitmen behind the killing.
In January, Ross Monaghan was targeted by a gunman as he dropped off his daughter at a primary school in Glasgow. He received injuries to his back and was taken to hospital.
A man has been charged with attempted murder in connection with that incident.
In March this year, Robert Daniel who is understood to be Steven Daniel's cousin, was shot outside his home in Stepps after returning from a family party.
The investigation is continuing with police yet to make any arrests.
Later that month, Ross Craig was shot in broad daylight outside his home in Shawlands.
CCTV was released of the suspect and the investigation into the shooting is continuing.
