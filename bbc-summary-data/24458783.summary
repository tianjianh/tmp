If you've ever wondered what an iCamera might look like, a Jony Ive-designed Leica  might offer a few hints.

Apple's feted design chief teamed up with industrial designer Marc Newson to create the device as a bespoke item for a charity auction.
While some may want to see it go into wider production, the amount of work that went into it means that the price would be out of reach for most.
It is expected to fetch between $500,000 (Â£312,000) and $750,000.
The special edition Leica M camera features an anodised aluminium case with tens of thousands of individual perforations.
The camera took 85 days and more than 735 hours to manufacture.
During that time more than 550 models and 1,000 prototype parts were made and tested; 55 engineers worked on the process.
As for the specifications under the bonnet, it is similar to the standard $7,000 Leica and features a 24-megapixel full-frame CMOS sensor and comes with a 50mm f/2 aperture lens.
The RED charity, founded by U2's Bono, will host the auction in New York on November 23. All proceeds will go to the Global Fund to fight Aids, Tuberculosis and Malaria.
Other items to be auctioned include a grand piano picked by the two designers, gold Apple earbuds and a cosmonaut suit.
