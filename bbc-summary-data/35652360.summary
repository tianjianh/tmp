The Hove-based club's operating income rose to £5.84m but investment in the professional cricket budget rose.
A £607,000 overall deficit is up from a loss of £418,000 the year before.
"The results are disappointing but there are some encouraging signs and grounds for optimism," Sussex chairman Jim May told BBC Sussex.
The figures follow a year in which Sussex were relegated from Division One of the County Championship, reached the quarter-finals of the T20 Blast and finished bottom of their group in the One-Day Cup.
"We've seen a significant increase in our cricket budget over the last four years which hasn't been matched in the annual income from the England and Wales Cricket Board," said May.
"The other aspects of the club are working hard and we need to bridge that gap.
"We have got an attractive side so hope to get more crowds to watch us. We have some new business units at the ground which will give us rental income all year around."
