The Journeys Festival International features work of refugees and explores their experiences.
Maria Alyokhina is making her theatre debut in Burning Doors, a production by Belarus Free Theatre.
The city will also host pop-up theatre, workshops and giant artworks displayed on buildings during the 12-day event.
Burning Doors explores the persecution of artist Petr Pavlensky, and Maria Alyokhina who was jailed following Pussy Riot's performance in a Moscow cathedral in 2012.
Director of ArtReach David Hill said he hoped the festival "will be opening eyes, challenging perceptions and raising questions through great art".
Other festival events include the UK premiere of Sanctuary and Sustenance at Portsmouth Cathedral which involves projections of photography, film and music.
It traces the journey of a family from the catastrophic events that displaced them and through their journey in search of sanctuary.
Look Up is a large-scale outdoor exhibition on the exteriors of buildings featuring the work of Nikos Papadoploulos, whose Plasticobilism series uses Playmobil figures to comment on refugee issues.
The Journeys Festival International runs from 10 to 22 October.
