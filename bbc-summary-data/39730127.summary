Ex-Papworth and Addenbrooke's nurse struck off for 'dishonesty'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A nurse who "deliberately concealed" the reasons for a previous dismissal when applying for a hospital job has been struck off.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Sally Smith claimed she was dismissed by Papworth Hospital in 2014 after fracturing her foot.
Addenbrooke's Hospital, which gave her a job, later learned she was actually sacked over competency concerns.
Ms Smith, who admitted dishonesty, was banned from practising by the Nursing and Midifery Council (NMC) On Tuesday.

After she was dismissed by Papworth, Ms Smith was also placed on a conditions of practice order by the NMC. One of the conditions was that she had to disclose that conditions had been imposed on the way she worked.
However the NMC conduct panel heard Ms Smith had "deliberately concealed the details" of this order because she feared she would not "secure a role if you were honest".
She was taken on as a staff nurse at Addenbrooke's in April 2016 but was suspended three months later after telling her line manager she was the subject of a conditions of practice order.
Ms Smith, who had also failed to disclose her past when seeking agency work, told the conduct panel she "accepted" she "had been dishonest in respect of all the charges".
