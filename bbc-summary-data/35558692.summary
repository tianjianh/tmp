The 22-year-old former Bristol City trainee has scored four goals in 29 appearances for Gareth Ainsworth's Chairboys this campaign.
He joins a Latics side currently 23rd in League One.
"Aaron's been unhappy of late because he hasn't been able to force his way into the team, so this move is best for all parties," said Ainsworth.
