The pram was knocked over at about 14:00 on Tuesday, at Riccarton Mains Road, at the junction with Bryce Road.
The seven-month-old baby boy was checked over at the Royal Hospital for Sick Children but found to be uninjured.
Police said they are looking for a young man who was driving an "older style" white Ford Fiesta.
The driver did not stop and turned his vehicle around before travelling North along Riccarton Mains Road towards the A71 Calder Road.
The driver was white, in his early to mid 20s with short dark hair.
Insp Liz Duthie, of Police Scotland, said: "It is extremely fortunate the young baby did not suffer injury as a result of this collision, but his mother was left extremely distraught.
"We are eager to trace the motorist who did not stop and anyone with information that can help identify him is asked to contact police immediately."
