[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Oxford United have signed defender Fiacre Kelleher on a two-year deal from Scottish champions Celtic.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Kelleher, 21, joins the U's despite head coach Michael Appleton set to join Leicester City as assistant manager.
"I came here for the club and, whether he stays or goes, I think the club will still be run brilliantly," Kelleher told BBC Radio Oxford.
"It was a big deal to move from a club I'd been at since 16, but something I needed to do to progress my career."
Kelleher failed to play a senior game for Celtic, but made 25 appearances on loan at Scottish League One side Peterhead last season.
"The interest (from Oxford) came a couple of weeks ago," he added. "When a deal was done, I was really happy to come to the club."
