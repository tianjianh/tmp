Ramp access to Backwell and Nailsea station postponed

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Plans to build disabled access ramps at Nailsea and Backwell railway station have been postponed after a deadline to start work was missed.

Ramps were due to have been installed this year after Â£1m of government funding was made available to First Great Western (FGW) in 2011.
But the grant was withdrawn after the company missed a deadline to claim it because of a series of delays.
The move has been criticised by a disability group.
An FGW spokesman said the ramp installation was not able to begin on time because Network Rail needed to carry out work on an embankment and a platform, and North Somerset Council had to complete work on a car park before it could take place.
FGW was given money to install ramps by the Department for Transport as part of its Access For All scheme, but it needed to be used by March 2014.
Dan Panes from FGW said a fresh bid for money had been unsuccessful.
"We were pretty sure it would happen.... But there were other schemes that got the nod before this one."
"Other work came up around the station that meant we couldn't do the work. We had no option but to postpone it."
Alison Morgan, from the Backwell Access Group, said: "We've now got a lovely level car park with nice new disabled parking bays, but we cant use them because we can't get on the trains."
Mr Panes said FGW was looking to secure funding from another source.
