Ross County striker Alex Schalk has agreed a contract extension to stay at the club until the end of next season.

Schalk, 24, follows Ryan Dow and Craig Curran, who have also agreed new deals.
"We've been in negotiations for a while and we're delighted Alex sees his future here," County boss Jim McIntyre told BBC Scotland.
"He's an important player. He suffered a knee injury early in the season which limited his contribution but his goals-to-starts ratio is very high."
The Dutch striker has scored 17 goals in his two seasons at County, including the last-minute winner against Hibernian which won County the Scottish League Cup last season.
"He's a natural goal-scorer and a different type to Curran and Liam Boyce," McIntyre added.
"It's very important we tie down key members of the squad, which we've managed to do over the last couple of weeks.
"We're looking to extend two or three more and looking to build for the future."
