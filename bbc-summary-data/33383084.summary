A Fife businessman is facing a jail sentence after being convicted of abusing a primary school girl.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Shamas Ali, 47, forced the youngster to massage him and touch his legs before carrying out sex acts.
Ali had denied the indecency offence committed at houses in Dunfermline but was found guilty by a majority verdict at the High Court in Edinburgh.
He was found guilty of abusing the girl when she was aged between seven and 11, up to August 2003.
The victim, now aged 22, gave evidence against Ali, who is from Dunfermline.
Defence solicitor advocate John Scott QC asked that Ali's bail be continued after the verdict.
He said Ali had no criminal record of any significance and no breaches of bail.
Mr Scott said: "Whilst a custodial sentence is all but inevitable, there is no reason to think he would fail to comply with bail conditions."
The judge told Ali: "You have been convicted of a serious sexual offence."
Lady Wise said she was prepared to continue his bail while a background report was prepared ahead of sentencing next month.
But she told Ali: "You should not be under any illusion that says anything about the ultimate disposal."
Ali was placed on the sex offenders' register.
