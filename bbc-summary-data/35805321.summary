The two teams drew 0-0 in the Netherlands three weeks ago but Atletico have since won four La Liga games in a row.
"We've found a regularity and a more stable way of playing," said Simeone.
"What's important is that the goals come from different parts of the field."
Atletico, second in La Liga, eight points behind leaders Barcelona with nine games remaining, start as favourites to advance to the quarter-finals for the third successive season.
They will be without defender Stefan Savic (thigh) and midfielder Tiago Mendes (leg) is out.
Dutch champions PSV will be without Uruguay Under-20 forward Gaston Pereiro, who is suspended.
Phillip Cocu's side, held to a 1-1 home draw by Heerenveen on Saturday, have a one-point lead at the top of their domestic table.
