The wicketkeeper collapsed while batting against Free State in a Cricket South Africa match on 15 November.
He scored more than 8,000 runs in 200 matches for Namibia in all formats.
Cricket Namibia president Richard Frankle said in a statement on the ICC website: "Raymond was a tremendous asset to the national team."
Van Schoor, who made his national team debut aged 17 in 2007, played in this summer's International Cricket Council World Twenty20 Qualifier in Scotland and Ireland, and in an ICC Intercontinental Cup match against Ireland in Windhoek last month.
He captained Namibia 40 times and was his country's cricketer of the year in 2012.
