The 35-year-old, who joined the Cobblers in 2016 and made 49 starts, has signed a one-year contract.
"I'm excited by the project of trying to get the team promoted back into League One," said Taylor.
"There seems to be already a togetherness within the group of players and they seem to be doing really well, so I'm really excited."
Northampton manager Justin Edinburgh said: "We fully understand Matt's wish to play regular first-team football and it's not something we could guarantee.
"He is a first class professional and we wish him well at his new club."
