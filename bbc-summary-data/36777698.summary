[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Wigan Warriors head coach Shaun Wane has confirmed back-row forward Joel Tomkins will miss the rest of the season with injuries to both knees.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 29-year-old has missed the last two games to have the problem scanned but is now out for the rest of 2016.
Tomkins, a dual-code England international, scored one try in his 10 appearances this season.
Meanwhile, Wigan captain Sean O'Loughlin will serve a one-match ban for a high tackle against Wakefield.
O'Loughlin had been charged for Grade C offence - that usually carries a guideline two to three game suspension - for the tackle on Wakefield's Chris Annakin but his penalty was reduced to one game and a Â£300 fine after he submitted an early guilty plea.
"The independent tribunal took into consideration O'Loughlin's first half dismissal, guilty plea and long professional career having not previously appeared before the disciplinary tribunal," the Rugby Football League statement reads.
