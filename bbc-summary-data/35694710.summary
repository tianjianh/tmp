The ride, which has been closed since the accident, is to reopen on 19 March when the Staffordshire theme park reopens for its new season.
The owner of the attraction is to be prosecuted over the crash.
Merlin Attractions Operation Ltd will appear at North Staffordshire Justice Centre on 22 April, the Health and Safety Executive announced last week.
