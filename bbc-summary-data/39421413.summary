Dan Biggar: Lions selection not motivation in Ospreys' 'worst-case scenario'

Impressing British and Irish Lions selectors will not be Dan Biggar's motivation when Ospreys play Stade Francais in the European Challenge Cup quarter-final at Principality Stadium.

The fly-half says helping the Swansea region triumph after being handed a "worst-case scenario" is his aim.
The match has had to be moved from their Liberty Stadium home because of a clash of fixtures with Swansea City.
"I'll be worried about making sure we come out on the winning side," he said.
Lions coach Warren Gatland has said this weekend's round of European knockout matches is a chance for players to impress before the squad is announced on 19 April.
Asked about his chances, Wales stand-off Biggar replied: "Knowing Gats he's got a good idea of the squad already and it's nice to be able to stake a claim if selected at the weekend.
"But for me ... the last thing you're worrying about in the middle of a game or if you've got a kick to touch is 'I've got to make an extra 10 metres here to impress the selectors'.
"It's about making an extra 10 metres for your team to be in a better position.
"For me I just take it each day as it comes.
"If it happens it would be a lovely, lovely way to finish off the season.
"I'm not holding out too much hope in terms of not thinking about it really. I'd love to be in the reckoning, being talked about, but as far as my attitude is you can't do an awful lot more about that."
Ospreys are in the Challenge Cup for the first time after missing out on qualification for the top-tier Champions' Cup.
Despite a perfect group campaign where they picked up a maximum 30 points, Ospreys find themselves playing on a neutral venue against one of the most powerful sides left in the tournament.
Stade Francais also go into the game off the back of an aborted amalgamation with Racing 92 which led to a player strike and appears to have had a galvanising effect on their form.
They beat former European champions Toulon 17-11 in the French Top 14 last time out.
"There was potentially livelihoods on the line and they are a proud rugby club and they are going to be hugely motivated in terms of recent events," said Biggar.
"It's probably worked out as worst-case scenario for us in terms of 30 points from 30 points in the group, [but] we've had to move the game from our home ground and we're up against one of the strongest teams left in the competition so we've certainly got to do it the hard way.
"Their home form has been exceptional this year, their away form - I don't think they've won on the road yet and we're hoping to keep it that way and if we perform well we give ourselves a chance."
