More on the fatal crash and other stories from Cornwall
A crowd funding page set up by a Hopes family friend has so far raised more than Â£13,000.
A tribute said Mrs Hopes was a "loving, kind and devoted mum" and her husband Lee and family were devastated by the loss of her and Alfie, who were "loved deeply".
Alfie was described as "happy and popular boy" and a keen footballer, playing for Saltash United where his father was the coach.
"He loved Liverpool Football Club and was rarely seen without a football kit on and a ball at his feet," the tribute said.
The family said Tommy remains in the Intensive Care Unit at Bristol Children's Hospital with his family at his side, but is expected to make a full recovery "over time".
It also thanked the "incredible" emergency services and everyone who tried to help at the scene.
Mr Woodman's family also paid tribute to him, describing him as a loving and caring son, an amazing brother and "awesome" dad and granddad, who would be "deeply missed" by everyone who knew him.
Devon and Cornwall Police are appealing for any witnesses to the collision to contact them.
