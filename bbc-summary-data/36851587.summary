The League Two newcomers fell behind on 27 minutes when Joshua Mullin headed in a free-kick from Nicky Cadden.
Mullin then provided a neat cross for Daniel Mullen to knock in right on the stroke of half time.
Mikey Miller crashed a shot against the woodwork as the visitors from League One continued to dominate before Liam Buchanan made it 3-0 from close range.
Ousman See went close for the hosts but was denied a landmark goal by a smart save from Liam Kelly.
Livingston move up to second place in Group G, behind St Mirren, who have two wins from two.
