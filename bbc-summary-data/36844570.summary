In a statement, the Premier League, English Football League and Football Association said poor conduct has reached "unacceptable levels".
Starting this season, red cards will be issued to players who confront match officials and use offensive language or make gestures towards them.
Behaviour within the technical areas will also be more rigorously enforced.
Not one player has been sent off in the Premier League for insulting or abusive language towards a match official in the past five seasons.
But Premier League chairman Richard Scudamore said there has been concern "for some time" that players have been "overstepping the mark".
"It is our collective position that these types of behaviour should no longer be tolerated," he added.
"Things happen in the heat of the moment during fast and highly competitive football. We still want to see the passion fans enjoy and demand, but players and managers have to be aware there are lines that should not be crossed."
