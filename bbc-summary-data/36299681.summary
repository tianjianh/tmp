The 84m-long plane, which weighs 175 tonnes without cargo or fuel, was transporting a 117-tonne generator.
Traffic blocked roads on Sunday as crowds gathered to watch the plane's arrival.
The plane picked up its cargo in Prague and stopped at locations in the Middle East and Asia on its way to Australia.
Who needs an 84m-long aircraft?
