Brighton council top for tackling homophobic school bullying

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The top local authority in the country for tackling homophobic bullying in schools has been named as Brighton and Hove City Council.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Pressure group Stonewall put the authority in first place in its 2014 Education Equality Index.
It also praised the council's work with local charity the Allsorts Youth Project.
The charity delivers anti-homophobic bullying sessions in secondary and primary schools.
Richard Chamberlain is the assistant head teacher at Blatchington Mill School, which was also praised by Stonewall for its student equality conference earlier this year.
"We've done a huge amount of work in school and I know other schools across the authority are doing this work as well supported by Allsorts and Stonewall.
"It's just really great to get that recognition."
