Swansea City are planning to revisit expanding the Liberty Stadium following their American takeover.

The 21,000-capacity ground, who Swansea share with Ospreys rugby region, is the second smallest in the Premier League behind Bournemouth's Vitality Stadium.
Swansea had considered adding 12,000 seats but shelved expansion plans in December 2015 as talks to buy the ground from Swansea council stalled.
"We have to make sure the council are on board," said chairman Huw Jenkins.
Jason Levien and Steve Kaplan, experienced in running US sports teams, lead an American consortium which has bought a controlling stake of 68% in the Swans.
Swansea have averaged crowds of around 20,500 in their last four Premier League seasons, which is close to their capacity, and the club has an ultimate vision of expanding the Liberty Stadium to 40,000 seats.
The Welsh club's new major shareholders want to talk to the local council about purchasing the Liberty Stadium and Swansea's initial desire is to expand the ground to 33,000.
"All Swansea supporters would like to see the stadium expanded," added Jenkins.
"If we can find a deal that suits both parties and, perhaps with Jason and Steve on board, if we feel it is right to go down that route again we'll meet up and find a solution that helps everybody."
