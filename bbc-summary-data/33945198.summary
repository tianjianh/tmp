"I passed well," Murray, 28, said. "I came up with some good passing shots and that was the difference."
The first four games went with serve before Murray gained the opening break in game five courtesy of a fierce forehand up the line.
World number 24 Tsonga had two break points in game four of the second set, but passed up the first before Murray's first ace of the match took the game to deuce.
From there, the two-time Grand Slam-title winner held, before seizing the initiative with a lob to break Tsonga's serve on his way to taking the second set.
Should Murray reach the final in Montreal he will replace Swiss Roger Federer as number two in the world rankings. He last held the position - the highest of his career - in 2013.
