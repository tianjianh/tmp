Marquinhos, who has signed a five-year deal, joined Roma from Corinthians a year ago for £3.9m, although the Brazilians will now earn another £2.3m.
PSG president Nasser Al-Khelaifi said: "It underlines the club's desire to look towards the future to construct one of Europe's biggest clubs."
Earlier this month, PSG paid Napoli £55m for Uruuay striker Edinson Cavani.
Marquinhos, whose full name is Marcos Aoas Correa, made a huge impact in his debut season in Serie A and was linked with moves to Manchester United and Barcelona.
"I am delighted to be joining Paris St-Germain, a club where so many Brazilians have played and helped write the club's history," he said.
