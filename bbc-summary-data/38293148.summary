Mr Costello, who started playing rugby league at the age of six and signed professionally in 2015, suffered the brain injury after being tackled by Salford's Adam Jones and Aaron Moore.
The inquest was told the tackle was not malicious.
Mr Jones described his tackle as "perfectly good", but said he had considered giving up rugby after the "extremely traumatic" incident.
The inquest heard Mr Costello had the ball and appeared to "slip or stumble" as he was tackled before his head or chin came into contact with Mr Jones's shoulder, causing him to fall backwards.
The back of his head hit the ground and he lost consciousness and began fitting.
After medical treatment on the  Huddersfield's Dram Centre pitch, Mr Costello was airlifted to Leeds General Infirmary for brain surgery but was pronounced dead on 14 June.
A police investigation found the death was not suspicious.
Ronan's father, Martin, said he did not hold Salford players responsible for "a tragic accident".
A statement on behalf of the family added: "He loved playing rugby league and was proud to play for Huddersfield Giants."
