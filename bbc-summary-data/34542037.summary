Three new regular passenger flights to major European destinations have been confirmed at Edinburgh Airport.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Vueling will operate direct flights three times a week from Scotland's capital to Rome Fiumicino, Paris Orly and Alicante.
Fiumicino and Orly are new routes for Edinburgh Airport, with Vueling flying to both from 29 March next year.
Its flights to Alicante will start from 16 June next year.
Gordon Dewar, chief executive of Edinburgh Airport, said: "It is tremendous that we have two new routes to Rome and Paris and we have increased our service to Alicante - this offers our passengers even greater choice and is further confirmation of Edinburgh Airport's position as a key driver for Scotland's economy.
"This commitment from Vueling, a strong European airline, shows that we've listened to our passengers and recognise the need for greater choice and European connectivity, this expansion in service is good news for business and leisure travellers, for Edinburgh and for Scotland as a whole.
"With over one million passengers through the doors at Edinburgh Airport last month - and in every one of the last five months - we are continuing to grow, create jobs and make a positive contribution for Scotland's economy."
