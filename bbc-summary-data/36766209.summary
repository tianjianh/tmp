Brandon-Lee and Tony-Lee Thulsie and two others were arrested in Johannesburg following police raids over the weekend.
They are said to have been planning to join so-called Islamic State in Syria.
In June, the US embassy in South Africa warned that US citizens in the country could be attacked by terrorist groups.

Places where Americans congregate "such as upscale shopping areas and malls in Johannesburg and Cape Town" were thought to be possible targets, the statement said.
The 23-year-old brothers appeared briefly in court, initially covering their heads with hooded jackets, local reports say.
They will remain in custody until 19 July when they can apply for bail.
The brothers were arrested after the Hawks, an elite police unit, raided two houses where they confiscated a number of items including computers and mobile phones.
According to the provisional charge sheet, the two conspired to commit terrorist acts in Johannesburg.
The Hawks believe they may be part of a terror cell in the country.
