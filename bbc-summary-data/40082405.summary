Barcelona: Ernesto Valverde set to replace Luis Enrique as coach of La Liga giants

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Barcelona are expected to name former Athletic Bilbao boss Ernesto Valverde as their new head coach on Monday.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Former Barca forward Valverde announced last week that he was leaving Athletic after four years in charge.
The 53-year-old will replace Luis Enrique, who revealed in March that he would leave the club at the end of his three-year contract.
Barcelona gave Enrique a winning send-off as they beat Alaves 3-1 to win the Copa del Rey on Saturday.
The club will hold a board meeting at 13:00 BST on Monday before President Josep Maria Bartomeu speaks to the media at 18:00 BST.
Valverde spent two seasons at Barcelona as a player from 1988-1990, scoring eight goals in 22 matches.
The Spaniard lead Athletic Bilbao to seventh place in La Liga this season, while Barcelona finished second behind Real Madrid.
