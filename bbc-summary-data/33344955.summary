Orkla is the first food manufacturer to announce a deal with US company Liquiglide to use its non-stick coating in product packaging.
Getting the last bit of sauce out of a bottle is a common annoyance for shoppers. Many have shared their frustration on social media.
One expert told the BBC some consumers might have safety concerns.
"I'm sure consumers do, from time to time, look at the wasted dregs stuck in a bottle of mayo and wonder why suppliers haven't been able to solve the issue," said Vince Bamford, buying and supplying editor for The Grocer.
"Embracing this technology would offer a brand a unique selling point, although some degree of education would be required to reassure shoppers that this was a natural product."
Liquiglide says its coating is "completely harmless" and meets safety standards because it "can be made entirely from food".
The company was founded in 2012 to sell licences for a non-stick technology developed at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
A customised version of the coating is created for each product, resulting in a "permanently wet" surface inside containers that helps the product slip out.
In March, the company reached a deal with US glue brand Elmer's to use the technology in its products.
It told the BBC it was working with 30 companies, including some of the biggest consumer brands in the US.
Orkla's food division generated more than 3bn krone (Â£246m) of sales in its last quarter.
The company said it was still deciding exactly how it would use the technology in its products.
Mr Bamford: "Non-stick packaging could look good in a TV ad, but I have my doubts that it would be enough to sway a shopper from a preferred or cheaper brand."
While reducing wasted product may benefit consumers, Liquiglide suggests it could also encourage shoppers to buy more frequently.
The company states on its website: "Liquiglide makes dispensing product so easy that consumers actually tend to use it faster... it pushes consumers to an earlier repurchase point."
