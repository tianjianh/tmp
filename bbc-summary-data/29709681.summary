Mary Boyle went missing on 18 March 1977 while visiting her grandparents at Cashelard, Ballyshannon.
The 64-year-old man is being questioned by police in Mullingar, County Westmeath.
A fresh review of what is the Republic of Ireland's longest running missing persons case began in 2011.
Police said it was a significant ongoing investigation that has involved interviewing a wide range of people and undertaking a number of searches aided by forensic and geology experts.
A police family liaison officer has been keeping Mary's mother Ann informed about developments in the case.
Assistant Commissioner Northern Region Kieran Kenny said: "We are appealing for anyone with any information on the circumstances around Mary's disappearance to contact us.
"Even something that people may have thought was insignificant at the time could help us advance the continuing investigation."
Mr Kenny said new evidence, which emerged following the most recent review of the case, led to the arrest.
