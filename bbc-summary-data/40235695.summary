Parry, 35, threw two Commonwealth Games A standards with efforts of 65.25m and 65.32m to put her in contention for a place at the Gold Coast next April.
The Rhondda athlete is looking to add the silver won in Delhi in 2010.
"I am looking to get a medal next year and won't go if I didn't think I was capable," said Parry.
Parry was the only Welsh athlete to achieve a Commonwealth Games A standard at the Welsh Championships.  It was her 12th successive Welsh title and 13th overall.
Parry  joined Melissa Courtney (1500m), Sally Peake (pole vault), Dewi Grffiths (10,000m), Ieuan Thomas (3,000m steeplechase), Josh Griffiths (marathon), Andrew Davies (marathon) David Omoregie (110m hurdles), Bethan Davies (20km walk), Jon Hopkins (3,000m steeplechase in achieving an A standard for the Gold Coast in 2018.
Brett Morse (discus), Ben Gregory (decathlon), Jennifer Nesbitt (10,000m), Heather Lewis (20km walk), Adele Nicoll (shot putt), Tom Marshall (1500m) have recorded B standards.
"I am absolutely delighted," Parry added.
"I had a bit of difficult winter and this is only my second competition back so I am pleased.
"I was walking my dog in November and I slipped down a bank and snapped my ankle and have had pins and plates put in there.
"I would hope two A standards would get me selected but you have to wait for the letter or phone call.
"It would be my fourth Commonwealth Games.
"I started in Australia in Melbourne in 2006 and maybe this would be full circle."
