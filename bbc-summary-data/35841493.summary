[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Dumfries and Galloway Council hopes to save more than £2m-a-year with an overhaul of its management structure.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Work started in December 2014 which has seen departments cut from six to four and the number of heads of service reduced to 14 from 18.
The council said that had delivered more than £500,000-a-year in savings.
Another restructure is ongoing in a bid to save more than £1.5m-a-year but the final number of management posts to be cut has not been revealed.
A council statement said it had been working on reducing management costs as one way of ensuring its "reducing resources" were directed "as far as possible" towards frontline services.
To that end, it said it had already reduced department numbers and the number of heads of service.
The local authority said the introduction of "simplified, flatter and streamlined service management and service delivery structures" was ongoing.
Savings from that process have been estimated at £1,550,000 per annum.
"This represents an identified reduction in management posts across the council," the statement said.
"We will continue to provide updates to full council until this work is complete, at which point final figures will be available."
