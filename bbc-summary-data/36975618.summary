Wasps have made another big-name signing by bringing in South Africa full-back Willie Le Roux.

Le Roux, 26, capped 37 times and nominated for world player of the year in 2014, will arrive once his current spell in Japan with Canon Eagles ends.
He joined the Japanese club after the Sharks' Super Rugby campaign ended.
"Willie has shown on a regular basis that he has the ability to be one of the best full-backs in world rugby," said Wasps director of rugby Dai Young.
"When we were looking to replace Charles Piutau, who is up there in the world's top two or three international full-backs, Willie was certainly in that level of international company.
"We now have fantastic facilities and the best way to fill those facilities is to play entertaining rugby and to have some of the best players in the world in your team. Willie falls into that category.
"We are also fortunate to have Rob Miller, who has shown his ability at full-back on a regular basis, and is in the same attacking mould. Between Rob and Willie, we feel we can more than hold our own against any team in the full-back category.
"Willie and Rob are also comfortable on the wing and Rob can also cover 10, so we've got versatility."
Wasps have made 13 new signings to counterbalance the 13 players who have left, including both Piutau brothers, Charles and Siale, Australia flanker George Smith and Wales lock forward Bradley Davies.
The list of incoming players includes England pair Danny Cipriani and Kyle Eastmond, who followed the signing of Australian full-back Kurtley Beale.
But they could start the season without both Beale, who is ahead of schedule in his recovery from the knee injury he suffered in May, and joint captain James Haskell, who is out for up to six months with a foot injury.
"Our medical team at Wasps have been in close contact with their counterparts at the NSW Waratahs," said Young. "We're happy that Kurtley is moving in the right direction. We're all looking forward to him joining up with the squad in mid-August, but our priority is the player's welfare."
