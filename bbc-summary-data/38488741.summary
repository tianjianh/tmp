Southern rail strike: Rail unions urged to stop 'pointless action'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Rail unions involved in the long-running dispute over the role of guards on Southern trains have been urged to stop their "pointless action".

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
As RMT members continued a 72-hour walkout, which began on New Year's Eve, Govia Thameslink (GTR) said the "door remained open for productive talks".
A spokesman for Southern's parent firm said "the transfer to driver-controlled operation" had almost been completed.
The RMT union said its members remained "rock solid in defence of rail safety".
Train fares rise by an average of 2.3%
Many services across the network have been cancelled during the latest three-day walkout with some routes having no trains at all.
Another strike lasting for six days and involving both the RMT and Aslef unions is set to begin on 9 January.
It will involve train drivers from both unions, with most routes not expected to have any services.
The train drivers' union Aslef is continuing with a ban on overtime, adding to the disruption.
