[SN]TITLE[SN]
Morecambe 2-0 Cambridge United

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Morecambe veteran Kevin Ellison scored two goals in five minutes to help his side beat Cambridge to pick up their second successive win.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Winger Ellison opened the scoring five minutes into the second half when he volleyed home from close range after U's goalkeeper Will Norris had superbly saved Michael Duckworth's initial effort.
The home side doubled the lead five minutes later when Ellison was again in the right place at the right time to put the ball into the empty net after Norris could only parry an excellent effort from Paul Mullin into the path of the Morecambe veteran.
The Shrimps continued to press but Norris made excellent stops to deny Lee Molyneux on two occasions and Aaron Wildig, while at the other end Cambridge produced just one effort of note when Barry Corr fired wide.
Morecambe thought they had taken the lead in the ninth minute when Peter Murphy scored from a Michael Rose corner but the effort was disallowed for handball.
The home side continued to look lively going forward and Mullin went close to putting them in front when his shot from a tight angle beat Norris but came back off the foot of a post.
After a quiet start, Cambridge began to look dangerous themselves with Piero Mingoia forcing Barry Roche into a neat save with a shot from distance before Jake Carroll hit the woodwork when he did well to get on the end of Luke Berry's cross.
