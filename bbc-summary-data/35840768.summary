Posner's dance track, I Took a Pill in Ibiza, secured the number one spot after a close race with Lukas Graham's 7 Years - beating it by a mere 261 combined chart sales.
The Official Charts Company said it was the closest chart race since 2007.
7 Years was still the most-streamed track of the week with more than four million listens.
The only time there has been a narrower margin between the top two singles was when Timbaland and Keri Hilson's The Way I Are beat Kate Nash's Foundations by just 16 copies.
I Took a Pill in Ibiza is the first UK number one for Posner, who reached number five with Cooler Than Me in 2010 and featured on Cher Lloyd's With Ur Love, which peaked at number four the following year.
Swedish singer Zara Larsson's Lush Life climbed one place to reach number three, its highest position to date, while Fifth Harmony's Work From Home went up seven places to reach number four.
Work, by Rihanna featuring Drake, dropped two places to number five.
Zayn Malik achieved his second top 40 single since leaving One Direction, with Like I Would entering the chart at number 30.
The highest new entry was Ariana Grande's Dangerous which entered the charts at number 17, while US pop star Selena Gomez saw her ballad, Hands to Myself, climb 11 places to number 21; and Joe Jonas and his band DNCE climbed 16 places to 26 with Cake By the Ocean.
There is little change on the Official Albums Chart, with only the second and third albums swapping places this week.
Adele's 25 remained at the top of the chart for a second week - its 11th week at number one in total - and outsold the number two album, Justin Bieber's Purpose, by more than 10,000 copies.
The Canadian singer is yet to achieve his second number one album, despite tracks from Purpose holding the number one, two and three spots in the singles chart at the same time - making Bieber the first artist to achieve this feat.
Jess Glynne's I Cry When I Laugh falls one place to number three, ahead David Bowie's Best of Bowie at four and Coldplay's A Head Full of Dreams at number five.
US metalcore band Killswitch Engage achieved their first UK top 10 album with Incarnate, at number 10.
There was also a new entry at 16 for You and I, a posthumous compilation album of Jeff Buckley songs.
The highest climber in the album charts is Walking on Cars' debut Everything This Way, climbing 59 places to 39, while Californian church group Bethel Music achieved their second UK top 40 album with Have it All - Live at Bethel Church, at number 40.
