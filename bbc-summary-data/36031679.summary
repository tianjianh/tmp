The nine-floor building, part of Ipswich Hospital, was hit on Tuesday evening.
Just before 19:00 GMT, Hospital chief executive Nick Hulme tweeted that a "massive clap of thunder and lightning has struck the building".
A hospital spokesman said patient care had not been affected but the unit's bleeper system was down.
Mr Hulme said everything was "safe" but there may be disruption for a while.
Hospital co-ordinator Karen Lough said the maternity unit was "fully operational" and the contingency plans had worked.
"We are using phones and radio communication to replace our bleeper system, but patient care has not been affected," she said.
