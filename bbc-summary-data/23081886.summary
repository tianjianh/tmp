Birmingham Central Library timeline

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
After 40 years, Birmingham Central Library closed to the public on 29 June 2013, ahead of the opening of a new Â£190m library.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The old library officially opened in 1974 and was once described by Prince Charles as looking like "a place where books are incinerated, not kept".
Three libraries have stood on the site since 1865. Now, demolition work has begun to make way for the Paradise Circus development.
The new library in Centenary Square was designed by Dutch architects Mecanoo and opened on 3 September 2013.
