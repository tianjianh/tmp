Prime Minister David Cameron calls for 'sensible' ticket prices

Prime Minister David Cameron wants top-flight ticket prices at a "sensible level" but stopped short of backing fan representation on the boards of clubs.

Cameron looked into the issue of rising prices after a request by shadow sports minister Clive Efford.
Efford proposed fans at board level but Cameron instead called for regular meetings between them and clubs.
The Football Supporters' Federation (FSF) welcomed the Prime Minister's comments regarding the issue.
From next season, Premier League clubs will benefit from a new three-year £5.1bn domestic television rights deal.
When overseas rights contracts are taken into consideration, that sum jumps to about £8bn.

"At a time when there is more money flowing into the Premier League than ever before, it should not be forgotten that this success is built upon the hard work and the money of millions of loyal supporters," Cameron wrote in a letter to Efford.
"Clubs need to ensure that their ticket policies provide the right balance between value for supporters and generating the income necessary to sustain their businesses."
Last month, Liverpool fans walked out of a game after 77 minutes in protest at a top-price ticket of £77 for next season before the club's owners scrapped the plan.
BBC Sport's Price of Football study found two thirds of Premier League tickets were frozen or reduced in price in 2015.
"Clubs should also take note of the PM's belief that there needs to be stronger dialogue between clubs and fans - it's something clubs have signed up to via an Expert Working Group and they must deliver on that commitment," the FSF said.
