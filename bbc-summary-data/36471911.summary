The 25-year-old spent 2015-16 on loan in the Championship at Charlton, scoring five goals in 37 games but not preventing them from being relegated.
Capped six times by Denmark, 6ft 7ins Makienok scored 35 times in 74 games for Brondby before joining Palermo.
"His height, plus his international experience, brings us a different dimension," said boss Simon Grayson.
Makienok is North End's second signing of the summer, following goalkeeper Chris Maxwell's move from Lancashire neighbours Fleetwood.
