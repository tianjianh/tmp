Calvin Andrew: Rochdale striker's ban reduced to nine games

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Rochdale striker Calvin Andrew's 12-match ban for elbowing Oldham defender Peter Clarke has been reduced to nine.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The suspension was cut following a hearing at Wembley on Thursday.
Andrew, 29, was not punished for the incident during the game on 29 October, but was later cited after a Football Association video review.
The usual punishment for violent conduct is three games, with Andrew's initial 12-match ban one of the longest handed out in English football.
