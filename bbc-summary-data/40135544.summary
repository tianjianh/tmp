US Postal Service worker Susanna Dawn Burhans, 47, is charged with aggravated cruelty to animals. She was detained after a two-week investigation.
"We gathered intelligence from the Postal Service and put everything together," a policeman told AL.com.
Police believe she may have harmed other dogs along her mail route.
"Right now, we know for sure there's one dog," said Sheriff's Capt Mike Salomonsky.
"But there's another neighbour that had a complaint, so there might be two or more," he added.
New Hope resident Ed Glover told WHNT-News that Burhans had been his postwoman.
He said that he found one of the meatballs on the ground near his letter box, and brought his dog Missy in for X-rays after finding the nails.
Burhans was released from Madison County Jail on bail.
