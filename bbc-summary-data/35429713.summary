The 33-year-old has made 16 appearances for Teddy Sheringham's strugglers since joining in the summer.
McCombe, who left Doncaster after playing 59 games over three years before moving to Stevenage, last played on 16 January in the 3-2 defeat by promotion contenders Plymouth.
He becomes the second Stevenage player to leave by mutual consent in two days, after fellow defender Mark Hughes.
