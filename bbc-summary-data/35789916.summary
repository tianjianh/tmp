Brendan Moore: Torquay United sign Fleetwood Town goalkeeper on loan

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Torquay United have signed Fleetwood Town's American goalkeeper Brendan Moore on a month's loan.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 23-year-old comes in as cover for Wigan loanee Dan Lavercombe, who is likely to be out for three weeks after suffering a groin injury in the 0-0 draw against Braintree on Tuesday.
Moore has yet to make his debut for the Cod Army, having signed for the club in February last year.
He will be available for Torquay's trip to Aldershot on Saturday.
Torquay's other two goalkeepers, Grant Fisher or Scott Corderoy, are on non-contract deals after arriving from local non-league sides and neither has played a first-team game for the Gulls.
