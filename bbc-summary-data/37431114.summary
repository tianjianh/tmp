Lawro's Premier League predictions v darts star Michael van Gerwen

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
BBC Sport's football expert Mark Lawrenson will be making a prediction for all 380 Premier League games this season against a variety of different guests.

Lawro's opponent for this week's Premier League fixtures is world number one darts player Michael van Gerwen
Van Gerwen is one of eight players competing in the Champions League of Darts, a new PDC tournament to be shown live on the BBC on 24 and 25 September.
The Dutchman is a PSV Eindhoven fan, whose hero as a boy was Ruud van Nistelrooy.
"Ruud was probably my favourite player, but I was a big fan of Mark van Bommel too," Van Gerwen told BBC Sport.
"PSV are doing all right at the moment - we took four points out of six against Manchester United in the Champions League group stage last season - but overall right now Dutch football is not very strong."
You can make your own predictions now, compare them with those of Lawro and other fans, and try to take your team to the top of the leaderboard by playing the new BBC Sport Predictor game.
A correct result (picking a win, draw or defeat) is worth 10 points. The exact score earns 40 points.
In the last round of fixtures before the international break, Lawro got seven correct results, with no perfect scores, from 10 Premier League matches. That gave him a total of 70 points.
He beat Radio 1Xtra DJ Charlie Sloth, who got five correct results, with no perfect scores, for a total of 50 points.
All kick-offs 15:00 BST unless otherwise stated.
