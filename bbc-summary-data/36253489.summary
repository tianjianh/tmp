[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Poyet, 47, who left Greek side AEK Athens last month, had been clear favourite to become the new manager of Championship side Nottingham Forest.
Uruguayan Poyet steered the Black Cats to Premier League safety in 2014, but was sacked the following season after a run of poor results.
Poyet replaces interim boss Juan Merino at the La Liga club.
