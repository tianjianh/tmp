Manchester United already have the "perfect" replacement for David De Gea should the Spanish goalkeeper leave for Real Madrid, according to former Red Devils keeper Raimond van der Gouw.

United signed Victor Valdes, 33, in January - and Van der Gouw said he "has what it takes to stay at the top".
De Gea, 24, is out of contract next summer and has yet to sign a new deal.
Boss Louis van Gaal believes interest from Real would make it "difficult for De Gea to decide".
De Gea joined United from Atletico Madrid in the summer of 2011 and was the club's player of the year last season.
Valdes, meanwhile, made his United debut in the 1-1 draw against Arsenal on Sunday having arrived at Old Trafford from Barcelona on a free transfer at the beginning of the year.
Capped 20 times by Spain, he made his debut for Barca in 2002 and won 21 major titles for the club.
Van der Gouw, who played for United between 1996 and 2002, said Valdes has the experience to "deal with the pressure at a club like United".
The Dutchman said Valdes's impact at Old Trafford could match that of Edwin van der Sar, who retired aged 40 in 2011, having won four Premier League titles and the 2008 Champions League.
"With what he knows about football and the way he is playing, he is perfect for United," Van der Gouw told BBC Sport. "He can play for another three or four years in a top team.
"Van der Sar played and did a great job."
