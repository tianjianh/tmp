One-Day Cup: Yorkshire and Durham through after wash-out

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Yorkshire progressed to the quarter-finals of the One-Day Cup after their last group game against Northants at Headingley was washed out by rain.

The no-result also sent Durham into the last eight at Northants' expense by virtue of their superior run-rate.
After an initial shower, umpires Stephen Gale and Jeff Evans hoped to start a 43-over game at 11:45 BST.
But the rain returned before play could get under way and the match was abandoned in mid-afternoon.
Both sides received one point, with Yorkshire finishing third in Group A and Durham fourth, with the latter's run rate of 0.402 superior to the -0.458 of Northants.
Surrey and Gloucestershire had already qualified from the group, with the quarter-finals set to take place between 25-27 August.
Yorkshire coach Jason Gillespie:
"The weather has worked in our favour, but you always want to play cricket if you can and we would have preferred it to be a nice clear day and to have won the game on merit.
"But you have to make the best of the situation and we are very satisfied to get through to the quarter-finals.
"We always attempt to win every game we play in every competition and we are looking at getting to Lord's and winning the final."
Northants head coach David Ripley:
"We would have gone into the match having won our last three fixtures in the competition which suggests that we are playing good cricket at the right time.
"The forecast was pretty grim from the start of the day and it proved to be right, although going out without playing still feels tough.
"At least we have got the T20 Finals Day to look forward to. We may go into them as underdogs again but we don't mind the tag, just as we didn't (when we won it) two years ago."
