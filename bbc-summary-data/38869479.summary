The world number 66 followed up his earlier wins over Mark Selby and Barry Hawkins by beating world number two Stuart Bingham 6-4.
Hamilton, 45, whose last final was at the 2002 China Open, will face Ali Carter in Sunday's decider.
Carter, the 2013 winner, beat defending champion Martin Gould 6-2.
The world number 14 took control after establishing a 3-1 lead, winning a tense sixth frame on the black to go 4-2 ahead before wrapping up victory.
"It was workmanlike, but on the whole a good performance," he told World Snooker.
"I made a couple of really good clearances but there was a lot of pressure.
This is one of my favourite events and to win it would be extra special."
Hamilton led 5-1 at one stage but Bingham fought back to 5-4 with breaks of 80 and 55 before Hamilton, who has never won a ranking title, sealed it with a break of 77 in the 10th frame.
