Man on trial over baby's broken leg

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man has gone on trial accused of wrenching a baby out of her cot so forcefully that her leg broke.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The eight-month-old child was left with a full-thickness spiral fracture of the femur after the alleged incident.
It is said to have happened on 3 March 2015 at a house where Aaron Brown, 22, had been awake all night playing video games.
Mr Brown, from Kippen, Stirling, denies the charge. The trial is expected to last two to three days.
The baby's mother, who like the child cannot be identified, said the day of the incident had been the baby's first snowy day, so she had taken her outside to see it.
She then put her down for a nap at about 09:00 or 10:00.
The 20-year-old mother said she also went for a nap, as she had been up all night playing on an Xbox with Mr Brown.
The court heard that between 13:00 and 14:00, she woke to hear the baby crying with what "sounded like discomfort". She went into the baby's room to find that Mr Brown had lifted her out of her cot and was holding her.
She said the child had stopped crying by then, but when she went to feed and change her she started screaming when she was moved.
Jurors were told a hospital X-ray later found the child's left femur had been fractured.
The baby's mother said she later talked to Mr Brown about it.
"I asked him if anything had happened, and he said her leg had been stuck in the cot, down the side of a bar," she told the court.
Jurors were also played a recording of a 50-minute interview that Mr Brown gave to police at Falkirk when he was detained 15 days after the incident.
On the video tape, Mr Brown said the baby had woken up "with a harsh cry".
He said: "When I went to pick her up her arm was trapped in the bottom bars of the cot and her leg was in the one that goes down the wall.
"I tried lifting her up and she was, like, stuck. I put her back down and she cried harsher."
He claimed he had lifted her "cautiously".
Dr Ishaq Abu-Arafeh, consultant paediatrician at the Forth Valley Royal Hospital, said the "oblique" fracture might have involved "twisting".
He said: "One can safely say it [this type of fracture] requires a significant force."
Falkirk Sheriff Court heard that the baby - described as otherwise healthy, clean, and well-nourished - spent a week with her leg in traction and was in hospital for a further week after that.
She was then released into the care of her grandmother and returned to her mother by social workers four weeks later. Despite her injury, she recovered, and was walking by the time she was 11 months old.
The trial, before Sheriff Craig Caldwell and a jury, continues.
