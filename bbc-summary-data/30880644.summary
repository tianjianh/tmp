[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Robert Gordon University (RGU) has received the grant from Communities and Culture Network+ to map post-referendum social media activity.
Voters who were aged 16 to 19 at the time will be assessed.
It will look at any resulting broader engagement with politics.
The researchers will work in association with the Scottish Youth Parliament.
Lead researcher Dr Peter McLaverty, said: "Our interviews will cover topics such as their likelihood of voting in upcoming elections, their ongoing involvement in social media sites such as Twitter, and the political connections they make through these, as well as their involvement in equivalent offline political and civic activities.
"We will also conduct a series of interviews with campaign groups and political parties to determine their views on whether political engagement among young people, particular via social media, has been sustained in the post-referendum period.
"Combined with the outcomes of our social media mapping, the research will not only provide a broad understanding of how the referendum-related engagement has been sustained, but also a deeper understanding of the relationship between the referendum and ongoing engagement in political and civic activism."
