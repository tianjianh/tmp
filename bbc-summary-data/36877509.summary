Burnley's Andre Gray has criticised two fans of his own club for allegedly making racist comments to a Bradford player during Saturday's friendly.

Officials asked a Burnley fan to leave Bradford's stadium after repeated comments directed at the home player.
Another supporter left voluntarily, although no arrests were made, and Burnley have apologised to the Bantams player and pledged to investigate.
Gray tweeted that the two fans involved "still live in the stone ages".
Apologising to both the Bradford player and the club, Burnley said they "strongly condemn discrimination of any type".
Bradford also issued a statement which said the supporter, who denied racist behaviour, "was warned by match stewards that if such abuse was witnessed and continued he would be ejected".
Bradford added: "The spectator made a further comment and at this point the player reported the abuse to the assistant referee.
"Additional staff were deployed to the area in which Burnley supporters were seated and following continued abuse he was ejected.
"They refused to give any personal details and because the match was operated on an unreserved ticket basis we cannot identify the individual involved.
"However, there is CCTV footage of the incident and we are working closely with Burnley FC and West Yorkshire police on the matter."
