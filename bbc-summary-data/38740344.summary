[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Leeds United moved to within a point of third-placed Reading by winning at Championship strugglers Blackburn.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Chris Wood had the best chance of the first half for the visitors but shot wide, while Kemar Roofe headed over.
All the goals came in a dramatic final 17 minutes, with Stuart Dallas' strike into the corner putting Leeds ahead.
Elliott Bennett's shot from 20 yards looked to have stolen a point for the hosts before Pontus Jansson won it when he headed in Pablo Hernandez's corner.
Blackburn, who now have only one win in their last 11 Championship matches, remain 23rd in the table and are three points adrift of Burton, in 21st, who lost 2-0 at home to Fulham.
The hosts had the ball in the net as early as the fourth minute, but Jason Lowe's effort was disallowed for a foul on Rob Green.
Leeds went ahead when captain Liam Bridcutt set up Dallas at the back post for his first league goal of the season, before Rovers levelled when Bennett's bobbling shot wrong-footed Green.
But a minute from the end, Hernandez won a corner and his accurate delivery found Jansson to head into the top left-hand corner.
Blackburn manager Owen Coyle:
"I don't think there's any doubt about the disappointment we feel. I thought we looked the team at 0-0 that would get in front.
"We certainly put enough into game to be taking something. Certainly a minimum of a point and probably with a bit of luck, maybe all three.
"There's no doubt it's very galling, disappointing, but those are the margins in this league and if you're going to switch off for any given moment in the Championship, you're going to get punished."
Leeds United boss Garry Monk:
"It wasn't pretty by any stretch of the imagination. Neither team got control of anything. (It was) a bit to and fro, a bit of a grind.
"We defended our box very well, stayed strong when it was difficult and in those crucial moments we scored two good goals. Yes (we were) a bit lucky to come away with the three points but the mentality and character is what I was pleased with.
"We know we didn't perform near our level but we found a way to win and, for me, that's a real good sign for a good team with a strong mentality."
