[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Fears about further ground movement around a sinkhole have been allayed by initial test results, a council said.

Engineers had raised concerns the ground around the hole in St Albans could be moving but "early indications" show "very little movement".
The 33ft (10m) deep hole appeared in Fontmell Close on 1 October and has since been filled with 48 lorry-loads of foamed concrete.
Hertfordshire County Council said work would continue to monitor the area.
The council started monitoring the surface of the concrete in the hole and the surrounding ground on 8 October and said initial results would be ready in a week.
A spokeswoman said a geophysical survey had been carried out on the highway and footway for the whole of Fontmell Close and neighbouring Bridle Close and there had also been a slight movement of the concrete "plug".
"Levels show that the concrete has settled by 5-8mm, but this was to be expected due to the weight of the concrete over the top of the loosened ground," she said.
"If residents are concerned about anything they should let one of the authorities know."
If anyone is worried about further sinkholes opening up in the highway or footway near their home they should report them to the council, she said.
