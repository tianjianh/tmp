The Scot's 7-1 victory puts him just one point behind Adrian Lewis, who still occupies the final play-off spot despite a 7-2 defeat by Phil Taylor.
Gary Anderson beat Robert Thornton 7-1 to qualify and will join Michael van Gerwen, who won 7-2 against Raymond van Barneveld, and Taylor in the play-offs.
Rotterdam hosts the event next week, with the play-offs in London on 19 May.
It is the first time the Premier League has been to Holland in its 11-year history, with Wright facing home favourite Van Barneveld and Lewis playing reigning Premier League and world champion Anderson.
Dutchman Van Gerwen will also take on 16-time world champion Taylor - the winner topping the table and picking up a Â£25,000 league leaders' bonus.
James Wade 1-7 Peter Wright
Gary Anderson 7-1 Robert Thornton
Michael van Gerwen 7-2 Raymond van Barneveld
Adrian Lewis 2-7 Phil Taylor
