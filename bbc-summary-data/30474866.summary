China media: Japan ties

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Papers urge Japanese PM Shinzo Abe to "walk the talk" to improve bilateral ties after his ruling coalition won parliamentary elections on Sunday.

His election victory comes a day after China held its first state Nanjing Massacre memorial ceremony, where Chinese President Xi Jinping criticised Japanese nationalists for denying history.
China says 300,000 civilians were massacred when Japan's troops occupied the city in 1937, although some Japanese nationalists dispute this.
Last month, both countries reached a consensus to resume dialogue after strained bilateral ties over rival territorial claims in the East China Sea and disputes about Japan's World War II history.
The official Xinhua News Agency has published a series of reports and articles on Japan's election, warning the Abe administration to "shake off the rightist ideology".
Mr Abe's victory is "no reflection of public will" but "a simple economic referendumâ€¦ as no other party stood nearly close enough to deliver on any of their pledges", a Xinhua report quotes observers as saying.
Another article summarises China's position on its ties with Japan.
"China and Japan, whose relations have been constantly troubled by Japan's increasingly right-tilting moves over the past few years, have reached a four-point agreement in November. Now the onus is on Mr Abe to walk his talk," says the article.
Several domestic papers, including the Beijing Times and the Beijing News, sound a note of caution over Mr Abe's military intentions.
An expert tells the Global Times' Chinese edition that the victory "may not be a disaster to Beijing-Tokyo relations", but Mr Abe has to work on improving bilateral ties now that he has reinforced his position at home.
Elsewhere, the unruly behaviour of four Chinese passengers aboard an international flight has drawn strong criticism from state media.
According to reports, four Chinese passengers lashed out at a flight attendant in an AirAsia flight to Nanjing in eastern China from Bangkok, Thailand. One of the four even threatened to blow up the plane.
The plane was forced to return to Bangkok on Thursday night after the scuffle in the air.
The four passengers were fined by Thailand authorities and were asked to compensate for throwing hot water on the air crew.
The incident sparked outrage among the Chinese netizens after the news was reported in the Chinese media.
Many are criticising them for "hurting the image of the country", while National Tourism Administration (NTA), China's tourism authority, has announced over the weekend that these passengers will be "punished".
Reprimanding the passengers, the China Daily said it was an "ugly incident" and described them as "barbarians".
"Of course, such isolated incidents do not represent the Chinese people. But they do tarnish their image," stresses the paper.
"The incident should serve as a lesson not just for the four culprits, but also for all Chinese to behave properly to get respect," it adds.
The Global Times reports that the passengers' "misconduct" will be included in the new personal travel records set up by the NTA.
"The administration's move should be encouraged, as it is the first time they have clearly stipulated that public behaviour should not only be punished by law, but also regulated by a record system," Su Haopeng, vice-dean of the Law School at the University of International Business and Economics, tells the paper.
And finally, several media outlets shine a spotlight on an ancient Chinese temple that has been turned into a "private luxurious club".
According to Xinhua, the club is located within a famous ancient temple near the historical Forbidden City in Beijing.
The news agency notes that the temple is only accessible to "members" where they could sit on the golden "dragon chair" and enjoy other luxurious services. The report adds that the temple houses a lavish Western restaurant and its hall has been "elaborately decorated".
The Beijing Times notes that some "officials" frequently visit the "temple".
The paper also calls for more stringent checks after rules banning such clubs within historic buildings and parks came into effect last month.
