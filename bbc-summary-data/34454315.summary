Hundreds of free events will take place as part of Book Week Scotland 2015 which runs from 23 to 29 November.
More than 300,000 free books will also be given away.
The theme for this year's event is transformation with people urged to share a book that changed their life.
Authors and illustrators will visit libraries in every local authority, with appearances by the likes of Diana Gabaldon, Kate Mosse, AL Kennedy, Arne Dahl and The Girl on a Train author Paula Hawkins.
A new campaign called #ThankBooks will be launched, encouraging members of the public to share how books or people from the world of books have inspired them or changed their life.
Celebrities and authors such as Alan Cumming, Ian Rankin, Louis De Bernieres, Andy McNab and Greg Proops will also reveal their own #ThankBooks.
Marc Lambert, chief executive of the Scottish Book Trust said: "The huge personal benefits in health and wellbeing that flow from spending just a short time each day lost within a book are now widely documented and understood.
"But it seems that people still remain to be convinced. Can a book really transform the way we feel? Can it lighten your mood, ensure a better night's sleep, steal away loneliness?
"This year we are challenging Scots from all walks of life to try this miracle cure out for themselves - and to share their stories and results with us in a celebration of all the things books and reading can do."
There will also be appearances by the likes of Brian Blessed and Cathy Rentzenbrink in unusual locations across the country.
During the week, 150,000 free copies of a short story and poem collection written by ordinary Scottish people, Journeys, will be handed out via libraries, bookshops and other outlets.
In addition to this three free picture books, comprising the shortlist for the Scottish Children's Book Awards 2016, will be gifted to every Primary 1 pupil in Scotland.
Culture Secretary Fiona Hyslop said: "Book Week Scotland is a wonderful opportunity to celebrate reading and literature. The pleasure of reading cannot be underestimated.
"As well as broadening the mind and nourishing the soul, reading provides a range of mental health and wellbeing benefits that should not be ignored."
