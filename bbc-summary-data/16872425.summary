Teacher resources: Getting ready for News Day

This guide is here to help you, with lots of tips on what to do in the run-up to our 11th annual News Day on Thursday 16 March 2017.

It includes guidance on how to manage the big day itself and how to ensure your school gets as much BBC coverage as possible.
As you turn your classrooms into newsrooms, these printable posters, press passes, cut-out-and-make microphone cubes and certificates will help transform your building into a professional news-making environment.
Create your own dedicated web page
Prepare a simple holding page, with a "come back at 1600 GMT on 16 March 2017" message, and send the address of the dedicated web page (URL) to the School Report team. This guide - Prepare your school web page - provides some handy hints and tips for setting up the page.
Tell us what you're working on
The School Report team wants to know what news topics you are looking at. We may be able to offer some help and advice.
Find out more on teacher Jo Debens' blog.
We may even be able to visit your school to help your students turn their idea into a report.
In addition, schools contacting the team before the day may be featured on the School Report channels - streamed on the BBC website on 16 March - or be featured elsewhere on the BBC (e.g. local radio or websites).
Prepare some news features
During previous years, School Reporters have found it useful to prepare a few reports in advance, basing them on news themes which will still be relevant on the News Day in March.
Your reports can be uploaded to your dedicated web page now, or held back until the big News Day.
Inform your local news outlets
Local newspapers, radio and television outlets are always looking to cover interesting events such as School Report News Day.
However, journalists at local papers are often busy and don't have the time to visit your school. Why don't you take the initiative and write the story for them? That way your school stands a good chance of appearing in the paper.
Before News Day in March, you could send in a story about your plans for the day, or you could write up a report afterwards.
Newspapers often refer to stories sent in by the public as press releases - they are details about an event released to the press. You might find some good tips in this guide: How to write a press release.
Plan your News Day schedule
Teachers who have participated in previous years' News Days have found that the day naturally follows the news-making process: find, gather, write and broadcast, and have scheduled activities accordingly.
This timetable, devised by Oldham City Learning Centre, may be a useful template. It describes activities for students creating a TV and a radio bulletin, but may be adapted for students creating text-based reports.
Alternatively, you could use this guide, based on a practice day by Waldegrave Girls School in Twickenham, Middlesex.
Announce School Report in an assembly
Why not tell the rest of the school about School Report during an assembly?
Not only will this encourage students to look at School Reporters' work on the school website on News Day, but it is also a great way to run through your plans ahead of the day. Share your plans for News Day. Who are you interviewing? Which stories are already lined up?
For more ideas take a look at how the 2015 News Day unfolded.
Remind students of the School Report essentials
On the News Day, remind students of the School Report rules:
There's more information about these golden rules in the School Report guide to keeping your news safe and legal.
Dress your newsroom
Print copies of the School Report poster in the "cut out and keep" box at the top of the page and use them to dress your newsroom. You can also make your own School Report microphone cubes using the template provided.
Reward students with certificates
Download a School Report certificate from the "cut out and keep" box at the top of the page and distribute copies to your students at the end of the News Day.
And not forgetting, most importantly - have fun!
