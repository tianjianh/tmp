Istiak Yusuf died in a cell at Luton police station on Saturday after he was arrested at the Purley Centre.
An Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) investigation will examine the circumstances of his death.
Solicitor Attiq Malik said Mr Yusuf's relatives were "very eager" to find out what happened to him.
"The family are distraught and devastated at the fact that such a young member of their family, the father of a six month old baby, has suddenly passed away whilst in police custody," Mr Malik said.
"The next step is once the medical examinations are completed and a cause of death is identified, the body will be released and the burial will take place.
"At this stage, that's the most important thing for them."
An initial post-mortem examination proved inconclusive, Mr Malik said.
He added the family were unaware of any pre-existing medical condition, which might have contributed to Mr Yusuf's death.
Bedfordshire Police said there was "nothing to suggest this tragic death was caused by any police action" but was "determined that a full and transparent investigation is conducted".
In a statement, Deputy Chief Constable Jon Boutcher said the force's thoughts were with Mr Yusuf's family.
"We will do all we can to co-operate with the investigation and help provide the family, the coroner and the IPCC with accurate information about how and why he tragically died," he said.
