Rain interrupted the match in Belgrade, but it did not affect the 21-year-old's concentration as he beat the former world number eight 6-3 6-4 6-0.
Tipsarevic, who returned in April after two years out, struggled throughout.
James Ward will play Dusan Lajovic in the next singles rubber, which will start at 11:00 BST on Saturday.
Great Britain are defending the title they won in Belgium last year.
Edmund is leading the team, with Wimbledon champion Andy Murray in Belgrade only as a supporter.
The world number 67 proved himself to be a worthy stand-in and produced great power on his groundstrokes, reminiscent of Murray

His forehand, in particular, was a weapon, as was his serve - winning points on 79% of his first serve, with Tipsarevic only managing 53%.
"To get us off to a good start was great," said Edmund. "Each set I really found my game. I was very pleased with my win.
"We played three games before it rained. I wanted to get the intensity high from the first game back after the break.
"I just tried to relax during the rain intervals. When you go back in it's almost a lull. I had some food and had a shower. It's not hard to switch on and off."
Ward, 29, was scheduled to play after the opening match, but heavy rain meant his contest against world number 81 Lajovic was delayed until Saturday.
The doubles match - scheduled to be between Britons Dominic Inglot and Jamie Murray - and Tipsarevic and Nenad Zimonjic will not start before 15:00 BST.
