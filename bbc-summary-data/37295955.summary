The 33-year-old man fell from the third-floor property in Forester Street shortly after 06:00 and died at the scene soon after.
Officers said the full circumstances surrounding his death were "unexplained".
They also said there had been a report of a disturbance at a flat in Forester Street about two hours earlier.
Ross Fairlie, 37, who works in neighbouring Rattray Street, said he had called emergency services around 06:30 after finding the man seriously hurt.
He said: "I discovered a man who was still alive at the time. He was lying in the front garden of a block of flats in Forester Street.
"The man was semi-conscious and I tried to speak to him.
"There was a woman with him and she was very distressed. She said he had fallen from the third-floor window."
Mr Fairlie said he immediately called 999 and stayed until paramedics arrived.
"I'm really shocked and upset by what happened - you don't expect to experience something like this when you arrive for work," he said.
