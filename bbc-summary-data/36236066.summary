Police said the girl and a friend came out of a Spar shop beside Cafe India on Great Western Road at about 01:00 and got into an argument with a man.
The man, who was in his 30s, got into a car and threw the bottle at the girl as he drove off towards Byres Road.
Police have described the attack as "despicable".
Detectives are appealing for witnesses to the attack.
They said the man had come out of the Spar shop just before the girls and got into a saloon car.
He was described as being between 30 and 35 years old, with a shaven head and wearing a dark-coloured rain jacket.
The 16-year-old was taken to the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital where she received treatment for a facial injury before being released.
Det Con Robert Allen, from Partick CID, said: "This was a despicable assault on a 16-year-old girl who has been left badly shaken and with a serious facial injury as a result.
"I would appeal to anyone who was in the area at the time of the incident and may have witnessed what happened to get in touch."
