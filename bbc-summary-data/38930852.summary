Mervyn Smyth quits in wake of County Antrim Shield final criticism

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Referee Mervyn Smyth has announced his retirement with immediate effect in the wake of criticism of his performance in Tuesday's County Antrim Shield final.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Crusaders manager Stephen Baxter branded Smyth's dismissal of Paul Heatley in the 3-1 defeat by Linfield as "an embarrassment".
The 41-year-old confirmed his intention to quit on Thursday.
The Belfast official has taken charge of fixtures in the Europa League and at under-age international level.
Smyth was temporarily stood down from Premiership duty in 2014 for a display that the Northern Ireland Football League said "fell below the expected standard".
