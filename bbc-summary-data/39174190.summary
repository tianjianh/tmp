Wales second-row Luke Charteris says he is ready start in their Six Nations match against Ireland on Friday.

Charteris missed the first two matches against Italy and England with a broken hand but was a second-half replacement in the 29-13 defeat in Scotland.
After starting for Bath in their 24-3 defeat by Wasps on Saturday, Charteris believes he is ready to face Ireland in Cardiff six days later.
"I feel good and would give it a go," the Bath lock said.
Scarlets second-row Jake Ball has partnered captain Alun Wyn Jones in the first three games.
Charteris, who will celebrate his 34th birthday on Thursday, played just under an hour in Bath's defeat against Premiership leaders Wasps at the Rec.
"It was a fast paced game," he said.
"It was good to get a run out, it has been a stop start season so far.
"The hand felt good, which was the main thing. I might have been back sooner but I managed to pull my hamstring in training.
"I am fully over that now with two games under my belt.
"Hopefully it will be good to finish the season, stay injury free and play some rugby."
Fellow Welsh forward Taulupe Faletau also played 80 minutes for Bath and is battling for a starting spot in the back-row after recovering from a knee problem.
"It is good to see him back," added Charteris.
"He is a quality player and you can see when he gets his hands on the ball he is such a threat."
