It relates to testimony given to the Finance Committee on 23 September 2015.
The BBC understands the individuals questioned were former Sinn Féin MLA Daithí McKay, loyalist blogger Jamie Bryson and Sinn Féin activist Thomas O'Hara.
A file has been sent to the Public Prosecution Service.
The £1.2bn sale by Nama - the Republic of Ireland's "bad bank" - of its Northern Ireland property loans portfolio to US firm Cerberus in 2014 was Northern Ireland's biggest ever property deal.
It is now the subject of criminal investigation and a parliamentary inquiry. Here is a guide to some of the institutions and key figures in the story.
The Stormont Nama inquiry, then chaired by Mr McKay, was set up in the wake of political controversy surrounding the sale.
It followed an allegation made in the Dáil (Irish parliament) that a politician or political party in Northern Ireland stood to profit from the loan sale.
Last August, Sinn Féin suspended Mr O'Hara and Mr McKay resigned from the party.
