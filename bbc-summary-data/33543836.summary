[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Portugal have qualified for Euro 2016 after a Joao Moutinho goal was enough to beat Denmark.

The Group I winners could be joined by the second-placed Danes or third-placed Albania, who are a point behind them.
Albania missed the chance to qualify when they lost 2-0 at home to Serbia on Thursday, almost one year after the reverse fixture was abandoned.
However, a win over bottom-team Armenia on Sunday will be enough as Denmark have played all their games.
Albanian fans had been banned from attending last year's qualifier because of a turbulent relationship between the two Balkan nations.
But when a nationalist Albanian banner was flown above the pitch and caught by a Serbian player, it sparked clashes involving players and fans on the Partizan Stadium pitch in Serbia's capital, Belgrade.
The game in Albania was played in front of a vociferous but well-behaved 13,000-strong crowd, Serbia and Manchester City left-back Aleksandar Kolarov and forward Adem Ljajic scored stoppage-time goals for the visitors.
Portugal and Northern Ireland sealed their route to France 2016 on Thursday, joining the hosts, and already qualified teams Austria, Czech Republic, England and Iceland.
