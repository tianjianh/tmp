Dean Rittenberg scored the only goal in the first half, converting player-manager Gary Taylor-Fletcher's cross.
Bangor reached Europe for the first time since the 2013-14 season.
They join league runners-up Gap Connah's Quay and Welsh Cup winners Bala Town as Wales' representatives in next season's Europa League.
Taylor-Fletcher said: "We had to dig in at the end and we were hanging in but I can't ask for anything more. We're in Europe, it's all we wanted.
"We knew we had the quality and that was the edge. They had the fitness but we had the final quality."
Cardiff Met only secured promotion to Welsh football's top flight at the start of the season after winning the Welsh League Division One title.
