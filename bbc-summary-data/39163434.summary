[SN]TITLE[SN]
Wycombe Wanderers 0-0 Blackpool

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Wycombe goalkeeper Jamal Blackman saved a penalty to thwart Blackpool for a second time this season as his side held on for a goalless draw.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 23-year-old, on loan from Chelsea, saved a penalty in normal time and one in a shoot-out when the Chairboys knocked Blackpool out of the EFL Trophy in January.
And, with four minutes left on the clock in this game, Blackman saved Brad Potts' spot-kick to preserve a point.
The first chance of the game fell to Adebayo Akinfenwa who drilled wide after 10 minutes.
Midway through the first half a speculative effort from Potts grazed Blackman's crossbar.
On the stroke of half-time Paris Cowan-Hall's low drive brought a smart save from visiting goalkeeper Dean Lyness.
Shortly after the break a Potts effort was acrobatically clawed back from the goal-line by Blackman. Blackpool claimed the ball had crossed the line but their appeals fell on deaf ears.
And Wycombe's keeper had his crowning moment in the dying stages, producing a brilliant save to deny Potts from 12 yards.
