For the first time, both finals, to be played at the O2 in London, will take place on the same day - Sunday, 8 May.
The BBL play-off final starts at 15:30 BST, with the WBBL showpiece at 18:00.
"We are delighted to be able to partner with the BBC to show both finals live," said BBL commercial director Bob Hope. "It promises to be a great day for the basketball community."
The BBL hopes having both finals on the same day will widen the event's appeal.
Hope added: "Hopefully having the BBC coverage will mean we can attract even more new fans to the sport."
