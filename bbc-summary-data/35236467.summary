The 19-year-old has played 25 times for the National League South side, who have lost just one league game since the end of August.
"I think we've proved a lot of people wrong and I feel like I've been a big part of that," said Riley-Lowe.
"Coming to Truro has helped to develop other parts of my game that I wouldn't have developed as quickly at Exeter."
