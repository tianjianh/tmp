County Championship: Jason Roy century spearheads Surrey fightback in Durham

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
England one-day opening batsman Jason Roy led the way with 120, his second first-class century of the summer, to help Surrey fight back against Durham at Chester-le-Street.

Durham added eight to their overnight score to claim full batting points, before being bowled out for 401.
Surrey then replied with 299-7 by the end of the day.
Kumar Sangakkara made 48 to go past 1,000 Championship runs for the season, while Zafar Ansari also made 48.
Ansari shared in a stand of 164 for the fourth wicket with the disciplined Roy, who hit just 15 boundaries, none of which cleared the ropes, in a more restrained sort of innings than he has become renowned for in one-day cricket.
Surrey slumped from 264-3 late in the day when Keaton Jennings made the breakthrough, before the new ball was taken and Onions (4-68) and Mark Wood (2-45) caused further damage.
Earlier, after resuming on 393-9, Durham bagged their fifth batting point before last man Onions was removed by Mark Footitt, leaving Jennings on 201, after the rare honour of both hitting a double century and carrying his bat.
It was Footitt's third 'five-for' in successive matches, following his career-best 7-62 against Lancashire, then last week's 6-161 against Hampshire - giving him 29 wickets in six matches since being recalled to Surrey's Championship side following injury in July.
Surrey's Sri Lankan legend Kumar Sangakkara is the second-oldest player (after 40-year-old Marcus Trescothick) among the nine batsmen to have reached 1,000 runs in the County Championship top flight this season.
At 38, turning 39 in October, the still classy Sangakkara is double the age of the youngest, Lancashire's prospective teenage England opener Haseeb Hameed, who does not turn 20 until January.
Surrey batsman Jason Roy told BBC Radio London:
"I'm pleased, but disappointed to get out for 120. There's a lot of work to be done, we're still 100 behind them.
"They bowled incredibly well and made it difficult for me, right up until my last run.
"I got myself in and though 'just occupy the crease, play straight and play as late as possible and what will be, will be'.
"If I got a good ball, I got a good ball and that was my undoing, it was a ball I couldn't do much with."
