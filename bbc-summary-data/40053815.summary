The Portrush golfer carded four birdies in a bogey-free 66 to trail Americans Derek Fathauer, JT Poston and Kelly Kraft, at the Fort Worth course.
The 2010 US Open champion is joined on four under by Scott Brown and Spaniard Jon Rahm at the PGA Tour tournament.
Defending champion Jordan Spieth closed with two birdies to finish level par.
The 23-year-old American has missed the cut in his last two tournaments and was two over after four holes but birdied the fifth and seventh.
Spieth moved under par with a birdie on the 13th but he found a bunker with his tee shot on the 15th and hit his next into water on his way to a double bogey, before dropping another shot on the 16th.
McDowell, who is without a top-10 finish on the PGA Tour this year, started on the back nine and birdied the 11th, 18th, fourth and seventh.
Americans Ryan Moore and Phil Mickelson are among a group of players on three under, while Masters champion Sergio Garcia is one under after a 69.
