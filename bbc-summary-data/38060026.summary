[SN]TITLE[SN]
York City 1-1 Guiseley

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Jake Cassidy's fifth goal of the season extended York's winless run as Guiseley came from behind to claim a draw in the National League.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 23-year-old smashed home from close range in the 85th minute to make it 15 games without a win for York.
The Minstermen are without a win under Gary Mills, but had chances to go ahead in the first half through Aidan Connolly, who was making his return from injury.
Jordan Preston forced a good save at the other end before substitute Callum Rzonca curled home his first senior goal shortly before the hour mark.
However, Simon Walton's free-kick dropped kindly for Cassidy at the death to ensure a share of the points.
