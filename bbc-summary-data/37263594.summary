[SN]TITLE[SN]
Fleetwood Town 2-2 Charlton Athletic

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Super-sub Lee Novak bundled in a late equaliser as Charlton fought back to draw and stop Uwe Rosler's Fleetwood from moving into the top two.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Novak diverted fellow substitute Kevin Foley's pass home in the 87th minute and the goal prevented Fleetwood from climbing over Bradford into second spot in the League One table.
Fleetwood's on-loan Burnley striker Chris Long netted his third goal in as many league games in the fourth minute as he rocketed the ball past Declan Rudd from distance.
It was all Fleetwood until Charlton finally sparked into life just after the half-hour-mark as Josh Magennis nodded in Ricky Holmes' cross in the 32nd minute.
David Ball restored Fleetwood's lead, picking up a loose ball on the edge of the box and sublimely curled the ball into the top corner in the 44th minute.
The second half was a game of attrition until the match exploded back into life in the final 15 minutes with Town keeper Chris Neal twice making fingertip saves to thwart Holmes and Novak before the striker popped up with the late leveller.
