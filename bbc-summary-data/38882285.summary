[SN]TITLE[SN]
EH Cup: Holders Guernsey knocked out by Blackheath & Old Elthamians

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Defending champions Guernsey were knocked out of the England Hockey Trophy in the third round.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
They lost 4-2 to last year's beaten finalists Blackheath & Old Elthamians.
Steve Waldrom put the island side ahead at Footes Lane and scored again late on, but it was not enough to deny the visitors a place in the next round.
The defeat means Guernsey, who had beaten London Edwardians in the previous round, will not reach the final for the first time since 2011.
