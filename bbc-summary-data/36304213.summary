Alex Dunbar: Scotland centre to miss Glasgow Pro12 games & Japan tour

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Glasgow centre Alex Dunbar will miss the rest of their Pro12 campaign and Scotland's two-Test tour of Japan next month with a knee problem.

The 26-year-old sustained a bone injury in the Warriors' defeat at Connacht on 7 May which consigned them to a semi-final back in Galway this Saturday.
Gloucester-bound centre Matt Scott will replace Dunbar in the Scotland squad.
It is the latest blow to afflict Dunbar, who only returned from a year out with another knee injury in March.
But his latest problem does not require surgery and he will now begin a period of rest and recovery with Glasgow's medical team with the aim of being fit for next season.
"We're disappointed for Alex that his season has been cut short through injury," said Warriors head coach Gregor Townsend.
"He had been playing very well and played a big role in getting us into the Pro12 play-offs.
"We wish him all the best with his rehab and we look forward to him returning to training ahead of the new season."
