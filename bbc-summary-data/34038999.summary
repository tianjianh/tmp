The NWA biopic, produced by Dr Dre and Ice Cube, took an estimated $26.8m (£17.1m), bringing its running total to over $111.5m (£71.1m).
Its continued success comes in the wake of Dr Dre saying he was sorry in a recent interview to women he has "hurt".
A number of women have claimed he was been violent towards them in the past.
In comments published on the New York Times website he said: "I deeply regret what I did and know that it has forever impacted all of our lives."
He did not give any specific reasons for the apology.
Dre pleaded no contest to charges of criminal battery after a journalist, Dee Barnes, accused him of attacking her in 1991.
In the last week she has published a story about the assault.
Michel'le, a former girlfriend of Dre's, has also accused him of violence.
Critics have accused the filmmakers of shying away from mentioning what happened with Ms Barnes, or from talking about any of the other accusations of Dre being violent.
In an interview with Newsbeat, one of the actors in the film said that certain events were not left out of the movie on purpose.
"It's impossible to fit 10 years into two and a half hours," said O'Shea Jackson Jr, who plays Ice Cube.
"Everything that is in the film are things that fall under NWA. They didn't have enough time to go towards everyone's individual stories."
In other box office news, it was a second week at number two for Tom Cruise with Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation, which took $11.7m (£7.4m) in its fourth week of release.
Low-budget horror sequel Sinister 2 was the highest new entry, with an estimated $10.6m.
Hitman: Agent 47, an adaptation of the popular video game, could only manage $8.2m, while action comedy American Ultra, starring Kristen Stewart and Jesse Eisenberg, only took $5.5m.
