The 20-year-old Dutchman has yet to make his first-team debut, but was an unused substitute for Saturday's League One game with Bolton.
"His game understanding is excellent and he is very good in possession, as a lot of players that come from Holland are," said boss Karl Robinson.
Meanwhile, the Addicks have released 23-year-old midfielder El-Hadji Ba.
