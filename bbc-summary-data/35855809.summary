[SN]TITLE[SN]
Golden State Warriors suffer rare defeat in NBA record wins chase

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Golden State Warriors suffered a setback in their quest for an NBA record of most wins in a season after losing 87-79 to San Antonio Spurs.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Warriors are 62-7 for the campaign and must win 11 of their final 13 games to beat Chicago Bulls' 1995-96 mark.
Spurs restricted Warriors to their lowest points in a regular-season encounter since February 2014.
And their own 59-10 record leaves them three behind the Warriors in the race for top seeding in the play-offs.
Warriors guard Stephen Curry only added one-three pointer from nine attempts in a total of 14 points, but extended his own NBA record-breaking tally for a season to 337 baskets.
