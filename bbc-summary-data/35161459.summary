Sammy-Jo Davies, 19, died and six others suffered serious injuries.
At Merthyr Tydfil Crown Court on Tuesday, Perkins pleaded guilty to three charges, including causing death by dangerous driving.
Both his and his victims' families had to be kept at opposite ends of the courtroom and police officers were present after angry confrontations.
Perkins confirmed his name and pleaded guilty to causing serious injury by dangerous driving, causing death by dangerous driving, and aggravated vehicle taking, along with admitting driving without insurance.
Judge Richard Twomlow told him he was adjourning sentencing until January so a report could be prepared.
He warned: "It will be a considerable and substantial sentence."
