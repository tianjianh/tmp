Jeremy Corbyn hails Oldham West and Royton by-election victory

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has hailed a "vote of confidence" in his party after it comfortably won the Oldham West and Royton by-election.

Its candidate Jim McMahon secured a 10,835 majority from UKIP's John Bickley and a 62% vote share that was higher than at the general election.
The Conservatives came third in the poll, triggered by the death of long-serving Labour MP Michael Meacher.
Mr McMahon said he had "delivered a result that Michael would be proud of".
Labour was defending a 14,738 majority from the general election. While its total majority was lower this time around, it ended up with a higher vote share as the turnout - just over 40% - was lower than at May's poll.
The by-election - the first of this Parliament - was also the first major electoral test for Mr Corbyn, who was elected leader by more than half the party's membership in September.
He has faced criticism from some within his party, with few of his MPs having backed his leadership campaign while senior figures warned he would damage Labour's electoral chances.
Mr Corbyn said: "By-elections can be difficult for the party holding the seat, and turnouts are often low.
"But to increase our share of the vote since the general election is a vote of confidence in our party.
"It's a clear demonstration that Labour is the party working people trust."

This was a surprise result for Labour, but an unexpectedly good one.
Not only was it almost 11,000 votes ahead of UKIP, the party also increased its vote share. Only a fortnight ago some were predicting a shock defeat.
Nobody anticipated a victory on this scale. Undoubtedly a large part of it must be down to the candidate Jim McMahon, the former council leader.
He was recognised as the local candidate. But UKIP tried to turn this into a referendum on Jeremy Corbyn, even branding him a "security risk". Clearly it failed and suggests he's not as politically toxic as his opponents wish.
UKIP blames the postal vote and the number of Asian voters who use it. But that's the system the party is up against.
UKIP's result was far worse than Heywood and Middleton and much more disappointing than it expected. And it leaves them struggling with a strategy to win seats from Labour in the north of England.
Mr McMahon, 35, is the leader of Oldham Council and Labour's most senior representative in the Local Government Association. He is regarded as being a centrist within the Labour Party.
He said it was a "staggering" result for his party.
He added: "My sole focus has always been on what is best for Oldham. I want to make our town a better place for my sons to grow up in and make it somewhere they can be proud of. My priority will always be Oldham."
The Conservatives came third, with their vote share down by almost 10%.
UKIP, which has been targeting Labour's vote in its northern strongholds, had hoped to make the by-election a close-fought contest.
But the outcome was clear early in the evening and Labour activists cheered their candidate when he arrived at Oldham's Queen Elizabeth Hall for the count.
Mr Bickley, nearly overturned an 11,000 Labour majority at the Heywood and Middleton by-election in October 2014, losing by just 600 votes.
He said Oldham West and Royton was a "different type of constituency with different demographics" in what he said was a "very strong Labour heartland".
UKIP also complained about the number of postal votes cast in the by-election.
