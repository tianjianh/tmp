Marc Mimram's pedestrian and cycle bridge, called Between History and Modernity, will link the new Bath Quays development with the city centre.
His design was chosen from a shortlist of 50 entries in a competition launched by Bath and North East Somerset Council in February.
The council said it expected the bridge to be built in 2017.
Marc Mimram's company has designed major infrastructure, sports and education projects around the world.
He is the architect-engineer behind such structures as the Strasbourg-Kehl Pedestrian Bridge between France and Germany, and the Palais de Justice in Paris.
Feedback received during the exhibition of the designs also showed the Paris-based team's design to be the public's favourite.
Mr Mimram said his design was inspired by a visit to Bath whose "history and relationship with the River Avon captivated me".
"I have built bridges all over the world but it has long been my ambition to build in the UK and I'm excited to be doing so in Bath," said Mr Mimram.
