The trustees behind a proposed dinosaur-themed museum in a Dorset quarry have said it will go ahead despite the death of its founder.

Michael Hanlon, who came up with the idea for the £80m attraction called Jurassica, died on 9 February aged 51 after a heart attack.
The museum, covering three geological time periods, could be built in a 40m (132ft) deep quarry in Portland.
The project's trustees said they hope to secure planning permission in 2017.
The project has Sir David Attenborough as its patron.
He said: "Michael Hanlon had a thrilling vision for Jurassica - ways of using new techniques to bring to life the ancient sea monsters whose bones are still being discovered on this part of the English Coast.
"It will transform our vision of the prehistoric world.  It must happen".
The attraction would see a glass and steel roof, about a third the size of the Millennium Dome, installed over the quarry.
It would house an aquarium with robot swimming plesiosaurs, fossils and interactive displays.
The project, which is being funded through sponsors and grants, gained charitable status in 2014. It was turned down for £16m of Heritage Lottery funding in May.
Previously organisers said they had hoped to open the attraction by 2019 or 2020.
