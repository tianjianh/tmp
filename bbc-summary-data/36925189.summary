[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Drivers have been getting stuck in major delays near Reading as the final phase of roadworks get under way as part of a Â£1m redevelopment.

The six-week A3290/A329M Loddon Viaduct project will see new bridge joints and safety barriers put up, as well as a resurfaced carriageway.
Lanes on the Reading-bound stretch of the A3290 at Winnersh have been closed.
Commuter Andrea Gaynor said her usual 35-minute journey to work now took up to two hours or more.
"It took me almost two-and-a-half hours one night. I was at Winnersh for one-hour-and-fifty minutes just trying to get off [the carriageway], along with thousands of other drivers", she said.
"Road rage is an issue and people have been swapping lanes and causing chaos. How people didn't hit each other I do not know."
Wokingham Borough Council said recent queues were due to crashes and problems elsewhere, but said it had since taken action to stop people crossing lanes in the wrong place.
Councillor Malcolm Richards, executive member for highways at the authority, said: "This work has to be done and will make the viaduct safer, quieter and easier to maintain."
The project is expected to be completed in September.
