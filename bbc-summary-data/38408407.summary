[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A sheep's head, a prosthetic leg and a ferret are among the strangest gifts people have given to charities.

The items, which feature in a top 10 list of strange donations, were given to charities including Oxfam and Guide Dogs for the Blind.
The list, which was compiled by the Charities Aid Foundation, also includes a ventriloquist dummy and two canaries.
The donations have either been left at charity shops or bequeathed as legacies.
Other goods included a Victoria Cross and a Doulton Faience ceramic vase, which was spotted by valuers working for Oxfam.
Known as a moon flask because of its shape, the Doulton Faience vase was given to one of the charity's High Street shops.
The piece - dated circa 1890 - sold for Â£2,400 at auction in June 2016.
Joanna Walker, head of private clients at CAF, said: "People's generous and unusual donations make charity shops and websites an amazing source of items to buy, helping people personalise their homes and supporting thousands of vital causes in the process."
