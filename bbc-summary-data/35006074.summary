[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Police said the man, who is still to be identified, was hit by a Volvo lorry between the Whitletts and Holmston roundabouts at about 01:25.
The 41-year-old driver contacted the emergency services and the man was taken to Ayr Hospital where he died.
No other vehicles were involved and no one else was injured. The road was closed in both directions while police investigated but has since re-opened.
Sgt Kevin Blackley said: "This was a serious collision which has resulted in the death of a man.
"The road was closed in both directions to allow specialist officers to conduct their investigation. Our inquiries continue to determine the exact circumstances surrounding the incident."
"I would therefore ask that anyone who saw the crash happen or who has any information that will help us with our enquiries to contact Irvine road policing department."
