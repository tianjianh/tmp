Brexit: Michelle O'Neill says leaving EU would be 'disastrous' for NI agri-food exports

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Northern Ireland's agriculture minister has said that a British exit from the European Union would be "disastrous" for the agri-food industry.

Michelle O'Neill said that in the event of an exit it would be "difficult to see a scenario" which allows access to EU markets on existing terms.
The minister also said it could lead to the reintroduction of customs post along the Irish border.
She said it would have a "catastrophic" impact on cross-border business.
Ms O'Neill said the EU is not perfect and the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) needs greater simplification.
About 40% of Northern Ireland's external sales of food and drink go the EU, mainly the Republic of Ireland.
The dairy industry in particular has a high degree of cross-border integration.
Ms O'Neill said there is "no clear picture" of what trade arrangements would exist if the UK left the EU.
She described leaving as "simply a gamble, and a very high stakes gamble at that".
If the UK left the EU it would have to negotiate new trade arrangements.
The best case scenario would be a comprehensive free trade deal but there is also the possibility that some products could be subject to tariffs.
Ms O'Neill said she was also sceptical that the UK government would maintain the current level of subsidies farmers receive from the EU.
Supporters of leaving the EU claim that Northern Ireland would be better off out.
Former Stormont finance minister Sammy Wilson has said Northern Ireland could get "an additional Â£540m in its budget" if the UK leaves.
He claimed the annual block grant would likely benefit from the UK saving on its financial contribution to Europe.
