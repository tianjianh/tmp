Researchers at Google's Project Zero informed Symantec of "multiple critical vulnerabilities", which they said were "as bad as it gets".
The vulnerabilities were present in Symantec and Norton-branded security software such as Norton Antivirus.
Symantec said: "Fixes are currently in place, and updates are now available for customers to install."
The vulnerabilities were fixed before Project Zero - which aims to discover security holes in software before they can be exploited by criminals - made the details public.
Researcher Tavis Ormandy said in a blogpost: "They don't require any user interaction, they affect the default configuration, and the software runs at the highest privilege levels possible."
"Symantec dropped the ball here."
Symantec said in a blogpost that it had not seen any evidence that anybody had tried to exploit the security flaws.
"Staying ahead of the threats from attackers requires vigilance and industry-wide information sharing," wrote Adam Bromwich, vice-president of security technology and response at Symantec.
"We remain committed to ensuring our products address today's most sophisticated threats, and we thank the security community for their assistance."
