League One side Oldham Athletic have sacked manager David Dunn after a run of seven league games without a win.

Ex-Blackburn midfielder Dunn replaced Darren Kelly on a temporary basis in September and was confirmed in his first management role after a month.
Assistant manager Dean Holden and first team coach Keith Brown have also left.
BBC Radio Manchester reports that a replacement has been chosen, but terms have yet to be agreed with his current club.
A club statement said they hoped to confirm an appointment by Wednesday afternoon at the latest.
"I would like to place on record my thanks and gratitude to David for his tireless efforts over the past four months under what have been extremely difficult circumstances," chairman Simon Corney told the club website.
Oldham were 19th in League One when Dunn first took charge, but they have since slumped to 22nd, five points adrift of safety.
The 36-year-old, who joined the Latics as a player last summer, won just three of his 20 games in charge.
The team failed to win a home league match under his management, and have not done so since beating Fleetwood in August.
