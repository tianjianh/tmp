The Oak Leafers dominated the first half as they led 0-12 to 0-3 at the interval and held on to win comfortably despite Antrim's second-half revival.
Early points from Peter Hagan, Niall Loughlin and Niall Toner helped Derry lead 0-6 to 0-1 at Celtic Park.
Ronan Hanna saved a Derry penalty before the Oak Leafers were restricted to four second-half points.
Derry hit the first two second-half points to extend their lead to 0-14 to 0-3 as Loughlin pointed his fourth 45 of the contest.
Antrim hit five unanswered points to cut the lead to six as Oisin Lenaghan, Ryan McNulty and Odhran Eastwood (two) were among the scorers.
However, the nearest the Saffrons could get was the five-point margin at the finish.
Fergal McCusker's Derry side will face Donegal at Ballybofey next week.
