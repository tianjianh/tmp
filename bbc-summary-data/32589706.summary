£1m plan to tackle liver disease rise in Wales

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A new plan to tackle the rising number of people with liver disease in Wales aims to improve early detection and speed up referrals.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Liver disease deaths have more than doubled in the past 20 years, largely due to an increase in obesity, alcohol misuse and blood borne viral hepatitis.
The plan, backed by £1m Welsh government funding, hopes to increase clinical expertise in the disease.
It will also encourage people to take more responsibility for their health.
