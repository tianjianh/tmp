Exeter City manager Paul Tisdale says he does not know why his team have been "flat" when trying to come from behind in their last two games.

City were beaten 2-0 at York on Tuesday, having lost 1-0 at Wycombe Wanderers on Saturday in League Two.
"I thought we finished flat again, I don't know why," he told BBC Devon.
"I think we've played very well for the first half, gone a goal down and I didn't see the sort of response I wanted from the team."
The 43-year-old added: "I'm culpable for the result and the players are accountable for their results within."
The two defeats mean Exeter stay in 13th place in League Two, eight points off the play-off places.
"Our season's not over, but we've got to find a way of doing better in the circumstances," Tisdale said.
"I cannot criticise the way the players started the game, there's been no apathy or a lazy starts in either of the two games this week we've lost.
"Both games we've been at it, but somehow we've managed to come away with no points."
