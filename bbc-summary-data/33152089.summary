[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Skomer Island and Marloes Sands are included in travel guide Lonely Planet's Best in Europe 2015 list.
Kent was ranked top, followed by County Kerry in Ireland, with destinations in Germany and Hungary also making the top five.
The guide said Skomer's marine nature reserve and 500,000-strong bird population were among its draws.
It also recommended visiting Marloes Sands - "a mile-long sweep of beach that does a vanishing act at high tide".
