Ward and Lee alternated 10m platform and 3m springboard routines to score a combined 353.85 points from six dives.
Russia's Nadezhda Bazhina and Viktor Minibaev claimed gold (413.30) ahead of Ukrainians Iuliia Prokopchuk and Oleksandr Gorshkovozov (396.40).
"That was incredible," Ward told BBC Sport.
"Having the crowd here supporting in my home pool was a real help and it's a great beginning to what will be a busy competition."
Lee, who performed two 3m dives and one from 10m, added: "I'm not a springboard diver and I only learnt the two dives I did earlier this week, but it's a really good start to the competition."
Ward, who dived twice from 10m and once from 3m, has been in impressive form this year, securing Britain a second 10m platform berth for the Rio 2016 Olympics via the Rio test event in February.
Lee won individual 10m platform gold at the inaugural 2015 European Games in Baku.
Both will compete in their individual 10m platform events later in the competition and will pair up again for the mixed synchronised 10m platform event on Saturday.
Women's 10m platform pair Tonia Couch and Lois Toulson will bid for European honours on Tuesday at the London 2012 Olympic venue.
Olympians Olivia Federici and Katie Clark will compete in the free duet preliminary round.
