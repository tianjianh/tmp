In a thrilling finish Miller stumbled across the line as she edged out American world champion Allyson Felix to win in 49.44 seconds.
Felix, a four-time Olympic gold medallist, took silver in 49.51 seconds with Jamaica's Shericka Jackson third.
Great Britain's Christine Ohuruogu, who won Olympic gold in 2008 and silver in 2012, failed to reach the final.

Miller, 22, finished second to Felix at the World Championships in Beijing in 2015 and had a decent lead with 50 metres remaining.
However, with Felix closing quickly, a fatigued Miller collapsed over the line to win the gold medal by 0.07secs.
Felix, 30, who won the 200m at London 2012 and has three relay gold medals, claimed a third silver medal of her career.
She now has seven Olympic medals - more than any other woman in US history.
Michael Johnson, four-time Olympic gold medallist
"It was a fantastic race and that was an amazing effort from a world-class athlete.
"Allyson Felix will be very disappointed because all she needed was one more metre to really make that happen."
