Relegated National League club Kidderminster Harriers have appointed John Eustace as their new manager.

The 36-year-old former Coventry City, Derby County, Stoke City and Watford midfielder has signed a one-year deal and will take charge in the summer.
"I want someone who can take the club forward towards league football," chief executive Colin Gordon said.
Gordon also said they hope to tie up a deal for Worcester City joint boss Matt Gardiner to work alongside Eustace.
"I've been working hard for a long time to get the perfect team together," Gordon, who has been in temporary charge of the first team since January, told BBC Hereford and Worcester.
"I was very concerned we needed the knowledge of the league we're going into. We've got balance and all bases covered."
Harriers have endured a turbulent season on and off the field, with the departures of Gary Whild and Dave Hockaday as managers and the pressure of severe financial difficulties.

Relegation from the top tier of non-league football was confirmed with Saturday's failure to beat Barrow.
But with the club now of a much firmer financial footing, Gordon says the arrival of Solihull-born Eustace will take them to a new level.
"He's a winner - a brilliant character and one of the best I've come across as a player in terms of coping with pressure," he added.
"It would have been easier for him to have gone somewhere else as a coach and shadowing someone but that's not John's character - he's always been the boss in the dressing rooms he's been in."
Harriers, who are set to be in National League North next season, take on Dover in their final home game of the season on Saturday before finishing the campaign at Southport on 30 April.
