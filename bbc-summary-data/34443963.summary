Norwich 'distressing' Halloween clown ad in ASA probe

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An advert for a Halloween attraction is being investigated by the regulatory body after complaints it is "distressing" and "inappropriate".

The image of a clown promotes PrimEVIL at Lenwade, Norfolk, and can be seen in about 40 locations around Norwich.
PrimEVIL is for over-12s and is made up of themed zones including a haunted hotel and a zombie facility.
The Advertising Standards Authority has received 21 complaints. The organiser said it does not contravene standards.
Goymour Properties, which runs PrimEVIL at the Dinosaur Adventure Park, said its posters had been on display since early September.
However, after receiving complaints, a poster near a school has been moved and another outside a shop was replaced.
The firm has previously told complainants the poster "does not transgress the criteria for such public posters and do not contravene advertising standards".
Martin Goymour told the BBC: "The clown compares very favourably to some of the posters used to promote films, such as the Batman and Joker film.
"We deliberately did not use bloody or gory images."
Johannah Martin complained to Dinosaur Adventure and the ASA after her daughter was upset by a poster which has since been removed in Rackheath.
She said: "If you take your child to a shop to look at horrific masks and outfits, that is your choice. We had no choice but to see this."
The ASA said it had launched a formal investigation following 21 complaints that the advert is inappropriate for outdoor display because it is distressing for children and likely to cause fear or distress.
"We're now liaising with the advertiser to give them the opportunity to defend their ad," a spokesman said.
"We will establish whether the advertising rules have been broken and publish our findings in due course."
