[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
North Ferriby earned a surprise win at Forest Green last weekend but their confidence was knocked after 10 minutes when Morgan Ferrier smashed in his 12th goal of the season.
Boreham Wood pushed on in search of a second to finish their hosts off and they were given a helping hand as Mark Gray turned Bruno Andrade's cross into his own net after 28 minutes.
Robbie Tinkler finished during a goalmouth scramble midway through the second half to give the home side hope of a comeback but Andrade hammered home a minute later to restore Boreham Wood's two-goal lead.
Danny Emerton's own goal from Jai Reason's cross nine minutes from time made it four before Reece Thompson's turn and shot gave North Ferriby a consolation and completed the scoring.
