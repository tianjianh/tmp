Dean Keates: Wrexham prepared to give youngsters a chance

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Manager Dean Keates says Wrexham's youngsters will be given a chance to impress in the remaining nine games of their National League campaign.

Striker George Harry, 19, came on as a substitute in last Saturday's home defeat against Gateshead to make his second senior appearance.
Wrexham are 10th and travel to second-placed Forest Green Rovers on Saturday.
"There's nine games left and I'm more than prepared to give the lads a chance," Keates said.
"Performance wise they've done OK, they've trained well in the early part of the week and we'll see what happens during the rest of the week.
"I'll have a think about it Friday."
Wrexham are 10 points behind fifth-placed Gateshead and Keates acknowledges reaching this season's play-offs would be a tall order.
"We're not looking over our shoulder anymore and it's probably a little too far-fetched to get into the play-offs," Keates said.
"A lot of teams have got games in hand over us and if they pick up points the gap gets bigger."
