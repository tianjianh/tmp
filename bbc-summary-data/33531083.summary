Ardoyne trouble: Man in court on attempted murder charges

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man has appeared in court on two counts of attempted murder after a car hit pedestrians during violence in north Belfast.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A teenage girl and a woman were injured when they were struck by the car during protests on Monday evening.
John Alexander Aughey, 61, of Brae Hill, Ballysillan, said he understood charges of attempting to murder Roisin McGlone and Phoebe Clawson.
Ms Clawson is in hospital with a broken ankle, collarbone and shattered pelvis.
His solicitor said what happened was "highly regrettable and regretted" by Mr Aughey.
The lawyer told the court that Mr Aughey was in poor health and had been treated three times for cancer.
He has a job and is a carer for his wife who is ill. Mr Aughey was supported by family and friends in court.
Objecting to bail, a detective sergeant told the court he believed Mr Aughey's release could lead to widespread public disorder and put him at personal risk of harm.
He was released on his own bail of Â£500 to appear again on 12 August.
The judge imposed a series of restrictions, including a daily curfew from 23:00 BST until 07:00 BST.
Mr Aughey is to live at an address far from greater Belfast which was not made public.
He cannot go into north Belfast, except for medical appointments.
He is not to go within 500m of any parade, procession or protest, he is not permitted to drive a car and he must report to a police station on a weekly basis.
