[SN]TITLE[SN]
Brighton & Hove Albion 2-1 Fulham

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Brighton came from a goal down to beat Fulham and move to within two points of top spot in the Championship.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Fulham went ahead through Kevin McDonald's back-post header in a first half they dominated, with Floyd Ayite and Scott Malone forcing great saves from Albion keeper David Stockdale.
But Sam Baldock's impressive volley from the edge of the box levelled the scores early in the second half.
Glenn Murray secured the points with a cushioned volley from Baldock's cross.
Brighton's win - coupled with leaders Newcastle's first loss in over two months - meant Albion closed the gap on the Mapgies and stayed four points clear of third-placed Reading.
Fulham will be disappointed not to have made more of their good first-half showing as they repeatedly opened up the home side's defence.
But after the break Brighton hit their stride following Baldock's impressive volley from Anthony Knockaert's ball into the box and he later hit the post with a deflected shot from Shane Duffy's header down.
Albion fans did not have to wait much longer for a second, though, as the unmarked Murray, the Championship's second-highest scorer this season, got his 11th goal of the season by sweeping home Baldock's excellent ball.
Brighton manager Chris Hughton:
"They were better than us in the first half because we gave them too much room and we were pleased when half-time came.
"But it shows the character of the team that, despite not being at our best, we were able to fight our way back and that is what you need when you are up there challenging.
"It was an important win because it was unexpected for Newcastle to lose, and one thing I still feel is that the team closest to Newcastle in the table at the end of the season will have a really good chance of going up."
Fulham manager Slavisa Jokanovic:
"It was an ugly afternoon for us. We should be going back to London with some points, but we paid the price for not taking our chances and they were more clinical.
"They made only half-chances - the complete opposite of what we made in the first half. If you don't score, you need to concentrate defensively and we didn't.
"What's important here is that we don't change our attacking philosophy, continue to be brave and believe in each other."
