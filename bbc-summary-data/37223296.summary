A survey by Dogs Trust Bridgend found 52% of people in Cardiff said dog poo was their biggest bugbear in public places - above smoking and littering.
And 40% of those surveyed said they come across dog poo more than once a week, but 57% admitted being "too polite" to confront owners.
The Big Scoop campaign hopes to remind people they could be fined if they fail to clean up after their pet.
Alex Jackson, head of campaigns at Dogs Trust, said: "Dog poo is one of the biggest complaints received by local authorities every year.
"It's important that everyone is aware of how simple disposing of dog mess can be."
A spokesman from Cardiff council said dog fouling has "fallen significantly" since 2015, when a city-wide survey showed it was ranked as a third concern for residents after litter and fast food-related rubbish.
He said the council was changing the way it manages the streets by "bringing different service areas together to improve the cleanliness of all council land in neighbourhoods across the city".
"What is essential is that dog owners play their part and take responsibility for their animals by clearing up after them," the spokesman added.
"The same principle applies for those who litter our city; it isn't acceptable and will not be tolerated. We have to work together to ensure that Cardiff remains clean and tidy."
