Murder accused 'dropped Sameena Imam off' after row

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man accused of murdering his lover last saw her after dropping her off at a supermarket, a court has heard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Mukhtar Hussain, defence counsel for Roger Cooper, told Birmingham Crown Court that prosecutors have deployed "imaginary and erroneous" speculation against his client.
Mr Cooper, 41, and his brother David, 38, deny murdering Sameena Imam, from Cardiff, on Christmas Eve last year.
Ms Imam's body was found buried on David Cooper's allotment in January.
Roger Cooper managed the Coventry warehouse of cash-and-carry firm Costco and was having an affair with Ms Imam, the company's marketing manager.
It is alleged that Mr Cooper, from Coventry, thought he would be sacked if their relationship was exposed.
Mr Hussain said Ms Imam was in a good mood after travelling from Coventry to Leicester with Roger Cooper to the home of his brother.
Jurors were told she suddenly went rigid after a comment made by David Cooper.
Mr Hussain added: "She was angry about the lack of trust and respect and told Roger Cooper that he had crossed the line.
"She was sobbing, crying, shouting, hysterical. She clearly thought, you may think, that her privacy had been invaded when he had asked his brother to go and spy on her."
The court heard Ms Imam demanded to be let out of the car so she could get a taxi.
"He stopped at a Tesco. She gathered up her things and stormed off. That was the last he saw of her," said Mr Hussain.
The case continues.
