The stage play Harry Potter and the Cursed Child officially opened to the public in London on 30 July.
The story is set 19 years after the final book in the series, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows.
In the new play, Harry Potter has grown up and his own kids are going to school.
It's in two parts and lasts more than five hours.
The play has been on for two months already, but last night was its official opening.
Author JK Rowling told the BBC that fans had been "amazing" at not giving away any spoilers from the story.
The script of the play was released on the same night and thousands of people queued outside bookshops to get their hands on it.
