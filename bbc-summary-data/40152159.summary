Police were called to the flat in Fernhead Road, Kilburn, north London just before 01:00 BST on Monday, 29 May.
Officers gained entry and found the body of a 32-year-old woman. She was pronounced dead at the scene.
A 28-year-old man remains in custody at a west London police station, the Metropolitan Police said.
The force said it was called to the flat following "concerns for the welfare of an occupant".
Officers believe they know the woman's identity and her next-of-kin have been informed.
Her death had initially been treated as unexplained but was deemed suspicious after a post-mortem examination, police said.
The examination has now concluded and found the cause of death to be from multiple stab wounds.
The victim was in the Kilburn area on 22 May but detectives said they want to know more about her movements after that.
The motive for the attack may be linked to the victim being a sex worker, police said.
