[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Marian Kotleba won 55.5% of the vote in the run-off against Vladimir Manka from the Smer-Social Democrat party.
Mr Kotleba is a former leader of a banned far-right organisation who now leads the ultra-nationalist Our Slovakia party.
He has previously organised marches against Slovakia's Roma minority.
The now-banned neo-Nazi party which Mr Kotleba formerly led had expressed sympathy for the Nazi puppet state which ruled Slovakia during World War II.
The former teacher has called for Slovakia to withdraw from Nato, which his party brands a "terrorist" organisation.
Of Slovakia's other seven regions, six were won by the social democrats, the party of the Prime Minister Robert Fico, according to AP.
