The Scottish government has offered CalMac Ferries Ltd and Serco Caledonian Ferries Ltd access to data to help the companies form their bids.
CalMac currently runs the Clyde and Hebrides services, which covers almost every route on the west coast.
The new contract will run from 1 October 2016 for up to eight years.
Serco, which operates Northlink ferries to Orkney and Shetland, and CalMac will be asked to submit final tenders in December ahead of the contract being awarded in May next year.
The Scottish government will provide up to Â£1bn in funding to help the winning company improve services and to provide the road equivalent tariff discount scheme.
Transport and Islands Minister Derek Mackay said: "This is another significant step forward for the tender process and moves us closer to awarding the next Clyde and Hebrides Ferry Services contract.
"The award of this contract will be an incredibly important moment for the island communities served by these lifeline ferry services."
He added: "We are committed to delivering the very best deal for all of the communities of the Clyde and Hebrides."
