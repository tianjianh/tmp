The 28-year-old, who has over 100 Premiership appearances to his name, spent the summer playing in Ohio before beginning his trial last month.
Director of rugby Dean Richards said: "We are delighted to have been able to bring him on board full time.
"He is a quality player, he knows this league very well and we look forward to working with him on a permanent basis."
Waldouck came off the replacements bench in Saturday's 58-5 thrashing at Bath.
The Falcons return to action on Sunday when they host Leicester Tigers.
