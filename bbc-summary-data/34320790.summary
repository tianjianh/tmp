England women's manager Mark Sampson says his side need to be even more clinical if they are to compete with the world's top teams.

His comments come after the Lionesses beat Estonia 8-0 in their opening Euro 2017 qualifying match.
Arsenal striker Danielle Carter, 22, scored a hat-trick on her senior England debut at the game in Tallinn.
"We can always score more," Sampson told BBC Sport. "We're not clinical enough in the box."
He added: "We need to make sure we're putting more of these chances away, but we're growing on that as a team."
However, Sampson said Carter was exempt from the criticism.
"Dan was clinical when given the opportunity and produced a very confident performance," Sampson added.
"I mean, how often do you score a hat-trick on your England debut, she'll be remembered for that and it'll go down in the history books, it's certainly something we can add to our hall of fame."
Before the match Sampson had said his current crop of players could win the Euro 2017 tournament in the Netherlands, after claiming bronze at this summer's World Cup in Canada.
But despite the team's goal haul against Estonia on Monday night, he admitted they would have to work on their goal conversation rate if they are to finally lift their first major trophy.
"We're a team who are always going to create chances, but it's about finding the quality to finish," he said.
"We know to be the top nation we've got to be clinical. If the Germans, French or US get a chance, they finish it and we've got to grow towards that over the next 18 months."
