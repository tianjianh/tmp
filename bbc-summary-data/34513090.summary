Detectives investigating the murder of a criminal, once branded "Mr Big", have offered a £50,000 reward in the case.

The cash has been offered for information that leads to Paul Massey's killer being convicted.
Massey, 55, a security boss, was found dead with gunshot wounds outside his Salford home on 26 July.
On BBC Crimewatch, Det Ch Insp Howard Millington said the suspect was seen carrying a weapon "similar to a sub machine gun" towards Massey's address.
Massey, a father-of-five, had managed to call emergency services from his driveway before he died.
"[The suspect] is described as a slim, white male wearing a fisherman style hat, a green long-sleeve top, some form of face covering and dark combat trousers tucked into lace-up boots, said Det Ch Insp Millington, of Greater Manchester Police.
"He was carrying a small black gun, similar to a sub machine gun, toward's Paul's address.
"The offender fired a series of shots at Paul and left the same way he came. That was the last sighting of him."
In July, police said several eyewitnesses saw the gunman approach Massey at about 19:30 BST as he got out of his silver BMW at his home in Manchester Road, Clifton.
Det Ch Insp Millington said a man carrying a torch and an Uzi-style sub machine gun had been seen in the area two days before.
Massey, who was barely 5ft (1.52m) tall, was dubbed Mr Big by the late Salford councillor Joe Burrows at a town hall meeting to discuss civil disturbances in 1992.
He was jailed in 1999 for 14 years, after he stabbed a man in the groin outside a club in Manchester, severing an artery.
Following release from Frankland Prison in County Durham, he was involved in the security business and is believed to have invested in property.
But he was arrested with five others in December 2011 as part of a police inquiry into a Salford-based security company.
Massey claimed officers were conducting a "witch-hunt" against him and denied any wrongdoing.
The following year, he unsuccessfully stood to be Salford mayor.
But, he was still under investigation earlier this year by police in connection with money laundering allegations.
