Royal National Mòd bids farewell to the Western Isles

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Scotland's biggest Gaelic festival has been hailed a success as it bids a fond farewell to the Western Isles.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Royal National Mòd attracted thousands of people for an eight-day celebration of Gaelic language, music and culture.
The event, in its 125th year, was expected to generate up to £2.5m for the local economy.
Prince Charles visited Stornoway on Lewis to watch the celebrations and hand out prizes.
To officially close the celebrations a massed choir made its way from Stornoway Town Hall to the Nicolson Institute for a final choral sing-a-long.
When it arrived representatives from 2017 host town Lochaber received the ceremonial handover from this year's hosts.
The 126th year of the Gaelic festival will take place in Lochaber on 13-21 October next year.
