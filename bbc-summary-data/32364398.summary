Oxfordshire Fire and Rescue Service was called at 16:30 BST on Friday to the Randolph Hotel in Beaumont Street.
It is believed the fire started in a ground floor kitchen and is not thought to be suspicious.
More than 80 people were evacuated from the building and there were no reported injuries. Road closures around the site remain in place on Saturday morning.
Three people were assessed by South Central Ambulance Service at the scene for the effects of breathing in smoke, but did not need further medical attention.
Thick black smoke could be seen coming from the 150-year-old gothic building on Beaumont Street during the fire.
Simon Furlong, assistant chief fire officer at Oxfordshire Fire and Rescue Service, said: "We were working overnight to damp down the embers.
"There was a wedding party, we were liaising with them and we went back in and got the rings and the floor plans.
"Those are small things but it's someone's special day today."
He said the fire had "spread up through some voids" through the building to the roof which would have protected much of the interior.
The extent of the damage is not yet known.
At the height of the fire there were 14 fire engines on site.
A Thames Valley Police spokesman said at the time there were no reported causalities and nobody needed to be rescued.
All guests were accommodated at alternative hotels overnight by Macdonald Hotels, which runs the Randolph Hotel.
