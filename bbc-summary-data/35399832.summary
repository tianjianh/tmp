[SN]TITLE[SN]
Tube strike suspended by RMT to consider offer

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A 24-hour Tube strike planned to start on Tuesday evening has been called off after the Rail, Maritime and Transport (RMT) union agreed to suspend it.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
It follows the Aslef, TSSA and Unite unions calling off their action over pay, the Night Tube and station rotas.
The RMT said the suspension would allow for "further consideration and consultation on the current offer".
However, it said further industrial action was still planned.
The proposed agreement includes a 2% pay rise in year one, RPI inflation or 1% (whichever is greater) in years two and three, and RPI plus 0.25% or 1% (whichever is greater) in year four, plus a Â£500 bonus for staff on lines where the night Tube will run.
General Secretary Mick Cash said: "The union makes it clear that we remain in dispute and the strike action scheduled for February remains on.
"The union is finalising the details for the continuation of that industrial campaign and the on-going fight over the threat to jobs, services and safety."
The Night Tube was due to begin last September but was delayed after the unions raised concerns over pay and conditions and went on strike over the dispute.
Two more 24-hour strikes have been arranged for 15 and 17 February.
An additional strike on 7 February has also been called in a separate RMT row over jobs and station staffing.
