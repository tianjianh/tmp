The 23-year-old, who scored 18 La Liga goals on loan at Eibar last season, will not play in the Swans' Premier League opener at Burnley on Saturday.
The fee for Borja, who has signed a four-year deal and will wear the number 10 shirt, eclipses the £12m the Swans paid for Wilfried Bony in 2013.
"There is pressure, but it is good pressure," said Borja.
"I want to repay the transfer fee paid for me with good performances and results. Hopefully I can score a lot of goals.
"I want to settle and spend several years here.  I am very happy to be here. I am eager to contribute to the success of the team."
The former Spain youth international, whose signing is subject to international clearance, arrives as the Swans look to replace Andre Ayew following his move to West Ham.
Forwards Alberto Paloschi, Eder and Bafetimbi Gomis have also left the club this summer.
Borja, whose full name is Borja Gonzalez Tomas, is an Atletico youth product but made only one senior league appearance for the Champions League finalists.
He joins fellow Spaniard and World Cup winner Fernando Llorente at the Liberty Stadium.
"I was happy with the squad before but I am more happy now because, with Fernando Llorente and Borja Baston, I think we have signed two good players, two very important players," said Swans head coach Francesco Guidolin.
He is the Welsh club's fifth summer signing following Llorente, Dutch defender Mike van der Hoorn, Dutch winger Leroy Fer and Australian keeper Mark Birighitti.
