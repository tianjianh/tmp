A charity is aiming to restore a derelict 19th Century Hull trawler back to sailing condition.

The City of Edinboro was one of the last sailing trawlers, called smacks, to be built in Hull.
It was sold for Â£1 to a charitable trust based in Lowestoft where it currently sits under a giant plastic tent awaiting restoration.
The Excelsior Trust is seeking lottery funding to restore the ship and return it to Hull.
It was unable to say how much the planned restoration would cost, but the trust said the price of the oak timber was estimated at Â£500,000.
The 84ft (26m) long vessel was built in 1884. It fished in the North Sea and the North Atlantic and continued sailing until the mid-1990s.
Trust chairman Geoffrey Copeman said the vessel would require almost a complete rebuild.
"It would be a lasting token for the maritime heritage of Hull," he said.
"It's so worthwhile. She is in the wrong place here. She mustn't be allowed to lie here any longer. She really must be picked up and used."
