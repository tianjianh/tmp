A 0-0 draw against Slovakia and a 3-0 win for Wales over Russia means Hodgson's side will face the runners-up in Group F - potentially Portugal.
England drew 1-1 with Russia before beating Wales 2-1, but failed to score with their 30 shots against Slovakia.
"Soon we will make someone pay, we will score goals one day," said Hodgson, 68.
"You just don't know, the way we are playing I am not frightened of anybody."
Hodgson made six changes for the final group game - including resting captain Wayne Rooney - but did not believe that his rotation cost his side against a stubborn Slovakia.
Jamie Vardy and Daniel Sturridge both started after scoring as substitutes against Wales on Thursday, while Jordan Henderson, Jack Wilshere, Nathaniel Clyne and Ryan Bertrand also came into the starting XI.
Rooney replaced a lacklustre Wilshere 10 minutes into the second half but Hodgson defended his selection of the Arsenal midfielder.
"If people are going to pick on one player that's a pity - Jack Wilshere did fine," said the 68-year-old.
"People were trying to tell me after the Russia game that I should have changed Raheem Sterling and Harry Kane. It was actually four changes from the side which finished the Wales game. You can't have it all ways.
"When did England last come to a tournament and have three such dominant games in a row? We have taken the game to the opposition, we have controlled the play."

The pundits on BBC Sport were not so kind, however - with John Hartson accusing Hodgson of taking Slovakia lightly.
"England totally underestimated Slovakia," the former Wales striker said.
"Six changes was far too many. Wales needed to win against Russia and they made one change."
"Roy Hodgson got it wrong," said Robbie Savage.
"There are too many excuses from the England point of view. You have got to score to win games and they haven't done it.
"They played Slovakia and they can't break Slovakia down - too many excuses."
Former England duo Chris Waddle and Danny Mills were frustrated at the team's failure to break down a side with a packed defence.
England had 65 shots on goal in their three Group B games - but scored just three goals.
"England have got no width. James Milner would give you width, he can do a trick and put a cross in," said Waddle.
"It's easy to say now, but they knew in all three games that people were going to sit deep and frustrate England."
"Why change the two full-backs when Kyle Walker was playing well, Danny Rose was playing well," added Mills.
"Those players will now have 10 or 11 days between games, that's too much."
Former England captain Alan Shearer felt Hodgson missed the chance to build on their last-minute win over Wales.
"I didn't agree with Hodgson making that many changes as I think it is vital to get momentum," said Shearer.
"In Euro '96 we beat Scotland and our confidence was sky high, and then we beat the Dutch 4-1. It was a great opportunity for Roy and this team to do that."
But former England midfielder Danny Murphy defended the display.
"We have played better than a lot of people expected us to and overall I think we are moving forward," he said.
"Finishing second shouldn't harm us that much, there are so many positives to look at from this England side at the moment."
