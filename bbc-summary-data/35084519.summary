Shanshan Feng wins Dubai Ladies Masters by 12 strokes

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Shanshan Feng fired a six-under-par 66 to win the Dubai Ladies Masters for the third time with a tournament record margin of 12 shots.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
China's Feng 26, completed the double of winning the season-ending championship and the Order of Merit on the Ladies European Tour.
The world number six ended on 21 under and Thailand's Thidapa Suwannapura finished second on nine under.
England's Melissa Reid was a shot further back in third.
Derby-based Reid, 28, bogeyed the first hole, but after securing pars across the rest of the front nine, she rallied to sink four birdies on the back nine, for a final round of 69.
However, Feng was in superlative form and after starting the final day with a five-stroke lead after three successive rounds of 67, she extended her advantage when she hit three birdies in four holes from the second.
She managed back-to-back birdies on the 12th and 13th holes and sunk a three-foot putt for a birdie on the last, for a final round of 66.
The huge winning margin eclipsed the previous best for the event - a six-shot triumph by Sweden's Annika Sorenstam in 2006.
Elsewhere, England's Rebecca Hudson (71) and Georgia Hall (73) finished on three-under in joint 12th place.
Dame Laura Davies, (73), who was two shots off the lead at the halfway stage, fell away badly and had to settle for a share of 17th, one ahead of fellow Englishwomen Charley Hull (70) and Liz Young (70).
