But Uefa will have the final say, according to Football Association of Wales project director Alan Hamer.
He expects the roof to be open unless bad weather hits the event on 3 June.
"I've not been made aware of any decisions so I assume that other stadiums didn't have roofs so the roof would be open unless we're told anything different," said Hamer.
The stadium in Cardiff City centre will be the first with a retractable roof to stage European football's showpiece club match.
Asked if there was any possibility the roof might be closed, Hamer added: "Potentially yes, it's a question I've been asked several times by people.
"It's an interesting one, it's Uefa's decision it's their event.
"Normally it's only closed in football when the conditions dictate really.
"I think if we had really poor weather that would put the pitch in jeopardy then clearly it's an obvious decision, but on a day like today where we can see the blue skies we'll see what comes out of it."
Hamer says the FAW hopes bringing the final to Cardiff will lead to an increase in participation.
"We were very clear from the outset that one of our three objectives was to leave a lasting legacy," he added.
"There'd be no benefit for the FAW to stage an event for the kudos. There has to be a tangible legacy.
"For the FAW the true test I guess will be in 2019-2020 (if) are there are more people playing football that were in 2015?
"After the Euros last year we've already made a difference.  With Champions League and Women's Champions league final we'd be disappointed I think if it didn't make a difference.
"That's why we're putting a lot of time into community programmes we're doing.
"We don't have to do these things they're not obligations for the FAW, they're things we choose because of our legacy plan."
