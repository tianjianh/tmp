[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An Essex warehouse worker has taken to brightening up dirty vans by making pictures in the muck, mud and dust.

The artist, known only as Mr Konjusha is 22 and from east London.
His work has been spotted at various locations since he started drawing on the vehicles about three weeks ago. He said he had worked on 10 vans so far.
Mr Konjusha said he was doing this to "put a smile" on delivery drivers' faces. Each creation takes about five minutes, he said.
Most of the vans belong to delivery drivers who turn up at the Basildon Amazon warehouse when Mr Konjusha works.
"Sometimes they can be a bit grumpy in the mornings when I speak to them, so I just thought I'd do something to cheer them up," he said.
"They seem to really like it."
Some of the images resemble a cross between a man and a lion, but he draws "whatever comes to mind, using my fingers and hands".
At first people did not know who was doing it, but Mr Konjusha's fame has spread among drivers and his services are being requested.
"People are asking for a drawing now. They say they're going to save money by not washing their vans and then they can get a picture instead."
