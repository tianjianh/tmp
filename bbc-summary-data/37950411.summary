[SN]TITLE[SN]
BHP Billiton and Vale told to pay to clean up Samarco mine

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A Brazilian court has ordered the two firms behind the Samarco mine to pay an initial $350m to help clean up the country's worst environmental disaster.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The collapse of a dam last November, containing contaminated water and mud at the iron ore mine, killed 17 people.
The payment by BHP Billiton and Vale is to fund initial work, and the firms now have six months to present plans to clean up the remaining waste.
Last month, prosecutors filed homicide charges against 21 people.
They include several Brazilians, two Americans, a South African, an Australian, a Briton and a French man.
The accused were employed at the time by the companies involved - Brazil's Samarco and Vale, and London-listed BHP Billiton.
According to the lead prosecutor in the case, the companies were aware there was a risk of collapse but ignored it.
The companies rejected the charges and said they would defend their staff.
Before the case can go to trial, the charges need to be approved by a judge.
