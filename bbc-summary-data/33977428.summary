Sgt Stephen Chilton used 'excessive force' on youth in custody

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A custody sergeant used excessive force that could have put a suspect's life in danger, a police disciplinary hearing has been told.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Sgt Stephen Chilton is seen using an unapproved neck lock to restrain a youth in a cell in CCTV footage from a Nottinghamshire Police custody suite.
An expert witness said the technique was justified because the suspect tried to attack the sergeant.
Sgt Chilton denies gross misconduct and the hearing continues.
His actions at Bridewell custody suite carried the risk of serious injury or even death, the hearing was told.
The date of the allegation was 9 January 2014.
It is the first time Nottinghamshire Police has held a misconduct hearing in public.
