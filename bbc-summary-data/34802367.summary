The two Greater Manchester Police officers were sent to the home of Fred Thomson and his 95-year-old wife Doris in Middleton.
GMP Middleton tweeted: "Just dealt with a 95 year old couple who called the Police as they were lonely.
"What else could we do but make them a brew and have a chat."
Mr Thomson told BBC North West Tonight how he and his wife enjoyed their company and was grateful for their help.
