[SN]TITLE[SN]
Christmas card message for criminals

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Police are sending specially-designed Christmas cards to prolific offenders, featuring an unpalatable-looking festive meal.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The cards carry the greeting: "Where will you be having Christmas dinner? Basic rooms available with Cheshire Constabulary if youâ€²re naughty not nice!"
They will be hand-delivered to 300 of Cheshireâ€²s most persistent criminals.
Officers will deliver the cards during routine checks on their progress.
Assistant Chief Constable Mark Roberts said: "Whilst the card is light-hearted there is a serious message behind it."
