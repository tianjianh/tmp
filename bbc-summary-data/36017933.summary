The 24-year-old joined the Premiership outfit in February but played only 15 minutes of first-team football.
He had previously been with Indian Premier League outfit Karela Blasters.
Thistle said in a statement: "Antonio German has left the club for personal reasons having had his contract terminated by mutual consent."
The club added that they wished the Englishman well "in whatever he chooses to do next".
Starting his career with QPR, German had loan spells with Aldershot Town, Southend United and Yeovil Town before moving to Stockport County.
He went on to play for Bromley, Brentford and Gillingham, who also sent him on loan to Northampton Town and Aldershot Town.
German made only two late substitute appearances for Thistle, in defeats by Motherwell and Aberdeen, his last outing being on 8 March.
