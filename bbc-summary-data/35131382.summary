The airline will start a daily summer service between the Scottish city and its Charles de Gaulle hub on 27 March next year.
Air France will use an Airbus A318, carrying up to 131 passengers.
The airline said it had decided to introduce services from Glasgow after the airport put forward "a strong business case".
It added that it wanted to position Air France as "a key intercontinental airline for Scotland".
With Glasgow on board, the Air France-KLM Group will offer seven routes from four Scottish airports - including Edinburgh, Aberdeen and Inverness - to Paris or Amsterdam.
Air France-KLM UK and Ireland general manager Warner Rootliep said: "Demand from Scotland continues to grow and Air France has always invested in its Scottish network and local relationships from the region.
"Air France-KLM's Scottish offering will ensure that local businesses are better connected to key markets around the world and we are proud to provide the largest city in Scotland with connectivity to and from key worldwide destinations."
Glasgow Airport managing director Amanda McMillan said: "Air France is a major player in the world of aviation with an extensive route network through its hub at Paris Charles de Gaulle into important global markets such as South America, China, India and Africa.
"The airline's decision to introduce a daily summer service from Glasgow Airport will play a crucial role in encouraging export led-growth, attracting further inward investment and supporting Scotland's burgeoning tourism industry."
Welcoming the announcement, Scottish Transport Minister Derek Mackay said: "The announcement of this new service from Air France is excellent news for Glasgow and for Scotland and further enhances the country's international connectivity."
