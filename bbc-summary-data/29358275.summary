Lorenzo Gallucci, 60, also known as Spud, was hit at just after midnight on Sunday at Splash swimming pool in his home town of Rushden, Northamptonshire.
He died later in the day at the University Hospital in Coventry.
A 25-year-old man from London, who was arrested shortly after the incident, has been bailed.
A statement from Mr Gallucci's family said: "Dad was a much loved character in the area and was well-known socially.
"He was a best friend to many and a drinking buddy to the rest.
"We loved him and would like anyone out there who saw anything to come forward and help the police with their investigation."
Officers are keen to speak to people who were around the Splash car park at the time Mr Gallucci was hit and also those drinking in the nearby band club during the night.
