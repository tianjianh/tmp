[SN]TITLE[SN]
Regiment starts its move from Germany to Bicester

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The first members of a German based Army regiment have taken up their posts at their new home in Oxfordshire.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A contingent of about 30 people from 1 Regiment Royal Logistic Corps has moved to St David's Barracks, in Bicester, to prepare it for colleagues.
The regiment replaces 23 Pioneer Regiment which disbanded last year after around 70 years at the base.
The rest of the 450-strong regiment and their families will relocate in August.
Commanding Officer Lt Col Simon Stevenson told BBC Radio Oxford the era of the British Army being based in Germany was ending and it was now "one way traffic" to the UK.
"We have been in Germany since the late 1960s so this is a real key time for us moving back to the UK and establishing our new home in Bicester," he said.
In order to prepare for the move, head teachers from Bicester and its former mayor Lynn Pratt visited Germany to talk to soldiers and their families about the town and its facilities.
Mrs Pratt said "welcomed" the troops and said "we will do all we can to make the process easy."
23 Pioneer Regiment was disbanded as part of national plans to cut 20,000 army jobs.
