A nursing home in Southampton described as dirty, unsafe and uncaring by a social care watchdog, has been placed in special measures.

The Care Quality Commission (CQC) said Ashley Manor Nursing Home, which has 45 residents, was inadequate and needs immediate improvement.
Deborah Ivanova, of the CQC, said its "woeful shortfall in standards" were "unacceptable".
Theresa Andrews, manager of the home, has not commented on the report.
The CQC said it was taking action to protect the safety of residents, following its surprise inspection in August.
Inspectors found managers had failed to provide care that was responsive to people's needs or well led, and its controlled medicines were not stored safely and had to be taken away by police.
Their report said that despite evidence of "some kindly treatment", care was institutionalised rather than personalised, and not enough staff were on duty at all times.
It described one meal time where "once the meal was completed, all staff left to go on their break, leaving people at risk".
It also said food and fluid intake were not monitored properly, putting people at risk of dehydration or malnutrition.
"No person living in the home consistently received enough fluids to meet their needs," the report states.
Ms Ivanova, interim deputy chief inspector for the south, said: "We have told the provider very clearly where improvements must be made and we are currently using our enforcement powers to ensure this happens.
"We are working closely with local agencies and will continue to monitor the service. We will not hesitate to take further action to ensure people receive the care and support they are entitled to expect."
