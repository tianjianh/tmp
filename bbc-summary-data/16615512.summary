Both acts will also perform at the ceremony, which celebrates the best of UK folk music, at The Lowry in Salford on 8 February.
Now in its 13th year, the awards will be broadcast live on Radio 2, while fans will also be able to watch it live via the BBC Red Button.
The Unthanks lead the nominations with four nods.
The Northumberland singing sisters are up for best group, best live act, best album for Last and best original song for the album's title track.
The Dubliners, who formed in 1962, are one of Ireland's most recognisable folk groups.
McLean, best known for hits including American Pie and Vincent, has amassed more than 40 gold and platinum records worldwide.
"The UK audience has been among the most loyal for over 40 years and without them certainly I wouldn't be considered for this honour, so I thank the BBC and I thank the British public," the singer-songwriter said.
McLean will also perform on Simon Mayo's Radio 2 Drivetime show live from The Lowry ahead of the awards.
Among the other nominees include June Tabor and Oysterband, who are up for best group, best album for Ragged Kingdom and best traditional track for Bonny Bunch of Roses, while Tabor is also nominated for folk singer of the year.
Martin Simpson has three nods for best album, best traditional track and musician of the year.
The Folk Awards ceremony will also be combined with the BBC Radio 2 Young Folk Award, which is given to the most promising young folk artist in the UK.
