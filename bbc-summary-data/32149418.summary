A couple have scooped a £1m lottery prize for the second time - just two years after their first seven-figure win.

David and Kathleen Long, from Scunthorpe, North Lincolnshire, won their first £1m in 2013.
Lottery organisers Camelot said the couple struck lucky again in the 27 March EuroMillions draw.
The firm said it was an "extraordinary situation" for someone to be fortunate enough to win twice.
"As you can imagine, we see winners who win once who are very, very shocked. It must be even more shocking to win twice," a spokesman said.
But former HGV driver Mr Long did not seem too surprised by the windfall.
"I always knew I'd win, even the first time," he said.
"I just had a feeling it was going to be me."
Two years ago Mr Long came close to disaster after his first winning ticket ended up in the rubbish bin after the couple mistakenly thought they had won just £2.70.
The pair have since married after being engaged for 12 years.
Mr Long said the first win had been "fantastic" and had changed their lives.
"Times had been really tough and I had been really ill for three years, unable to work leading up to it," said Mr Long.
"I lasted three days at work and then took early retirement.
"We've had an amazing 18 months, have been able to treat the family, buy a new car and even finally get hitched," he said.
