Greater Manchester Police 'fails to record 38,000 crimes each year'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A police force "fails to record over 38,000 reported crimes each year", a report has estimated.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Greater Manchester Police (GMP) was "under-recording too many reports of crime" including rape, violent crimes and sexual offences, HM Inspectorate of Constabulary (HMIC) said.
The force was rated "inadequate" at recording crime in the HMIC report.
GMP Deputy Chief Constable Ian Pilling admitted "we still need to improve" but they had made "encouraging" progress.
The HMIC assessment, completed in May, also found that GMP:
HMIC said GMP had made "some progress" since an inspection in 2014 but "the force is failing some victims of crime".
It added: "We consider that too often the time taken for officers to attend reports of crime is unacceptable, and that there are too many failures to make the correct crime-recording decision at the first opportunity."
Mr Pilling said: "Whilst there are some unacceptable crime recording failings, many are simply administrative issues and do not mean we have failed the victim."
He said that most of the failures concerning violent crime "were in the less serious categories".
"It is important to recognise that there is nothing in the report to suggest that the integrity of officers and staff is in question."
Tony Lloyd, interim mayor of Greater Manchester and the region's police and crime commissioner, said he was making "major investment", as "one of the most significant reasons for GMP's poor performance is inadequate IT systems".
A new system will be introduced at the force in the next 12 months to "allow officers to record crime at the first contact", Mr Pilling said.
