[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The police have appealed for help in tracing a woman who has absconded after being charged with fraud.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Julia Holmes, who is in her 60s and is known to use false identities, was charged with two counts of fraud by misrepresentation totalling Â£18,000.
She was on court bail but failed to return to court in January 2011. A warrant was issued for her arrest.
Police believe she was most recently in the Galway area of the Republic of Ireland.
However, they have said she could be in any one of a number of places.
She is about 5ft 5ins tall with blue eyes. She has been known to change hair colour and style.
Anyone who has been in contact with her, or thinks they may know where she is, is asked to contact CID at Bangor PSNI Station on 0845 600 8000, or Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111
