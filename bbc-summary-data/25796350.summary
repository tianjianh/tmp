The University of Wales Trinity Saint David (UWTSD) is to buy development land from the Welsh government.
UWTSD, which includes the former Swansea Metropolitan University, said it needed a new city campus despite having other sites.
The deal is subject to the university receiving planning permission.
It will initially buy six development plots on the SA1 Swansea waterfront development covering around 8.5 acres (3.5 hectares).
Ms Hart has also given the university the option to buy nine additional plots totalling more than 11 acres (4.5 hectares).
"Plans for this new campus will contribute to the overall mixed use nature of this major regeneration scheme and should add vibrancy to the overall development," said Ms Hart.
"It will provide the university with the opportunity to develop modern purpose-designed teaching facilities for students and staff and enable it to develop closer links with local businesses for the benefit of the economy."
The university already has a number of buildings in Swansea including campuses at Townhill and Mount Pleasant.
UWTSD was formed in November 2010 through the merger of the University of Wales Lampeter and Trinity University College Carmarthen, before being joined in August 2013 by Swansea Metropolitan University and the Coleg Sir Gar further education college in Carmarthenshire.
Regarding the multi-million pound development plans, UWTSD vice chancellor Prof Medwin Hughes said: "This prime waterfront location in the heart of the city will transform the educational experience for staff and students.
"It will enable UWTSD Swansea to provide a vibrant city experience, connecting academia with innovation, enterprise, businesses and the community.
"We now look forward to working with the city and county of Swansea, as well as our own staff and students, to develop the vision so that we will deliver a positive impact for Swansea, the wider region and for Wales."
The sale of the land is subject to UWTSD achieving planning consent for development incorporating educational facilities and supporting uses.
Meanwhile, Swansea University has started work on its Â£450m campus development.
