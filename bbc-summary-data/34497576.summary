[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Senior figures in British politics have paid tribute to former Conservative chancellor Geoffrey Howe, who has died at the age of 88 after suffering a suspected heart attack.

"He was a very quiet and gentle man. He was also a deep thinker and had huge courage, and in those early Thatcher governments he was, in many ways, the quiet hero.
"The person who put forward those very controversial but vital budgets that got on top of inflation, that helped reform the trade unions.
"He made a big difference to Britain. Very quiet, very gentle but very tough underneath."
Mr Osborne tweeted: "I will miss Geoffrey Howe. He was a great source of advice to me; a quietly-spoken radical, whose bitterly contested budgets rescued Britain."
"I have regarded myself as an acolyte of Geoffrey Howe throughout my career - free market economics, a special conscience, internationalism, pro-European - and I always admired his pleasant demeanour, his unflappability as well as his steely resolve and his very, very good mind.
"He was actually the key figure in delivering the economic revolution in the early 1980s under Margaret's leadership but it was Geoffrey's budgets and Geoffrey's management of the economy that delivered it.
"She didn't have the eye for detail on economic policy that he did and he was very unpopular at the time for doing it but it worked.
"It stopped us from being the economic laughing stock that we were when he took over the Treasury in 1979."
Sir John, who succeeded Lady Thatcher as prime minister, said Lord Howe "was a man whose political convictions, turned into law, transformed our nation".
He added: "Geoffrey has left a benevolent mark on our national life, and I hope in death will receive the credit so often denied him in life."
"He was probably my oldest political friend. We fought alongside each other in 1959 in nearby seats in South Wales but I served with him in government after government and in the Conservative Party all through the time from the 1950s on.
"He was a political rock. He was a rock around which the economics of the early 80s swelled abut failed to dent. He carried huge personal strain for the success of that government. They were very controversial times, controversial policies but Geoffrey was unbending and unyielding but he was a very kind, courteous and gentle man.
"He was a great listener and a master of his brief. You could talk to Geoffrey about anything but you had to be well informed to change his mind."
"He was a truly brilliant chancellor of the exchequer. Behind the quiet unassuming demeanour there was steely determination, dogged consistency and a sense of direction.
"He also had an impish sense of humour. Although he later fell out with Mrs Thatcher, they were for a long period a highly effective partnership, and she could not have succeeded without him.
"He was a Tory with a social conscience, who wanted opportunity for all. He was also a great friend and mentor to me for over 50 years."
"In his six years as foreign secretary he oversaw our international and diplomatic relations during the challenging period at the end of the Cold War, just before the collapse of the Soviet Union.
"He also held strong views on Britain's relationship with Europe and, had he lived, would no doubt have been an enthusiastic participant in the debate we will have in the run-up to the referendum."
Mr Blunt tweeted: "Sad to hear of death of former Reigate MP Geoffrey Howe.
"Gave economic steel to Iron Lady's 1st term. He led cure of the sick man of Europe."
Mr Montgomerie tweeted: "In helping to conquer inflation #GeoffreyHowe was a great friend of the poor. Would be great if obituaries reflected that side to his record."
Mr Corbyn tweeted: "I got to know Geoffrey Howe when he was Foreign Secretary and valued his knowledge and experience. Condolences to Elspeth and family."
Mr Farron tweeted: "Geoffrey Howe has sadly passed away. He was a kind, decent and honourable man. My thoughts are with his family."
"I send my condolences to Lord Howe's family.
"Lord Howe devoted his life to the service of his country and did so with distinction.
"He was not afraid to stand up for what he believed in and famously demonstrated this in his historic confrontation with Mrs Thatcher.
"The end of an era has been marked as in one week we have lost two old foes and great parliamentarians in Denis Healey and now Geoffrey Howe."
"Sad to hear of Geoffrey Howe's death. I worked with him in Britain in Europe.
"He was always a real gentleman who gave me huge support."
Mr Bryant tweeted: "Geoffrey Howe was a thoroughly decent man with a gentle spirit, an enquiring mind and an internationalist outlook. RIP"
