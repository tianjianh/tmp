People on the island of Fanoe, off the south west coast of Denmark, are getting to enjoy the sight of thousands of kites taking to the skies.
Only around 2,700 people live there, but around 5,000 kite flyers from around the world have come for the special event on the island's beach.
The 700m beach is known for being very windy, and there is lots of space to fly the kites which come in many different shapes, colours and sizes.
The special event lasts for three days, ending with a big party where the kites are auctioned for charity.
Watch this...
