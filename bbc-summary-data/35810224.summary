Researchers have been working on the Tugbots for months, but have just recently focused on making them work as a team to maximise the power they can exert.
Six of the bots - weighing less than 100g (0.22lb) in total - exerted a force of 200 Newtons, which was enough to pull the 1,800kg (220lb) vehicle.
