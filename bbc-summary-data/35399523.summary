The 52-year-old quit as assistant manager of Rotherham United on Monday before his switch to Villa Park.
Villa boss Remi Garde said Black, a former Scotland international, "brings a wealth of experience and excellent knowledge of English football".
Villa are bottom of the table with 13 points from 23 games and seemingly destined for relegation.
Black began his playing career under Sir Alex Ferguson at Aberdeen, winning the European Cup Winners' Cup in 1983.
He is fluent in French after spending five seasons playing for Metz.
Black managed both Motherwell and Coventry City, before becoming number two to Steve Bruce at Birmingham City.
