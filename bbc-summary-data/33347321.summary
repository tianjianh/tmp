Lancashire lost six wickets for 51 runs as they were dismissed early for 308, trailing Northants by 130.
Duckett's attacking innings of 88 off 109 balls and Josh Cobb's more patient 52 enabled Northants to set Lancashire 414 to win as they declared on 283-9.
Paul Horton and Karl Brown survived the final six overs to end the day on 19-0 still requiring an imposing 395 to win.
In the morning session Lancashire's lower-order struggled against Steven Crook (3-28), with only Jordan Clark (18) reaching double figures in the lower order.
Despite losing Kyle Coetzer cheaply, Duckett backed up his first innings century with another fine knock to put the hosts on the back foot.
Although Duckett chipped Arron Lilley (3-97) to mid-wicket, Cobb, Crook (37) and last man Olly Stone (35) played some aggressive shots to make sure Lancashire's batted again before the close.
Lancashire will now need to beat their record fourth innings run chase against Northants of 305.
Lancashire captain Steven Croft: "We didn't get any partnerships going with the bat and we wanted to get nearer to their total or even bat past.
"There was some poor shot selection and we found it tough with the bat. We've put some great partnerships together down the order this season and losing six for 50, we're a lot better than that.
"We have to see tomorrow as a fresh day. It's a tough task ahead if we are to chase the runs down. It's there for us to do that and it's there for us to save the game."
Northants captain Alex Wakely: "It was a pretty good day for us. We haven't always played our best cricket when we've come up here so it's nice to be in a good position in this game.
"We wanted to take early wickets and we knew if we got one or two there was always the chance we could get a few more.
"Ben Duckett batted superbly. He has been superb in this whole game and I think he has been the best batsman in the game, He made it look easy."
