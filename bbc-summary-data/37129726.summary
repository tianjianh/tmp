Its branch in Ewloe will close on 11 November and the one in Caergwrle on 9 December.
Alyn and Deeside AM Carl Sargeant has written to HSBC and said banks had a "role to play in their communities and a responsibility towards them".
HSBC blamed a rise in telephone and internet banking for the drop in people using branches.
