The Championship's bottom club stated they had cleared the Â£2.2m debt on Friday and that has now been confirmed.
Funds are available after Dean Holdsworth's Sports Shield consortium and Ken Anderson's Inner Circle bought the club from Eddie Davies.
Bolton are 12 points from safety after the 6-0 loss to Bristol City.
"I can only apologise to all the fans that came down from Bolton," interim boss Jimmy Phillips told BBC Radio Manchester after the defeat.
"It was an embarrassing performance and all the players, who we spoke to after the game, said they were embarrassed as well. All of us know that is no way near good enough.
"There's 24 points left but it's certainly been made far harder by today's performance - not only the points difference but the spirit and damaging effect it's done on the morale and support."
