Rebecca Louise Hellens, 22, from Chatteris, was fatally injured at South Lake Ski School near St Neots when the scooter she was on collided with another at about 11:45 BST on 26 July.
She died a short while later in hospital, Cambridgeshire Police said.
The district council is considering whether to investigate the incident.
The collision happened at the water sports centre which has three lakes.
One of these is an 8.5 acre lake solely for use by people with their own sea scooter machines, its website says.
Cambridgeshire Police were initially alerted to the incident by the ambulance service which had been called to a young woman reported to be in cardiac arrest after a collision.
Miss Hellens was taken to Bedford hospital where she died.
A spokesman for Huntingdonshire District Council said they were "liaising with the management of the club, Cambridgeshire Police and the Health and Safety Executive to determine the need for an investigation under the Health and Safety at Work Act".
An inquest into Miss Hellens' death was opened by the Cambridgeshire coroner and adjourned until 7 January.
