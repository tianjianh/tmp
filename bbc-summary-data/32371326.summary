Hampshire Police confirmed the discovery, but said the body had not been formally identified.
The family of Stephen Taylor, 54, of Newbroke Road, Gosport, has been informed.
A coastguard search was sparked when Mr Taylor, an experienced kayaker, failed to return home after leaving Lee-on-the-Solent on Saturday.
He was heading to Lepe beach in a blue kayak.
