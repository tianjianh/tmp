Jack Muldoon slotted the home side ahead when Matt Rhead knocked down Terry Hawkridge's cross.
Half-time substitute McQuilkin fired a free-kick past Lincoln goalkeeper Paul Farman to draw the Harriers level.
The midfielder then headed in Harriers' 83rd-minute winner after Farman had parried Ben Whitfield's initial effort.
Colin Gordon's Harriers, who had lost their previous four games, stay bottom, 11 points adrift of safety with eight games to go.
Harriers boss Colin Gordon told BBC Hereford & Worcester:
"We are standing on the precipice, we know that. It's either going to happen or it's not but there is nothing to fear.
"You've got to be professional, do the job and be as tough as them and you've got to be brave. We controlled the game and showed we are a good team.
"I said to them at half time that I don't know what they fear. I believe in them absolutely, so why have they got this fear about them?"
