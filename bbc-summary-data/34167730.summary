A charity football match has raised more than £35,000 for families affected by the Bosley mill explosion.

Four workers were killed in the blast when a huge explosion reduced Wood Treatment Ltd to rubble in July.
Former professional footballers, including ex-England winger Trevor Sinclair, took part in the game at Macclesfield Town.
Organiser Keith Innes said: "The last few weeks have been tough, the heart of the community has been ripped out."
He added: "The community has always been together - anybody will give anything for each other - but this has really cemented exactly what it is like to be from Bosley."
Will Barks, Derek Moore and Dorothy Bailey were identified as victims, but Jason Shingler, 38, remains missing.
The inquest into Mr Moore's death was opened and adjourned last month.
Fifty workers at the mill have been made redundant.
More than £100,000 has been raised so far by The Bosley Disaster Appeal Fund.
Sinclair, who scored a goal, was joined by ex-Man City players Paul Dickov, Shaun Goater and brothers Ian and David Brightwell, along with ex-Coronation Street actor Scott Wright and several Macclesfield Town players.
