The front bicycle light is being tested by the Santander cycle hire scheme on 250 of its bicycles in the capital.
It is designed to help make riders more visible to other road users.
BBC London's transport correspondent Tom Edwards speaks to Emily Brooke, the woman behind the Blaze Laserlight, and also interviews James Mead on behalf of the cycle hire scheme.
