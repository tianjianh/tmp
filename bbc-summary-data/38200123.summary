The occupants of the car managed to escape from the vehicle before it was hit at Cleghorn level crossing in Lanark on Saturday evening.
It was struck by the Virgin service from Preston to Glasgow, which was carrying around 60 passengers just before 19:00.
The incident caused widespread disruption and services were re-routed as a result of the collision.
British Transport Police (BTP) said its officers were investigating how the vehicle came to be on the tracks.
In a statement published on Saturday, a spokesman for BTP said: "Just after 18:46 we were called to Cleghorn level crossing in Lanark following reports that a car was struck by a train.
"Officers from British Transport Police and Police Scotland are on scene and are being supported by the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service.
"Fortunately, all occupants of the vehicle were able to exit before it was struck by the train. There are no reported injuries at this stage.
"Our priority is to ensure the safety of everyone on board the train and the vehicle's occupants and look to understand how the car came to be on the tracks."
BTP also said the Rail Accident Investigation Branch and Office of Rail and Road have been notified.
