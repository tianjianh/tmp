[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A pharmaceutical company in Flintshire is to close following with the loss of 66 jobs.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Quantum Pharma Plc said NuPharm would cease trading at Deeside Industrial Park by the end of December due to "significant cash losses".
The firm took over NuPharm in July last year.
It said despite continued investment, NuPharm was "not capable of becoming an earnings enhancing business", and closure was the only option.
In a statement, it said: "Other alternatives were examined but were not considered viable.
"The board believes that the best available course of action is to commence a closure of the business in an orderly fashion."
NuPharm makes products for the pharmaceutical and healthcare industries.
