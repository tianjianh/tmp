Voices rise in Barnstaple to save north Devon theatres

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Demonstrators have marched through the streets of Barnstaple in protest at the closure of two north Devon theatres.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Both the Queen's Theatre in Barnstaple and Landmark Theatre in Ilfracombe closed without warning earlier this week.
The charitable trust running them went into administration.
More than 100 casual and full time staff have lost their jobs with the closures.
Sarah Cadogan-Wright, who organised the demonstration, said: "I think a march like this always does a lot of good because unless people raise their voices then decisions get made and ultimately it's the man on the street that suffers."
North Devon Theatres said attendances at the venues had dropped 20% over the last year, council grants were being cut and the closures had been made with "great regret".
North Devon Council is holding a public meeting at Cedars Inn, Barnstaple, on 1 February to discuss ways of saving the theatres.
