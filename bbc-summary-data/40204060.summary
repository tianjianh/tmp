Yusuf Sonko was found injured in Tagus Street, Toxteth, on Friday evening and later pronounced dead.
The bikes, which police said had been damaged by fire, were found on the corner of Corinto Street and Upper Stanhope Street on Wednesday night.
Two people have been held on suspicion of murder in connection with the death.
Det Ch Insp Mark Tivendale, of Merseyside Police, said: "I would appeal to anyone who lives in the area around Upper Stanhope Street who may have seen anyone riding these bikes in the past few days, or seen anyone acting suspiciously on the patch of land at the junction of Corinto Street to get in touch.
"I would also ask any taxi drivers with dash-cam footage or anyone with CCTV footage that may be relevant to get in touch."
He added officers were "keeping an open mind into the motive for the shooting" and renewed an appeal for witnesses to contact them.
A post-mortem examination found Mr Sonko died from a single gunshot wound to the head. Police have said they believe the attack was targeted.
A 21-year-old man arrested on suspicion of murder has been released on bail pending further inquiries.
A 17 year-old boy, also held on suspicion of murder, has been released under investigation.
