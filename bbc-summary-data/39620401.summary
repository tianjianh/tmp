Attack on two Latvian men in Coalisland treated as hate crime

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An assault on two Latvian men in County Tyrone is being treated as a hate crime, police have said.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The pair, in their 30s, were attacked by a group of men outside a bar in Coalisland's Main Street shortly before 21:00 BST on Sunday.
They suffered cuts and bruises as well as possible facial fractures in the attack.
Police have appealed for anyone who witnessed the attack to get in contact with them.
Linda Dillon of Sinn FÃ©in said the attack was disgraceful and those responsible did not represent the people of Coalisland.
