Adeyemi, 24, spent last season with Leeds United on a similar deal where he scored two goals in 24 games.
The ex-Norwich trainee joined the Bluebirds on a free transfer from Birmingham in August 2014 but has made just 23 appearances, scoring once.
"He's got real good energy and athleticism," boss Alan Stubbs told the club website.
Meanwhile, midfielder Chris Dawson, 21, has joined Norwegian side Viking FK on loan until January with an option of a permanent move.
