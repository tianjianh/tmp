[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Alexander Toth, 45, from Torquay ambushed his estranged wife Brigitta as she walked to work on 23 March.
He stabbed her three times in the back, smashed her skull with a hammer, then stabbed himself.
Mrs Toth, 41, remains in a neurological unit.
Judge Graham Cottle said: "Your marriage had deteriorated to a point where it was effectively over and that was something you were not prepared to accept.

"I am quite satisfied that before the day in question you came to the conclusion you would revenge the wrong which you perceived she had done to you, and that you would do so by killing her."
Exeter Crown Court heard that Toth had become obsessed with revenge and had been planning to kill his wife "for some time".
Mrs Toth is receiving therapy at a specialist unit to try to restore her speech and mobility but will never be able to live independently again.
Judge Cottle told Toth: "You have two children upon whom the burden of caring for their mother will fall. That is an awful and terrible responsibility for two people who are so young and who wish to make their own way in life."
After the trial, Det Sgt Chris Rooney said: "Toth's guilty plea will prevent the members of the family having to attend a trial and relive those horrific events, and we welcome the court's sentence."
