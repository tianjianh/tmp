Natural Retreats wants to make improvements to the restaurant, offer conference space and increase its facilities for making snow.
The company has started a consultation on its plans.
The ski centre in the Cairngorms National Park is owned by Highlands and Islands Enterprise (HIE).
Natural Retreats has released a series of architects' impressions of the new look.
A new day lodge with food outlets, shops and a creche and an "adventure zone" have been planned.
Highland Council has been informed of the proposals.
Natural Retreats owns holiday accommodation at a number of locations in the UK and elsewhere.
It has a 25-year lease for the running of CairnGorm Mountain.
Last year, the company said it would invest more than Â£6m in the resort over five years.
