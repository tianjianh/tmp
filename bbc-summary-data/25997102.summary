Downing Street is ousting non-Conservative supporters from key public body posts, according to the outgoing chair of schools inspectorate Ofsted.

Baroness Sally Morgan told the BBC she was the victim of a "determined effort from Number 10" to appoint more Tories.
The Labour peer has not had her term of office - due to end this month - renewed, but will stay on until a successor takes over in the autumn.
A Number 10 spokesman stressed that appointments were made on merit.
He said: "Michael Gove has thanked Sally Morgan for her effective and long service as chair of Ofsted.
"The decision not to reappoint her was his decision. This government appoints people on merit.
"For example, Sally Morgan was herself appointed under this Government and  the former Labour adviser Simon Stevens is about to take up the post of Chief Executive of NHS England.
"We have also asked former Labour cabinet ministers to carry out independent reviews on key public policy issues, including Alan Milburn on social mobility and John Hutton on public service pensions."
But speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Baroness Morgan said: "There is an absolutely determined effort from Number 10 that Conservative supporters will be appointed to public bodies."
There had been a "strong and co-operative relationship" between herself, ministers and officials, Baroness Morgan said, denying there had been any kind of "falling out".
Baroness Morgan said her removal was part of a pattern which had seen a series of non-Conservative supporters on bodies like the Arts Council and the Charity Commission replaced with loyal Tories.
She said the impetus behind the appointments appeared to come from No 10.
She told Radio 4's Today programme: "I really do think it's just I am the latest of a fairly long list of people now who are non-Conservative supporters who are not being re-appointed."
Baroness Morgan, a former close aide to Tony Blair, said there was "absolutely a pattern", adding: "I think it's extremely worrying."
She was appointed by the coalition in 2010 as head of the education inspectorate for England.
Baroness Morgan said she believed the move was not specifically against Labour, but against those who did not support the Conservatives, and added: "I think there's a lot of concern about it.
"Often they are people who have been working really well with their organisations and, indeed, with their host departments, so I do think this is coming from Number 10.
"I don't think it is coming from individual departments."
Baroness Morgan told Radio 4 the issue needs to be looked at by the cabinet secretary, the most senior civil servant,  and the cabinet office.
"One of the really important things about public appointments is that they are made on the basis of merit and they are seen to be transparently made," she said. "I think there's something going on in the centre that's mitigating against that."
Education Secretary Michael Gove has not commented on allegations in the Independent he was dismissing Baroness Morgan but praised her contribution.
Mr Gove said: "She has brought great knowledge and insight, leading the board strongly through a period of significant change, both managing the smooth transition when there were changes in chief inspector, and leading the reforms to the inspectorate and its work.
"I hope that she continues to play an active role in helping to shape the education landscape to improve standards for all children and young people."
The education secretary earlier denied claims by Sir Michael Wilshaw, the chief inspector of schools in England, that the Department for Education had briefed against Ofsted.
Shadow education secretary Tristram Hunt told the BBC: "I think the prime minister has a particular problem with women in public life from non-Conservative backgrounds."
Mr Hunt said the Conservative party had shown "a worrying lack of plurality in public appointments".
He added: "Downing Street are very keen to get their own people onto public boards and the secretary of state for education should have stood up for Sally Morgan.
"He should have stood up for a good public appointment rather than give in to party political games from Downing Street."
In a statement, Ofsted said Baroness Morgan's term of office "has been extended until the autumn of 2014 by the secretary of state while the process is put in place to find a successor".
The Independent also reported that the deputy prime minister has complained to the cabinet secretary about Conservatives making "party political" appointments.
