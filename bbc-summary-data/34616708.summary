Trevor Bolton, 78, from Clacton-on-Sea, Essex, targeted his victims over 20 years at the former Carmel College.
Bolton was convicted of 16 counts of indecent assault, six counts of indecency with a child and three other sexual offences.
The sentence was welcomed by police and one of his victims.
Peter Gluckstein, 56, from London, was one of two men who waived anonymity after Bolton's conviction.
"I'm stunned but glad. I feel even more vindicated," he said after the sentencing.
Adrian Foster, chief crown prosecutor for Thames and Chiltern Crown Prosecution Service (CPS), said Bolton lived in a flat above the boys' dormitories.
"He abused his position of trust and took advantage of his status to systematically prey on vulnerable or homesick young boys by inviting them to his flat to watch TV and smoke."
Mr Foster praised the courage of victims in exposing Bolton's behaviour.
"The emotional impact, on the victims and their families, of the abhorrent actions of this man is impossible to quantify," he said.
Det Con Trish Coyne, of Oxfordshire child abuse investigation unit, said: "The length of these sentences reflect the severity of Bolton's crimes.
"While the offences took place some time ago, and despite the fact that Bolton's eight victims are successful individuals, every single one of them has admitted the offences have had an impact on them well into their adult lives."
Carmel College was founded in 1948 and closed in 1997
It was originally based at Greenham Common, Berkshire, but moved to Mongewell Park in 1952
During its life the school was attended by about 4,000 students - a third from overseas
A 1973 edition of the Observer described it as "the Jewish Eton"
