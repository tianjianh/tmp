Bradby, ITV's political editor and a screenwriter, came to prominence when he interviewed the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge on their engagement.
He said the opportunity to lead the bulletin "into a new era is a unique and incredibly exciting challenge".
Austin will move to the 18:30 news, while Etchingham will "remain a key figure" on the later bulletin.
'More sleep'
Etchingham - fresh off the recent election coverage - will host the bulletin when Bradbury is unavailable, with international affairs editor Rageh Omaar also stepping in occasionally.
Austin, who will co-host the 18:30 bulletin with Mary Nightingale, said he was looking forward to "a bit more sleep".
"After eight really enjoyable years on News at Ten, I leave the show in great shape, as current RTS Daily News Programme of Year, and in good hands," said Austin.
ITV news editor Geoff Hill said he was "thrilled" with the new line-up. "It builds on our success and signals the start of an exciting chapter for ITV News.
"We're blessed with an incredibly talented group of presenters who will add tremendous value to our award-winning journalism."
Bradby, who has worked for ITV News for the past 25 years, also works as a screenwriter. He wrote the 2012 Clive Owen film Shadow Dancer and worked on the recent ITV mini-series The Great Fire.
