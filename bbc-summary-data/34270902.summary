It is the first time since 2006 a Welsh artist has made the cut.
Mr Williams, based in Caernarfon, Gwynedd, draws on his own experiences to develop his sculptures.
In 2015, the prize was won by Theaster Gates who vowed to share his £40,000 prize with the other shortlisted artists. The next winner will be announced in 2017.
"It feels great to be part of an international exhibition like Artes Mundi with fantastic artists and to be doing it in Wales makes it even better," said Mr Williams.
"Artes Mundi brings artists from the rest of the world into a country and arts community that I'm really proud to be an artist in".
