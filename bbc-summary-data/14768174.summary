[SN]TITLE[SN]
Library survey starts in Bath and North East Somerset

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Library users in part of Somerset are being asked to critique their service as part of a five-year plan.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Bath and North East Somerset Council wants to review its services to see how they can be improved.
Councillor David Dixon said the results would help the service "move forward" but it was "not going out in this consultation with a view to close libraries".
Residents can complete the survey at their libraries or online.
Mr Dixon said: "We're not in the same situation as many other councils who are looking at drastic cuts and closing libraries.
"We're looking to make sure that the library service we've got is what people actually need and what they want."
Mr Dixon said the survey results would likely provide "efficiencies" as there was a focus on "moving forward" and catching up with technology.
"We're looking at innovative ways to deliver a better library service to people."
Meanwhile library users in the Somerset County Council area are waiting to find out if funding will be withdrawn from 11 libraries in the county.
The council's decision has gone to a full judicial review being brought about jointly with campaigners in Gloucestershire who are trying to save 10 libraries that are under threat.
