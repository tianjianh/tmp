A so-called "head shop" that sells legal highs has been shut after anti-social behaviour complaints.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Gypsy Kings CafÃ© in Commercial Road, Portsmouth, was issued with a closure notice on Tuesday and ordered to close for three months on Thursday.
Police were granted an order by magistrates under the Anti-social Behaviour, Crime and Policing Act 2014.
PC Dan McGarrigle said he believed anti-social behaviour in the area was related to the sale of "legal highs".
He described them as "psychoactive substances".
"The anti-social behaviour related to this premises has had a detrimental effect on the local community and has had a negative impact on individuals, families and businesses," he said.
Portsmouth City Council and Hampshire Constabulary worked together to secure the closure of the shop.
Simon Hayes, Police and Crime Commissioner for Hampshire, said: "The magistrates have made the right decision here to close the Gypsy King's head shop. It sold products that endanger the lives of anyone who takes them. "
"These substances should not be available at all, let alone on our High Streets."
