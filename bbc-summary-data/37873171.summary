Corrie Mckeague, 23, disappeared after a night out in Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk, on 24 September.
Tony Wringe said officers involved were a "major investigation team in name not function" and accused Suffolk Police of withholding information from the family.
The force said officers continue to consider "every possibility".

Writing on the Help Find Missing Corrie Mckeague Facebook page, Mr Wringe said: "There is a lack of trust towards the media management approach the police have employed to date, including coming out immediately after Corrie disappeared, emphatically claiming there was no third party involvement -  clearly not a statement supported by the evidence then or now."
Mr Wringe, who has a background in counter terrorism, criticised police for not searching a landfill site in Barton Mills, where Mr Mckeague's phone was traced.
He added: "It is our summary that Corrie has disappeared against his will, a third party is involved.
"There are numerous leads that have not been followed up and evidence that has not been effectively processed.
"The investigation team's claim that this is an "intelligence-led operation" has been a euphemism for cost constrained," he added.
A police spokesman said a huge area had been searched, hundreds of hours of CCTV footage had been viewed, dozens of people had been traced and spoken to but "there is still not a clear line of inquiry as to what may have happened".
He added they are "aware they can't provide the answers the family need but they all share the same aim, to find Corrie".
