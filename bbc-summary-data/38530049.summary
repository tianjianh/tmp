[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Perthshire-based construction group Hadden has posted a rise in turnover and profits following a "satisfactory" year.

The company said turnover rose by more than 26% to almost £22.4m in the year to the end of March 2016.
Pre-tax profits climbed by more than £110,000 to £793,000.
Aberuthven-based Hadden said its results had been boosted by a general improvement in construction industry activity.
In its accounts published at Companies House, the company said: "The speculative housing sector's recovery has allowed the company to progress completion of dwellings at their existing land bank, and purchase a further site for mixed housing development."
It added: "The results for the year and the financial position at the year end were considered satisfactory by the directors who expect to maintain the company's position in the foreseeable future."
Hadden has worked on a number of high-profile projects in recent years, including the internal refurbishment of Hutcheson's Hall in Glasgow's Merchant City and restoration of the art deco Birks Cinema in the centre of Aberfeldy.
Current projects include a new £3m community hub in East Calder, West Lothian, and a luxury apartment development at the former Eastern Primary School in Broughty Ferry.
