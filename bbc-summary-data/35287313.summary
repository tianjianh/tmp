Thirteen people were hurt when the single-decker hit the building used by Guide Dogs UK in the centre of Peterborough on Christmas Eve.
The charity has moved into an office in the Orton Southgate area of the city.
Helen Sismore, community engagement manager, said: "We should be back in our repaired office by April."
The bus went through the bay windows on the front of the charity's regional office on Broadway.
Passengers had a variety of minor injuries but no-one was injured in the office where three people were in back rooms.
Ms Sismore said: "We heard and felt the crash and it was horrific and the timing on Christmas Eve didn't help.
"We've been working using laptops wherever we can find wi-fi, such as our homes, cafes and libraries.
"No clients have suffered because we've been in telephone contact using our mobiles and we've had a lot of support from our volunteers and the local community."
She said the repair of the rented Broadway offices was being covered by the landlord's insurance and they were renting the temporary office on Cully Court at the market rate.
