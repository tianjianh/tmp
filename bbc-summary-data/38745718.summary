[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Lyndon Nowell, 28 when he went missing, was in the Coronation pub on Childwall Valley Road, Liverpool between 20:00 and 20:45 on 24 January 2002 before leaving in his silver Ford Focus.
His burned-out car was found hours later in Swinton, Greater Manchester.
Anybody with information about the father-of-two is asked to call police.
Mr Nowell had left his home in Kirkdale, Liverpool at about 17:30 GMT.
His car was discovered in Blantyre Road, Swinton in the early hours of 25 January.
Det Insp Nick Price said Mr Nowell's disappearance was "sudden and unexpected" and his family was still suffering.
He added: "The question still remains as valid today as it was on 24 January 2002 - Why would a man of his age with a young family and no apparent problems walk out of a pub and vanish into thin air?
"It has previously been suggested that Lyndon may have gone to visit someone in Manchester on the night he disappeared."
Anyone who knows where he went after leaving the Coronation pub, or anyone who saw the silver Ford Focus in the Swinton area shortly before 01:00 on 25 January 2002, is urged to contact police.
Mr Nowell, who would now be 43, is described as black, 6ft 3in tall and well built.
He was last seen wearing beige Armani trousers and a red or maroon top.
