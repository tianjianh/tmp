James Forrest says the Celtic players have taken a huge lift from the news that boss Brendan Rodgers has committed his future to the club.

Rodgers, who has won the League Cup and Premiership title in his first season in Glasgow, signed a new four-year deal on Friday.
And Forrest says the news has further boosted the feel-good factor at Celtic.
"It's been a pleasure to work with him and hopefully we can continue it for years to come," the winger said.
"We just heard on Friday about the manager's new contract and all the boys are delighted.
"He didn't tell us, we only heard as we left training. But all the boys are happy and so are the staff.
"A few of us have signed a new deal this season so for him to sign up for the same length of time, it just continues the buzz about the place right now.
"We don't want to stop now, we want to keep going. It's exciting what we can achieve under him, now that he's committed long-term.
"Since he came in, it's been perfect up until now. But he's always working on us, he doesn't want to stop. That's great for the players and the fans."
Rodgers watched his Hoops side extend their unbeaten domestic run since the start of the season to 39 games with a comfortable 3-1 home win over Kilmarnock on Saturday.
Kilmarnock's Jordan Jones had levelled after Stuart Armstrong gave Celtic the lead, but Scott Sinclair popped up with Celtic's second before Forrest nodded in the third - the first headed goal of his career.
The win took Celtic on to 90 points in the Premiership, with a final game before the split away to Ross County next Sunday before their Scottish Cup semi-final against Rangers on 23 April.
