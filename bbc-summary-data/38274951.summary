The crash happened near a meat factory on the A5 Doogary Road just after 08:00 GMT on Saturday. The road has now reopened.
SDLP MLA Daniel McCrossan said the community was shocked by what had happened.
"There are no words to justify just how devastating, awful and heartbreaking the news is today," he added.
"Two families, an entire community deeply devastated by the reality of these people losing their lives by what is, and continues to be, an extremely dangerous road."
Speaking after the collision, Assistant Chief Constable Alan Todd appealed to all road users to drive carefully: "Our statistics illustrate that there is an increased risk of collisions during the holiday period," he said.
"To date this year, unfortunately, 66 people have been killed on our roads.
"Over the Christmas holidays we will have additional police resources on the roads across Northern Ireland and we will be liaising closely with our An Garda Siochana Traffic Corps colleagues in the border counties."
