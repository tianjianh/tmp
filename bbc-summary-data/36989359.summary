Wolves: Kevin Thelwell to become sporting director as Jez Moxey leaves

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Wolves have promoted Kevin Thelwell to become sporting director, to replace departing chief executive Jez Moxey.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Wolves have announced that Moxey is to leave the club on the eve of the new Championship season, rather than work out his full intended notice period.
He was due to stay on for a three-month handover of transition, following the arrival of Chinese owners at Molineux.
But he will now take up his new position with Norwich City sooner than expected, beginning his role on Monday.
Moxey's existing role of Wolves chief executive has been split into two parts.
Thelwell's promotion from the role of head of football development and recruitment at Molineux forms part of a reorganised structure under the club's new owners, the Fosun Group.
Laurie Dalrymple, formerly the club's head of commercial, becomes managing director and is responsible for all off-the-field activities.
Both will report to Wolves director Jeff Shi, who has so far been the public face of Fosun.
Andrea Butti, previously Monaco assistant technical director and Inter Milan press and team manager, becomes team general manager and will report to new head coach Walter Zenga, while Stefano Cusin has been confirmed as head coach.
Wolves kick off their third successive season in the Championship at Rotherham on Saturday.
