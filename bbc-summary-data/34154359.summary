The Claudy man was found dead in the city centre on Sunday 23 August.
The robbery occured at around 02.34 BST on Sunday 23 August on the Derry walls at Bank Place leading to Foyle Street.
"We do not believe Conall's death was a result of a crime, however, we believe that his wallet was stolen before his death," said Det Insp Conor McStravick.
He added that no wallet was found on Mr Kerrigan, but was found sometime later after extensive searches.
Mr Kerrigan had been at the Metro Bar in the city earlier, but left and was later seen on the city walls.
He was last seen on the walls near Foyle Street at around 03.03 BST on 23 August.
