Nicola Brown, 43, from Portsmouth, was also found guilty of two counts of causing grievous bodily harm with intent to her son, Jake.
His father, Jason Brown, 44, was found not guilty of causing or allowing the death of a child.
Winchester Crown Court was told Jake had previously suffered 17 broken ribs.
As the verdicts were delivered, Nicola Brown shouted: "I didn't do it. I didn't do it."
Jurors heard how Jake died on 19 December 2014 due to "an impact to the head requiring substantial force".
The court was played a 999 call made by Brown, in which she said he had stopped breathing while she was feeding him.
She told the operator he had fallen out of his Moses basket the day before.
The broken ribs had been caused by an adult squeezing him, the court was told.
Brown had not informed her doctor she was expecting Jake and social services were alerted to the "concealed pregnancy".
Nigel Lickley QC, prosecuting, said Jake had been born in "unusual circumstances" at the couple's former home in Agincourt Road.
He said: "He arrived into this world by falling into and being caught by the pyjamas or tracksuit bottoms of Nicola Brown."
He said Brown, later of Seymour Road, had a "short fuse" and her attack on Jake was motivated by "anger".
Det Supt Scott MacKechnie said: "The treatment of newborn Jake by his own mother is very upsetting and shocking.
"This has been a complex investigation piecing together evidence of what occurred during Jake's 19 days of life, to establish how he died and who was responsible."
Portsmouth Safeguarding Children's Board confirmed a serious case review would be held into Jake's death.
Sentencing was adjourned to a date to be fixed.
