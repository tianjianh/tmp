Pro12: Zebre v Connacht match abandoned after storm

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Saturday's Pro12 match between Zebre and Connacht was abandoned because of torrential rain in Parma, Italy.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Zebre had been leading 22-10 against the champions at half-time but the second half did not start as conditions at the Lanfranchi Stadium  got worse.
Centre Tommaso Boni, blind-side flanker Maxime Mbanda and open-side Jacopo Sarto crossed for the Italians.
Full-back Tiernan O'Halloran went over for Connacht who are still seeking their first points of the season.
The referee initially suspended the game as pools of water had formed on the pitch.
With the heavy rain showing no sign of easing, the decision was taken to call the match off.
