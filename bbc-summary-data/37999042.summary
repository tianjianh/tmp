Lifelong restriction for serial rapist Jamie Rudling

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man who raped two women - one of them while he was on probation for grooming two teenage girls - has been handed a lifelong restriction order.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Jamie Rudling, 28, from Dunoon, repeatedly raped one victim, between 2003 and 2011, at an address in Argyll.
He also raped a 22-year-old woman while she was asleep, in Argyll in 2014.
At the High Court in Glasgow, Rudling was jailed for a minimum of three years and six months and told he may never be judged safe enough to be released.
Passing sentence, judge Judge Lady Carmichael told Rudling: "You present a high risk to the public at large if you are at liberty.
"You were sexually offending while on an extended sentence which was intended to protect the public."
Lady Carmichael told Rudling that he showed a pattern of sexual offending from his teenage years and added: "It is significant that your pattern of serious sexual offending became as excessive as it did over a significant period."
She added: "I am imposing a life-long restriction order. It is possible you many never be released. It will be up to the parole board to decide if he is ever released."
Rudling was given three years probation in March 2010 after being convicted of attempting to rape a sleeping woman.
He was also jailed for 28 months at Ayr Sheriff Court in November 2011 and placed under supervision for two years after he persuaded two teenage girls to expose themselves on a webcam.
He also arranged to meet one for sex at Braehead Shopping Centre in Renfrewshire.
Following his conviction, Rudling's counsel unsuccessfully argued for him to be given an extended sentence rather that a life-long restriction order.
Lady Carmichael dismissed imposing an extended sentence saying: "That has been tried already and there was re-offending."
