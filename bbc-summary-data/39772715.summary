[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Graham, 31, suffered a head injury 14 minutes into Canterbury Bulldogs' 16-10 victory over Canberra in the NRL.
However, a spokesman confirmed Graham is expected to begin training with England later this week.
The former St Helens player is England's most-capped current international, having played 33 Tests for England and Great Britain.
England have lost several players from their original squad for the Samoa game, with half-backs Gareth Widdop and George Williams ruled out through injury.
