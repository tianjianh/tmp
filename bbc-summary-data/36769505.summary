Ex-BHS boss Dominic Chappell admits speeding

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Former BHS boss Dominic Chappell, who bought the retail chain for £1, has pleaded guilty to a speeding offence.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Chappell, 49, of Blandford Forum, Dorset, was caught driving 63.9mph (102.8km/h) in a 40mph (64km/h) speed limit in Andover, Hampshire, on 6 April.
He was driving a Range Rover on Churchill Way at the time, Aldershot Magistrates' Court heard.
Chappell pleaded guilty to the offence through an online court system.
He already has 10 points on his licence for three other speeding offences in 2013, 2014 and 2015, the court was told.
Magistrate Kathryn Sharp said: "Looking at the speed and driving records we would be looking at five points and the possibility of a totting disqualification."
The case was adjourned and Chappell, who was not at the hearing, is set to appear in court on 8 August.
Chappell bought BHS off Sir Philip Green in 2015 through his company Retail Acquisitions.
Last month he denied the £2.6m package he took, including a £600,000 salary, contributed to the demise of the brand.
