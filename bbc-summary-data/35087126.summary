The streets of Oxford were awash with red as 2,200 people took part in the city's annual Santa fun run.

Santas on the Run - one of the largest events of its kind in the UK - began in Broad Street at 09:00 GMT and was marshalled by 45 volunteers dressed as elves.
The two-mile sponsored run - in its ninth year - was in support of Helen & Douglas House hospice in Oxford.
The charity said it was hoping to raise Â£100,000.
Among the runners were Zoe and Adrian Tandy, whose 17-year-old daughter Lauren died at Douglas House in February.
Mr Tandy said: "We wanted to give something back to the hospice after the help we received. Lauren would have loved what we did. If she was still here now she would be helping to raise funds for the hospice too."
