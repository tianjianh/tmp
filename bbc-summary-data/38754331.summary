The owner of land picked as a preferred location for Bath's new park-and-ride says he has no intention of selling it.

The green belt site on the west side of Mill Lane at Bathampton Meadows was chosen by Bath and North East Somerset Council (Banes), on Wednesday night.
It was selected over neighbouring council-owned land, because the 800-car site would be less visible and have potential for a future rail link.
But landowner Steve Horler said there was "absolutely no way" he would sell.
The National Trust has also opposed the plans saying they would "cause significant harm" and "scar the landscape for many years into the future".
The site, according to Banes, was not only chosen because it was close to the city centre but was "well-located for cars coming from the A4, A46 and A363".
But Mr Horler, who runs a holiday let business on his farm, said he "doesn't want to see this beautiful part of Bath destroyed"
"I've got a really successful business in Bathampton Meadows," he said.
"Thousands of people come to enjoy this area every year. They want me to sell it but there's absolutely no way I'm going to."
Tim Warren, leader of the council, insists the city is "at capacity" and the council has to "plan for the future".
"In Bath we're talking about producing 11,000 jobs and these people have to get to work - get in and out - and the city's full up," he said.
The National Trust added it was aware of the impact of traffic and pollution within the city itself but was concerned this development would harm views from nearby Solsbury Hill which it cares for.
"Whether for 800 or 1,200 cars, it is clear that this scale of development would scar the landscape for many years into the future and would mar the wonderful views experienced from Solsbury Hill, which is part of the Cotswolds Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty," a spokesman said.
The application will go to planning for further consideration.
