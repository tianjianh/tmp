Machynlleth school to be named after Owain Glyndwr battle

A new "super-school" in a town with close links to Owain Glyndwr is to be named after a battle fought during his 15th Century rebellion.

Machynlleth primary and secondary schools in Powys are to merge in the summer under the new name of Ysgol Bro Hyddgen.
Hyddgen Mountain in the Pumlumon range is said to have been where Glyndwr had his first significant victory in 1401.
He later established his parliament in Machynlleth.
Powys council's cabinet voted to merge Machynlleth primary and secondary schools last year. The new four to 18-year-old school will officially open in September.
It was named from a shortlist of suggestions from the local community.
The name Hyddgen is already familiar locally and was chosen for Canolfan Hyddgen, the Dyfi Valley's post-16 education and training centre which opened in 2009.
Allan Wynne Jones, chairman of the new school's governing body, said: "I am extremely proud that the name of the new school includes the name Hyddgen, and that it acknowledges the link with Owain Glyndwr.
"It is a name that reminds us of our heritage and also encourages us to look forward confidently, creatively and progressively."
The governing body is also asking the community to help design a logo for the new school and has launched a competition with a Â£20 book token for the successful design.
The closing date for receiving designs is 2 May.
