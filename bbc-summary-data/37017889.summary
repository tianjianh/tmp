[SN]TITLE[SN]
Wigan Athletic 1-1 Birmingham City

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Wigan Athletic rescued a late point through Craig Davies to deny Birmingham City a second consecutive victory.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The visitors had led in the first half when David Davis reacted fastest to tuck in the rebound after Adam Bogdan saved Clayton Donaldson's penalty.
Earlier, Donaldson had hit the post for Blues, and David Cotterill nearly made it 2-0 after half-time but hit the bar.
Wigan went close through Nick Powell before Davies turned in from close range, but the Blues remain unbeaten.
Despite Wigan controlling possession, Birmingham created the better chances and could have gone ahead when Jacques Maghoma's shot was palmed out by Bogdan into the path of the on-rushing Donaldson, but the Jamaican's instinctive effort struck the woodwork.
After the Wigan keeper brought Donaldson down in the area, he got down low to save the striker's resultant spot-kick but Davis was too quick to the rebound and coolly finished.
Powell was then denied by Birmingham stopper Tomasz Kuszczak after half-time and the Blues looked set for their second away win in four days, before Davies' late leveller.
The result leaves Blues one point above the Latics in the table and without a defeat in seven league games, having drawn six of them.
Wigan manager Gary Caldwell:
"There was one team that tried to win it. They got gifted a goal from not our doing and we had to chase a game against a team that likes to pack the defence and counter attack which is never easy. I thought we controlled the situation really well and if anything deserved to win the game so it's a bit of frustration."
"The rule is you can't go in the box until the ball's hit, it's clear. I would just like them to own it up at times to say 'I've made a mistake'. It would help.
"It's the sheer defiance that there's nothing wrong when really there is something wrong. A goal could have been avoided. I felt he was marginally offside as well. You can't get that many things wrong in a football match as important as this."
Birmingham City manager Gary Rowett:
"I couldn't see it, I wish he had (encroached) because I'm sure Clayton would have scored with the retaken one.
"Eight weeks ago the goalkeeper would have been sent off but now it's the double jeopardy rules. A point I think was a fair reflection of the game. They are a good side Wigan, I think they'll have a good season. I'm sure.
"I'm quite enthused at the start. There will be a lot of teams that will panicking a little bit after three games and wondering what work they need to do in the final few weeks of the transfer window. I'm quite pleased with the way we've started the season."
