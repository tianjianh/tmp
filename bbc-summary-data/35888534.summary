On the day of Holi, people throw coloured powder and liquids at each other.
Some of the biggest celebrations take place in the temples of Vrindavan, a town in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh, where, according to legend, the Hindu god Krishna played Holi with his consort Radha.
The festival is celebrated over two days.
The festival also symbolises a new beginning for Hindus to end conflicts and let go of emotional impurities from the past.
