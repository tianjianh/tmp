Sutton United 3-0 Gateshead

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Sutton secured only their second National League win in 10 attempts as Maxime Biamou inspired a 3-0 victory over Gateshead.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The hosts struggled to make their early possession count, although Manny Smith had to produce last-ditch heroics for Gateshead to prevent Kieron Cadogan going clean through.
Biamou drew a foul from Dan Hanford and Roarie Deacon fired the resulting penalty into the roof of the net to give Sutton a reward for their efforts three minutes before the break.
The hosts doubled their advantage through Biamou after 60 minutes and the Frenchman added a third with seven minutes left as Sutton ended their four-game winless run.
