Conwy and Denbighshire power lines plan's new stage

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Controversial plans for overhead power lines across parts of Conwy and Denbighshire have been lodged with the Planning Inspectorate.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Environmentalists have objected to the proposals by SP Manweb for cables over 17km linking a substation at Clocaenog Forest and a terminal at Glascoed.
The cables will carry supplies from four windfarms in the Clocaenog and Brenig areas.
A shorter route option was chosen as minimising impact and costs.
Powerlines will run across the Henllan and Nantglyn area, ahead of options which included links to Connah's Quay, Holywell, Corwen, Trawsfynydd and Dolgarrog.
But environmentalists have called for the cables to run underground.
The inspectorate examines large-scale planning projects and it can take months before a decision is made.
