Concerned staff at Great Ormond Street hospital called police to the site on Monday afternoon.
Officers arrested a 31-year-old man and 25-year-old woman at the scene on suspicion of conspiracy to commit child abduction.
The couple were taken to a central London police station and have since been bailed to a date in mid-April.
Staff alleged they had attempted to gain access to a ward by showing a picture of a baby they claimed was theirs.
Insp Paul Clarke, from the Met, said: "The actions of the staff at Great Ormond Street Hospital, in making all of the necessary checks and the quick response of police in arresting a couple, prevented what could have been a very frightening and harrowing incident."
A hospital spokesman said: "Thankfully this type of incident is exceptionally rare. We are pleased that staff at the hospital acted so swiftly and calmly to ensure the safety of all our patients."
