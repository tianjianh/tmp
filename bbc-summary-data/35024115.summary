Operations were halted last week after heavy rains flooded the airport and damaged key equipment.
A massive relief operation is continuing to get food and medicines to tens of thousands of people. Many residents are still living in shelters.
Key services like power supply and the railways are also functioning as flood waters have receded in some areas.
Some flights, including an Air India service to Port Blair, took off on Sunday. But the airport resumed full operations for both domestic and international flights on Monday, Press Trust of India news agency reported.
"The availability of Chennai airport for all-weather day and night operations for all flights for which domestic and international terminals will be available from 6am [local time] of 7 December," an Airports Authority of India (AAI) statement said.
The rains, the heaviest in 100 years, are being blamed on climate change and many in Chennai say the city needs to prepare better to face extreme weather patterns.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi has promised $150m (Â£99m) to the flood-hit Tamil Nadu state.
A depression in the Bay of Bengal triggered rains in coastal areas.
Earlier in November, non-stop rain for nearly a week brought the city to a standstill.
Three days of fresh rains last week led to massive flooding, inundating homes, hospitals, roads, railway tracks and the city's airport.
At least 280 people are now known to have died in floods in Tamil Nadu state since last month.
