Colin Clements from Powerscreen was speaking to the BBC's Inside Business programme.
He said that firms operating in the Eurozone currently have a significant advantage.
"The euro is a real struggle for us at the moment," he said.
"We're much more expensive landed in a eurozone where our machines are sold by our dealers in euros compared to our European base competitors.
"They also have a big advantage bringing product into the UK so they can undermine our very strong market share in the UK whilst we're struggling to maintain our share in the eurozone."
Colin Clements' interview will be broadcast on BBC Radio Ulster's Inside Business at 13:30 BST on Sunday 26 April.
