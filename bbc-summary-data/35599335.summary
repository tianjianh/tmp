One man dies and another is 'serious' after Highlands avalanche

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
One man has died and another is in a serious condition in hospital following an avalanche on Creag Meagaidh in the western Highlands.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The avalanche was spotted by other climbers and rescue teams in the area.
Four mountain rescue teams attended the scene, 25 miles north east of Fort William, at about 15:15.
No other people were involved in the incident and the search has been stood down.
Insp Donald Campbell: "Police Scotland would like to thank all rescue personnel involved in today's rescue for the rapid response and determination displayed in very challenging conditions.
"Sadly, one man succumbed to his injuries and his climbing companion remains in hospital."
A helicopter was diverted from a search on Ben Nevis for two missing climbers. That search has been suspended.
