Brechfa Forest preferred power farm link route unveiled

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The preferred route to connect the power generated by two wind farms in Carmarthenshire's Brechfa Forest to the electricity network, has been unveiled.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The total length of the connection is about 19 miles (30km) of which Western Power Distribution proposes to place about 4.3 miles (7km) underground.
The preferred route extends from Llandyfaelog, east of Idole, underneath the River Towy, then west of Peniel.
But opponents are against the use of overhead lines on wooden double-poles.
The poles are up to 18m (59ft) high and objectors have claimed the development would damage local people's lives along with the ecology and tourism of the area.
Andrew Hubbold from Western Power Distribution (WPD) said: "In autumn this year WPD will publish a Statement of Community Consultation (SoCC) which sets out how the third and final stage of consultation will be carried out on this proposed connection."
After their consultation, an application will be submitted to the Planning Inspectorate for a decision.
