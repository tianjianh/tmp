Pieces believed to date from between 1500 and 1000 BC were unearthed in the Point area.
Scottish Water had been working on a new line when a saddle quern, used for grinding corn, was spotted.
The site was initially thought to be an Iron Age dwelling but experts now believe they are dealing with something older.
The water line has been diverted and the site evaluated by a specialist team.
Archaeologist Alastair Rees said: "The pottery that we first found initially seemed to be from the Iron Age.
"But since then we have found much more pottery and it is definitely Middle Bronze Age, which is much older in date.
"So we have had to rethink the site considerably."
