[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The internal structure of Capel Aberfan, built in 1876, was completely destroyed by the blaze which broke out at 01:50 BST on Saturday.
It was used as a temporary mortuary following the Aberfan disaster in 1966 and housed a memorial organ.
South Wales Police said investigations "determined the fire was started deliberately".
Although the chapel closed in 2012, services occasionally took place and renovations were ongoing to try and modernise it and bring it back into community use.
