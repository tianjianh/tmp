The former US Open winner is ranked 101st in the world and outside an automatic qualifying place, but he has been invited by the PGA of America.
McDowell has missed four of his past five cuts and the 37-year-old Northern Irishman exited the Canadian Open at the halfway stage on Friday.
A one-over 73 left McDowell on three over par, seven shots shy of the cut.
He carded five bogeys and four birdies in the second round in Ontario.
Shane Lowry, who will also play in the US PGA, which starts on 10 August, missed the cut after a 73 left him on two under par.
However, fellow Irishman Seamus Power did survive after a 70 meant he goes into Saturday's third round on six under par, six shots behind American leader Martin Flores.
Power, who is 140th in the Fedex Cup standings, is sharing 37th place.
McDowell, who has slipped to 101st in the world rankings and did not earn a place at last week's Open Championship, is 119th in the PGA Tour's Fedex Cup standings.
