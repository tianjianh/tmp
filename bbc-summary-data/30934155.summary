The station's flagship event will be held in the city's Earlham Park on 23-24 May.
Seven time Grammy winner Taylor Swift is the first act confirmed for Europe's biggest free ticketed music event.
"They are rowdy, insane, in the best way - there seems to be a lot of jumping, which I love," the singer said of the UK crowd.
"Everyone talks about the festivals in England being the best ones you can go to. I feel like I've been missing out - I'm really excited."
The full line-up for the event and ticketing information will be announced on Radio 1 over the coming months.
Last year's event in Glasgow was opened by One Direction and headlined by Coldplay and Katy Perry.
In the lead up to Big Weekend, for the fourth year running, Radio 1 and BBC Learning will also open the doors to Radio 1's Academy.
The station hopes to inspire local 16-19-year-olds to take the next step in their careers by inviting them to attend a series of radio shows, masterclasses and Q&As.
Radio 1 Breakfast Show host Nick Grimshaw said: "I can't wait to start the festival season with Radio 1's Big Weekend."
Radio 1's Big Weekend will also host a number of acts who've come through BBC Introducing.
Last year, Royal Blood and Catfish and the Bottlemen performed.
Ben Cooper, Controller, Radio 1 and 1Xtra said: "Radio 1's Big Weekend is the first big festival of the year. This is where summer begins and it's going to be amazing.
"There's always a dream line-up and I can't wait to see Swifty in Norwich!"
Big Weekend, which will be will be produced in partnership with Norwich City Council, will be broadcast live on Radio 1, 1Xtra and streamed on the Radio 1 website.
Highlights will also be broadcast live on BBC Three.
