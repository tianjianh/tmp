The 26-year-old former Swansea player has been on loan at Villa Park since January, scoring three goals in 11 appearances for the FA Cup finalists.
"This is the happiest I have been in a long time," said Sinclair, who started only three times for Manchester City.
"I believe that will help me perform better and push on for this great club in the coming years."
Sinclair joined Manchester City in 2012 for £8m, but was sent out on loan to West Brom in 2013.
He began his career at Bristol Rovers before joining Chelsea in 2005, but played only five times for the Blues in five years and spent six spells out on loan.
A former England Under-21 international, he moved to Swansea for an initial £500,000 in 2010.
