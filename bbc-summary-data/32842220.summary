The seven-time winners couldn't muster enough votes for their youngest ever entrant, 17-year-old Molly Sterling.
Iceland, Switzerland, the Czech Republic, Malta, Portugal and San Marino also failed to make the cut.
Sweden, the bookmakers' favourite, sailed through to Saturday's grand final in Vienna.
Its act, Mans Zelmerlow, joins automatic qualifiers Austria, the UK, France, Germany, Spain, Italy and special guests Australia.
The full list of 10 acts to qualify from Thursday's semi-final is as follows:
Despite Ireland's historical success at Eurovision, it has struggled in the 21st Century.
It has taken last place twice, in 2007 and 2013, and failed to progress beyond the semi-finals five times since they were introduced in 2004.
However, Ireland has fared better than the Czech Republic, which has never made it to the grand final.
The UK will be represented at Saturday's show by duo Electro Velvet, whose song, Still In Love With You, has been described as an "electro swing" track.
The final will be broadcast on BBC One from 20:00 BST, and there will be live updates and discussion on the BBC News website's dedicated Eurovision live page.
