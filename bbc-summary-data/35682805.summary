The 17-year-old finished strongly to win in 21.33 seconds from Ben Snaith, in second, and third-placed David Lima.
"I didn't even think I would make the final so to get the gold medal is literally breathtaking," said Harries.
Adelle Tracey, 22, caused an upset by winning the women's 800m, as Leah Barrow was second ahead of Lynsey Sharp and Jenny Meadows.
Tracey, one of six teenagers to light the Olympic flame at the London 2012 opening ceremony, said: "I'll be so happy to wear my first senior vest and to do it so early in the season is amazing.
"I'm working part time as a freelance hair and make-up artist and it's good because it fits around my training. I do prosthetics and model making as well, so it's very diverse.
"I did Lenny Waite's wedding this summer and Andy Vernon's wife and Gemma Hillier-Moses (all fellow athletes), because it works very well with training, it's just one morning. But I've done stuff for Dr Who and Top Gear."
The event is being used to select the Great Britain team for the World Indoors in Portland from 17-20 March.
Following the first day of the trials on Saturday, there were 17 finals on Sunday and selectors will meet on Monday before naming the team on Tuesday.
In the women's events, European champion Tiffany Porter triumphed in the 60m hurdles with a time of 7.98 seconds as Serita Solomon came in second and Lucy Hatton in third.
Hannah England eased to 1500m victory, while Louise Bloor claimed the 200m crown and Meghan Beesley won the 400m final.
Sinead Gutzmore was already in first place in the triple jump and reached a 13.35m personal best with her last effort to round off her win.
Stephanie Twell earned 3,000m victory as Bethan Davies set a national record of 12 minutes 44.99 seconds to win the 3,000m walk race.
Jazmin Sawyers set a personal best of 6.67m to win the long jump.
In the men's races, there were wins for Nigel Levine in the 200m, Jamie Webb in the 800m and Charlie Grice in the 1500m.
Meanwhile, Scott Lincoln won the shot, Chris Baker the high jump, and Luke Cutts the pole vault.
Tom Bosworth's 10 minutes 58.21 seconds in the 3,000 walk final was also a national record.
Paralympic champion Aled Davies was competing in the shot put and improved his own World record.
The 24-year-old Welshman, who competes in the F42 category, managed 16.14m with his penultimate throw against his able-bodied rivals, finishing fifth.
