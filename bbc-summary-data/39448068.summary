Ulster counties Monaghan and Donegal missed out on reaching the Division One final after a dramatic day of Football League action.

Monaghan were six points up midway through the second half but Dublin hit back to win 2-15 to 1-15 and remain on track for a fifth title in a row.
Donegal also enjoyed a healthy lead but eventually lost to Mayo by 1-12 to 0-13 and missed out on points difference.
Kerry's 1-21 to 2-11 win over Tyrone was enough to grab a final place.
The Kingdom had started the day sixth, but their margin of victory at Fitzgerald Stadium meant their points difference of 13 was three better than that of Donegal.
Cavan were beaten by Roscommon and are relegated to Division Two.
For much of the afternoon it looked there would be an all-Ulster meeting in the Division One decider between Monaghan and Donegal.
But at the end of the dray, remarkably no Ulster counties had qualified for any of next weekend's four league finals at Croke Park in Dublin.
Monaghan took control of their match against All-Ireland champions Dublin when man-of-the-match Jack McCarron netted from an acute angle in the second half.
But goals by substitutes Bernard Brogan and James McCarthy saw the Dubs secure a comeback victory.
McCarthy's effort came as the match was entering stoppage-time with the teams level, and proved a heartbreaking end for Monaghan.
Cillian O'Connor netted an early penalty and also contributed five points as Mayo made sure of their top-flight survival by beating Donegal by two points.
Donegal were 0-13 to 1-6 up early in the second half but, after they had Eamon Doherty sent-off, the match swung Mayo's way.
Tyrone's slim chances of reaching the Division One final were scuppered in Killarney, where Kerry ran out winners by seven points.
Instead it was the Kingdom who benefited from other results to book a place in next weekend's decider against holders Dublin.
The Red Hands got off to the worst possible start, conceding a goal with less than two minutes on the clock. David Moran picked out Michael Geaney with a clever pass, and the Dingle man beat Mickey O'Neill with a low shot.
Tyrone failed to score from play while playing with the wind in the opening half, and it was Kerry who displayed all the attacking flair to open a 10-point advantage.
Kerry led by 1-12 to 0-6 at the break, but Tyrone struck for a goal for only the second time in the current league campaign, Peter Harte collecting a Frank Burns pass to smash the ball into the roof of the net in the 44th minute.
Tyrone grabbed a second goal through a Peter Harte penalty after Ronan Shanahan was sent-off for hauling down Frank Burns.
