Spanish newspaper AS has reported the Wales forward, 27, will be out for three to four weeks.
Real face Atletico Madrid in the first leg of their Champions League semi-final next Tuesday, with the final in Cardiff on 3 June.
Bale, 27, came off after 39 minutes in Sunday's El Clasico defeat by Barcelona.
Real, level on points with La Liga leaders Barca and with a game in hand, have important league games this week, facing Deportivo on Wednesday and Valencia on Saturday.
Wales play a World Cup qualifier in Serbia on 11 June, eight days after the Champions League final.
However, Bale is suspended for the match in Belgrade.
