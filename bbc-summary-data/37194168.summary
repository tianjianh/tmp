Bristol City Council won an injunction against Tent City residents - who are camping in an Easton park.
The group, which has camped in Peel Street Park since April, has 28 days to leave or be moved by bailiffs.
Mayor of Bristol, Marvin Rees, said despite an offer of help through a specialist homeless service some people were "choosing to remain in the camp".
"The council and its partners understand that sometimes tents or temporary shelters are erected by vulnerable people in need of help and support," he added.
The group of 10 homeless people said they had raised Â£1,500 to fund a campaign to stay.
Spokesperson Ben Richie called on the council to "properly assess their housing needs".
He said: "Bristol has a serious homelessness problem that needs properly addressing. We understand the council is desperately short of resources but are shocked they are trying to criminalise homeless people."
However, Mr Rees said: "Those camped on the land have all been offered the support of St Mungo's outreach team, which is commissioned by the local authority to provide support to people sleeping rough.
"St Mungo's visited the camp more than 18 times and spoke to 15 different people. In addition the council's Streetwise team, which deals with anti-social behaviour issues, has visited the camp five times.
"This support is ongoing and we will continue to engage with the people still left at the camp."
