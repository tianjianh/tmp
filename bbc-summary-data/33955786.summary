Japan's economy contracted by 0.4% between April and June compared to the first three months of the year.
But the country's benchmark Nikkei 225 index rose by 0.6% to 20,639.64 points.
Last week's strong finish on Wall Street and a more stable yuan currency both helped to reassure investors and offset the impact of the weak economic data.
Over the past week, Asian markets had fretted over Beijing's surprise decision to allow the yuan to trade more freely, sending the currency on a downward spiral for several days.
Monday's early trade saw Chinese shares slightly lower with the Shanghai Composite down 0.5% to 3,947.07 points.
China central bank's chief economist Ma Jun has said that the yuan will be likely to move in both directions as the economy stabilises.
The People's Bank of China (PBOC) fixed Monday's yuan midpoint at 6.3969 against the dollar, stronger than Friday's fix of 6.3975.
The currency is allowed to trade 2% below or above the midpoint set by the PBOC.
Hong Kong's benchmark Hang Seng index was slightly lower, down 0.3% to 23,926.60 points.
In Australia, stock boards on Monday showed largely positive figures with the S&P/ASX 200 up 0.5% to 5,382.90 points.
Shares in mining company Newcrest jumped by more than 5% in early trade after Australia's largest gold miner posted a strong net profit for the past year.
In South Korea, the benchmark Kospi index remained largely flat at 1,980.57 points when trading reopened after last Friday's public holiday.
