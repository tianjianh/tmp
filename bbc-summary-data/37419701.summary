Manchester United are not a club in crisis, says Northampton Town boss Rob Page ahead of their EFL Cup third-round tie on Wednesday.

In the 10 days leading up to their trip to Sixfields to face the League One side, Jose Mourinho's United have lost three matches, beaten by Manchester City, Feyenoord and Watford.
"He'll be working hard to put things right," Page said of Mourinho.
"There's no crisis, it's three defeats. That will be the message."
Talking to BBC Radio Northampton, Page continued: "They're expected to win the game and if they don't they'll be criticised."
The Cobblers, who are 11th in English football's third tier, set up the tie against United when they beat West Bromwich Albion 4-3 on penalties.
"It's been a long time coming since the draw was made," Page said. "We've banned the players from talking about it just so we can focus on the league.
"When we scored the winning penalty I thought the atmosphere was terrific and that's why you're in the game, you want to create more moments like that."
Northampton Town have never won a competitive game against Manchester United, with their last match against the Red Devils - an FA Cup tie in 2004 - ending in a 3-0 defeat.
"We know we're going to be in for a tough game, so it's about us focussing on what we can do and recreating what we did against Premier League opposition in West Brom," Page said.
