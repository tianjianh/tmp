Owen Delaney, 40, from Teddington, has been mapping out Christmas-themed images using Strava - an app which uses GPS to track users running routes.
During his jogs in Bushy Park, Richmond, he has created pictures of Santa Claus, a cracker and a snowman.
The father-of-two said he hopes to draw something new "every day until Christmas".
"The idea first came about a couple of years ago when I did something similar for an online competition," he told the BBC.
Originally Mr Delaney had intended to stop after his first drawing - a depiction of Rudolph.
"But my friends seemed to like it so I did the Santa one the next day," he said.
Each run takes meticulous planning to avoid "having to wade through any rivers or ponds" and can take up to up to an hour to design.
"I used to draw a lot of cartoons when I was younger, and sometimes made hand drawn Christmas cards for people," Mr Delaney said.
"I guess this is a similar theme, but I never imagined being able to use the park as a canvas."
Mr Delaney is keeping the design for his final run on Christmas day a secret.
He said: "Everyone seems to be enjoying it and it's bringing lots of smiles and lovely comments from people.
"We could all do with something simple and happy this year I think."
