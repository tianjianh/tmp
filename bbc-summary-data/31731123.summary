Women need more power in Wales, says Rosemary Butler

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
More needs to be done to get women into positions of influence in Wales, assembly Presiding Officer Dame Rosemary Butler has said.

She said women were a resource that Wales could not afford to waste.
Dame Rosemary said it was important women were "not just implementing decisions that men had made".
Ahead of International Women's Day on Sunday, she said she had tried to get women as school governors, magistrates, health board members and politicians.
Speaking to BBC's The Wales Report, the Newport West AM said she agreed with political parties prioritising women, but warned opportunities were being missed.
"When the assembly started in 1999 we had a blank canvas. They were empty seats, so women were not seen to be taking men's seats.
"And I think that we missed the boat as women, that we didn't continue the momentum to try and encourage more women."
The Wales Report with Huw Edwards is on at 22:40 GMT, 4 March, on BBC One Wales.
