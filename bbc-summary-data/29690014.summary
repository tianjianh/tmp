Shrien Dewani 'cold and calculating', says wife's cousin

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The cousin of Anni Dewani, who was killed while on honeymoon in South Africa, has told a court she was "suspicious" of Anni's husband.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Shrien Dewani, 34, from Bristol, denies arranging his wife's murder in 2010. She was shot dead in a hijacked taxi.
Sneha Mashru told Western Cape High Court Mr Dewani was "very cold and controlling" after his wife's death.
Ms Mashru said Mr Dewani told her he had been pushed out of the taxi's back window during the hijacking.
Appearing at the court in Cape Town, Ms Mashru said Mr Dewani told her Anni wanted to see the townships but he was tired and wanted to go home.
"He told me that Anni told him 'don't be so boring', so they went."
Ms Mashru said she recorded a later conversation with Mr Dewani because "some of the things he said to me did not make sense".
"I did not think Anni would have wanted to go to the township. I also thought it was strange that a man like him could be pushed out a back window."
Ms Mashru told the court she stayed at Mr Dewani's home in Bristol when he returned.
"I felt very uncomfortable in that house. Shrien was acting very cold and controlling."
She said his behaviour was "not the way I thought someone would be while grieving for his wife".
"I also saw him eat a lot of food. He was eating normally. I had to force myself to get some kind of energy so it was strange to me that he could be so normal."
She told the court she thought it was "strange" Mr Dewani had the "whole funeral" arrangements on a spreadsheet.
Ms Mashru said on the day of Anni's funeral she wanted to do Anni's make-up "one last time" so she went to the funeral parlour with Anni's sister and Mr Dewani.
"Shrien was trying to squeeze the bangles on her. We said 'stop it' and he just dropped her arm.
"He put the mark on her forehead and then just left. I did not see the love. 'How could you not feel anything?' I thought."
The prosecution argues that Mr Dewani wanted out of his marriage and arranged a staged hijacking in which he escaped and Anni was killed.
The trial continues.
