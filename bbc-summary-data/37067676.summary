[SN]TITLE[SN]
Yeovil Town 0-1 Morecambe

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Kevin Ellison's second-half strike sent Morecambe to the top of the early League Two table as they claimed victory at Yeovil Town.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 37-year-old winger's neat finish capped off a lovely move from the Shrimps in the 55th minute to continue their impressive start to the season.
Jack Dunn and substitute Lee Molyneux combined well with the latter sending Ellison though on goal and he side-footed past Glovers goalkeeper Artur Krysiak.
Morecambe had their keeper Barry Roche to thank for taking maximum points.
He tipped away a first-half header from Tom Eaves and then pushed a Matty Dolan piledriver onto a post.
In stoppage-time, Roche also pushed wide powerful shots from substitute Tahvon Campbell and a Dolan free-kick from 25 yards.
Ellison nearly helped himself to a brace in the 62nd minute but Krysiak managed to tip his header wide. Molyneux was again the provider, sending a perfect cross to the back post, but the winger failed to convert.
