Exeter City manager Paul Tisdale says he found it tough to watch his side's first home win since April.

The Grecians beat Mansfield 2-0 to end a 259-day wait for a victory in front of their own fans at St James Park.
"In many ways that was hideous to watch," Tisdale told BBC Radio Devon.
"I loved the last two minutes, other than that it was hard work, but we got it and the boys have deserved it with what they did today, but also how they've continued their work."
Ollie Watkins scored his second goal late in the game to seal the win, which was Exeter's third in a four-game unbeaten run.
"We have to start looking at taking 10 points out of the next 12, that's what you have to do, you have to keep going, " added Tisdale, who is the second longest-serving manager in English professional football after Arsenal's Arsene Wenger.
"The squad is being strengthened all the time with returning injured players and we've got some spirit about us.  It was a really good day at the Park and I loved it."
