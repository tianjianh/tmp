Three men who paddled in a fridge freezer down a river in Flintshire have been branded "highly irresponsible".

They used a plank of wood as a paddle and remained afloat for nearly two miles before abandoning their makeshift vessel on the banks of the River Dee.
Concerned members of the public rang the coastguard service when they spotted the men on Tuesday night.
It is thought they sailed from Queensferry to Connah's Quay where they dumped the fridge and fled.
A coastguard spokesman said: "They all scarpered as our rescue team came on the scene.
"It was highly irresponsible. They had no life jackets and it obviously wasn't the most stable of craft.
"Things could have gone very badly wrong. It's a very tidal area.
"They were extremely lucky they didn't sink or get stuck in the mud when the fridge ran aground."
