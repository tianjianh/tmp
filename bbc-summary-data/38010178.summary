The 62-year-old leaves Links Park with the team just two points off the bottom of League Two.
Former Dundee United and Livingston boss Hegarty joined Montrose in February 2014.
He kept the club up via the play-off final, while last season they finished in eighth spot.
"Paul arrived at a real low point in our history and was instrumental in building enough confidence back into the team to get them over the line in the play-off final," said chairman John Crawford.
"We came perilously close and as East Stirlingshire found to their cost last season, you can't take anything for granted anymore in this league. We will always be indebted to Paul for keeping us up.
"He is a true professional, a real gentleman and it has been a pleasure to work with him. We wish him all the best and every success for the future."
