[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 27-year-old has been given the chance to resurrect his career after serving time in prison.
Pipe, who can play in a number of positions in midfield and defence, had been training with the Exiles this week.
County currently sit in the relegation places in the Blue Square Bet Premier.
Caerphilly-born Pipe previously played for Coventry City, Notts County and Bristol Rovers.
Pipe made one substitute appearance for Wales' full side against the United States in 2003.
He was jailed for 38 months last year for fracturing the skull of another man in an unprovoked attack in Bristol in September 2009.
Pipe has been included in County's squad for Saturday's game at Braintree Town.
