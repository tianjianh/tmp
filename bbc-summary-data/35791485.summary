[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Gills started the stronger of the two teams, but it was Southend's Anthony Wordsworth who opened the scoring with an opportunistic finish.
Jack Payne spurned a fine chance to double the Shrimpers' lead, smashing the ball into the side-netting.
And Luke Norris made them pay, levelling for Gillingham from close range for his sixth goal of the season.
