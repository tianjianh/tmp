Ashley Brace: Welsh boxer to fight for first pro title in Ebbw Vale

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Welsh boxer Ashley Brace will fight for her first professional title in her hometown of Ebbw Vale on 22 April.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Brace will take on an as yet unnamed opponent for the vacant WBC International bantamweight title.
The 26-year-old has won all five of her professional bouts so far.
Brace quit amateur boxing after being told she was ineligible to compete at the 2014 Commonwealth Games because of suggestions she had fought professionally as a kickboxer.
Her involvement at the 2013 Unified Kickboxing World Championships ruled her out of the Games in Glasgow, an amateur-only event.
