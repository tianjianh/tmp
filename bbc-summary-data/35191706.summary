Leeds Rhinos: Floods force Super League side out of training ground

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Leeds Rhinos have been forced to move out of their training ground after severe flooding at the weekend.

The Super League champions and rugby union club Yorkshire Carnegie train in Kirkstall next to the river Aire, which burst its banks on Sunday.
All seven training pitches, in addition to the main building, were contaminated by flood water.
It is likely to be at least a month before the two sides and 60 staff will be able to return.
"It is catastrophic for all the rugby operation, the medical side, coaching, development and the Foundation," said club chief executive Gary Hetherington.
"We have had flooding before, but never to this extent.
"It was under six feet of water - so that covered the gym, rehab facilities, wrestle room, meeting room and changing facilities," he added.
Six grass training pitches will be treated, although it is thought the 3G pitch, which allows all-weather use, will have to be dug up.
It is not yet known how much it will cost to repair the damage.
The Rhinos, who begin the defence of their title against Warrington on 4 February, will need to find alternative training venues in the city, but they are due to spend part of January in the USA at a training camp.
Yorkshire Carneige, meanwhile, are third in the Championship and are preparing to play at Ealing on 2 January.
Staff who deal with the medical, conditioning, administrative and charitable aspects of both clubs are likely to be found a temporary working space at Headingley Stadium, which is about two miles away.
