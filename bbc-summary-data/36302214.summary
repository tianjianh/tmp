Chief executive Oliver Morley tweeted a photo showing a "prototype" using Apple's Wallet app on an iPhone.
He says it will be an "add-on" to the plastic card rather than a replacement.
Wallet already stores boarding passes and credit, debit, gift and discount cards. Payment information is encrypted end-to-end and authorised with the user's fingerprint or passcode.

A driver's licence is due to be available in digital format by 2018.
