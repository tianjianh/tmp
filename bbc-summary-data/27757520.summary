In addition to stories carried on our E3 index, our North America Technology correspondent Richard Taylor and technology writer Dave Lee will both be tweeting from the show, while Marc Cieslak and others from the BBC Click team will also be providing updates.
The event and its associated press conferences are not open to the public, but the firms involved are making it possible to watch some of the key announcements live.
Here are some of the relevant details and links:
Microsoft hosts the first of the major press conferences at 09.30 local time (17:30 BST) on Monday.
It can be viewed on the firm's website, as well as via Xbox consoles, Spike TV and a special Windows Phone app.
Video games publisher EA is promising to show off Battlefield Hardline, The Sims 4, and EA Sports UFC among other titles at 12:00 local time (20:00 BST) on Monday.
The event will be streamed on EA's site, as well as Spike TV and Twitch's site.
France's Ubisoft is the other publisher hosting a major event on press day. It promises to show footage from Assassin's Creed Unity, Far Cry 4 and The Crew among other games at 15:00 local time (23:00 BST) on Monday.
The event will be streamed on its YouTube channel and Twitch.
Sony rounds off the press day's events with its event, starting 18:00 local time, Monday (02:00 BST, Tuesday).
The firm is screening live footage to dozens of cinemas in the US and has also released a special app for the PS4.
But if that's not an option, you can also watch the event on its website and via a Ustream feed.
Nintendo has repeated last year's decision not to go to the expense of hosting a physical press conference.
Instead it will stream a "digital event" at 09:00 local time (17:00) on Tuesday, during which it will show off new gameplay footage and announce new titles.
The video can be watched at its site, which also lists three follow-up streams that will show live demos from the Nintendo team on E3's show floor.
While the other games publishers don't have major events of their own, several have scheduled gameplay reveals on Twitch. CD Projekt RED's Witcher 3, Bethesda's Evil Within and 2K's Civilization: Beyond Earth are some of the titles listed on the site's schedule over the course of the week.
Spike TV is promising its own "wall-to-wall" coverage, with a live demo of Alienware's Alpha Steambox and an interview with Oculus Rift's founder among promised coverage for PC gamers, as well as plenty of material for console owners.
The expo's organiser, The Entertainment Software Association, will also be gathering together screenshots and trailers at its own site, E3 Insider, in addition to providing recordings of the main press conferences after they have happened.
Several of the major video games sites are running special E3 sections, including Polygon, Gamespot, Kotaku, IGN, and CVG.
Finally, a full list of attendees and their various press releases can be found on the official E3 Expo website.
