People were advised by London Fire Brigade to avoid the area, with London Wall closed between Wood Street and Blomfield Street.
Engineers were called to reports of gas escaping at Salisbury House in Finsbury Circus shortly before 15:30 BST.
City of London Police later tweeted that London Wall had re-opened at about 21:15.
Roads had been cordoned off while contractors worked to fix the gas leak.
