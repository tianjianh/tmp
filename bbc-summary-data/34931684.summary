Harry Thornton inquest: Workmate describes moment army shooting began

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A former workmate of a man shot dead by the Army in Belfast has told an inquest about the moment a soldier opened fire on his friend.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Arthur Murphy was a passenger in a van driven by Harry Thornton as they passed a police station in August 1971.
A member of the Parachute Regiment, known in court as "Soldier A", fired two shots that hit Mr Thornton in the head and killed him instantly.
Mr Murphy said he agreed with his original statements about the shooting.
Earlier this week, another soldier, referred to as "Soldier C" told the inquest he thought Mr Murphy had opened fire on him and Springfield Road police station.
It has always been understood that the vehicle had merely backfired.
Mr Murphy told the inquest that Harry Thornton, a father of six, decided to drive their 1955 work van from their accommodation less than a mile away.
He drove a short distance along the Springfield Road, the court heard, and it backfired twice as it passed the police station, close to the Falls Road junction.
A police officer later tested the vehicle and found that it was liable to backfire before the engine had warmed up.
Mr Murphy described how they had stopped at traffic lights.
"I heard a bang, I looked over, and Harry was shot," he said.
"I was taken into the barracks and I was beaten up."
He described the injuries he sustained to his head, and bruising all over his body as two men in the barracks assaulted him and shouted: "Where's the stuff?"
No weapon was ever found in or around the van, and neither Mr Thornton nor Mr Murphy had ever been involved with any paramilitary organisation.
During cross examination it emerged that two Royal Ulster Constabulary officers were later charged with assaulting Mr Murphy, but were acquitted at a trial in 1972.
Mr Murphy added that nine years after the shooting, he was awarded compensation for the injuries he received in the barracks.
Counsel for the Thornton family asked Mr Murphy about Soldier C's testimony.
The soldier had said that the van was driven erratically, and that Mr Murphy had bobbed down and leant over behind Mr Thornton, poking a "tubular instrument" out of the van, before two shots were fired at the police station.
"That's lies," Mr Murphy told the court repeatedly. "That's pure lies".
"We had no weapons, we'd nothing. We were just working men."
There was sustained rioting in west Belfast after Mr Thornton's death.
About two days later, 10 people were shot dead by the army.
That incident later became known by the victims' families as the Ballymurphy massacre.
In 2012, the government wrote a letter of apology to Mr Thornton's widow Mary confirming that her husband had been an "innocent man".
