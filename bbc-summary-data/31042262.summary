Justin Bieber has apologised for the way he has behaved over the last 18 months.

The singer, 20, said sorry in a video he released online shortly after appearing on the Ellen DeGeneres Show.
"How I've been acting in the last year, year and a half, is not who I am. I was pretending," he said.
"Often we pretend to be something we are not to cover up for what we are truly feeling inside."
The reason for releasing the video isn't clear but it seems Justin Bieber may have been unhappy with his interview with chat show host Ellen.
During the minute-long apology recorded at home he explains that the live studio audience meant he felt uncomfortable.
"I was afraid of what people are thinking of me right now," he said. "It's been a minute since I have made a public appearance.
"I didn't want to come off arrogant or conceited."
In a tweet after he left the television studio he wrote: "@TheEllenShow. Happy birthday! Sorry I was so nervous."
To which Ellen DeGeneres replied: "You were perfect. Thanks for surprising me!"
Over the last 18 months the 20-year-old Canadian has made headlines for all the wrong reasons.
In June last year he issued an apology after footage of him leaked using the n-word while telling a joke about the Ku Klux Klan.
Justin Bieber was charged with assault and dangerous driving after crashing his quad bike into a minivan near his hometown of Stratford, Ontario.
He's also serving two years probation for throwing eggs at his neighbour's house in LA.
Justin Bieber's last official release was the album, Believe, in June 2012.
Now 20, he's been one of the most photographed and talked about musicians since being discovered by fellow singer Usher at the age of 14.
Many believe his behaviour may be down to the transition he's making musically and in his own personal life.
He's switching from squeaky clean teen pop star to an adult, an issue he addresses in his video.
"Growing up in this business is hard. Growing up in general is hard. I felt awkward up there," he said.
He also says he's much more at home on a stage performing than facing an audience for a television interview.
"I felt people were judging me for what happened in the past. I just want to make the best impression on people, be kind, loving and gently.
"People can call me a softie but that's how my mum raised me."
