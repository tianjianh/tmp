Sam Smith's Theory of Winning Everything

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The maths all looks pretty good for Sam Smith after he added four Grammys to his mountain of awards.

By our sums the soul singer has now won a major industry gong for every 162 seconds of music he's recorded.
That's an intake of 15 prizes in exchange for his one album, its six singles plus appearances on tracks by Naughty Boy and Disclosure.
If Sam converts any of his five Brit award nominations later this month, Newsbeat's calculator may explode.
"Thank you so much for breaking my heart because you got me four Grammys," he told the audience in Los Angeles on Sunday night.
We suspect he meant "mantelpiece" when he said "heart" as he walked off with four trophies - for record of the year, song of the year, best new artist and best pop vocal album.
The 22-year-old added: "Before I made this record [In the Lonely Hour], I was doing everything to try to get my music heard. I tried to lose weight and... I was making awful music.
"It was only until I started to be myself that the music started to flow and people started to listen. So, thank you, guys, for accepting me to be just me."
He may be a humble lad, but it's hard to imagine an awards ceremony without Sam grappling with chunks of metal, perspex and general shiny stuff.
Undaunted Newsbeat went in quest of the five awards Sam probably won't win, at least not this year.
Ok, so Sam seems like a pretty peace-loving chap. But we fear his schedule may not be able to accommodate international diplomacy until at least 2016.
The current holders of the Nobel Peace Prize are Malala Yousafzai, the schoolgirl educational campaigner who defied the Taliban, along with Indian child rights campaigner Kailash Satyarthi.
This is the award given to the best European footballer of the year, voted for by fellow professional players. Cristiano Ronaldo's the current holder, but doesn't Sam look great in Cris's suit?
Ok, so this is less of an award and more the most prized tennis trophy on earth. To make it a bit harder for Sam to add this particular bit of bling to his collection, we've set him the challenge of winning the women's singles title. We think that's perfectly fair. The current holder is Petra Kvitova. We suspect she is not worried.
Because we fear Sam will make us look silly by winning all of the above, we're making this one *even* harder. Here's how the soul singer might look if he were named Glamour's Woman of the Year. Dutch model Doutzen Kroes, the real winner, is untroubled, we hear.
We have no idea whether Sam has secret horticultural powers. He could well be tending to a tray of seedlings in a greenhouse near you right now. But with the Brit Awards around the corner, we're going to give him until he's at least 25 to beat the majesty of this enormous squash. If you're wondering, this fine specimen won in the giant marrow class at the Harrogate Autumn Flower Show.
Good luck Sam. We believe in you!
