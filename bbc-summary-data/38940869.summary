[SN]TITLE[SN]
Barrow 0-0 Torquay United

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
National League play-off hopefuls Barrow were held to a goalless draw by Torquay at Holker Street.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Both sides struggled to make things happen during a lacklustre first half of few chances.
It opened up after the break, with Jordan Williams wasting a great chance by dallying on the ball and giving Torquay time to recover after a swift counter-attack.
Torquay's Jared Hodgkiss was forced into a last-ditch block on the line to deny Moussa Diarra after Brendan Moore was caught flapping at a corner late on, but it stayed goalless.
