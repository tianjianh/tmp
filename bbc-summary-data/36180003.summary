Scottish Championship play-off: Ayr United 2-1 Peterhead (6-2)

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Ayr United completed their stroll into the Scottish Championship play-off final with another win over Peterhead.

Leading 4-1 from the first leg in midweek, they were ahead as Robbie Crawford opened his right foot to virtually pass the ball into net.
Peterhead were level when a speculative cross from Leighton McIntosh spun off the head of Michael Donald and diverted under his own crossbar.
Nicky Devlin restored the lead to secure a play-off against Stranraer.
The equaliser had briefly silenced a home crowd of 1,848, but few sheltering from the wind and rain in the old stadium had been worrying that it would trigger a northern resurgence.
Devlin was on the end of Michael Donald corner as Graeme Smith failed to get to grips with the floated cross to kill the game 12 minutes into the second half.
Jim McInally's team failed to capitalise on the weather at their back in the first half, even dovetailed with the return of top scorer Rory McAllister after suspension.
It was always odds against them producing a miracle after a run of seven matches without a win and, in stark contrast, Ayr were strengthened by the re-appearance of Jamie Adams.
The Honest Men are now two games away from a return to the second tier of Scottish football.
And, beyond that, the possibility of the rebirth of the Ayrshire derby if Kilmarnock were to be relegated from the Premiership.
