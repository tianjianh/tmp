County Championship: Jake Libby hits his first Championship century of the season

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Nottinghamshire's Jake Libby hit his first Championship century of the season at Durham to give his side's slim survival hopes a boost.

Resuming on 129-2, Libby extended his third-wicket stand with Michael Lumb to 141 before Lumb went for 82.
Notts looked set for a big total at 268-4, but lost 6-45 to be bowled out for 313 - with Libby the last man out for 144 lbw to Paul Coughlin.
Durham lost three quick wickets as they closed on 83-3, a lead of just 14 runs.
Nottinghamshire, who are 35 points behind Durham and safety with three matches remaining, realistically need to win their remaining games to stand any chance of staying in Division One.
Once Lumb was removed by Graham Onions in the morning, Notts looked to pile on the runs after lunch.
But the new ball brought wickets for Durham and after Jennings bowled Samit Patel for 37, the visitors' lower-order was rolled over and finished their first innings with a lead of just 69 runs.
After tea, Durham opener Mark Stoneman was caught at slip by Brendan Taylor off Steven Mullaney for 39, Harry Gurney trapped Scott Borthwick for a four-ball duck and Jack Burnham was bowled by Imran Tahir cheaply.
