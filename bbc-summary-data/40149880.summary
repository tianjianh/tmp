The Welsh side ended on a high by winning just their second game of the season, beating Team Northumbria 52-47 in Ebbw Vale.
"This season all the players have improved," Wilcox said.
"It was great to show everybody how much they've improved and finish on a high note."
Dragons finished last of the 10 sides in the Superleague, three points behind Northumbria.
"It's been a challenging season, we haven't quite got over the line on such small margins," Wilcox said.
"It's been a real growth this year. We've had some young players that have had experience for the first time and they will have learnt so much from this.
"So it bodes well for the future."
Dragons had led 26-21 at half-time against Northumbria on Saturday, only for the visitors to pull back to level 36-36 at the end of the third quarter.
But the Welsh stepped up the pressure in the final quarter to win by five points.
"It was a great win, the girls performed to expectations - this is how we know they can perform," Wilcox added.
"They pulled it out; it was a tight game, an exciting game and they pushed on when they were ahead, which was fantastic.
"I'm so proud of each and every one of them."
