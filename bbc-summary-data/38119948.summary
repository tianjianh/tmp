Provan was part of the team that landed the domestic treble in 1964 and he won two Scottish Cups and the League Cup.
A Rangers Hall of Fame inductee, Provan played in the European Cup-Winners' Cup final defeat by Bayern Munich in 1967.
"He was a huge part of the club for decades and he enjoyed a terrific playing career here," said Rangers managing director Stewart Robertson.
"On behalf of everyone at Rangers Football Club I would like to offer my sincere condolences to Davie Provan's family and friends.
"Davie worked at Ibrox for a number of years as a match-day host and was also a vital member of John Greig's backroom staff during his time as Rangers manager.
"His loss will be felt by everyone associated with the club and our thoughts are with Davie's son Graham, daughter Yvonne, and his two grandsons Callum and David at this difficult time."
Provan, capped five times for his country, went on to play for Crystal Palace and Plymouth Argyle before finishing his career with St Mirren.
