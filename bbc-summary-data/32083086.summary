Penzance RMT union strike over dismissal brings train delays

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Train passengers are facing delays to services after a 24-hour strike by First Great Western (FGW) staff over the dismissal of a manager.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Members of the RMT union in Penzance walked out at about 04:00 GMT and are also set to take 48 hours of industrial action from 06:00 GMT on Easter Sunday.
FGW said the man was sacked for breaching safety guidelines but RMT urged the train company to "see sense and reinstate" him.
Delays to services have been reported.
RMT General Secretary Mick Cash said: "It is clear that there is a culture of bullying and intimidation of staff in the money-spinning operation which is First Great Western.
"We will not allow this culture to go unchallenged."
