[SN]TITLE[SN]
Winnie-the-Pooh's adventure to Buckingham Palace

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Queen isn't the only one celebrating her 90th birthday this year, so is the famous bear Winnie-the-Pooh.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
To mark the occasion, a new story is being released, called 'Winnie-the-Pooh and the Royal Birthday'.
In the story Piglet, Pooh, Christopher Robin, and Eeyore all decide to go on an adventure to Buckingham Palace.
Along the way they meet Prince George, and Pooh even manages to bump into the Queen, and hums her a special birthday tune.
Winnie-the-Pooh was first published in 1926, and apparently the Queen was a big fan when she was a child.
