Trump's vice-president-elect: Who is Indiana Governor Mike Pence?

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Donald Trump's running mate, Indiana Governor Mike Pence, is leading the president-elect's White House transition team. Who is he?

Mr Pence is charged with leading the team deciding the key appointments in the new administration.
It's the second time he accepted a top job offer from Mr Trump.
The first time was in July, when the 57-year-old met Mr Trump and his family at his Indianapolis home, and was asked to join the ticket.
It's easy to see why he was asked. The governor is a favourite among social conservatives who boasts considerable experience in Washington.
But before being named as the vice-presidential pick, Mr Pence had criticised Mr Trump's proposed ban on Muslims entering the US as "offensive and unconstitutional" and called the business mogul's comments on US District Judge Gonzalo Curiel "inappropriate".
Mr Trump had suggested a judge's Mexican heritage prevented him getting a fair trial in a suit against Trump University.
Mr Pence was raised Catholic along with his five siblings in Columbus, Indiana.
He told the Indianapolis Star in 2012 that liberal icons John F Kennedy and Martin Luther King Jr inspired him to begin a career in politics.
The governor, who has described himself as "a Christian, a conservative and a Republican, in that order", voted for Jimmy Carter in 1980.
He has said it was not until college when he met his future wife, Karen, at an evangelical church that his views began to shift.
Mr Pence has served as governor of Indiana since 2013, but also has 12 years of legislative experience as a member of the US House of Representatives.
During his final two years in Washington, he served as the chair of the House Republican Conference, the third highest-ranking Republican leadership position.
He also chaired the Republican Study Group, a coalition of conservative House Republicans, which could give him a boost with some evangelicals of the party that have questioned Mr Trump's ideological purity, according to BBC's Anthony Zurcher.
The governor, who is up for re-election, also considered running for president in 2016.
This year is not the first time Mr Pence had considered a run for the White House. In 2009, he visited early primary states, fuelling speculation that he had ambitions for a 2012 run.
In the past few weeks, Mr Pence has been keeping a busy schedule alongside Mr Trump as he appears in rallies nationwide - often in a number of states per day.
One of his key roles has been supporting the candidate when controversies have erupted: in September alone, he defended Mr Trump when he appeared to suggest people take arms against presidential rival Hillary Clinton, and stood up for his son Donald Trump Jr over comments he made comparing refugees to Skittles.
In early September, he went against Mr Trump's long-held view that President Obama was not born in the United States (days later, Mr Trump said he too had changed his mind on this issue).
The governor sparked a public outcry after signing the Religious Freedom Restoration Act into law last March.
Critics argued the law discriminates against the LGBT community by allowing businesses to refuse service over religious beliefs.
Under national pressure, he later signed an amendment stating businesses could not discriminate against gay people, drawing criticism from conservatives who said they felt betrayed by the revision.
Mr Pence, an evangelical Christian and father of three, also signed into law one of the strictest abortion laws in the country in March.
Indiana joins North Dakota as the second US state to ban women from seeking an abortion if the child is born with a disability.
In 2012, the then-congressman likened the Supreme Court's ruling upholding the Affordable Health Care Act to the 9/11 terrorist attacks in a closed-door House Republican meeting.
He later apologised.
