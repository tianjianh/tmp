Muhammad, 26, clocked 53.13 seconds in rainy conditions to beat Dane Sara Slott Petersen (53.55) into second.
American Ashley Spencer ran a personal best of 53.72 to take the bronze medal, while Scot Doyle came home in 54.61 to finish eighth.
"I feel like I nailed the race," Doyle, 29, told BBC One. "I am not too unhappy but you always want more."
Doyle, victorious at the Diamond League meetings at Doha and Monaco this year, made a slow start from lane one and never troubled the leaders.
Muhammad's victory helped take the USA's gold-medal tally in Rio to nine.
"I was feeling really tired before the race, but I just trusted in myself and my abilities," she said.
