Raheem Sterling: Manchester City winger out for six to eight weeks

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Manchester City winger Raheem Sterling will miss about six to eight weeks with a groin injury, meaning he might not play again this season.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Sterling, 21, picked up the problem in City's 1-0 Premier League defeat against Manchester United on Sunday.
Eight weeks would see him return after the final day of the Premier League - 15 May - but before the Champions League final on 28 May.
England will monitor the player's situation in the lead up to Euro 2016.
The Three Lions squad for the tournament will be announced on 12 May and manager Roy Hodgson has until the end of that month to submit his final 23-man list.
City keeper Joe Hart should only be sidelined for about two weeks after picking up a calf injury in the United match.
