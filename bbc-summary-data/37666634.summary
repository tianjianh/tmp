The Glasgow Science Centre streamed the event to screens across the building after tickets to see the astronaut sold out in just 23 minutes.
Mr Peake spent six months in space on the Principia mission and became the first UK astronaut to go on a spacewalk.
He returned to Earth on 18 June.
During his space mission, Mr Peake ran science experiments for researchers from all over the planet - including trying to grow blood vessels and protein crystals.
He also used a furnace to melt and cool metal alloys as they floated in mid-air.
The Glasgow Science Centre said the astronaut wanted his mission to inspire people - especially children - to develop their interest in science.
