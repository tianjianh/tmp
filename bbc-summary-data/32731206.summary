The White House has praised Facebook's new policy to require a $15-per-hour (Â£9.53) minimum wage for contractors who do a "substantial amount of work" for the firm.

Facebook chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg made the announcement on Tuesday.
Contractors will have to provide 15 days leave and child benefit payments.
White House spokesman Josh Earnest said the move is an example of leadership on the topic of pay.
"This broader group will include workers who do substantial work for Facebook and who are employed by companies based in the US with more than 25 employees supporting Facebook," Ms Sandberg wrote in her blog.
"Research also shows that providing adequate benefits contributes to a happier and ultimately more productive workforce," she added.
