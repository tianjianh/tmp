[SN]TITLE[SN]
County Championship: Derbyshire and Leicestershire share even first day

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Harvey Hosein struck an unbeaten 79 as Derbyshire reached 282-8 on the opening day of their Division Two match against Leicestershire at Derby.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
After being put in, Alex Hughes' 55 helped the hosts to 124-2 before Charlie Shreck (3-67) and Neil Dexter (2-60) led a Leicestershire fightback.
But 20-year-old Hosein compiled his best first-class score before bad light brought an early end to the day.
Bottom side Derbyshire are still looking for their first win of 2016.
