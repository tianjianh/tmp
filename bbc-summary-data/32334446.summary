Naomi Long was speaking at the launch of the party's manifesto, ahead of the 7 May general election.
The document, Step Forward, Not Back emphasises policies aimed at promoting community relations.
Ms Long said representation for the party at Westminster would help it achieve its vision of a shared future.
She said the party would build on her achievements as an MP.
"In the next parliament, Alliance will continue our fight to provide the best future we can for everyone in Northern Ireland, ensuring their voice is heard and respected," she said.
The party said that a divided society cost public services an estimated Â£1bn per year and reducing it is part of their plans on public finance.
Alliance said they "accept the principle" that the UK's deficit should be reduced, but it should not be done solely by cuts to services.
They said a form of "progressive revenue-raising" should be considered by the Stormont Executive.
This would include proposals for a water charge, accompanied by a reduction in rates.
Party leader David Ford said the party was fielding 18 candidates in the general election to give everybody in Northern Ireland "the opportunity to vote for an Alliance candidate because we believe we have a unique vision and unique values".
Asked what the party would do in the event of a hung parliament, Ms Long said values would influence any decisions.

"I think that's how Alliance should approach any situation in the case of a hung parliament."
Alliance's other policies include:
