The children were recruited by the Cobra Faction and the SPLA In Opposition, two armed groups which have been fighting the government.
They were freed in the eastern region of Pibor and "disarmed and provided with civilian clothes," Unicef said in a statement.
About 16,000 children are still in "armed groups", it says.

I've seen many people killed when I was on missions.
I had an AK-47. It was heavy. I was fighting to protect my family and village.
Now I want to go to school and learn. I don't want to fight anymore, I was scared.
