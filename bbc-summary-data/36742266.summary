[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Global support for US President Barack Obama appears to have lasted through his two terms in office, a survey of 18,000 people for the BBC suggests.

More than 70% of people in 18 countries polled by Globescan think that his election was a good thing.
Of the 19 countries surveyed, only the Russians had a negative view of him, with an approval rating of 18%.
Countries with strong pro-Obama sentiments included Kenya, South Korea, the UK, France and Australia.
The poll also asked whether the election of a female American president would change people's view of the US.
Nearly half said yes, but they did not specify whether this was negative or positive.
More than 18,000 people worldwide were surveyed between December 2015 and May 2016.
Last week, a global poll by Pew Research also indicated high approval ratings for Barack Obama around the world.
