The 35-year-old Australian, who averages over 100 in the competition, has missed the last three games.
"I've taken the full three weeks to make sure the hammy's 100 % so I'm ready to go," Klinger said.
"We've come to win this tournament and believe we can get over the line against Hampshire."
After narrowly missing out on a last-eight place in the T20 Blast, Gloucestershire effectively sealed their quarter-final spot in the One-Day Cup by winning five games in a row.
"We've had good contributions with bat and ball," Klinger, who signed a new two-year deal at the club last week, told BBC Points West.
"Sometimes having a break can freshen you up mentally and physically so I don't think having a few weeks off will be an issue."
Hampshire, who are preparing for their sixth straight T20 Finals Day on Saturday, will also command respect in the 50-over format according to Gloucestershire head coach Richard Dawson.
"They've got a lot of good players and had a lot of success in one-day cricket - especially in the T20," he told BBC Radio Bristol.
"But we can take heart from our performance against them at Cheltenham (a five-wicket win) in the T20.
"It's a knock-out competition now and it's about who handles the pressure better."
Dawson also revealed the players have been picking the brain of the club's assistant coach Ian Harvey.
The former Gloucestershire all-rounder was a key part of the county's run of one-day success between 1999 and 2003  - the year he also won the World Cup with Australia.
"He played in a lot of big matches for Gloucestershire and brings the 'been there and done it' experience and that adds to it," Dawson said.
"We talk about bowling at the death and trying to improve it but a lot of it is down to player responsibility to go out and perform."
