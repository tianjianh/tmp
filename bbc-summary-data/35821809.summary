Kidderminster chairman Rod Brown says he wants interim head coach Colin Gordon to take the job permanently.

Gordon, 53, is also the National League club's major shareholder and chief executive, and has been in charge of the first team since Dave Hockaday left the role in January.
"I think what he's done with the players he's had has been amazing," Brown told BBC Hereford and Worcester.
"We haven't always had results, but the football's been the best I've seen."
Harriers have struggled all season in the aftermath of major financial problems and look certain to be relegated as they are 12 points adrift of safety at the bottom of the National League table with only nine games to play.
Gordon, who has stated that he does not want the head coach's job full-time, previously had a four-game spell in charge following Gary Whild's departure in September.
"Colin has a lot of interests in the football club and has a lot of skills," Brown continued. "He is not sure whether his skill-sets are right to be head coach, but I think he should be part of it.
"I can see his vision and the brand of football he wants to play and if I don't get him to do it, then second best thing would be that he's part of a team managing the club."

Brown admitted Harriers were effectively 'bust' last November before Gordon bought a majority stake in the club,  but over the last 12 months have filled a financial "black hole" of £300,000 and reduced the playing budget from a peak of £800,000 two seasons ago to £260,000 at the start of this term.
With the club now on the way to becoming self-sufficient, he is adamant they will remain a full-time outfit.
"We will break even this year - the first time in 15 years and that's very gratifying," Brown added.
"Full-time football can be sustainable and I've got no doubt the future is bright."
