Antonio Conte: Chelsea manager says Chinese football is a 'danger for all teams'

Chelsea manager Antonio Conte believes the huge money being spent on players by Chinese clubs is a "danger for all teams in the world".

Blues midfielder Oscar, 25, is close to a £60m move to Chinese Super League club Shanghai SIPG in January and is expected to receive an estimated £400,000 a week.
Conte said it would be "difficult" to manage a player on such a high salary.
Chinese clubs spent £200m before the start of the 2016 season.
The Chinese transfer record was broken three times in 10 days, as Chelsea's Brazil midfielder Ramires was signed by Jiangsu Suning for £25m, followed by Guangzhou Evergrande Taobao buying Colombia striker Jackson Martinez for £31m from Atletico Madrid.
Jiangsu then paid Shakhtar Donetsk £38.4m for Brazilian midfielder Alex Teixeira.
However, the fee for Teixeira was eclipsed by the £46.1m paid by Shanghai SIPG for Zenit St Petersburg's Brazil forward Hulk during the mid-season summer window.
The next Chinese transfer window opens on 1 January and closes on 28 February.
Arsenal midfielder Alexis Sanchez has been linked with a reported £500,000-a-week contract at Hebei China Fortune, managed by former Manchester City boss Manuel Pellegrini.
"The Chinese market is a danger for all teams in the world, not only for Chelsea," said Conte.
But speaking about the Premier League, he added: "This league is fantastic, a great opportunity [for players], a great honour and we should be very proud we play in this league."
Conte refused to confirm Oscar's move, saying: "I don't know exactly the amount, or the situation. Now we have to wait - when it is the moment you will know."
