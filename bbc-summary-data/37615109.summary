Chesterfield 0-1 Fleetwood Town

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Ched Evans came on as a substitute but was unable to prevent Chesterfield from slipping to a home defeat against Fleetwood.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The striker was included in the squad after he was last week found not guilty of raping a 19-year-old woman after a retrial at Cardiff Crown Court.
He came on in the 60th minute and had a shot tipped on to the crossbar, but Fleetwood full-back Conor McLaughlin scored the only goal of the match.
The Northern Ireland international drilled a low shot into the far corner after a good interchange with Ashley Hunter just as the Spireites had begun to build up a head of steam.
Prior to that, Gboly Ariyibi had curled a left-footed effort onto the post moments after Fleetwood had brought on sub keeper Alex Cairns for the injured Chris Neal.
Cairns, a former Chesterfield reserve, came on for only his second senior appearance five years after his previous one - also as a sub in a 5-0 home defeat for Leeds against Blackpool - and he made several great saves.
Chesterfield piled on the pressure late on but Uwe Rosler's side defended solidly to hold out for a second straight win.
