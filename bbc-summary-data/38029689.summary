The 25-year-old midfielder signed a two-year deal in 2015 after leaving Derby County.
"It's been a long time coming but it's signed and sealed," he said.
"I'm delighted. I just want to play as much as I can and try to get this club as high as they can as well. Hopefully we will stay in the league."
The Brewers are 18th in the table, four points above the relegation zone.
