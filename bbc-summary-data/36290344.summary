The intricately crocheted and knitted city includes landmarks such as Clifton Suspension Bridge, Bristol Zoo and SS Great Britain.
More than 250 volunteers have contributed - making everything from felt foxes to tiny boats and blue squares for the river.
It is the first time Briswool has been displayed as a completed model and will be on show at M Shed until 12 June.
