An 18-year-old woman was driving a Toyota Yaris when it was in a crash with a Ford Transit van on the A595 near Bootle at 19:55 BST on Friday.
She and her front seat passenger, also 18, were pronounced dead at the scene.
A third 18-year-old woman, in the back of the car, was flown by air ambulance to hospital where her condition is said to be "critical".
The 51-year-old man driving the van was also flown to hospital, where he is in a serious but stable condition.
The road was closed for six hours for the vehicles to be examined and then removed, Cumbria Police said.
The force is appealing for witnesses.
