The former champions' agreement also includes junior team Toro Rosso, who will switch from Ferrari for 2017.
Red Bull tried to split with Renault last year because of concern over the engine's performance.
However, the team has been encouraged by the French company's progress following its decision to return to F1 with its own works team.
The engine's latest development has increased its performance by about 30bhp, taking it well over 900bhp, and has powered Daniel Ricciardo to pole position for Sunday's Monaco Grand Prix.
The partnership won four consecutive drivers' and constructors' world titles from 2010-13.
Red Bull team principal Christian Horner said: "Our partnership has proved very successful over time.
"After the reconstruction Renault has undertaken, clear progress has been made which has made it logical to continue."
