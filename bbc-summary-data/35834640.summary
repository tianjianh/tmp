Ronny Deila & Celtic: Speculation disrespectful says Leigh Griffiths

Celtic striker Leigh Griffiths says he finds talk in the media about possible replacements for manager Ronny Deila disrespectful.

Griffiths says some of the criticism directed at the club this season has been understandable.
"I think the gaffer will just ignore it, but us as players, we get frustrated with it," he said.
"It is frustrating for us because it is disrespectful. The gaffer's got a job here and he's doing okay."
Reigning champions Celtic are only a point ahead of Aberdeen at the top of the Premiership.
They do have a game in hand and are in the semi-finals of the Scottish Cup, but they also had poor results in European competition this season and lost to Ross County in the semi-finals of the League Cup.
And former Celtic players David Moyes and Malky Mackay, plus Deila's predecessor, Neil Lennon, have been put forward as possible successors to Deila.
"We are still sitting top of the league, so for other managers to come in and say they're interested in the job when a guy is still in charge, it's poor from them," said Griffiths.
"We all know how difficult a treble is and it's unfortunate we couldn't do it again, but we are still in two competitions we can go and win."
Griffiths thinks Deila will shrug off the speculation, just as he has criticism of his playing style.
"He doesn't let things affect him and, if we are not playing well, he will stick to his guns because he knows it will work and it just takes time," said the Scotland striker, who has scored 35 goals in 43 outings this term.
"The performances this season haven't been great, but sometimes that happens in seasons and you've got to grind it out and on Saturday we played a lot better and hopefully that's a sign of things to come."
Deila himself insists that the speculation does not concern him and stresses that he has already started planning for next season.
"It doesn't frustrate me at all," said the manager. "The newspapers have to fill pages every day and all I'm thinking about is getting that double for Celtic and we have exciting games ahead.
"I feel very comfortable here."
