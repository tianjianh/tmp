A bus driver has been disciplined after making homophobic remarks over an open radio network during Belfast's LGBT Pride festival parade.

The driver used an offensive term for homosexuals while using his radio to talk to the bus firm's control centre.
He said he was unable to drive along one of the city's main streets because of the crowds at Saturday's event.
It was reported that when he was challenged, he stood by what he said by repeating the offensive comment.
In a statement, bus operator Translink apologised to its passengers and staff for the driver's "offensive language".
"We take incidents of this nature very seriously and we expect all our staff to deal with their passengers and colleagues in a friendly, helpful and professional manner at all times," Translink said.
"A full investigation has been carried out and appropriate action is being taken."
A whistleblower wrote to BBC Radio Ulster's The Stephen Nolan Show to highlight what had happened.
John O'Doherty from the Rainbow Project, a gay and lesbian support group, said the incident was an indication of the "everyday homophobia" that "still exists within our society" and which "in many ways is tolerated".
"It shouldn't be tolerated in the workplace especially in relation to public employers but the reality is in too many places and too many parts of our society it is still acceptable," Mr O'Doherty said.
He added that it was "hugely disappointing" that the comments had been made on the day of the Pride parade.
"It was such a positive day for our city.
"Tens of thousands of people came out on the street to celebrate an amazing community, an amazing culture and we've seen such positivity and such benefit to the people of this city as well, not least of all financially."
