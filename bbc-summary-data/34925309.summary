SensorSphere is a product its makers feel will solve that issue.
The small ball with a motor inside allows people to roll the camera around the house and look in different rooms.
Its modular design means different components can be added, such as smoke and noise detectors.
The camera was on show at CES Unveiled in New York, a preview of the CES tech extravaganza in Las Vegas which takes place in January 2016.
SensorSphere is in the prototype phase - right now the biggest challenge is in stabilising the camera footage.
The BBC's North America Technology Reporter Dave Lee saw SensorSphere in action.
