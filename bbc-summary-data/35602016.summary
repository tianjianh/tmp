Graycie was very poorly and brought to an animal hospital in Georgia, USA, a few weeks ago.
Since then her health's been improving but her vet Dr. Andy Mathis noticed she wasn't comfortable eating around people.
To get her more relaxed he took his own meal into her cage and ate alongside Graycie - even using a metal dog bowl for his own food.
It's hoped she'll feel more relaxed around humans and will soon find a new home too.
Watch the clip to see Graycie and Dr Mathis share a meal together...
