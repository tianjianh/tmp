Eric Snowden, director of design for Adobe, showed off the device at Apple's launch event on Wednesday by editing a photo of a woman's face.
The demo was met by applause in the auditorium, but was criticised online.
"Apple could have Photoshopped anything... coloured in the stripes on a zebra," wrote Biz Carson for Business Insider.
"Apple just wasn't aware enough of the connotations - especially in the context and scrutiny surrounding tech and diversity - to sidestep the landmine."
