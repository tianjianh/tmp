A girl accused of killing a mother and her daughter told police she and her co-accused had tried twice previously to kill them, a court heard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Elizabeth Edwards, 49, and her 13-year-old daughter Katie were found dead in Spalding in April.
The 15-year-old denies murder, but has admitted manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility, at Nottingham Crown Court.
A boy, also 15, has already pleaded guilty to murder.
Neither teenager can be named because of their ages.

On the second day of the trial a transcript of the girl's police interview was read.
She told officers she and her co-accused, who was 14 at the time, had planned the killing of Elizabeth and Katie Edwards in the days before their deaths on the evening of 13 April.
She also said they had attempted to carry out the killings on two other occasions.
The jury heard her tell police her co-accused had stabbed Ms Edwards in the neck and then smothered her before going into 13-year-old Katie's room and stabbing her.
The trial continues.
