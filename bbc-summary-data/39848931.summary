Lucy Bronze headed the opener following a free-kick and crossed for Izzy Christiansen to crash home the second.
Lloyd's header capped a fine 14-minute spell to make it 3-0 by the break.
Charlie Wellings' goal gave Birmingham brief hope, but Jill Scott's fierce shot sealed City's victory in front of a competition-record crowd at Wembley.
The 2016 Women's Super League champions are now in possession of all three main domestic honours - the first team to do so since Arsenal Ladies in 2011.
Birmingham had knocked out holders Arsenal and 2015 champions Chelsea to make the final, but the 2012 winners never looked like repeating that feat on their first trip to Wembley in front of 35,271 fans.
Before 2014, Manchester City Women had never lifted a major trophy - but they are now closing in on a potential clean sweep of all four domestic honours in the space of nine months.
Having won the WSL and Continental Cup last year, they will hope to add the WSL Spring Series to their Women's FA Cup success.
Manchester City, who also reached the Champions League semi-finals in May, had never even played in the top flight when Birmingham won the FA Cup in 2012.
City's relentlessly aggressive pressing game and dominant defence laid the foundation for a ruthless victory which was as good as sealed by the interval.
Birmingham's inability to retain possession under persistent pressure led to them conceding territory and numerous free-kicks and corners, where City's set-piece superiority twice told in a one-sided first half.
Moments after a near-post corner almost brought an opening goal for Megan Campbell with a neat flicked effort, Bronze darted in to convert Campbell's inviting inswinging free-kick for a 1-0 lead.
Bronze then bustled Paige Williams out of possession and picked out Christiansen with a delightful cross.
City's preference to stretch play and attack down the flanks had meant that, despite being 2-0 up, Lloyd was a peripheral figure for the opening 30 minutes.
She had shown glimpses of her technical ability and vision but made her quality count when she rose above flapping Blues keeper Ann-Katrin Berger to head home another Campbell cross following a short corner.
City stayed in control despite facing an improved Blues side after the break, with the lively Nikita Parris having a shot tipped wide and Steph Houghton sending a header off target.
Birmingham were rewarded for their efforts through Wellings' curled effort, but Scott showed some nifty footwork to fire in a fourth goal after good work by substitute Toni Duggan.
Manchester City captain Houghton, who will also lead England at Euro 2017 this summer, described the FA Cup as "the one we were missing" after their final triumph.
"Credit to all the girls and all the staff, we've worked so hard," she told BBC Radio 5 live. "We've had a tireless schedule, but we were the best team on the day.
"The aim was to win as many trophies with this team as I could. To be captain of this club is unbelievable - but to win the FA Cup at Wembley, it's what dreams are made of."
