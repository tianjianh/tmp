Newsbeat has seen new research from the Internet Watch Foundation warning that the age at which some children are taking part in indecent acts online is getting younger.
Now 16, Louise - not her real name - is being helped by experts from the NSPCC.
This is her story.
"When I was nine, that was the first time I went online. The site I used, it was kind of just one where you couldn't see anyone's faces.
"It was any name you wanted it to be.
"So I went on and I would lie about my age and say I was 14, and straight away there would be men of any age, like from 40 to 20.
"They would come up to me and it didn't matter that I said I was 14.
"They'd still all be in there asking to see, obviously, parts of my body.
"At the time, I did know it was wrong, but at the same time when an adult tells you to do something it was kind of just, 'OK, well this is an adult telling me to do it, so I'm going to do it.'
"So I didn't even really think about it, like, what I was doing.
"And then my mum and dad found out, so that all stopped. And it had all completely stopped until I was 12, then I used the same site again.
"At this point I knew I didn't have to lie about my age, because nobody had cared before anyway.
"I got into my first, what I considered a relationship. It went from zero to 100 in severity in about two days.
"One minute it was him just taking me into, we all had like our private rooms on the game, so he took me into his room and was just talking to me as a friend and the next minute I'd given him my MSN, my number.
"I hadn't even realised really how much I was giving. And within a week, we were in what I considered a relationship and probably within a week and a half he was already asking for pictures, for me to come on webcam.
"From then on if I didn't send a picture then I was doing something wrong. And if I did send a picture it was like, 'Well, just remember that I didn't ask for that picture, it was something that you wanted to send.'
"So at the same time I always felt like it was something, I was sort of leading him on, I was prompting everything.
"So I felt like I was in the wrong which is one of the reasons I didn't really tell anybody. Because I always thought that it was something I was doing, something I wanted."
Louise said from the ages of 13 to 15 she spent every day online talking to different men on different websites.
She said at 13, she became close with someone online who was eventually went to prison for four years.
"It was kind of an on and off thing for about two years. As friends we'd talk, and then he's asked to see me. One time, there was a dummy involved in a situation as a joke and I put it in my mouth and he found that really attractive.
"It was the weirdest thing. It was the weirdest scenario I've ever been in. But for some reason I felt I should do it to please him."
Louise said some of the men would talk about their children and jobs and didn't seem bothered about her age.
She believes that the topic needs to be addressed in schools, because children are active online and don't realise the dangers they can be getting themselves into.
"For parents, my parents always taught me stranger danger, if someone on the streets offers you sweets say no, if someone tells you to get in their car say no. Come home, tell somebody.
"Because in their day that was the danger. But now there's Facebook, there's all sorts. Now I could be in my room and I'm in more danger than I am outside at 11 o'clock at night on my own."
