US election: Donald Trump in excellent health, says his doctor

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Republican nominee Donald Trump is in "excellent physical health," according to a letter from his doctor.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Mr Trump released the note following a recent physical examination by Dr Harold N Bornstein.
The 70-year-old is listed as 6ft 3in (1.9 metres) and weighing 236lb (107kg).
The letter came as his rival Hillary Clinton returned to the campaign trail after time off with pneumonia appearing in North Carolina and Washington.
Boarding a plane in White Plains, New York, she spoke to journalists as she flew to North Carolina to hold a rally, her first campaign event since the weekend.

A history of US presidential bad health
Both candidates have faced public scrutiny over transparency about the state of their health.
"He takes a lipid lowering agent (rosuvastatin) and a low dose aspirin," the letter said. "He does not use tobacco products or alcohol."
His weight and height give him a body mass index of 29.5, according to US measurements, which is within the "overweight" range but close to the "obese" mark at 30.0.
Mr Trump discussed his health with talk-show host Dr Mehmet Oz in a taped interview, which aired on Thursday.
It's almost too perfect. The reality-TV-star-turned-politician sharing his medical information with the celebrity-doctor-turned-daytime-talk-show-host.
Mr Trump promised he would release information from a physical exam some time this week, and on Thursday - in a press release and a taped interview with Dr Mehmet Oz - he did.
Kind of.
We learned Mr Trump's vital signs are normal. He takes medication to keep high cholesterol in check. He passed all his cancer screenings He (perhaps not surprisingly) has higher than normal testosterone levels. He's a bit overweight and has a penchant for junk food. He says his exercise regimen consists of golf and giving political speeches.
Bornstein is the quirky man who made headlines last December when he claimed Mr Trump would be "the healthiest individual ever elected to the presidency". Bornstein later admitted he wrote that one-page, typo-ridden memo in less than five minutes.
In other words, this is hardly a full disclosure of Mr Trump's medical history. It's certainly in keeping with what has been an exceedingly bizarre US presidential campaign, however.
He first revealed the letter, which is dated 13 Sept, in his appearance on The Dr Oz Show.
"I feel as good today as I did when I was 30," Trump said on the show, according to a clip.
Dr Bornstein, a gastroenterological specialist at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York, has cared for Mr Trump since 1980, according to the letter.
The note continues to detail parts of Mr Trump's medical record, including that he was only in hospital once at age 11 for an appendectomy.
Although the letter provides some insight, it does not include his detailed medical history.
In an interview with the Washington Post released on Thursday night, Mr Trump revived debunked conspiracy theories about President Barack Obama's citizenship.
He refused to say whether he believes Mr Obama was born in Hawaii.
"I'll answer that question at the right time," Mr Trump told the newspaper. "I just don't want to answer it yet."
He also declared he was winning over the black electorate, saying he had "come up with African American voters like a rocket ship".

The polls indicate a tight race nationally and in the key battleground states, with 54 days to election day.
