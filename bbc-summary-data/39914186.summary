'Wrong type' of bins will be left full, council warns

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Residents using the wrong type of wheelie bin have been warned they will not be emptied due to safety concerns.

Mansfield District Council said bins not bought from the authority were more likely to break or fall off lorries while being emptied.
Lost, stolen or missing bins must be replaced at householders' expense and crews will now label and leave those which do not come up to standard.
Resident Peter O'Hare said houses with older, larger bins got a better deal.
Officials said bins bought elsewhere were often of lower grade plastic or had a larger capacity than the 180-litre council limit.
Hayley Barsby from the council said: "There have been occasions where bins have snapped or cracked when placed on the lifting equipment and sometimes they have fallen off while being lifted.
"This is obviously dangerous, not just to our staff but also the public, especially if this happens on a busy road.
"It can also leave a terrible mess if the bin falls off the lifting gear then spills all over the street."
Peter O'Hare, who lives in the Bull Farm area, said he had seen larger bins outside other houses.
"The bin men said they didn't do them any more but we are really struggling.
"We recycle, but with two adults and two children rubbish is a problem - I've had to pay someone else to take it away.
"Why should it matter if it's a private bin or a council bin if it does the job?"
