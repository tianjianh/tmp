[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A driver who knocked down an 80-year-old woman after failing to stop at a red light has admitted causing her death by careless driving.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Martin Cameron, from Clydebank, West Dunbartonshire, struck Margaret Mackell in the town's Glasgow Road in May 2013.
Mrs Mackell died in hospital from heart failure two months later but medics said the crash "potentially contributed indirectly" to her death.
Sentence on 58-year-old Cameron was deferred and his bail continued.
The High Court in Glasgow heard that retired nurse Mrs Mackell suffered from Alzheimer's, but still lived independently and had an active social life.
She was hit by Cameron's car as she returned from getting her hair done by students training at Clydebank College.
The widow was crossing the town's Glasgow Road as Cameron failed to stop at the red light.
Prosecutor Bruce Erroch said other pedestrians headed back to the pavement as Cameron's vehicle came towards them.
He told the court: "Margaret either did not see his car or had no time to react to its presence."
The pensioner ended up slumped on the ground before being rushed to hospital.
She was initially treated for fractures to her arm and leg but her condition deteriorated.
The pensioner, who had lived in Milngavie, East Dunbartonshire, returned to hospital where she ended up needing a number of blood transfusions.
In mid July 2013, she was found to have serious cardiac issues and days later she died.
The primary cause of her death was found to be heart failure.
However, a number of medics later agreed that her injuries "contributed or potentially contributed indirectly" to her death.
Cameron had originally faced an allegation of causing death by dangerous driving before prosecutors accepted his plea to the reduced charge.
