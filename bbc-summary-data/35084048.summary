[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man has been seriously assaulted in what police have described as a "vicious" attack in Linwood in Paisley.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
It happened at about 15:45 on Friday in the old Co-operative car park on Bridge Street.
The man was sitting in his silver Skoda Octavia when two men got out of a white Vauxhall Corsa and attacked him.
Police said it was "frightening" experience which happened when there were members of the public, including young children, about.
They have appealed for witnesses to come forward.
The victim suffered serious cuts to his hands and arms and was taken to the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley. He remains there, in a stable condition.
The first suspect was described as white, in his 20s, 6ft tall, of broad build, wearing dark clothing with a waist-length waterproof jacket.
The second man was also white, in his 20s, wearing dark clothing with a short waist-length jacket and a black and orange hat.
Det Sgt Ally Semple said: "The motive for the attack is still to be established. It was vicious and I have no doubt that the two suspects were determined to inflict serious injury to the man and cause significant damage to his car.
"It is entirely possible that he will be permanently scarred and could have long term impairment to his hands and arm as a result of the attack.
"This all took place in the middle of the afternoon in an area where members of the public, including young children, were about. Very frightening for anyone to witness, let alone experience."
He added: "The white Corsa, which we believe was fairly new; about two years old and had black alloy wheels, was driven at speed in to the car park and made off again, also at speed, so someone may have noticed it as a result."
