[SN]TITLE[SN]
'Depressed' mother in Stoke-on-Trent killed herself and two children

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A mother who killed herself and her two children was depressed because she mistakenly believed her eldest daughter had cancer, a coroner has concluded.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The bodies of Marta Galikowska, 27, and daughters Maja, five, and Olga, one, were found at a house on Sherwin Road, Stoke-on-Trent on 12 October last year.
The mother and girls were pronounced dead at the scene.
Coroner Ian Smith concluded they died from stab wounds and the girls were unlawfully killed by their mother.
He also ruled at North Staffordshire Coroner's Court that Mrs Galikowska committed suicide.
In a statement, Marcin Galikowska paid tribute to his wife and daughters.
"Marta was a fantastic wife and a loving mum who worshipped our daughters Maja and Olga," he said.
"My wife was a very special person who lit up my life. Maja and Olga were wonderful children whose smiles still shine brightly."
