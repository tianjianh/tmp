Singer Anastacia has been given the all-clear by a doctor to perform on Strictly Come Dancing this weekend after missing last week's dance-off.

The star had to change her salsa routine last week after tearing a scar from a double mastectomy in training.
The performance aggravated her injury, meaning she and partner Brendan Cole could not take part in the dance-off.
A statement said she has been given the green light for Saturday as long as her dance is "carefully choreographed".
The US singer had a double mastectomy in 2013 after being diagnosed with breast cancer for the second time.
A statement from "The A Team" said she visited the clinic of a breast reconstruction surgery specialist on Monday.
"The doctor again confirmed that there was a tear in the scar tissue, which although painful is not permanent," it said.
"She was given the all clear to dance this weekend with the caveat that the routine is carefully choreographed and she has been given the appropriate medication.
"Brendan was with her for her appointments and they have been filmed for this weekend's episode.
"The specialist will be monitoring her condition regularly and she will revisit them on Monday."
Anastacia is donating her fee from the show to cancer research, using the Cancer Research UK handle in a tweet: "im getting through this 4 one reason @CR_UK"
The statement continued: "So unless a doctor tells her she can't carry on, quitting would never be an option. Anastacia and Brendan are now in rehearsal."
Anastacia finished in the bottom two last week with DJ Melvin Odoom.
But her inability to perform for a second time meant the decision on who would leave the show was determined by the results of the viewers' vote, with the Kiss FM presenter and his partner Janette Manrara sent home.
