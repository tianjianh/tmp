Southampton's SeaCity Museum: Visitors almost halve

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Southampton's £15m SeaCity Museum has seen visitor numbers fall by almost half since it opened three years ago, its latest figures show.

A BBC Freedom of Information request has found that 78,000 people visited in the last year - its target was 115,550.
The fall has cost the council-run attraction £280,000 in the last financial year.
Since opening in April 2012, as part of Titanic's 100th anniversary, it has cost the authority over £700,000.
In a statement the council said: "Clearly we are disappointed that we did not achieve the anticipated visitor numbers."
The authority said it was carrying out research "to help us understand what will attract new customers to the venue".
It said it also hoped a new dinosaur exhibition would boost numbers over the summer.
The museum is dedicated to Southampton's maritime heritage and the Titanic which made its ill-fated voyage from the city in 1912.
The Heritage Lottery Fund awarded a £4.9m grant towards the cost of the museum - the rest of the £15m came from the city council.
