Ikechi Anya's first-half winner means manager Gordon Strachan has overseen successive away victories for the first time since March 2014.
Former Scotland striker Darren Jackson, who won 28 caps from 1995 to 1998, was in the Generali Arena on Thursday. Here he gives his marks out of 10 for each of the Scotland players.
This was possibly his best game in a Scotland jersey. He was absolutely outstanding. I'll give him a 9 but it was a "10" performance.
Defended exceptionally well, especially in the second half, and should have been awarded a penalty.
Again, he defended very well. The big striker Tomas Necid caused him problems but he coped admirably.
Like the other players at the back, Russell was given problems by the Czechs' attacks in the first half, but in the second half he defended comfortably.
Andrew was very subdued tonight, he didn't get forward as much as he normally likes to. It was one of his quieter games for Scotland.
Charlie wasn't on the ball too much going forward but defended very well, especially at set plays in the first half. When he moved back to play at left-back, his defending was composed.
Very much a captain's performance from Darren. Most of his work was defensive, although he tried to get up the pitch to push the players on. His experience, the way he talks to the younger players throughout the game, is very valuable.
He caused them all sorts of problems with his pace, he was always direct and it was a very composed finish for his goal.
Prague is a hard place to come for your debut, but Kenny looked confident. He always tried to get on the ball to support the strikers.
Very good performance. He worked incredibly hard and helped Alan Hutton in the first half up and down the pitch. His composure on the ball and his set plays were excellent.
Excellent. It was hard for him sometimes because the service wasn't great but he linked well with Kenny McLean and it was a fantastic ball through for Anya for the goal.
It's hard to give Paul a score. He only touched the ball a few times, having come on as a late substitute.
Barry came on and made a lot of good passes, and defensively he did well. Not in the game too much but what he did, he did well.
Very dangerous when he came on. He could have had two goals with headers. His pace was a real plus.
On his debut he held the ball up when it was getting scrappy and the service wasn't good. In the last few minutes it was great to see him run the clock down in the left-hand corner. He should be happy with how he played.
