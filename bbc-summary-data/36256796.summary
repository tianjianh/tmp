The 34-year-old was a World Championships runner-up with England's Anthony Clark in the 2006 men's doubles.
The same partnership collected European bronze in the same year.
Blair teamed up with fellow Scot Imogen Bankier to earn another bronze at the 2014 Commonwealth Games in Glasgow.
He and Bankier completed a hat-trick of Scottish National titles this year.
"I have been working with the young Scotland players for a while but now it is on a formal basis," said Blair.
"I suppose you can call me the apprentice coach but it's just nice to be giving something back to the sport."
