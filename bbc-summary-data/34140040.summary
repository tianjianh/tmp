Grimsby Oasis academy head steps down over results

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The head of an academy school in north-east Lincolnshire has stood down following recent results.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Dr Chris Rolph has been principal of the Oasis Academy Wintringham, Grimsby, since September 2013.
Ofsted rated the school as requiring improvement, though praised Dr Rolph's leadership, at an inspection in 2014.
Oasis Community Learning, which runs the academy, said Dr Rolph's decision had been a mutual one and said he would be missed by staff, pupils and parents.
John Murphy, chief executive of Oasis Community Learning, said: "In light of recent results , Dr Chris Rolph has made the difficult decision, in consultation with Oasis, to leave.
"Having developed teaching in learning in the academy, improved rates of progress and built a solid foundation for the future, he stated that he is stepping aside to allow for new energetic leadership that will maintain continuity from the last 2 years."
He said Dr Rolph would be replaced by Heidi Stennett as interim principal.
The group is also appointing Dr McMurdo, who was previously a head teacher in Peterborough, as executive principal.
