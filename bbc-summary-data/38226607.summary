Lopes, 26, has "traumatic deafness" after the incident at Metz that led to their Ligue 1 match being abandoned.
The French club are third in Group H on seven points, with Sevilla on 10.
Sevilla could top the group if leaders Juventus fail to beat Dinamo Zagreb.
The Italian champions are one point ahead of Sevilla and are at home to the Croatian club, who are yet to pick up a point.
French striker Wissam Ben Yedder scored the only goal as Sevilla won the reverse fixture 1-0 in September.
And Lyon face a difficult challenge to improve their fortunes at the Stade de Lyon after the weekend's drama, which left Portugal international Lopes in hospital.
Lopes has been cleared of permanent damage to his eardrums but it is unclear whether he will be fit for Wednesday's match.
"Lyon underline the fact that the whole squad... have been seriously shaken emotionally by this aggression," the club said.
Sevilla have been boosted by the return of former Arsenal and Manchester City playmaker Samir Nasri, who resumed training on Sunday after injury.
