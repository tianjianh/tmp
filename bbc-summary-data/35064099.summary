Brown, 27, marked his third touchdown in Sunday's 45-10 victory over the Indianapolis Colts by running full tilt into the goalpost, straddling it and then falling onto his back.
Brown has been ordered to pay a $11,576 (Â£7,631) fine by the NFL for his antics.
"They didn't like it too much," Brown told the Pittsburgh-Tribune Review.
Social media users did, however, with Brown's celebration provoking much mirth.
