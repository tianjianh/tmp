Chelsea captain John Terry said there has been "no communication" between him and the club despite boss Guus Hiddink suggesting he could stay.

Terry, 35, said last week that he had not been offered a new deal when his contract expires in the summer.
Asked after Sunday's 1-1 draw with Manchester United whether anything had changed, he told Sky Sports: "Not from my point of view."
He added: "I made it very clear I wanted to stay."
Since Terry suggested last weekend that he would leave, Hiddink appeared keen to discuss a possible contract extension with the centre-back.
But speaking on Sunday, Hiddink said was not going to speculate further.
Terry added: "It's a difficult one. The club is the most important thing. There is no communication between me and the club at the moment.
"I'll never forget my memories here and they will live with me forever."
Terry has been linked with moves to Qatar side Al Arabi - managed by his ex-Blues team-mate Gianfranco Zola - as well as Major League Soccer in the United States and the lucrative Chinese Super League.
