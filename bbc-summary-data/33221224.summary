The markings were painted on Lower Henley Road in Caversham by Reading Council last year in a bid to make the town more bike friendly.
But cyclists and the Reading Cycle Campaign said locating the narrow lane near parked cars was dangerous.
The council has admitted the lane has proved unpopular and will remove the markings at a point when other work is scheduled nearby.
Councillor Tony Page, deputy leader, said the scheme received no objections during a consultation.
But he conceded: "It was clear after [they] were installed that they were not popular, and a decision was made... to drop the schemes.
"The cost of removing the cycle lane markings will be significantly reduced by combining the task with any other scheduled works nearby.
"We will be holding off introducing any other schemes pending a review of this aspect of the cycling strategy."
Reading Cycle Campaign chairman Adrian Lawson has welcomed the move to scrap the markings.
He described the lane as "an accident waiting to happen" last year, saying:  "A cyclist is going to get knocked off by a door opening. It's making it more dangerous."
The council said it was doing its best with the town's limited road structure and it was committed to providing safe routes for cyclists.
