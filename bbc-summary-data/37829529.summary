Translink seeks opinions on a new transport hub for Belfast city centre

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Translink is consulting the public on proposals for a new transport hub in Belfast city centre.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The planned hub, which is still at the consultation stage, will be at the Europa bus centre/Great Victoria Street railway station.
The two stations are the busiest in Belfast, with about eight million passengers a year passing through them.
It is expected that figure will rise to 13 million in the next 14 years.
Translink described the Belfast Hub as a "transport-led regeneration project" which will consist of a "world-class transport interchange and surrounding masterplan development".
The site would cover 20 acres from the stations to the Royal Victoria Hospital.
Half of that would be used for an integrated transport hub and the other half would be open to commercial development.
Over the past 18 months, Translink has engaged with local stakeholders to help shape the development proposals and said this latest stage "invites the public to share their views on the proposals".
Launching the public consultation, Translink group chief executive, Chris Conway, said: "The Belfast Hub will ensure we have the right infrastructure in place to attract more people to use public transport and active travel modes, supporting a key outcome of the draft programme for government.
"Along with other key projects, it will enable a transformation in public transport making a positive impact for everyone in Northern Ireland.
"Identified as one of the NI Executive's flagship projects, this impressive new facility will act as a catalyst for regeneration in one of the special action areas designated in Belfast City Council's city centre and regeneration strategy, providing new jobs, investment opportunities and supporting the growth and prosperity of NI."
The public can contribute to the consultation in the following ways:
The consultation stage is open until 2 December.
Translink said a further consultation will take place in 2017 before a planning application is submitted.
