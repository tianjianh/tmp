The 27-year-old model, whose stage name was Carla Mai, died a week after being found critically injured in Chichester Terrace on 11 July.
A man aged 28 from Brighton was held on suspicion of attempted murder, while a woman, also 28, was quizzed over suspected drug offences.
Both were bailed until 5 September.
A Sussex Police spokesman said: "The 27-year-old woman who fell from a window of a Brighton flat has sadly died from her injuries at the Royal Sussex County Hospital on Monday July 18.
"The woman had been in a critical condition since she was discovered having fallen from the first-floor flat window in Chichester Terrace on Monday July 11 at 9.08am."
On Twitter, Daria Spencer wrote: "I can't believe that my sister has left us. She put up a fantastic fight and I will love her forever. Rip."
The MTV reality show Geordie Shore has been running since 2011.
