The Government has said it will look at calls for a new M4 junction in Bristol, in an attempt to ease congestion.

Campaigners said the ring road between Emersons Green and the M32 gets congested by traffic heading to the M4.
They have called for a new turn-off - junction 18A - saying it would offer direct access to the motorway and speed up traffic.
The Conservative MP for Filton and Bradley Stoke, Jack Lopresti, raised the issue in the House of Commons.
He asked transport Minister Andrew Jones what the likelihood was of a new junction being created "which will support job creation as well as reducing traffic congestion".
Mr Jones replied that he had seen examples "up and down the country" where similar road projects have "unlocked growth and created jobs".
Earlier this week a 1,100 signature petition was handed to Secretary of State for Transport, Patrick McLoughlin MP, by several local MPs.
"I know it was very fruitful meeting with the secretary of state, and he has asked Highways England to take a close look at this," Mr Jones added said.
