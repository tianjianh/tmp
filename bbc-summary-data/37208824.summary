Sam Allardyce surprised the boys from Jersey when they were given a tour of Wembley Stadium.
Harlan Moss, aged 11, and Jonathan Trant, 10, said in their application they would give "100% effort" to coaching the team.
"They were all very knowledgeable about the game," Allardyce said.
The boys, from St George's Preparatory School, were allowed to quiz Allardyce on his new role after he made the surprise appearance when the boys were given a tour of his office.
"If they stay focused and keep working hard then you never know, they could be in my position in 30 years," Allardyce said.
The application was one of 700 submitted for the job, which became available after Roy Hodgson resigned following England's defeat by Iceland at Euro 2016.
In their letter, Harlan and Jonathan explained how they would act as joint coaches, with their friends James Douglas, Felix O-Connor and Bertie Cooke, all aged 10, taking on more specialist roles.
"My management team and I would absolutely love being the coaches for England," the letter read.
"We will promise you that we will give 100% effort, 100% getting the squad right and 100% commitment in getting our legends fully fit.
"I am confident in my coaching staff and we promise that we will do the best we can to bring success to English football," it finished.
