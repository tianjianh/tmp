[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 96-year-old announced his retirement in May, after decades of supporting the Queen, as well as attending events for his own charities and organisations.
Prince Philip has completed 22,219 solo engagements since 1952.
On Wednesday, he will meet servicemen who have taken part in a 1,664-mile trek in aid of charity.
As Captain General of the Royal Marines, the duke will attend a parade to mark the finale of the 1664 Global Challenge - a series of strength and endurance challenges raising funds and awareness for charity.
While his diary of engagements will come to an end, Buckingham Palace has said the Duke may still decide to attend certain events alongside the Queen in the future.
The Queen's public schedule will continue as normal.
