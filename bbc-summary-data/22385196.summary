[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Prince Charles has visited his sustainable model village to mark the Dorset development's 20th anniversary.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Prince of Wales celebrated two decades since work started on the Poundbury extension to Dorchester, which is based on his planning ideals.
The development combines social and private housing with work and leisure facilities and is designed to put the needs of people before cars.
Poundbury is set to be complete by 2025 when it will house about 5,000 people.
The prince attended a reception before taking a walking tour of Poundbury with invited guests.
He viewed an exhibition of photographs reflecting how the development and its community had changed in the last decade, before joining a celebration with residents.
The prince's visit also included a tour of Cambridge Court, a block of seven self-contained flats for adults with learning disabilities, where he unveiled a plaque to mark its official opening.
The development, built on Duchy of Cornwall land, is already home to about 2,000 people and has provided about 1,600 jobs.
