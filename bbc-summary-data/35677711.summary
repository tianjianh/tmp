Wasps' Ricoh Arena: 'Rugby specials' to run to stadium

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Rugby fans originally told they could not use a new station at Coventry's Ricoh Arena can use a trial rail service this weekend.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Rail firm London Midland is running the service for fans going to the Wasps' game against Harlequins on Sunday.
Rugby and football fans had been told they could not use the station, which opened in September, as it shuts for an hour after major events.
But a trial service is being run on Sunday and on 12 March.
The hourly passenger train which serves the stadium has 75 seats - the stadium has a capacity of 32,600.
London Midland said it would be running match-day specials between Coventry and Nuneaton, calling at the arena, and would include a six-carriage train providing an extra 1,000 seats before and after the game.
Steven Fisher from London Midland said the firm had no additional trains for match days, but had chartered services to test the idea of running rugby specials.
The two trial days will be reviewed before any next steps are decided on.
