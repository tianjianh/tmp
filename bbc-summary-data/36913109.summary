About 100 Tata steelworkers gathered for a meeting in Port Talbot on Thursday evening to discuss the latest developments in the efforts to secure the future of the plant.

It came after the company entered negotiations with the German firm ThyssenKrupp over a merger.
Tata has put the sale of its Welsh operations on hold in the meantime.
The meeting was organised as unions are increasingly frustrated with how the process is being handled.
Alan Coombes of the Community Union said the meeting "went well" and it was "important to give people an opportunity to ask questions".
Steelworker and union representative Mark Davies said: "We've given some information to the workforce but we can't answer all their questions.
"We want to reassure the workforce the unions are doing all we can to fight for this business."
On Wednesday, the management buy-out team Excalibur said it would remain in the bidding process.
It said its objective was "to save jobs, protect threatened communities and preserve primary steel-making capacity in the United Kingdom".
