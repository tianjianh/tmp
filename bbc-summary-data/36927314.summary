Two firms 'show interest' in threatened Greenock plant

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Two firms have shown interest in the threatened Texas Instruments (TI) site in Inverclyde, according to a task force set up to try to save the plant.

Hundreds of jobs have been under threat since January, when TI announced the phased closure of its Greenock plant.
The semiconductor firm plans to move production to "more cost-effective" sites overseas over three years.
Texas Instruments Task Force chairman Stephen McCabe said there had been interest from two prospective buyers.
Mr McCabe, who is also leader of Inverclyde Council, said: "With the Texas Instruments Greenock plant being actively marketed, there have been two businesses interested in examining the site.
"This is very hopeful news that there is some interest being expressed by potential buyers within the industry.
"A note of caution is clearly required. This is a very specialised industry with a limited number of businesses operating globally."
News of the potential buyers was raised at the last meeting of the task force, which is supported by the Scottish government, national agencies and local and national politicians.
About 365 people currently work at the Greenock facility. The jobs affected are in manufacturing, engineering, support and management.
