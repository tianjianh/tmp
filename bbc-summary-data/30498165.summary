MK Gallery is to use the funds to double exhibition space and provide new education and community facilities.
Three new cinema screens to show independent film will also be built.
Programmes will expand to include historical as well as contemporary exhibitions, film, talks, community and schools visits and events.
Director Anthony Spira said: "This opportunity will enable the gallery to diversify its programme and to engage with much larger audiences."
Hedley Swain, from Arts Council England, said: "MK Gallery plays a key role in bringing more arts and culture to the region and makes an important contribution to contemporary visual arts.
"We are pleased to be able to support the gallery in its continued development and expansion through our capital programme, enabling them to be more resilient and also helping to develop and widen both its audience and artistic offer."
Sarah Betteley, of Milton Keynes Council, said it was "excellent news" for the town.
