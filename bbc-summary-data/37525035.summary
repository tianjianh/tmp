Derry City manager Kenny Shiels says the "cards are stacked in Dundalk's favour" ahead of Sunday's FAI Cup semi-final between the sides at Oriel Park.

"They have a fantastic squad and a financial conveyer belt coming from their European exploits, which they have earned," said Shiels.
"They have huge advantages over us and we are the underdogs but that doesn't stop us from thinking we can win.
"We have lost our last two against them but we must believe we can win."
The last of those two defeats for the Candystripes came in a 3-1 reverse in the Premier Division at the same venue just a few weeks ago.
"They were better than us that night and they will be buoyant after that, so we have had a lot of preparation to do this week.
"They also know how to play on their pitch and it's difficult for teams going there, but we will regard it as a huge challenge.
"Players should not need motivation for an FAI Cup semi-final, given the reward for the winners, so we will go there and try to create the impossible."
Derry, who reached the last four stage by beating Wexford Youths in the quarter-finals, have appeared in 10 finals to date, winning five of them.
League of Ireland champions and leaders Dundalk enjoyed a 1-0 win over Israeli side Maccabi Tel Aviv in the group stages of the Europa League on Thursday night.
St Patrick's Athletic host Cork City in the other semi-final on Sunday.
