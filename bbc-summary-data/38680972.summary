The fee for the 17-year-old is understood to be around Â£750,000.
Bedeau moved to the Shakers last summer after he was released by Leyton Orient and has made seven appearances since his debut in November.
Bury boss Chris Brass said youngsters George Miller, Callum Styles and Scott Burgess were also attracting interest.
"I'd be surprised if we managed to keep hold of them all, I genuinely would," Brass told BBC Radio Manchester.
"The interest that has been shown is on a major level, it is not just paper talk."
