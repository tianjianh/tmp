Scott Diver, from Clydebank, was last seen on 17 September by his father at home.
One week on, officers have carried out a "stop and speak" in the West Dunbartonshire town.
They talked to locals near the teenager's home, around Clydebank Shopping Centre and at the bus station on Chalmers Street.
Since Scott's disappearance, police said they had been using an air support unit and search teams to try and find him.
The teenager is described as being 5ft 7in tall, with a slim build, dark hair and blue eyes.
When last seen, he was wearing a navy blue Adidas tracksuit with light blue stripes down the arms and legs, a white t-shirt and navy Adidas training shoes with grey stripes.
Insp John Mullen said, "We are becoming increasingly worried about Scott as he has not made contact with anyone in almost a week.
"We've been carrying out a significant number of enquiries to trace Scott's movements and we are utilising a range of specialist services available to us including the air support unit and search teams.
"I hope that by visiting the areas where Scott was last seen or known to frequent, someone will remember seeing him."
Police have urged anyone with information about the teenager's whereabouts to come forward.
