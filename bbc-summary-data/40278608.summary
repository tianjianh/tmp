Marek Stech: Luton Town sign former Yeovil goalkeeper

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Luton Town have signed Czech Republic international goalkeeper Marek Stech on a two-year contract.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Stech returns to England after three seasons at Czech club Sparta Prague, where he made only seven appearances.
The 27-year-old previously played for Yeovil in the Championship, and made his international debut against Austria in 2014.
During his loan spell at Yeovil in 2011, Stech was a team-mate of Luton manager Nathan Jones.
Having started his career with his hometown club Sparta, Stech signed for West Ham in August 2006, but he made only three appearances for the Hammers over six seasons.
He spent brief loan spells at Wycombe, Bournemouth, Leyton Orient and Yeovil before signing a permanent deal at Huish Park ahead of the 2012-13 season.
Stech made 85 appearances for the Glovers and helped them win the League One play-off final in 2013, before returning to Sparta a year later, after Yeovil were relegated.
