Live Great North Run updates.
The 13.1-mile run, has grown from 12,000 runners in 1981 to 57,000, many of whom raise money for charities.
Beginning in Newcastle, the half-marathon course finishes at South Shields and takes in iconic sights including the Tyne Bridge.
The men's wheelchair race was won by Mark Telford and the women's race by Vivian Cheruiyot.
The event also featured participants from 178 UN member states, more than any other running event in history, organisers say.
Rock bands Kaiser Chiefs and Kodaline, which has a band member taking part in the run, will perform at the inaugural "run, rock and raise" event at the Newcastle Metro Arena, with charities benefitting from the money raised.
The run completes a weekend of events including the Great North 5K, mini and junior Great North Run and the Great North City games, which took place on Tyneside on Saturday.
Earlier on Sunday morning, paralysed woman Claire Lomas who started her Great North Run on Wednesday wearing a "bionic suit" completed the route in South Shields.
