League of Ireland: Derry City v Drogheda Utd (Sat)

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Derry skipper Ryan McBride is a doubt for Saturday's Premier Division clash against Drogheda because of illness.

The defender scored in Monday's win over champions Dundalk which maintained City's perfect start to the season.
"Ryan played with flu against Dundalk - he vomited at half-time and had chest pains. He's a possibility rather that probability," said boss Kenny Shiels.
Injured pair Rory Patterson and Conor McDermott are ruled out but Lukas Schubert returns for the Candystripes.
Derry have also chalked up wins over Bohemians and Shamrock Rovers to lie second in standings and with a game in hand on leaders Cork City.
Drogheda are three points behind City and Shiels has warned against complacency in the Maginn Park game.

Shiels is also concerned that the atmosphere in the ground may be affected by a Saturday afternoon kick-off.
He added: "When you win your first three games and then you are playing a team which is not Dundalk, Shamrock Rovers or Limerick - you can take your eye off the ball.
"We've been hammering it into the players how important the Drogheda game is and how difficult it is going to be.
"I've gone to Irish League games on a Saturday afternoon and there is not the same passion coming from the stands.
"I'm concerned about it and we've got to try to lift the whole place."
