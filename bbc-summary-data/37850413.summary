Jonathan Pay, 46, shot a man who wrestled him to the ground during the failed raid - leaving a pellet lodged in the base of the victim's skull.
A second robber stabbed the 50-year-old before both men fled the Lloyds Bank branch in Liphook, Hampshire, on 16 May.
Pay was jailed for 16-and-a-half years at Winchester Crown Court.
Pay, of Liphook Road, Lindford, had previously admitted wounding with intent, having an imitation firearm with intent and two counts of attempted robbery.
The customer, who has asked not be named, said Pay held the gun to his wife's head before pointing it at bank staff.
He said: "I had him on the floor and nearly got the gun off him but his friend stabbed me and he shot me in the face.
"I dragged him out of the bank then he came back in and shot me again through my hair-line.
"It was adrenaline, complete instinct. I though my life was going to end in the bank."
The victim, from Headley Down, was treated in hospital for a minor stab wound, but he said the pellet could cause facial paralysis if removed, because it was embedded in a major nerve cluster.
He said his wife now "shakes all the time" and was unable to go shopping on her own.
Det Con Kat Bird said the couple had been nominated for bravery awards.
She said: "That customer tackled Pay to the ground causing his face to be uncovered and dislodging sunglasses which later forensically linked him to the offence.
"The man's wife also grabbed a bag containing gloves and a balaclava, which Pay was carrying.
"These items, which he had forgotten to put on, also forensically linked him to the scene."
She said detectives were still trying to establish the identity of the second robber.
