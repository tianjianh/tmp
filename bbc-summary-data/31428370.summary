The controversial programme, accused by some of exploiting its participants, is one of four up for the guild's best documentary series award.
Keeley Hawes, Toby Jones, James Nesbitt and Sheridan Smith are among those in contention for acting honours.
The prestigious awards will be handed out at a ceremony at the Theatre Royal Drury Lane in London on 13 March.
Benefits Street will compete for its prize against ITV's Broadmoor and two other Channel 4 programmes - 24 Hours in Police Custody and Grayson Perry: Who Are You?
The drama series prize sees three BBC shows - Happy Valley, Line of Duty and The Honourable Woman - nominated alongside ITV's biographical drama Cilla.
The single drama award pits Dylan Thomas drama A Poet In New York against Toby Jones' Marvellous, BBC Three's Murdered By My Boyfriend and ITV's Tommy Cooper: Not Like That, Like This.
Last year's awards saw ITV thriller Broadchurch take home three awards - one for best drama series, one for lead actress Olivia Colman and a writing award for creator Chris Chibnall.
A full list of this year's nominations is available on the BPG website.
