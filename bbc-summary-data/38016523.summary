Royal Berkshire Hospital: Regulatory action ends after breach

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An NHS body has ended regulatory action on the quality of services at a hospital in Berkshire.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
NHS Improvement said services at the Royal Berkshire Hospital in Reading, including shorter waiting times and an increase in the number of staff, had "significantly improved".
The trust was previously investigated for breaching the NHS's four-hour waiting target for A&E services.
The watchdog said it still had concerns about the trust's finances.
The trust was found in breach of its licence to provide healthcare services in December 2014, following concerns raised by the Care Quality Commission.
Graham Sims, trust board chair, said staff should "be proud of the work they have done" and the board would "remain focussed on high quality care and delivering on financial promises".
The Royal Berkshire NHS Trust runs hospitals in Reading, Bracknell, Windsor and Henley.
