[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Christopher Hogg, 26, was part of a gang which carried out the attack in Hamilton on 4 November 2015.
One victim, James Nicol, was repeatedly beaten, lost consciousness and spent 10 days in hospital. The other, Brian Ashbridge, was left badly bruised.
Hogg admitted a charge of assault to severe injury and danger of life.
He had originally been charged with attempted murder but his guilty plea to the lesser charge was accepted by prosecutors.
Jailing him at the High Court in Edinburgh, judge Lord Clark told Hogg: "You have pled guilty to charges that, while acting with others and armed with weapons, you forced entry to a flat and assaulted two men.
"One of the men in the flat, James Nicol, was pursued into the kitchen and a brutal and sustained assault was carried out on him."
The judge said that those who armed themselves with potentially lethal weapons and forced entry to someone's home in an attack must expect to be severely dealt with by the courts.
