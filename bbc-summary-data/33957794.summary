The RSPCA was called after a member of the public heard the six-month-old animal "screaming in pain" in Ardingly Road, Saltdean, East Sussex on Sunday.
Officers alerted fire crews, who spent an hour knocking down part of the garage wall in the early hours.
"There was no way he was getting out by himself," said RSPCA inspector Marie Steven.
"It was touch-and-go whether this little animal was going to survive this mishap, due to how severely he was wedged into that tiny space.
"He was completely pinned by his head, shoulders and hips," she added.
"The fire and rescue team from Rottingdean did a fantastic job. They spent more than an hour bashing through the garage wall to reach him unscathed. They had to remove bits of concrete, as the fox couldn't be reached at all.
"I was so relieved when we got to him and found him uninjured. We checked him over, and gave him some food and water, and were then able to release him back into the wild to live another day, seemingly unperturbed by the whole middle-of-the-night adventure."
