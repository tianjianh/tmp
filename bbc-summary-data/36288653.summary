Former Wales Under-17 defender White, 19, only made five appearances for Wrexham last season.
Midfielder Royle, 21, has featured just once for the Welsh side, who finished eighth in non-league's top flight.
"We have fought off a number of clubs to get them signed. I believe they both have great potential," Southport boss Andy Bishop told the club website.
