A search operation was launched after a fishing vessel saw the kayak floating about three miles offshore with no-one on board at 17:45 on Friday.
A man was subsequently spotted in the water off Musselburgh, close to where the River Esk flows into the Firth.
Aberdeen Coastguard said that a search and rescue helicopter recovered the man's body from the water.
Police Scotland said that they had been called to Goose Green Place, near the shore in Musselburgh, after the man was found.
A police spokesman said: "Inquiries are continuing to establish the full circumstances surrounding the death."
The RNLI Kinghorn lifeboat, two fishing vessels and search and rescue helicopter 131 from RAF Boulmer had been involved in the search.
The kayak had been found about three miles off Port Seton.
