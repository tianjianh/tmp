That's what American Idol contestant Jackie "Jax" Cole, one of the final eight women on the long-running show, hoped anyway.
But it backfired a bit.
After performing her jazz version of ain't No Mountain High Enough, Jennifer Lopez was scathing about her singing, saying it "didn't work". But hey - she liked #TheDress and it got the judges talking.
Harry Connick Jr also criticised the 18-year-old's performance, although and Keith Urban liked it. Watch the track on YouTube.
But host Ryan Seacrest wasn't interested in letting them talk about her version of Marvin Gaye's classic track. He wanted to talk about #TheDress - obvs.
"Is this the dress that broke the internet?" he asked.
"I see blue and black," he said pointing at the dress while comparing it to a photo of #TheDress on his phone.
"What do you see in your monitors? In this [pointing to the phone picture] I see white and gold."
Lopez agreed with him but fellow singers Harry Connick Jr and Nicole Kidman's other half, country singer Keith Urban, saw something completely different.
"It's red and pink," said Urban.
"I see a hot guy holding a cell phone," shouted Connick Jr, as Seacrest ushered New Jersey native Jax off the stage.
