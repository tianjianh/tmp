Celebrated British composer Sir Peter Maxwell Davies, a former Master of the Queen's Music, has died at the age of 81.

He was known for his modern and avant-garde works, most notably Farewell to Stromness, a haunting lament for solo piano.
"He was right to the end a pioneer," Stephen Lumsden, Managing Director of music agency Intermusica, said.
The Salford-born musician, who had leukaemia, died at home in Orkney.
Famous for pushing boundaries, Sir Peter's earlier works have been described as unplayable, generating controversy among audiences and critics alike.
He often referenced plainchant and medieval music, which he incorporated into avant garde serial compositions (simply put, pieces which repeat passages over and over for a significant period of time).
But he made it his mission to connect with as many audiences as possible over his career, writing pieces for children, ballet, theatre and string quartet.
Known to most as Max, he composed some 300 works, including 10 symphonies, 10 so-called Strathclyde Concertos and the operas Taverner, The Lighthouse and Eight Songs for a Mad King.
He moved to the Orkney Islands in the early 70s, leading to a calmer style of music, which often incorporated Scottish motifs.
In 1987 he was knighted, and in 2004 he became Master of the Queen's Music - a post considered to be the musical equivalent of the poet laureate.
The holder is expected to write music to commemorate important royal events.
In the 2014 New Year Honours List he was made a Member of the Order of the Companions of Honour for "services to music". Last month he was awarded the Royal Philharmonic Society Gold Medal, considered to be the highest accolade the society can bestow.
As a conductor, Davies held positions at the BBC Philharmonic and Royal Philharmonic orchestras and appeared with many major orchestras in Europe and North America.
He was also a proud advocate of classical music and music education.
"The roots of a thriving classical music scene need three nutrients," he said in the 2005 Royal Philharmonic Society Lecture. "The first is music education, and the second, resources...  The third nutrient is new music. Classical music cannot become a museum culture."
"Max was a truly unique musician," said Sally Groves, a close friend and former creative director of sheet music shop Schott Music.
She added that he was "a remarkable composer who created music theatre works of searing power, great symphonies, intense chamber music, works of truly universal popularity" and "a fierce fighter for music in the community and in education, and on environmental issues".
Sir Peter was diagnosed with an aggressive form of leukaemia in 2013, but continued to work through successive rounds of chemotherapy.
His tenth symphony, premiered in 2014, his 80th birthday year, was seen as a reply to the illness.
"It felt as if Maxwell Davies was simultaneously bowing his head to mortality, and shaking his fist at it," said Ivan Hewett, reviewing the work for The Telegraph.
The composer's most recent work was an opera for children called The Hogboon, which will be premiered by the London Symphony Orchestra on 26 June.
"His vision for music education and the wealth of wonderful pieces he has left for young people is unparalleled in recent times," said the LSO's managing director, Kathryn McDowell. "He will be sorely missed."
BBC Radio 3 will be pay tribute to Sir Peter on today's edition of In Tune, live from 16:30 BST.
