The 32-year-old sustained the injury in the draw with Charlton Athletic on 11 February, and is due to undergo surgery this weekend.
"We had that news on Wednesday morning which was a bit of a blow, particularly for Barry," Dons boss Neal Ardley said.
"This puts him out for more than a five-month period. Barry is very influential and will be missed."
