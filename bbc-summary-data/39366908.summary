Worcester Warriors have extended Australian-born England-qualified scrum-half Michael Dowsett's contract.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 25-year-old initially moved to Sixways in November last year on a short-term deal to provide cover for the injured Francois Hougaard.
Dowsett has played eight times since joining from Australian Super Rugby side ACT Brumbies.
"Michael has shown tremendous professionalism," director of rugby Gary Gold told the club website.
"He provides important competition in the half-back position and he's a hungry, enthusiastic individual who drives standards across the board."
