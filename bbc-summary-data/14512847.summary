The 19-year-old has signed a "long-term contract" to move from his homeland for an undisclosed fee.
Campbell scored for Costa Rica against Bolivia in this summer's Copa America and has six international caps.
"It is a dream come true to play for such a big club in England and I want to do well for myself and Costa Rica," Campbell said.
"I am ready, I am very happy to be here and I want to focus on doing well for Arsenal.
"I'm good in one-on-ones and I am a player who knows how to score goals. I play forward and I can play on both sides.
"Arsene Wenger is a manager of immense quality. I took this decision because I know I have a possibility to become a better player here."
Arsenal announced they were close to signing Campbell on 12 August.
Speaking at that time, Wenger said: "[He] has shown that he is a player with great ability, and has performed well on the international stage at a young age.
"We look forward to the formalities of the transfer being completed and working with Joel when he joins us at Arsenal."
