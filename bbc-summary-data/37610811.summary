The players visited the memorial garden to pay their respects before rejoining their clubs.
The village was devastated in 1966 when a colliery waste tip collapsed, with slurry engulfing Pantglas Junior School on the last day before half term.
Manager Chris Coleman described the visit as "humbling".
"In a small way we wanted to show our respect and reflect on the tragedy of 50 years ago," he said.
"It puts everything into perspective."
