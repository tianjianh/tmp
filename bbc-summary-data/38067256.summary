[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A dominant Exeter sent Worcester to a fourth successive Premiership defeat as they ran in eight tries at Sandy Park.

Exeter surged into a 24-3 lead at half-time courtesy of tries from Jack Yeandle and Will Chudley before a penalty try as a maul was brought down.
Olly Woodburn, Carl Rimmer, Thomas Waldrom, James Short and Ian Whitten then all crossed after the break.
Worcester did find time for three consolation tries from Josh Adams, Wynand Olivier and Dewald Potgieter.
Exeter have won all nine of their Premiership encounters against the Warriors and move to within a point of the top four after back-to-back bonus point wins.
Their latest victory almost mirrored the previous league meeting between the two sides at Sandy Park in April, when the Chiefs also scored eight tries in a 50-12 victory.
Once again they were on top from the off against an injury-ravaged Warriors side, who were also without a number of players on international duty.
Chiefs fly-half Gareth Steenson was perfect off the tee, kicking 15 points from seven attempts before making way for Joe Simmonds.
Worcester have just one victory in their past eight matches in all competitions with only winless Bristol keeping them off the bottom of the table.
Exeter assistant coach Ali Hepher:
"It was a tough pre-season but the defeat against Clermont (last month) was the turning point. Since then, the guys have improved and they are now mentally in a great place.
"We are pleased with the performances in the last two or weeks, but we are disappointed to have conceded three tries as it doesn't improve our stats.
"It was great to introduce some of our youngsters but we did lose a little bit of direction, which they will learn from.
Worcester director of rugby Carl Hogg:
"We struggled to defend against their power and pace as we couldn't make tackles behind their gain line so they had plenty of quick ball.
"This put their big ball carriers on the front foot and they caused us a lot of damage.
"Exeter made a slow start to the season but they are now very much in form and we gave them an easy and an early opportunity for them to gain momentum."
