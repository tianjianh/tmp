101-year-old women in hospital trolley waits

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Two women, both aged 101 years old, have each had to spend more than 24 hours on a trolley in two separate hospitals in the Republic of Ireland.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A woman from County Clare was taken by ambulance to University Hospital Limerick last week.
But her family said it was more than a day before she was given a bed.
At Tallaght Hospital in Dublin, another 101-year-old woman was left on a trolley for 26 hours.
The hospital is reviewing that case.
Mary Fogarty, Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation, called for a review at University Hospital Limerick.
