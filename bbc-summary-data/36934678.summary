Warrington stretched his unbeaten record to 24 wins with a ninth-round stoppage of the Irishman to set up a possible world title bout.
Hyland, 32, failed to make the weight, which would have negated a title win, but that never looked likely as Warrington, 25, dominated throughout.
Dillian Whyte beat David Allen for the WBC International heavyweight title.
Londoner Whyte, 28, was an emphatic winner by a unanimous decision as he took his career tally to 18 wins from 19 fights.
On the undercard, Commonwealth champion Luke Campbell beat Argenis Mendez of the Dominican Republic to claim the vacant WBC silver lightweight title.
Hull's Campbell, 28, a gold medallist at the London Olympics in 2012, survived an early knock-down against the former world champion to win by a comprehensive unanimous decision.
Earlier, Huddersfield's Tyrone Nurse, 26, retained his British super lightweight title with a narrow win over Tommy Coyle, who was unable to become Hull's first British champion after losing to a unanimous decision.
Birmingham's Gamal Yafai, 24, beat Yorkshireman Josh Wale over 12 rounds to retain his Commonwealth super-bantamweight title.
