Cranes coach Milutin 'Micho' Sredojevic has kept faith with the striker, who has not scored for club or country for almost eight months.
Goalkeeper Benjamin Ochan and Muzamil Mutyaba did not make the cut.
But Timothy Dennis Awany and Muhammed Shaban were included for their hard work and fighting spirit.
Uganda will be making a return to the finals after 39 years and will be based in Port-Gentil alongside Ghana, Mali and Egypt.
"We shall continue working hard and fine tuning the team ahead of the tournament," Sredojevic told BBC.
