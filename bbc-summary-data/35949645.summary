An amateur British sailor who died after being swept into the Pacific Ocean while competing in a yacht race will be buried at sea, organisers say.

Sarah Young, 40, was washed overboard while taking part in the Clipper Round the World Yacht Race. Her body was later recovered by her crewmates.
Race organisers said they had received permission from Miss Young's partner and family to bury her at sea.
Race founder Sir Robin Knox-Johnston has promised a full investigation.
He said everyone involved in the race was in "shock" over the death, adding the probe would focus on why she was not tethered to the yacht.
Miss Young is the the second person to die in this year's event - fellow Briton Andrew Ashman, a crew member on the same boat, died after being knocked unconscious in September.
Despite being amateurs, both Miss Young and Mr Ashman were experienced sailors.
Race organisers said Miss Young would be buried at sea because of the "long time it will take to reach closest landfall", and it would take place as soon as weather conditions allowed.
Miss Young's parents are deceased and she has no siblings, but her aunt in New Zealand gave the ceremony her blessing.
Organisers said there was a sombre mood with sailors reflecting on the "tragedy" as the race continued following the death.

Miss Young was tidying the cockpit of the IchorCoal yacht after reefing the mainsail when she was knocked from her position by a wave. She fell back towards the guard wire and was swept under it by another wave.
After she was recovered by crew, attempts were made to resuscitate her but she did not regain consciousness. She died at about 13:44 BST on Friday.
The cause of her death is yet to be confirmed but is suspected to be drowning or exposure, organisers said.
Sir Robin, who in 1969 became the first person to sail solo and non-stop around the world, told the BBC: "We've only had two fatalities in something like 4,000 people, in 10 races around the world.
"It's a shock to all of us and we want to find out exactly why it happened. Why wasn't she hooked on? This is what I've got to establish."
It was an "appalling coincidence" that two crew members from the same yacht had died, he added.
Sir Robin described Miss Young as experienced as a "very popular member of the crew, a very easy person to like".
He went on: "One of the things we really focus on in Clipper with the four weeks' training is safety.
"That is the primary consideration, the one thing we drum into all crew."
Miss Young, who was from London, was one of the sailors taking part in the entire round-the-world challenge.
The incident happened during the ninth race of the 14-stage event which started in August and covers more than 40,000 nautical miles.
Miss Young had already sailed more than half way round the globe, covering 20,000 nautical miles before setting off from the latest leg of the race on 21 March.
She had pulled out of part of the challenge after the death of her mother, organisers said.
Miss Young was the owner of a personal lifestyle company and prior to the Clipper Race had taken part in other expeditions, including mountaineering in Nepal. She had also run a marathon and was a qualified diving group leader.
Other sailors taking part in the race have reacted to the news, with GREAT Britain skipper Peter Thornton saying: "Extremely sad news about Sarah and we are all quite shocked and suddenly acutely aware of where and what we are in this world.
"I cannot imagine what IchorCoal and her family are going through right now so our thoughts are with all who knew and loved Sarah."
Dan Smith, skipper of Derry-Londonderry-Doire said his team was "devastated" by the "tragic news".
Former teammate Louise Thomas said she was "heartbroken", describing Miss Young as her "boat wife" and "best buddy".
She added: "My thoughts go out to those on board, her friends and family - and having been through this event before I know exactly what they're going through and I wish I was there to support them."
Fellow IchorCoal crew member Elliotte Ashcroft wrote on Facebook that Miss Young was a "witty, ballsy, caring lady".
This latest stage of the race takes crews from Qingdao in China to Seattle in the United States and has 3,242 miles still to go.
The crew will now continue on their journey to Seattle.
Sir Robin said: "I should think they are in shock and will want to take it easy for a bit and I have to say I think if I was in their position I would do the same."
More than 700 crew members are participating in the 2015-16 race, which will end in London on 30 July.
