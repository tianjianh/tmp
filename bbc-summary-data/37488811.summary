[SN]TITLE[SN]
Do the clothes we wear define us?

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
New work by Simon Bray and Tristan Poyser explores the way in which our clothes shape us, that outer shell we use to accentuate or sometimes hide who we are.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The work, entitled Duality, is formed of diptychs, with each person posed in their own clothing and their workwear. The aim is to see how a viewer responds to the uniform and how it shapes their perception of that person - how we prejudge based on a uniform or a certain look and style.
Of course, what we wear also affects us, our approach and how we feel.
What is your response to these pictures?
The images are on show at the No Walls Gallery as part of the Brighton Photo Fringe Festival. I'll be highlighting some other work on show at the festival next week.
