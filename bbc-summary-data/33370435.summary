This will be the first time that the duke has taken on the role of a university chancellor.
The university's vice-chancellor Bob Cryan said the duke had showed a "real commitment" to student projects in digital skills and entrepreneurship and had become a "regular visitor".
"This is much more than a ceremonial appointment," said Prof Cryan.
The Duke of York will be formally installed later this month, when actor Sir Patrick Stewart steps down.
The relationship between Prince Andrew and the university goes back to 2001, said a university spokesman.
It began with a charity project and then developed into support for the university's entrepreneurship schemes, with the duke formally becoming the university's patron in 2013.
The university says the duke has also met alumni in Vietnam and Indonesia.
"When he visits us and talks to students who are launching businesses, his grasp of detail and his ability to get to the heart of an issue are always highly impressive," said Prof Cryan.
"Also, he has consistently taken an interest in the University of Huddersfield and the progress that we are making."
