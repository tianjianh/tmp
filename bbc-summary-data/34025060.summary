Azeez headed in Lyle Taylor's cross to move the Dons above City in League Two on goal difference.
George Francomb gave the home side a first-half lead as he hooked in a cross after Andy Barcham's flick-on.
Ryan Harley equalised soon after and City thought they had taken the lead through an own goal, but it was chalked off for a push by Troy Brown.
AFC Wimbledon manager Neal Ardley told BBC London 94.9:

"A win is a win, and any win is a good win, but we weren't at our best today.
"We started brightly for 20 minutes, lost our way a bit and Exeter are the sort of team that can pick holes in you when you're a little bit stretched.
"They grew into the game and we were our own worst enemies at that point.
"We wanted to up the tempo in the second half and we didn't really."
