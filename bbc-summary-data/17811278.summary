[SN]TITLE[SN]
Oxford submits bid to become World Book Capital

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Oxford is submitting its bid to become Unesco World Book Capital City in 2014.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The designation is given to cities to promote reading and literature. Oxford is aiming to become the first English-speaking location to hold the title.
If successful, a programme of events would be staged, including conferences, festivals, plays and writing competitions.
Bid director Kathelene Weiss said the events planned would "promote a love of reading" in the city.
Oxford's bid coincides with the redesign of the Bodleian Weston Library as well as the completion of the Story Museum of children's literature and storytelling.
The Bodleian Library's Mike Heeney said: "It is the opportunity to energise everyone - publishers, booksellers, readers authors and libraries.  It's a great catalyst."
The name of the 2014 winning city is due to be announced by Unesco in June.
