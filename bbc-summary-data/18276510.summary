Det Sgt Trevor Gray, 47, of Watnall, near Nottingham, was found guilty of attacking the 43-year-old in July 2011 while off duty.
The jury took two hours to return its guilty verdict at Derby Crown Court on Wednesday.
Gray, who had denied charges of rape, attempted rape and sexual assault, was jailed for eight years.
The court heard Gray had attacked the woman after the pair had been out for drinks in Nottingham city centre the same night after meeting through mutual friends.
The detective forced the security chain on the front door of the victim's house, made his way upstairs and attacked her as she slept while her child was asleep in a nearby room.
He had claimed the sex was consensual.
Judge John Wait said: "These are grave offences. You forced an entry into a home where your victim and her child were entitled to feel safe.
"You took advantage of her intoxication to rape her. She felt - and was - violated in her own home."
Gray was jailed for eight years for rape, six years for attempted rape and four for sexual assault, to run concurrently.
Det Ch Insp Mick Windmill-Jones, from Nottinghamshire Police's professional standards directorate, said: "We expect our officers and staff to act with the very highest standards of behaviour, integrity and professionalism - on or off duty.
"When they fail to display these qualities and commit a criminal offence, they can expect, like any other member of society, to be arrested, charged and prosecuted in a court of law.
"In this case Trevor Gray's actions go against everything the role of a police officer stands for, which is ultimately to protect innocent people and keep them safe."
