It will take the reigns from Castle Stewart, which has hosted three of the last championships.
Last year's event in Gullane was won by American Rickie Fowler, with Scot Marc Warren tied for fourth.
"The facilities are excellent already, but they've got a lot of plans to improve them," said Warren.
"I think it will be a really good test of golf. It's got everything.
"I would say it's one of the next new links courses in Scotland."

Compatriot and Ryder Cup player Stephen Gallagher said he is confident it will be a "fantastic event" and has backed the idea of rotating the event to different courses.
"It's a perfect fit for the Scottish Open," said Gallagher.
"They're taking it to the best courses. I think it's a great idea to showcase the talent around the country. It's a worthy golf course."
