[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Up to 40 people have been robbed at gunpoint during a church service in Dublin.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The robbery happened at the Compassion Centre in Ballymun - a Christian outreach centre -  at about noon on Sunday.
The congregation was forced to lie on the ground after being threatened with a sawn-off shotgun.
The robber ordered them to empty their pockets, hand over bags, purses and mobile phones.
He then fled in a stolen Fiat Panda.
There were a number of small children among the congregation.
Senior pastor John Eniola said it had been a "frightening" experience.
"He came in through the back door. He had a balaclava covering his face.
"He came in with a gun, a shotgun, and was shouting: 'Everybody to the ground, bring out your money, your wallets and your phones.'
"He said: 'I'm not joking, if any of you move I will shoot.' Thankfully nobody was hurt. There was no fire.
"For a moment it was frightening because this man was carrying a gun.
"We have never seen anything like that before but we pray for him, we forgive him and we would like to see him in church."
Mr Eniola said: "We knew it was a robbery because he was threatening and just asking for wallets and money. If it had been a terror attack it would have been different.
"We suspect it was a man looking for money to buy drugs."
The Compassion Centre is involved in evangelism and set up its Ballymun outreach centre about a year ago to provide help for the homeless and those with addiction problems.
Irish police have appealed for information.
