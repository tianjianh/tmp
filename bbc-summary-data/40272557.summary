It runs until Sunday with over 100 events in the setting of the town's Harmony Gardens.
Anne Reid, star of Dinner Ladies and Last Tango in Halifax, will open proceedings with her one-woman show.
Others scheduled to appear during the festival include John Cleese, Michael Parkinson, Joanna Trollope, Judy Murray and Steve Backshall.
The winner of this year's prestigious Â£25,000 Walter Scott Prize for Historical Fiction will also be announced at the event on Saturday.
Alistair Moffat, festival director, said: "In a climate of political turmoil and unease, we could all do with a dose of fun and entertainment, and the Baillie Gifford Borders Book Festival has it in spades.
"There are serious moments of reflection and contemplation too, as we examine our rapidly changing world.
"This year the book festival has something for everyone and we look forward to welcoming our audience to Harmony Gardens to enjoy a truly memorable weekend."
