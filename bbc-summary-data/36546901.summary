A Bronx Tale, which began its life as a one-man stage play before being filmed, will run at the Longacre Theatre in New York from 3 November.
The show was first staged at the Paper Mill Playhouse in New Jersey last year.
De Niro, 72, said he was "very excited" to "bring this special story to new audiences".
"A Bronx Tale has always had a very special meaning to me and I always thought it had great potential to be a musical," he said.
Co-directed by Jerry Zaks, the show tells of an Italian-American teenager who finds himself torn between the contrasting examples set by his father and a mob-boss father figure.
Zaks, whose Broadway credits include Guys and Dolls and La Cage aux Folles, previously directed Chazz Palminteri's one-man show when it ran on Broadway in 2007.
De Niro, who played the "good" father role in the 1993 film, described Zaks as "a great person" from whom he had "already learned a lot".
The musical features a score by Aladdin composer Alan Menken and Glenn Slater, who previously worked together on Disney's Tangled and the stage version of The Little Mermaid.
A Bronx Tale is one of two films De Niro has directed to date, the other being 2006 espionage drama The Good Shepherd.
