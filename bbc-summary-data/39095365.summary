A number of tyres were set against the rear of Altnaveigh Orange Hall on Martins Lane and set alight causing damage to the eaves of the hall and smoke damage inside.
It was reported to police at about 19:15 GMT on Saturday.
The PSNI said it is working to establish a motive and appealed for anyone with information to contact them.
It is not the first time that Altnaveigh Orange Hall, which dates back to 1884, has been attacked.
In 2008, a memorial plaque to murdered Orangemen was damaged when intruders smashed windows and forced their way into the hall.
The building is currently boarded up and the exterior is covered in paint and graffiti.
An Orange Order spokesman told BBC Radio Ulster the hall is "still utilised but in disrepair due to constant attacks through the years".
