The 27-year-old centre-back started his career at Macclesfield, but also played for Peterborough and had several loan spells before joining Carlisle.
Brisley's loan stint at Leyton Orient in the 2015-16 season saw him play under current Notts boss Kevin Nolan.
"He's a great lad on and off the field. He's a leader," Nolan said.
"I loved working with him at Orient and I still think we can bring out a lot more in him. He's a fantastic addition to what is already a very strong squad."
