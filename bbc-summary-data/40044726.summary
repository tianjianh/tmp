Monday's attack at the Arena killed 22 people, including Martyn Hett a superfan of the soap, and injured 64.
ITV said an inscription would honour the 29-year-old, who had a tattoo of former character Deirdre Barlow, and all the victims.
The bench will be revealed in an extension to the set in Trafford in the coming weeks.
An inscription will read: "For Martyn and all those who lost their lives on 22nd May 2017. We Stand Together", according to a post on the show's website.
Mr Hett, from Stockport, has received a number of high profile tributes, including from popstar Mariah Carey.
Jennie McAlpine, who plays Fiz Brown in Coronation Street, which is set in Weatherfield, a fictional area of Greater Manchester, described him as a "beautiful soul".
She told BBC 5 Live: "He was an extremely fun-loving, unique person."
She said the cast "wanted to send all our love to his family and the families of all the people that have died and that are in hospital".
Mariah Carey, of whom Mr Hett was a fan, posted a picture of Mr Hett on Instagram, saying: "We will cherish your memory forever."
He was at the Ariana Grande gig with a friend when they became separated.
His brother Dan said on Twitter on Wednesday: "They found my brother last night. We are heartbroken."
His family said Mr Hett was "the icon of all our lives".
"Whilst they have taken the life out of Martyn, no-one can, and ever will, take Martyn out of our lives," they said.
His partner Russell Hayward said on Twitter: "He left this world exactly how he lived, centre of attention."
