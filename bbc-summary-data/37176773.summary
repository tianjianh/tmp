Fishguard and Goodwick residents - including firemen, rugby players, local businesses and school children - have created the 'Coast Lines' exhibition.
Some 2,000 drawings are being displayed in sheds around the area, along with in St Mary's Church and on the seafront.
Subjects range from household objects to sketches of the coastline.
Organiser Elizabeth Stonhold - a local artist - came up with the idea for the project 10 months ago and since then, locals have been attending a number of drawing workshops.
It is hoped that the exhibition will invite people to start sketching what they see, rather than take a photo.
"It's been quite a challenge - everyone's sort of nervous to put a pen to paper," said Ms Stonhold.
"People often talk negatively of small towns and these projects are great to share appreciation for the place. It's the idea that 'If the grass is always greener, try watering your own'."
The artwork will be collected at the end of the exhibition and archived through the Peoples Collection of Wales as a piece of Welsh heritage.
A large sketch with multiple contributors that Ms Stonhold calls a "visual sentence" is "likely to go into the Senedd".
The showcase -  which has won the international Big Draw Founders Award - will run until 10 September.
The Big Draw Founders award celebrates community drawing projects.
