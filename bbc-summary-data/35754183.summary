[SN]TITLE[SN]
One of four Raigmore wards affected by bug remains closed

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A single ward at Raigmore Hospital in Inverness now remains closed because of an outbreak of norovirus.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Ward 2A has been out of bounds to new admissions and to visitors since the end of last month after patients fell ill to the vomiting bug.
Another ward that was closed at the end of February, 7C, has been reopened following a deep clean.
Wards 6C and 2C were shut at the weekend because of the virus but were opened again on Monday.
NHS Highland said norovirus remained to be present in the wider community and urged people to heed advice on how to help control it spread.
