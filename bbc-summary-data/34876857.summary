In the tweets Mr Musk appealed for "hardcore software engineers" to work on the firm's Autopilot software.
Mr Musk says he will be interviewing candidates personally.
Separately, Tesla announced a recall of all 90,000 Model S cars sold globally after a report of a faulty seatbelt.
Shares in the company fell 2.6% on the Nasdaq index following the announcement.
Successful engineering candidates will report directly to Mr Musk as the project is "super high priority".
Coders need not have prior experience with cars, he tweeted.
The Autopilot software is designed to let the Model S and Model X Tesla cars automatically steer, change lanes, and adjust speed in response to traffic.
"Ramping up the Autopilot software team at Tesla to achieve generalised full autonomy," he said.
Unlike Google, which wants fully-autonomous vehicles, Tesla wants to introduce features which take away the need for drivers to perform certain actions.
The firm's Autopilot software uses a combination of cameras, radar, sensors and mapping data to found out where it is and navigate.
When the car arrives at its destination, it can scan for a space and park itself.
Car makers including BMW and Volvo are also developing autonomous features for their cars.
