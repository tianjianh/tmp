Bournemouth defender Adam Smith has signed a new four-year deal with the Premier League side.

Smith, 25, joined the club permanently from Tottenham in January 2014, having previously spent time with the Cherries on loan during the 2010-11 season.
The full-back made 36 appearances for Bournemouth in all competitions in the 2015-16 season.
"I get along with all of the lads and the gaffer knows me really well, so it was a no-brainer really," said Smith.
"I think it's important that the club can keep everyone together, as well. We have a great team spirit here and if we can keep everyone then I am sure we can achieve great things together."
Smith's new deal, which runs until 2020, comes a day after fellow defender Steve Cook also committed his future to the club.
