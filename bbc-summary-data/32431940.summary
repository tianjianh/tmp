[SN]TITLE[SN]
Ex-Coventry University lecturer and student admit child pornography offences

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A former university lecturer and student have pleaded guilty to child pornography charges.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Lecturer Martyn Lee, 54, of Meriden, was arrested at Coventry University in February 2014.
He admitted six counts of making and distributing indecent images of children.
Sophie Nightingale, 23, from Stafford, pleaded guilty to four charges of possessing and distributing indecent images of children.
They included one count of possessing extreme pornographic images.
The pair are due to be sentenced at Warwick Crown Court next month.
Coventry University said Lee had been dismissed following a disciplinary hearing in 2014, while performing arts student Nightingale was no longer at the university.
In a statement, it confirmed a university computer used by Lee was seized in connection with the investigation.
It said the couple's relationship and the offences they admitted "took place in their private lives and, in both cases, were outside the University's knowledge and jurisdiction".
"When the University was made aware, swift and appropriate disciplinary action was taken in line with our staff and student codes of conduct," it said.
