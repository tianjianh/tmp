Essex Police named the men as Francis Simmonds, 46, from Luton, and Robert Bull, 40, from Hornchurch.
The pilots were killed when their Beechcraft King Air 200 came down in a field near Chigwell on Saturday.
Mr Simmonds' family said he was a "devoted husband and dad", while Mr Bull was described by his family as a "very happy, fun-loving man".
The plane was owned and operated by London Executive Aviation (LEA), which said it had just taken off from nearby Stapleford Airfield and was heading for Brize Norton in Oxfordshire when it crashed just before 10:20 BST.
Mr Bull, who was the captain of the eight-seater aircraft, had been a pilot since 2003, a job "he had always wanted to do", his family said.
"Rob would always go out of his way to help people and nothing was too much trouble for him.
"He was the glue that held everyone together and his family and friends are devastated by our loss," they said.
The family of Mr Simmonds, the plane's first officer, also said becoming a pilot had been his boyhood dream.
"He loved every day of his job. His death leaves a gaping hole in our hearts and lives," they added.
Essex Police said its officers were continuing to assist investigators from the Air Accidents Investigation Board.
