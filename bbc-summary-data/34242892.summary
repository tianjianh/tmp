The Arriva Cross Country service broke down when its electrics failed between Dawlish and Teignmouth at about 21:30 BST on Sunday.
The same stretch of track was destroyed by winter storms last year and was out of action for several months.
Torrential rain on Sunday night has also left a number homes flooded in Dawlish.
First Great Western said its staff were called to help passengers on the Arriva Cross Country train.
"While the majority of First Great Western services were able to continue running, there were delays to some trains while the Cross Country service was recovered," it said in a statement.
A spokesman for Cross Country said the train involved was the 17:07 service from Manchester to Plymouth.
"When passing Dawlish seafront the train was struck by spray from a wave and seawater entered the train roof causing mechanical problems," he said.
"Despite numerous attempts it proved impossible to get the train restarted so ultimately everyone was transferred to another train to continue their journeys, although involving a considerable delay.
"There were 36 passengers and three train crew onboard."
Four houses in Brunswick Place, Dawlish, were devastated by about 12in (30cm) of water late on Sunday night. Firefighters helped pump water from the properties.
Fire crews were also called to Tongue End in Okehampton where drains overwhelmed by rain caused flooding in a house.
