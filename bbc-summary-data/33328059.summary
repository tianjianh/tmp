Ipswich: Mystery over century-old terracotta bust found on tombstone

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Officials have been left baffled by the arrival of a bust that appeared on a tombstone in a churchyard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The terracotta bust, said to be over a century old, was found at St Lawrence's Church, Ipswich, by a shopkeeper.
Gail Broom, senior conservation officer at Ipswich Borough Council said: "We believe this is around 100 years old.
"We don't know, and are puzzled as to how it arrived on a tombstone in St Lawrence's churchyard. Someone must know who it is and who it belongs to."
She explained the head bears a resemblance to a sculpture of someone from the Commonwealth era of English history.
She said the bust had been found by a shopkeeper, who took it to the Tourist Information Centre in St Stephen's Churchyard.
