[SN]TITLE[SN]
Double rapist Sean Moynihan given lifelong restriction

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A double rapist who once slashed serial killer Peter Tobin in prison has been jailed for a minimum of nine years and given a lifelong restriction order.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Sean Moynihan was convicted of raping an 18-year-old woman at knifepoint on a cycle path in Johnstone, Renfrewshire, on 2 October 2014.
The 31-year-old carried out the attack after being released from a 2009 jail term for raping a 16-year-old girl.
The lifelong restriction order means he may spend the rest of his life in jail.
Jailing Moynihan for the cycle path rape at the High Court in Glasgow, judge Bill Dunlop QC told him that a risk assessment of the danger he presented to public safety was "most alarming and disturbing".
The judge went on: "You are what you are because you want to be. You can change, but if you do not, you face spending the rest of your days behind bars."
The judge said Moynihan would not automatically be freed after the nine year sentence.
He concluded: "You may well never be released."
The court heard that Moynihan was armed with a "rape kit" - including a knife and condoms - when he targeted the young woman.
The victim was walking on the cycle track and thought Moynihan was stopping for a rest while out jogging.
He disappeared from view before grabbing her from behind, forcing her from the path and raping her at knifepoint.
The victim told the trial: "I was crying as I started taking my clothes off. I was saying: 'why are you doing this?'
"He said: 'Don't ask silly questions or I will stab you.'"
The victim eventually escaped when he allowed her to leave.
Moynihan later told police he had met the woman weeks earlier outside a local supermarket and the sex had been consensual.
He named the teenager and insisted she had casually chatted about her mum's job, an ex-boyfriend and how she got on with her family.
But prosecutors said they believed Moynihan had trawled the victim's Facebook page shortly after the rape for information in a bid to "cover-up" his crime.
After Moynihan was sentenced, Det Ch Insp Fil Capaldi, from Police Scotland's public protection unit, said: "This was a complex and protracted investigation for the team.
"Moynihan's sinister web of lies and deceit were unravelled as he tried in vain to cover up what he had done.
"Any decent person will be rightly horrified at the details of this case and thankfully such crimes are extremely rare. Moynihan's sentence today reflects the gravity of his crime."
Moynihan raped the teenager last year after being released from a 2009 jail term for raping a 16-year-old girl, who thought his car was a taxi.
He drove her to Gleniffer Braes in Paisley before forcing the teenager to have sex.
While awaiting sentence for the latest rape, he slashed serial killer Peter Tobin in prison and was jailed to 32 months.
