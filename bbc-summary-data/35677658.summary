Mark Kelbie, 35, from Edinburgh, was driving a silver BMW when the accident happened on the A915 between Upper Largo and Largoward at about 05:00 on Saturday.
It is thought that his car may have struck a wall before leaving the road.
Mr Kelbie was taken to Victoria Hospital in Kirkcaldy, where he later died.
In a statement issued through Police Scotland, his family said: "Mark was a loving son, father and husband who will be sadly missed by all who knew and loved him.
"The family are requesting privacy at this difficult time."
A 24-year-old passenger was also seriously injured in the accident and taken to hospital. His injuries were not thought to be life-threatening.
The road was closed from Upper Largo to Largoward for several hours while officers conducted investigations at the scene.
Sgt Jim Henry, of Police Scotland, said: "Our condolences go to Mark's family and friends and we're working to establish the full circumstances surrounding this collision.
"We're asking anyone who believes they may have seen a silver BMW in the area around this time, or anyone with information which can assist with our inquiries, to come forward."
