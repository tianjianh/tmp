Tour de France 2017: Chris Froome extends lead, Primoz Roglic wins stage

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Britain's Chris Froome extended his lead in the Tour de France to 27 seconds at the end of a brilliant stage 17 won by Slovenia's Primoz Roglic.

Froome was third in a thrilling mountain stage during which Fabio Aru slipped from second to fourth overall.
Marcel Kittel, who led the green jersey contest, was forced to retire from the race after crashing early in the stage.
There are four stages remaining, with a potentially crucial summit finish in Izoard on Thursday.
Froome had lost time on the drag up to the mountain-top finish in Peyragudes on stage 12, and had the yellow jersey taken off him by Aru.
But the Team Sky leader, aiming for his fourth Tour victory and third in succession, reclaimed it on an uphill sprint to Rodez on stage 14.
Should any of his rivals want to ride into Paris on Sunday in the yellow jersey, they need to attack on the punishing slopes up to Izoard and hope Froome cracks, because he is expected to take time off them during Saturday's time trial in Marseille.
In-form Colombian Rigoberto Uran and French favourite Romain Bardet are second and third in the standings - both 27 seconds behind the leader.
Just 29 seconds separated the top four in the general classification as the riders rolled out of La Mure for the 183km stage that comprised two hors categorie climbs up Croix de Fer and the Galibier, plus the category one Telegraphe.
It was a potentially dangerous day for Froome, but after numerous breakaways and attacks it was the 32-year-old who led a group of five riders in pursuit of Roglic.
The Slovenian - a former junior world ski jumping champion - had launched off the front of the remnants of a breakaway and powered over the Galibier, at 2,642m the highest point of this year's race and the final climb of the stage.
He then showed great skill and nerve during the long downhill drag to Serre-Chevalier to maintain his 90-second lead.
Behind him, the group led by Froome - which included fellow GC contenders Bardet and Uran - distanced some of their rivals.
The isolated Aru was the biggest casualty, but Ireland's Dan Martin and Britain's Simon Yates also lost time, although the latter remains in the white jersey as the race's best young rider.
There was drama early in Wednesday's stage when German sprinter Kittel, the winner of five stages this year, abandoned after struggling to the top of the Croix de Fer.
Kittel, who has won 14 Tour stages overall, had struggled on Tuesday as Sunweb's Michael Matthews closed the gap in the green jersey competition.
When Matthews won the intermediate sprint early in Wednesday's stage, a lead that at one time had been in triple figures was now down to just nine points.
By that stage Kittel was already well off the pace again, a crash after 20km leaving him cut and bruised.
But it was nonetheless something of a surprise when he abandoned, in the process handing Australian Matthews a virtually unassailable advantage over German Andre Greipel.
British sprinter Dan McLay, who was last in the overall classification, later joined the list of abandonments, while Frenchman Thibaut Pinot also failed to finish.
Greg LeMond - a three-time winner of the Tour - predicted on Eurosport before Wednesday's stage that it would be Thursday's climb up to Izoard, and not the slog over the Galibier, that could have a serious impact on the battle for the yellow jersey.
"It will come down to Izoard, it will be the first big battle for climbers to win the Tour," said the American.
Thursday's stage does indeed have a steep summit finish at the top of the Izoard - 14.1km at an average gradient of 7.3% - and could make for thrilling viewing.
Before the men's stage, though, there is a women's race - La Course by Le Tour, that runs 67.5km from Briancon to Izoard.
