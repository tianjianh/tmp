Richard Chiassaro, 34, tipped for a podium place at the Games, had the steering wrenched off and carbon wheels buckled at Mark Hall Centre in Harlow.
Police said the incident could have been a targeted attack as no other equipment was damaged.
Mr Chiassaro competes in the 100m and 200m sprint events.

The incident took place between 18:00 GMT on 1 December and midday on Sunday.
"I recently got back from the World Championships in Doha so I know I've got what it takes," he said.
"If I don't get selected for Rio my Olympic dream won't be over, but I will be gutted.
"My chair was perfectly fitted, adjusted and moulded to suit my body shape and for optimal performance.
"I can't get a new chair made until March due to the extremely long waiting list and demand for racing chairs.
"My only hope is to get a second hand chair and just try to make do until a new chair can be made."
He said the vandalism would disrupt his training schedule ahead of the Rio Games.
Mr Chiassaro is funded by British Athletics on the World Class Performance Programme, his girlfriend Claire Broadbent said.
"This means he does receive some funding, but not enough to buy a new race chair - it allows him to eat the correct food for his performance and training expenses," she said.
Police investigating the attack have appealed for information.
