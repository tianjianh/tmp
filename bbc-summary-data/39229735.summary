The 20-year-old made his Warriors debut in the win against Leigh and his start at Wolves was just his second outing.
He scored 20 tries in 22 games on loan at Championship side Swinton in 2016 on a dual registration deal, while also working as a trainee accountant.
"I'm really, really pleased for Liam," Wane told BBC Radio 5 live.
"His effort in training has been fantastic. With the pre-season he's had, he earned the right to play.
"I thought they were four quality tries and quality finishes.
"It is a shot in the arm for our youth system as it shows to everybody that a first-team start is never that far away. You just take your chances when they come and he's taken his."
Wane also confirmed that England forward John Bateman is expected to be out for three months with a shoulder injury.
