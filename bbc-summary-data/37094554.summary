Portadown appeal hearing over suspension is postponed

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Portadown's appeal hearing into their suspension from all football related activity has been postponed.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Tuesday night's hearing, on the club's failure to pay disciplinary fees for undisclosed payments to players, is off as Ports officials are not available.
A new date for the hearing has yet to be arranged by the Irish FA.
The suspension was temporarily lifted after the IFA said the club had grounds for an appeal and a final decision will be made following the hearing.
A Â£5,000 fine was imposed, along with a transfer embargo preventing the club from signing players on professional terms until June 2017, after irregularities were found in payments made to former striker Gary Twigg.
It is understood that an initial cheque sent by Portadown to the IFA 'bounced'.
The fine was later paid but the IFA's Disciplinary Committee decided to keep the the ban in place, although subsequently it was lifted until the appeal hearing.
Portadown's opening league game against Coleraine was postponed as a result of the controversy.
Another appeal by the club, against a 12-point deduction imposed after they were found to have paid Peter McMahon while he was registered as an amateur, will also be heard by the IFA's Appeals Committee at the same meeting.
