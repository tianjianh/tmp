At Bristol Crown Court last month Marcin Koscielniak, 28, of Westlea, Swindon, was found guilty of the manslaughter of the father of three.
The victim, Polish national Grzegorz Beyer, had recently moved to Swindon to start a new life, and was described by loved ones as a "wonderful family man".
Mr Beyer, 40, was attacked in the town on 2 May and died two days later.
Det Ch Insp Jeremy Carter, of the Brunel Major Crime Investigation Team, said the victim was out with friends when they were approached by another group of Polish nationals.
He said: "Koscielniak, who was part of this group, punched Grzegorz which, tragically, proved fatal.
"Although Koscielniak may not have intended to kill Grzegorz that night, it is clear that he died as a result of his actions.
"I am pleased with the conviction and I hope that it is of some comfort for Grzegorz's family and friends."
He added Wiltshire Police would be re-launching its "One Punch Can Kill" campaign to highlight how even a single punch could end with serious consequences.
"It is clear many still don't understand the impact of just one solitary punch and this should never be underestimated.
"Many lives can be ruined in a split second," said Mr Carter.
