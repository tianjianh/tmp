Other charges of driving without a licence and insurance will lie on file, the court was told.
After sentencing Det Insp Scott Egerton speaking said: "They (Reigan Knight and Liam Phillips) were passengers in the car and had no control over the events that led to their tragic deaths.
"The driver of this car has pleaded guilty; he drove dangerously without a licence or insurance in a car he had bought and he caused their deaths.
"He has to live with this for the rest of his life, but so do the families of Reigan and Liam."
In the wake of the deaths about 300 people attended a candlelit beach vigil for the two boys.
