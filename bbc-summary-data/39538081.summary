Police said the child was struck by a red Renault Master van on Brechan Rig in Elgin at about 17:30 on Friday.
The van was being driven by a 46-year-old man who was uninjured in the incident. The identity of the child has yet to be released.
Police have appealed for witnesses to the crash or anyone who saw the van in the time before the accident to come forward.
Sgt Steve Manson said, "My thoughts, and that of my officers, are very much with the family and friends of the seven-year-old boy who sadly died in this tragic collision.
"I would appeal to anyone who may have seen the crash or who may have seen the red Renault Master van shortly beforehand and who hasn't yet spoken with police to do so as a matter of urgency to help us piece together exactly what happened."
