The jury heard it was not "medically plausible" that Kevin Williams regained consciousness and said "mum" before he died.
Danny Gordon is the brother of Kevin's mother Anne Williams, who campaigned for more than 20 years for a new inquest into her son's death, but died before the current hearings began.
Mr Gordon said: "It has been a long, long time waiting and when it comes it is hard."
Kevin was one of 96 people who died following a crush at the FA Cup semi-final between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest on 15 April 1989.
