Chris Froome: Sir Bradley Wiggins says data will not change things

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Sir Bradley Wiggins says Chris Froome releasing his independent physiological testing results will not change anything, including what people think.

Froome's data is due to be published by Esquire magazine on Friday and submitted to a scientific journal.
The two-time Tour de France winner chose to share it to prove that people can "trust" his achievements.
"It's what people have called for and Chris and has done it, so hats off to him," Wiggins told BBC Radio 5 live.
"I'm sure it is not something for them to live and die by, or if it will change anything. It is a small step maybe."
Froome was spat at by some spectators during this year's Tour following media claims of doping.
But Wiggins, who was a team-mate of Froome at Team Sky before leaving earlier this year, has sympathy for what the 30-year-old had to put up with on his way to winning his second yellow jersey.
"I think to be under that amount of scrutiny for three weeks and do what he did was admirable. It shows his physical and mental strength to be able to deal with that," said Wiggins.
"Being spat at - sport is hard enough as it is without facing what he had to face."
