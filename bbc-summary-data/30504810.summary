Youngsters in Northumberland are being taught how to take a safe "selfie".

Northumberland County Council's youth service started the project amid fears young people were making themselves vulnerable online.
Youth workers are working with youngsters at clubs across the county.
Advice includes not showing school uniform logos or street names in pictures, adjusting privacy settings and switching off the phone's GPS so locations cannot be tracked.
Labour councillor Robert Arckless, policy board member for children's services, said: "Many young people do not understand that the images they are taking are unsafe and that, once posted, they could be available forever.
"We are running the campaign to help prevent young people from putting themselves in a vulnerable position and opening themselves up to exploitation and bullying."
