[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Police said they were called to the "sudden death" of the Bournemouth University student, aged in her 30s, at a house in Gillet Road. Officers discovered "unknown chemical substances" at the property.
Neighbours left their homes while the substances were removed on Thursday.
The death is not being treated as suspicious and next of kin are aware.
The university described the death in the student village on the edge of its Talbot Campus as "an isolated incident" and said it was "making support available for any student who has been affected".
Dorset and Wiltshire Fire and Rescue Service also attended the scene.
