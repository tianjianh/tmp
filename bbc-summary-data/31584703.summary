Scrum-half Kessell, 24, arrives on a short-term deal, having agreed to join Northampton Saints in the summer.
He will be immediately loaned back to Cornish Pirates, along with prop Ford-Robinson, but both will be available for Bristol's play-off campaign.
Bristol boss Andy Robinson confirmed the two clubs will come to an agreement over the players' release dates.
"With Luke Baldwin signing for Worcester, we needed cover at nine," Robinson said of Kessell's arrival.
"Once it's guaranteed Cornish Pirates are safe but also not in the play-offs, he'll join us. If things go to plan, we expect to have him in April.
Speaking to BBC Radio Bristol, Robinson added: "Jamal is a very good young prospect. He can play either side but we're looking at him being a tight-head.
"Sometimes there's a shortage of props so he's going to have to stay with the Pirates until they no longer need him. We'll hopefully probably have him for the run-in to the play-offs."
Kessell has spent his entire career with his hometown club and has made 12 starts this term, scoring five tries.
Bristol-born 21-year-old Ford-Robinson started out at Leicester before spells with Cambridge and Cornwall.
He has agreed a deal with Bristol until the end of the 2015-16 season.
