[SN]TITLE[SN]
Wycombe Wanderers 0-1 Mansfield Town

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Krystian Pearce's early goal gave Mansfield a win at Wycombe that keeps their League Two play-off hopes alive and dents the Chairboys' own top seven ambitions.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The win leaves Mansfield just two points behind Carlisle in the final play-off place, while Wycombe are now four points off the pace and down in 13th.
Following a lively start, the deadlock was broken by the visitors in the 13th minute when a free-kick floated in by Joel Byrom was headed against the post by Pearce, who then stole in on his own rebound to nod home from a yard out.
Both sides went close during the remainder of a hard-fought first period, but neither was able to add to the scoreline.
Wycombe were the better side after the break, but could not find a way past Jake Kean.
The Stage goalkeeper produced a superb save from a Joe Jacobson free-kick and an even better one from Adebayo Akinfenwa's close-range header when the big striker looked certain to score to secure all three points for the visitors.
