Oxford United 1-1 Stevenage

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Relegation-threatened Stevenage grabbed a vital draw against 10-man Oxford.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The second-placed U's were reduced to 10 men after just 16 minutes when John Lundstram was shown a straight red for a reckless challenge on Michael Tonge.
Oxford skipper Liam Sercombe then had his second-half penalty saved after Jones manhandled Danny Hylton, but he made amends in the 58th minute with his 14th goal of the season.
But Boro equalised when Byron Harrison fired home from Greg Luer's pass.
Stevenage sit 22nd in the League Two table, seven points above the drop zone.
Lundtsram's red card means the 22-year-old playmaker will now miss Oxford United's Johnstone's Paint Trophy final against Barnsley at Wembley on 3 April.
