Theresa May sacking ministers 'would get MPs' support'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Theresa May would have the backing of Tory MPs if she sacked disloyal ministers for plotting and briefing, a senior backbencher says.

Charles Walker, vice chairman of the backbench 1922 Committee, told ministers to "stop chattering away".
Earlier the PM told her cabinet to show "strength and unity" as she attempted to stem the leaks.
And she told Tory MPs to end the "backbiting" over disagreements within the party on Brexit and other issues.
Number 10 said press briefings were a case of colleagues not taking their responsibilities seriously.
Speaking on BBC Radio 4's The World at One, Mr Walker said that aside from a few "outliers", the party was united behind Mrs May - adding that those plotting were "not doing themselves any favours at all".
"I do not care about people's personal ambitions," he said.
"If the prime minister has to start removing secretaries of state because they are not focusing on their job, they are focusing on their own personal ambitions, so be it. And she will have the support of the 1922 Committee."
Mrs May's attempt to instil discipline follows a sustained outbreak of cabinet leaks and leadership gossip.
According to her spokesman, the PM told cabinet at its regular Tuesday meeting: "There's a need to show strength and unity as a country and that starts around the cabinet table."
On Monday she told Tory MPs to end the "backbiting" over disagreements within the party.
At a summer reception for backbench Tory MPs on the House of Commons terrace on Monday, Mrs May told the party "no backbiting, no carping".
The choice, she said, is "me or Jeremy Corbyn... and nobody wants that".
Go away over the summer for a "proper break", she told MPs, and "come back ready for serious business".
Speaking on BBC Breakfast, Home Secretary Amber Rudd said media reports of splits and negative briefings did not reflect her experience in cabinet.
She said Mrs May was "absolutely right" to tell ministers that "what is said in the cabinet should stay in the cabinet".
The PM's plea to her party for unity comes after she lost her Commons majority when her snap general election gamble backfired.
Hostile briefings in the press over the weekend appeared to show a growing rift in the cabinet.
On Sunday, Chancellor Philip Hammond suggested colleagues opposed to his approach to Brexit had been briefing against him, following press reports of his cabinet remarks on public sector pay.
During Treasury questions in the Commons, Mr Hammond dismissed Lord Heseltine's claim - raised by Labour - that he was "enfeebled".
"I don't feel particularly enfeebled," he said.
