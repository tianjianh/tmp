County Championship: Alastair Cook makes four on Essex return

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
England Test captain Alastair Cook made only four at Grace Road, after Division Two leaders Essex bowled out Leicestershire on day one.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Jamie Porter (4-50) took two wickets in two balls in the first over, trapping both Paul Horton and Neil Dexter lbw.
Angus Robson (52) and Mark Cosgrove (71) put on 129 for the third wicket as Leicestershire were all out for 238.
Dieter Klein (2-7) removed both Cook and nightwatchman Porter as the visitors finished the day on 13-2.
Playing his first game for Essex since their 10-wicket win against Kent in July, Cook went into the game averaging 114.6 with the bat in the Championship.
The visitors began with a 23-point lead over Leicestershire, with only three more games to play this season and just a single promotion place available.
