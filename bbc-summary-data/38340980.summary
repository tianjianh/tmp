[SN]TITLE[SN]
Unite members reject Offshore Contractors Association offer

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Members of the Unite union have voted to reject an offer from the Offshore Contractors Association (OCA).

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The union said the proposals would have seen no increase in pay and no change to the conditions of members.
The OCA - the umbrella body for offshore contractors - said it was "extremely disappointed" that members had rejected the deal.
Unite, along with the GMB union, have been seeking a wage increase for offshore members.
Paul Atkinson, chief executive of the OCA, said: "We will continue to maintain close contact with our partner unions Unite and GMB  as we seek to find a way forward together in the best interests of both our member companies and those who work for them."
In July, hundreds of North Sea workers went on strike over plans to cut their pay and allowances.
The action was taken by members of the RMT and Unite unions employed by the Wood Group on Shell platforms.
It was the first industrial action of its kind in the offshore oil and gas industry in almost 30 years.
