Cleveland Police said the 34-year-old man will appear before Teesside Magistrates' Court later.
He has been charged with the murder of Lynne Freeman, 46, and 30-year-old Jodie Betteridge.
A force spokesman said: "A 34-year-old man arrested on suspicion of the murder of two women in Redcar has now been charged with two counts of murder."
Ms Freeman's children Sarah Helm, 28, James Helm, 27, Kimberley Helm, 25 and Lauren Freeman, 18, previously said in a statement: "We shouldn't have to be writing a tribute to our mother who was taken from us so early. She should still be here to watch her four kids and grandkids grow.
"She was thriving in life and loved the volunteer work that she did in her church, and as a street angel for Redcar Beacons, always putting others before herself. She adored every one of her children and loved being a Grandma.
"She wore her heart on her sleeve, always made an effort for people and she really would go the extra mile. She gave so much and never asked for anything in return and we'll always be proud of her.
"You are loved beyond words and an amazing soul never dies, you'll never understand how much you will be missed. Our mother was always the angel looking after others but now the angels are looking after her."
In tribute to Ms Betteridge, Theresa Largan, 51, said: "Jodie lived for her kids. I don't think I ever saw her on her own, she always had the tribe with her. I just want the family to know that we are all thinking of her and them."
