A man has been arrested and is helping South Wales Police officers with their inquiries.
Police said a family liaison officer had been appointed and was supporting the motorcyclist's next of kin. The coroner has been informed.
Officers are appealing for any witnesses to contact them, including anyone who stopped to provide assistance, or anyone who may have seen the motorcycle being driven before the collision with a second motorcycle.
The road was closed for about four hours while police carried out their investigations and recovered the vehicles.
