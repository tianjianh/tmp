[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Lawyers for a pregnant woman from Birmingham arrested in Pakistan after heroin worth Â£3.2m was found said they withdrew their bail application after it appeared judges would refuse it.

Khadija Shah, 25, was taken into custody in May after the drug was found in several suitcases she was carrying.
She denies the charges, saying she had been on holiday in Pakistan and had no idea what was in the cases.
Ms Shah's lawyers said they feared she was not getting proper medical help.
Her lawyer Sarah Belal, from charity Reprieve, said officials at the jail in Adiala, near Islamabad, had sent them a letter saying Ms Shah was well, had been given vitamins and milk and that her pregnancy was progressing well.
However, Ms Belal said they had not provided any evidence for it and she feared for her client's health and that of her unborn child.
Ms Shah, who is due to give birth in a month's time, was originally held in custody with her daughter, aged four, and her five-year-old son.
They have since been released and have been taken back to the UK by their grandmother.
Ms Belal said they would submit another bail application within "a week or two".
It is thought that if Ms Shah is convicted of trying to smuggle the 63kg of heroin, she could face the death penalty.
