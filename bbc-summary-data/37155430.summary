Gareth Willington, 59, from Carew, died after his boat, The Harvester, sank off St David's Head on 28 April. His son Daniel, 32, has never been found despite a large-scale sea search.
About 60 people went to the service on the Rath in Milford Haven on Monday.
Milford Haven town clerk Moira Galliford said: "It was a really nice service for what was a tragic event."
The service was organised by Milford Haven town council, The Mission to Seafarers and led by Father Harri Williams of St Katharine and St Peter's Church.
Mayor of Milford Haven, William Elliott, said: "It was a tragic loss of life of two men who were just doing their job.
"Milford Haven has a huge connection to the fishing industry and it's important that we as a community remember them and the fishermen who risk their lives everyday doing a dangerous job."
