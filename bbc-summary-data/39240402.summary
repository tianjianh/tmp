Raith Rovers 2-1 Dundee United

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Raith Rovers beat Dundee United to consign Ray McKinnon's side to their fifth consecutive league match without a win.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Craig Barr put Rovers ahead just before half-time when he headed in Chris Johnston's free-kick.
Rovers' lead was extended by Ryan Hardie's low, left-footed shot four minutes into the second half.
Simon Murray's neat finish in a crowded penalty box provided hope for the visitors.
But they failed to find the leveller despite a host of attacking substitutions.
John Hughes' side could have scored a third had the base of the post not kept out another Barr header from another Johnston cross.
It is now two wins in their last three games for Rovers under Hughes, whose side move above Dumbarton into seventh place.
United manager McKinnon, who was previously in charge at Stark's Park, will continue to rack his brain for solutions to this slump in form.
Other than an early William Edjenguele miss and a second-half Willo Flood drive, the Tannadice men struggled to create opportunities.
However, they did apply a lot of pressure in the closing stages from set pieces.
