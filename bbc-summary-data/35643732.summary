Richard Burford, 36, died unexpectedly two weeks ago, leaving behind wife Sara, 34, and their three young children.
An online memorial fund has raised £27,028 which Mrs Burford said will be put away for son William, two, twin daughters Lucy and Kate, aged one.
An inquest has been opened.
The cause of death is unknown.
Mrs Burford told BBC Newcastle her husband, a software engineer, had finished work and put their three children to bed before going for a jog.
He collapsed on a driveway near his home in Guisborough.
She said: "When he didn't come home I knew pretty quickly something was wrong, he always came home at a certain time.
"When the police came they just said there was no easy way to tell you this, and that's it.
"He made us a very strong family, he's left me with a lot of love, he's left me with three beautiful children."
Mrs Burford said she was overwhelmed by the generosity of those who have given to the fund, which was set up by her sister-in-law.
She said: "To say thank you simply isn't enough, the gratitude and love I feel in my heart because so many people have come together to help us has given me so much positivity for the future."
