'No repeat' of toilet problem on Ben Macdui

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Conservationists hope a problem with human waste being left on the summit of the UK's second highest mountain has gone away.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
RSPB Scotland and National Trust for Scotland raised concerns in October that the faeces on Ben Macdui posed a potential health risk.
The RSPB said there had been no incidents of irresponsible toileting detected since last year.
The two charities own the 4,295ft (1,309m) mountain.
Ben Macdui, second on the list of the UK's tallest peaks after Ben Nevis, is in the Cairngorms.
Some of the waste was left at the ruins of the stone-built Sapper's Bothy.
A spokesman for RSPB Scotland said: "We believe that the problem may have been something of a 'one-off' and have not received any calls about the problem recently.
"I think we can say that people are, on the whole, respecting the mountain environment and we are grateful for that."
