The Sex and the City star was due to play the lead role in a new play called Linda, by Penelope Skinner.
In a statement, Cattrall said "with great sadness and at the advice of my doctors" she would not be able to continue with the production.
The star, 59, thanked the theatre "for allowing me to put my health first".
Olivier Award winner Noma Dumezweni has stepped in to replace Cattrall, and will join rehearsals on Friday.
Royal Court artistic director, Vicky Featherstone, said the theatre was "deeply sorry that Kim is unable to continue with the production".
"We are extremely grateful and also thrilled that Noma Dumezweni, one of our most brilliant actors, has agreed to take on this challenge at such short notice.
"We are delighted that in spite of these difficulties Penelope Skinner's important play can open to our audiences with minimal disruption."
Performances begin on 26 November, with press night on 1 December.
