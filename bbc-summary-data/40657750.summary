The fire service said it had requested interim safety measures and had carried out re-inspections.
As well as the Leeds tower blocks, three failed in Halifax and one in Bradford.
More stories from across Yorkshire
High-rise cladding combustibility tests have been carried out across the UK in the wake of the Grenfell Tower fire.
The fire service said those which failed in West Yorkshire were a mix of privately-owned buildings and social housing - all six storeys or higher.
The West Yorkshire tower blocks which failed cladding combustibility tests are:
Some of the failed tower blocks have been asked to install temporary fire alarms, move smoking areas and clear rubbish and combustible items.
PPHE Group, which runs Park Plaza, said the hotel "proactively" submitted cladding test samples and "fully complied" with the fire service's interim requirements.
Shaun Broers from Park Plaza said: "At this time no recommendations have been made to remove or update the cladding.
"This will be reviewed if any further guidance or advice is offered from the Department for Communities and Local Government."
A spokesperson for Unite, which manages Concept Place and Sky Plaza student accommodation in Leeds, said: "Based on the advice of experts and bearing in mind the wide range of fire prevention measures we have in place, we believe our buildings are safe for occupation.
"We will do everything necessary to ensure our buildings remain safe."
The fire service said more fire engines would be sent to tower block fires; six (one with high-reach capability) to most tower blocks, and eight (two with high reach capability) to failed blocks.
Residents were also urged to "do their bit" in being vigilant and knowing evacuation procedures.
