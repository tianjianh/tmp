[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Rain has delayed England's first match under new captain Heather Knight against Pakistan in Leicester - which will now be played on Tuesday.

The first one-day international was set to begin at 14:00 BST, but heavy rain delayed the start, with standing water on parts of the outfield.
After inspections at 15:30 and 17:00, the umpires adjudged that no play would be possible on Monday.
A full game will take place on Tuesday's reserve day, at 10:30 BST.
Under ICC Women's Championship rules, a reserve day is in place for each game in the three-match series.
The second match is scheduled to take place at Worcester on Wednesday at 10:30 BST.
