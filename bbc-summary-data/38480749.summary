Derby manager Steve McClaren has said he wants Chris Martin to return early from his season-long loan with Fulham.

It comes after Fulham boss Slavisa Jokanovic dismissed reports that the striker would be released early, saying the club is "not a train station".
Jokanovic said Martin, 28, "made himself unavailable" for Friday's abandoned game at Reading
"If there is any possibility of getting him back, that would be great," McClaren told BBC Radio Derby.
"But that is between the two clubs. They have an agreement so we will have to wait and see. It is for the clubs to sort and for us managers to leave it well alone."
The Scotland international scored 43 goals in less than two seasons during McClaren's first spell in charge of the Rams. And the former England boss admits to being surprised that the player was allowed to leave under pervious boss Nigel Pearson.
"I've made it clear how I like Chris Martin," said McClaren. "If I had my choice when I first came in, he would still be here,"
Martin has scored seven goals in 17 appearances for Fulham in the Championship this term.
