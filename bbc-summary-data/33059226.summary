[SN]TITLE[SN]
Bishop of Crediton named as Rev Dame Sarah Mullally

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A dame and former nurse is to become the new Bishop of Crediton, the Diocese of Exeter has announced.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Rev Dame Sarah Mullally, 53, will become the fourth female bishop in the UK when she is consecrated in Canterbury Cathedral next month.
Dame Sarah is currently the Canon Treasurer at Salisbury Cathedral.
She was made a Dame Commander of the British Empire in 2005 in recognition of her outstanding contribution to nursing and midwifery.
"I am delighted to be appointed as the Bishop of Crediton," she said.
"Throughout my life, as both a nurse and a priest, I have experienced God's enduing love and I hope as Bishop to be able to share that love with others."
She was ordained in 2001 and served her curacy in St Saviour's Battersea Fields and in 2012 became Canon Treasurer at Salisbury Cathedral.
Her appointment is to replace the Rt Rev Nick McKinnel who moved to become Bishop of Plymouth in April.
The Bishop of Exeter, the Rt Rev Robert Atwell, said he was delighted to welcome her to Devon.
"This is an outstanding appointment. Sarah will enrich the life of the church in Devon enormously," he said.
"She will bring to her new role the same mixture of compassion, integrity and professionalism that has characterised everything she has done and achieved, both nationally and specifically within the Church of England."
