Former Baywatch star Jeremy Jackson has been thrown out of Celebrity Big Brother after pulling open another contestant's dressing gown.

The incident began when the actor, 34, got drunk on a mixture of rum and vodka and vomited in the toilet.
He was being comforted by glamour model Chloe Goodman, who suddenly exclaimed: "That's not OK, I'm leaving now", before leaving the bathroom in tears.
Goodman said:  "He went to my dressing gown top and put my boob out."
The incident itself was not broadcast when the Channel 5 show showed the aftermath of the incident in Saturday night's show, as cameras do not film in the toilet.
Jackson at first defended himself, telling the housemates he "didn't know she had nothing on underneath" the robe.
After the incident, which took place on Friday, producers arranged for Jackson to sleep in a separate area.
However, they decided to remove him the following day, calling his behaviour "wholly unacceptable".
Michelle Visage, another of the contestants in the reality show, told him he should "respect a woman's body", adding: "Do not touch a woman in that way."
The actor replied: "I barely touched her, that's not an excuse, I know that."
Later, speaking in the show's diary room, Jackson described the incident as a mixture of "innocence and curiosity", saying he had been "silly, bold and dumb" to lift Goodman's robe as she was offering assistance.
Her actions "seemed like flirtation", he added, before backtracking and saying he was "too emotionally wounded to really even gauge any real relationship-type flirtation".
"I made a mistake and now I'm in boiling water for it," he added.
Speaking before he left, Jackson insisted his action was "not a ripping open or an aggressive move" but added: "I accept all the ramifications".
Jackson, who played the son of David Hasselhoff's character Mitch Buchannon on Baywatch, is well-known for his troubled personal life and fellow housemates had expressed concern about his drinking in the days since the current series of Big Brother launched on Wednesday.
Fellow contestant Perez Hilton, a celebrity blogger, had questioned the wisdom of Jackson participating in the show, saying that the actor was not "mentally stable" and "borderline scary".
Meanwhile, former Coronation Street star Ken Morley was also given a formal warning for using "unacceptable language" after he used the word "negro" to describe R&B singer Alexander O'Neal.
O'Neal responded angrily, telling Morley: "I'm just giving you some information - it's just black, we don't use negro any more."
Saturday's broadcast of Celebrity Big Brother was pushed back by one hour, to 22:00 GMT, in light of the "explosive drama," said Channel Five in a statement.
