Rangers fan Scott Allan would do well at Celtic - Derek Ferguson

Former Rangers midfielder Derek Ferguson reckons being a supporter of the Ibrox club would not stop Scott Allan from succeeding at Celtic.

The Parkhead side have agreed a fee with Hibernian for midfielder Allan, who is a boyhood Rangers fan.
BBC Scotland has learned that Allan would consider joining the Premiership champions.
"He just looks to me a guy that could probably handle that type of situation," said Ferguson.
"He's a class act in my opinion. If he went to Celtic, I think his performance level would go up a notch.  He's got a bit of gallous-ness about him; a swagger.
"What I would say is that if a big club like Celtic comes calling, I think it's a no-brainer. You've got to take that opportunity because getting the opportunity to sign, whether it's a Rangers or Celtic - one of the bigger clubs - you don't knock it back."
Rangers have had three bids for the 23-year-old rejected, with the Edinburgh side adamant they will not do business with a Championship rival. Allan submitted a transfer request following the second of those offers from Ibrox.
Ferguson spent seven years at Rangers between 1983 and 1990 and admitted he could not have made the switch to city rivals Celtic, but recalled the time when one former Celtic player famously joined the Ibrox club.
"In the era I played in, personally, no," he told BBC Radio Scotland's Sportsound programme.
"I think it would take a certain type of character. I was at Rangers when Mo Johnston signed. I thought he was crazy. I think Mo was one of the guys that could handle that situation.
"It was amazing because I remember the times when season tickets and scarves were thrown onto the pitch. The Rangers fans would not turn up and watch Rangers Football Club, but when Mo Johnston started banging in the goals, those empty seats started to fill up.
"It's about what you do on the park at the end of the day."
Someone who has witnessed first-hand what Allan can produce on the pitch is former Hibs captain Liam Craig, who played with the ex-West Brom man at Easter Road during the 2014-15 season.
Craig believes Allan has the "character" to go onto great things at Parkhead if the transfer materialises.
"Could he go and play in Celtic's team? I think he could," he told BBC Radio Scotland
"I think Hibs are right not to do business with Rangers. They know how important Scott is to them and how close it's going to be between them and Rangers this season.
"Probably what Hibs don't want is, come January, when there's six months left on his contract, he goes and signs a pre-contract with Rangers. Then do you play him? Can you trust him?
"So if there is the opportunity there to do business with Celtic and bring in one, maybe two players from them on loan, you're going to strengthen your squad and have a right push for the title this season.
"If Scotty was to go there, it might take him a wee bit time to get in but once he gets in he's definitely got the ability to and the confidence to stay in that team every week."
