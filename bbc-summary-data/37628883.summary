Louise Lucas: Rails 'may not have stopped' Kingsway death

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Installing rails along the central reservation of Swansea's Kingsway may not have prevented the death of a police officer who was hit by a bus, an inquest has heard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Sgt Louise Lucas, 41, died when she stepped into the path of a single decker bus in March 2015.
Civil engineer Mark Thomas told the Swansea inquest on Wednesday the road had designated crossings and markings.
Following Sgt Lucas' death temporary railings were put up.
Acting Coroner Colin Phillips asked whether the risk of pedestrians looking the wrong way while crossing the unconventional layout of Kingsway had been identified during previous audits.
Mr Thomas replied: "Yes."
He said: "A measured approach was taken and a number of considerations were taken on board.
"I consider the fact that we incorporated designated signalling points for pedestrians to be an appropriate response to safety concerns raised in the audit."
Asked whether Sgt Lucas's death would have been prevented had railing along the central reservation already been in place, Mr Thomas replied: "No, sir."
Mr Thomas added there is evidence pedestrians "continue to cross the Kingsway using the central reservation" and not the designated crossing points despite the introduction of guard rails since the incident.
On Tuesday the inquest heard evidence from Sgt Lucas's best friend Karen Williams who said she would not have seen the bus coming.
