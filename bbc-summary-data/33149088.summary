[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A former BMW-Mini worker who siphoned off almost £6m from the car manufacturer has been jailed for five years and four months.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Johannes Franken, 50, from Bromsgrove, Worcestershire, admitted six counts of fraud at a hearing at Oxford Crown Court last month.
He made 59 transactions between the motor manufacturer and himself, between 2011 and 2014.
Some of the cash was spent on buying a diving school in Mauritius.
Other proceeds went on high-end cars, a motorbike, a property in France, watches and jewellery.
Franken, a former account manager at the BMW-Mini plant in Oxford, made it look like he was paying a supplier, but he was actually paying the cash into his own account.
The payments ranged from £7,000 to £278,000, totalling £5.9m. The fraud was discovered following a routine audit by BMW-Mini.
Appearing at Oxford Crown Court via videolink, on 12 May, Franken admitted five counts of fraud and one count of acquiring criminal property.
Speaking after the conviction, Det Sgt Duncan Wynn of Thames Valley Police said: "Franken has systematically abused his position of trust with his employer to steal large sums of money.
"So far assets and monies totalling £2.7m have been located and restrained under the Proceeds of Crime Act. We are currently actively pursuing the outstanding amounts."
