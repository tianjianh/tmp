John Sheridan: Notts County manager knows job is precarious

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Manager John Sheridan says Notts County's poor run means it is inevitable his job is under threat, irrespective of who owns the club.

Ray Trew has agreed to sell the League Two side to businessman Alan Hardy.
Notts are 20th in the table, just one point above the relegation zone having lost 11 of their 21 league matches.
"I am worried about my position because I am not winning games - not because a new owner is coming in," Sheridan, 52, told BBC Nottingham Sport.
The former Chesterfield boss was appointed by Trew at the start of the season but, despite a promising start, they have managed just six league wins and have lost their past six League Two matches.
"I am on the worst run I have ever had as a football manager and expect us to do a lot better," Sheridan added.
"I have had a decent career as a manager and am gutted the way things are at the moment.
"If you are not winning games there will be a problem somewhere. I have to respect that because of the run we are on there is a question mark over me, but I believe in myself and will try to work my socks off and turn it around."
Sheridan also feels bad for not delivering results for the Magpies owner.
"I'm on a bit of a downer because I get on really well with the chairman and his wife Aileen and I am a bit gutted because of the way things are going," Sheridan added.
"I feel I have let them down a little bit with the way we are going, the performances we are showing and the results we are showing. They have put a lot of trust in me.
"It is a shame the way it is at the moment but everyone has to look forward and if it's good for the club then it's the right way to go."
Local businessman Hardy is chief executive of the Paragon group and owner of Nottinghamshire Golf and Country Club.
Trew put the club up for sale in February after claiming his family were subjected to "foul and mindless abuse".
