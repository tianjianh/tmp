Burke, who replaces Beverley Knight in June, said it was "a dream come true" to land the "iconic" part of troubled superstar Rachel Marron.
The film, which co-starred Kevin Costner in the title role, gave Houston one of the biggest-selling singles of all time with I Will Always Love You.
Burke beat JLS to win 2008's X Factor.
"I am a massive Whitney Houston fan so to be given the opportunity to play a role made famous by her every night will be a real privilege," said Burke.
The Bodyguard musical, directed by Thea Sharrock, is set to run at London's Adelphi Theatre until the end of August where it has been since 2012.
Burke added: "I start rehearsals very soon with my fellow cast mates and the brilliant creative team and, with a little trepidation, I am looking forward to our first performance in June."
Burke was mentored to X Factor success by Cheryl Cole and has since released two albums.
Her debut winner's single - a cover of Leonard Cohen's Hallelujah - sold more than a million copies in the UK.
As well as the cover of Dolly Parton's I Will Always Love You, the musical features renditions of several other classic Houston tracks, including So Emotional, One Moment in Time and I Wanna Dance With Somebody.
