NI state papers: Dublin anger over Birmingham Six and John Stalker

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The deep anger of Charles Haughey's government at the rejection of the Birmingham Six's 1988 appeal is evident in state papers from that year.

The Irish were also furious at the British attorney general's decision not to prosecute Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) officers involved in an alleged shoot-to-kill policy.
The information is disclosed in declassified files dating from 1988.
The Irish government's concerns were relayed at meetings in February 1988.
Irish Justice Minister Gerry Collins and Energy Minister Ray Burke made their views clear to British ministers.
At their first meeting at Stormont Castle in Belfast on 2 February, Mr Collins called it "a serious setback".
Among the issues that caused Dublin concern were the alleged "shoot-to-kill policy, the seriousness of which it was impossible to exaggerate; a cover-up involving senior RUC officers; a covert Special Branch operation in Irish jurisdiction and the disturbing circumstances of the removal of [John] Stalker from the Stalker Inquiry".
Mr Stalker, the deputy chief constable of Greater Manchester, was replaced as officer in charge of the investigation into an alleged RUC shoot-to-kill policy in north Armagh in 1982 by Colin Sampson, chief constable of West Yorkshire, in June 1986.
He was suspended after allegations he was associating with criminals in Manchester.
But he was later cleared of misconduct and reinstated with immediate effect.
On 5 February 1988, Mr Stalker claimed he had been taken off the Northern Ireland inquiry because his investigation showed that trained RUC squads had shot dead six unarmed republicans and then embarked on a cover-up.
Mr Collins told Northern Ireland Secretary Tom King that confidence in the RUC had received a "devastating setback" and north-south security co-operation would suffer when it was known that the RUC was shielding officers strongly suspected of serious crime.
In the Irish view, the Stalker-Sampson report should be published and all those against whom there was evidence of wrongdoing should be prosecuted, he said.
The Court of Appeal's decision to uphold the convictions of the Birmingham Six had serious consequences for confidence in the administration of justice.
Those prisoners should be released, he said.
This was one of the most serious and emotional issues in Mr Collins' public life and its impact in Ireland could not be over-emphasised, he told UK ministers.
Mr King said he appreciated both the strength of feeling and the calm way in which the points had been expressed.
He most regretted that the events of 1982 cast a cloud over the RUC.
However, in considering whether or not a prosecution was warranted in the Stalker-Sampson cases, Attorney General Sir Patrick Mayhew had been statutorily bound to consider the public interest.
Mr Collins pressed for prosecutions, not just disciplinary proceedings.
At the resumed meeting in London on 10 February, Mr King said "in strict confidence, Mr Stalker had done a lot of good work".
He added: "Some of the things which he was now saying in public were helpful, in particular his endorsement of the view that there had been no official shoot-to-kill policy and that it would be wrong to mount further prosecutions at this stage.
"However, the speculation that there had been some form of Cabinet plot to remove him from the inquiry was absolute rubbish."
On the Birmingham Six, Mr Collins asked "whether there was really no hope of clemency".
The case "smacked of a mighty cover-up", he said.
Mr King said three of the most eminent judges in the land had heard the case and there was "no question of his being able to reach a different and better conclusion".
The Irish minster said "he spoke in deep sorrow, not in anger" when he said that recent decisions "had done colossal damage to trust and confidence".
