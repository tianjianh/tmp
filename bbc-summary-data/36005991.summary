The 62-year-old man fell from the summit of Robinson near Buttermere, while walking in the Lake District on Friday.
Keswick Mountain Rescue Team called a coastguard helicopter which winched the injured man to a waiting air ambulance.
The man is being treated at Carlisle's Cumberland Infirmary.
A rescue team spokesman said the man plunged into a gully while descending the north side of Robinson.
"The prompt response of both air crews saved a large amount of time and effort in recovering the casualty and gave him the best possible chance of a good outcome," he said.
