Guidance on commercial dog walkers issued by SNH

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Organisations managing national parks and open spaces have been offered guidance on how to encourage visits by dog walking businesses.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Scottish Natural Heritage has issued the information after holding workshops for commercial dog walkers.
The events gathered the walkers' views on the availability of open spaces. Almost 40% said there were fewer places to take dogs than 10 years ago.
The guidance suggests benefits that can be drawn from dog walking businesses.
They include improvements in the welfare of dogs, but also the increased chance of land managers being alerted to vandalism and fly tipping.
The guidance also sets out some potential problems including that the appearance of large numbers of dogs "can be intimidating" to other visitors.
