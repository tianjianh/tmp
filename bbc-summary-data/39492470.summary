Called Still, it was designed by Glasgow-based architects Angus Ritchie and Daniel Tyler.
The box-like structure has mirrored interior walls that reflect the landscape that can be seen from two open ends of the installation.
Enhanced viewpoints have also been installed at Corgarff in Aberdeenshire and Glenshee in Perthshire.
They form part of the Snow Roads Scenic Route which runs from Blairgowrie to Grantown on Spey via Braemar and Tomintoul.
The route forms the highest public road in Britain, according to the Cairngorms National Park Authority.
It is regularly used by classic car and motorbike enthusiasts and increasingly cyclists.
