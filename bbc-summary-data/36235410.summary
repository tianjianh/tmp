Officers received a report of an unconscious and injured man found on Lion Street at about 01:00 BST on Sunday.
He was taken to hospital by ambulance but later died.
The Ministry of Defence has confirmed the man was a soldier and Dyfed-Powys Police said the death was being treated as unexplained.
It is understood the soldier was not wearing army uniform and there was nothing to indicate his death was linked to extremism.
The area has been cordoned off and anyone who was around Lion Street, Bethel Square, Tredegar Street and High Street between 00.30 and 01:30 is asked to call 101.
An Army spokesperson said: "We are aware of an incident involving the death of a soldier in Brecon.
"Dyfed-Powys Police are investigating and it would be inappropriate to comment further at this time."
