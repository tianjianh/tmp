[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Georgina Tranter, 26, from Narberth, was staying with William Harman at the Premier Inn in Haverfordwest after the Pembrokeshire Hunt Ball in January.
Swansea Crown Court heard police took her home after she became abusive but she took her mother's car, returned to the hotel and started the fire.
Tranter admitted arson being reckless as to whether life was endangered.
The judge told her: "It is clear you were not thinking rationally."
The court heard Mr Harman ended the relationship because she was getting too "clingy".
He told her to go home and said they would speak in the morning.
When he returned to the hotel, she was already there and was getting abusive with reception staff and the police were called.
They took her home but she returned in the early hours of the morning to start the fire and 133 hotel guests had to be evacuated.
The court heard she sent a text to a friend which said: "I've poured petrol on the Premier Inn. I'm in deep trouble. I'm on the run."
She was seen by the police at a nearby petrol station where she was arrested.
James Jenkins, defending, said: "An arsonist cannot return to testing petroleum spirit."
Tranter also admitted taking a car without consent.
Judge Peter Heywood told her: "You were clearly unhinged at being jilted."
