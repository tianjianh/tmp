Police Scotland's dog branch and air support unit have been deployed in the Irvine area in an effort to trace Gordon Speirs.
His disappearance was said to be totally out of character.
Mr Speirs is described as being 5ft 10in tall, of medium build, with red hair and blue eyes.
At the time of his disappearance he was wearing navy coloured combat trousers, a black waterproof jacket and timberland boots.
Insp David Carballo of Ayrshire Police Division said: "This is totally out of character for Gordon and his family are understandably very worried.
"With the deteriorating weather conditions and concerns for his health, we are keen to have him back home safely as soon as possible.
"I am appealing to anyone who may have seen him or indeed for Gordon himself to contact us by calling 101."
