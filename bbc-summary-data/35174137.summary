[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Heavy downpours expected across north Wales have prompted a yellow "be aware" warning for rain.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Met Office said the rain will gradually spread north across Wales on Christmas Day.
It will be "heavy at times", particularly over high ground, and is expected to continue into Boxing Day.
The warning is in place from 15:00 GMT on Friday until 23:45 on Saturday and there could be flooding and some disruption to transport.
Natural Resources Wales currently has two flood warnings in place for Tenby, Pembrokeshire, and the Lower Dee Valley, from Llangollen to Trevalyn Meadows, as well as more than 20 alerts across Wales.
Meanwhile, December is on course to be the warmest on record with temperatures averaging 9.3C (48.7F) - up 4.8C on the usual average for the month.
However, Wales has had more rain and less sunshine than anywhere else compared to the usual averages in the UK.
