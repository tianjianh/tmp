Your pets remembered

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
More and more of us are choosing to be buried with our pets. And an ever-growing number of pet owners feel they would like to give their animals a more personal send off.

BBC News website readers have been contacting us to share their memories and views. Here is a selection of them.
Eva Bradshaw, Newbury
"I had my cat Garlic cremated when she died at over 20 years of age. She had been my constant companion since I was 18, through many house moves and life changes.  Having never had children she became more than a pet to me. She had bags of personality and even bonafide cat-haters seemed to find her entertaining.
As someone who has moved house a fair amount, when she died I couldn't bear to bury her or even scatter her ashes, knowing I would likely move again.  She currently resides in a cat-shaped urn in my bedroom, waiting for when my time comes and we can be laid to rest together."
Coral Pearce-Mariner, Norwich
"Our beloved old Bichon Frise, Snowy, is buried at Penwith Pet Crematorium. It's a lovely space - it's not ordered in rows like a traditional human cemetery, but the burials and headstones (some people opt for no headstone, while others will go all out with an engraved piece of granite) seem to move with the land. There are wildflowers and trees dotted about, which makes it feel like a respectful and peaceful place. Snowy is buried under an apple tree. His neighbours are a human man and a parrot, to my recollection. It's a very inclusive space and I'm very glad it exists. Snowy was a huge part of the family, even though he was such a little dog. He comforted my mother, my sister and I through the sudden death of my father. We wanted to show Snowy the same respect in death that we were able to give dad, and having somewhere like this on our doorstep at the time was the perfect solution."
Angela Turner, Hartlepool
"Having owned a lot of pets and been involved in rescue,  I have used pet burials and pet cemeteries and now have my dogs cremated and keep their ashes at home.
It is the last thing you do for them and I can't bear to think of them being treated as waste.
I now design and create customised pet urns and see the comfort it gives to owners to have their pet home with them"
Carole Marriott, Hebburn, Tyne and Wear
"I had my dog and two cats cremated, then buried their ashes in ceramic plant pots with small shrubs in.  I can take them with me when I move house. I made plaques to remember them by".
Alison Caswell, Cardiff
"My beloved pet cat Domino died in front of my eyes just over a year ago, he was only three.  We have him buried in our back garden and to mark his grave we covered the plot with three oblong shaped slates, the middle one has four white dots printed on it to look like a domino, visitors think it's just a garden feature, not our precious animal's burial site.  Should we ever move in the future, he will be coming with us, along with the slate."

Anne, Sunderland says "I have one of my dogs buried in a pet cemetery. Four cats and a budgie were all cremated and their ashes are buried with my late husband's ashes in a huge planter in my garden. We both adored our pets. They were family members and I couldn't bare the thought of just leaving them completely. I wish the vet had told me that I could take my late pets home and the crematorium would have collected them from there. Some people think you're crazy and that it's just an animal but theses pets are often a life line for the elderly and lonely."
Stan Slater, Falkirk writes "I originally come from Cullen in Banffshire and there has been a pet cemetery there for many years. It is run by one local man and if your pet is buried there you normally give a donation. At the end of the year the donations are split and are given to local charities in the community by the person who runs it. The Queen even intervened to help its creation."
Lynda. A. Fellows, Preston says "Our much-loved cats have been cremated and their ashes scattered at the beautiful cemetery in Crawshawbooth.  We couldn't afford a single cremation, unfortunately, but we know where they are and we don't have to worry about their remains. The cemetery is beautifully kept, surrounded by trees, grieving owners can plant flowers, bushes etc. There are many beautiful graves and headstones, it is a lovely, peaceful place, lovingly cared for by its owners. It is not silly nor stupid to love your animals and want them treated with respect."
Sharon, Kilkeel, Northern Ireland writes "We have a section of our garden at the family home specifically designated as our pets' final resting place, with a small headstone to each one. Each year on the anniversary of their passing, there is a floral tribute laid on their grave - they were considered as family members and remembered in the same way.
