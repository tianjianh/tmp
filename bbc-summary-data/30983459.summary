[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The "eco-town", made up of energy-efficient houses, will be built over the next 20 years on land to the north west of the Oxfordshire town.
Cherwell District Council's draft Supplementary Planning Document for the site is out to consultation until 20 February.
It was due to end on 23 January.
The document provides guidance to developers and will be used to guide future planning applications for the north west of the town if approved.
Construction of the "eco-town" development, known as the Exemplar, began in April and will include a primary school, shops, offices and an eco-business centre.
The initial 393 homes, including 119 that will be affordable, are expected to be completed within four-and-a-half years.
