Thirty years since Johnny and Baby first appeared in cinemas and created a cult hit, the producers of the TV remake have offered a glimpse at the updated version.
Starring Little Miss Sunshine star Abigail Breslin as Frances "Baby" Houseman and Colt Pratte as Johnny Castle, it recounts their 1987 love story and what happened to their romance after the summer ended.
Fans will relive memorable scenes like the lift in the lake, dancing on the log, and the infamous: "Nobody puts baby in the corner."
The stars of the remake also teased viewers with their own images on social media.
Breslin shared photos of herself dancing in front of a fireplace with a shirtless Pratte. In one he is seen dipping Breslin backwards and another sees her dancing with her arms above her head.
She captioned the shots: "Casually dancing around a fireplace, as one does," and "just casually dippin' around a fireplace. As one also does."
Modern Family star Sarah Hyland, who plays Baby's sister Lisa Houseman, also shared a photo on Instagram of herself in costume.
Will and Grace star Debra Messing, who plays their mother Marjorie, posted pictures including a shot of the Houseman family sitting around a table when Johnny tells them: "No one puts Baby in the corner."
She also included a picture of former Pussycat Doll Nicole Scherzinger dancing in character as Penny Rivera. She captioned the collection: "The Catskills are alive with music and [dancing emojis]."
The three-hour TV movie will be broadcast on US network ABC on 24 May, and promises to take the story beyond where the 1987 film ended.
