Football fans from rival Bristol clubs have arrived at Wembley, after walking over 100 miles (160 km) from Bristol.

The sponsored walk by Bristol City and Rovers supporters was to raise money for six-year-old Oskar Pycroft, from Whitchurch, who has cerebral palsy.
It is hoped surgery, unavailable on the NHS and costing around Â£50,000, could help the young City fan to walk.
Oskar is due to lead City out at Wembley for the Johnstone's Paint Trophy final against Walsall later.
Scott Wright, who organised the walk, said it had been a "tough four-and-a-half days".
"There's been a lot of tears, a lot of low points but knowing Oskar would be at the other end meeting us is what's got us through," he said.
"He even rang us on Friday, at probably our lowest point, and gave us a bit of a pep talk - ending with, 'man up and get on with it'. He's pretty blunt sometimes but you've got to love him for it."
With more than 70,000 tickets sold, Bristol City's clash with Walsall in the Johnstone's Paint Trophy final will be one of the best-attended games in the UK this weekend.
