[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Wes Morgan salvaged a replay for Leicester City in an FA Cup fourth-round tie with Derby County which will be remembered for a remarkable Darren Bent own goal.

Rams striker Bent put the Premier League champions ahead when he scuffed a clearance into his own net while under no pressure trying to clear a corner.
However the former England forward made up for that when he headed Will Hughes' cross into the right net to level the scores.
Craig Bryson put Championship side Derby ahead when he picked the ball up 25 yards out, surged past three Foxes defenders and fired the ball across Kasper Schmeichel with a slight deflection off Robert Huth.
The Foxes, who hit the post through Demarai Gray, looked as if they were heading out of the cup before captain Morgan headed home Gray's corner.
Derby had a late appeal for a penalty turned down when Abdoul Camara's shot hit Huth's hand.
The replay at the King Power Stadium will be played on Wednesday, 8 February (19:45 GMT).
Bent has made a career from close-range tap-ins, but he has never 'scored' one like his opener before.
Marc Albrighton's corner was headed towards goal by Foxes defender Huth. The ball landed to Chris Baird, who tried to control the ball on his thigh but it went away from him back towards team-mate Bent.
The former Sunderland striker, standing just in front of the line, had plenty of time to control the ball or smash it to safety. But as he swung his foot to clear, the ball hit the side of his boot and flew behind him into the back of the net.
Match of the Day summariser Graeme Le Saux called it "just the most bizarre goal". The former England defender added: "It is just terrible. From an experienced player, he's got time, he sees the ball. How he fails to get decent contact on it, baffling. I don't think I've ever seen anything like it. He almost kicks it backwards into the net."
BBC Radio 5 live's Andy Townsend said: "He could have taken a touch before clearing. He didn't need to slash at it."
"I don't know what happened," said Bent after the game. "I lost concentration and tried to hit the ball as hard as I could and it flew into the net. It wasn't the greatest start. Fair play to us to stick at it."
Bent made amends with a goal at the right end when Schmeichel punched a corner to Hughes, whose cross was met by Bent with a glancing header to turn the ball past the keeper into the corner of the net.
"It was playing on my mind, I thought 'what have I done here'? But I scored at the other end," he added.
The 32-year-old striker has now scored in 10 of his past 11 FA Cup games, including all five for Derby.
Leicester named a strong team, with nine of their regular starting 11 from last season's title-winning team starting - and a 10th, Riyad Mahrez, coming on midway through the second half.
But as has been the case for most of their title defence so far - they sit five points above the relegation zone - they looked nothing like the 2015-16 legends.
However, they did have enough chances to score before eventually equalising.
Half-time substitute Gray should have levelled when Albrighton's cross was punched away by Scott Carson to the winger, who shot the rebound straight at the former England keeper.
And then moments later, he went even closer when his low shot from the edge of the box hit the post. The ball landed to Shinji Okazaki, whose first effort was blocked and his second - like his team-mate had done a minute before - shot straight at Carson, who was on the ground.
And, as if to sum up the difference between this season and last, Jamie Vardy - scorer of 24 goals last term and six this time around - headed straight at Carson from about six yards out.
But Morgan kept them in the cup with his late intervention, albeit in a replay neither side really wanted.
While Derby are challenging for the play-offs, Leicester now have to juggle a Premier League relegation battle, a campaign in the Champions League knockout stages and an FA Cup replay.
Derby boss Steve McClaren joked after the game that he would have brought on more strikers at the end to force a winner for either side if he could.
Derby manager Steve McClaren: "We did everything we could, we came across a team who were at it tonight. Our character was fantastic, we dug in in the second half and Scott Carson made some saves when we needed him to.
"The penalty incident? It's hit his hand and it's on target. I've seen them given but we didn't get the luck. We fought to the end, neither of us wanted a draw but what a cup tie. It was a great game, great atmosphere and I am proud of the players."
Leicester manager Claudio Ranieri: "It was a tough match. We started well and scored but slowly we lost our calm. They played well and scored twice. In the second half we again started well and created two or three chances. It was tough to score but thankfully Morgan got one for us.
"We have to concentrate. Too many times we concede. We can only work and be more focused."
Both sides have away trips on Tuesday. Derby, outside the Championship play-offs by two points, visit mid-table Ipswich Town, with Leicester going to Burnley in the Premier League.
