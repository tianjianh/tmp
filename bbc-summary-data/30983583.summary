Baby can't be named Nutella, French court says

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A French court has ruled that a baby cannot be named Nutella because it is against the child's interest.

French newspaper La Voix Dunord revealed a judge in the city of Valencienne renamed the child Ella after the parents failed to turn up to a court date in November.
The court's decision noted that Nutella was the trade name of a spread.
"A name like that can only lead to teasing or disparaging comments," it stated.
In a separate case, another family from Raismes, who named their child Fraise (Strawberry), were also told the name could be detrimental to the child.
The parents then re-named their child Fraisine, an old French name.
Many countries restrict baby names, including Germany, Sweden, China, Iceland and Japan.
In Iceland, there is a list of 1,853 female names, and 1,712 male ones, and parents must pick from these lists or seek permission from a special committee.
In 2007, a New Zealand couple blocked from naming their baby 4Real instead settled on calling him Superman.
And in Germany in 2002, officials refused to allow a Turkish couple living in Cologne to name their baby boy Osama Bin Laden.
The UK has much more liberal rules on baby names.
There are no restrictions on parents, apart from exceptional cases, when an official can refuse to register it if the name is deemed offensive.
