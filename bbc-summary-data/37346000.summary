Relive Tuesday's EFL Cup action
Newcastle Rafael Benitez manager on Gouffran:
"I was happy with him during pre-season. I was expecting some offers for him during the summer - we had one that was not good enough. I was expecting maybe no-one would come and I would be happy, so that was the situation.
"I am really pleased because when you have someone working so hard, he deserves some luck sometimes.
"He didn't know what would happen in the future, but still he was working hard, so I am really pleased for him and he is scoring great goals now. Especially from volleys, so that is good."
Wolves boss Walter Zenga:
"We made a big gift in one minute and the game was over in that one minute because of our two mistakes in defensive situations.
"When you make some gifts in this way, it's difficult then to come back into the game.
"Before they scored the goals, we had one great chance, unbelievable, one v one with the keeper and we missed. In the second half, we would have had something to open up the game.
"But unfortunately, we didn't score and the game was in the hands of the home team."
