The Canadian, 28, was picked as the Devils' forward of the year in 2016-17 after scoring 24 goals and 29 assists in 66 games.
Haddad was a dominant force last season, playing the role of a power forward as Devils won the Elite League.
"Joey Haddad was outstanding for us last season," said Devils player-coach Andrew Lord.
"There were a number of games that he completely took over or broke open a game for us and that is what makes fans love him so much.
"He is a big body and dominates in the corners and is tough to play against.
"There were a number of teams that wanted him to make a move but he loves it here and I don't really think he entertained any other offers."
Haddad will also be a vital part of Devils' Champions Hockey League campaign, with the Welsh side drawn in Group E against HC Davos from Switzerland, Bili Tygri Liberec of the Czech Republic and Sweden's Vaxjo Lakers.
