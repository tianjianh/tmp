A 200-yard (180m) section of the Cumbria Coast Line at Flimby remains closed after flooding washed away a section of embankment on Friday.
Train operator Northern Rail said buses were being used between Carlisle and Workington.
However, the company said train services had resumed between Workington and Barrow-in-Furness.
Network Rail said engineers faced a "huge task" of repairing the damage strong winds and high tides caused to the coastal rail route.
A spokesman for Northern Rail added: "The line between Barrow and Workington has reopened to train services.
"The Cumbrian Coast Line had been closed following significant damage caused by storms and flooding.
"A number of sites were affected and Network Rail engineers have worked over the weekend to reinstate the railway at many of these locations so trains can operate between Workington and Barrow.
"However, at Flimby, where the storm washed away over 200 yards of track, the scale of the damage means that sea defences need to be rebuilt before work can begin to reinstate the track.
"Early indications are that this will take Network Rail around one week to complete.
"A bus replacement service will operate between Carlisle and Workington."
Environment Agency flood warnings remain in place for the Cumbrian coast from Gretna to St Bees, including North Morecambe Bay.
