[SN]TITLE[SN]
TrawsCymru to resume Aberystwyth to Cardiff bus service

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Buses between Aberystwyth and Cardiff will resume later this month, the Welsh Government has confirmed.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
TrawsCymru's new T1C service replaces the previous 701 service which was operated by Lewis Coaches before it went into administration in August.
It will run alongside the hourly T1 bus service between Aberystwyth and Carmarthen, which connects with the rail line at Carmarthen.
The service will be reviewed after six months.
Economy and Infrastructure Secretary Ken Skates said he was "delighted" TrawsCymru was able to take on the "important route".
"Following the sudden closure of Lewis coaches, we've acted quickly with the local authority and others to ensure that critical services were continued with as little disruption as possible," he added.
