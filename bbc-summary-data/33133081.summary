Nick Palmer, 37, collapsed at the finish line of the Southend half marathon in June 2014.
His son, George, seven, sounded the klaxon to set more than 2,000 runners on their way in Shoeburyness on Sunday.
Parents Alan and Linda Palmer said their son had a "passion for running" and the event was a "fitting tribute".
"This past year we have been overwhelmed with the kind messages of support from Nick's friends, family, running club colleagues and the local community - it has meant a great deal to us," they said.
Mr Palmer's family raised more than Â£10,000 in his memory, which was donated to Great Ormond Street Hospital, where George had received treatment.
Mr and Mrs Palmer said this year's event was "emotional for all those who knew and loved Nick", but added it had been "wonderful to see everyone coming together to remember him in this way."
Judy Grocott, Events Manager at Havens Hospices, said: "Following Nick's tragic death last year we wanted to remember him and honour his memory at this year's run."
The event, which marked the 20th anniversary of the coastal run, raised money for Fair Havens and Little Havens hospices.
