[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The hosts were on top in the early stages of the game with Billy Sharp putting a first-time effort off target, Daniel Lafferty seeing his drive deflected wide and Done forcing Luke McGee to make a superb reflex save.
Done scored the game's only goal after 13 minutes, steering the ball past McGee at the near post after meeting Kieron Freeman's low cross.
Peterborough's Chris Forrester then had a long-range shot deflected wide while Blades goalkeeper Simon Moore produced a fine save down to his right to keep out Paul Taylor's shot on the turn.
Substitute Stefan Scougall went close to scoring a second goal for the home side in the second half when his 20-yard effort was palmed wide by McGee.
Moore protected his side's lead when he pulled off a great save to keep out Gwion Edwards' close-range shot. The keeper also stopped efforts from Forrester and Marcus Maddison.
