Cardiff Devils sealed a dream weekend after overcoming Belfast Giants 4-3 in overtime to maintain their bid to win the Elite League.

That came after the Devils won their first game at their new home to lift the Erhardt Conference.
Saturday's fine 5-2 win over Belfast Giants applied to both competitions and was watched by a near capacity crowd at the new Ice Arena Wales.
The Devils remain two points behind Sheffield Steelers in the Elite League.
The Devils trailed the Giants 2-0 at the end of the first period, but responded through a Jack Morissette double and a goal from Zach Hervato in the second period as the score became 3-3.
The third period could not split the sides, but Tomas Kurka settled matters in overtime.
"Maybe something new and something different was what we needed and with it being opening night, how could you not be energised by that?," player-coach Andrew Lord told BBC Wales Sport after the victory on Saturday.
"The fans were great, we had our swagger back and it was just a special evening for everyone and we had fun with it."
