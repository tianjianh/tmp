The 47-year-old competed for Team GB in Rio just 10 months after being placed in an induced coma following a fall in the World Young Horse Championships.
Fox-Pitt was part of the team which finished fifth in the three-day eventing and was placed 12th individually in the show-jumping.
"To get here has certainly been a big journey for me," he told BBC Sport.
Fox-Pitt, from Sturminster Newton in Dorset, made a dream start on day one when he lead the standings after the dressage but fell down to 21st after a disappointing cross-country round.
The three-time Olympic medallist, aboard Chilli Morning, produced a faultless performance in Tuesday's final show-jumping phase.
"I really believed that Rio was realistic," Fox-Pitt told BBC Radio 5 live. "It was my goal and my target personally and it got me back to full strength.
"I never doubted it. For my family and my wife, it's been very, very tough.
"The stats were against me mentally and physically, but it all came right."
