The club was relegated on Saturday despite the team's 3-2 win over Motherwell.
Hamilton's win over Dundee meant Caley Thistle could not leapfrog the Accies into second-bottom place.
In a post on the club's Facebook page, Inverness thanked fans for their "continued patience".
It is the second time in its history that the Highlands club has been relegated.
The last time was in 2009, but the Caley Jags successfully secured promotion in the following season.
In the message on Facebook, the club said: "The ICTFC directors appreciate your continued patience and a statement on how the club intends to move forward will be issued in due course."
