Ghana vice-captain Andrew Ayew has offered to pay the travel costs for seven Black Stars so they can play in Saturday's Africa Cup of Nations tie.

Ayew stepped in after Ghana's Ministry of Youth and Sport said it will not pay for the travel of foreign-based players for the match against Rwanda in Accra.
The Ministry has asked the Ghana Football Association to field only locally-based players.
Ghana have already qualified for the finals and Rwanda have been eliminated.
That has led Ghana's MOYS to believe its funds would be better spent elsewhere.
However, Ghana coach Avram Grant wants his best players to be available so they can use the match as preparation for a World Cup qualifier against Congo in October.
Ayew himself, who plays his football for English Premier League side West Ham, will miss the game because of a thigh problem.
The GFA's director of communications Ibrahim Sannie told BBC Sport: "The players themselves have decided to pay for their own tickets to Accra. Unfortunately there are a few players who are unable to pay for themselves, so Andre Ayew has decided to pay for them.
"And although Ayew is injured he will come to Accra to support the players."
