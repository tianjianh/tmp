The drug had been injected into the soles of the sports shoes to look like shock-absorbing gel.
Customs officials became suspicious after finding the man's suitcase contained six pairs of trainers and almost nothing else.
Italian police said the drugs haul had a street value of more 2m euros (Â£1.8m/$2.2m).

The man, who had said he flew to Rome for a short holiday, has been detained on charges of smuggling seven kilograms (15.4Ib) of narcotics into Italy.
The arrest followed a random check on passengers arriving at Rome's main airport from Sao Paulo, Brazil.
"Only an expert would have been able to tell the liquid wasn't the usual gel," Italy's financial police said.
