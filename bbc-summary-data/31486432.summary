The World Pooh Sticks Championships is moving to a new location, organisers have announced.

The event will take place at Langel Common, near Witney, Oxfordshire, following logistical problems at its previous location of 31 years, the Rotary Club of Oxford Spires said.
The bridge over the River Windrush links Witney with Cogges Manor Farm, a filming location for Downton Abbey.
A club spokeswoman said they were "thrilled" with the new venue.
The farm has seen its visitor numbers rise since being used as a location for the ITV drama and plans to hold a "Stick Day" event to tie in with the championships.
The event, based on the game in AA Milne's Winnie the Pooh stories, was previously held on the Thames at Day's Lock in Little Wittenham.
Organisers had appealed for help in finding an alternative venue due to the level of boat traffic on the Thames and because the 2013 event was cancelled after winter flooding.
The first championships at the new venue are due to take place on 7 June.
