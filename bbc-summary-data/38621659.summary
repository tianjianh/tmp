[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
About 12,000 litres of paint have been spilt over a motorway following an HGV crash.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The white paint has pooled across the M606 southbound in Bradford after 12 containers fell off the lorry.
The motorway is shut from Staygate to the Euroway industrial estate while a clean-up operation gets under way.
West Yorkshire Police said it was trying to establish what caused the crash. Highways England said the road needed to be resurfaced.
Nigel Fawcett-Jones, from the force, said: "One of the challenges is that it's hazardous to the environment and they can't just flush it down the drain.
"So they are trying their best to find a method to get it off the carriageway and dispose of it in a safe and appropriate manner."
Motorists have been urged to avoid the area.
