James Jefferson, 37, admitted purchasing the illegal items which arrived in the UK in February 2013.
They were uncovered after packaging was x-rayed by UK Border Force officials at the Parcelforce hub in Coventry.
The High Court in Glasgow heard that the items were addressed to Jefferson's partner at their then address in the Scotstounhill area of Glasgow.
Advocate depute Neil Beardmore, prosecuting, said: "The package was inspected and found to contain 10 stun guns, which looked like Nokia mobile phones.
"They are designed as self-defence weapons. They are not lethal, but deliver a high voltage pulse, sufficient to cause temporary incapacity. They were in working order."
The court heard that initially Jefferson denied ordering the items, but subsequently admitted his guilt.
Computers and paperwork, which were seized during a search of Jefferson's home, confirmed that he was using a Chinese website.
Judge Lord Bannatyne told Jefferson he would have been jailed for 21 months but for his guilty plea.
