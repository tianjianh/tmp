A painting of the Lord Bishop of Sodor and Man has been unveiled by an artist in the Isle of Man.

The work is the second in a series of Tynwald Day portraits by Russian artist Svetlana Cameron.
Mrs Cameron said she was inspired after attending the annual ceremony last year.
Her latest work shows the Rt Rev Robert Paterson in the parish church of Saint John the Baptist in his convocational robes and holding the diocesan crozier.
The Bishop described the painting as "brilliant and quite remarkable in its attention both to the spirit and the detail".
He added: "The thought that succeeding generations may look at this painting fills me with a sense of respect that a photograph could never achieve."
Mrs Cameron, who works out of her Braddan studio, said: "I came to live in the Island nine years ago and, long before I went to St John's on Tynwald Day, watched the ceremony live on television.
"Immediately I became interested in the pageantry and the central characters, among them the Bishop, who kindly agreed to sit for the portrait.
"I chose to place him in the church because, on Tynwald Day, everything starts there with the service, such an important part of the ceremony."
The Bishop sat on five occasions for the painting which is being displayed for the first time at St German's Cathedral.
