The 25-year-old, who spent last season at Launceston, was part of the Cornwall side that won the County Championship final at Twickenham under the guidance of Albion boss Graham Dawe.
He also scored 13 points for England Counties against Romania 'A' this week.
"It's a possibility, but no decision has been made yet," Shepherd told BBC Radio Cornwall.
"The option is hopefully there and I wouldn't mind giving it a crack to go a bit higher, but I've just got to make sure it's the right thing to do and the right time," he added.
Dawe has already said he would like to bring a number of players from that side to Plymouth.
Meanwhile, Plymouth Albion have signed three Exeter Chiefs academy players on season-long loans.
Scrum-half Jack Maunder, forward Ed Holmes and winger Harrison Cully have all agreed to move.
They will all play in National One for Albion following their relegation from the Championship in April.
"All three players will be with us for the season, which will provide us with more continuity," said Albion director of rugby Graham Dawe.
Dawe is hoping to continue to add to his squad as he look to rebuild following last season's campaign, when they ended their 13-year stay in English rugby's second tier.
He has already agreed deals with Australians Marc Koteczky and Ethan Ford, as well as Cameron Setter and Dan Pullinger.
