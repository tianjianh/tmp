[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Renfrewshire rivals St Mirren and Morton had to make do with a point each in their Scottish Championship opener.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Michael Tidser had already skimmed the Saints crossbar with a shot before Thomas O'Ware headed Jim Duffy's Greenock men in front after 17 minutes.
St Mirren manager Alex Rae changed his formation to a 3-4-3 and saw an immediate improvement.
Lewis Morgan's cross into the box was met by the towering substitute John Sutton to nod home for the draw.
Morton started the game with pace and, after Tidser's 25-yard shot in seven minutes had grazed the woodwork, they had the bar shaking again when the unmarked Lee Kilday rattled it with a header.
The Ton made the breakthrough when Ross Forbes' great free-kick was bulleted into the net by O'Ware from close range.
The Saints fans had to wait until the 20th minute to see a chance for their side, David Clarkson's low shot drifting wide of the far post.
And their old rivals should have doubled their lead soon after when Gary Oliver teed up Jai Quitongo but he sclaffed his shot wide.
In the second half St Mirren's Calum Gallagher found Lawrence Shankland at the edge of the box, but Kilday blocked the shot.
Saints goalkeeper Jamie Langfield saved a snatched shot by Gary Oliver to keep his team in the match and with seven minutes remaining Sutton headed the leveller.
Duffy and Rae were animated on the touchline as they willed their teams to find the winner, but both had to be content with the draw.
