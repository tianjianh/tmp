A senior Indian civil servant has resigned after reports that he interfered in a police investigation into a major financial scandal.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Reports said Anil Goswami had tried to halt the arrest of a former minister in connection with a multi-billion dollar Ponzi scheme that went bust in 2013.
He retired from his post as home secretary, but Indian media reported he was forced out by the government.
Last week, the government also removed top foreign official Sujatha Singh.
Her term of office as foreign secretary was due to expire next August, but the government cut it short because it was reportedly unhappy with her performance.
Mr Goswami reportedly phoned India's Central Bureau of Investigations (CBI) to stall the arrest of Matang Sinh, a former minister under the previous Congress government.
The home department later said Mr Goswami, who has not commented on the case, opted for early retirement.
Mr Sinh has since been detained as part of the inquiry into a Ponzi scheme run by the Saradha Group, a consortium of about 200 companies that raised more than $3bn (Â£2bn) from mostly poor investors.
Federal investigators have already arrested top regional politicians for links to Saradha.
