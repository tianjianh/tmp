Spanish media are reporting the 70-year-old is in a "serious but not critical" condition in hospital after the quad bike he was riding collided with a car on Wednesday.
Nieto won 13 titles and 90 Grands Prix in a 22-year career between 1964 and 1986.
"All our thoughts today are very much with Angel Nieto," said MotoGP.
