A second loss in three league games leaves Napoli six points behind the defending champions, who are at home to Palermo on Sunday (14:00 BST).
Captain Mauro Icardi put Inter ahead with his 15th goal of the season before Marcelo Brozovic doubled the lead.
Roberto Mancini's side moved to within three points of Roma in the third Champions League qualification place.
Roma are away to Atalanta on Sunday (11.30 BST).
Napoli, still missing suspended top scorer Gonzalo Higuain, have just five games left to try and overhaul champions Juventus to win a first league title since 1990.
They fell behind after four minutes when Gary Medel floated the ball through for Icardi, who looked fractionally offside, to steer the ball past Pepe Reina.
The former Liverpool keeper was beaten again a minute before half-time when Stevan Jovetic and Icardi combined to set up Brozovic for a neat finish.
Jose Maria Callejon volleyed just wide for Napoli after the break but Milan went closest to adding a further goal as Jovetic's chip was headed off the line by Kalidou Koulibaly.
Elsewhere, fourth-bottom Carpi helped their survival hopes with a 4-1 win over Genoa, while Torino moved into the top half after securing a third successive win with a 1-0 victory at Bologna.
Inter Milan captain Mauro Icardi: "I always said that we are a team that can fight for the top spots.
"We showed it tonight and in the Italian Cup against Juve (losing on penalties). We had an extraordinary first half of the season, we did badly in January, now let's see where we can finish.
"We have to think about ourselves only and then we will see at the end of the season what the other teams will have done too."
