The month did get off to a promising start as the thermometer hit 25C at Aldergrove in County Antrim on 1 July.
But just two weeks later Katesbridge in County Down recorded the UK's lowest temperature in July, a chilly -0.6C.
That was the fourth lowest July temperature on record for Northern Ireland.
A number of weather stations also set new individual records for the lowest average July temperatures including:
July was also wetter than normal, with Northern Ireland getting 137% of its average rainfall of 111mm.
However, the Julys of 2007 to 2010 inclusive were significantly wetter.
The Giant's Causeway set a new individual record for the amount of rain that fell there.
It recorded 112mm, up from its previous record of 99mm for the month of July.
It was a similar picture for Magilligan on the north coast, where 103mm of rain fell, beating its previous record of 81mm.
It is worth noting that both weather stations at the Giant's Causeway and Magilligan are relatively new sites.
In terms of sunshine, it was a duller than normal month with just 80% of the average amount of sun.
That was similar to July 2012.
Thomastown set a new individual record for the lowest amount of sunshine.
It recorded just 87 hours of sun for the whole of July, down from an average of 139 hours.
