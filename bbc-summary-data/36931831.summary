England's 1966 World Cup win has been marked by a special Wembley event exactly 50 years on.

Two of the team's stars, Sir Bobby Charlton and Sir Geoff Hurst, recounted memories at Wembley Arena as the crowd of 10,000 relived the historic day.
Actors including Martin Freeman read the words of fans and players, including the late Sir Bobby Moore.
There was also live music from performers including Sophie Ellis-Bextor, Reef and the Troggs.
Chris Farlowe gave a one-off performance of his 1966 hit Out of Time - which was number one in the charts half a century ago.
The audience heard fans' memories of that July Saturday, including stories of weddings where men wore earpieces connected to radios so they could listen to the commentary.
The match ended with Alf Ramsey's England side beating West Germany 4-2 in extra time.
It was a day when the names of Banks, Cohen, Wilson, Charlton J, Moore, Ball, Stiles, Peters, Charlton R, Hunt and Hurst earned their place in football history.
The hashtag #worldcup1966 is trending on Twitter, and the Foreign Office has tweeted to say the UK's ambassador to Azerbaijan has met the family of Tofiq Bahramov - the Azerbaijani linesman who awarded Sir Geoff's second goal.
But a tweet from actor Gary Kemp shows not everyone was paying close attention at the time.
"Six years old and bored of my family watching the match I went out on my own to the empty park and sat on a swing. #worldcup1966," he tweeted.

Bobby Moore and Alan Ball have since died, in 1993 and 2007 respectively. A bronze statue of Moore stands outside Wembley Stadium and is likely to be visited by many of fans attending the commemoration at the nearby arena.
At 21:00 BST, ITV will broadcast a documentary called 1966 - A Nation Remembers.
