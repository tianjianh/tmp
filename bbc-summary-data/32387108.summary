It joins several other local papers as well as a host of national broadsheets on the list of 2015 award winners.
The 2015 Pulitzer Prizes, US journalism's top awards, were announced at Columbia University.
The prizes also recognise achievement in drama, music and fiction, as well as non-fiction books.
Among the winners is The Post and Courier of Charleston, South Carolina, which won the Pulitzer Prize for public service for an examination of the deadly toll of domestic abuse.
The Seattle Times newsroom reportedly erupted in celebration when staff got word that the paper had won an award for its coverage of a deadly mudslide.
The New York Times won the international reporting award for what the judges described as courageous work on the front-line, in telling vivid human stories about Ebola.
The feature photography prize went to a New York Times freelancer, Daniel Berehulak, for his powerful images of those affected by the outbreak in Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone.
Bloomberg News, the Los Angeles Times and the Washington Post also took home awards.
The awards also highlighted literary, drama and music achievement.
Anthony Doerr's All the Light We Cannot See, a novel set in World War II that has been one of the top-selling literary works of the past year, won the Pulitzer Prize for fiction.
Judges awarded Stephen Adly Guirgis's Between Riverside and Crazy the prize for drama. They praised the playwright for his use of "dark comedy to confront questions of life and death".
The play tells the story of a former police officer who shelters orphans at his New York property.
