Southampton centre back Virgil van Dijk is unlikely to play again this season as he recovers from a damaged ligament in his foot.

The 25-year-old has not played since sustaining the injury in a 3-0 victory over Leicester in January.
The Dutch international subsequently underwent surgery and was expected to be out for up to three months.
However, the club have now said Van Dijk will not be "risked unnecessarily" despite his recovery progressing well.
Striker Charlie Austin could return from a long-term shoulder injury in three weeks, according to boss Claude Puel.
Saints are currently 10th in the Premier League, with 11 games remaining this season.
