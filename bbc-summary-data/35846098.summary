The Bakers Food and Allied Workers Union said members voted for Wednesday's 24 hour walkout at Allied Bakeries after changes to holiday entitlements and shift patterns.
Union representative John James said he hoped the issue could be resolved.
The company said it was in discussions with unions.
Mr James said 56 out of 70 workers who cast ballots voted for industrial action, timed to coincide with the lead-up to Easter.
Mike Auden, general manager at Allied Bakeries Wales, said: "We can confirm that we are in discussions with unions at our Cardiff bakery regarding a wage related matter.
"We are listening to employees and working hard to maintain open and constructive dialogue with our workforce.
"On that basis we hope that the strike action called for next week will not go ahead."
