The suspension, starting on 20 March, was imposed after Healy was sent to the stands for the third time this season.
Meanwhile, the club has been fined Â£1,250 for an incident involving former chairman Jim Kerr in the 3 January game against Coleraine.
Linfield were also given a warning regarding a public address incident in the Boxing Day match with Glentoran.
Kerr, who stood down as chairman on 10 January, received a two-match suspension and five-match stadium ban.
The committee also issued a warning to the club "regarding the future conduct of its supporters".
Northern Ireland's record scorer Healy was ordered from the dugout in the 1-1 draw with Portadown on 17 February.
"Mr Healy confirmed that a red card offence had occurred which equated to the 3rd occasion of misconduct this season," the committee said.
"The committee, having considered written and oral submissions from the club, deemed the challenge unsuccessful."
Linfield have the right to appeal the decisions made by the committee.
