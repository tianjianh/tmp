[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A life sciences business on Skye has developed medical kits for humans and horses, with financial help from Highlands and Islands Enterprise (HIE).

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Dunvegan-based Gaeltec Devices Ltd has made a portable piece of equipment to help diagnose gastrointestinal and urological disorders in people.
It has also created a specialised catheter for the treatment of horses with irregular heartbeats.
The projects were assisted by Â£331,000 from HIE.
Alison Gainsford, head of business growth at HIE, said: "Gaeltec Devices Ltd proves location does not limit the scope for technology based companies to expand in rural parts of the Highlands and Islands.
"Life science businesses generally have a positive international outlook and the high quality jobs at Gaeltec are of vital importance to the social and economic sustainability of Dunvegan and the surrounding area."
