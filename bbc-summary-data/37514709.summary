Israeli police chief Roni Alsheikh said preventative arrests were carried out on Arab and Jewish suspects who it was feared might disrupt the ceremony.
World leaders including US President Barack Obama are due to attend.
The body of Mr Peres has been lying in state outside parliament.
Mr Alsheikh told reporters that there were no specific threats to the funeral but police were prepared for any incident.
"We are dealing with an operation on an unprecedented scale," he said.
The funeral is expected to be the largest such event in Israel since the funeral of Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, who was assassinated by a Jewish nationalist in 1995.
Mr Peres suffered a stroke two weeks ago and died on Wednesday, aged 93, in a hospital near Tel Aviv.
Thousands of Israelis passed by his coffin outside the Knesset (parliament) throughout Thursday to pay their respects.
Israeli leaders including President Reuven Rivlin and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu also placed wreaths in a solemn ceremony.
Former US President Bill Clinton flew into Tel Aviv on Thursday and travelled directly to the Knesset to pay his respects.
Mr Clinton helped to broker the 1993 Oslo peace accords for which Mr Peres won the Nobel Peace Prize the following year along with Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat.
Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas has said he also plans to attend the funeral along with Palestinian chief negotiator Saeb Erekat and security chief Majid Faraj.
Other leaders set to attend include UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, French President Francois Hollande, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull and Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto.
