[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Syed Ali attacked the teenager in Sunderland's Mowbray Park on 8 December last year.
Ali, from the city's Barnes area, was found guilty after a trial at Newcastle Crown Court.
Det Insp Phil Bond said Ali had "preyed on his victim, befriending her and quickly gaining her trust before subjecting her to a horrific attack".
He said: "I hope the victim and her family can now move on from what has been an incredibly distressing time and can come to terms with what has happened and rebuild their lives.
"Although we know this sentence will in no way help erase what has happened, we hope there is some comfort in knowing Ali is now in prison."
