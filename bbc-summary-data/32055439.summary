Rebecca Wooller and Blake Green are celebrating their marriage at Morrisons in Cambourne, Cambridgeshire.
Their first date was a plate of chicken curry and chips in the store cafe as Ms Wooller was ill at the time and unable to travel far from her home.
They will have the same meal in the same place at their wedding reception.
Ms Wooller, 44, was introduced to Mr Green, 53, by their landlady in September.
Their first date in the store turned into a plan to wed at the unusual venue.
The couple admitted to being "mad as a box of frogs" for choosing to marry in a supermarket but said it held "real sentimental memories for us".
"I'm going to be walking down the middle of the store which is the Easter egg aisle at the moment, to 'Love is an Open Door' from the film Frozen," Ms Wooller said.
"We want other people to have a good day themselves if they're in there shopping and have a laugh with us."
"Morrisons have basically done all the planning for us and we've just invited anyone who wants to, to turn up," Mr Green added.
The reception will take place in the restaurant and will consist of "30 portions of chicken curry".
Store manager Gemma Avery said: "Everyone is absolutely thrilled for Becca and Blake. We've all been honoured to be part of their big day."
The couple will be officially married at a registry office before a celebrant presides over their supermarket wedding.
They have asked for donations to the Alzheimer's Society in lieu of gifts and collection buckets will be placed in the shop.
