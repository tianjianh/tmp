Scientists have found out that there are two different ways that they can pop.
It all depends on whether the balloon is popped with something sharp or or filled with too much air.
They found that if the balloon is popped by something sharp, it splits into two pieces. If it's filled with too much air, it shatters into lots of tiny pieces.
