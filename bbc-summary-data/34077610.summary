Can YouTubers find success at the Edinburgh Fringe?

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Twenty three-year-old Jon Cozart has come to the Edinburgh Fringe to perform his first one-man stage show. But he already has three million fans.

It might seem an odd progression, but Jon is one of a generation of "YouTubers". He makes videos at home, and uploads them to the internet.
Unlike many YouTubers, he's a professional. He earns a living from advertising revenue on his YouTube channel, and from selling his music on iTunes.
He's also got an international fan base. During his run at the Fringe, he hit three million subscribers - people who are notified when Jon uploads a new video.
He's one of a new generation of performers who use YouTube to perform from the comfort of their bedrooms.
In recent years, some YouTubers have made their way to the Fringe, hoping to develop their acts and broaden their appeal. In Jon's case, a producer reached out to him and booked him for the festival.
But how easy is it to translate views and subscribers into a successful live stage show?
"It's an arts festival," says Jon. "So you're competing with people who aren't on YouTube, who don't have audiences. They put a lot more effort into creating something that's really interesting.
"So to compete on their level you really have to think about what your show is, how do you appeal to people who aren't YouTubers, who don't care about YouTube videos or how many subscribers you have."
Jon spends several months putting together his one-man homemade a capella videos. He describes himself as "every level of production on my own YouTube channel".
In his show, he performs all his most-viewed classics, with a background of screens which nod to their online origins. He also sings some songs which haven't made their way onto the internet (yet) - and he tells the audience how his YouTube success came about, in between musical interludes.
And his brand of musical parody seems to be chiming with Fringe-goers. "I don't remember the last show we had under 100 people, so we fill up the venue really well," Jon says.
He'd been expecting lots of younger girls - his YouTube demographic - but says the audiences are "from all different walks of life."
Mawaan Rizwan, who won a competition to be YouTube's "next comic", has also had to think about how to move his YouTube videos onto a Fringe stage. But his videos are different to Jon's - for one thing, they involve him leaving his bedroom.
One example is "Twerking In Paris". For those unaware of the term, the dictionary definition of "twerk" is "to dance to popular music in a sexually provocative manner involving thrusting hip movements and a low, squatting stance".
In the video, which has nearly 60,000 views, Mawaan twerks on strangers: on the Paris metro, in the street, outside a cafe. It's a spin-off from "Twerking In Public" - which has 252,669 views and counting.
Mawaan says aspects of his comedy have helped him make the transition to the Fringe. "A lot of my videos involve the public, and people who are not expecting to be on cameraâ€¦ it's interesting, it's transferred into stuff I need for Edinburgh.
"You're going up to people, you're flyering them, you're doing stunts to get people into your show. It's really hard to stand out... so you need to be creative with what you do to promote yourself."
His efforts seem to be paying off. "Not only are the YouTube following telling their friends, but it's accumulating into a bigger live following."
But the transition from YouTube success to a run at the Fringe has not been without its challenges.
"It's scary going from recording a video in your bedroom to being in front of thousands of people and trying to sell a show every night for 30 days," he says.
"That was quite a big transition for me, because on the internet you can be anyone - you can play a character, you can accentuate certain parts of your personalityâ€¦ and people won't know otherwise because you can edit everything."
Playing a character is something this next YouTuber takes very seriously.
Puddles the clown fronts Puddles Pity Party, a cabaret comedy act. He's performed live for many years, but has recently appeared in a collection of viral videos on YouTube - including one where he covers Lorde's "Royals" in his signature velvety baritone voice.
Puddles isn't just a YouTube fixture. He stays in character whenever he's in public - which means he communicates in mime... Even during interviews.
It might make answering journalists' questions a challenge. But Puddles has no difficulty marketing himself to potential fans - gamboling around the Assembly Gardens tweeting selfies with strangers (and the BBC team).
He may be a clown who doesn't talk, but Puddles manages to epitomise modern-day communication.
