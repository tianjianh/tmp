The quake caused a giant wave out at sea, called a tsunami, which grew to 10 metres high.
Half an hour after the quake, the tsunami hit the North East coast of Japan, destroying everything in its path.
Many homes, schools and businesses were swept away by the massive wave.
Leah visited Japan to find out more about how people's lives were changed by the devastating natural disaster.
