[SN]TITLE[SN]
Wycombe Wanderers 1-1 Accrington Stanley

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Adebayo Akinfenwa scored his first Wycombe goal as they battled hard to earn a 1-1 draw with Accrington.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The former AFC Wimbledon striker opened his account in just the fourth minute with a well-timed header from a Joe Jacobson free-kick to set the tone.
Wycombe looked the stronger of the two sides throughout the first half, creating a number of chances, but failed to add to their tally and they were to pay for their wastefulness.
The visitors started like an express train after the break, with Sean McConville firing home the equaliser just minutes after the restart.
Both sides fought valiantly in the second half, showing both attacking flair and defensive solidity.
The best chance to win it fell to Sam Wood, who slammed a 30-yard volley against the crossbar with Stanley keeper Aaron Chapman beaten.
The game closed with multiple chances for both teams but the goalkeepers were found to be in excellent form and were instrumental in keeping the scoreline down.
