Pensioners found on 'suckers list'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Nearly 200,000 people - with an average age of 74 - have been seen on so-called "suckers lists" circulated by fraudsters.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The potential victims have been identified by trading standards teams investigating fraudulent mail.
Some 10,843 of them have lost money already, being tricked out of an average of Â£1,184 each.
Suckers lists are drawn up by con-artists who find people who have been caught out by a con.
They also include those who have the potential to be caught out. The lists are sold between fraudsters.
Trading standards teams are urging people to look out for relatives or neighbours who may be vulnerable to mass marketing scams.
The National Trading Standards Scams Team estimates that it has saved consumers more than Â£5m  over the last three years by tackling the issue.
