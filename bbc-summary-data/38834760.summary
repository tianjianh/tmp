Six Nations 2017: Scotland's Ryan Wilson targets 'minimum three wins'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Scotland back-rower Ryan Wilson says three Six Nations wins are a minimum requirement if Vern Cotter's squad are to maintain their recent progress.

The Scots have not won three games in the championship since 2006.
They face Ireland, Wales and Italy at home, with away matches against France and England, and Wilson believes they can even challenge for the title.
"Three wins would be the minimum target this year I'd say, but we're looking to go out and win every game," he said.
"Can we make a title push? Yeah, definitely.
"We're in a really good place but you think that at the start of every Six Nations.
"This time we have got some real depth in positions all across the park, especially in the centres and back row.
"It is harder than ever to get a place in this team now and I think that's what makes us a better team. Competition can only be good for individuals and we've got that."

Wilson, 27, is set to be handed his 24th cap when Cotter confirms his side  on Thursday to face Ireland in Saturday's opener at Murrayfield.
Having re-established himself at number eight since returning to the team mid-way through last year's Championship, the Glasgow back-rower could feature on the flank if Cotter decides to match Ireland's abrasive back row with similar bulk.
Scotland have not won on the opening weekend of the Six Nations since beating France in 2006. They have lost their last four Tests against Ireland, and only won three of their 17 meetings in the Six Nations.
The Irish will be without key fly-half Johnny Sexton and flanker Peter O'Mahony, but Wilson says expectations are high regardless.
"Sexton is a key man for them and a lot of people are going to have raised expectations now that he's not playing," he added.
"But we're just going to focus on our job. I wouldn't say it has given us an extra lift because we have only thought about ourselves this week.
"I'm sure someone like Paddy Jackson will step in. He's a brilliant player and does that job for Ulster anyway.
"It's the same with O'Mahony. They have brilliant depth in their back row with guys like CJ Stander, Jamie Heaslip and Josh van der Flier.
"We'd hope the expectations will be high in our country anyway because we're in a good place right now and we want to go out and win."
