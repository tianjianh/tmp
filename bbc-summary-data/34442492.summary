Jersey car parks to get new cashless payment system

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A new cashless payment system will be introduced into Jersey car parks under new plans by the States.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Currently scratch cards and display discs are used, but Transport Minister Deputy Eddie Noel advertised for a new app-based cashless system.
He said this would eventually be rolled out to street parking as well as the island's 46 car parks.
It would run alongside the scratch cards so people without a smart phone could still pay to park.
The price of a scratch card is 76p per unit with a monthly season ticket costing Â£123.31, and Mr Noel said the new system would cost the same as scratch cards.
Mr Noel said it would give people a greater flexibility and make it easier to police as it would be likely to use number plate recognition. It should be in place by the middle of 2016.
