Fellow Scots Steph Twell and Josephine Moultrie are also through to the 3000m final.
Lynsey Sharp races in the 800m heats on Saturday evening.
"We've done a lot of work and I'll be ready for the final with one day's rest," said O'Hare.
"I needed to work on my positioning because you don't get to race a field like that every day.
"I wanted to make sure that I got my tactics right. Coming down the home straight I was well within myself, it felt good, it felt smooth, so we have a day off tomorrow, and I'm happy with today."
The US-based runner from West Linton ran his heat in three minutes, 41.09 seconds, five-hundredths of a second slower than fastest qualifier Ayanleh Souleiman of Djibouti.
