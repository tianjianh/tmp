The 22-year-old was playing American Donald Young in the first round when he slipped and fell at the baseline.
After courtside treatment to his hip, Kyrgios continued until the tie-break but retired after Young took it 7-3.
Kyrgios withdrew from recent events in Monte Carlo and Rome with a hip injury.
"It just was a sharp pain when I fell," said the world number 20.
"I started feeling it when I was walking, when I was landing on my serve. It's exactly what I was feeling in Paris. I mean, it's tough to play through."
He added: "I felt pretty much everything I was feeling a month ago. It's not great at the moment. But we'll see."
Asked about his chances of recovering in time for Wimbledon, which gets under way on 3 July, Kyrgios said: "I'd play Wimbledon if I was injured pretty bad anyway.
"I'm here anyway. I don't really have time to go home or anything. Yeah, I will be playing, for sure."
And the Australian joked that the enforced lay-off meant he might spend the coming days at a pub in Wimbledon village.
"Dog & Fox," he replied, when asked for his immediate plans.
Kyrgios beat Rafael Nadal on his way to the Wimbledon quarter-finals three years ago, and lost to eventual champion Andy Murray in the fourth round last year.
"This is a big tournament but I think when you've got Wimbledon, or any of the Grand Slams, looming, you don't hang in there," former Davis Cup captain John Lloyd told BBC Sport.
"With Wimbledon coming, you can't take any chances."
