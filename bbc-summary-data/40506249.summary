The latest fighting is reported to be in Boni forest, which straddles the border with Somalia.
Three police officers are confirmed dead and one seriously injured, according to a statement released by the Kenyan police.
Al-Shabab has claimed responsibility.
The Daily Nation newspaper reports that some 200 attackers were involved in the fighting.
It quotes a local official as saying that an unknown number of villagers are also missing.
