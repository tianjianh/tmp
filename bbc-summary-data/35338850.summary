South Africa's Haydn Porteous won his first European Tour event after a bogey-free three-under-par final round of 69 saw him claim the Joburg Open.

The 21-year-old triumphed by two shots on 18 under from compatriot Zander Lombard (71) with both securing a place at July's Open at Royal Troon.
Porteous hit every green in regulation, birdieing the eighth, 14th and 18th.
Londoner Anthony Wall, the highest-ranked of four players tied for third, also booked his Open spot with a 72.
Wall had two bogeys and two birdies in his opening 10 holes before closing with eight successive pars to finish on 15 under.
With the top three in South Africa guaranteed a place at The Open, the 40 year old qualified ahead of Sweden's Bjork Akesson, American Daniel Im and home hope Justin Walters.
Porteous had missed the cut at his two previous European Tour events this season but he became the second first-time winner in consecutive weeks after Brandon Stone, 22, won the South African Open last Sunday.
"I have been lucky," said 40-year-old Anthony Wall after earning a place at the Open Championship for the second year in a row - but only the seventh time of his career, and his first appearance at Royal Troon.
"I was second last year and got a spot right on the nail, and this year the same. It's been a truly wonderful week.
"I get to play in the greatest event in the world again. It's the greatest honour a golfer can have. It's the greatest place to play golf."
The Joburg Open was the third event in the Open Qualifying Series for Royal Troon.
Three Aussies, Matthew Jones, Rod Pampling and Nick Cullen, booked their places at the Australian Open in November, while victor Jamie Donaldson, England's Lee Westwood, Frenchman Clement Sordet and Thai Phachara Khongwatmai claimed the four qualifying places on offer at the Thailand Golf Championship.
