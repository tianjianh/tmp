Scots must stand united in the aftermath of the independence referendum, the Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland has said.

The Rt Rev John Chalmers led calls for supporters of independence and the Union alike to pull together.
Scottish voters rejected independence by a margin of 55% to 45%.
Political leaders including Alex Salmond have also called for unity in the aftermath of the result.
"Today I particularly care about those who feel as though they are on the wrong side of this outcome," said Mr Chalmers.
"I expect those on the winning side to go out of their way to avoid triumphalism and to be inclusive in their plans for Scotland's future, and to take the time to assure those who are anxious, disappointed and down that they understand how they must feel.
"Today we must stop thinking in terms of 'them' and 'us' - only us."
During his admission of defeat in the independence campaign, Mr Salmond called on all to follow him in "accepting the democratic verdict of the people of Scotland".
A host of other politicians and celebrities have also called for the people of Scotland to come together after a divisive campaign.
Deputy First Minister Nicola Sturgeon joined Mr Salmond in saying Scots should "move forward together".
Scottish secretary Alistair Carmichael said it was time to "work together as one country, across the whole political spectrum, making life better for the people who live and work here", while Scottish Labour leader Johann Lamont said supporters of the Union should "not be triumphalist".
And comedy writer Armando Iannucci urged Scots to be proud of themselves for turning out to vote in record numbers, with his Twitter message on the subject shared hundreds of times.
He wrote: "84.6%. One way to unite today would be for every Scot to wear that number as a badge of pride. An extraordinary turnout."
Police Scotland praised the public's behaviour after only six arrests were made on polling day.
Assistant Chief Constable Bernard Higgins thanked the public for their help and cooperation throughout the campaign and the day of the ballot.
"It is to everyone's credit that they remained calm on a day of potentially high emotion and co-operated fully with our officers and the staff at polling places on a day when record numbers turned out to vote," he said.
"The ballot and count passed off smoothly and there were just a very few isolated incidents across the country involving a small number of alleged offences."
The six arrests were mainly for alleged breaches of the peace and assaults.
