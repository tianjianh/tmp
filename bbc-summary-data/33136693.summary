[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Cambridge United supporter Simon Dobbin, 42, was assaulted outside a pub in Southend, Essex, in March.
He is now conscious but remains in a serious but stable condition in hospital, Essex Police said.
Four men from Essex were arrested on suspicion of violent disorder and grievous bodily harm, bringing the total number of men arrested to eight.
A 38-year-old from Basildon, two Southend men aged 32 and 20, and a 24-year-old from Rochford have been released on bail until August.
Det Ch Insp Martin Pasmore said Mr Dobbin, from Suffolk, had been left with "life-changing injuries" as a result of the attack.
Mr Dobbin had been on his way home from the Southend United v Cambridge United match on 21 March when he was attacked outside The Railway pub in East Street.
He was taken to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge where he was put into a medically-induced coma.
Appealing for witnesses, Det Ch Insp Pasmore said: "He was an entirely innocent victim who was simply enjoying a day out with a friend."
