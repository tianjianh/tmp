[SN]TITLE[SN]
Under curfew high-risk rapist John McDougall back in jail

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A high-risk rapist who was given a 10-year overnight home curfew order at the request of police has been jailed for breaching it within 48 hours.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The restriction of liberty order also banned John McDougall from contact with females under 18 and from approaching any unaccompanied adult female.
At Kilmarnock Sheriff Court, the 36-year-old admitted buying cigarettes and alcohol for teenagers.
McDougall, who is from Irvine, was jailed for 15 months.
In 2000, McDougall, was jailed for 10 years for raping a 19-year-old woman at knifepoint in Irvine.
Two days after his release in 2005, again in Irvine, he tried to drag a vulnerable 16-year-old girl into bushes.
He was jailed for one year for that offence.
In 2012, it emerged McDougall had contacted 55 women using a bogus Facebook account in prison and had set up a meeting with a woman while on parole.
Last year, he bought an internet-enabled mobile phone - despite an interim sexual offences prevention order to prevent this being granted the day before.
Within 24 hours, he had created a Facebook page stating he was "looking for females".
Police who found the phone hidden behind a radiator at his home discovered he had visited dating sites repeatedly.
Officers also found written notes with the names and addresses of women.
McDougall was jailed for 14 months for that offence.
