The series, which originally ran from 2000-07, sees cast members Lauren Graham and Alexis Bledel reunited in the mother-daughter comedy drama.
It also features the return of original cast members Melissa McCarthy and Scott Patterson.
Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life will feature four 90-minute episodes, each covering a season of the year.
A trailer offering a first look at the new series attracted almost one million views on YouTube in its first 24 hours online.
Speaking at a press conference promoting the show, Graham said the entire cast easily fell back into working together again.
"Everything was like, 'Oh, here's the chemistry we had from the very first day we met,' and it was just a joy to revisit," she said.
The cast also revealed what fans can expect from the new series, which sees Rory return to her mother in the fictional town of Stars Hollow from her new life in London.
Bledel teased "people's questions will be answered" when questioned about her character Rory's love life.
The episodes will also deal with the death of Lorelai's father, Richard, following the death in 2014 of actor Edward Herrmann who played the role.
Show creator Amy Sherman-Palladino, who has also returned to write the new episodes, said she would have preferred them to have been released gradually, rather than all in one go on the streaming platform.
She suggested those inclined to spoil the ending for others get "some therapy" beforehand.
