Police said the fire in the Drumcor Road area was reported at about 20:15 BST on Saturday evening.
They said investigations were ongoing "to establish if the fire was started deliberately or not".
They said the incident is being linked to a suspicious object which was found in the Clabby Road area on Friday.
This turned out to be harmless.
Police said they would be increasing patrols in the area to "ensure the protection of the public".
It is understood the fire was in a shed on land owned by relatives of a family named in a BBC Scotland documentary earlier this week into dog breeding.
