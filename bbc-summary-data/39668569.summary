Freda Boyd, 51, from Drumeen Drive in Garvagh, is accused of ill-treating four different people while they were in-patients for mental health disorders at Garvagh Care Home on 22 March 2014.
A solicitor said she would be contesting the four charges.
Ms Boyd did not attend Coleraine Magistrates Court on Friday and the pleas were entered by her solicitor.
The case was adjourned for two weeks.
"This is a very serious matter. This is not something I'm going to deal with in her absence," a judge told the court
Ms Boyd's solicitor said there were questions to be answered as to why it had taken so long to prosecute her.
