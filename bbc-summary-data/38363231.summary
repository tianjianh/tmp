Newcastle University student Ed Farmer, from Leicestershire, was taken to hospital in a life-threatening condition on Tuesday last week.
The 20-year-old, who was studying economics, died in the city's Royal Victoria Infirmary the following day.
Friends posted tributes on social media sites, saying he lit up their lives with his "constant jokes and laughter".
Mr Farmer had reportedly been participating in an Agricultural Society event.
Northumbria Police said he had been drinking heavily.
Jonny Hedley posted a photo of his friend on Facebook and wrote: "RIP brother, been an absolute pleasure knowing you."
Another friend, Barney Carr, wrote on Facebook: "Gone too soon lad. You lit up all our lives, we'll miss you down here. RIP you legend."
The university said it was "deeply saddened" by the death of Mr Farmer, who had shown "great academic promise".
It added it took a "hard line" on behaviour that might constitute a risk and a full investigation would be carried out and "appropriate action" taken.
Northumbria Police said the investigation into the death of Mr Farmer, who is thought to have attended independent Oakham School, had now been passed to the coroner.
