[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Lancashire had the better of the first day at Southport after bowling out Middlesex for 180.

Jordan Clark and Saqib Mahmood each took three wickets, backed by two each for Tom Bailey and Ryan McLaren as the hosts were bowled out in 51 overs.
Tim Murtagh struck twice in the first over of Lancashire's reply, having Alex Davies and Liam Livingstone caught behind in successive balls.
But Shiv Chjanderpaul (32*) saw Lancashire to the close on 123-4.
He has so far put on 49 with South African Kolpak player Dane Vilas, who is on 24, for the fifth wicket.
Skipper Steven Croft also played his part, coming in on a hat-trick with the score on 0-2 before putting on 50 with England Test opener Haseeb Hameed.
After his recent run of low scores, Hameed showed signs of a return to form before becoming wicketkeeper John Simpson's third victim for 18.
That added to Simpson's efforts with the bat earlier, having made an unbeaten 53, chiefly in a stand of 71 with Paul Stirling (49).
Prior to his second-ball duck, Lancashire wicketkeeper Davies had earlier taken six catches - one short of the county's first-class record, held jointly by Bill Farrimond (v Kent, Old Trafford, 1930), Warren Hegg (v Derbyshire, Chesterfield, 1989) and Luke Sutton (v Yorkshire, Headingley, 2008).
Saqib Mahmood told BBC Radio Lancashire:
"To bowl them out for 180 was a fantastic effort. I feel like I'm learning with every spell and every ball that I'm bowling that I'm picking something up.
"There's been a lot of soft dismissals. I don't think it's as bad a pitch as the score suggests. We stuck at our areas quite well. It's a pitch where you get rewarded for digging in.
"It's been a good rebuilding phase from us. The ball is getting older and we've got a right and left hand combination in Shiv Chanderpaul and Dane Vilas."
Middlesex's Tim Murtagh told BBC Radio London:
"We needed a good start with the ball because obviously it's not ideal being skittled for 180. I'd say you'd rather be in Lancashire's shoes but there's plenty in the wicket.
"It's going to spin as the game goes on. We wanted to set a competitive score. We have given ourselves half a sniff by taking a few wickets tonight.
"It's one of those pitches where things can happen quite quickly. Someone can look reasonably comfortable and then get a good ball from nowhere and you can knock another over quite quickly. It's a nice wicket to bowl on especially with the newer ball."
