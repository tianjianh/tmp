[SN]TITLE[SN]
Strabane arrests: Three men remanded after funeral arrests

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Three men arrested after the funeral of a dissident republican have been remanded in custody charged with wearing paramilitary-style clothing.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
They were arrested after the funeral of Michael Barr in County Tyrone on Thursday.
He was shot dead in the Sunset House pub in Dublin on 25 April.
They are jointly charged with wearing clothing or having articles as members or supporters of a proscribed organisation.
Conor David Metcalfe, 25, of Monasteoy Park in Dublin, John Desmond Christie, 52, of Ratoath, Patrick Lavin, 51, of Deansrath were refused bail at Omagh Magistrates' Court.
Police have released 12 other men, who were also arrested, pending a report to the Public Prosecution Service.
The 15 men were being questioned about alleged membership of the dissident republican group, widely referred to as the new IRA.
The court was told that the three men were among a number of people who flanked the coffin of Mr Barr as it was taken from his father's home in Clady, County Tyrone.
A police constable said that they were objecting to bail because of tensions  in areas of Strabane and Londonderry and also due to the risk of them failing to appear for any future court hearings.
However, defence solicitors for the three said that they were intending to travel to future court appearances and said cash sureties had been deposited.
