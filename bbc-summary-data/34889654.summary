The Briton, 28, is undefeated since April 2013, but he is still cautious.
"Although I have a very strong record over the last couple of years, it wouldn't take much for that record to disappear," Scott told BBC Sport.
He claimed gold at the Finn World Championships in 2014 and 2011.
The Weymouth-based sailor has already secured his place on Team GB for next year's Rio Olympics.
"The reason for us being selected so early is so that we can focus on Rio," Scott said. "Everything that leads up to that is just a step along the way."
Scott narrowly missed out on a place at London 2012 to Sir Ben Ainslie, who went on to take his fourth Olympic gold.
"It was incredible frustrating," he told BBC Sport, "but if I hadn't gone through that I certainly wouldn't be as good a sailor as I am now."
Joining Scott in the British Sailing Team for the Finn Gold Cup will be Ben Cornish, James Hadden and 2010 Finn world champion Ed Wright.
