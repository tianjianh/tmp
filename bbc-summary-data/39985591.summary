New jobs to be created at Fenton ceramics firm

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A ceramics firm has opened a new Â£3m headquarters in Stoke-on-Trent, with plans to create about 25 new jobs.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Valentine Clays produces raw materials for the ceramics industry, supplying local firms as well as others across the world.
The latest investment includes a workshop, gallery and training space at the new base in Fenton.
Production is also set to move to the site in the next five years with two factories planned.
Local business leaders said the ceramics sector had enjoyed a resurgence in recent years and they are keen to show young people it was no longer the "dirty environment" it used to be, but a "high-tech, modern" industry.
