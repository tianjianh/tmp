[SN]TITLE[SN]
Chris Giwa's club expelled from Nigerian league

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Giwa FC have been expelled from Nigeria's top division for failing to honour fixtures.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The club is owned by businessman Chris Giwa, who is involved in a power struggle with the Nigerian Football Federation having declared himself its elected president.
The League Management Company (LMC), which runs the Nigeria Premier League said the club had failed to play three consecutive matches "without acceptable reason".
The club had been forced to play home games at a neutral venue in the southwestern city of Ilorin after recent crowd trouble in Jos against Enugu Rangers that forced the game to be abandoned.
Giwa has since August 2014 insisted he was elected president of the NFF in a disputed vote that saw Fifa threaten to ban the country from international competition. He has taken the NFF to court challenge their legitimacy.
Last week the NFF banned him and several of his supporters for five years for impersonation and taking football matters to a civil court, in breach of Fifa regulations.
