[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man has been arrested on suspicion of murder following the death of a Cambridge man who was attacked twice within half an hour.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Jeff Henry, 39, was left in a critical condition on 6 June and died at Addenbrooke's Hospital on Friday.
Cambridgeshire Police said a 36-year-old man from County Galway had been arrested at Holy Head Port, Anglesey.
He is currently being held on suspicion of murder at Parkside Police Station in Cambridge.
Police are continuing to appeal for witnesses.
A police spokesman said Mr Henry, of Cambridge, was seen running away from two men along Campkin Road in the direction of Arbury Road just moments before the attack.
Detectives believe he was subject to two assaults that night, one at about 00:45 BST and another about 25 minutes beforehand.
It is thought Mr Henry might have attended the Strawberry Fair before the attacks.
Det Insp Alan Page said: "Jeff was a relatively young man with plenty of his life left to live and enjoy. He is a well-known local man who was subjected to a sustained and brutal attack.
"I believe members of the local community will have information concerning why Jeff was attacked and I would urge them to come forward."
His purple bicycle, spectacles and mobile telephone have not been traced, police say.
