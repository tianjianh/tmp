[SN]TITLE[SN]
Bournemouth father denies giving baby fatal head injury

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man accused of murdering his baby son, who died after being "thrown or swung into something hard", did nothing to hurt him, a court heard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Robert Hinz, of Bournemouth, said he tried to help three-month-old Julian, who had suffered fatal head injuries.
The baby died at Southampton General Hospital on 9 April 2016, Winchester Crown Court heard.
Mr Hinz, 34, of Carysfort Road, denies murder and three counts of causing grievous bodily harm with intent.
The court has heard the pair were alone together at home while Julian's mother Monica was out shopping.
Julian was later found with severe skull fractures and died in hospital the following day.
He was killed in "a few moments of anger and violence" when he was "thrown or swung into something hard", prosecutors have told Mr Hinz's trial.
Taking the stand, Mr Hinz said:  "I do not remember what happened in the bedroom but I didn't murder my son.
"He wasn't breathing when I picked him up, he was floppy.
"I started to do resuscitation, blowing in his mouth, pressing on his chest."
Mr Hinz denied he often lost his temper but admitted he had damaged his flat when the paramedics arrived.
He said: "I took out my frustration on the door and the wall".
The jury previously heard Julian had also sustained fractured ribs on previous occasions, which the prosecution said would have been caused by "squeezing".
The trial continues.
