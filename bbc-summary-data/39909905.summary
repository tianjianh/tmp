[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The cyber-attack that disrupted computers in most of Scotland's health boards on Friday has been isolated, the Scottish government has said.

Health Secretary Shona Robison said there was no evidence that patient data had been compromised.
Most NHS computers are expected to be operational by Monday, the minister added.
Other public bodies are checking their systems over the weekend as a precaution.
The Scottish government said in many NHS areas the number of computers affected was in single figures.
The worst hit health board appears to have been NHS Lanarkshire where the ransomware attack disrupted hospital computer systems.
BBC Scotland understands that at Hairmyres Hospital in East Kilbride doctors had to rely on pen, paper and mobile phones as they treated patients.
First minister Nicola Sturgeon and the Scottish health secretary have been kept updated on developments.
Scottish Justice Secretary Michael Matheson joined a session the UK government's Cobra emergency committee on Saturday afternoon.
The ransomware attack hit a range of organisations in at least 99 countries.
Ms Robison said: "This has been a global cyber-attack which has impacted on countries across the world and clearly any incident of this nature is hugely concerning - but it's important to stress that there is no evidence to suggest patient data has been compromised.
"This week's incident emphasises the importance for all of us - the public and private sectors as well as the general public - to have the appropriate measures in place to protect against these kinds of attack.
"We have taken all necessary steps to ensure the cause and nature of this attack is identified and have managed to isolate the issues within the NHS in Scotland.
"Boards are currently working on protecting and restoring those systems where possible, with a view to getting most operational by Monday."
The ransomware used in the attack is called WannaCry and attacks Windows operating systems.
It encrypts files on a user's computer, blocking them from view, before demanding money, via an on-screen message, to access them again.
The virus is usually covertly installed on to computers by hiding within emails containing links, which users are tricked into opening.
