Michael Casey was handed a six-year term after he admitted causing the deaths of Stacey Burrows, 16, and Lucy Pygott, 17, by dangerous driving.
He was over the alcohol limit and speeding at the time, a court heard.
The Attorney General's Office said the sentence was issued in accordance with legal guidelines.
A spokesman confirmed the attorney general had received a request to review Casey's prison term, but decided not to send it to the Court of Appeal.
Explaining the decision, Solicitor General Robert Buckland said he "did not believe the sentence would be increased" if it was reviewed.
Stacey and Lucy were killed while on a training run in Aldershot, Hampshire, on 8 November.
During Casey's sentencing at Winchester Crown Court, a judge said he would be eligible for release after three years.
As the sentence was announced, Stacey's mother shouted from the public gallery: "I do not get my daughter back in three years, do I?".
The girls, who were members of Aldershot, Farnham and District Athletic Club, were warming up for an evening run when they were hit by Casey's Ford Focus in Queen's Avenue.
Lucy, who was from Hartley Wintney, Hampshire, had won a 3,000m bronze medal at the European Youth Championships in July.
Stacey, from Farnborough, was the Hampshire under-17 3,000m champion.
Casey, who pleaded guilty to two counts of causing death by dangerous driving, was also disqualified from driving for 10 years.
