Pantycelyn Hall protest: Deal seals future of homes

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A deal to safeguard the future of a Welsh language hall of residence at Aberystwyth University has been struck.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Accommodation at Pantycelyn will close at the end of this academic term to make it "fit for purpose" within four years.
The university's council ratified the deal at a meeting on Monday.
Once that was sealed, campaigners who have staged a sit-in protest against the plan since 14 June left.
They had raised concerns no timetable has been provided for reopening the Welsh medium hall of residence.
On Friday, a compromise was brokered between the university's chancellor, Sir Emyr Jones Parry, members of the Welsh Students Union at Aberystwyth (UMCA).
The university's council voted on Monday afternoon on a proposal by Sir Emyr to reopen Pantycelyn within four years after an extensive renovation project.
Welsh language students will be housed at Fferm Penglais and Penbryn Hall while the work is completed, under the new plan.
