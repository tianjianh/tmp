Tamim Iqbal batted through the Tigers' innings, hitting three sixes in his unbeaten 83 from 58 balls, but lacked any meaningful support as they posted 153-7 from their 20 overs.
Opener Stephan Myburgh and captain Peter Borren both made 29, but the Dutch left themselves too much to do.
Tight bowling at the death left them tantalisingly short on 145-7.
Captain Mashrafe Mortaza was Bangladesh's hero with the ball as his four overs cost only 14 runs, just when the Dutch were looking to press the accelerator.
