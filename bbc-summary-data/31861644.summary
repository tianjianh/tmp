BBC Wales understands that assembly officials were approached by the makers of Spectre, which stars Daniel Craig as 007, in late 2014.
But the request to film Bond in the Senedd's debating chamber was turned down.
The assembly said the chamber "is not a drama studio".
The Bond production team turned down its offer of using other locations within the assembly's estate.
Filming has already begun on Spectre, the 24th James Bond film, which is due to be shown in cinemas in November.
Sony Pictures has been asked to comment.
The assembly statement said: "The Senedd's Siambr [chamber] is the home of Welsh democracy and seat of government for Wales.
"Some media activity is allowed in the Siambr when it relates to the work of the assembly or reflects the Siambr's status as the focal point of Welsh civic life.
"It is not a drama studio.
"Decisions on requests from the creative industries to use the assembly's estate are made on a case by case basis, and we are proud to have collaborated with many television and film companies on drama productions such as Sherlock and Dr Who.
"The request by James Bond to use the Siambr was turned down and they were offered alternative locations on the estate which they subsequently declined."
