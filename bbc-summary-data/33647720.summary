The head of the Republic of Ireland's police has defended the appointment of her husband to a criminal investigation into alleged police leaks to journalists.

Noirín O'Sullivan said it was "a matter of public record" that her husband Jim McGowan was a detective superintendent.
"Any role that he carries out in (Irish police service) An Garda Síochána is in that capacity," she said.
She rejected any suggestion that journalists' phones were monitored.
A Garda superintendent has been questioned as part of the investigation into how the media learned that two Roma children had been taken from their parents amid concerns they had been abducted.
The children were later returned to their families.
The investigation began last year following a report by the former children's ombudsman Emily Logan.
It was reported in May that the officer was the most senior Garda officer ever to have been arrested as part of a criminal investigation.
