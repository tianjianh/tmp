Scotland belief in reaching cricket's top tier

Cricket Scotland chief executive Malcolm Cannon says it is "achievable" to eventually gain full International Cricket Council (ICC) membership.

Reaching that status would open the door for more regular contests against the likes of England and Australia.
"I won't give a timescale, but I'll give a lot of hope," said Cannon.
"I would put Scotland at the vanguard of these opportunities just now, so I'm not promising anything - but I do think it is possibly on the cards."
Cannon, who has been in his post since September 2015 after replacing Roddy Smith, explained how his fresh hopes came from talks at an ICC conference that Cricket Scotland hosted in June.
"From the whispers, this was the most positive and encouraging noises that have been heard from the ICC about potential full membership and potential Test cricket or multi-day cricket for minor nations," Cannon told BBC Scotland.
Cricket Scotland's more reachable target is to have their senior men's and women's teams in the top 12 of the ICC one-day international rankings by 2019.
Scotland are currently 13th ahead of play being abandoned because of rain in the first of a two-match ODI series against Afghanistan at The Grange on Monday.
Head coach Grant Bradburn's side went into that contest off the back of winning their first match at a major global tournament in 21 attempts - when they defeated Hong Kong at the World T20 in March.
That milestone encouraged Cannon, but he is reluctant to rest on it.
"We mustn't lose sight of the fact that it's taken 21 times to do it," he said.
"We've still to cause a major upset on the world stage and I think we've got to keep on believing in ourselves and proving that we can compete with the best of them."
