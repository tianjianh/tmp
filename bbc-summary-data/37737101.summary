[SN]TITLE[SN]
Barnet 3-2 Hartlepool United

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Barnet mounted a sensational comeback at The Hive to beat 10-man Hartlepool and secure their first home win since August.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Pools took the lead in the 31st minute when Nathan Thomas' cross-shot from a short corner found its way into the far corner and doubled their lead in the 53rd minute when Padraig Amond converted a fine cross from Thomas on the left.
However, defender Liam Donnelly was sent off for tripping John Akinde when he was clean through and the Barnet striker got up to roll home a confident 68th-minute penalty - his fifth goal in four games.
Hartlepool suffered another blow when Thomas was taken off on a stretcher with a pulled groin muscle.
Barnet were level almost immediately when Luke Gambin's cross from the left drifted in at the back post in the 76th minute.
And the comeback was complete 11 minutes from time when substitute Shaun Batt scored his first goal for Barnet, who held on for the win through 10 minutes of time added on.
