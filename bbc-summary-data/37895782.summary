Photographer and street artist Philippe Echaroux has created a powerful series of images to highlight the issue of illegal logging and continuing deforestation of the Amazon rainforest.

Sources show a recent increase in this activity, despite efforts by the Brazilian government to curb it.
Working alongside the Paiter Surui people of western Brazil, Echaroux created these spectral images by projecting large scale portraits of the indigenous community on to foliage on its land.
Almir Narayamoga Surui, the chief of the indigenous community that currently numbers around 1,300 people, has been given the task of replanting and protecting part of the rainforest by the government.
"Since the beginning of this year, we are undergoing a total invasion of deforesters and miners of diamonds and gold," he says.
"Every day, 300 trucks leave our territory filled with wood, which represents 600 hectares of deforested forests. And it continues to increase, whilst according to the Constitution of Brazil, it is illegal to deforest an indigenous reservation.
"On the ground, the illegal loggers have heavy means, with caterpillar machines. We have found mercury and cyanide in three rivers of Surui territory because of the miners."
