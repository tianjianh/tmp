James Green: Hull Kingston Rovers prop ruled out for season

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Hull KR prop James Green has been ruled out for the rest of the season after having surgery on a shoulder injury.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 25-year-old, who has played 20 games for Rovers this term, dislocated his acromioclavicular (AC) joint in the 24-20 defeat by Leeds in July.
The injury comes as a blow for a Hull KR side looking to retain its Super League status though the Qualifiers.
Rovers, who finished second from bottom in Super League, host Batley in their Qualifiers opener on Sunday.
