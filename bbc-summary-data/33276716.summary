[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
About 3,500 homes will be added to Northstowe, near Cambridge, where work is already under way to build 1,500 new properties.
Two primary schools, a secondary school and a sports hall will also be created as part of the development.
Northstowe, the biggest new town since Milton Keynes, is being developed by the government and property developers.
Tim Wotherspoon from South Cambridgeshire District Council said securing approval for the latest phase was a "major milestone".
