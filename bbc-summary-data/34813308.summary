The Aurora Borealis occurs when a stream of charged particles escapes from the Sun and hits the Earth's atmosphere.  In the process it can knock out satellites and even power lines.
Scientists have linked together devices called magnetometers which are scattered around the Arctic Circle.
It means they can have a more detailed picture of what is happening inside the aurora and it's likely future impact on us.
