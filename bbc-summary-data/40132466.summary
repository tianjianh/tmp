Fisher joins following his departure from Inverness Caledonian Thistle, while Bigirimana makes the switch from Coventry City.
Their arrival coincides with the departure from Fir Park of assistant manager James McFadden.
The 34-year-old's contract has expired and manager Stephen Robinson has decided to change his backroom set-up.
"James and I have worked together over the last few months, but I feel something a bit different will be beneficial to the squad," said Robinson.
"It's a tough call because James is a top lad and he's done so much for the club.
"We both had a good, open and honest chat after the game at Inverness. James is at the start of his coaching pathway, still doing his badges and qualifications, and I have no doubt he will make a very good manager one day. We've left each other on good terms."
McFadden, who scored his 44th goal for the club at Inverness on the final day of the season, said he would "take the summer to weigh everything up".
In terms of the new arrivals, Fisher, 26, scored six goals in the final six games of the 2016-17 season but could not save ICT from relegation.
Burundi international Bigirimana, 23, was on loan at Rangers from Newcastle in 2015 but did not play a match.
Robinson said of Fisher: "He will add a bit of firepower to the side. There's a variation in his goals as well, so we've got ourselves a terrific first signing."
The 6ft 3in target man joined Caley Thistle in January 2016 only to suffer a season-ending injury after three outings as a substitute.
This term he managed a total of eight goals from 25 appearances.
Having played in the lower leagues of Spain, Belgium and Italy, he moved to Scotland from Torquay United.
Speaking to MFC TV, Fisher said: "It's fantastic, I spoke to the gaffer at the end of the season, had a good talk and I'm delighted to get this move over the line.
"It's a big club with a great fan base and good history, and when I spoke to the manager and he told me about his plans for this season I knew I wanted to be a part of it so it was an easy decision."
Bigirimana started his career at Coventry before being bought by Newcastle for a fee of between £500,000 and £1m in 2012. He was loaned back to Coventry before making a permanent switch to the club in the summer of 2016.
