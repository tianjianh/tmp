[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Police probing the unsolved murder of an Asian man 14 years ago have staged a reconstruction to try and jog the memories of potential witnesses.

Surjit Singh Chhokar was stabbed to death in Overtown, North Lanarkshire, on 4 November 1998.
The reconstruction on Monday night saw several models of cars from the 1990s placed on the streets of Overtown.
No-one was convicted of Mr Chhokar's murder, despite the arrests of three men and two subsequent trials.
Two inquiries were ordered in the aftermath of the failed prosecutions. One made allegations of "institutional racism".
Following the publication of the reports in 2001, the then Lord Advocate, Colin Boyd QC, said that the Chhokar family had been failed by the police and prosecution services.
Monday's reconstruction is part of a new investigation which Strathclyde Police was told to carry out following reform of Scotland's centuries-old double jeopardy law, which came into force at the end of last year.
This means that the men originally accused of the murder could face a retrial.
