A suspected World War Two bomb has been detonated in a controlled explosion more than 24 hours after it was first discovered on a building site.

The device was found by construction workers in Paradise Street, Coventry, at 15:00 BST on Monday.
Lorry loads of sandbags were delivered to the scene before the controlled blast by the Army's bomb disposal team between 22:00 and 23:00 BST on Tuesday.
Businesses and Coventry University's Technocentre were evacuated.
A wall of sandbags, which took the best part of a day to erect, was put in place to absorb the explosion, West Midlands Police said.
The force tweeted there was some "tidying up to do", but things were expected to return to normal on Wednesday.
Thomas Joyce, who runs an MOT centre on Paradise Street, said he had to "drop everything" and evacuate when he was told about the bomb.
"I thought probably midday or 2pm we would be open for business," he said.
"It's unfortunate but it's one of those things - you can't hold back a bomb."
Luke Stanmore, one of many students who had to leave their halls of residence, said they had been given several times about when they might be able to return.
"I asked a police officer if he knew how long after the explosion we would be allowed back in, but it's up to the [Army]."
