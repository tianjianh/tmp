The pensioner passed away on Sunday at Caledonian Court Care Home on Victoria Road, Larbert.
Police Scotland said the death was currently being treated as unexplained.
It is understood that a morphine overdose is a potential line of inquiry being pursued by police officers investigating the death.
A Police Scotland spokesman said: "Officers in Forth Valley are currently investigating the death of an 87-year-old woman, who died at a nursing home on Victoria Road, Larbert.
"The death is currently being treated as unexplained and inquiries are ongoing."
Caledonian Court Care Home is operated by Care UK.
The company's regional director, Liz McKeegan, said: "We would like to offer our sincere condolences to the family of the resident who passed away on Sunday.
"The lady concerned was receiving end of life care and this was being overseen by a very experienced, fully-qualified nurse.
"As we await the consideration of the procurator fiscal, it would not be appropriate for us to comment further."
