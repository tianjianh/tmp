What is the Tube strike row about?

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
As two further Tube strikes are announced by three of the four unions involved in a dispute with London Underground, what is it about?

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Transport for London (TfL), the local government body responsible for most of Greater London's travel network, plans to introduce a 24-hour Tube service on Fridays and Saturdays.
The launch of this new night time service was due to take place on 12 September, however the BBC understands this date will be pushed back while talks continue.
The new service will be run across the Jubilee, Victoria, most of the Central, Northern and Piccadilly lines.
The four unions involved in the dispute with London Underground (LU), a subsidiary of TFL, are the Rail, Maritime and Transport (RMT) union, the Associated Society of Locomotive Engineers and Firemen (Aslef) the Transport Salaried Staffs' Association (TSSA) and Unite.
The unions say the dispute with LU is about workers' pay and conditions associated with the new night Tube working.
RMT general secretary Mick Cash said workers would be forced to "wreck their home lives in order to comply with the 'rosters from hell' which have been drawn up to plug the staffing gaps in the Night Tube plans".
Job cuts and a lack of proper consultation are two further reasons for the the dispute, the unions have said.
They say they want workers to be fairly compensated for night working, and they have rejected a deal including a 2% average pay rise for all Tube employees, plus a Â£500 launch bonus for staff on Night Tube stations and lines.
It says a night time Tube service is needed to meet demand and it would boost London's night time economy.
LU says it has put forward an "extremely fair revised offer" and is hiring 137 more train operators to work on the night Tube. It says this means existing workers will be doing "a few extra nights per year within the existing working week".
No-one was being asked to work more hours than at present, it added.
The offer includes a pay increase in 2016-17 of RPI or 1%, whichever is greater, and a Â£500 bonus for station staff in February 2016 after the completion of ticket office closures and customer service modernisation plans.
Under TfL's latest offer, night drivers will also receive an extra Â£200 per night shift during a short transition period, after which they will have the choice whether or not to work night shifts.
Tube staff have so far held two strikes during the current dispute.
The first strike was held on 8 July, while a second 24-hour strike was held by four unions began on 6 August.
Both strikes caused the entire London Underground network to close.
On Tuesday two further 24-hour strikes were announced, due to take place on Tuesday 25 August and Thursday 27 August.
Station staff will strike from 18:30 each day and drivers from 21:00.
Since becoming mayor, Boris Johnson hasn't held talks with those who run London's transport unions, despite numerous strikes. The only time he talked to Bob Crow, the former leader of the RMT, was when Mr Crow called in to a radio show the mayor was on.
Critics say the mayor should play more of a role in building bridges, but the mayor says it is for his team at Transport for London to do the talking.
From the sidelines, the mayor has accused the unions of "playing politics" and, from the frontline, the unions have accused the mayor of - you guessed it - "playing politics".
He has called the offer made to tube workers "incredibly generous" and said he would not authorise any more money being added to it.
Under current rules all that is needed for a strike is a simple majority of those that take part in a ballot.
The government wants to impose a minimum 50% turnout - and public sector strikes would need the backing of at least 40% of those eligible to vote.
However, the proposals under the Trade Union Bill would not have prevented this action.
Aslef, for example, saw a 97% vote in favour of a strike on an 81% turnout.
