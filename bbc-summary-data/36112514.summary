[SN]TITLE[SN]
Pembrokeshire cemetery fees are expected to rise

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The cost of dying is expected to go up in Pembrokeshire as the local authority looks to "break even".

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Pembrokeshire council owns 11 cemeteries but says the current burial and memorial fees "contribute very little" to their ongoing maintenance.
A report to go before cabinet on 25 April says an extra £50,000 a year is needed to cover the council's costs.
It recommends increasing charges across a range of services from reserving a plot to digging a grave.
If the plans are agreed, the cost of excavating a new single grave will increase from £464 to £760, while the cost of burying cremated remains will go up from £151 to £160.
The cost of installing memorials are also recommended to rise.
