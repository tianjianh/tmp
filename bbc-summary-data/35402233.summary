Rhys Priestland: Wales star 'needs games' for Six Nations - Jenkins

Fly-half Rhys Priestland's lack of Bath matches is a worry for Wales before the Six Nations, says Neil Jenkins.

Priestland, 29, has been the understudy to England's George Ford at Bath since his move from Scarlets last summer.
"It's obviously an issue with Priest not being able to play a great deal of rugby," kicking coach Jenkins said.
Meanwhile, Jenkins expects Ireland to "do their utmost" to get fly-half Jonathan Sexton fit to face Wales in their opener in Dublin on 7 February.
Worries about 30-year-old Sexton's head injury after he came off in Leinster's Champions Cup defeat by Wasps on Saturday have eased.
Bath coach Mike Ford had announced that Priestland would be taking an 18-month sabbatical from Test rugby, but the player changed his mind as Wales' squad announcement approached and he is again challenging Ospreys' Dan Biggar for the stand-off role.
"He's a fantastic rugby player, we like the way he plays for us but his lack of game-time is a worry," said Jenkins.
Bath are at Saracens in the Aviva Premiership on Saturday and Jenkins added: "He might be one that needs game-time this weekend, but whether he gets the opportunity, who knows?"
"I've been up to see him a few times and he'd love to play a lot more than he is."
Wales head coach Warren Gatland will decide by midweek which Welsh-based players will be released back to their regions for Pro12 matches this weekend.
Captain Sam Warburton wants more action after making his comeback from an ankle injury for Cardiff Blues last Friday, while full-back Liam Williams has not played since the World Cup because of a foot injury.
Three-quarter Tyler Morgan, who was also injured during the World Cup, is close to a return.
