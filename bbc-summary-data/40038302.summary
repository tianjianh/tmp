[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The SNP and Labour have agreed a coalition to run Stirling Council as a majority administration.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The parties announced the decision at a meeting of the new council on Wednesday evening.
Christine Simpson (Labour) was named as the new provost, and Graham Houston (SNP) as depute convener.
At the start of the meeting, a minute's silence was held to remember the victims of the Manchester terror attack.
The previous administration in Stirling was a Labour-Conservative coalition.
Most of Scotland's 32 local authorities have now formed administrations, but a few are still to reach decisions.
It was announced earlier on Wednesday that the SNP would form a minority administration in East Dunbartonshire.
West Lothian and Edinburgh councils are due to hold meetings on Thursday, after both adjourned meetings last week.
