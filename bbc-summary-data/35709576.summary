[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man with severe mental health issues has been jailed for life for murdering a care worker who asked him to turn down his TV set.

Michael Meanza was living in care in a home in Acton, west London, when he bludgeoned a member of staff to death with a fire extinguisher in 2015.
Jenny Foote, 38, had interrupted the programme he was watching to make the request on behalf of another resident.
Meanza, 47, admitted manslaughter but was found guilty of murder.
He has been ordered to serve a minimum of 24 years in prison.
Sentencing him, Judge John Bevan QC told the Old Bailey any parole board would need to think "long and hard" before considering him for release as he posed an "ongoing danger."
Prosecutor Brian O'Neill QC told jurors even though Meanza had been the subject of a hospital order since the 1990s, he should not escape responsibility for his actions.
He said: "It cannot be right either as a matter of law or on the grounds of public policy that Michael Meanza - or any defendant - should be able to escape full responsibility for an unlawful killing on the basis he is too angry an individual to be guilty of murder."
When asked if he had any regrets, Meanza told the court he had some but they were too few to list.
The court was told Ms Foote discussed the noise level of his TV from the doorway of his room and then returned to her office.
Three hours later he killed her in a "ferocious and brutal attack", the court heard.
During a subsequent police interview Meanza described the TV incident as "the straw that broke the camel's back" and said care workers had meddled in his relationship with his girlfriend because of the ward section he was in.
"They said I can be with her and then after a while they pull us apart ... That would drive you bonkers. I snapped," Meanza told police.
The victim's brother Michael Foote earlier paid tribute to his "beautiful, very caring and very loving" sister.
He said lessons had to be learned, specifically that Meanza, who had 16 previous convictions, should perhaps have been in a more secure environment given the authorities were aware of his violent history.
Mr Foote said his sister only qualified as a care worker two months before she was killed by Meanza.
