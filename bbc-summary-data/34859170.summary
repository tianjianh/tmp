PC Richard Whitham, 36, was sentenced at Leeds Magistrates' Court after being found guilty of two counts of common assault.
The attacks occurred during an off duty incident in Sheffield on 22 February.
Whitham, of Woodfield Road, Sheffield, who worked at Moss Way Police Station in the city, was dismissed from the force following his conviction.
Det Supt Terry Mann, from the force's professional standards department, said: "South Yorkshire Police strives to ensure that those within our ranks who are suspected of wrongdoing are dealt with in exactly the same way as any other member of the public.
"This is vitally important if we are to restore public confidence in the service we provide."
