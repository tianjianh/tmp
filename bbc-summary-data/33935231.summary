Liz Kendall promised an "optimistic vision of a better Wales" if she wins, while in Cardiff.
In Wrexham, Andy Burnham said: "We want to see more devolution within the Labour party, it's been too London-centric for too long."
Fellow candidates Yvette Cooper and Jeremy Corbyn were in Wales last week.
Ms Kendall said: "I absolutely believe in getting as many powers as possible out of Westminster and down, not just to the Welsh assembly, but also to local communities.
"Wales knows best what skills, infrastructure and employment programmes, housing and transport is needed here.
"That's (a decision) not best made by Whitehall, it's best made by the people in Wales."
She told BBC Wales she would "stand shoulder-to-shoulder" with Welsh Labour.
"We need to regain trust on the economy, on issues like welfare and immigration, but also to have a positive, optimistic vision of a better Wales in the future and that's what I offer," she added.
Around 80 people attended a meeting where Mr Burnham took questions from party members in Wrexham.
He said the party had been "too out of touch with its grassroots", adding he wanted to see "more staff, more funding for the Welsh Labour party".
"More broadly when we look at the country, I've asked Carwyn Jones to co - chair a UK constitutional convention so that we get the final settlement right, a settlement that does give more power to all the nations of the UK but actually still holds us together as a United Kingdom,"  he said.
Mr Burnham added: "I put economic credibility at the heart of everything I've been doing".
He also said there is a risk of "disunity" and "Labour could go back to the days of division", saying "I will do whatever I can to hold the Labour Party together".
Ms Cooper met party members at Connah's Quay, Flintshire, on Friday, stressing the need to create more hi-tech jobs such as those at the nearby Airbus plant.
Mr Corbyn spent Monday and Tuesday in Wales, pressing his anti-austerity message and support for the NHS, ending with a rally in Cardiff which attracted about 1,000 supporters.
Ballot papers were sent on Friday to Labour party members, affiliated members and registered supporters.
The winner will be named on 12 September.
