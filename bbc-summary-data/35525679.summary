"We deserved to win the game. Our second half performance was strong. I knew it would be tough as they are in a similar position to ourselves
"We raised our game at the right time, got the goal and it's enough to win us the game.
"It's a massive three points and a good comeback after the weekend against Sheffield United. It's a great response from the players, so full credit to them."
