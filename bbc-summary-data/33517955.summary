Kesgrave meeting over travellers spews into car park

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A meeting to discuss travellers in a Suffolk town had to be held in a car park because so many residents turned up.

About 70 people attended the meeting at Kesgrave Town Council on Monday night.
On Thursday evening residents blocked green spaces with wheelie bins and cars amid reports of more travellers descending on the town, after 13 caravans arrived last month.
The Gypsy Council called the blockades "pathetic" and "shameful".
Caravans were already in Kesgrave when rumours on social media last week suggested 100 more travellers were set to join an unauthorised camp at Grange Farm.
It led to dozens of people blockading parks, verges and gardens, with agricultural machinery also used to block off an access road.
But despite the reports, just five children and their families attended Holy Family Church for a normal daily Mass on Friday morning.
The travellers at the site are expected to leave soon, but if they do not go, the local council is due to attend another court hearing later to get them evicted.
After the meeting, one resident told the BBC: "The police have got no intention of moving them on. It's like they're scared of them, it's just a big joke really.
Suffolk Coastal District Council leader Ray Herring, who oversaw the meeting, said: "When the last caravan goes we will put in a team to clean up the site and put some temporary measures in to restrict travellers returning."
Speaking about last week's blockades, Candy Sheridan from the Gypsy Council said it was "pathetic" and "un-Christian" when people had travelled miles to celebrate a first communion for the children.
There are 185 authorised travellers pitches in Suffolk, but none in the Suffolk Coastal area.
