General election: Send us your questions

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Adults in the UK voted in a general election yesterday - and the results are coming in.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
No one party has enough Members of Parliament to be in control of government, which means the result is what is called a hung parliament.
So what does it all mean and what's going to happen next?
You might have lots of questions over what this result means for you and other children in the UK.
We'll be putting some of them to a BBC political expert later, so we want to hear from you.
This chat page is now closed - thanks for all your questions!
You must ask your parent, teacher or guardian for permission before you send us a comment and a photo.
We may show your comment on our website or in our TV bulletins. We'll show your first name and which town you're from - but we won't use your details for anything else.
