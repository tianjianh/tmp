Leeds United 3-0 Rotherham United

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Promotion hopefuls Leeds United made it six wins from eight games by shrugging off a lethargic start to beat Rotherham in the Yorkshire derby at Elland Road.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The home side failed to muster a shot on target in a first half in which Tom Adeyemi hit a post for the Millers.
However, defender Kyle Bartley put Leeds ahead soon after the restart, heading in Pablo Hernandez's corner.
Chris Wood rifled home to double the lead before sidefooting his 16th of the season in from Liam Bridcutt's cross.
Leeds remain fifth in the Championship table, after Reading and Huddersfield snatched late wins, with bottom-of-the-table Rotherham still having managed only one point away from home this season.
Wood was recalled to the starting line-up by boss Garry Monk following the 1-1 draw with Aston Villa, with Bartley returning after a knee injury.
Rotherham were the better side in the first half. As well as Adeyemi's effort, they also created a clear chance for Izzy Brown, who fired over the bar.
Beaten only once in their seven previous visits to Leeds, Bartley's goal was a body blow at the start of the second half and Wood was given too much time to bring the ball down on his chest before superbly firing the second into the roof of the net.
His second effort from an unmarked position was the icing on the cake for the Whites, who almost added a late fourth when Hernandez thumped a free-kick against the upright.
Leeds head coach Garry Monk:
"The first half was as poor as I have seen us for many months.
"It was classic from the away team, trying to slow things down, we were playing into their hands.
"There was no aggression, no intensity, no urgency, we were very lucky to come through unscathed. There were a few choice words, we made a change and it had an effect on us.
"The second half was a very good performance, much more like ourselves. No disrespect to Rotherham, but when we play better teams we will not be afforded the luxury of playing like that.
Rotherham United caretaker manager Paul Warne:
"I thought we were excellent in the first half. I came to win the game, these are great places to play.
"To go in 0-0 was a bit of an injustice for us. We created loads and I was enjoying the game, I enjoyed the way we played. Half-time came and I knew it didn't count for anything.
"To concede from a corner was disappointing and it was a blow for my players and they didn't deserve that.
"That first goal changed the game. They get one or two chances, they score, we get one or two chances and don't score. From box to box we were excellent. The fine margins at this level and the quality are going against us."
