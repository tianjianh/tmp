Fugitive Paris attacks suspect Salah Abdeslam has contacted his lawyer, according to an unconfirmed report.

Abdeslam has been on the run since he was driven back to Belgium hours after the gun and bomb attacks which left 130 people dead on 13 November.
Quoting a reliable source, the Belga news agency said he had got in touch with lawyer Sven Mary.
Mr Mary has refused to comment on the report and the federal prosecutor has described it as "only a rumour".
Meanwhile, the Paris prosecutor's office has named Chakib Akrouh as the suicide bomber who blew himself up in a Saint-Denis flat linked to the attackers. Akrouh was a Belgian-Moroccan national, born in Belgium in 1990.
Abdeslam's lawyer told Belgian media he would neither confirm nor deny that contact had been made and Belga did not say when it had happened. "I cannot and do not want to talk," he told Belgian TV news.
Mr Mary denied a similar report last month by Belgian newspaper Het Nieuwsblad.
He has said he would be prepared to represent the fugitive, who is thought to have dropped off three suicide bombers before the attack at the Stade de France.
CCTV pictures emerged this week showing Abdeslam at a petrol station close to the Belgian border in northern France, hours after he allegedly took part in the Paris attacks. He is seen with Hamza Attou, one of two men who are said to have driven him back to Belgium.
Belgian prosecutors said yesterday they had identified three properties used by men involved in the attacks in Paris.
Investigators discovered fingerprints of ringleader Abdelhamid Abaaoud and Stade de France bomber Bilal Hadfi at a flat in Charleroi.
