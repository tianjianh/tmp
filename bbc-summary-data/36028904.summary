American teenager Christian Pulisic drilled in from a tight angle, before Adrian Ramos scored the second.
Hamburg keeper Rene Adler was sent off shortly after half-time for bringing down Shinji Kagawa.
Ramos added a late third as Dortmund moved seven points behind leaders Bayern Munich with four games left.
Thomas Tuchel's side are already assured of Champions League qualification, but look unlikely to stop Bayern winning a fourth consecutive Bundesliga title.
Pep Guardiola's men, who beat Schalke 3-0 on Saturday, could be crowned champions next weekend if they beat fourth-placed Hertha Berlin and Dortmund lose at lowly Stuttgart.
