[SN]TITLE[SN]
Canal murder victim Kenneth O'Brien returned to Republic of Ireland from Australia last month

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man found dead in a suitcase in a County Kildare canal at the weekend had returned to the Republic of Ireland from Australia in December.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Kenneth O'Brien was 33 and from Clondalkin, Dublin.
RTÃ‰ reports that he was last seen alive on Friday and had told his family before he left home that he was going to do some work outside Dublin.
His body was dismembered and wrapped in plastic before being put in a suitcase.
The suitcase was spotted in the water by two people walking along the Grand Canal in Ardclough on Saturday afternoon.
Police believe Mr O'Brien, who worked as a diesel fitter and operator of construction vehicles, was killed elsewhere.
They have again appealed for information about sightings or meetings with Mr O'Brien near his home in Clondalkin or close to the Grand Canal at Ardclough on Friday or Saturday.
"In addition gardai are keen to speak to anyone who may have observed, seen or had any contact with Kenneth since the early hours of Friday morning when he left Lealand Road in Clondalkin or can assist in tracing his movements," they said in a statement.
"Gardai are again asking people returning to their property or premises after the weekend to check to see if there was anything unusual.
"Was a room or equipment disturbed or their premises in anyway different than when they left. Did you as an employee or employer notice anything different in your premises?"
