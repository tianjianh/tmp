The 72-year-old singer was taken to a Los Angeles hospital after playing a sold-out show on Wednesday evening.
In a message posted on Manilow's Facebook page, his management team said it was due to complications arising from an operation he had on Monday.
His next immediate tour dates have been postponed.
"For the next 48 hours, Manilow has been instructed not to talk, sing, or rap," an updated posting on the singer's Facebook page said.
However, those hoping to see the performer will be able to use their tickets for the rescheduled shows.
"Ticket holders should retain their existing tickets for redemption on the night of the new date," the Facebook original statement said.
Manilow is due to attend Monday night's Grammy awards - it's not yet known whether he will still be able to make it.
The New York-born singer, who rose to fame in the 1970s, has a global fanbase. He is best-known for hits Mandy and Copacabana (At the Copa).
He has suffered a series of health scares over his career - having to undergo regular dental treatment after a benign tumour ruptured in his mouth in 1986.
One Last Time, One Last Tour is his final live tour, taking in the UK and North America. It is scheduled to end on 23 June at the O2 Arena in London.
