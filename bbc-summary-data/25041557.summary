Welsh language station BBC Radio Cymru is changing its weekday schedule in the spring with new presenters.

Commercial radio broadcaster Tommo - Andrew Thomas from Cardigan - will be one of the station's main new voices.
And singer and presenter Shan Cothi will front a new morning show.
Programme editor Betsan Powys said the decision followed a consultation with listeners - called Sgwrs - aimed at making the station more relevant to the people of Wales.
"There'll be a range of voices on the station, each one someone's favourite, and each one speaking someone's Welsh," said Ms Powys.
Tommo, who will present an afternoon show, said: "Being given a show on Radio Cymru is like winning a cap for Wales.
"I've worked hard for the local team and now I get to play for the national team," said the presenter, who currently appears on a range of local commercial stations in south and west Wales and is also the Scarlets rugby match announcer in Llanelli.
Ms Powys also confirmed the BBC's plans to launch Cymru Fyw, a Welsh-language digital service on computers and mobile devices, early in 2014.
In April, BBC Cymru Wales director Rhodri Talfan Davies warned that Radio Cymru faced a challenge to remain "successful and vibrant" in the future.
He said the station needed "to reach out to serve the broadest possible Welsh language audience - including those less confident with the language - to fully embrace their lives and passions".
