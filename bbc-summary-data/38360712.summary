Fleetwood Town 0-0 Bury

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Bury finally ended a 12-game losing streak in League One with a goalless draw at Fleetwood.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A swirling wind on the Lancashire coast made life tricky for both sides in the opening 45 minutes but the Shakers adapted better to the conditions and piled pressure on their play-off chasing hosts.
Towering forward Tom Pope was their most potent threat, his back-post header in stoppage time the closest either side went to breaking the deadlock before the break.
Fleetwood boss Uwe Rosler made two half-time changes and Ash Hunter nearly made an immediate impact after being set up on the edge of the box but his shot sliced across the face and wide.
Bury remained a danger and Pope almost dealt a blow to Fleetwood on the hour but took a heavy touch with the goal at his mercy.
George Miller then forced a fingertip save from Alex Cairns and Fleetwood launched a fast break from the loose ball which ended with Chris Long blazing over.
The hosts ended the stronger and Victor Nirennold forced a save late on from Hunter's cross but his header lacked the power to test Rob Lainton.
Lainton was beaten soon after when George Glendon lifted a free-kick over the wall but the woodwork denied the midfielder what would have been a winner.
