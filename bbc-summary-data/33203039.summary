The second T20 game between Ireland and Scotland on Friday was abandoned without a ball being bowled at Bready.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Persistent rain at the the County Tyrone venue led to the decision to call off the match.
The game has been rearranged for Saturday at 15:30 BST with the third and final T20 at Bready on Sunday.
Scotland won Thursday's opener by six wickets with Ireland making 146-5 before a quickfire 60 from Matt Cross helped the visitors to victory.
