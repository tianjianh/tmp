Ross County have no interest in selling Liam Boyce - Jim McIntyre

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Ross County boss Jim McIntyre is determined to retain the services of the Scottish Premiership's top goalscorer Liam Boyce.

In the post-split era, Boyce, 26, is the first player from a bottom-six club to finish the campaign as the league's top marksman, scoring on 23 occasions.
The Northern Ireland striker has a year left on his Staggies contract and his manager hopes he will honour the deal.
"We've no interest in selling him," McIntyre said.
"It is part and parcel of football, he's scoring goals and people are interested. We want to retain Liam but it's football, we can't predict what will happen.
"He's under contract for another season so we look forward to working with him next season."
Boyce helped County seal seventh place with a last-day double in their 2-1 win over Kilmarnock, with his goals accounting for almost half of the 48 scored by the Staggies this campaign.
The forward scored two goals more than nearest challenger, Celtic's Scott Sinclair.
His 23 league strikes, from 34 appearances, give him an average of one goal in every 129 minutes of Premiership football.
When removed from the corresponding matches, those 23 goals also equate to 26 league points, more than half County's eventual total of 46 in a congested bottom half of the table.
"He's been fantastic, to get that amount of goals at a provincial club says a lot about him," McIntyre added.
"He is a fantastic professional who works his socks off and is very conscientious about his job, and he deserves all the success and plaudits that are going his way."
