In a tweet, the train operator acknowledged "severe overcrowding" at Paddington Station.
The company put on 8,000 extra seats for the Ireland-Canada game, which took place at the Millennium Stadium, but had to add 1,500 extra seats.
Passengers have reacted angrily with one describing it as "unforgivable".
