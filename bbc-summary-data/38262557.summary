Tameside children's services: 'Serious failings' found by inspectors

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
"Serious and widespread failings" have been revealed in children's services in Tameside which have been rated "inadequate" by government inspectors.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
An Ofsted inspection found a huge backlog of cases, a high turnover of staff and long delays in assessing children at risk of domestic abuse.
The service was rated "adequate" for safeguarding in 2012.
Tameside Council said it was committed to addressing the points raised "at the earliest opportunity".
When the inspection took place between 26 September and 20 October, there were more than 350 cases awaiting a decision.
The report said some children in need of help and protection "remained at risk of serious harm" for too long however it did not find evidence of "immediate harm".
Children at risk of domestic and sexual abuse were not being dealt with properly, it said.
Inspectors criticised managers and said their actions to address workloads and an increased demand for services had been "ineffective".
Children and families did not have regular contact or meaningful relationships with social workers leading to "drift and delay", they added.
The council's services for looked-after children, rated "good" in March 2012, now "require improvement", the report said.
And, while some looked-after children experience good-quality assessment and care, this is "not consistent for all children".
However, adoption services at Tameside were rated "good".
Council leader Kieran Quinn said he was "disappointed" with the overall rating but said keeping children safe was the council's number one priority.
"No stone will be left unturned in the work to find new, innovative and financially sustainable ways to deliver better services."
The report said the council took immediate steps to make sure the backlog of cases was reduced.
Steven Pleasant, chief executive of the council, said "additional resources" were being provided to deal with the increasing demand.
