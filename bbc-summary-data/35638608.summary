Gerry Cannings, 63, and Lisa Cannings, 48, from Peterborough, won the jackpot in a draw on 13 February.
"It did mean that Gerry had to carry round the winning ticket in his wallet all week. It was very nerve-racking," said Mrs Cannings.
Retired teacher Mr Cannings bought the ticket while collecting fish and chips during a visit to his father in Slough.

Second biggest prize in Lotto history
45 million-to-one odds on winning the jackpot
9 consecutive rollovers resulted in huge prize
15, 16, 23, 39, 48, 59 were the lucky numbers
Mrs Cannings, who still works as a languages teacher, said: "I know it sounds mad, but we had a guy in to paint the whole house.
"We'd been planning it for ages and had packed everything into boxes.
"We just thought it would be easier to wait."
The couple, who have been married for 13 years and have three children and five grandchildren, appeared at a news conference at Orton Hall in Peterborough.
Former history teacher Mr Cannings said "it just didn't seem real" when he realised they had won and his father "didn't believe" him at first.
"It was only when our 11-year-old son read out the winning numbers on TV and they matched did Dad finally believe me.
"Our son asked what it meant. I just said 'Daddy's won an awful lot of money'."
The couple hope to buy a new house, a holiday to New Zealand and a spitfire trip, while Mr Cannings said he wants to upgrade his Skoda Octavia to a Volvo or a Skoda Superb, because he cannot currently fit his golf clubs in his boot.
They matched all six numbers - 15, 16, 23, 39, 48, and 59 - beating odds of 45 million-to-one to win the jackpot, which was the result of nine consecutive rollovers.
The £32,534,188 prize is the second biggest in Lotto's history.
Last month, a Scottish couple shared a record £66m jackpot with another winner, who asked to remain anonymous.
David and Carol Martin, from Hawick in the Scottish Borders, won £33,035,323 in the draw on 9 January following 14 rollovers.
