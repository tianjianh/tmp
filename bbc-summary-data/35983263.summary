[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Seif al-Din Mustafa, 58, used a fake suicide belt to hijack the EgyptAir flight and forced it to fly to Larnaca.
He has been held in Cyprus and the extradition process is expected to be fast-tracked, AFP reported.
Mr Mustafa has been described as being mentally disturbed and can be charged with air piracy, kidnapping and threatening behaviour.
According to Cypriot police, the suspect gave a voluntary statement admitting to the hijacking, the news agency added.
The incident is believed to have been motivated by a row between Mr Mustafa and his ex-wife, who lives in Cyprus.
Egypt had asked Cyprus to hand him over under a 1996 bilateral extradition treaty.

How the hijacking unfolded
EgyptAir flight MS181 was carrying 56 passengers from Alexandria to Cairo, along with six crew and a security official, when it was diverted to Cyprus.
The drama ended with all passengers released unhurt at Larnaca airport and the man giving himself up after a six-hour stand-off.
