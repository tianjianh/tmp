[SN]TITLE[SN]
Mansfield Town 0-1 Grimsby Town

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Mansfield's goal drought extended to four League Two matches as they were beaten at home by Grimsby.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Stags have won only once at home all season and the Mariners leapfrogged them in the table thanks to an Omar Bogle penalty after 17 minutes against the run of play.
Mansfield had started on the front foot and Danny Rose twice went close to an opener.
He saw goalkeeper James McKeown punch away his shot after six minutes and in the 13th minute Ben Davies cleared his header from a corner off the line.

But the visitors' first serious raid saw them snatch the lead. In-form striker Bogle burst into the box to fractionally beat Scott Shearer to the ball and was felled.
Keeper Shearer was booked and Bogle then sent him the wrong way from the spot with a confident penalty.
Mansfield struggled to regain their early confidence and Grimsby defended comfortably, though they allowed Mitch Rose a far-post header after 72 minutes which he planted straight at the keeper.
Grimsby almost doubled their advantage in the 78th minute but Shaun Pearson headed a Dominic Vose corner wide of the far post.
