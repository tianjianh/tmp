Low was ridiculed on social media for his sideline antics during his side's Euro 2016 victory over Ukraine.
"It was adrenaline and concentration. I will try to behave differently in the future," said Low, 56.
"I saw the pictures and obviously sometimes you do things subconsciously. It happened and I am sorry."
Striker Lukas Podolski has also defended his coach, and said the incident was "not an issue" in the Germany camp.
Germany's second Group C match is against Poland on Thursday.
