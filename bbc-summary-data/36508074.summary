Former European champion Sarah Barrow, 27, took first place in the women's 10m platform with a score of 347.90.
Laugher, who won two medals at the European Championships in London last month, recorded 489.25 to win the men's 3m springboard.
The 21-year-old said he hoped recent performances would put him in contention for Rio Olympics selection.
"It means a lot to be British Champion," said the world and European medallist. "My season has gone well so far."
Barrow was pleased to hold off European bronze medallist Georgia Ward, 20, for gold after enduring "two years of injuries".
"I've worked really hard to make sure I was where I needed to be," she said.
"I stuck at my diving. I have a good mindset and I feel like that showed today."
