Lauren Whitmore, a senior at Fordham University, has been identified as the woman in the ID photo by a CBS station.
Ms Whitmore was jogging in Manhattan's Central Park on Monday when she lost the card.
She said if Mr Hanks, star of Castaway and Forrest Gump, wants to return it she will "surely meet him to do that".
Mr Hanks knows what it is like to be reunited with lost items by the kindness of strangers.
He tweeted in March that someone had found his credit card on the street and returned it.
