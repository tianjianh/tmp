The 23-year-old, who hopes to challenge for an Olympic medal in Rio, ran two minutes, 00.57 seconds, just 15 hundredths off her personal best.
Muir enjoyed a superb 2015 season which included a stunning 1500m win in the Oslo Diamond League meeting.
She also recorded a fifth-placed finish at the World Championships in Beijing.
Muir will hope to secure her place in Rio at the British Championships, which double as the Olympic trials, in Birmingham from 24 to 26 June.
