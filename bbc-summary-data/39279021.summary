[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
John Leathem, 32, killed the 15-year-old in a "savage and frenzied" knife attack at his shop in Clydebank, West Dunbartonshire, last March
He stabbed the schoolgirl 61 times before dumping her body in woods.
Companies House has now given two months notice that his business will be struck off the register and its assets handed to the Crown.
Leathem was originally ordered to serve at least 27 years in prison after admitting the murder but the minimum term was cut to 23 years last month on appeal.
A court heard last year how Paige had gone into the delicatessen, on Fleming Avenue, to buy a sandwich before travelling to her Saturday job at a hairdressers.
Leathem, a married father of two, claimed he panicked after Paige threatened to report him for sexual assault when he did not give her a job.
He then launched a "frenzied" knife attack, inflicting more than 140 injuries and stabbing the teenager 61 times.
CCTV footage showed how he later carried her body, wrapped in bin bags, to his car and drove away.
A notice issued by Companies House now gives his business, Delicious Deli Clydebank Ltd, two months notice that it will be struck off the register and dissolved.
The notice adds: "Upon dissolution all property and rights vested in, or held in trust for, are deemed to be bona vacantia and will belong to the crown."
