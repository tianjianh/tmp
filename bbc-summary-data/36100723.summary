Pub and hotel operator Punch has said it will invest more than £3m in its Scottish estate over the next year.

The move could lead to about 250 new jobs across its leased and tenanted pubs, bars, restaurants and hotels.
Punch recently invested a total of £1.5m in refurbishing the Crown Hotel in Stornoway and Portree Hotel on Skye.
It now plans to invest in "key hotel sites" in the north, central belt and Borders, as well as other pubs across Scotland.
Punch operations director Brian Davidson said: "We have over 200 sites in Scotland and are committed to working in partnership with our publicans to build a flourishing pub and hotel estate.
"Tourism and the economy in Scotland are particularly buoyant and we have seen a growing demand for good quality hotel accommodation coupled with traditional Scottish hospitality."
Punch is currently looking for publicans and hoteliers to run its refurbished sites.
Mr Davidson added: "We have some great pubs and hotels coming up for lease that need strong local entrepreneurs to run them.
"As part of our support package, we will work closely with them to develop their business plan, making this a great opportunity for the right candidates to take the lead on running their own invested site."
