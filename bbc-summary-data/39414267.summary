Ipswich Town 3-0 Wigan Athletic

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Wigan's Championship relegation worries deepened with defeat at Ipswich.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Latics are seven points from safety with six games remaining including tough trips to Brighton and Reading.
David McGoldrick put Ipswich ahead midway through the first half, slotting in Myles Kenlock's pass, before Freddie Sears raced clear to double the lead.
Wigan improved after the break, Bartosz Bialkowski saving brilliantly from Ryan Colclough and Alex Gilbey, but Sears pounced late on to make it 3-0.
The win relieved some of the pressure on Town boss Mick McCarthy, following seven draws in their last eight matches, and they are now nine points clear of the relegation zone.
A lack of goals has been one of the Tractor Boys' main issues this campaign, with only Wigan and Rotherham scoring fewer, but striker McGoldrick ended a 15-game drought to set the ball rolling.
It was the Republic of Ireland international's first goal since netting the winner in the reverse fixture on 17 December.
Sears has also been struggling to score this campaign, but the former West Ham forward showed superb composure to fire past Matt Gilks for his fourth goal of the season.
His second had an air of fortune as Gilks saved his first effort, which then fell at his feet for an easy tap-in - but the game was already over at that point.
With an average of 49 points keeping teams in the second tier since three points were introduced for a win in the early 1980s, the Latics, on 34 points, may need to win five of their last six matches to avoid an immediate return to League One.
Ipswich manager Mick McCarthy: "I am delighted about the result and the performance and also a little bit relieved about the fact we got three points and other results went for us.
"I thought David McGoldrick and Freddie Sears epitomised our performance, but I am also not going to just sit here crowing about everything.
"At the start of the second half, it seemed we were conspiring to give them a goal and our fabulous goalkeeper made sure it wasn't 2-1 - though I think we deserved the 3-0 win."
Wigan interim manager Graham Barrow: "The scoreline was fair as we gave them all three goals - but for Matt Gilks in goal, it could have been much worse.
"I am not even going to pretend that was okay. It was suicidal stuff, real kamikaze football and I do personally feel let down.
"Things were said in the dressing room, but they will stay in the dressing room, but the club, supporters and staff don't deserve that kind of performance. Our defending has actually been quite sound this season but all of a sudden that went up in smoke."
