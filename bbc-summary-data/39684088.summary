Fife lightweight Stevie Ray is already looking forward to the UFC event in Glasgow this summer after beating Massachusetts' Joe Lauzon in Nashville on Saturday night.

The 27-year-old from Kirkcaldy was under the cosh in the first five-minute round but then edged ahead with his superior striking against his tiring opponent to win 28-27, 29-27, 28-28.
Ray has won 21 of his 27 fights.
"I want to 'main-event' Glasgow. UFC is coming, I've earned my spot," he said.
"I'm the number one fighter from Scotland and it would be a dream come true to headline there. I'll take anybody. I want that headline spot."
Ray beat the UK's top-ranked lightweight Ross Pearson at UFC Fight Night Belfast last November and with this win over the 32-year-old New Englander Lauzon, tied with Nate Diaz for the most post-fight bonuses, he has further boosted his standing.
Ray told the UFC website: "I thought it was close so I wanted to finish out the third round strong.
"I knew his takedowns and top control during some of the fight could be held against me - even though I was being very active from the bottom - so I wanted to put it all on the table at the end.
"I expected this kind of fight from the beginning. Joe has all of those bonuses and that's because he fights like a warrior. I knew he would be tough and that I'd have to be tougher."
