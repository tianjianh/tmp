[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Former Australia international Shaun Tait has retired from cricket.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 34-year-old pace bowler played three Tests - two against England in the 2005 Ashes - but has plied his trade exclusively in Twenty20 for the past couple of seasons.
He has suffered a number of injuries in his career, including a chronic elbow problem that has prompted his decision to end his career.
"I wanted to play a couple more years," Tait told Cricket Australia.
"The elbow has pretty much gone off a cliff now, it's done and dusted. I'm 34 years old and I suppose when you're not contributing on the field as much as you'd like to, it's time to finish up.
"The game's getting quicker and better and I'm getting slower and a bit older. It's that simple."
Tait was a key player as Australia lifted their third successive World Cup in 2007, finishing as the second joint-highest wicket-taker with 23, while 11 of his 35 one-day appearances came in this tournament.
He also featured in 21 T20 internationals, most recently in a couple of matches against India in January 2016.
He represented Glamorgan in last summer's T20 Blast, having previously played for Durham and Essex, and was most recently with Hobart Hurricanes during the Big Bash League.
