[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Sanjeev Chada, 43, was discharged from Mayo General Hospital shortly after noon on Wednesday and brought to Westport Garda Station.
He is being interviewed about the deaths of his sons, 10-year-old Eoghan and five-year-old Ruairi.
The boys' bodies were found in the boot of a car, which crashed outside Westport on Monday afternoon.
Their father sustained minor injuries when the car he was driving hit a wall at Rosbeg.
Police had earlier issued a child rescue alert seeking the public's help in finding the children.
The alarm was raised at 01:30 BST on Sunday after they failed to return the family home in Ballinkillen, County Carlow, with their father Sanjeev Chada.
The results of post-mortem examinations and toxicology tests on the brothers have not been released for what police said were operational reasons.
It is understood the boys had been dead for a number of hours prior to the crash.
Final preparations are being made to bring the boys' remains back to County Carlow.
