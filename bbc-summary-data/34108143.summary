'Over-reliance on technology' blamed for Coniston callouts

An "over-reliance on electronic equipment" has been blamed for an increase in the number of callouts for Lake District mountain rescuers.

Coniston Mountain Rescue Team has so far sprung into action 44 times this year - one more than the whole of 2014.
The organisation's Jeff Carroll said people relying on systems such as GPS and maps on mobile phones has been a major issue.
He called on walkers and bikers to carry a compass and paper map.
Mr Carroll told BBC Cumbria: "This year we have seen quite a few mountain bikers coming to grief.
"The other thing is this over-reliance on electronic equipment - people using GPS and mapping on their phones, which is only ever really any good when the phone's got decent signal or battery.
"You speak to some people and they say, 'Yes, we're well equipped. We've got shorts and a T-shirt.' That's not really well equipped.
"There's an element of people just not understanding the conditions - how much different it is on the top of Coniston Old Man compared to walking down a road in the village."
Rescues in recent months have included a cyclist who got lost in Grizedale Forest, unprepared walkers who became disorientated in mist on Coniston Old Man and a request to look for a missing dog.
The team's 44th callout came during the bank holiday weekend.
