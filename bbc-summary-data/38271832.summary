[SN]TITLE[SN]
Leeds United 1-0 Brentford

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Kyle Bartley's late header gave Championship play-off hopefuls Leeds a win against Brentford.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
In a first half of few chances, Bees striker Scott Hogan rightly had a goal ruled out for offside.
Luke Ayling hammered an effort over the bar from a Stuart Dallas corner before Souleymane Doukara dragged a shot wide as Leeds took control after the break.
The game looked destined to end level before Bartley headed home from a Dallas corner to send the hosts fifth.
The win means Garry Monk's men have won four of their last five league games.
They dominated possession and chances in the second half but missed the presence and cutting edge of striker Chris Wood, who was ruled out with a hamstring injury.
However, with time running out, Bartley flicked a header beyond Daniel Bentley.
Brentford, who had won their last two games, remain in 14th place.
Leeds head coach Garry Monk:
"We've won seven of our last nine home games and that's great, but it was obvious we weren't at our best today. I thought we looked tired, especially in the first 60 minutes.
"The sense was that it was going to be one of those days, but it was a great header from Barts and I think the roof came off the place when that goal went in.
"It's great to see that mentality, fight and spirit from the players to keep going right to the end."
Brentford boss Dean Smith:
"I'm very disappointed; I don't think we deserved that. For an hour we were very good and made a good team look average.
"It was a typical Championship game - chances were at a premium - and that's why it was so cruel to lose it at the end.
"It (the disallowed goal) wasn't justified. I've seen the replays and he was marginally onside. Sometimes you get them and today we didn't."
