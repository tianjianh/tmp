They will battle it out against Muse, Coldplay and Lady Gaga for the honour.
Both Blur and the Roses are also shortlisted for best live act after reuniting for highly-anticipated shows this summer, along with The Cribs, Radiohead and Bruce Springsteen.
Noel Gallagher and Florence Welch also have two nominations each.
Both are in the running for best solo artist with Adele and Olympics opening ceremony performers Dizzee Rascal and Emeli Sande.
'Unforgettable year'
"It's been the most incredible year for British music," Q magazine editor Andrew Harrison said.
"Our bands and our anthems transformed the Olympics into the greatest music event on Earth. And amazing comeback shows from Blur and the Stone Roses showed the enduring appeal of our greatest musicians."
He added that the nominees for this year's Q Awards all "helped make 2012 an absolutely unforgettable year".
The best album category sees Paul Weller's Sonik Kicks and Bobby Womack's The Bravest Man In The Universe nominated alongside Richard Hawley's Standing At The Sky's Edge, The Black Keys El Camino and The Maccabees' Given to the Wild.
Alabama Shakes, Lianne La Havas, Django Django, Alt J and rapper Frank Ocean are all nominated for best new act.
A number of honorary awards will also be presented on the day, with other prizes including best track and best video.
Here is a list of the nominations in full, with winners due to be announced at a London ceremony, hosted by Pub Landlord comedian Al Murray, on 2 October:
