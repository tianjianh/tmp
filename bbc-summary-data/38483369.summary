Cemetery chapel may become 'quirky' Stroud holiday let

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A Victorian chapel of rest in a Gloucestershire cemetery could be turned into "quirky holiday accommodation" by the town council.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The building, amid six acres (2.4 hectare) of graves at Stroud Cemetery, is being sold by the district council.
Stroud Town Council has been given "first refusal" on the building, estimated to be worth about Â£150,000.
Mayor Kevin Cranston said they were starting a "quick feasibility study into what we could do with it".
Built in the 1850s, the twin chapels linked by a tower and arch were developed along with the cemetery after the town's overcrowded burial grounds became a health threat.
"It's quite a beautiful building - there were two chapels, one for Church of England and the other for others," Mr Cranston said.
"Everybody - apparently - came through the arch as the bell tolled and went left or right depending on their denomination.
"Then they rested in the chapel overnight and the following day they'd be taken off to their burial."
The chapel, now used by the cemetery's maintenance team to store tools and equipment, will be bought by the town council if a suitable purpose can be found.
"We can't take out a massive mortgage on a building just to use it as a tool shed," said Mr Cranston.
"We've had ideas like turning it into a cafe, a community centre or convert it into quirky holiday accommodation - we could probably charge more at Halloween.
"But really we're open to suggestions but they do have to be financially viable and sustainable."
