Irish Open: Royal County Down course cost only £4 to create

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The world's golfing superstars may be competing for prize money of 2.5m euros (£178m) at this year's Irish Open, but the host course at Royal County Down cost a mere £4 to create.

The golf club at the foot of the Mourne Mountains was founded in 1889 after the development of a railway line from Belfast, and the emergence of Newcastle as a popular seaside resort.
The initial nine-hole layout, which opened on 23 March 1889, was created by George L Baillie, a Scottish schoolteacher who came to Belfast and embarked on a personal crusade to establish golf courses.
It was so successful that golf pioneer, Old Tom Morris, travelled from his home in St Andrews, Scotland, to advise on constructing a further nine holes "for a sum not to exceed £4".
Old Tom, whose real name was Thomas Mitchell Morris, spent two days at Royal County Down in July 1889.
Three new holes were added immediately, then a further six, and the full 18-hole championship course was ready to play by July 1890.
During the next two decades, George Combe, captain in 1896 and convenor of the green, 1900 to 1913, and other famous golfers of the time made further recommendations after visiting the course.
In 1908, King Edward VII bestowed royal patronage on the club.
In 1925, golf course architect, Harry Colt (who also created Royal Portrush), was asked to advise on further improvements.
The alterations that ensued created the present 4th and 9th holes, which are two of the most photographed holes in world golf, due to the stunning mountain backdrop.
These days, the club has two 18-hole links courses, the Championship Course and the Annesley Links.
World number one Rory McIlroy describes the championship course as his favourite in the world.
The Irish Open returns to Royal County Down this year after 76 years. The course previously hosted the event three times, all prior to World War II.
More than 125 years after the club first began, the words of respected golf writer Bernard Darwin (grandson of Charles), written more than 70 years ago, still ring true.
He described the Royal County Down course as: "One of big and glorious carries, nestling greens, entertainingly blind shots, local knowledge and beautiful turf.
"The kind of golf that people play in their most ecstatic dreams."
