The cause of death was complications from pneumonia, his daughter Donna  told the Los Angeles Times.
He wrote Bob Hope and Bing Crosby movie Road to Bali, released in 1952, and also adapted Tennessee Williams' play The Rose Tattoo for the screen.
He also wrote scripts for the Academy Awards broadcasts, for which he won two of his three Emmy awards.
Writing for the Academy Awards was his longest-running job, spanning more than 30 years.
Kanter won another Emmy for The George Gobel Show in 1955.
He also wrote and directed another Presley movie, Loving You, and wrote the screenplays for Bob Hope's Bachelor in Paradise and Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis' Money from Home.
Kanter was also behind the TV show Julia, which aired from 1968-71.
It was the first sitcom to star an African American actress as a professional rather than a domestic.
He is survived by his wife of 70 years, writer Doris Kanter, his three daughters and a granddaughter.
