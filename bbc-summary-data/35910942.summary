Summer Grant, from Norwich, died in Harlow, Essex, on Saturday.
Her mother Cara Blackie said: "Words just can't explain how I am feeling right now, life is just truly cruel," adding that she was "heartbroken".
A woman, 24, and a man, 27, have been arrested on suspicion of manslaughter by gross negligence, and bailed.
Ms Blackie added: "Summer was a bright beautiful and most loving little girl. It is so unfair that you have been taken, it just doesn't make sense."
Summer's father Lee Grant said: "She was the most happy, polite and beautiful girl in the world. I still can't come to terms she's not here."
Paramedics were called on Saturday afternoon to Harlow Town Park, where an event organised by Thurston fun fairs was taking place.
Summer was treated by ambulance crews but later died in hospital.
A post-mortem examination established the cause of her death as multiple injuries, Essex Police said.
It is believed the dome-shaped inflatable carrying Summer blew over a number of trailers and caravans in the park.
Ray Smith, a representative of the Showmen's Guild of Great Britain, said: "It was a sudden gust. Had it been a consistent wind they would have closed down all the inflatables."
Conservative MP for Harlow Robert Halfon said in a statement he would be asking for an "urgent inquiry" and to consider whether bouncy castles "should be banned from Harlow town fairs, until we can be sure that they are completely safe, so such a horrific tragedy never happens again".
Jon Clempner, leader of Harlow Council, said on Sunday: "Harlow is a town in shock following this tragic incident yesterday.
"I can't imagine the heartache of the parents and family of the little girl who has died, and my thoughts are with them."
Police have asked anyone with mobile phone video footage of the incident to get in touch.
