Hardy told a club Twitter Q&A that efforts to sign players would now be made before the end of the January transfer window.
The Magpies were under embargo for failing to make required payments to HM Revenue & Customs and other clubs.
Manager Kevin Nolan said on Thursday he was hopeful the Magpies could sign players "within 72 hours".
Former West Ham United striker Carlton Cole was named by Nolan as one player who could join Notts.
Hardy, who completed his takeover of the club on 11 January, also identified ex-Nottingham Forest defender Kelvin Wilson was another possible new arrival.
Meanwhile, Notts have appointed Richard Thomas - who worked alongside Nolan at his previous club Leyton Orient - as their new assistant manager.
