Fresh plans have been drawn up for the biggest transformation of Cardiff Central railway station since it was built in the 1850s.

Last year, Network Rail released images that included a wave effect roof but this has now been stripped back to a more standard glass-fronted entrance.
There would also be new retail space and a mezzanine floor.
The work coincides with plans to revamp that area of the city centre which is where the new BBC building will be.
A new bus terminal is also being built in the area.
The earliest work on the station could start in 2019 but Network Rail has yet to fully cost the multimillion-pound plans.
Other works at the station are being carried out, including a new south entrance.
Currently, 13 million people use Cardiff Central per year and that figure is expected to grow to 23 million by 2023.
Mark Langman, route managing director for Network Rail Wales, said: "Our railway is carrying almost 50% more passengers than we were 10 years ago and that number is predicted to grow significantly in the years ahead, with up to 32m passengers forecast to use Cardiff Central station by 2043.
"There is still more to do to meet future demand and to build a station fit for a capital city."
