Friars Walk in Newport and a major road adjacent to it were closed for nearly five hours on Thursday afternoon after a bomb disposal team was called.
A suspect package was also reported at the nearby George Street bridge.
Gwent Police said on Friday no viable devices were found at either site and inquiries continued. The incident is not thought to be terror-related.
The force also thanked members of the public who offered bottled water and snacks to officers at the scene.
