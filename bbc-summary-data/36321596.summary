[SN]TITLE[SN]
County Championship: Somerset skipper Chris Rogers hits ton on Lord's return

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Somerset skipper Chris Rogers marked his return to Lord's to meet his old county Middlesex with a century before a premature end to the day's play.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
After the early loss of Marcus Trescothick, one of two victims for Toby Roland Jones, Rogers put on 85 for the second wicket with Tom Abell (41).
He then shared a unbroken third-wicket stand of 125 with James Hildreth.
When play was finally called off at 18:00 BST, Rogers was on 104, with Hildreth on 60, in a total of 219-2.
Nine of the former Australia Test opener's 74 first-class centuries have now come at Lord's.
That is a total exceeded only by the 13 he has run up at the WACA in Perth, where he spent 10 seasons playing for Western Australia.
