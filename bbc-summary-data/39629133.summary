[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A new scheme to help smokers kick the habit has been launched across Wales.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Help Me Quit aims to increase awareness of the range of NHS support services available to help smokers quit.
Wales has about 492,000 smokers and about 68% of those asked said they wanted to quit, according to the Welsh Health Survey of 2015.
Studies have shown smokers are four times more likely to quit using medication and behavioural support.
Ashley Gould, public health consultant at Public Health Wales, said: "Following recent research with smokers in Wales, it became clear that many who want to quit were not aware of the services available to them and the type of NHS support they could tap into.  Help Me Quit will help put this right."
