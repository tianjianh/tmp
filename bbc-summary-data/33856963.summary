The 16-year-old girl, from Wigan, was paddling with another girl, aged 14, at North Quay in Heysham when they got into difficulty at about 16:00 BST.
The older girl was rescued by a passing small boat and is in a serious condition, police said.
The younger girl is said to be shaken and suffered superficial injuries.
Sgt Mark Finch, of Lancaster Police, said: "The girls were fortunate enough that they were spotted getting into some difficulty and were able to get back to the shore, but one of the girls remains very poorly at hospital as a result of the incident.
"This is a timely reminder to anyone enjoying the school holidays and the good weather to remember the dangers of the tide and of open water and to enjoy them safely and responsibly."
