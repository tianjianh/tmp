Game of Thrones star Iwan Rheon on Our Girl: 'I thought I was in Apocalypse Now'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
For his role in Our Girl, Iwan Rheon had to film scenes in a Huey helicopter, the side window open, flying over the plains of South Africa.

"I looked down at the ground and there was the shadow of the helicopter and I thought I was in Apocalypse Now."
So far, so movie-like.
"But then I turned around and Lacey (Turner) said, 'My seatbelt's come off' so I quickly started to hope that we weren't going to lose our leading actress."
Helicopter hiccups aside, the danger was avoided and the cast got through filming for the second series of the military drama.
It began last week on BBC One, continuing the story of Lacey Turner's army medic Molly Dawes as she heads to Afghanistan.
Rheon has returned as Smurf ("It's not a sexy name"), an ex-flame of Turner's character.
"She's such a fantastic actress," he said. "She knows what she's doing. She doesn't mess around.
"The way she's learnt her trade in a soap opera (She was Stacey Slater in Eastenders). She makes her decisions on how to deliver lines at home. She gets on."
Rheon did his time in soap too, working for two years on Welsh language series Pobol y Cwm.
"There's no time to be an actor when you do soap," he said. "There's incredible productivity in soap opera. It's so difficult. Maybe that's why me and Lacey get on."
As filming in Afghanistan was impossible, South Africa acted as an Afghan substitute.
"It was incredible experience, a beautiful place," he said.
"But working in the helicopter was hard because the scenes are so intense, you're about to land and you go, 'Look at that giraffe over there'."
If you weren't a soap fan living in Wales, Rheon's also recognisable from his time as Sean in Misfits.
Saying that, you might know him as Sir Ian McKellen's co-star in sitcom Vicious.
More likely, you'll detest or love him as The Bastard of Bolton in Game Of Thrones.
"I guess I don't really mind playing detestable," he said. "The fact that people find him detestable means I'm doing well I suppose."
He confirms he's filming the new series but discussing any plot points in THAT show is out of bounds. Plus we didn't want any spoilers anyway.
Considering the level of success Game Of Thrones has had, plus the obsession of its fans, it's surprising that Rheon doesn't run into more trouble when he's off set.
"I've never been abused in the street but I know that when people see me and (co-star) Alfie Allen out at the bar after filming, they say 'I don't know how you are friends'.
"I say to them, 'Well, do you believe in dragons too?'"
He and Alfie Allen are mates off-screen but to be honest, the way things are right now, it's not clear how long that will last.
"I'm absolutely destroying him at pool at the moment. I'm winning 6-1 but he keeps coming back for more."
