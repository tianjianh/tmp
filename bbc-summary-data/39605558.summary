Huddersfield Town 1-4 Fulham

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Fulham came from behind to score four first-half goals and thrash play-off rivals Huddersfield, moving them to within two points of their opponents.

The hosts led when Chris Lowe drilled in from the spot after the defender was brought down in the box by Floyd Ayite.
But in a five-minute spell Scott Malone levelled from a tight angle and Tom Cairney's penalty put Fulham ahead.
Stefan Johansen fired in a rebound to make it 3-1 and the Norwegian robbed Jonathan Hogg to complete the scoring.
A win for Huddersfield would have sealed their play-off place but they remain five points clear of seventh-placed Leeds, who were beaten at Burton.
Fulham, the Championship's top scorers, also benefitted from Leeds' slip-up as Slavisa Jokanovic's side now have a three-point buffer in sixth.
Ayite, who conceded a penalty for the opener, won the spot-kick which put the Cottagers in front as he was felled by Hogg.
A less eventful second half saw Rajiv van La Parra curl wide for the Terriers, while Collin Quaner was denied by Marcus Bettinelli when through one-on-one.
David Wagner's side have now gone 11 games against Fulham without winning, while seven of Huddersfield's 13 league defeats have come against sides currently occupying the top six.
Huddersfield Town head coach David Wagner: "It's still in our own hands and we have three games left. We have shown unbelievable consistency all season and we have been in the top six virtually the whole season. In my opinion we have been the most consistent team in this division so far.
"Fulham are a great side and deserved their win but we played a big part with the errors we made. Defeat hurts, of course, but I have been able to trust the players who made mistakes over the whole season and we move on.
"The start we made probably cost us as we lost focus and concentration and against a team like Fulham you need to focus. To move on you have to know why you lost and we know why we lost."
Fulham head coach Slavisa Jokanovic: "I am very happy at how we are at this time. We are solid and this is important for us. To win 4-1 is a great result but perhaps I miss the clean sheet.
"The team showed great character and confidence and we were very brave. We scored four goals but it could have been more. Our standards are improving and this is exactly what we have to do.
"I am not looking at the table. I am only thinking about the next game. Now we need to rest and concentrate on the regular part of this competition."
