Durham County Council: Budget savings rise to £222m

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Durham County Council has said it faces a spending cut of £20m more than previously thought.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Labour-run authority said that additional reductions in Government grants meant its savings target for 2011 to 2017 had now risen to £222m.
It is considering what action to take in response to what it describes as "the increasing budget pressures".
A meeting of its cabinet will be held on 9 October, and a public consultation will take place in due course.
Council leader, Simon Henig, said the views of residents were vital "during this very difficult process".
He added that it was "crucial everyone has their say".
