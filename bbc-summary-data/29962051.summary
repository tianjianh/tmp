The X Factor needs a "change of format" to attract new audiences, claims Redfoo, one of the judges on the Australian version of the show.

The UK version of the talent show is losing out to Strictly Come Dancing in the ratings battle.
"A TV show is sometimes like a club." he tells Newsbeat. "Sometimes you need to refresh.
"It could be a number of things, you've got to keep getting new energy in there. People want to see new stuff.
"That's what I feel like I did for the Australian show because it was the fourth series [fifth if you include the one in 2005] and the had the same panel and stuff and then I came in and they really marketed that.
"Ratings shot up with an element of newness."
Redfoo joined as a judge on The X Factor Australia in 2013, alongside Natalie Bassingthwaighte, Dannii Minogue and Ronan Keating.
"Some of the contestants are performing better than the superstar guests, their energy and the way that they're commanding the audience. It's incredible," he says.
"The X Factor is like music camp. It's invaluable what in a short amount of time The X Factor can do to an artist and a person's career.
"It can make them a superstar overnight."
Redfoo originally found fame as one half of LMFAO but he has since pursued a career as a solo artist; his latest single is called New Thang.
He tells Newsbeat he and his nephew Sky Blu are likely to reform the group "in the future, when the time is right".
He adds: "Now we're both pretty comfortable just doing our solo stuff. I think one day we will come back together bigger and stronger than ever."
Redfoo is due to appear at the MTV EMAs in Glasgow on Sunday, having previously presented the event in Amsterdam in 2013.
"It means a lot," he says. "Growing up, MTV has always been an outlet for music videos and pop culture.
"They're so edgy and cool so them having me back this year is an honour and I'm excited because they like what I do."
