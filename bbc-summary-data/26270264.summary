It will be the ninth edition fronted by the 75-year-old, who first hosted the results programme in 1979 when Margaret Thatcher became prime minister.
Dimbleby will front the election show on 7 May 2015 from 22:00 BST until the following morning.
BBC News presenter Huw Edwards will take over as lead presenter for the corporation's future election coverage.
Edwards will also present the 2015 coverage from 07:00 BST on 8 May after Dimbleby finishes his overnight stint, tracking the final results.
A special edition of Question Time will follow later that evening to discuss the vote and prospects for the next government.
"This election is likely to be one of the most complex and closely fought in recent times and we are delighted to have such an experienced team to lead our coverage," James Harding, director of BBC news, said.
Ahead of the general election, Dimbleby will present the local and European election results programmes this May from the BBC's Elstree Studios.
Edwards will also present the Scottish independence referendum results programme from Glasgow in September.
