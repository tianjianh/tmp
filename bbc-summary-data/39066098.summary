Conor McPhillips: Bristol name Pat Lam's assistant ahead of next season

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Connacht backs coach Conor McPhillips is to follow Pat Lam to Premiership club Bristol as assistant coach from the end of the current season.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Former Connacht back McPhillips, 36, was initially appointed as assistant attack coach by Lam at the Pro12 side in 2015 and became backs coach in 2016.
In December, Lam was named as Bristol's new boss ahead of next season, after Andy Robinson was sacked in November.
"Connacht has been a very special place to me for 15 years," said McPhillips.
"I have a close relationship with Pat. Bristol have an exciting array of talent in their squad and I'm relishing the opportunity to work with them."
