Stokes, 27, spent the latter part of last season on loan at Hibernian, scoring twice in May's Scottish Cup final victory against Rangers.
He leaves Celtic Park having scored 77 goals in 192 games, and helped them win four titles and two Scottish Cups.
The Republic of Ireland forward had previously been linked with Rotherham.
He began his career at Arsenal, and spent time at Falkirk, Sunderland and Hibs before the move to Celtic in 2010.
His decision to join Rovers followed a meeting with new manager Owen Coyle.
"I get a feeling for moves a lot of the time and there were different options available, but this time round this seemed like the right move for me," he told the club website.
"He had only positive things to say about me and I'm just looking forward to bedding in, getting a good pre-season under my belt and the start of the season.
"For myself, having a manager that believes in me gives me a lot of confidence and as a striker you need that, but it's going to be down to how I perform."
