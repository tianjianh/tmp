The 37 affordable homes in Newbury's flagship Parkway complex have been empty for almost two years.
Standard Life Investments said it remained entirely focused on fulfilling its contractual obligations.
West Berkshire Council, which is taking the action, put Â£900,000 towards the homes.
Council leader Gordon Lundie said: "I am extremely cross. There's 37 families in Newbury who are waiting to get access to this affordable housing.
"We're going to take legal action now and the first part of that is a 28-day process whereby we will see if they can remedy the situation and get the affordable housing produced."
In a statement the developer said it shared the frustrations of the council over the delay and that it was in advanced negotiations with its preferred affordable housing provider.
It added: "Our team is working hard to bring the sale to a conclusion."
