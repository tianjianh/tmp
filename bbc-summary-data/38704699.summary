The club will have to leave their Stamford Bridge home for up to three years during the construction of a new Â£500m 60,000-seat stadium.
Twickenham was an option being considered by the club but a spokesperson for the Rugby Football Union (RFU) said it would not happen.
Chelsea have declined to comment.
Wembley Stadium is thought to be another possible venue being considered by the club.
But Tottenham Hotspur have been given the option to temporarily relocate to the national stadium for the 2017-18 season.
Harrow East MP Bob Blackman has also raised concerns about the "potential abuse" of the "national treasure" if either club turns Wembley into their temporary home.
Chelsea could stay at Stamford Bridge while redevelopment work takes place but this is thought to be the most expensive option.
The club have been granted permission to demolish their current ground and replace it with one designed by architects Herzog and de Meuron.
London Mayor Sadiq Khan will still have the final say on whether the development goes ahead.
