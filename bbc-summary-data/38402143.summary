Her other recent credits include Dreamgirls, Funny Girl and 1984.
Kenny Wax, who produced The Play That Goes Wrong, and Fiery Angel, which produced the Kenneth Branagh Theatre Company West End season, are also nominated in the category.
Winners are decided by the senior editorial team at The Stage, the theatre publication established in 1880.
Sir Matthew Bourne's New Adventures is nominated for the international award this year, alongside the Graeae Theatre Company and the Big in Belgium season at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe.
Alistair Smith, print editor of The Stage and chair of the judging panel, said: "Our exceptional shortlist this year is a blend of big and small, established and new.
"The Stage Awards are the only theatre awards that celebrate the whole stunning spectrum of theatre, encompassing London, regional, fringe and international work."
The Royal Court Theatre in Liverpool, the Tara Theatre in London and the King's Cross Theatre are all nominated for theatre building of the year.
Two new categories have been introduced this year - the innovation award and the sustainability award.

Winners will be announced at a ceremony on 27 January at the Theatre Royal Drury Lane.
