The game was abandoned after 48 minutes at 0-0 following a pitch invasion by hundreds of protesting home fans.
It was held up for more than an hour before being called off.
The relegated Seasiders remain bottom of the Championship while the Terriers stay 16th finishing on 55 points.
As well as deciding on a verdict for the charge, a Football Disciplinary Committee will also be asked to consider compensation for Huddersfield and ticket refunds to supporters.
"The board took the view that the 0-0 score line that stood at the time of the game's abandonment should be officially recorded as the final result of the match, as it believes that league points should always be earned on the field of play," said a statement.
Before the match, 2,000 Blackpool fans protested outside the ground against the club's owners, the Oyston family.
