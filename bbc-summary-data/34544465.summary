Michael Fassbender and Kate Winslet have brought the BFI London Film Festival to a close with their film about computer pioneer Steve Jobs.

Fassbender, who plays the late Apple co-founder, said it was "pretty special" to have the film as the closing night gala.
Also on the red carpet in London's Leicester Square were director Danny Boyle and screenwriter Aaron Sorkin.
Boyle said Jobs had "changed our lives in an extraordinary ways."
It is the third Boyle film to close the festival, following Slumdog Millionaire and 127 Hours.
Steve Jobs, which will be released in the UK on 13 November, spans a period of 14 years and focuses on three product launches - the Macintosh in 1984, the NeXT Cube in 1988 and the iMac in 1998.
Speaking at a press conference ahead of Sunday night's gala screening, Sorkin was keen to point out that the film was not a traditional biopic of Jobs and defended the accuracy of his storytelling.
"What we don't see in this movie is a dramatic recreation of his Wikipedia page. What you see is a dramatisation of several of the personal conflicts that he had in his life. I do believe they are fair, my conscience is clear."
Sorkin's dialogue-packed script ran to 185 pages - far longer than a regular screenplay. Fassbender described it as "the best script that I've ever read".
Winslet, who plays Jobs's colleague Joanna Hoffman, is almost unrecognisable with an 80s hairstyle and large glasses when appearing in the first act of the film.
"Much has been made about the length of the script and how much there was to learn," she said. "But you just get on with it."
On the red carpet, she told the BBC that making the film had been "a great journey" and that she had got to spend time with the real Hoffman, who had been "great at sharing her stories".
"There weren't many women in Steve's life who could stand up to him in that way but also give him a big hug before a launch," she said.
"Joanna saw the film and said she really like it and enjoyed the fact that Michael [Fassbender] was able to show some of Steve's 'real warmth'."
Also on the red carpet were the film's co-stars Jeff Daniels, who plays former Apple CEO John Sculley, Katherine Waterston who plays Jobs' ex-girlfriend Chrisann Brennan,  and Michael Stuhlbarg who plays Andy Hertzfeld, one of the original members of the Apple Mac development team.
Over its 12 days, the London Film Festival (LFF) had screened 240 feature films from 72 countries.
On Saturday night, Chevalier - about six men who embark on a boat trip together - won the best film award. The movie was directed by Greek filmmaker Athina Rachel Tsangari.
The festival had kicked off with period drama Suffragette, starring Carey Mulligan, Meryl Streep and Helena Bonham Carter.
LFF director Clare Stewart, who had declared this year's theme as "the year of the strong woman", told the BBC that it had been "a terrific year".
"We have been able to amplify some important issues from the industry around gender equality in front and behind the camera," she said.
"To have three films directed by women taking awards last night was the icing on the cake."
