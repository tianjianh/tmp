The chemical formaldehyde has been found after a primary school was closed because a smell made some children ill.

About 20 pupils were affected at Flash Ley Community Primary School and Nursery in Stafford on Friday.
The county council said the school would be shut until "all issues have been addressed". Arrangements are in place for children to go elsewhere.
Long-lasting health problems were unlikely following the "strong odour," the council said.
Formaldehyde is a toxic compound often used as a disinfectant and for embalming.
It can irritate the skin and cause breathing and digestive problems.
Ben Adams, council cabinet member for education and skills, said: "Symptoms of sore eyes, sore throats, runny noses, tightness of the chest, nausea and vomiting could be related to exposure to formaldehyde in the air, but for some children there could be other causes."
The council said testing revealed "high levels of formaldehyde, a common substance that is used extensively in buildings, internal furnishings and household products".
It said it was working closely with Public Health England and the Health and Safety Executive to investigate the cause of the incident, which was believed to be linked to work carried out on floors during the summer.
Public Health England said it was "satisfied that children and staff are not at risk of ongoing exposure".
Arrangements to educate children at the nearby Chetwynd Centre, Tillington Manor and Stafford Manor High were put in place, the council said.
Head teacher Simon Barker said offering alternative school provision was to allow for "more tests to be conducted within the school and to ensure all the issues have been addressed".
A helpline has been set up for parents.
