A man has been accused of murdering a 15-year-old boy in a "deliberate and gratuitous stabbing", a court heard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Alan Cartwright was cycling with friends in Caledonian Road, north London, when he was targeted by a group of robbers in February.
Joshua Williams, 18, is on trial accused of lashing out at Alan with a blade, delivering the single stab wound which led to his death.
He denies charges of murder and conspiracy to rob at the Old Bailey.
The incident was captured on CCTV and the footage shows Alan and his two friends being pushed off their bikes by three youths.
Opening the trial, prosecutor Jonathan Rees QC described the attack as "deliberate and gratuitous".
He said Alan had been a "harmless person" who was assaulted as he was "innocently riding his bike with his mates".
Jurors were told that the main issue in the case was the identity of a third robber who the prosecution say is Mr Williams.
Mr Williams, of Davenant Road, north London, says he has an alibi.
He was "crying hysterically" when he was brought to Islington police station with his parents, Mr Rees told the jury.
When asked why they were there, his mother was said to have told an officer it was about the stabbing in Caledonian Road, saying: "Yes, he's involved, he did it."
The trial continues.
