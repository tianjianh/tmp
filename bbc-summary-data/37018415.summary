[SN]TITLE[SN]
Bromley 2-2 Aldershot Town

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Bromley picked up their first point of the season in a pulsating 2-2 draw at home to Aldershot.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Shots led when Jake Gallagher's cross-shot was prodded in by Scott Rendell.
Summer signing Matt McClure then wound his way past two home defenders, and beat Alan Julian clinically to double the lead with 21 minutes gone.
A relived Bromley finally got their first goal of the season before the break when Joe Anderson centred for Tobi Sho-Silva to head one back.
In the second half, Anderson nearly undid his good work when he headed against his own crossbar from a Jim Kellermann free-kick.
It proved a crucial turn of luck, as substitute Louis Dennis drove past the goalkeeper to level at 2-2 in the 74th minute.
