Swansea were  beaten 2-1 at Hull and manager Paul Clement has warned his side remain in danger of relegation.
But Cork says Swansea, who were bottom at the turn of the year, can bounce back from Saturday's loss.
"Considering where we were in January to where we are now, we're still three points off it," Cork said.
"We just need to keep up the good form we had in the last couple of months.
"We've been in good form lately and we can't let it affect us."
Hull remain in the relegation zone, but moved up to 18th with a win which took them within three points of Swansea in 16th spot.
Swansea travel to Bournemouth next Saturday, a side two places and three points ahead of them in the bottom half of the table.
"It will be a massive game and it will be nice going into the international game with three points," midfielder Gylfi Sigurdsson said.
"All of the games are big games and it's important that we keep picking up points from all of the games.
"We're playing well enough at the moment and there's a lot of confidence in the team as well.
Sigurdsson and Cork reflected on a "frustrating" afternoon for the Swans at the KCOM Stadium.
Substitute Oumar Niasse, on loan from Everton, scored twice for Hull before Alfie Mawson pulled a goal back for Swansea in injury time.
"I thought we created enough chances to a least get a point if not to win the game," Sigurdsson said.
"I think from our point of view they were two sloppy goals to give away."
Fellow midfielder Cork added: "It was a tough game and it was always going to be a hard game because they needed that win.
"We had a lot of chances in the game and we could have made it different and they took their chance at the end and followed that with another one.
"Maybe we could have got back into it at the end, but it was one of those games. We left it too late."
Swansea lost striker Fernando and defender Angel Rangel in the first half while Martin Olsson suffered a  knock, but had to carry on with Swansea having used their substitutes.
Top-scorer Llorente suffered a dead leg while fellow Spaniard Rangel twisted his ankle and Clement said the injuries "hurt" Swansea.
"We were very unlucky with injuries," Sigurdsson said.
"Martin had to carry on to make sure we weren't down to 10 men.
"It was very frustrating, but hopefully the boys will be alright for the next game."
