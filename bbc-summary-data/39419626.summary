[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Gytis Griskevicius is alleged to have attacked Marina Erte, 33, at her flat just hours after celebrating his birthday at a barbecue with friends.
Lincoln Crown Court heard he killed her after finding out she was in a relationship with another man.
Griskevicius, 32, of St Ann's Lane, Boston, denies murder.

Prosecutor William Harbage QC told the court Ms Erte's naked body was found in the bath at her flat  by firemen who had been called out by neighbours.
He said: "She had been severely beaten about the head causing facial fractures and traumatic brain injury."
"She had then been placed in the bath and drowned by holding a shower attachment up against her face deliberately," he added.
Mr Harbage told the jury that Griskevicius celebrated his birthday the day before the alleged murder at a barbecue with his housemates.
However, on the 20 May, it is alleged Griskevicius visited a supermarket with his ex to buy whisky and crisps before returning to her flat.
The court heard the attack "was motivated by jealousy" after the defendant discovered Ms Erte was in a relationship with another man.
"We say he had a motive and the opportunity," Mr Harbage told the court.
After being arrested Griskevicius, lied to police about his movements, the prosecutor added.
The prosecution claims the defendant also confessed to murdering his wife to a cellmate while on remand.
The trial continues.
