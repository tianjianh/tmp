[SN]TITLE[SN]
Urban arts centre plan signed for Grangetown, Cardiff

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A deal has been signed which aims to take forward a Â£4m arts and small business complex in Victorian tram sheds near the centre of Cardiff.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A gallery, 40-seat cinema, performance venue and cafe-bar are part of the development, which will be privately-funded by combined living and working spaces as part of the project.
The Grade ll-listed ex-council depot in Grangetown went on sale two years ago.
Councillors hope for 150 jobs and a link up with city centre regeneration.
A community and arts use for part of the building was a stipulation of any agreement and Penarth-based TS Developments signed a lease on Friday.
Plans are due to be submitted and the hope is to have the building up and running by the end of 2015.
