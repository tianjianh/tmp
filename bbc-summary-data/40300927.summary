[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Planning officers have been given the go-ahead to make owners of a Vale of Glamorgan funfair pull down an extension.

Barry Island Pleasure Park owners added the extension to the Treasure Island and Funfair arcade without proper authority, council planners said.
Park owner Henry Danter had said: "I think we're within our rights."
But the council's planning committee approved enforcement action on Thursday.
This orders the removal of the building, frame and all associated materials and to "restore the land and perimeter wall to their former condition".
A council spokesman said: "We would hope the owner would engage with us and put it right voluntarily without us having to take further legal action."
The extension is about 540 sq m (5,800 sq ft) and described as having "a run-down appearance" while the "quality of workmanship and materials is also questionable, with evidence of some inappropriate repairs".
A report given to the planning committee also said: "No planning application has been made to date despite recent reminders."
Mr Danter, who took over the park in 2015, said on Sunday: "I don't think we need planning permission. If they think this is detrimental to Barry, they must be joking."
The fairground was once used to film scenes for the BBC comedy, Gavin and Stacey.
