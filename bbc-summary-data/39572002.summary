Cheshire East Council suspend chief executive during investigation

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A council boss has been suspended while an independent investigation into his conduct takes place.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Cheshire East Council said the suspension of chief executive Mike Suarez after a disciplinary committee meeting on Monday was a "neutral act".
The Conservative-run authority will not reveal details of the allegations.
Councillor Howard Murray said the suspension was "a neutral act taken in the interests of both the council and chief executive".
The chair of the investigation and disciplinary committee added: "It is important that this investigation is undertaken objectively and therefore it would be inappropriate to make any further comment at this stage."
