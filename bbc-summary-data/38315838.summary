'Pampered' Corwen turkeys raised on classical music

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Turkeys raised to classical music and fed a home-grown grain mix may be north Wales' "most pampered".

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The free range turkeys and geese at Lord Newborough's Rhug Estate near Corwen are rounded-up by specially-trained collie dogs each night.
They then enjoy a stress-free sleep in their Dee Valley sheds.
More than 1,000 will take centre stage for Christmas meals in high-end restaurants in Europe, Hong Kong, Dubai, Singapore and Macau.
They include the Four Seasons in Park Lane, Sally Clarke's in Kensington and Shangri La at The Shard, plus Raymond Blanc's Le Manoir Cookery School at Oxford.
Workers on the estate believe they could be the most pampered in north Wales.
Lord Newborough said: "They are free range during the day and tucked up safely at night.
"We have, on occasion, played them classical music as chicks because it is important they have no stress in their lives."
