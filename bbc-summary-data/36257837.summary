The local authority hopes to eventually offer homes to 25 to 30 families fleeing conflict in Syria.
Like other Scottish authorities, it has been working with Scottish councils body Cosla on resettling families.
Highland Council announced the imminent arrival of the first four families at a press conference in Dingwall.
They will be housed in the Alness area of Ross-shire.
Council leader Margaret Davidson said: "I am pleased that we are now ready to welcome the first Syrian refugees to Highland.
"Along with our partners, we have identified the Alness area as the best suited location in which currently available housing, schooling and health support can be provided together with shared and accessible interpretation services."
The Home Office and Department for International Development are covering the cost of resettling refugees across the UK.
The Scottish Refugee Council has organised training for front line support staff and volunteers who will be involved in welcoming and working with the Syrian families.
Mhairi Wylie, chief officer at Highland Third Sector Interface said: "I'm incredibly proud to have been given the chance to be part of the Highland response to this horrific humanitarian crisis.
"Our volunteers have demonstrated an outstanding commitment to really showcasing the best of Highland hospitality, ensuring that these families can come here and experience a future in one of the safest, most beautiful and welcoming areas of the UK."
