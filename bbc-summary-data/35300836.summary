Storm-damaged Frosterley Bridge reopens after damage inspection

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A bridge closed after being damaged in floods, forcing drivers to go on a 10-mile detour, has reopened.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The village of Frosterley in Durham was split in two after the River Wear burst its banks three weeks ago.
Durham County County said it had had to wait until the river level fell so workers could remove fallen trees and divers could inspect the structure.
The bridge passed the safety inspection and has now reopened to the public, the council said.
