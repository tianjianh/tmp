Kevin Johnstone, of Llanelli, slipped amphetamine into Tony Jones's drink while they were working on a building site, Swansea Crown Court heard.
Mr Jones was taken to hospital complaining of heart pain.
Johnstone, 41, pleaded guilty to unlawfully and maliciously causing amphetamines to be administered and was warned he could be jailed.
The court heard Johnstone thought it would be "a good joke" to watch his colleague react to the drug.
Prosecutor Helen Randall said he offered to make his colleague a cup of hot chocolate, put some amphetamines into the drink, stirred it in and then handed it to him.
"Soon after finishing his drink the victim complained of feeling unwell and that his 'heart was racing'," she said.
Defence barrister James Jenkins said Mr Jones's condition "was not life threatening at anytime".
"It's a joke that went wrong. It wasn't intended to do any harm. He now realises, like anyone would, that there is no humour in it," he added.
Recorder Elwen Evans QC warned Johnstone he is likely to face prison.
He was remanded in custody and will be sentenced on Wednesday.
