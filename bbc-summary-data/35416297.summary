The 30-year-old striker scored in extra time to knock out League One side Forfar Athletic as Rose became the first junior side to reach the last 16.
"Some of the boys haven't played senior football and it will be happy days," Kelbie told BBC Scotland.
"We have just got to look forward to it. It's just another game basically."
Kelbie has himself tasted Scotland's senior game with Alloa Athletic, Greenock Morton and Stirling Albion.
But, since 2012, he has been competing in the separate Scottish Junior Football League system and spent the last two seasons with Linlithgow in the East Superleague.
"We'll just take each game as it comes and the most important thing is the game on Saturday now," said Kelbie.
"It will be back to training on Thursday night and preparing for the Scottish Junior Cup - a replay away to Irvine Meadow.
"This will do us the world of good and we'll get a bit of fitness out of it too."
Rose have beaten Gala Fairydean Rovers of the Lowland League, Highland League sides Clachnaccudin and Wick Academy, having been drawn away from home in each round, then Forfar from League One.
Asked if the West Lothian side could overcome the odds again against the side sitting fifth in the top flight, Kelbie laughed before saying: "Let's be realistic here. We'll take the next game as it comes.
"It is an experience for a lot of boys and we'll go and enjoy it. There's no pressure on us."
Kelbie, who also had spells in Northern Irish football with Glentoran, Ballymena United and Glenavon after a sports scholarship at Northern Oklahoma College, had a couple of chances to score before his winning goal.
"I thought it had maybe slipped past us," he admitted. "I think everybody in the stadium thought it was going to penalties.
"In the second half, I cracked one off the post and I thought it was going in.
"You've just got to keep digging in and chances will come. Luckily enough, we got the wee breakthrough - happy days.
"It was a good game to watch - end to end - and luckily enough we got the victory."
