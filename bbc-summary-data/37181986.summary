[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A 31-year-old Aboriginal man has died in custody at a prison in Darwin.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Guards discovered the man's body in his cell just before 6:30 AEST (21:30 GMT) and attempts to resuscitate him were not successful.
Police are investigating the circumstances of the death and will prepare a report for the coroner.
The corrections department said foul play was not suspected and counselling would be available to the man's family, inmates and prison staff.
Indigenous people represent about 3% of Australia's population but have imprisonment rates around 12 times higher than the rest of the country.
