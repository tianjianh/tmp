Newport County's Paul Bignot loses appeal against ban for 'biting'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Newport County defender Paul Bignot has lost his appeal against a six-match ban for allegedly biting an opponent.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The incident took place in the 2-2 League Two draw against Cheltenham Town on 10 September at Rodney Parade.
Bignot, 30, was fined Â£600 and warned about his future conduct following an FA charge of violent conduct.
Bignot, whose ban was suspended pending an appeal, attended a personal hearing on Wednesday and had denied the charge.
Newport's Joss Labadie was banned for six months for biting last year, when he played for fellow League Two side Dagenham and Redbridge.
Bottom-of-the-table Newport are unbeaten in four matches under new boss Graham Westley.
