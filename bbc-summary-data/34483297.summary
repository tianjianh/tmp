[SN]TITLE[SN]
Bristol City 2-0 Nottingham Forest

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Aaron Wilbraham struck twice in the opening 11 minutes to give Bristol City victory over Nottingham Forest.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The home side went ahead when Wilbraham's deflected shot squeezed past goalkeeper Dorus de Vries.
The 35-year-old doubled their lead moments later, heading Derek Williams's left-wing cross into the corner.
Henri Lansbury's volley struck the post for Forest, while De Vries twice denied Wilbraham a hat-trick, but City held on for their first home win of the season.
The Robins, whose last win at Ashton Gate was a thumping 8-2 victory over Walsall on the final day of 2014-15, have now moved off the foot of the Championship table and up to 19th.
Dougie Freedman's side, currently enduring an "unbelievable" injury crisis, remain in 14th having gone four matches without a win.
They got off to the worst possible start at Ashton Gate, with Wilbraham scoring his third and fourth goals of the season in quick succession to put City in command.
Jack Hobbs's header forced Frank Fielding into an eye-catching one-handed save, while Lansbury's spectacular dipping effort almost dragged Forest back into the game after the break.
At the other end, the hosts would have extended their lead only for De Vries' superb double save to deny Wilbraham a first hat-trick in nearly seven years.
But they finished the stronger to secure only their second victory of the season.
Bristol City manager Steve Cotterill:
"We never deserved to be bottom of the table because we have played like that in other games this season and been punished for errors.
"Looking at the table over the last fortnight has made us angry, rather than despondent, and tonight brought the reaction I expected.
"It was a really good team performance. I have a great group of lads who give everything and enjoy the way we play, but we are still adapting to Championship football.
"Aaron Wilbraham is 35 going on 36 and when you have been battered by big centre-backs for as long as he has you are not going to do everything right. But he was superb tonight and should have had a hat-trick."
