The Frenchman, 32, effectively needed to finish in the top three to secure the crown on Sunday, but held off Spaniard Dani Sordo to comfortably earn his fifth race win of the season.
"To be champion two rallies before the end again is great. I can't do much more," said Volkswagen's Ogier.
Ogier finished 15.6 seconds clear, with Belgium's Thierry Neuville third.
