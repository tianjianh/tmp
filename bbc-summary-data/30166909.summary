The 27-year-old 400m hurdler from Perth was presented with four major medals in 2014, including European gold and Commonwealth silver.
And she finished second in the overall Diamond League programme.
Libby Clegg, Mark Dry, Chris O'Hare, Lynsey Sharp were the others short-listed, with Sharp named Commonwealth Athlete of the Year.
The 800m runner, who won the top prize from scottishathletics in 2011 and 2012, was a silver medallist at Glasgow 2014, turning in a memorable performance following a bout of illness.
"I'm thrilled to win this award and especially so when you look at the quality of performances by the five athletes on the short-list," said Child, who picked up relay bronze medals at the European Championships and World Indoors.
"It has been a special year for the sport in Scotland and for me personally.
"I keep being asked for my highlights and really there are two in a photo-finish - the lap of honour at Hampden after silver in the Commonwealth Games and standing on top of the podium in Zurich for my European gold."
Clegg won the Para Athlete of the Year award with World Juniors finalist, hammer thrower Kimberley Reed, winning Under-20 Athlete of the Year.
