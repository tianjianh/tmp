Grayson Perry house: Congestion problems in Wrabness

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A rise in visitors to Grayson Perry's Essex "dream house" has led to one villager creating a home-made sign to warn about traffic congestion.

The artist designed the house overlooking the Stour estuary at Wrabness and it featured in a Channel 4 programme last week.
Visitors have been driving down the narrow track leading to the house - causing problems for neighbours.
Tony Elliston has made a sign asking people to park at the railway station.
Carlo Guglielmi, Essex county councillor for Tendring Rural West, praised Mr Elliston for "taking the initiative" but added official signs were on their way.
Perry's conceptual holiday home has been built by Fat Architects at the end of a single-vehicle road called Black Boy Lane.
The artist, from Chelmsford, designed the building in homage to "single mums in Dagenham, hairdressers in Colchester and the landscape and history of Essex".
Mr Elliston, who manages Wrabness's community shop and cafe, said there had been a "noticeable rise" in visitors since the Grayson Perry's Dream House television programme.
"I think most people in the village like Grayson's house and we're more than happy to welcome visitors," he said.
"But the narrow track has no turning circle, so neighbours are getting frustrated about people using their driveways and there's congestion when cars are coming from both directions."
Essex Highways agreed to carry out works to relieve the situation in February.
Mr Guglielmi said the council had waited until resurfacing work on the village ring road was completed in the first week of May before putting in signs.
"We do accept clearer signs are needed and a whole lot of signs have been agreed - so I will be chasing the firm appointed by the council to find out when they're due," he said.
