Managers have a "ludicrous" lifespan in football, says Hull boss Steve Bruce.

Louis van Gaal became the 56th manager to be sacked in England's top four divisions this season when he was dismissed by Manchester United.
"Football is a changing world and the one thing about managers now is we get used to getting the sack," said Bruce.
The former Manchester United captain, now managing his seventh club, added: "The lifespan of a manager is 13-14 months, which is ludicrous isn't it?"
Speaking to BBC Radio 4 earlier in May, League Managers Association boss Richard Bevan said the 2015-16 campaign had been "the worst season ever" for managerial departures.
He claimed 54 managers had been sacked at that point. Since that interview, Blackpool have dismissed Neil McDonald and Van Gaal has left Old Trafford.
"Always when a manager loses his job, whether it's Louis van Gaal or even Jose Mourinho this year, then you wonder how crazy the world is," said Bruce.
Bruce will oversee his 201st match in charge of Hull when they take on Sheffield Wednesday in Saturday's Championship play-off final at Wembley.
