£1.2m project to improve Glangwili hospital maternity care

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Plans to improve the maternity and neonatal unit at Carmarthenshire's Glangwili hospital are being pushed forward.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Officials have been awarded £1.2m by the Welsh Government to develop a business case to pave the way for the second phase of improvements at the hospital in Carmarthen.
It was upgraded after a report into facilities at the labour ward in 2015.
A successful business case would secure funding for more improvements.
