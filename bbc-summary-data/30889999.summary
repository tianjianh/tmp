FA Cup predictions: Lawro v Cambridge legend Dion Dublin

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
BBC Sport's football expert Mark Lawrenson is pitting his wits against a different guest each week this season.

Lawro's opponent for FA Cup fourth-round weekend is former Cambridge United and Manchester United striker Dion Dublin.

Dublin made his name as a striker with the U's, who sold him to United for Â£1m in 1992. He believed that Cambridge, who are mid-table in League Two and the lowest ranked side left in the competition, had a chance against the 11-time winners. And he was right!
"Anything can happen," Dublin told BBC Sport before the game. "There is always a chance in the FA Cup, there's always a twist.
"I don't think Cambridge will win the tie, best scenario is to get a draw. Underdogs do tend to find a few extra percent against teams like Manchester United."
How right he was as the sides battled out a goalless draw in front of the BBC cameras.
* Dion specified a scoreline, but declined to pick a winner. However, he says he wants a draw.

A correct result (picking a win, draw or defeat) is worth ONE point. Getting the exact score correct earns THREE points.
Last week, Lawro got four correct results from 10 Premier League games, with no perfect scores.
His score of four points was beaten by comedian Seann Walsh, who picked five correct results, with one perfect score for a total of seven points.
