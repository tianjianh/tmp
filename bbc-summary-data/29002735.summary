Tony Charlery, 59, was stabbed in the neck as he tried to "run away from his attackers" on Portobello Road in Notting Hill.
The emergency services were called late on Friday to reports of a stabbing but the grandfather died at the scene in the early hours of Saturday.
A murder investigation has been launched. No arrests have been made.
Det Ch Insp Nicola Wall said: "On Friday 29 August, Tony went alone to the Mau Mau bar in Portobello Road W11.
"He was only inside the venue for a short while and was stabbed as he left. Tony received the fatal wound as he tried to run away from his attackers.
"Tony was a local man and a much loved grandfather. His family are devastated by his death in such a brutal way."
The officer believes two local men were involved in the killing and appealed to the community to come forward with information.
Post-mortem tests revealed Mr Charlery was killed by a stab wound to the neck.
