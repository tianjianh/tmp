An estimated crowd of 120,000 attended the Scottish Airshow on Saturday after it was given the go-ahead following the Shoreham tragedy.

Organisers considered cancelling the weekend event in Ayr after a Hawker Hunter plane crashed during the Shoreham Airshow on 22 August.
A total of 11 people were killed in the incident.
But it was later decided that the Scottish event was in line with new Civil Aviation Authority restrictions.
Crowds gathered at Low Green to watch a series of displays from aircraft including the Red Arrows, Spitfires and one of the final Scottish flights of a Vulcan jet.
Doug Maclean, from The Airshow Scotland Ltd, said: "It has been absolutely phenomenal.
"From talking to the stewards and looking at our photos we think around 120,000 people were here throughout the day, double the number last year.
"It was a great family atmosphere, the weather was terrific and the planes were fantastic."
Mr Maclean said he believed the Shoreham tragedy may have led to a larger crowd turning out to support the Scottish Airshow.
"At so many airshows across the country recently there have been record attendances," he said.
"I think the public want to show their support for this type of event.
"There was no suggestion for a minute that things would be unsafe here, there is a great deal of care and it was just a fantastic day."
Concerns had also been raised by police over a Royal Marine land display at the airshow but it went ahead after the event was "slightly revised" earlier in the week.
Senior officers had objected to the marines being armed during the display at Low Green.
It was agreed with Police Scotland and South Ayrshire Council that there would be no rapid gunfire and planned explosions were scaled back.
The airshow continues on Sunday at Prestwick Airport, with a number of planes on ground display and the return of the Red Arrows.
