Lessons must be learned to make sure Wales can respond more effectively to flooding, the leader of Gwynedd council has said.

Dyfed Edwards was speaking as local authorities recover from the wettest December on record.
"We need to be proactive, we cannot have any delays when we've got circumstances like this," he said.
Natural Resources Minister Carl Sargeant rejected any suggestion Wales was under-prepared for the flooding.
Mr Edwards told BBC Wales' Sunday Politics Wales: "We need to be able to press that button immediately.
"I think the danger for the Welsh government and all of us in government at whatever level is that we react to things continually. There's a crisis, we react to it.
"We must ensure that we take a step back and look. Do we have the infrastructure, are our defences correct, do we have the supports in place to be able to be proactive and to also help people when these circumstances occur?"
Mr Sargeant said teams had worked hard to ensure the resilience of the county was at its best,
"We will continue to make sure our communities are resilient for the future," he said.
The Welsh government has pledged Â£3.3m to help pay for repair and maintenance work.
