Hassan Abdi Mohamed, 48, from Harlow, was found collapsed on a path close to Holly Field in the town last Saturday at 10:45 GMT.
He died from a single stab wound to the chest.
An 18-year-old man from North London was arrested in Edmonton on Friday night.
Magistrates have granted officers an extension for him to remain in custody for a further 36 hours.
Detectives believe Mr Mohammed had been walking along the pathway that leads from Southern Way to Pyenest Road shortly before he was attacked.
His partner, who police have not named, paid tribute to him, saying what happened to "our beloved Hassan" was a "complete shock."
"He was a loving father to our two gorgeous children, who adored him," she added.
Officers confirmed they are still searching for the murder weapon, which is thought to be a large knife.
