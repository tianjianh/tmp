[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Police have promised an increased presence during the Borders festival season after catching a string of drink and drug drivers in the region.

The warning has been issued after 10 people were reported to the procurator fiscal in May.
Police said they would monitor all routes through the region and offenders would be dealt with "robustly".
They added that they would be stepping up operations during the common riding celebrations throughout the Borders.
Insp John Scott said: "Ten people caught driving while drunk or under the influence of drugs is 10 too many and represents a complete disregard for the safety of other road users, as well as their own well-being.
"The public regularly report their suspicions about people they believe are committing offences of this nature and whenever we receive these calls we will respond accordingly.
"With the start of the summer and the Borders festival season upon us, we will have increased road policing patrols in place across the road network and our message is simple - do not drive if you have been drinking alcohol.
"The limit in Scotland has reduced, so don't risk it."
He also encouraged people to continue to report anyone they suspected of drink or drug driving.
