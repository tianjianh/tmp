Former coach Iestyn Harris believes Tyson Frizell will not play for the Wales rugby league team again.

The 24-year-old is in Australia's squad for the Four Nations, having been born there to a Welsh father.
"He's become one of the leading NRL players. Unfortunately for Wales I think we've seen the last of Tyson," Harris told BBC Wales.
Frizell is eligible for Wales because they are a tier-two nation while the Kangaroos are in the top tier.
Players for tier two nations - teams ranked fourth to 10th in the world - can also compete, where eligible, for one of the big three nations, Australia, England and New Zealand.

Prop Evans set to miss Wales' autumn games
Frizell was left out of the Wales squad for the 2017 World Cup qualifiers with Serbia and Italy in October, after telling coaching staff he was unavailable for selection.
He was one of seven new names in Australia's squad.
They face Scotland in their opening game at Hull Kingston Rovers' Lightstream Stadium on 28 October.
Wales will also be without Super League players Rhys Evans and Ben Flower when they face Italy and Serbia.
Warrington Wolves' Evans and Flower of Wigan Warriors face each other in Saturday's Grand Final at Old Trafford.
The duo players had been named in an initial 29-man training squad, but made themselves unavailable due to club commitments.
Former dual-code international Harris said: "They are going to be missed.
"Ben Flower and Rhys Evans are both integral parts of what Wales rugby league are trying to attempting to do in the 2017 World Cup.
Know someone who volunteers in sport and deserves recognition for their efforts? Give them the chance to shine by nominating them.
"It's just unfortunate on this occasion they won't be able to perform for Wales."
He also says the Grand Final will rest on whether Wolves' attacking expertise will be able to overcome Warriors' renowned defence.
"I think it's going to be a closely contested challenge," said Harris.
"You've got Warrington Wolves who are by far the best attacking team in Super League this year and have set it alight at times this season - they can score tries from anywhere - against arguably the best defensive side this year in Wigan Warriors."
