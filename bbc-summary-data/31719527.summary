[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A major redevelopment of Cardiff central station and plans to electrify the north Wales main line are amongst Network Rail's ambitions for the next 30 years.

The Welsh Route Study forecasts rail travel into the Welsh capital will grow from 13m to 33m by 2043.
Its proposals aim to meet that future demand and improve connectivity across the country.
Plans include increasing line speeds and expanding capacity on services.
Potential development options include:
Level crossings could also be closed in west Wales, there could be a new interchange station at Shotton, Flintshire, and improved line speeds on the north Wales coast main line and relief routes between Severn Tunnel Junction and Cardiff.
Tim James, head of strategy and planning for Network Rail Wales, said passenger numbers would continue to increase and while work over the next five years, including line electrification and signalling would improve reliability and the potential for more and faster journeys, there was still more to do to meet demand.
Members of the public can comment on the study until a consultation on the plan ends on 9 June.
