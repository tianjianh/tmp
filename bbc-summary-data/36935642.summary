[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The brother of late comedian Victoria Wood is appealing for support to pay for a statue of her.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Chris Foote Wood aims to raise Â£20,000 for the memorial to his sister, who died in April from cancer.
He wants to erect the tribute in Bury, Greater Manchester, where they grew up.
Mr Foote Wood, who lives in Darlington, said he was sure the statue would be "very, very popular and much appreciated".
"People like to have their photographs taken with their heroes," he said.
"I've always been a big, big fan of Victoria. I'm absolutely in awe of her all her talent - it far out-passes the modest talent that I have - but even I was surprised by the tremendous feeling there was when Victoria died."
The 62-year-old Bafta award-winning comedian, OBE and CBE, was born in Prestwich in Lancashire but lived in Bury until she was 18.
Mr Foote Wood, also a performer and writer, said the statue had the support of Bury Council which he was planning to meet to discuss sites in the town centre.
He suggested the statue could show his sister "in typical pose" seated at the piano or in the form of her character "Kimberley's friend", in mackintosh and beret.
But he said he was open to ideas and it would be decided by public vote.
