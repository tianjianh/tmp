Al Ahly chairman backs Hossam Ghaly to play for Egypt again

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Al Ahly chairman Mahmoud Taher is backing Hossam Ghaly to return to play for Egypt, now that a row the player had with a national team assistant coach has been resolved.

Ghaly is not in Egypt coach Hector Cuper's squad for June's Africa Cup of Nations qualifier against Tanzania.
The omission of the Ahly captain follows reports of an argument with assistant coach Osama Nabeh in March.
"The problem between Osama Nabeh and Hossam Ghaly has ended," Taher said.
"I held a meeting with Hany Abo Rida - the general supervisor of the Egyptian National team - and we resolved things.
"The meeting was meant to include Ghaly and Nabeh but the player is preparing for a league match on Wednesday.
"Ghaly is one of the most important players in Egypt now and I'm sure he will back in the national team soon."
The 34-year-old, who played for Tottenham Hotspur in England and also had spells in Belgium and Netherlands, has played more than 70 times for Egypt.
The Pharaohs will face Tanzania in Dar es Salaam on 4 June needing just a draw to seal qualification for next year's Nations Cup finals in Gabon.
Cuper has recalled Zamalek's Mohamed Ibrahim and Al Ahly duo Ahmed Fathy and Hossam Ashour.
The Pharaohs are due to begin their training camp on Thursday and were due to play a friendly against DR Congo on 29 May, but that game has since been cancelled.
