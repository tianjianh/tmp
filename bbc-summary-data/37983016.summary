[SN]TITLE[SN]
Maidstone United 0-1 Dagenham & Redbridge

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Dagenham & Redbridge are up to third in the National League after Luke Guttridge's goal gave them a victory at Maidstone.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Corey Whitely fired over in the early stages and although Maidstone twice came close, with Jamar Loza's shot narrowly missing the target and Alex Flisher's free-kick well saved by goalkeeper Elliot Justham, the visitors went ahead.
Whitely was the provider, finding Guttridge in the area to slot past Maidstone goalkeeper Lee Worgan.
Justham again had to come to the Daggers' rescue either side of half-time to first deny Jack Paxman's low strike then Loza, who went through on goal.
The crossbar denied on-loan striker Jordan Maguire-Drew as Dagenham sought to double their lead but they claimed all three points to hand Maidstone a fourth defeat in a row in all competitions.
