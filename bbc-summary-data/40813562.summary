Your Neymar XI: Buy your Premier League summer transfer XI with £200m

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Neymar or four Kyle Walkers? Or how about an entire Premier League XI?

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Armed with £200m - the world record fee Paris St-Germain have paid for Barcelona forward Neymar -  we want you to buy a team made up of Premier League players who have moved this summer.
We've drawn up a list of transfers with various price tags from £75m Romelu Lukaku to Phil 'bargain' Bardsley at £750,000.
Unless you're Rachel Riley, you might need a calculator for this one.
Select your best XI within the £200m limit and tweet us with the results, including your total to #bbcfootball.
After Neymar completed his world-record move to Paris St-Germain, we ask you to spend £200m and pick a team from the Premier League players who have moved this summer.
