More than 100 people have attended a public meeting over plans to build a new prison in Port Talbot.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The proposed site is undeveloped land north west of the former Panasonic factory in Baglan, alongside the M4.
The meeting, held at the town's Aberavon Beach Hotel, was arranged by South Wales West AM Bethan Jenkins to "hear local people's opinions".
People living near the earmarked site raised concerns over its proximity to a care home and housing.
The land is currently a lapwing reserve, the meeting heard.
BBC Wales understands it will be a Category C prison for up to 1,600 prisoners, although that has not been confirmed by the MoJ.
It is part of the UK government's commitment to creating up to 10,000 modern prison places by 2020, backed by Â£1.3bn to transform the estate.
