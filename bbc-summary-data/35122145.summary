Phone hacking: Mirror Group loses appeal over damages

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Mirror Group Newspapers has lost its appeal over damages paid to eight victims of phone hacking.

The company argued the £1.25m it was told to pay in total was "out of all proportion" to the harm done.
In May, Mr Justice Mann awarded damages to eight people including actor Shane Richie and ex-footballer Paul Gascoigne, saying the invasions of privacy were "serious" and "prolonged".
The Mirror Group agreed it should pay but had disputed the amounts.
Lady Justice Arden, Lady Justice Rafferty and Lord Justice Kitchin upheld Mr Justice Mann's judgment in the Court of Appeal.
In court it also emerged there is to be a Victims' Right to Review of the decision on Friday by the Crown Prosecution Service not to charge 10 individuals who worked for Mirror Group Newspapers with phone-hacking offences.
Gerald Shamash, the solicitor for Gascoigne and Alan Yentob, the BBC's former creative director, said his clients were "mightily relieved" with the ruling.
Actress Sadie Frost won the largest compensation payment - £260,250.
Richie, Gascoigne, Mr Yentob, Lucy Taggart, Robert Ashworth, Lauren Alcorn and Shobna Gulati were awarded between £72,500 and £201,250.
The compensation to each exceeded the previous record for a UK privacy case - the £60,000 the News of the World was ordered to pay former Formula 1 boss Max Mosley in 2008.
