[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The largest exhibition of the Queen's clothes and accessories ever shown in Scotland will open at the Palace of Holyroodhouse for her 90th birthday.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The display, being held in Edinburgh from 21 April, has been selected to cover the Queen's life and reign, and includes evening and day wear.
The Queen has her actual birthday on 21 April and her official one in June.
It is one of three separate exhibitions entitled Fashioning a Reign: 90 Years of Style from The Queen's Wardrobe.
The three exhibitions are being held at the monarch's official residences during 2016, each displaying a different selection of outfits.
Exhibitions at Buckingham Palace from 23 July and at Windsor Castle from 17 September will follow.
In total, more than 150 outfits worn by the Queen will be presented across the three sites, many chosen because of their close association with the location.
The Palace of Holyroodhouse has been the setting for many significant official occasions during her reign, including in 1962 when she wore a Hartnell evening gown of pale-blue silk faille for a gala performance of Rob Roy at the Royal Lyceum during the state visit to Scotland of King Olav of Norway.
Sir Norman Hartnell, who first worked for the then Princess Elizabeth in the 1940s, produced many evening dresses in her wardrobe.
The exhibition at Buckingham Palace will present outfits worn from the 1920s to the 2010s from ceremonial and military attire to ensembles worn at family celebrations, such as weddings and christenings.
The Windsor Castle event will bring together outfits from evening gowns and elegant day wear to fancy-dress costumes worn by the young Princess Elizabeth for wartime family pantomimes.
