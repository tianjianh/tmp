An elderly man who was kicked 18 times in a row during an unprovoked assault has said he forgives his attacker.

The 77-year-old was the victim of an attack by Shane Gull, who has been sentenced to seven years in prison.
Gull punched him in the head outside a newsagent's in Ipswich on 19 March last year at 07:30 GMT.
His victim, who is called Tony, fell to the ground before he was repeatedly kicked in the head and body.
He sustained a cut to his head, swelling to his face and bruised hands during the attack, which was caught on CCTV.
Tony, who does not want to reveal his surname, said his attacker "needs help" before adding: "He certainly needs some care and attention mentally."
"I basically have forgiven him. I just carry on with life the same as before, you can't let it get you down," he told BBC Radio Suffolk.
Gull, 41, of Bull Road, was charged with causing grievous bodily harm with intent over the attack in Sailmakers shopping centre, which was then called Tower Ramparts.
He pleaded guilty at Ipswich Crown Court, where he was told his sentence would have an extended licence period of five years.
Police said Gull showed "no remorse whatsoever" when he was shown photos of his victim's injuries.
Tony said he was thankful that he did not turn his back during the attack because his "liver and kidneys would never have recovered."
The following day he said he stood "in the same place doing the same thing, just with a few more bruises".
"I've just taken it in my stride, I surprise myself sometimes," he added.
Det Ch Insp Barry Byford said Gull was "completely unrepentant of his actions".
"This is an extremely disturbing unprovoked attack where an elderly man was viciously assaulted in a public place."
