Cardiff City have held talks with top scorer Kenneth Zohore about extending the striker's contract.

Zohore, 23, has scored 13 goals this season having joined from Belgian club KV Kortrijk in the summer of 2016.
"I've spoken to him a few times in the last few weeks," said Bluebirds manager Neil Warnock.
Cardiff are also discussing a new contract for winger Kadeem Harris, whose current deal expires at the end of the campaign.
"I think it's in his [Harris'] best interests to stay and play for someone who will give him an opportunity," said Warnock.
"We've had discussions, quite healthy ones. "I think he's improved under me, and become more of a regular.
"The opportunity is there for him to try and establish himself.
"He's had a few years of him not being able to command a position. The opportunity is there for him to decide."
Harris joined Cardiff from Wycombe as an 18-year-old in 2012 and initially found it difficult to establish himself in the first team.
Now 23, he has enjoyed a breakthrough season, making 37 appearances in all competitions - the most he has made in any single campaign throughout his career.
Warnock is also hopeful that fellow winger Junior Hoilett will extend his stay having signed on a free transfer in October.
The Canadian's contract expires at the end of the season too, but Warnock says he has "no worries" about the former Queens Park Rangers player staying at Cardiff City Stadium.
Warnock was less certain when asked about the future of midfielder Peter Whittingham, another player whose contract expires at the end of the season.
As one of the club's top earners, Whittingham has previously been asked to take a pay cut if he is to extend his record as the Bluebirds' current longest-serving player.
"Nothing's changed. I've not spoken to Peter or his advisors for three or four weeks," said Warnock.
"We decided to get games out of the way and have a little bit more time, when we won't be training for a few weeks other than just ticking over.
"Not just Peter, I'll speak to a quite a number of players the week after the season ends."
The situation also remains unchanged with centre-back Bruno Ecuele Manga, who Warnock has previously said is doubtful of staying at Cardiff and has even said he has a replacement lined-up for.
The Gabon international is another of the highest earners at the club and his contract is also up at the end of this season.
"Nothing has changed. I'm actually seeing his agent this afternoon (Thursday)... so I'll know more about him later on," said Warnock.
"I only want to talk to him to know if there's an opportunity [of him staying]. I know Bruno is happy here, it depends if there are offers from abroad."
