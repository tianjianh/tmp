Mobile phone footage has been released showing two would-be robbers making a slow getaway as they left a bank empty-handed.

One of the men can be seen calmly putting his seatbelt on as his accomplice diligently flicks on his right indicator before driving off.
One viewer commented on Facebook: "They don't look very fit! Shouldn't have much trouble catching them."
It happened at Nationwide in Wigston, Leicestershire, on 11 May.
Leicestershire Police said they were called to the branch in Leicester Road at 11:15 BST after a report of an attempted robbery.
The two men had entered the building and threatened staff, and one of them was brandishing what has been described as a knife.
The footage was captured by a quick-thinking member of the public.
Det Con Eliot Burgess said: "We hope by releasing the footage someone may remember seeing something of significance.
"Did you see two people acting suspiciously around the premises or do you recognise the vehicle?"
The raiders left the scene in a dark silvery grey Ford MPV-type vehicle that was displaying false registration plates.
