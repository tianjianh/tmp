Mohammad Amir has promised to respect the Pakistan team's honour after being selected for a national camp in the next stage of his return from a ban.

The 23-year-old left-arm fast bowler was jailed and banned from cricket for five years for his part in spot-fixing during Pakistan's 2010 tour of England.
He returned to action in March after the sanction was reduced by a year.
"I promise that I will do my best to respect the prestige of the green cap and Pakistan shirt," Amir said.
Amir made his Test debut aged 17 and took 51 wickets in 14 matches before his suspension for offences during the fourth Test against England at Lord's.
His return was opposed by some current players, including former Twenty20 skipper Mohammad Hafeez, who said he would not play in the same team as Amir.
Amir said he hoped he could win them over "with my performances and with my acts".
The 26 players selected for the fitness camp will be eligible for team's limited over series in New Zealand starting next month, which features three one-day and Twenty20 internationals.
