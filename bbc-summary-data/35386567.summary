The 22-year-old, who came through the youth ranks at Adams Park, made 124 first-team league starts for Wycombe since making his debut in March 2013.
"Matt is one for the future," said R's boss Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink.
"He's big, strong, level-headed, works hard and shows the right mentality. I think we have bought another good asset for the club."
