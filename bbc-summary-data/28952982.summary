One of the world's biggest international law firms is to create over 250 jobs in Belfast.

Chicago-based Baker and McKenzie employs more than 10,000 people, and had annual revenues of more than $2.5bn (£1.5bn) in 2013.
The Belfast back-office operation will employ 70 staff in legal services, and 185 in support roles like IT and billing.
The positions will attract salaries of more than £8m, an average of £31,000.
Invest NI is offering a government support grant of just under £1.3m.
Enterprise Minister Arlene Foster welcomed the investment as a vote of confidence in Northern Ireland and its workforce.
"Baker & McKenzie considered a number of locations around the world but, through the excellent work of Invest NI, and the advocacy of other international investors, including what they heard when they attended the Investment Conference last year, the company chose Northern Ireland," she said.
"I met senior representatives from the firm in Chicago in June during my visit to the US and was able to outline just what Northern Ireland could offer.
"Once again, it was our talented workforce, cost-effective environment and attractive financial support packages that secured the investment for Northern Ireland."
Baker and McKenzie joins two other major firms, Herbert Smith Freehills and Allen and Overy, which have similar operations in Belfast.
The firm has another back-office operation in the Philippines.
