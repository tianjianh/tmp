The fossilised snout of a giant flying reptile unearthed on the Isle of Wight is the first of its kind to be discovered on the island.

The Coloborhynchus remains were found by Will Thurbin, from Niton.
Experts at Dinosaur Isle Museum and the University of Portsmouth confirmed it was the pterosaur's first definite appearance on the Isle of Wight.
Scientists believe it to be about 125 million years old, which could make it the oldest example ever found.
A previous discovery, uncovered during the 19th Century near Cambridge, dates back 100 million years.
Mr Thurbin said: "It is great they have confirmed it as a new type of fossil for the island.
"When I picked it up it was triangular in shape and looked different to other fossils I have found in the past.
"I decided to take it home and have a good look and could see that it was a bone and that there were some teeth in it."
He has since donated the fossil to the museum in Sandown.
Shirley Smart, Isle of Wight Council's executive member for economy and tourism, said: "This find further affirms the importance of dinosaur enthusiasts and their ability to help our knowledge of science progress.
"Without the dedication of people such as Will, Dinosaur Isle Museum would not have many of the fossils in the collections that it does.
"It also helps experts gain a better understanding of what these huge creatures were like."
