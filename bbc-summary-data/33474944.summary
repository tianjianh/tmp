Honey bees created a buzz by swarming around one of the seats at Wolverhampton Wanderers FC.

The Championship club said the bees had gathered in Row B of the Stan Cullis stand at its Molineux stadium.
They were re-homed on Thursday evening by a beekeeper Phil Healey, who is a Wolves season ticket holder.
The club said on Twitter: "We've COMBED through the records and unBEElievably this seat is still free for next season."
Wolves facilities and safety manager, Steve Sutton, said: "We were made aware of a swarm of honey bees who had become attached to a seat in the Stan Cullis Stand and yes - wait for it - it was in Row B!"
The colour of the stadium seats reflect the fact that Wolves play in old gold, but the British Beekeepers' Association said bees were "normally attracted to blues" because of the way they perceive colour in ultraviolet.
Gill Maclean, from the association, added that it was normal for honey bees to swarm at this time of year as they follow a queen in the search for a new home once their hive became overcrowded.
In recent times, the association has received calls to swarms that have stopped on the handlebars of a motorbike, around a deckchair and over a shop shutter.
