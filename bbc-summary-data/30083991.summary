It's probably no surprise but S Club 7 are going back on tour and have announced a series of arena gigs.

The band performed during Friday night's Children In Need, the first time as a seven piece since 2002.
During their career, the group had 11 UK top ten hits, including three number ones.
Speaking about the 2015 tour, Rachel Stevens said: "We went through so much together there will always be that bond there. Even though it had been such a long time, coming back together felt really natural."
Of their comeback performance, Bradley told Newsbeat: "It was amazing. You couldn't ask for a better response from the fans."
Whilst there was a lot of positive reaction, there had been some criticism directed at Jo O'Meara's singing.
But Jo explained that it came down to nerves.
Jo said: "A lot of people were picking out my vocals saying they weren't all that good which, I've got to say, I completely agree with!"
"It's because I was so nervous. More nervous than I've ever been. It's like someone had thrown sand in my mouth. I was shaking from head to toe. Next time I'll do a better job."
The full tour dates are:
Thursday, May 7 - Birmingham LG Arena
Friday, May 8 - Manchester Arena
Saturday, May 9 - Newcastle, Metro Radio Arena
