Cardiff City goalkeeping coach Andy Dibble would like to see Allan McGregor remain at the club beyond the end of the current season.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
McGregor, 35, is on loan from Hull City until the end of the season.
Ex-Wales goalkeeper Dibble is full of praise for the Scotland international, who has made 13 appearances for the Bluebirds.
"He's been absolutely fantastic the way he approaches training and games," Dibble said.
"Yes, we would love to have him long term. That's up to the powers that be with the financial side.
"But he would be one on our radar definitely. He's a model professional."
McGregor had fallen behind Eldin Jakupovic and former Cardiff number one David Marshall in Hull's pecking order before joining Cardiff in January.
