The 29-year-old was a free agent after leaving Sutton's fellow National League side Guiseley at the end of the season.
Manager Paul Doswell told the club website: "He's a quality holding midfielder who's equally comfortable at centre-half.
"He has a great passing range, will bring a winning mentality, and provides another leader in our dressing room."
