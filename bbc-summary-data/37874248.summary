The 81-year-old BBC football pundit, treated for Non-Hodgkin lymphoma in 2007, is undergoing daily radiotherapy.
Armfield, awarded a CBE in 2010, won 43 caps and made a club record 568 appearances for Blackpool, going on to manage Bolton and Leeds United.
"It is nowhere near as evasive as last time," he told the Blackpool Gazette.
"I finish the treatment this weekend and the consultant who I am seeing again seems confident."
Armfield, who commentates for BBC Radio 5 live, says he had surgery after developing health problems in September, but did not give details of his illness.
"I am better now than I have been for over a month," he added. "It is amazing how quickly medicine has moved on, and I am thankful for that.
"I don't feel poorly - I can get out and about, go shopping and go for a walk."
