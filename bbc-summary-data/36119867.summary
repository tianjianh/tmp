Police said a "scruffy" white man in his 40s approached the girl on Love Lane at 15:30 BST on Friday, close to Trinity School.
Officers said they were "keeping an open mind" about a possible link with the attempted abduction of an eight-year-old girl on Tuesday.
The girl was cycling on Owen Road when a woman in a car grabbed her arm.
Thames Valley Police have said there were "extra patrols" in the area.
Det Con Snezhanna Lennon said: "This was a frightening experience for the victim."
