An exhibition dedicated to Tim Peake's mission to the International Space Station is to open on the first anniversary of his take-off.

A permanent display has been created at the Novium Museum in Chichester, West Sussex, which is near his family home.
Visitors will learn about experiments he carried out after setting off on his six-month mission on 15 December 2015.
The astronaut's father, Nigel, helped curate the exhibition and said he was "delighted to be involved".
He said: "The manager of the museum very kindly invited me along to join the steering group and explained what they hoped to do.
"I passed the suggestion through Tim, who thought it was a good idea.
"Really, it's just to put the personal touches in and some of the background."
The exhibition is opening exactly a year since Major Peake blasted off in a Soyuz rocket from the launch site in Kazakhstan.
A museum spokeswoman said visitors would be able to "experience Tim's mission first-hand".
She said: "They can discover what it's like to live in space, from eating, sleeping to even exercising in the International Space Station."
Tim Peake was the first person to fly to space under the UK banner since Helen Sharman in 1991. He made the first spacewalk by a UK astronaut.
