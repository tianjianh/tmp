An average of almost 13.5 million people have tuned in to each episode of the BBC One competition, according to the research body Barb.
It is the largest number of viewers Bake Off has attracted in its seven-year history.
The ratings include people who recorded the show and then watched it up to seven days after broadcast.
The data covers only the first five episodes of the current series, and does not include the sixth instalment which aired on 28 September.
Other popular shows this year have been ITV's talent show Britain's Got Talent and Euro 2016 matches, with the former as Bake Off's closest competitor.
One episode of the talent show attracted 12.5 million viewers in April, putting it in sixth place.
Channel 4 has signed a three-year deal with Love Productions, which makes The Great British Bake Off, to air the show from 2017.
