[SN]TITLE[SN]
Derby County v Preston North End

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Striker Darren Bent is back in training with Derby and could return to the side after a groin injury and illness ruled him out of the past two games.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The game comes too soon for defender Richard Keogh, who is still recovering from a calf problem.
Preston have problems at right-back with Alex Baptiste, Tyias Browning and Calum Woods (all knee) ruled out.
Marnick Vermijl continues to recover from hernia surgery, so Greg Cunningham and Tom Barkhuizen may fill in again.
