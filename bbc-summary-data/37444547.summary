The club, who play at Charlotte's Bank of America Stadium, are in contact with government officials and police.
North Carolina's governor, Pat McCrory, declared a state of emergency on Thursday after a second night of protests over the death of a black man.
Keith Lamont Scott was shot dead by a black officer on Tuesday.
