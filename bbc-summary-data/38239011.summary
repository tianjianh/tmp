[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 36-year-old Czech national was arrested on Saturday after the body of Rebecca Johnson, 26, was found in the Finnish village of Kuttanen.
Ms Johnson was a member of the Santa Safari team which works with tour operator Transun Travel to organise Christmas-themed excursions to Lapland.
The couple lived in Scotland before moving to the Arctic for seasonal work.
Ms Johnson was from Burntisland in Fife.
A Finnish police statement said: "Lapland District Court has today imprisoned the suspect of the homicide, according to the claim of the Lapland Police Department.
"A 36-year-old Czech citizen is suspected of killing his 26-year-old long-term partner. The victim is a female citizen of Scotland. The crime is investigated as a murder."
It is understood members of Ms Johnson's family have since travelled to Lapland.
The police statement said: "The suspect has been co-operative but hasn't been able to clarify a specific motive for his suspected act.
"Police will continue the investigations by hearing the witnesses and the suspect, and by conducting technical investigations."
The suspect was arrested on Saturday after fleeing into the Lapland wilderness on a dog sled.
The police operation involved a helicopter and officers on snow scooters in temperatures of -30C.
The man was said to have been suffering from hypothermia when he was found.
