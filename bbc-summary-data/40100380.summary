Benefits outweigh the risks when England make players available for the Indian Premier League, says director of cricket Andrew Strauss.

Ben Stokes, who helped England seal the one-day international series against South Africa on Saturday, was rested for Monday's game with an injury.
All-rounder Stokes, 25, has returned from his Â£1.7m stint at Rising Pune Supergiant in the IPL.
"Injuries are part and parcel of the life generally," said Strauss.
Stokes has had two sets of scans on his knee over the past week before the Champions Trophy, which starts on Thursday.
England seamer Chris Woakes, who has also returned from playing for Kolkata Knight Riders in the IPL, sat out two of the three ODIs against South Africa because of tightness in a thigh muscle.
"That is the slight risk you take when you make people available for a chunk of cricket that is outside the international schedule," added Strauss.
"On one hand you weigh up the potential risk and on the other you ask what they can potentially gain from that experience."
