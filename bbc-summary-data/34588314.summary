[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 66-year-old, from Hackballscross in County Louth, denies failing to furnish tax returns between 1996 and 2004.
The prosecution claims he failed to supply tax returns despite making significant cattle and land dealings.
The charges follow an investigations by the Irish Criminal Assets Bureau.
Tom Mulligan, a former project manager at County Meath-based firm Kepak, told the non-jury Special Criminal Court in Dublin that in 2006 he provided police with records of business conducted with Thomas Murphy.
He told a prosecuting barrister that from August 1999 to August 2001, cattle worth more than 30,000 euros were supplied to Kepak by Thomas Murphy.
The court also heard evidence from a former manager at a County Galway livestock mart that in May 2004, a man named Thomas Murphy, with an address at Ballybinaby, Hackballscross, County Louth purchased five cattle, with a total value of 4,737.29 euros (£3,478).
Stephen O'Beirne told the court that an authorised agent paid for the cattle.
Mary Keenan, a manager at Kingscourt Mart in County Cavan, told the court that in May 2004, cattle worth more than 5,000 euros (£3,670) were purchased "on behalf of" Thomas Murphy.
"I've never dealt with Thomas Murphy in person," she told the court.
The trial continues.
