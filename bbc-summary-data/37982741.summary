[SN]TITLE[SN]
Millwall 0-0 AFC Wimbledon

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
AFC Wimbledon extended their unbeaten league run to three games after a goalless draw with London rivals Millwall at the Den.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Dons played more than 15 minutes with 10 men after defender Jon Meades was sent off for a second bookable offence, but a change of shape by manager Neal Ardley secured them a well-earned point.
Former Millwall player Paul Robinson came close for Wimbledon early in the first half but his shot went over the bar.
The game turned feisty after half-time with a number of poorly-timed tackles and Meades picked up his first yellow for a late challenge on David Worrall early in the second half.
Millwall showed signs of frustration at the referee after he dismissed two shouts for penalties, while Wimbledon were forced to make changes after Meades was dismissed in the 74th minute.
Both sides had opportunities to win the game, with the Lions trying to take advantage of their extra man, but neither could find the net and the result saw Wimbledon slip out of the play-off places.
