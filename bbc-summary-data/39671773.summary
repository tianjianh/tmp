[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A "distastefully funny" magazine is being investigated by police over an allegedly racist football report it published about Hull City's owner.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
In its March edition Tenfoot City Magazine used derogatory terms to refer to the Egyptian heritage of the premier league club's owner Assem Allam.
The magazine has denied racism but said its readers expected it to use "typical Hull humour".
The club said the potentially racist comments were "totally unacceptable".
In response it said it had referred the matter to police.
In a statement it said: "We are duty bound to report any incidents of racism and are proud participants in a number of initiatives such as the Kick It Out campaign and are currently undertaking the Premier League Equality Standard.
"This sort of language is not acceptable in football or the wider community."
The article was penned by a reporter under the name of Tenfoot Tiger and sparked an angry response among some readers, such as Roger Coates, a City of Culture volunteer.
He said: "There are three obscene remarks specifically relating to Mr Allam's racial origin."
These included the terms "sand-licker", "pyramid trotter" and a reference to sexual activity with a camel.
Another section of the article referred to the club signing players from overseas and winning "the John Motson trophy for the the most unpronounceable names in the Prem".
A spokesman for the magazine said: ''People should stop being so sensitive and read the rest of the magazine properly."
He said the same edition of the free magazine, which claims to have a circulation of about 30,000, featured articles about helping Hull's refugees and the history of Hull's Rock Against Racism movement.
The magazine's owners said its readers expected it to adopt a "down to earth" approach and to display "smatterings of typical Hull humour".
