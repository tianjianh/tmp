The former Finland international, 41, is currently working as an assistant manager with his national team.
Johansson spent three successful years at Ibrox between 1997 and 2000, scoring 25 times in 71 appearances.
He was chosen by Caixinha ahead of other former Rangers players such as Barry Ferguson, John Brown, Kevin Thomson and Alex Rae.
Johansson, who spent three years in charge of Motherwell's under-20 side between 2012 and 2015, will join Caixinha's right-hand man Helder Baptista, fitness coach Pedro Malta and goalkeeper coach Jose Belman on the Rangers staff.
He won 106 caps for Finland and played in the English Premier League with Charlton Athletic after leaving Ibrox.
Johansson also had a loan period at Norwich City before a two-year spell at Malmo in Sweden.
He returned to Scotland for brief spells with Hibernian and St Johnstone before winding down his playing career at one of his former clubs, TPS, back in Finland.
As a coach, Johansson worked with Greenock Morton's reserves before joining Motherwell and coaching their under-20 side.
