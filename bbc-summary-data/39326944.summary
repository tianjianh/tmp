Eoin Bradley had given Coleraine the lead in the 27th minute by following up to score after his penalty had been parried out by keeper Tim Allen.
The spot-kick was awarded when Bradley had been fouled by Allen.
Third-placed Coleraine looked set to take the three points until McMurray got on the end of a corner to level.
Coleraine are unbeaten in their last 13 matches in all competitions, winning 11 and drawing the other two.
Striker Bradley has now scored seven goals since rejoining the Bannsiders in January.
Ballymena went close to equalising just before half-time when Tony Kane crashed a long-range shot off the crossbar.
United, beaten 4-0 in the Irish Cup the last time the sides met, threatened again in the second half, but a Gary Thompson shot was well blocked by Coleraine's Gareth McConaghie.
The Sky Blues got the leveller when McMurray firmly nodded in his 12th goal of the season from Kane's left-wing corner.
Ballymena manager David Jeffrey: "It was a cracking game of football and for the first 20-25 minutes Coleraine were the better side.
"But we came alive and should have made it 1-1 with Tony Kane's wonderful effort.
"In the second half, if we had taken the chances we created, we would have had the three points, but I am very pleased with the performance."
Coleraine manager Oran Kearney: "We would like to have held on to the 1-0, but on the second half performance Ballymena probably deserved their point.
"We got our goal and have been resolute in defence and the fact that the goal came from a set piece is disappointing."
