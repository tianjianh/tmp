[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Scottish Labour leadership candidate Kezia Dugdale has called for the abolition of the House of Lords and its replacement with an elected second chamber based in Glasgow.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
She said a second chamber of unelected Lords was a "democratic outrage".
The Lothian region MSP said: "We need a second chamber, it should be elected and it can't be in London."
She said she would campaign for Glasgow to be the site of a "democratic and balanced revising chamber".
Ms Dugdale, who is competing against Ken Macintosh for leadership of Scottish Labour, said: "Let me be clear - I want to live in a United Kingdom but I want to shake it up profoundly, and that has to start with the House of Lords."
Her comments come after the SNP called on new Lib Dem leader Tim Farron and Labour leadership candidates to rule out appointing new peers to the House of Lords.
Labour leadership frontrunner Jeremy Corbyn reportedly said he backed a block on nominating new members.
Prime Minister David Cameron is believed to be planning to appoint more Tory peers to the House of Lords.
At present there are 226 Tory peers, 212 Labour, 101 Liberal Democrats and 179 crossbenchers.
The SNP does not take any seats in the Lords on principle.
It was reported on Saturday that Scottish businesswoman Michelle Mone has been lined up to become a Conservative peer.
The Scottish Sun claimed the Ultimo underwear founder was told she will be offered a seat in the House of Lords in a call from Mr Cameron.
