Two tries from Mark Atkinson and one from Matt Scott helped put them 21-6 ahead, before Simon Labouyrie and Dion Evarard Oulai crossed for the hosts.
Billy Twelvetrees' try made it 29-20 at half-time, before Evrard Ourai's second reduced the deficit to just two points.
But May's effort and a late try from Tom Savage earned their side the win.
