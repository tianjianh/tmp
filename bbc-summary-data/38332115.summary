Cardiff council has said it is aware that some of the baubles on a controversial Christmas tree outside Cardiff Castle have been peeling.

Pictures posted to Twitter show some of the tree's baubles damaged.
The structure is costing the council £10,000 a year. Lib Dem councillor Elizabeth Clark called it "expensive tat".
Cardiff council said it is contacting the supplier, MK Illuminations, for a solution.
The structure was installed just three weeks ago.
The council has already had to apologise after the tree - a pre-decorated "tree-shaped structure" ordered from China - turned out to be 40ft and not 40m high as had been expected.
Elizabeth Clark, Lib Dem councillor for Cardiff city centre, said: "The fact that parts of this already ridiculous tree are now breaking and peeling away is beyond belief.
"Cardiff is meant to have this for the next three years, yet it can't even last three weeks.
"It might look like cheap tat, but in reality it's very expensive tat."
The tree is on a three-year lease from UK-based company MK Illuminations.
In 2015, insurance company Admiral sponsored the main tree outside Cardiff Castle, which was up in time for the city's Step Into Christmas event.
A council spokeswoman said: "We are aware of the issue and are contacting the supplier to discuss a solution.
"The City of Cardiff Council has worked hard for many years - despite huge cuts to budgets - to deliver a Christmas offering in the city which both residents and visitors can enjoy alike.
"This year's tree costs £10,000 a year over a three-year lease and will save the council £5,000 per annum based on costs of last year's installation."
A Cardiff Labour group spokesman claimed the Lib Dems, when it had led Cardiff council, had spent £250,000 on Christmas decorations in 2012.
"We have cut that figure to £120,000," he added.
