British shot putter Sophie McKinna has said she struggled for motivation after splitting from coach Geoff Capes.

The 20-year-old and Capes parted company before last year's Commonwealth Games, where McKinna finished fifth, and she is currently without a coach.
"I totally lost the enjoyment. I used to turn up for meetings and not want to be there," she told BBC Radio Norfolk.
"The Commonwealth Games was an amazing experience, but my head wasn't in the right place. But that's now improving."
McKinna recorded Britain's top shot put distance in 2013, with a personal best of 17.12m, a distance that puts her ninth in the UK's all-time list.
But 2014 was a struggle for the Norfolk youngster, who failed to break the 17m mark throughout the year and registered her best throw of 16.59m in July's Commonwealth Games.
The reasons for her split from Capes, a two-time Commonwealth gold medallist, have not been made public, but she has since returned home to Great Yarmouth.
Last weekend, the 2011 World Youth Championships silver medallist finished third at the British Indoor Championships with a 15.15m throw.
"I was hoping to throw over 16m," she said. "Last year was a big adjustment period after leaving my coach. To be even back in the circle competing, I was massively happy.
"The last few months have been really difficult. But I'm just pleased to be back competing and being in a more positive place.
"The World Championships in August may be a bit out there - but you have to set yourselves big targets to achieve big distances and I want to qualify."
