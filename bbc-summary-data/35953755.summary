Over 100 vintage cars, including Sir Malcolm Campbell's record breaking Sunbeam Bluebird, have been taking over the streets of a Herefordshire town.

Hundreds of car enthusiasts have been at Bromyard's Festival of Speed which organisers said is to celebrate the area's motoring history.
The chairmen of the Austin, Bean and Morgan all lived locally and parts for Morgan three wheelers were made there.
The vehicles have paraded through the town and also on display.
Mr Campbell first gained the world speed record in 1924 for travelling at more than 140 mph in a Sunbeam he called Bluebird.
The vehicle has also taken part in the parade, alongside about 120 other vintage and historic cars.
Organisers said the town and its immediate locality has been linked to the British motor industry since the birth of the motor car.
"Automotive engineering was first started in Bromyard by the Pettifer family, who manufactured chassis components for the iconic Morgan Three Wheeler in 1910, prior to the building of the Malvern factories.
"For this, our first year, Morgan who are proud to be the UK's last privately owned motor manufacturer, will be the featured company in line with their special association with Bromyard."
The car maker was founded by HFS Morgan in 1909.
It began producing three wheeler cars in 1910, but the firm's reputation is based on hand-built small sports cars.
