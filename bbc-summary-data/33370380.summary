Trudy Jones, 51, from Blackwood, Caerphilly county, was on holiday with friends when she was gunned down in the resort of Sousse on 26 June.
Her body was flown back to the UK on an RAF aircraft to Brize Norton in Oxfordshire on Thursday.
Hundreds turned out for a remembrance event at the Dragon Circle in her home town from 11:50 BST on Friday.
Islwyn MP Chris Evans said the turnout showed the community's support for Trudy Jones's family.
"I think this is a tragedy beyond comprehension. Going on holiday is something everybody does," he said.
"I can't begin to understand what the family are going through but I hope seeing the turnout here will give them some comfort that everyone in the Blackwood community is thinking of them."
Representatives from local schools, churches, community groups and the council attended to observe the silence at 12:00 BST and to say prayers.
Councils including Cardiff, Caerphilly and Rhondda Cynon Taff also held a silence, and flags on authority buildings were flown at half mast, while people gathered outside St Peter's Church in Carmarthen.
Speaking from Blackwood, Gwent Police and Crime Commissioner Ian Johnston said: "I am really pleased with the amount of people that made it. It shows the support for the family.
"Without meaning to be melodramatic, I think the level of support also shows that terrorists can do what they want but they won't break the British way of life."
Hazel Smith, 73, had known Trudy Jones since she was a child.
"She was so bubbly and full of fun. We are just devastated for her family," Ms Smith said.
"She was really excited about going on holiday, I was talking to her here in town the day before. She was really excited."
After last week's attack, Ms Jones' family described her as a caring person who was always willing to help others.
"She was the rock of our family and kept us all going. None of us have a clue how we're going to cope without her," a statement said.
Ms Jones had been due to fly home two days after the attack to return to work at Highfields Nursing Home, where she was an activity coordinator.
Manager Shawkat Ilahi said staff and residents also remembered her during a silence at the home.
Other Welsh people caught up in the attack include Mathew Davies, 30, from Trehafod, near Pontypridd, who used his body as a human shield to protect his fiancee Saera Wilson, 26.
Rita Williams, from Maesteg, had a lucky escape when one of the gunman's bullets passed through her hat and grazed her head.
