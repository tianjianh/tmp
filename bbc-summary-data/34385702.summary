Unite members at Cardiff Bus suspended pay row strike action earlier this month after a revised deal was offered to the union, but it has now been rejected in a workplace ballot.
A 48-hour strike will begin on Thursday - the day Wales takes on Fiji at the Millennium Stadium at 16:45 BST.
New Zealand v Georgia, at 20:00 on Friday, will also be affected.
The union, which has 540 members at the firm, initially rejected a 5% deal at the start of September but later suspended three days of planned industrial action after Cardiff Bus made what it called an "improved" offer.
On Monday, the firm said it had been rebuffed and, as a result, a "limited" service would be in operation on Thursday and Friday.
Cynthia Ogbonna, managing director of Cardiff Bus, said: "We have continued to work tirelessly to reach a positive resolution for all parties involved and are extremely disappointed that this has not been achieved."
Customers were advised to check the company's website and social media feeds and to call its customer service helpline for further updates.
"We are extremely apologetic for again inconveniencing our customers, and we will do our best to ensure that we keep Cardiff moving during this time," Ms Ogbonna added.
