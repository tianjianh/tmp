Welsh international Owain Fon Williams and his Inverness Caledonian Thistle team-mate Ali Sutherland have personal connections to children's units.
After falling seriously ill as a boy, Fon Williams spent three months in a Welsh children's unit and later Alder Hey Children's Hospital in Liverpool.
Sutherland's girlfriend Dawn Cowie was an inpatient at Raigmore's unit.
She is now a fundraising assistant with Archie Highland, a charity that supports sick children and their families across the north of Scotland.
Fon Williams, who has already got a head start on his team-mate in the facial hair growing stakes, and Sutherland are taking part in the charity's Beards for Bairns challenge.
The goalkeeper and striker will not shave for more than a month from Christmas Day until Burns Night on 25 January.
