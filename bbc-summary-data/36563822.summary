Miller, who scored 16 goals in 43 games last term, is reunited with former Shrimps team-mate Jamie Devitt, who also moved to United this summer.
The 28-year-old has also played for Crewe, Sheffield United, Shrewsbury, Coventry, Crawley and York.
"Shaun is a clever player," said head of recruitment Lee Sykes.
He told the club website: "His connection with Jamie [Devitt] will help both of them with the settling-in process."
