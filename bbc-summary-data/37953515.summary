[SN]TITLE[SN]
Nation Broadcasting radio stations set to relocate

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Three west Wales radio stations are to relocate to Vale of Glamorgan this month, BBC Wales understands.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Nation Broadcasting launched a consultation in September to broadcast Radio Pembrokeshire, Radio Carmarthenshire and Radio Ceredigion from St Hilary, near Cowbridge.
The shows are currently broadcast from studios in Narberth, Pembrokeshire.
The company said details of its operations were "confidential".
Sources have told BBC Wales the relocation will take place this month and some staff have been made redundant.
Martin Mumford, group managing director of Nation Broadcasting, would not confirm the move or the number redundancies, saying "the detail of our operations and staffing arrangements are commercially confidential".
He did confirm two "long-serving presenters" would continue to provide local programming while specialist programmes such as the farming, music and sport shows would continue to be provided from Narberth.
Mr Mumford said the company was "committed to maintaining its status as a leading media employer in west Wales" and had invested in a new digital media business in Narberth, employing five full-time staff.
