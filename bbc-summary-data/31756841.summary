A mother of two who had her lower legs and fingers amputated after developing a range of illnesses has begun rehabilitation to help her walk again.

Tracy Ralph, 35, from Hawkwell, Essex, was admitted to hospital with pneumonia on Christmas Eve and was diagnosed with septicaemia and blood clots.
She has now been transferred from Southend Hospital to a specialist centre in south west London.
A fundraising campaign to help adapt her home has now raised £148,214.
It was started by Tracy's sister-in-law Amanda Ralph with an initial target of £100,000 to help buy "the best prosthetic feet we can".
After nearly £80,000 was raised in four days, the target was reset to £250,000.
Amanda said: "We've been told the prosthetics will only last five years each time, so Tracey will need a lot more over the course of her life."
Tracy was treated for meningitis, septicaemia, blood clots and bleeding on the brain and was put in an induced coma, her sister-in-law said.
After being confined to bed for more than two months, she was admitted to the NHS Douglas Bader Rehabilitation Centre at Queen Mary's Hospital, Roehampton earlier this month.
"Tracy is doing well, she is really determined and has been fitted with legs. The next stage is getting used to using them and working hard at learning to walk again," he sister-in-law continued.
"She is now in her third week, so we are hoping she will be home after eight weeks is up and the house should be ready by then too."
Her family estimate it will cost £60,000 to alter the family home near Rochford for wheelchair access and she would also need to have an adapted car.
The Team TC charity is holding a Help Tracy Back on Her Feet Gala at Rayleigh Golf Club on Friday, 17 April.
