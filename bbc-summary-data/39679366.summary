Courtney Tulloch, 21, won Britain's first major international rings medal with silver at the event in Romania.
Olympic champion Eleftherios Petrounias claimed gold, 0.367 ahead of Tulloch.
Ellie's older sister Becky Downie, 25, was unable to defend her uneven bars title as she fell during her routine and needed medical attention.
Her participation in Sunday's beam final looks in doubt, with fellow Briton Claudia Fragapane set to take her place should she withdraw.

"I mainly just felt gutted for her - she worked so hard and the won I bronze is for her and me," Ellie told BBC Sport.
"The bars bronze was just so unexpected and if Becky had gone through her routine I'm sure she would've knocked me into fourth."
Downie tied for third alongside Eli Seitz of Germany as Belgium's Nina Derwael took gold and Russia's Elena Eremina silver.
It was the third medal for the 17-year-old Briton in as many finals, having also claimed silver in the vault final earlier on Saturday.
Downie produced two solid vaults to lead with an average of 14.350, only to be pipped by the final competitor, Coline Devillard of France, with Hungary's Boglarka Devai in third.
"I was really happy with the vault - I was in first until the last girl and she full deserved it," Downie added.
"Her vaults were definitely tidier than mine so I was happy to let her have that title."

On Friday, Downie became the first British gymnast to win all-around gold at a major international championship and will also compete in the beam and floor finals on Sunday.
Tulloch continued an impressive championships for a largely inexperienced British men's team, which contains none of the competitors from the Rio Olympics, following James Hall's all-around bronze on Friday.
He scored 15.066 to move into second with only one athlete remaining and held on to silver place as Turkey's Ibrahim Colak could only finish fifth, with Ukraine's Igor Radivilov claiming bronze.
