More than 400 cannabis plants with an estimated street value of Â£650,000 were seized from Drakelow Tunnels, near Kidderminster in Worcestershire.
A 45-year-old man has been arrested in a separate dawn raid in Kidderminster.
During the Cold War, the tunnels were designated as the potential site of a regional seat of government in the event of a nuclear attack.
"[Officers] found a network of hydroponic equipment including heating, lighting and ventilation fans," said Supt Kevin Purcell.
The 285,000 sq ft network of tunnels stretches for about three miles and was used in World War Two to house a machine-part factory.
The tunnels were also used by the Ministry of Supply throughout the 1950s for storage, and much of the original equipment is still in place.
More recently plans were revealed by the site's owners to transform the tunnels into a museum.
