Stargazers in the north east and south of Scotland are expected to get the best view of the Perseid meteor shower when it reaches its peak overnight.

Astronomers predict it could be possible to see up to 200 meteors per hour in clear skies.
The best time to view it will be from 23:00 until 04:00 in north Aberdeenshire and Galloway.
Dark, countryside skies away from street lights offer the best possibility of a sighting.
BBC Scotland weather presenter Kawser Quamer said the skies will be mainly cloudy but there is a chance of clearer spells.
She said: "Tonight and early tomorrow is the peak of this year's season, which runs until 24 August.
"The best time to view it is from 23:00 until 04:00 if you look towards the north-eastern sky.
"But it's all dependent on the weather forecast and I'm afraid for tonight it will be rather cloudy.
"In the north east and south of the country there will be drier moments and the possibility of some clearer spells.
"So if you are heading out with a camera, the favoured spots for some clearer spells will likely be across Aberdeenshire, maybe northern Moray and across Angus.
"For Galloway, quite often a favoured spot for stargazers is heading towards Loch Trool."
Perseids are shooting stars or space debris from the Swift-Tuttle comet.
Every year, the Earth passes through this field of debris and it is normally possible to see 100 meteors or shooting stars per hour during the peak.
This year, that could double as experts predict a rare meteor "outburst", according to Armagh Observatory.
