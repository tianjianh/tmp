[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Free agent Taylor, 32, has agreed a two-year deal at the newly-promoted Premier League side, while 23-year-old Sordell joins on a three-year contract.
The fee has not been disclosed for Sordell, who scored eight goals while on loan for Charlton and has been capped 14 times by England Under-21s.
Sordell previously played under Burnley boss Sean Dyche at Watford.
Taylor, who scored three goals in 90 appearances for West Ham before his contract ended in the summer, is another former Bolton player. He was previously at Portsmouth.
The arrivals are the second and third this week for Burnley after announcing on Wednesday that former Blackpool goalkeeper Matt Gilks had joined them.
Another summer signing, Michael Kightly, had been on loan from Stoke last term and has now made the move permanent.
