TAS Racing confirmed on Wednesday that Martin and William Dunlop will ride for them in next year's roads campaign, including the TT and North West 200.
The team will be the German manufacturers' official representatives at all international road races.
"It's a new bike and I've never ridden it before, but we all know its pedigree," said 33-year-old Martin.
The Grimsby racer had contemplated retirement before agreeing the new deal and he added:  "I'll always give it my all and to be with a quality manufacturer like BMW is mega."
The team's schedule will also include the Ulster Grand Prix, plus selected national races.
Dunlop said: "We have a top team and I'm happy to be working with Guy again at the TT, where I think together we can be even stronger with this exciting new package."
The Moneymore-based team ended a 14-year association with Suzuki to team up with the German manufacturer.
And manager Hector Neill said it was a "great honour" to be chosen to spearhead BMW Motorrad's campaign.
Martin achieved two podiums at the 2014 TT, while Dunlop was running in a podium place in the Senior before crashing on the third lap.
