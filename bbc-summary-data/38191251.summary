O'Sullivan dropped just three frames in his first four matches, but Williams held his own, scoring a fine 70 to level at 2-2 at the break.
The Englishman then capitalised on some sloppy play by the Welsh world number 16 to reach the last four.
O'Sullivan, 40, will face Hong Kong's Marco Fu on Saturday.
Fu came from 5-2 down to beat Jamie Jones of Wales 6-5 in the last of the quarter-finals in York.
"It's a bitter pill to swallow," said Jones. "I don't think I missed a lot of balls, I think he just played a bit better than me in the end."
The other semi-final will see world number one Mark Selby take on former world champion Shaun Murphy.
O'Sullivan said he was happy with his "professionalism and attitude", despite not quite hitting the heights.
The five-time world champion still scored three successive 50s, and closed out the win with little trouble after being pegged back at 2-2.

"I made some good breaks and played some good safety to put him under pressure," said O'Sullivan. "I had to keep powering away and I felt like I had too much for him.
"It wasn't the greatest of performances but you have to do what you have to do. I am sure my game will get stronger. I am a fighter and will keep fighting until it happens."
Another tournament victory at the York Barbican, 23 years after he won his first title as a 17-year-old, would see O'Sullivan match Steve Davis' haul of six UK titles.
It would also see him surpass his fellow Essex potter - and John Higgins - in the ranking titles roll of honour, moving him clear into joint second with 29. Stephen Hendry leads the way with 36.
The win also ensures O'Sullivan remains in the top 16 of the world rankings, guaranteeing him at least Â£35,000 for reaching the semi-finals.
