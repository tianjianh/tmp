[SN]TITLE[SN]
Dissident republican parade held in Derry

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
About 2,000 people have attended a dissident republican parade in Londonderry.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
It was organised by Saoradh.
The parade started in the Bogside at Free Derry Corner and made its way into the Creggan estate where a wreath was laid at a republican memorial.
The march included a military-style colour party and six bands, including three from Scotland. The parade ended at the republican plot in Derry City Cemetery with speeches.
The main oration was given by Paul Duffy, a former republican prisoner, and brother of the prominent dissident Colin Duffy.
Paul Duffy said the party wanted to bring an end to British involvement in Ireland.
"These objectives have yet to be achieved," he said.
"It remains an unfinished revolution, we still have unfinished business."
The crowd was told that the party's membership had increased greatly since it was formed last September and that it was strategizing its plan for the future and its aim of an Irish socialist republic.
