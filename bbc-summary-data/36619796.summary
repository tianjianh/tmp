The 45-year-old, previously of Ospreys, was with Bristol for three seasons.
"Sean departs having fulfilled his remit of helping Bristol return to the top flight," director of rugby Andy Robinson told the club website.
"Sean was ready for a fresh challenge and we felt now was the right time to restructure our coaching department."
Holley, who had signed a new contract in March, added: "I'm delighted and proud to have played my part in helping Bristol reach their goal of getting back to the Premiership after a seven-year absence.
"However, it's been a tough three years with some highs and lows and professional rugby takes its toll, especially on the family who have remained living in Wales.
"I'd like to thank everyone involved with Bristol for some great memories and wish them all the best for the future but I now look forward to pursuing some new and exciting challenges."
