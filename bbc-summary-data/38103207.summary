Hawick Volunteer Park sports facility funding reassurance given

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Scottish Borders Council has said funding for facilities in a Hawick park is safe despite a local sports initiative being wound up.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The local authority previously gave Â£40,000 to the Hawick Sports Initiative (HSI) to maintain a sports pitch at the town's Volunteer Park.
HSI is now being wound up as it has decided it no longer needs to exist.
Agreement has been reached to give the funding to charitable trust Live Borders to improve park facilities.
Ewan Jackson, chief executive of Live Borders, said: "One of our priorities at Live Borders is to ensure that sports facilities in the region are of a high standard and widely available to all.
"We are delighted to be involved with the Volunteer Park project, it is a great example of how working together with local clubs and organisations can benefit the community as a whole."
David Davidson, who chairs HSI, added: "I am delighted that Hawick Sports Initiative has been able to deliver sports facilities at the Volunteer Park and through this agreement has ensured that any unused capital can be passed on for the next phase of maintaining the 2G pitch and to upgrade the changing facilities at our new 3G pitch. "
He said all of HSI's funding would stay in the town to support future development.
