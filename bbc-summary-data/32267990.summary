Gordon Jack was taken to hospital at about 16:40 on Friday, but died on Saturday afternoon.
The former Daily Record photographer collapsed and fell to the ground as pictures of Murray were taken as he walked outside the cathedral.
He was described as an "outstanding photographer".
First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has sent her condolences to Mr Jack's family.
She tweeted: "Totally devastated to hear about the death of Gordon Jack. A lovely man and a great photographer. My thoughts with his family & colleagues."
Daily Record picture editor Alasdair Baird said: "Gordon was an outstanding photographer and journalist who was loved and respected in equal measure by his colleagues.
"He was equally comfortable covering a warzone or a fashion shoot.
"His passing is a great loss to our industry and he will be sorely missed by all that knew him."
The National Union of Journalists (NUJ) Scotland tweeted: "Our condolences to the wife and children of Gordon Jack who has died after a fall at Dunblane Cathedral covering Andy Murray's wedding."
Mr Jack, who ran a picture agency in West Lothian, was taken to Forth Valley Royal Hospital in Larbert.
He is thought to have died from complications following a heart attack.
He leaves a wife and three children.
