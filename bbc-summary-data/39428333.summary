Irvine has been a key figure in BBC golf presentation for 25 years and the lead anchor of the sport since 2009.
She will continue to present snooker and major events for BBC Sport and will be back on screens fronting the World Snooker Championship in April.
Eilidh Barbour will take over as the BBC's golf TV presenter, starting with the BMW PGA Championship in May.
On her decision to leave BBC's golf coverage Hazel said: "I was pleased to be offered another long-term contract with BBC Sport to continue presenting snooker, golf and major events.
"However, after much thought, I have decided that in what is my 30th year in broadcast sport, I want to realign my on-air commitments around the changing needs of my family.
"I have loved working with my brilliant friends and colleagues on the BBC golf team and look forward to being in Augusta to see Danny Willett defend his title and to savouring the unique atmosphere of the Masters one more time.
"I am delighted that a fellow Scot, Eilidh Barbour, will be given this chance. I'm sure that she will enjoy it as much as I have."
Barbara Slater, director of BBC Sport said: "It is with a heavy heart that we say goodbye to Hazel having been the familiar face of the sport for 25 years.
"However, we respect her decision and look forward to her continuing to front our snooker and major events coverage for many more years to come."
