A terminally ill man whose wish is to marry "the woman of his dreams" says he has been "overwhelmed" by the public's help in raising funds for his wedding.

Emma Haggan, 30, and Jamie Tanner, 36, were planning their dream wedding in Italy when Jamie was diagnosed with terminal cancer.
Prolonged medical treatment meant that the Bournemouth couple have had to put tying the knot on hold.
A campaign, run by the Wedding Wishing Well Foundation, has raised Â£7,500.
Mr Tanner was diagnosed with small-cell carcinoma - also known as small-cell lung cancer - in August 2015.
He is currently being treated by specialists at The Royal Marsden Hospital in London.
"At first we were told it could be lymphoma and that Jamie had a good chance of survival. This then became testicular cancer and again his chances seemed good but unfortunately he was finally diagnosed with small-cell carcinoma which is extremely aggressive and at this time considered incurable", said Ms Haggan.
Despite being in pain, the family said Mr Tanner remains "determined" and "strong".
Ms Haggan said: "Jamie has been my superman, accepting every challenge and treatment and fighting every step of the way.
"The cancer is now in his lungs and the treatment makes him very ill, yet I seldom hear him complain."
The couple met eight years ago after moving next door to one another.
Ms Haggan said: "Our relationship was romantic from the very beginning. He had grown incredibly close to my daughter, Amara [who was born with hip dysplasia] and never missed a hospital appointment or operation.
"Eventually though, Jamie and I decided to start trying for our own baby and were blessed with a daughter in July 2010."
Though the couple are no longer able to travel to Italy for their wedding, they hope to marry in May while Mr Tanner's condition is still stable.
