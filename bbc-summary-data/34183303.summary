[SN]TITLE[SN]
Van driver who ran over and killed student 'passed out'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A van driver who ran over and killed a student passed out after allegedly drinking coffee at the wheel, a court in Caernarfon has heard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Kevin Rose hit a Vauxhall Corsa before mounting a pavement in Bodelwyddan, Denbighshire, in November 2013.
He struck pedestrian Lucy Brown, 18, of Prestatyn, killing her instantly.
Mr Rose, 57, of Guildford, in Surrey, denies causing death by dangerous driving, and an alternative charge of causing death by careless driving.
The prosecution told Caernarfon Crown Court on Monday that Mr Rose maintained he had taken a swig of coffee from a flask while stationary, then as he drove along the road he started to cough.
He was said to have stated: "It's almost like something got stuck in my throat. That's the last I can remember."
But the prosecution claimed Mr Rose took a mouthful of coffee while he was driving, saying liquid was found in the driver's footwell and was splashed between the steering wheel and dashboard.
He lost consciousness after coughing caused him to faint, brought about by him drinking coffee while driving, the prosecution added.
Forensic accident investigator Brian Grocott told the court evidence showed Mr Rose had not braked as he hit Miss Brown.
Forensic scientist Andrew Davidson, who also gave evidence, said coffee stains discovered after the crash revealed the cup was most likely being held by the driver around the steering wheel-area rather than the central console.
He also ruled out the possibility it could have spilt from a cup holder in the centre of the dashboard.
The trial, which has been adjourned until Wednesday, continues.
