The Hearts board will meet in the next 24 hours to assess progress on the club's search for a new head coach.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Owner Ann Budge has been leading a four-strong team who have been interviewing candidates over the past two weeks.
It is highly likely that Jon Daly will remain in charge for Saturday's Premiership visit to Motherwell.
Dougie Freedman, who was interviewed, has taken up the position of sporting director at Crystal Palace, where he previously played and managed.
Former England boss Steve McClaren was on a shortlist of targets but has since gone to Maccabi Tel Aviv as a coaching consultant.
Interim head coach Daly has been interviewed, along with former Tynecastle players Steven Pressley and Paul Hartley, while contact has been made with Billy Davies.
BBC Scotland understands the board will have three options at their disposal.
BBC Scotland has also learned that Scot Gardiner will be leaving at the end of the month. Gardiner joined the club as part of the business management team back in July 2014 just a few weeks after Budge assumed control.
