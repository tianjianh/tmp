Anglesey cat Oreo caught in illegal trap has paw amputated

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A cat has had to have his paw amputated after it was caught in an illegal trap, the RSPCA has said.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The pet, named Oreo, was found in Rhostrehwfa, near Llangefni on Anglesey after he managed to drag himself to a local house.
The metal spring-operated device is used to catch animals, but while it is legal to own, it is illegal to set.
A neighbour freed Oreo using bolt cutters and he was taken to a vet but his paw could not be saved.
The RSPCA has appealed for information about the trap being set.
Inspector Mark Roberts said: "We're sure somebody in the local area will know something about this sorry incident."
