[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
People in Aberdeenshire are being sold sick and unhealthy puppies, the Scottish SPCA has warned.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The animal welfare charity said it was investigating several cases of puppy sales in the area, and has warned the public to be cautious.
The Scottish SPCA said it was particularly concerned that unscrupulous breeders would target buyers in the lead up to Christmas.
An undercover officer warned: "Many pups are carrying diseases."
The officer explained: "Those involved in the illegal trade of dogs have no concern for the welfare of the animals and are only interested in making a profit.
"Many puppies will start to show signs of being ill soon after being bought and in the worst case scenarios will sadly die, which results in a great deal of heartbreak for the new owners, as well as potentially large vet bills.
"Our advice to anyone considering buying a puppy is to always go to the breeder or seller's home or kennels and insist on seeing the dog's mother.
"People should never buy any animal in a public place no matter what excuse the breeder provides or allow the dog to be delivered to their home.
"No-one should ever feel pressured into buying a pup and if someone is offered a dog at a discounted price which sounds too good to be true, it is generally that price for a reason."
