Schwazer, 31, helped Italy win the world 50km walk team title in May after a 45-month ban for a positive test for erythropoietin before London 2012.
A retest of a sample given in January showed traces of steroids.
The Court of Arbitration for Sport rejected his appeal.
"All competitive results obtained by Alex Schwazer from and including 1 January 2016 are disqualified with all resulting consequences, including forfeiture of medals, points and prizes," CAS said in a statement.
Schwazer had previously admitted to using the blood booster erythropoietin (EPO) in 2012.
