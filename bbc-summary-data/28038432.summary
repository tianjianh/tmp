[SN]TITLE[SN]
Newport shooting: Caroline Parry 'controlled' by husband

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man who shot his wife dead in a Newport street was "controlling" and would not let her out of the house at night, a court has heard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Caroline Parry was shot in the back at close range near her home last August.
Her new partner Gary Bidmead told Newport Crown Court Ms Parry was underweight and very unhappy in her marriage.
Christopher Parry, 49, from Cwmbran, denies murder but has admitted manslaughter.
On Thursday, Mr Bidmead told the jury he met Ms Parry in November 2012 while she was walking her dog.
He said she was crying at the time and he asked her if she was ok.
Their relationship developed gradually from then, the court heard, but did not become sexual for a long time.
They moved in together in April 2013 and Mr Bidmead described their relationship as "brilliant".
"She was very unhappy in the marriage," Mr Bidmead said.
"He was very controlling and wouldn't let her go out. She wasn't even allowed to go on holiday with her mother."
He went on: "She would have to be in the house by 7pm and wouldn't be allowed out after then.  She was way underweight when I met her, she wasn't eating.
"She was allowed to stay with her mother overnight maybe once a month."
But Roger Thomas QC, defending, said Ms Parry would go clubbing and would send romantic texts to Mr Bidmead during her marriage, which would suggest she was not a controlled woman.
Mr Bidmead told the court that after Ms Parry left her husband he would send her texts asking her back and would phone her and become aggressive when she refused.
He said Mr Parry, a driver for the Celtic Manor Resort, would swear, call Ms Parry names and she worried he would harm himself or her.
Earlier, neighbour Jade Mineur said she heard two loud bangs "like fireworks" on the day of the shooting.
She said she heard the shots and looked out of her window just as Mr Parry turned the gun on himself.
Ms Mineur dialled 999 and went outside to help.
She told the court via video link: "I went to the woman and checked her pulse and then I checked the man's pulse and he was alive, I saw his chest move slightly," she said.
Roger Thomas QC, defending, read a section of Ms Mineur's police statement to the court.
She had told police: "The look on his face was as if he was in disbelief himself it had actually happened.
"It wasn't like it was shock like 'I've done it', it was as if he could not believe it had happened."
The trial continues.
