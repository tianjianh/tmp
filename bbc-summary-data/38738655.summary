A teenager has been jailed for five years for the "soul destroying" rape of a 14-year-old girl.

Kyle Parish, 19, of Clifton in Nottinghamshire, pleaded guilty to rape at an earlier hearing at Nottingham Crown Court.
The victim's mother said the attack "totally destroyed" her daughter's childhood.
She said: "It totally devastated her. She has real low days and panic attacks."
She added: "She is not the confident child she was before this attack happened.
"She attempted to cut both wrists a few weeks after he was put on bail.
"It has totally destroyed our family life ... the littlest thing will take you back to that day.
"It is just soul destroying thinking how is she going to cope with this. That her first encounter was a violent rape."
The court was told the girl was with a group of friends who were camping out in a field.
When the pair were alone, Parrish, of Horwood Drive, grabbed her against her will, threw her to the ground and raped her.
Judge Stuart Rafferty said: "The devastation is not just for five minutes, five hours or five days - this will last a lifetime.
"He has taken away from her the one thing that matters to us all - that is the right to say 'yes' or 'no'."
Her mother said her daughter has had counselling but the past 18 months have been "a living hell".
