Mary-Jean O'Doherty, 33, sang Face The Shadow in Vienna on Saturday as part of the group Genealogy.
Speaking to BBC Wales ahead of the contest, she praised the Welsh support which helped the group through the semi-final on Tuesday.
The group finished in 16th place with 34 points.
Speaking about her semi-final experience before Saturday's final, she said: "It's just one of those surreal moments where you just think 'wow'.
"There was a lot of Armenian flags and Welsh flags as well which was great. There was so much positive energy."
O'Doherty, born in the United States to an Australian father and a Greek-Armenian mother, has settled in Cardiff with her Welsh husband.
She was selected for this year's contest by broadcaster Public Television of Armenia.
"I have never been to Armenia and I have always wanted to know about my heritage, about my genealogy," she added.
"I couldn't think of a more interesting or outstanding way to do both."
The UK was represented at Saturday's show by duo Electro Velvet, who finished in 24th place with five points.
