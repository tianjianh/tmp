The woman was named by colleagues in a community group as Anne Clayton, from Poynton, Greater Manchester.
According to French media reports she hit a tree on Monday morning while skiing in the resort of La Plagne.
A Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) spokeswoman said it was helping her family and liaising with French officials.
Ms Clayton was reportedly on a blue run, an area of piste usually graded as suitable for novices, when she lost control.
She was treated by a mountain rescue team but died of her injuries at the scene.
The FCO spokeswoman said: "We are supporting the family of a British national who has sadly died in Macot le Plagne, France, and remain in contact with the French authorities over the incident."
Tributes have been paid by her fellow volunteers at Manchester Street Angels.
The group posted a tribute on its Facebook page: "We share this news with a very heavy heart.
"Our very dear friend & amazing angel has sadly passed away. God needed a true Angel to join him.
"Sending all our love to her family, friends & fellow Angels. Rest in peace, gone but never forgotten."
