Cranfield University fined after worker injured in bomb explosion

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A university has been fined after a worker suffered serious injuries when a cluster bomblet he was trying to deactivate exploded.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Swindon Crown Court heard no risk assessment for the activity had been carried out at Cranfield University.
The institution pleaded guilty and was fined £80,000 with £75,000 costs.
The employee suffered severe chest and abdominal injuries and had surgery to remove metal from his colon after the explosion on 4 February 2011.
He also suffered cuts on his face and shoulder, and nerve damage to his right hand.

Cranfield University said the worker returned to work three months later.
The Health and Safety Executive said three employees at the Defence Academy on the Shrivenham Campus were deactivating military cluster bomblets.
An investigation found "no suitable risk assessment had been carried out for this type of activity and therefore the system of working was unsafe".
Evan Bale of the HSE said: "The worker's injuries were life threatening and could have been avoided had a thorough assessment of the risks been carried out.
"As the university admitted, the task should not have been carried out in this manner.
"Cranfield University is properly recognised internationally for its explosives research and teaching, but in this particular case the standards for managing safety fell far short of what should have been in place."
Cranfield University said: "We deeply regret this incident and have co-operated fully with the health and safety investigation, as was accepted by the court.
"This was an isolated incident."
