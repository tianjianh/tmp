He tweeted a photograph of himself lying on a stretcher following the crash on Monday, praising rescuers.
South Wales Police said two motorists were taken to hospital as a precautionary measure following a collision on Tondu Road at 19:00 BST.
"Thank you to everyone," said Mr Byrne.
The former Newport Gwent Dragons captain retired from the sport last year after an injury.
