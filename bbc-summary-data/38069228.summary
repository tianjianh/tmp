Calais child migrants leave Devon 'respite centre'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
All the children brought to a facility in Devon from the so-called Jungle migrant camp in Calais have now left.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Thirty-one of the youngsters, said to be under the age of 18, were reunited with family members in Britain.
Six, who are eligible for asylum, are being helped into more permanent living arrangements.
The Home Office says no more young people are expected to be transferred to the centre near Great Torrington where they arrived on 24 October.

Some local community groups welcomed the child migrants, but there were also protests.
The Home Office, which ran the operation to resettle the children, maintained the hostel was a temporary respite measure.
It was designed to provide a safe and welcoming base before the children were moved to other areas of Britain.
The Jungle camp has since been bulldozed by the French authorities.
