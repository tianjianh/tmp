Car crash spurred on young Selkirk artist Alex Hain

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A young Scottish artist who was involved in a serious car crash five years ago is about to stage his first professional exhibition.

Alex Hain, from Selkirk, was driving a route he had taken many times near St Boswells when he was involved in a major accident.
The back end of his car slipped and spun out of control before hitting a tree.
It left him with a punctured lung and his car was a write-off.
The scrapmen who came to collect his vehicle thought whoever had been inside it must have died, given the extent of the damage.
That lucky escape inspired the 25-year-old to turn to art.
Largely self-taught - his mother, father and sister are professional artists - it was only after his accident that he began to paint full-time.
He described his work as being "self-medicating" as he recovered physically and emotionally.
He said: "I didn't even like art at school, it was too academic, all about 'who could draw that teacup the best' rather than originality and creativity.
"I'm also dyslexic so struggled with words so I couldn't have coped with the essays if I went to university.
"I was bedbound after my accident and started drawing portraits - I just felt an impulsive need to draw."
He said the crash played a key part in pushing him to produce more art.
"It was a catalyst and it was a necessity to paint more than anything else," he told the BBC Scotland news website.
"I found it such an immediate way to communicate feelings with other people, with no boundaries in the way.
"Unlike the English language which often stops me from saying what I really want to say."
It brought Alex to the attention of the Castlegate House Gallery in Cockermouth where his work is going on show alongside Somerset artist Jess Pigott.
"To be discovered by Castlegate House Gallery is such a relief, that's scary and exciting at the same time, like a fire in my belly, and I can't wait to see where this will go," said Alex.
Gallery owner Steve Swallow added: "Alex says he is driven to paint - it's what he gets up for every morning.
"Everything he does is deliberate, his use of colour is so sophisticated and the results are very powerful.
"Discovering someone like Alex is why we travel many miles every month in search of new artists."
The exhibition runs from 28 March to 18 April.
