Ben, from Sheffield, was 21 months old when he disappeared on the Greek island of Kos.
An "item" believed to have been in Ben's possession at the time was found during fresh searches.
South Yorkshire Police said the current line of inquiry, that Ben was killed accidentally, was the most probable cause for the boy's disappearance.
