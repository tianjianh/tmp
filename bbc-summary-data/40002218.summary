The fire service said that a "significant quantity" of material is on fire at the Castlebawn site on Portaferry Road.
The advice has been issued to those in the Court Street and Castlebawn areas.
The fire in the County Down town has been burning for four days, according to the Newtownards Chronicle.
In a statement, the fire service said that it had extinguished one area of the fire.
"We have been liaising with environmental health from Ards and North Down Borough Council and the site owners, and are awaiting a digger to arrive on site to separate the rubbish and rubble to enable us to continue with firefighting operations."
