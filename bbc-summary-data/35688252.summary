Estimates of the number of foreigners living in the country vary, but according to the last official census the number was just over two million.
For some, life in South Africa can be tough - xenophobic attacks and a weakening rand are just two of the problems they face.
The BBC's Outside Source spent the day with foreign shopkeepers in the township of Diepsloot, close to Johannesburg, to find out what life is like and what their hopes are for the future.

Outside Source is broadcasting its radio and TV programmes live from Wits University in the South African city of Johannesburg on Tuesday 1 March, discussing subjects from migration to student protests. Follow @BBCOS on Twitter to join the debate.
