The Bank of Japan's Tankan survey's headline index fell three points to plus 12, which was below expectations as business sentiment worsened for the first time in three quarters.
Investors are betting on more stimulus from the central bank on the back of this data, analysts said.
The Nikkei closed up 1.9% at 17,722.42.
The survey comes just a day after data showed that Japanese factory output shrank by 0.5% in August from July, and retail sales also fell short of expectations.
Chris Weston, market strategist at trading firm IG, said the weak outlook from Japanese firms will only "add fuel" to calls for more easing from the central bank.

Chinese markets are closed for public holidays until 7 October.

The benchmark S&P/ASX 200 index closed up 1.8% to 5,111.10 points.
Shares of copper miner Oz Minerals jumped over 20% after news that US equity firm KKR bought a 10% stake in the miner despite falling commodity prices.
South Korea's Kopsi index also finished up 0.8% to 1,979.32 after data showed that factory output in August was stronger than expected as consumption grew.
The industrial output index rose by a seasonally adjusted 0.4% in August from July, after a revised 0.3% fall in the previous month.
