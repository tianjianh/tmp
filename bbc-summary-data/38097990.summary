Carwyn Jones backs FAW over 'ludicrous' Fifa poppy row

The first minister has backed the Football Association of Wales (FAW) as it faces disciplinary proceedings from football's world governing body for incidents including "fans wearing poppies" at a recent match.

It relates to commemorations at Wales' 1-1 draw with Serbia on 12 November.
Carwyn Jones said Fifa had shown "an incredible lack of judgement".
"We fully support the FAW in strongly contesting these ludicrous charges," he said in a statement.
International Football Association Board rules ban "political, religious or personal messages" on kits, while Fifa ground safety regulations say "the promotion or announcement of political or religious messages" in stadiums is "strictly prohibited".
Teams breaching the rules can be fined or have points deducted.
The FAW said the incidents being investigated include "fans in the stands wearing the poppy" and the presence of "a member of the armed forces holding a bunch of poppies at the exit of the tunnel".
On Thursday, Mr Jones said: "We share the FAW's surprise and disappointment at this latest decision by Fifa following the game against Serbia earlier this month.
"To criticise supporters for showing their personal or collective respects for those who fought so bravely for our freedom and our futures is particularly galling and shows an incredible lack of judgement."
The Irish Football Association is also under investigation for events prior to Northern Ireland's 4-0 victory over Azerbaijan on 11 November.
