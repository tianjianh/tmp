Robert Evans, who is standing as the Labour candidate, was the first MEP for London North West, specialising during his time in the European Parliament on European crime prevention.
He is a former primary school teacher who now works as a freelance consultant and public-relations executive and is the chairman of Runnymede and Weybridge Labour Party.
Mr Evans is campaigning to resist funding cuts and "privatisation" plans and said he would "reverse" cuts in support for domestic abuse and freeze further police station closures, pledging there would be no "soft touch" policing on his watch.

Kevin Hurley, a former borough and public-order commander with the Met, is standing as a candidate for the "zero tolerance policing ex chief" party.
He comes from a family with strong police links - his parents served in the force as does his son - and has experience of dealing with police balance sheets as well as being a chief constable in Iraq.
The former detective chief superintendent describes his police methods as "no nonsense" and said he wanted police chiefs to be leaders, not bureaucratic managers, and he was a strong believer in zero-tolerance policing.

Julie Iles, was selected from an initial shortlist of six candidates by the Conservative Party in Surrey.
She has been a magistrate for 10 years and chairman of the South East Surrey Youth Panel, serving on the youth justice advisory committee. She worked in information technology for 20 years, advising business executives.
Mrs Iles says she wants to correct the disparity between Surrey's low crime rate and poor detection rate, ensuring police are "visible" and available to the public, and to work with other agencies to target anti-social behaviour and alcohol-related crime.

Nick O'Shea is a businessman and former Mole Valley district councillor, with strong police connections, who has been chosen as the Liberal Democrat candidate.
His father and grandfather were both in the Surrey force and another family member is currently a serving officer.
Mr O'Shea is a director of a number of businesses and a chartered management accountant. He said he wanted to put the focus on victims and witnesses of crime - improving support to encourage more offences to be reported.

Former Surrey police officer Robert Shatwell is UKIP's candidate. He said he understood the workings of Surrey Police and the problems it faced because he was part of the force for 18 years.
Mr Shatwell wants to re-establish the beat officer system and continue UKIP's policy of "zero tolerance" on crime. He said prison sentences were far too lenient and there was no deterrent being used to reduce the number and severity of crimes.
UKIP leader and South East of England MEP Nigel Farage said he was delighted that the party had a candidate with such experience running for the position.

The current chairman of Surrey Police Authority, Peter Williams, has been an independent member of the organisation he hopes to replace for nine years.
He has worked in the criminal-justice system for more than 20 years and has been a magistrate for 17. He said that as a chief executive he has experience of handling large budgets.
Mr Williams wants to build on the county's recent reputation for high public satisfaction by continuing to consult residents on policing and said his priorities would include tackling anti-social behaviour, collaboration with neighbouring forces and holding the chief constable to account.
