Plans to ban dogs from Carmarthenshire playgrounds

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Plans that could see owners compelled to put their dogs on a lead and a ban on the animals in playgrounds will be discussed by Carmarthenshire council.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A consultation prompted 620 responses, with 98% saying owners should clean up after pets and 69% saying dogs should be excluded from play areas.
But 70% did not want to see dogs excluded from beaches.
The council's environmental and public protection scrutiny committee will consider proposals on Monday.
