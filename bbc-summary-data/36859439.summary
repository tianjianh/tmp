The 22-year-old is a product of the Sale academy and his form last season saw him play for England Saxons in South Africa this summer.
Since his debut against Saracens in 2013, Haley has established himself as Sale's first-choice full-back.
"Since I joined the club it has moved on in leaps and bounds," he told BBC Sport.
"If, when we were in contract talks, Sale were talking about being in mid-table then I wouldn't have been interested in staying - I'm here to win things."
Director of rugby Steve Diamond added: "Mike is one of the best full-backs in the game and for him to sign a three-year deal is great news.
"He can go all the way to the top and it's a statement to clubs out there that we intend to keep hold of our home-grown players."
