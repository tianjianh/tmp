David Ball missed from close range for the hosts, while a strike from team-mate Ashley Hunter forced a good save.
Hunter then set up Devante Cole who shot over, while Shaun Whalley wasted a one-on-one for the visitors.
Abu Ogogo missed the chance to win it late on for Shrewsbury as they remain a point above Fleetwood, who occupy the final relegation place in League One.
Shrewsbury earned their first clean sheet since October on manager Micky Mellon's return to the club with whom he won promotion to the Football League in 2012.
Shrewsbury manager Micky Mellon told BBC Radio Shropshire:
"We should have won it, probably comfortably, because of the amount of clear cut goal scoring opportunities we created.
"There were just so many one against ones and there were others that went across the face of the goal like Shaun Whalley's.
"But we've also seen that we are capable of defending. They now know the standard they have to achieve in order to keep clean sheets at this level."
