The festival is held near Beauly in the Highlands and runs until Saturday evening.
Organisers said the event, known as Bella, was expected to attract about 18,000 music fans.
Acts at this year's Bella include Madness, Two Door Cinema Club and The Darkness.
Other bands playing the festival are Super Furry Animals, Alabama 3 and Public Service Broadcasting.
Arrested Development were due to play but had to pull out as lead singer Speech is too ill to travel.
Measures are to be taken this year to reduce traffic congestion that occurred when the show and festival took place at the same time in 2015.
These include opening the campsite at Belladrum earlier than previously.
Police Scotland said it had been working with the event organisers and other partners to ensure a "safe and enjoyable event".
There is live and exclusive coverage of the festival on BBC ALBA from 21:30 on Thursday 4 August, and 21:00 on Friday and Saturday.
