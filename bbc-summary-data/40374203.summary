Barry McNamee's left-foot shot took a slight deflection over Mark McNulty's head for the opener after 17 minutes.
Sean Maguire provided the pass for Karl Sheppard to finish with aplomb into the left-hand corner on the half hour.
Gearoid Morrissey fired home a 35-yard right-foot piledriver on 36 but Jimmy Keoghan was sent-off after the break.
Midfielder Keoghan received two yellow cards in the space of a couple of minutes midway through the second half.
Derry started the game brightly and almost took the lead through Ronan Curtis's low drive but McNulty saved with his fingertips, after which the ball hit the post and rolled across the line, before being cleared.
McNamee broke the deadlock with his seventh goal of the season, but Sheppard equalised and Morrissey struck home the spectacular winner.
In the second half, Ger Doherty saved from Stephen Dooley, while Aaron McEneff and Conor McDermott were off-target with efforts.
The Candystripes put the pressure on late on as they went in search of an equaliser but substitute Mark Timlin side-footed the ball straight at McNulty, who also denied Rory Patterson.
Derry remain fifth in the table despite a second successive defeat, with Cork runaway leaders at the top, 18 points ahead of Dundalk.
