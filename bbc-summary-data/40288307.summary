[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Officers said a 43-year-old had been picked up in a car and driven to Century Mill in Farnworth, Bolton at about 12:00 BST on Friday.
He was attacked by a group of men, police said, before being returned to Masefield Drive with serious injuries. He died four days later in hospital.
A 28-year-old man remains in custody for questioning.
Det Insp Cheryl Hughes, from Greater Manchester Police, appealed for information, adding: "We are determined to bring these violent criminals to justice.
"This incident happened in broad daylight - the offenders picked the victim up and then returned him with serious injuries to a residential area - so someone must have seen something."
