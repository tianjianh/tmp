Dr Hugh Blaise O'Neill, 61, from Tasburgh, Norfolk, has been charged with two counts of rape and four of gross indecency.
The offences date between the early 1990s and early 2000s and do not relate to his professional role, police said.
Dr O'Neill is due to appear at Ipswich Magistrates' Court on Thursday.
An NHS England spokesperson said: "We are aware that Dr Hugh Blaise O'Neill, who was a GP in Horsford, has been charged with a number of sexual offences against girls.
"As this matter is the subject of an ongoing legal process, it would not be appropriate to comment further at this stage."
