[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Erectile dysfunction drugs worth £500,000 were found in a garden shed after a raid at Atilla Fodor's property in Datchet, Slough.
Fodor, 38, was charged with importation and possession of unlicensed medicines with intent to supply and the supply of unlicensed medicines.
He was sentenced to 10 months in prison at Reading Crown Court.
An investigation carried out last year found Fodor had netted more than £27,000 from the illegally imported drugs.
They are only allowed to be sold on prescription in the UK.
Alastair Jeffrey, head of enforcement at Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), said: "Selling unlicensed medicines is illegal and can pose a serious risk to health.
"Criminals involved in the illegal supply of medical products aren't interested in your health - they are only interested in your money.
"MHRA will continue to track down and prosecute those who put the public's health at risk."
