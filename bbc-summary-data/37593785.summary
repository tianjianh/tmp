[SN]TITLE[SN]
Wigan Athletic 0-0 Burton Albion

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Dan Burn twice cleared off the line as Wigan shared the spoils in a goalless draw against Burton at the DW Stadium.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Burn blocked an early Lucas Akins shot and then intervened to deny Chris O'Grady's audacious effort from 40 yards, lifting the ball over stranded Latics goalkeeper Adam Bogdan.
Wigan's Adam le Fondre threatened twice before the break, testing keeper Jon McLaughlin before chipping over.
Nick Powell and Michael Jacobs also went close after the interval.
Wigan's second goalless draw in as many games extended their unbeaten run to three matches, but left them 21st in the table after 11 games.
Burton, who are still searching for their first Championship win on the road, are six places higher than Latics, who are yet to beat them in a competitive match.
Wigan manager Gary Caldwell:
"It wasn't the greatest of games. In the first half they had the better chances and better spells in the game, but I thought we controlled the second half.
"We created some great opportunities, but a draw was probably a fair result.
"I thought Burton were very good. They gave exactly what I thought they'd give.
"There were no surprises today for me. Our set-up defensively looks good, but attacking-wise the creativity, spark, energy and final pass wasn't there, which is the frustrating thing."
Burton boss Nigel Clough:
"We've got to do more to get a goal when we're in control like we were in the first half.
"We've got to try and improve on the number of situations in and around their penalty area that didn't result in a clear-cut chance or a finish. That's been our story on the road this season.
"It's still a good draw away from home for us because they're got as good a squad as anyone in this league.
"That's one goal conceded in the last three games, so when we get our defensive unit right out there we're tough to break down. Apart from a couple of skirmishes and chances we defended very well."
