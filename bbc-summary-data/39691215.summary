Whiteside, 31, secured a unanimous victory over Carly Skelly in the flyweight contest in Rotherham.
"Winning a seventh title is great but my main aim for next year is to represent England at the Commonwealth Games," said Whiteside.
"This win means I should be well in line for selection."
Light-welterweight Cherrelle Brown and middleweight Natasha Gale both won their third national titles while light-flyweight Demi-Jade Resztan took her second national championship.
In the men's competition, light-flyweight Kiaran MacDonald, light-welterweight, Luke McCormack, middleweight Ben Whittaker and heavyweight, Cheavon Clarke all won second elite national titles.
