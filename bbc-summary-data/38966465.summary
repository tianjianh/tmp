It's part of a celebration of the re-opening of the Settle to Carlisle line in Cumbria which had to be closed after landslides damaged the railway line.
Tornado, the steam train pictured above, will run two return journeys a day between parts of Cumbria and Yorkshire from the 14 to the 16 of February.
The company which owns the trains think they will be pretty popular!
