[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Anton Rodgers' free-kick was enough to give Swindon victory as they beat Bradford at the County Ground.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 23-year-old opened his goalscoring tally for the season to give the Robins their sixth League One win this campaign.
Bradford should have taken the lead after nine minutes when Marc McNulty found himself in on goal but he fired his attempt wide.
Swindon almost took the lead through Lloyd Jones' powerful header but Colin Doyle saved it on the line.
The home side were awarded a free-kick in the 19th minute which Rodgers curled into the top-left corner from 30 yards.
Striker James Hanson found himself with the chance to equalise six minutes before half-time but he rifled his shot from close range over the bar.
Nathan Delfouneso should have doubled Swindon's lead midway through the second half but his glancing header went just wide of the post.
Hanson had a chance in the 82nd minute to earn his side a point but he could only direct his header onto the woodwork.
