Thames Valley trains disrupted by hot weather

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Hot weather is set to disrupt trains in the Thames Valley area with speeds being cut over fears of rails buckling.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
First Great Western has amended some services from midday to 20:00 BST because of the expected intense heat.
There will be no fast trains between London Paddington and Bourne End in Buckinghamshire or Henley-on-Thames in Oxfordshire.
Network Rail said if the track buckled the line must be closed for repairs "causing considerable disruption".
Trains from London Paddington will terminate at Twyford for a connection with a branch line service to Henley-on-Thames.
Passengers travelling to Bourne End will see their services from Paddington terminate at Maidenhead and will also have to complete their journey on a branch line train.
Temperatures are set to hit 30C (86F) in parts of the Thames Valley, the Met Office said.
