It began about 17:00 GMT on Saturday and was focused in Benbradagh Avenue. The PSNI said a "suspect package" has been declared a hoax.
Sinn FÃ©in councillor Brenda Chivers, who was at the scene, told the BBC some residents had been evacuated and some businesses had been closed.
She said it was an "unwelcome and unusual occurrence in Limavady".
