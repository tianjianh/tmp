West Bromwich Albion striker Brown Ideye's return to international football has been stalled by a 'minor injury' that has forced him out of the Nigeria squad for two friendly matches next week.

Ideye has not played for the Super Eagles since November 2013 and he also missed out on the 2014 World Cup in Brazil.
He was named in a 28-man squad for Nigeria's fixtures against Uganda and South Africa on 25 and 29 March respectively.
We wish him a speedy recovery and hope to see Ideye when the Nations Cup qualifiers start in June
But the 26-year-old did not play in his club's 3-0 loss at Manchester City on Saturday, with West Brom medical staff telling Ideye he would be out of action for a week.
As a result, he was forced to withdraw from the squad on Sunday, according to Super Eagles officials.
"A minor injury has forced Brown Ideye to pull out of the Super Eagles friendlies against Uganda and South Africa," national team spokesman Toyin Ibitoye told BBC Sport.
"It's only a minor setback for him. We all know it would have been a good return to the international fold after a long absence.
"But his health is more important. We wish him a speedy recovery and hope to see Ideye when the Nations Cup qualifiers start in June."
Ideye has scored five goals in 24 appearances for Nigeria.
In 2013, he helped his country clinch their third Africa Cup of Nations title, scoring in the 4-1 semi-final victory over Mali.
A member of their 2010 World Cup squad in South Africa, Ideye was omitted from the Nigeria squad that reached the second round at the 2014 World Cup in Brazil.
