Regan Charles-Cook scored his second goal in as many games with a peach from 25 yards in the 11th minute.
Moors doubled their lead midway through the half when Jack Byrne flicked on a corner at the near post for Simeon Maye to head home under pressure from goalkeeper Josh Barnes.
Barnes made a great block to deny Omari Sterling-James, who struck the crossbar at the start of the second half, and a few minutes later the forward went close with a 25-yard free-kick.
Ben Close had a rare opportunity for the visitors four minutes from time but his low shot from distance flashed wide of the left-hand post, before Solihull hit the crossbar again in stoppage-time following a thunderbolt from substitute Harry White.
