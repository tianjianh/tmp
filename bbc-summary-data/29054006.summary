On Tuesday evening a window was smashed when a piece of concrete was thrown at their house.
Police are treating the attack as a hate crime.
The family have been living in Moneymore for two years and say they have been the targets of 13 separate incidents of harassment.
The Polish couple, who do not speak much English, have five children aged from 12 years to five months.
Their 12-year-old daughter who has grown up in Northern Ireland spoke for the family.
"People have been damaging our car and last night someone damaged our window," she said.
"We want to be moved, we are very scared for the younger children.
"The police can't really do anything because they don't know who is doing it.
"We don't want to leave Northern Ireland though, we are happy here."
SDLP councillor Christine McFlynn said the attacks on the family had been happening since June.
"It is completely unacceptable that a family should be putting up with this.
"Last night a stone was thrown through the window of the house where there were two adults and two very small children.
"The family are very frightened. I totally condemn what has happened."
