Report into using silent fireworks in Edinburgh to go ahead

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Councillors in Edinburgh have agreed to commission a report into the impact of noise from firework displays and whether silent pyrotechnics could be used instead.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
It follows a call from councillor Joanna Mowat who said it was a constant complaint from residents who said the capital had become a "tourist city".
Edinburgh's Hogmanay said fireworks were a "signature element of an event".
The council said it would have the report completed by February or March.
Ms Mowat, a Conservative councillor whose ward covers Edinburgh city centre, told the BBC Scotland news website: "I am delighted that my motion calling for a report into the impact of fireworks on the residents, pets and buildings and the city has been accepted and a report will be brought forward early next year.
"This is an opportunity to look carefully at this issue and investigate whether new technology can reduce the noise but keep the spectacle which could make life a little quieter for residents of the city protecting the high level of amenity for residents of Edinburgh."
1) Recognises that the fireworks set off regularly in the city add excitement, colour and gaiety to celebrations in Edinburgh but that there is an impact from these regular fireworks on the residents living close to the launch sites and that there are concerns that the increasing scale of such may be having adverse impacts and
2) Calls for a report in two months to investigate:
a. What impact the noise of the bangs has on the health and wellbeing of people and animals;
b. What damage may be caused to property from the vibrations from the large pyrotechnic displays;
c. What other options are available for keeping the spectacle but reducing the impact such as silent fireworks.
Penny Dougherty, director of Unique Events which produces Edinburgh's Hogmanay on behalf of the City of Edinburgh Council, said: "The Edinburgh's Hogmanay fireworks are the signature element of an event that brings in 150,000 visitors from around the world and generates an economic impact of over Â£42m to the city of Edinburgh.
"Firework displays are a key part of every major New Year celebration around the world, and Edinburgh holds its own with cities such as London, Sydney, Dubai and Rio de Janiero at midnight on 31 December.
"We work closely with our pyrotechnic company, Titanium, one of the world's leading fireworks design companies, and all other agencies to deliver displays that are safe and enjoyable for those watching, not only in Edinburgh but for up to 30 miles around the city.
"We announce all our firework displays well in advance, through our marketing and social media campaigns and advise pet owners in the city and within earshot of the castle, to keep their animals indoors at these times."
