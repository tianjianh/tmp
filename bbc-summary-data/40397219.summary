[SN]TITLE[SN]
Youth hostels chief to step down

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The chief executive of SYHA Hostelling Scotland is to step down.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Keith Legge has been in charge of the not-for-profit self-funding charity for 13 years.
The organisation said this period has seen the most radical rationalisation and modernisation in its 86-year history.
SYHA has a turnover of Â£8m and employs 250 people. Over 400,000 people stay in its 34 youth hostels and 28 affiliate hostels in Scotland each year.
Speaking on his retirement, Mr Legge said: "SYHA is now a professionally-minded, modern not-for-profit organisation, true to its founding ethos with clear objectives that are understood and embraced by all, giving more people authentic and affordable access to all areas of Scotland from cities to more remote rural locations.
"It has a positive culture that understands the importance of customer service and is clearly focused on delivering the core ethos. It is also aware of the ever-changing needs of our guests and the marketplace in which we operate, and is able to embrace and adapt to change."
