Rebecca Evans, 27, from Bridgend, was eight months pregnant when she died in the three-car crash near Port Talbot.
Their son Cian, two, was airlifted to hospital suffering two broken legs and a fractured skull and husband Alex Evans was also in the car.
"I don't have a lot of words to sum up the past week," Mr Evans said. "My life will never be the same again."
He thanked the Wales Air Ambulance as Mr Evans insisted "Cian wouldn't be here today" without them.
The funeral of Mrs Evans, who was expecting daughter Cari "in a couple of weeks", will be held on Tuesday in the Carmarthenshire village of Penygroes.
"Becca was the most special person I've ever met." Mr Evans said in a tribute on Facebook.
"She was the most amazing mother to Cian - so loving and thoughtful.
"A truly beautiful person, inside and out. I have so many happy memories and I will never forget her."
The couple were on their way to work at homeless charity Shelter Cymru when the crash happened.
South Wales Police arrested a 50-year-old man from Cardiff on suspicion of causing death by dangerous driving before releasing him on bail.
