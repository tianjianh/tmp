The incident happened on Saturday morning in the Templehall area of Kirkcaldy.
A man followed the woman into her house in Harris Drive as she entered about 10:00.
She was then assaulted and threatened. The suspect left the property after about four hours, police said.
Det Insp John Anderson said: "This was a terrifying ordeal for the victim that took place in her own home and we are eager to trace this man as soon as possible.
"Anyone who recognises his description or saw anyone acting suspiciously in the Harris Drive area yesterday morning or afternoon is urged to come forward. People may also have seen him before or after the incident elsewhere in the Templehall area."
The suspect was described as about 30 to 40 years old, 5ft 4ins tall, with a medium to stocky build. He had a shaved head with a scratch to his face and head.
He also had an earring and was wearing a black zipped jacket with a brand logo on one of the shoulders.
The man was also wearing very distinctive 'Police' brand blue denim cargo jeans, which had long straps to the front.
Police later said that witnesses had come forward who described a man matching the suspect's description leaving from the rear of a block of flats which leads to a communal area dividing Davar Drive and Harris Drive.
They said the suspect may have visible injuries to his face caused during a struggle with the victim.
Det Insp Anderson said a highly visible police presence would be patrolling in the area to reassure the community.
Police are reviewing CCTV footage.
