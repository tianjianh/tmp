Eurovision 2016: Reporter's diary

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
It's time to dust off your sequins and fly your flag of choice for this year's Eurovision Song Contest.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The BBC's Helen Bushby is in the Swedish capital Stockholm, to bring you the latest from behind the scenes and give you a taste of the Eurovision experience.
And don't forget to check out the BBC Entertainment News team's Twitter feed and on Instagram. For videos of all the entrants, visit the Eurovision website and you can see all the BBC goings-on here.
Well I'm here now at the Ericsson Globe in Stockholm - a kind of giant golf ball which just happens to be the world's largest spherical building. It's truly impressive and makes for a very curvaceous skyline, which seems somehow appropriate for Eurovision.
The press room is also cavernous, located next door to the Globe in another arena-like building called the Hovet. It is full of desks and huge screens so we can watch the show, and we've seen and heard the rehearsal for tonight's semi-final. My lips are sealed.
The Swedish think of everything, so our welcome pack includes a water bottle, rain poncho, pen and some hairspray. I can stay hydrated, dry and coiffured - what more could a girl want?
Everyone working here has been incredibly efficient and helpful, and they even have life-affirming messages posted around the press centre, such as this one:
So far this is a very welcoming, friendly event, resulting in a happy band of hacks swapping tips and business cards.
Leslie Skipper, a journalist working with the Maltese entrant, Ira Losco, has offered a nugget of happy news about her. She's expecting a baby, which has meant that her dress had to be "let out a bit".
He says: "Since her song is Walk On Water it's not hard to guess the jokes the commentators will make about breaking waters.
"There are only six people maximum allowed on stage (she has a dancer and backing singers) so we will bill her bump as her Seventh Wonder. That's the song she was runner-up with in Eurovision 2002."
I've been speaking to John Kennedy O'Connor, broadcaster and author of The Eurovision Song Contest: The Official Celebration, who begs to differ with Simon about the frontrunner.
"For months now, everyone seems to be thinking that all Russia has to do is show up and the victory is theirs.
"Yet now rehearsals have begun, the extremely elaborate staging for You Are The Only One and the weak singing voice of Sergey Lazarev has put the assumed victory in doubt.
"The fans following the rehearsals seem to be moving towards France for the win now with J'ai Cherche from Amir.
"Personally, the French song sounds far, far too similar to Sweden's 2013 entry that crashed and burned.
"My own instinct all along has been that Italy has the song most likely to challenge the Russians this year and I'd love to see Francesa Michielin triumph with No Degree Of Separation."
He adds that the "Marmite entry" this year is San Marino's I Didn't Know by Turkish superstar Serhat.
"Although nobody expects him to win, he has won over the fans who were dismissing his chances of even qualifying for months," he adds.
"With Turkey remaining absent from the contest, it's very likely the Turkish diaspora will support tiny San Marino's entry."
And what about the UK?
"The UK has been well thought of and the likable Joe and Jake are clearly engaging with the fans and the audience," he says.
"But You're Not Alone is certainly not strong enough to win and unfortunately, Denmark has submitted an almost identical track, Soldiers Of Love.
"Both nations are going to have to work very hard to differentiate themselves should Denmark reach the final. Ireland's song is pretty similar too.
"I'm not sure how far Westlife's enormous popularity spread beyond Ireland and the UK, but I am sure Nicky Byrne has many fans outside the British Isles. However, that's rarely enough on its own to claim a victory.
"I'm sure Nicky will be happy enough just to reach the final and get off the bottom rung, something Ireland has not achieved since 2012."
Kennedy O'Connor adds that other countries creating a buzz in rehearsals are Ukraine, Serbia, Norway and not forgetting Sweden.
With the big night just three days away, speculation is hotting up as to who will win.
So what do some of the Eurovision experts think?
Simon Bennett is secretary of the OGAE UK, part of a network of 42 Eurovision Song Contest fan clubs across Europe and beyond. He is optimistic about the Joe and Jake's chances, saying: "The UK has its best chance of a good finish in years. We have a catchy song performed by two enthusiastic and instantly likeable guys.
"However, the competition is really tough this year with several very strong songs.
"Russia are the front runners with an upbeat song performed with great style.  It's very "Eurovision" but could play well with TV voters.
"After years in the doldrums France has a very strong entry, sung partly in English, much to the chagrin of the French government minister responsible for defending the Gallic tongue from Anglo-Saxon encroachments.  France hasn't won for 40 years so they are due a good finish."
He describes Australia as "serious contenders with a classy power ballad" and says Cyprus, the Netherlands, Austria and Poland are also worth watching.
"Ireland is looking to Westlife veteran Nicky Byrne but the song may struggle to make its mark in its semi-final, and a famous name may not be enough to carry it through. I think it's unlikely to be at the top of the scoreboard cone Saturday," he adds.
Hello from sunny Stockholm - I've just landed on a plane from London bursting with Eurovision fans.
One of my fellow passengers, Owen Brigstock-Barron, is meeting five friends in the Swedish capital.
"We've hired an Air B&B with a Swedish cat," he tells me, adding they're all going to tonight's semi-final (except the cat, which has better things to do, obviously).
"On Saturday night, we're having a house party to watch the final," he says, although he's sad at the prospect of missing out on Graham Norton's distinctive BBC commentary.
Owen's got all his Eurovision paraphernalia packed in his suitcase - inflatable union flag lips, an inflatable electric guitar and of course, a giant British flag to wave. But he did whip out a cheeky pair of sunglasses from his hand luggage to get him in the mood.
He's not keen on the hot favourite Russia, Sergey Lazarev's special-effects laden You Are the Only One.  Owen's money is on the Netherlands winning, with Douwe Bob singing the tuneful, folk-tinged Slow Down.
And he's also placed a bet on the UK's Joe and Jake, with their upbeat pop song You're Not Alone. Their odds shortened recently from 50/1 to 25/1.
Time is ticking and I need to check into my accommodation and get my Eurovision accreditation organised.
