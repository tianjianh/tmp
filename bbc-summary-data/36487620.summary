[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A ferry that grounded while travelling between Guernsey and Herm will be out of service until July, Guernsey's harbour master has said.

Captain Chad Murray said there was "contact damage" to Travel Trident V and the port side propeller and shaft.
He said while the hull had not been breached the spring tides meant the boat could not be returned to the water until next month.
The ferry firm said the loss would not impact on its schedule.
The harbour master is responsible for investigating the incident.
He said: "The hull wasn't breached so there was no risk of water ingress or pollution.
"Obviously we know it was very foggy, it was near low water and the vessel obviously made contact with the seabed so it is pointing to some sort of navigation error.
"But whether that's human factors or defects or vessel procedures then we're not at that stage yet."
Mr Murray paid tribute to the action of the captain who along with the crew took "all the right steps" including getting the passengers in lifejackets, checking for water ingress and quickly alerting the coastguard.
It follows an incident in April, which is still being investigated, involving the same ferry and an underwater object.
Mr Murray said the master on that day had his licence revoked for six months and would need to reapply if they wanted to operate in local waters again.
He said the reports into both incidents are due to be made public.
