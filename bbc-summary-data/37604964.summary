James Attfield, 33, was knifed to death by the then 15-year-old James Fairweather in Colchester in 2014.
Fairweather, who went on to murder 31-year-old Saudi Arabian student Nahid Almanea three months later, is now serving a double life prison sentence.
Julie Finch, 53, told the BBC how, after the trauma of her son's death, she had also lost her job and home.

"Since it happened, our lives have just spiralled and gone the way they have," said Ms Finch, six months after her son's killer was imprisoned. "We just get up and do what we have to do but it is never going to be the same."
She told how she sat through Fairweather's two-week trial in Guildford, describing the experience as "very painful".
"During the trial I actually lost my job - it was on the day of the guilty verdict. The care home I worked at (she was a carer) announced it was closing, so I would be out of work.
"We also had to sell our house because we had got behind on our debts.
"I was signed off work and moved into rented accommodation."
Her daughter Joanne Robinson, 32, had been living with her but has been living in a homeless shelter in Clacton since the family home was sold.
Ms Finch, of Coggeshall, said she now faced eviction because of rent arrears.
"When something like this happens, it is not just the loss of your loved one but the loss of everything you've known."
