[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Joseph Sheridan, 13, died of multiple injuries after the crash on the Southend-bound carriageway of the A127 near Basildon in February.
An inquest into his death earlier heard there were no issues found with the BMW involved.
A verdict of accidental death was recorded by Greater Essex Coroner Caroline Beasley-Murray.
Joseph was hit by a car near the junction with Oak Lane, a private road which leads to the former Dale Farm travellers' site.
The following night about 30 people blocked the road in protest by parking cars across the lanes. The road was shut for about five hours.
Signs on the A127, which has a 70mph (112kmh) speed limit along the stretch involved in the crash, warn: "Do not cross. Fatal accident site."
The 31-year-old BMW driver was initially arrested on suspicion of causing death by dangerous driving but was released without charge.
