[SN]TITLE[SN]
Birmingham heart surgeon Ian Wilson's patients' inquest begins

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An inquest has begun into the deaths of three patients treated by the same surgeon at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Alan Tringham, 78, Peter Brookes, 72 and Alan Lucas, 77, all died after being operated on by Ian Wilson.
Mr Wilson was sacked amid claims he inaccurately reported medical data. Concerns arose after an audit found 15 of his patients died in a year.
The inquest at Birmingham Coroner's Court is expected to last four days.
