Mr Wilks' grandmother, Susan Coley, said she was the "last person to see him alive".
"He said 'I'll be back soon' nana, I said 'don't get into any trouble', and he said 'I won't'.
"Somebody phoned us and said 'your grandson is in the infirmary'. We went down there and sat there until he died."
She described her grandson as "jolly" and "just full of life".
"He'd do anything for you," she said.
Mr Wilks' grandfather John Coley added: "He was a very nice lad. Everybody loves him."
Garry Monk, Leeds United's manager, said he had spoken to Mallik Wilks and the club would "support him in the right way".
He could be part of the squad for the FA Cup match away at non-league Sutton United on Sunday.
Det Ch Insp Stuart Spencer said a murder inquiry had been launched and detectives were trying to "establish the full circumstances surrounding the incident".ã€€
"Although our inquiries are still at a relatively early stage, we believe this has been a targeted attack on the victim," he said.
"We would like to hear from anyone who was in the area yesterday and witnessed the incident or who has any information that could assist the investigation."
Floral tributes have been left at the scene. One message reads: "Daddy you were sadly taken".
A post mortem examination is due to take place later.
