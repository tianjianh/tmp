Aberdeen have confirmed Ash Taylor and Lawrence Shankland will follow Ryan Jack, Niall McGinn and Peter Pawlett in leaving the club this summer.

Goalkeepers Neil Alexander and Aaron Lennox are also moving on.
Pawlett had already signed a pre-contract with MK Dons while Pittodrie boss Derek McInnes indicated in recent months Jack and McGinn would leave.
And Cammy Smith, 21, agreed a two-year deal with St Mirren, where he had been on loan from Aberdeen.
Youth players Robbie Mutch, Jamie Henry, Dylan Thomas, Aaron Norris and Joe Nuttall are also leaving Pittodrie.
Defender Taylor, 26, midfielder Jack, 25, and winger McGinn, 29, all started Aberdeen's 2-1 Scottish Cup final defeat by Celtic and midfielder Pawlett, 26, was an unused substitute.
Jack, who has been linked with Rangers, had been Aberdeen captain but Graeme Shinnie was skipper for Saturday's game at Hampden and McInnes confirmed before the final Shinnie would have the armband next season.
Northern Ireland international McGinn has spent five years with Aberdeen, two more than Wales Under-21 cap Taylor. McInnes said in March McGinn's agent "indicated that there may be (English) Championship interest" in the player who has scored 93 club goals.
Former Rangers and Hearts keeper Alexander, 39, joined the Dons on a one-year deal last summer. He has also played in England and was capped three times by Scotland.
Australian Lennox, 24, was loaned to Raith Rovers in season 2016-17 and has been capped up to under-23 level for his country.
Shankland was loaned to Greenock Morton earlier this year after two loan spells at St Mirren while fellow striker Smith initially joined the Buddies after a spell on loan at Dundee United. Both Shankland and Smith have played for Scotland Under-21s.
"Everyone at Aberdeen FC would like to thank all the players who are leaving for their tremendous commitment to the club, in some cases over many years, and wish them all the very best for the future," Aberdeen said in their statement on Wednesday.
