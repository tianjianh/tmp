[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The body of 60-year-old Elizabeth Mackay, or Muir, was discovered at a house in Inverness on Thursday.
It is the same terraced bungalow where the body of hairdresser Ilene O'Connor, 39, was found in 2006.
Brian Grant, 50, was jailed in 2007 for beating Ms O'Connor to death and burying her body in the garden.
Ms Mackay's body was found at about 16:45 on Thursday at the home in Kintail Court.
Police said a "major investigation" was under way into her death.
Door-to-door inquiries are being carried out along with a review of CCTV footage.
Det Con Insp Keith Hardie said: "'We are at the very early stages of the investigation and I am appealing to anyone who may have seen Elizabeth in the days leading up to Thursday.
"This lady has lost her life and we need to piece together the circumstances. I would encourage anyone who may have seen or heard anything suspicious to contact police."
It is understood the dead woman, described as a "quiet and private woman", was found with some injuries and that there was blood on the floor.
She is thought to have lived alone in the terraced bungalow in the Hilton housing estate of Inverness.
