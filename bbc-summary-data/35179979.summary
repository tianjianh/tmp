Scottish Premiership: Dundee 2-1 Dundee United

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Dundee came from behind to win the second city derby of the season as Dundee United failed to improve their position at the foot of the table.

James McPake was carried off following a challenge on John Rankin and Blair Spittal scored after a free-kick was awarded against the Dundee captain.
But Eiji Kawashima's mistake let Kane Hemmings score and Nick Ross' deflected shot also beat the debutant goalkeeper.
United's miserable day got worse when midfielder Guy Demel was sent off.
It was only Dundee's second win in this fixture in a decade and, significantly, moves them 16 points clear of their city rivals in the Scottish Premiership table.
Paul Hartley's side had to fight back from the loss of McPake to a suspected dislocated knee early on after he fouled Rankin.
The captain was booked by referee Kevin Clancy before being taken to hospital for treatment.
To make matters worse for the hosts, Spittal scored from the resulting free kick, the midfielder curling a swerving 25-yard effort past a helpless Scott Bain.
However, the Dundee goalkeeper did make a couple of crucial saves after that.
First, he pushed away an acute angled drive from Billy Mckay, set up by another fine bit of play by Spittal with a defence-splitting pass.
Then it was Rankin's turn to be denied by Bain as United played the more incisive football for long spells in the early stages.
It was typical blood and thunder derby fare at a packed Dens Park, the first 45 minutes being particularly eventful, with Kawashima heavily involved.
The Japanese international was cleared to make his debut and, for long spells of the first half, you could see why manager Mixu Paatelainen worked so hard to get him.
He made a couple of decent saves during an opening period dominated by his new team, but four minutes from half time he showed an alarming vulnerability.
The Tannadice team have struggled all season to cope with high balls played into their penalty box and so it proved again.
Nicky Low played a free-kick from deep on top of Kawashima, who made a hash of his punch and Hemmings hooked the loose ball home for his sixth goal in the last three matches.
The goalkeeper claimed in vain for a foul and it was a painful lesson that he cannot expect the sort of protection in Scotland that he has been used to back home or during his spell in Belgium.
Not that his afternoon got any better as Dundee hit the front in 62 minutes with the aid of a deflection as a Ross shot spun off Sean Dillon.
That was enough to wrong foot the unfortunate goalkeeper and his new team start the New Year rooted to the foot of the table and needing a miracle to stay up.
