In an open game boasting 38 shots, Reading keeper Ali Al-Habsi smartly saved Tjaronn Chery's free-kick.
He was beaten by Hall's header but Rakels smashed in Yann Kermogant's pass and then fired over before half-time.
Matt Ingram - making his home debut - saved an Oliver Norwood free-kick and Jake Cooper header after the break.
Al-Habsi was kept busy in the opening stages of the second half too, making saves from a Sebastian Polter shot and header.
Teenage left-back Cole Kpekawa, making his full league debut for Rangers, headed over and Chery had the chance to win it late on but could only miscue a shot from six yards.
Both sides had little to play for, with QPR ending the day 13th and Reading 15th.
But it is the Royals who may be most pleased with a point having has lost 12 of their last 15 away games before travelling to Loftus Road.
Brian McDermott's side still only have two wins in 12 outings, while QPR boss Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink may also be concerned - his side have one win in seven.
QPR manager Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink:
"I think we did enough in the first half to come in ahead and it was frustrating that they scored so soon after we scored.
"It had the feeling of an end-of-season game and it was a little bit up and down. We couldn't get a foothold for a long spell - they had it and then we had it.
"But in the end, I still feel we had enough chances to have made it 2-1."
"With two more games this season, if you're not already starting to plan for next year then you will have a big problem. You need to plan in advance.
"It is clear the direction we need. We have to have younger players - more assets in the club.
"We have to look at more players who are 23, 24 or 25. I'm not saying we shouldn't sign a 30-year-old, but in the past few years too many players have come here to retire."
Reading manager Brian McDermott:
"I thought we were going to win it. Their keeper made a very good save from a free-kick.
"The last four games have been difficult to take because we played well and got nothing. But no-one wants to hear that, so it was important we got something from this game.
"When you lose four games in-a-row it isn't pleasant. Losing to Middlesbrough late on was tough, then going to Leeds and playing well and getting nothing, and then getting nothing against Hull.
"We needed to get at least a point. All in all, we'll take that point and now get on with our lives."
