Ed Winter, a spokesman for the county Medical Examiner's Office, confirmed the death was ruled a suicide.
The keyboard player also had heart disease and depression brought about by alcohol, the coroner's report said.
Emerson, the co-founder and keyboardist of progressive rock band Emerson, Lake and Palmer, was 71 years old.
Speaking to the Mail On Sunday, his long-term partner Mari Kawaguchi said the musician had been "tormented with worry" about an upcoming tour.
She explained he had suffered nerve damage to his right hand which affected his playing.
"He had an operation a few years ago to take out a bad muscle but the pain and nerve issues in his right hand were getting worse," she said.,
"He didn't want to let down his fans. He was a perfectionist and the thought he wouldn't play perfectly made him depressed, nervous and anxious."
Kawaguchi discovered Emerson's body last Friday morning when she returned to the apartment the couple shared in Santa Monica, Los Angeles.
His death was announced by band-mate Carl Palmer, who called him "a gentle soul whose love for music and passion for his performance as a keyboard player will remain unmatched for many years to come."
Palmer has since stated he is organising a tribute concert for Emerson later this year.
"This I feel, is the very least I can do to honour Keith's talent and musicianship in the best way I know."
Emerson was known as one of the most technically-accomplished and flamboyant keyboard players of his generation.
Born in Yorkshire, he began playing the Hammond organ and Moog synthesizer in his teenage years and formed The Nice with singer PP Arnold in 1967.
He founded the prog rock supergroup Emerson, Lake and Palmer in 1970. The band went on to sell millions of albums, including Brain Salad Surgery and Tarkus - whose title track acted as a showcase for Emerson's prowess.
In addition to his time with ELP, the musician released both solo albums and film scores, including Dario Argento's 1980 horror film Inferno and the 1981 Sylvester Stallone thriller Nighthawks.
