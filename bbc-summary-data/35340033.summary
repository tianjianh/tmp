His highest-charting US album previously had been The Next Day, which peaked at number two in 2013.
Nineteen of his albums entered the UK album charts last week, after fans sought out his classic hits.

His life in pictures
His first hit on the US singles chart was in 1972 with Changes. The record did not initially find major success, only reaching number 66 that year.
However the song returned to the chart in 1974, following Bowie's subsequent breakthrough on the American music scene with Space Oddity - his first top 40 hit which peaked at number 15.
His biggest selling single in the US was Let's Dance, which reached the top of chart in 1983. He also achieved seven top 10 albums.
The iconic singer died earlier this month following an 18-month battle with cancer.
Fans around the world have been paying homage to the 69-year-old at tribute concerts and memorial sites linked to musician.
Hundreds of fans in London packed out Islington's Grade I-listed Union Chapel on Sunday, while fellow music icon Bruce Springsteen covered Bowie's hit Rebel Rebel during the opening night of his new US tour.
In Belgium, astronomers have paid tribute to Bowie by dedicating a constellation to the self-proclaimed Starman. The constellation is made up of seven stars that, when connected, form the iconic lightning bolt seen on the cover of Bowie's Aladdin Sane album.
