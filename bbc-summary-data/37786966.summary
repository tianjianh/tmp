A landslide on a major highway in Colombia has killed at least six people, officials said.

On Wednesday, tonnes of earth engulfed the main highway leading north from Colombia's second-largest city, Medellin.
The mud from the mountainside covered an area the size of two football fields and buried two cars, a lorry and two motorbikes, rescue workers said.
Emergency workers are searching the mud for any more victims.
The landslide came down about 12km (7 miles) north of Medellin in the Copacabana area.
Landslides are common in this mountainous region of Colombia, especially following heavy rains.
Six years ago, 85 people died just a few kilometres south of Copacabana, when a landslide buried dozens of homes in the town of Bello.
