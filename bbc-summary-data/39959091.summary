[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Anomali specialises in threat intelligence and analysis, working with organisations which include the Bank of England.
The company was founded in 2013 and its investors include GV, formerly known as Google Ventures.
The jobs are expected to be in place by the end of 2019.
They are being supported with a Â£780,000 grant from Invest NI.
Invest NI is also making a Â£5.5m grant to the Centre for Secure Information Technologies (CSIT) at Queen's University, Belfast.
It forms part of a Â£38.5m research programme at CSIT.
Invest NI chief executive Alastair Hamilton said CSIT is undertaking "a very complex technology project which will be undertaken by a team of experts over a five year period".
Belfast has developed a significant cyber-security cluster with investments by firms like WhiteHat Security, Proofpoint and Black Duck Software.
Consultancy firms like Deloitte also have a cyber-security function in the city.
CSIT plays a key role in the cluster providing a stream of post-graduate qualified workers, running a business incubator and developing new security tools.
Its director, Dr Godfrey Gaston, said the money from Invest NI had helped attract further investment from funding bodies like InnovateUK and businesses such as Allstate and Equiniti.
