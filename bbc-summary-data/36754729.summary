Dan Halksworth shrugged off the disappointment of missing out on a Commonwealth Games qualifying time to retain the Jersey Triathlon title just hours later.

He had raced in a cycling time trial event at 07:30 BST but was ready at the triathlon start line for 11:00 BST.
Halksworth's time of one hour, 58 minutes and 34 seconds was easily enough to win it.
"It was pretty painful," he told BBC Radio Jersey.
"I'm not exactly in the best triathlon shape I've ever been in, but I had a good swim, the bike was strong and I kind of held on in the run.
"I managed to swallow a bit of seaweed, which was a bit weird and pretty disgusting."
Halksworth was convinced by organisers to defend his title despite officially retiring from triathlons last year to focus on cycling and making the Commonwealth Games.
Fellow Jersey-man Tom Perchard was second, while Jo Gorrod retained the women's title as the race reached its climax in heavy rain.
"It keeps conditions cool but you have to be a bit careful on the bike," said Gorrod.
"It's a great atmosphere down here, lots of people have come out to watch despite the poor conditions. It wasn't much fun on the bike and it was getting quite cold."
More than two hundred competitors took on the Olympic-distance course, which began with the 1,500m swim in front of Elizabeth Castle, before a 40km cycle from St Helier to the west of the island and back, and then the 10km run around the island's Waterfront area.
