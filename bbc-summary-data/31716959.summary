[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
More than half of food outlets in Wales achieved the highest hygiene ratings, a year after a law making them display the scores came into force.

The Food Standards Agency (FSA) said 56% of firms gained a 5 (very good) rating, up from 45% the year before.
The FSA said the law, the first in the UK, had been a "motivating factor" in raising standards for customers.
Welsh ministers said local councils were "tackling" firms with low ratings who were not displaying their ratings.
Deputy Health Minister Vaughan Gething said the scheme was "a really good example of regulators working together with food businesses in support of a common agenda".
