A man who was critically injured in a weekend assault in south Belfast has left hospital after his condition improved on Sunday evening.

He was attacked alongside his brother in the Donegall Road area at about 21:30 BST Saturday night.
A band parade was taking place in the area at the time, but police are not treating the attack as sectarian.
The badly hurt man, who is in his 20s, sustained a serious head injury and was treated in the Royal Victoria Hospital.
The second man suffered injuries to his face that were not believed to be life-threatening.
A spokesman for the Belfast Health Trust said the critically injured victim's condition stabilised on Sunday evening before he left hospital.
UKIP councillor Bob Stoker told BBC Radio Ulster it was his understanding that the assault was in no way connected to the band parade.
"It seems that this young fellow was standing actually watching the band parade with his girlfriend and an altercation, with people going down the Donegal Road, took place.
"His brother went to intervene and he was also assaulted," Mr Stoker said.
"It's not sectarian, it's not racist, it's one of these incidents that just happened and it happened as there was a band passing at the location where it actually took place.
"But the attack and assault has absolutely nothing to do with the band or the band parade, I think we need to make that very clear," he added.
The councillor said a vehicle was being forensically examined as part of the investigation and he appealed to anyone with information to contact police.
