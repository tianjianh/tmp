[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Cambridge's winless start to the League Two season continued as they were heavily beaten by Luton.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A frenetic first half ended goalless but the visitors then struck twice in as many minutes to win the game, with the opener coming after 62 minutes when defender Josh Coulson turned the ball into his own net after Glen Rea headed down Jordan Cook's free-kick.
Moments later the Hatters doubled their lead when Jack Marriott ran inside from the right and unleashed a superb effort beyond Will Norris and into the top corner from outside the box.
Deep into injury time Luke Berry lost possession to Jonathan Smith, who ran forward and gifted the ball to team-mate Danny Hylton, who powered home.
Both sides had missed chances in an exciting first period. Cook rattled the post inside four minutes, while - at the other end - Christian Walton was twice called upon to turn away Berry efforts before the game was 10 minutes old.
Pelly Ruddock also fired wide for the visitors when played through on goal by Hylton.
