[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Derby County midfielder George Thorne is expected to be out until mid-November, BBC Radio Derby reports.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 23-year-old suffered a double leg break against Ipswich Town in May last season and has had complications in his recovery, including an infection.
Boss Nigel Pearson has said he will not take any risks with Thorne, who has been plagued by injury while at Derby.
Thorne played 36 games for Derby in 2015-16, having missed most of the previous campaign with a knee injury.
