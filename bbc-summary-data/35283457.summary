The 21-year-old recently returned to United after making 29 appearances on loan at League One club Barnsley.
Pearson also featured in 22 games in a loan spell with the Tykes last season.
"We see him as energetic, box-to-box, likes a tackle and coming from Manchester United he is decent on the ball," manager Simon Grayson said.
"He's at the right age, wants to go and make a good career in the game and we are delighted that we have been backed by the owner to spend the money to bring Ben here."
Pearson could make his debut for Preston when they travel to Bristol City on Tuesday.
