Wigan Athletic 0-1 Huddersfield Town

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Nahki Wells scored a late winner as Huddersfield Town beat Championship strugglers Wigan Athletic.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Wigan, looking for a first win in seven games, tried to take the game to their high-flying opponents early on.
Both teams struggled to produce anything of quality in a game that looked destined to end goalless.
But when Elias Kachunga struck from distance, goalkeeper Jussi Jaaskelainen could only parry the ball and Wells reacted first to net from six yards.
The high-flying Terriers went into the game looking to avenge Wigan's 2-1 triumph at the John Smith's Stadium back in November, while the home side were in search of vital points in their fight against the drop.
Following a first-half with few chances, there was a flashpoint at the start of the second when Wigan's Yanic Wildschut raced clear and appeared to be hauled down by last man Tareiq Holmes-Dennis, but he was only shown a yellow card.
Wigan threw on Ryan Colclough, recalled from a loan spell at MK Dons, as they pushed for victory, but ended up with nothing when Jaaskelainen was unable to hold on to Kachunga's speculative strike.
Wells followed in to convert the winner 10 minutes from time, having also rescued his side three days earlier when he netted an injury-time equaliser against Blackburn.
Huddersfield remain fourth in the table, while Wigan are six points from safety in 23rd place.
Wigan boss Warren Joyce:
"It's certainly not a happy new year, no. It's a sickener, it's floored the lads - it's floored myself really.
"But things happen in life like that, and you've got to get on with it.
"It would be more disheartening if there weren't any performances going on. I think that's the positive we have to take from this.
"If we are going to get out of the situation we're in, we've got to be able to play well."
Huddersfield Town boss David Wagner:
"We had a fighting attitude and we were also patient, which is very important against a team like Wigan who have a threat on the counter.
"We had the right balance behind the ball, to avoid the counters, but technically we weren't quite there.
"In the second half, when we had a little bit more space, we created some moments and Nakhi put one of them into the net. This is why we deserved the result at the end."
