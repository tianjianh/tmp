English National Opera chorus pay dispute resolved

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The English National Opera (ENO) has resolved its dispute with its chorus, performers' union Equity has said.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The chorus had voted in favour of industrial action and planned to refuse to sing during the first act of a performance of Akhnaten on Friday in the row over pay and jobs.
Equity said "the chorus have had no choice but to agree to reductions in their guaranteed pay".
The ENO said it was "delighted" to reach a deal with the chorus.
Equity said as part of the deal, ENO management would be working with Equity and the chorus "to maximise opportunities for additional work during the summer when no opera is being produced at the Coliseum".
It added this would provide additional pay for members of the chorus and allow them to carry out outreach work outside of London.
Forty-two members of the 44-strong chorus backed industrial action in a ballot in February - two were absent due to maternity and sick leave.
The choir was protesting against plans to cut pay by 25% and axe four jobs.
By refusing to sing during the first act of Philip Glass's Akhnaten at London's Coliseum, the chorus would have been absent for around a quarter of the full duration of the performance - a reference to the proposed 25% cut.
Industrial action was suspended earlier this week pending further negotiations. Equity had said on Wednesday ENO management had agreed to talks with them aimed at resolving the dispute.
"I am relieved that this dispute has been settled without the chorus being forced into industrial action," Equity general secretary Christine Payne said.
"In the harsh financial realities ENO finds itself, as a result of cuts from Arts Council England, the chorus have had no choice but to agree to reductions in their guaranteed pay. We hope that this will mean that ENO management stabilises the company and returns it to all-year round opera production in the near future.
"I pay tribute to the dignity with which chorus members have conducted themselves through this very difficult time. They are an astonishing group of people. ENO remains a cornerstone of the UK's artistic life and the chorus is key to that."
The union said it had negotiated a pay package of £35,000 - with the initial proposal from ENO management being a reduction from £40,900 to £30,685. The new pay rates will take effect from August 2017.
ENO chief executive Cressida Pollock said: "We recognise the fundamental importance of the ENO Chorus in delivering world-class opera.
"We listened to the concerns of the chorus and have reached a fair compromise that preserves the permanent ensemble, focussing on our London Coliseum season, whilst ensuring that we have the building blocks in place to increase our outside work."
