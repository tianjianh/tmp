Lucas Piazon gave the visitors an early lead from close range and Orlando Sa doubled the lead soon after half-time.
But Fulham replied with three goals in six minutes as first Ross McCormack showed great skill to volley home.
Moussa Dembele levelled five minutes later, Alexander Kacaniklic completed the turnaround as he finished Dembele's pass before the Frenchman got the fourth midway through the second half.
The victory was Fulham's first win in five games as they moved into the top half of the Championship.

Reading dominated the first half and took an early lead when Piazon ended a fine move from the Royals. Sa found Matej Vydra, and the on-loan Watford striker threaded a perfect ball into the Brazilian, who finished from five yards for just his second goal in English football.
Nick Blackman, Piazon and Sa all had good chances as Fulham failed to have a shot on target in the first half.
But the game was set alight in seven second-half minutes, with Kit Symons' side turning their fortunes around to get their first home win in a month.
First Sa dispossessed Tom Cairney and brilliantly rolled the ball in off the far post from a tight angle on the right to double the Royals' lead and send them marching towards a fifth win in six league games.
But the home side were sparked into life by record signing McCormack, who flicked the ball up and volleyed past Ali Al-Habsi two minutes later.

Fulham had to wait five minutes for their equaliser, when Dembele finished from close range after Lasse Vigen Christensen's cross from six yards out, and the French forward helped make it 3-2 just 51 seconds later by providing a lovely through ball for Kacaniklic to slot home.
The victory was completed when Paul McShane's mistake was pounced on by McCormack and his back-heeled pass was tucked away by Dembele to end Reading's five-game unbeaten run in the Championship.
Fulham manager Kit Symons:
"We needed to get a win and we did. I'm a Championship manager and if you win you're all right and if you lose you get booed and your job is under threat. That's how the industry is. It's a really difficult job and that's the nature of it. I'm under no illusions.
"The club are in talks with [Moussa Dembele]. We'd like him to sign a new deal. The reality of it is he is at a football club where he will develop.
"He's far from the finished article - he needs to keep working hard and he knows that."
Reading manager Steve Clarke:
"I was disappointed with the way we conceded the first goal. When you go 2-0 in front you should go on to win the game. We conceded three goals in six minutes and the whole complexion of the game changed in those six minutes.
"I didn't say anything to the players because after a game like that sometimes it's better to say nothing and reflect calmly on the game when you have a better frame of mind.
"You hope it's a one-off. I'd like to think it is if you look at our defensive record. It was rock solid before this so hopefully this is an isolation and we come back into good habits."
