The 19-year-old will be going to his first Games, and is the third partner in as many Olympics for Daley, who won 10m individual bronze at London 2012.
"There's always going to be pressure on whoever Tom does synchro with," Goodfellow told BBC Sport.
"Instead of shying away from it you've got to accept it and you're going to have to deal with that."
Daley, 22, has risen to become an international sporting star since making his debut at the 2008 Games in Beijing aged 14, going on to have his own television programmes and books.

He and Goodfellow were brought together in 2015 and this year won silver at the European Championships, as well as the British title.
"We've been doing really well for the last 10 months that we've been doing it," said Goodfellow. "I used to go and watch Tom at competitions when I was younger and think 'one day I want to be as good as him' and now I'm competing with him.
"We've known each other for years now, since I was a junior on the circuit and he was probably still a junior at the time as well.
"We get on really well, we've not had to force anything in synchro pairing, everything's come quite naturally, so I'm looking forward to everything that comes in Rio."
And Goodfellow says his ambition is to reach the podium with Daley.
"A medal is definitely not out of the question," he said. "That's what me and Tom are going there expecting to get. We're hoping to get a medal and we'll give it our best."
