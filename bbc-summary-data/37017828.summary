Burton Albion earned their first-ever victory in the second tier, with club-record signing Jackson Irvine among the scorers against Sheffield Wednesday.

Kyle McFadzean met a deep free-kick to prod Albion ahead, only to then give away a penalty for a push, allowing Gary Hooper to level from the spot.
Irvine headed home from a John Mousinho cross to restore the Brewers' lead.
Burton's Tom Naylor and Wednesday's Barry Bannan were both denied by fine saves before Lloyd Dyer made it 3-1.
Burton, a side that were playing in English football's seventh tier when Sheffield Wednesday last featured in the Premier League 16 years ago, caused the Owls trouble throughout on their first trip to the Pirelli Stadium.
Before travelling to the Championship newcomers, Wednesday had kept clean sheets in their opening two games of the league season against Aston Villa and Norwich - both sides relegated from the Premier League.
During a bright start by the hosts, Stuart Beavon was foiled by Owls goalkeeper Keiren Westwood in a one-on-one inside three minutes, while Dyer, Jackson and Matty Palmer - whose free-kick created the opening goal - all looked particularly lively.
McFadzean, the club's record signing prior to Irvine's arrival in East Staffordshire, had a turbulent start to the match, volleying the Brewers ahead for his first goal for the Brewers before being punished by referee Neil Swarbrick, who controversially awarded a penalty as players jostled in the area awaiting a corner.
Irvine restored Burton's lead with a powerful header and the Brewers constantly threatened, with Naylor kept out by a fine Westwood save, while Lucas Akins had an effort ruled out for offside before Dyer ensured victory with a close-range finish.
Burton Albion boss Nigel Clough:
"It was thoroughly deserved. We deserved to win on Saturday and perhaps at Forest so it's been coming for the last 10 days. It's come against probably the best side we have played so far.
"From the first minute we set about the task in the right way, created chances all throughout the game and deserved the victory.
"We are not as good as players at other Championship teams, so we have to make up for it with honesty, endeavour, hard work and courage. When you have lost your first two games, to go out and play like that, with confidence, is a lovely thing.
"The third goal makes a difference. It makes the last few minutes a bit more comfortable but the penalty was the only thing that set us back. You see those in every single game. We have no problem with them being given as long as they give every one."
Sheffield Wednesday manager Carlos Carvalhal:
"Congratulations to Burton. They caused us a lot of problems but we didn't play with our full defensive line complete.
"We expected Tom Lees to recover but he felt pain and couldn't play. We had to readapt our defensive line when Jose Semedo came off and we didn't stay as strong as we do normally.
"We tried to play our usual game but we couldn't play as we can do. We expected to win three points and we didn't get what we wanted but the good thing is we have another game on Saturday when we will do our best to try and win."
