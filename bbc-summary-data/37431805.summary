County Championship: Derbyshire follow on at Worcester despite Hosein's hundred

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Young Derbyshire wicketkeeper Harvey Hosein's maiden County Championship hundred could not prevent Division Two's bottom side being asked to follow on against Worcestershire.

Resuming on 15-0, the visitors looked in danger of a three-day defeat when they slumped to 103-6 just after lunch.
But Hosein (108) shared a 96-run stand with debutant Greg Cork, son of former England Test all-rounder Dominic Cork.
After being bowled out for 248, Derbyshire then closed on 15-1.
Worcestershire vice-captain Leach, who took 5-60 in Derbyshire's first innings, struck an early blow in the second innings when he removed Ben Slater.
That took him past his previous best of 59 to 64 Championship wickets for the season, in addition to scoring more than 600 runs.
Hosein's fourth successive fifty-plus score was a great response by the 20-year-old to the arrival of Gary Wilson from Surrey on a three-year contract, which was announced earlier this week.
Assistant coach Matt Mason told BBC Herefordshire & Worcestershire:
"It was a flat, slow pitch but a fantastic day really. To take 11 wickets was a great effort from the boys. I'm really pleased for the bowling group as they've had it tough this year.
"It was one of the few occasions where the group of bowlers strung overs together from both ends and, even when they had that good partnership, they still hung in there and got their rewards.
"'Leachy' is on 64 with wickets now which is a fantastic effort. It's not a fluke or coincidence that he gets his rewards like that because he works so hard. He never stops trying.
"He puts the ball in the right areas, he bowls what I call a very brave length, a bit fuller than most bowlers do in this competition."
Derbyshire's Harvey Hosein told BBC Radio Derby:
"It was a really special feeling, getting my maiden first-class hundred. I've felt in good form in the last few games and long may it continue.
"I've worked very hard on my technique and temperament and things and luckily it is paying dividends. Hopefully I can keep improving and get even bigger scores. I just want to be a consistent performer.
"The wicket is still doing a bit off the seam but it seems to be a bit quicker now than earlier in the game so hopefully we can apply ourselves and get the runs we need."
