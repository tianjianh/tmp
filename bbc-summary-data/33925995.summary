Sand sculptors Remy and Paul Hoggard are using 80 tonnes of sand to create a scene of the barons and King John.
They will take two weeks to carve the sculpture in the grounds of the castle.
"It is going to be so highly detailed that people are not going to believe it's sand - they are going to be blown away," Mr Hoggard said.
One of the four surviving copies of the Magna Carta is displayed at Lincoln Castle.
Mr Hoggard said: "It's going to be fantastic. It is a little bit slow to watch but if you come every day you will see something new every day."
The couple recently completed a 300-tonne sand sculpture of elephants in a garden in Tehran, Iran.
The sculpture is being made as part of Festival800, which celebrates Magna Carta's 800th anniversary.
The Magna Carta sculpture will stand 4m (13ft) tall and 9m (30ft) wide.
Mr Hoggard said: "This is probably one of our most adventurous projects, in terms of size and scale."
The artist is originally from Beverley, East Yorkshire, but now lives on a farm in Bulgaria with his wife, who is Dutch.
Mrs Hoggard said: "It's a great honour to be invited to Lincoln in this special year, and with Paul almost a local lad, we will make something very special for Lincoln."
Mr Hoggard said: "This is probably one of our most adventurous project, in terms of size and scale. We're thrilled to be involved with Festival800."
Festival800 will also include music, comedy, poetry, street theatre, lectures and debate.
