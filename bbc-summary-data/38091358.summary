Outlander wins Book Week Scotland vote

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Readers have voted Outlander as the best book set in Scotland or by a Scottish author to be adapted for television or film.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Book Week Scotland poll saw 65% of almost 5,200 votes cast go to US author Diana Gabaldon's series of stories.
Outlander follows the story of Claire Randall, a World War Two nurse who is mysteriously swept back in time from the 1940s to 18th Century Scotland.
She is caught up in a Jacobite Rising and the Battle of Culloden.
Gabaldon has been influenced by her visits to the battlefield near Inverness in the writing of her Outlander books.
Among readers' reasons for choosing Outlander was its strong female lead and the use of Gaelic and the Scottish landscape.
In second place in the poll was Trainspotting, The Crow Road was third and The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie fourth. All are set in Scotland and written by Scots. Kick-Ass, a US-set graphic novel by Scots writer Mark Millar, was fifth.
Gabaldon said: "I'm deeply honoured at having Outlander even being included in such company.
"To have the books and show win such an award is fabulous, and a testament to the richness of Scotland and its people. Thank you so much."
The TV adaption of Outlander has been shown in the US by Starz and in the UK on Amazon Prime.
