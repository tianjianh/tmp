Thomas Mair watched the 41-second film of an American man shooting the .22 calibre gun on 7 June - nine days before Mrs Cox's murder, jurors heard.
The jury was also told that Nazi-related material was found when police raided Mr Mair's home.
The 53-year-old denies murdering Mrs Cox, 41, in Birstall, near Leeds.
Mr Mair, from Birstall, also denies grievous bodily harm with intent, possession of a firearm with intent to commit an indictable offence and possession of an offensive weapon - a dagger.
Earlier in the trial, the jury was shown an image of a sawn-off .22 Weihrauch bolt-action rifle, alleged to have been recovered when Mr Mair was arrested. They were told Mrs Cox's blood was on the barrel.
The court heard on Monday that when police raided the defendant's home after his arrest they found an SS officer's book on race theory and mate selection, along with other white supremacist texts.
Officers also found a book entitled March of the Titans: The Complete History of the White Race and a book on the "politics of the Holocaust", among other texts.
A press cutting in relation to Anders Brevik, who murdered 77 people in twin attacks in Norway in July 2011, was also found, the court heard.
The material featured in a series of photographs shown to jurors by prosecutor Richard Whittam.
Jurors were also shown images of head and hand injuries sustained by Mr Mair during his arrest.
Mr Mair had also allegedly collected a dossier on Mrs Cox in his home, including stories about her in newspapers.
And he had a printout of Mrs Cox, who was MP for Batley and Spen and a mother of two, from her website, jurors were told.
In the months before Mrs Cox's death, Mr Mair used computers at Birstall and Batley libraries to visit neo-Nazi websites such as the Daily Stormer, the court heard.
The jurors were told Mr Mair also searched for Dylann Roof, who is accused of killing nine black Americans in South Carolina in 2015, and accessed the Wikipedia pages for politicians William Hague and Jo Cox, as well as the Wikipedia page for Ian Gow - an MP who who died when the IRA detonated a bomb under his car.
Mr Mair's neighbour of 13 years, Katie Green, also gave evidence via video-link and said she saw the defendant on 16 June as she got off a bus in Birstall market place.
She told jurors Mr Mair was "very quiet, very shy but did not see any visitors", and he always kept his garden very tidy and spent a lot of time in it.
Mr Mair was "at the front of the queue looking like he was just waiting to get on to the bus", she said.
"He had a pair of dark trousers and a dark green khaki jacket and dark cream baseball cap.
"He always carried bags. He had three or four bags. I saw him walk off."
Ms Green said that she then heard about a gun incident minutes afterwards and decided to abandon her shopping trip.
The hearing was adjourned until Tuesday morning.
