She became the first British woman to win an individual European title since 1927 when she took 10m gold in 2014.
Barrow won Commonwealth silver in 2014 in the 10m synchro with Tonia Couch, but failed to make the 10m platform semi-finals at the Rio Olympics.
"Diving has had a huge impact on my life and I am so glad I have been able to finish how I wanted," she said.
Barrow's fourth-place finish in the 10m final at the World Championships in Barcelona in 2013 was the best performance by a British woman in the event's history.
"As for the future, I'm looking forward to finding something I'm just as passionate about," she added.
Barrow also won the European 10m synchro title with fellow Plymouth diver Couch in 2012.
