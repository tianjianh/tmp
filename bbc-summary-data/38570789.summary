[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man who hit his university lecturer wife in the head with a hammer as she slept has been detained indefinitely under the Mental Health Act.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Paul Bond, 62, attacked Dr Marian Bond at their home in Over, Cambridgeshire, on 11 July. Surgeons had to remove part of her skull to save her life.
Bond, who called 999 himself to say he had attacked his wife, was found guilty of attempted murder.
A judge at Cambridge Crown Court imposed a hospital order against Bond.
Cambridgeshire Police arrived at the couple's Willingham Road home to find Bond with his hands, cheek, chest and dressing gown covered in his wife's blood.

He had struck Dr Bond, a senior lecturer at Anglia Ruskin University, at least three times with a 2.5lb (1kg) lump hammer severely fracturing her skull and jaw, Cambridgeshire Police said.
Detectives described it as a "horrific assault which could easily have killed Dr Bond".
She was placed in an induced coma in hospital and part of her skull was removed. She has since made a partial recovery, police said.
In November, Bond admitted a charge of grievous bodily harm but denied attempting to murder his wife.
He was found guilty by a jury on Monday.
Imposing a hospital order on Bond without time limit, Judge Farrell QC said Bond had undoubtedly intended to kill his wife and had struck her with the hammer at least three times.
He was detained under Section 37 of the Mental Health Act 1983. A Section 41 restriction was also imposed meaning Bond will not be released until a mental health tribunal has decided it is safe to do so.
