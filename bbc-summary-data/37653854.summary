The Aspar Ducati rider from Toomebridge was taken away in a stretcher following the incident in Friday's session.
His Aspar team later tweeted that Laverty walked into the medical centre at the Motegi circuit and will have a routine check in hospital.
Laverty, who is 11th in the 2016 standings, is expected to recover in time for Sunday's race.
The 30-year-old secured a best finish of fourth this year and has 71 championship points with four rounds remaining.
Laverty will make a return to World Superbikes next season, competing on an Aprilia machine.
