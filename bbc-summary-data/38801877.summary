Lucie will be taking on singers and groups from all over Europe, after being chosen in a British public vote on Friday.
She told Newsround's Ricky she's hoping that her stripped-back ballad, Never Give Up On You, will help her to stand out from the rest.
The grand final takes place in Kiev in Ukraine in May - good luck, Lucie!
