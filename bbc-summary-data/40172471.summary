Thieves broke in to 95-year-old Percy Willmott's home in Cleethorpes while he was out shopping with his daughter on Friday.
His five medals, awarded for military service in North Africa and Italy, were taken from bedside drawer.
Mr Wilmott said he could not understand why he or his property had been targeted.

"The very fact that these young people can come round and know that there's an old soldier living in this house and there is his medals and 'I think I'll take them' doesn't bring sense to me," he said.
"That these people should do that to us old folk."
