Sarah Goldie, 18, was reported missing from her home in Renfrew on Friday. Her bag was later found in Glasgow, near to where a woman was seen in the water.
Ms Goldie's father, Gordon, appealed for help in tracing her movements.
He added: "Our lives have been torn apart by this in a way that you could never imagine."
Posting on social media, Mr Goldie said: "I'm Sarah's dad. Her mum, brothers and I would hope that everyone can share this as far and wide as possible to try and trace Sarah's movements on Friday please?
"If you think you may have any information, no matter how small or insignificant you think it may be, please contact Police Scotland by telephoning 101, or speaking to any police officer."
Mr Goldie later issued a statement through police urging people to help.
"Our whole family has been completely overwhelmed by the very kind words, calls and messages that we have received from both friends and strangers around the world.
"Yesterday's appeal on Facebook has had over 22,000 shares and has been very helpful to the police. If you have not shared this already, can you please do so as soon as possible?"
Mr Goldie asked anyone with "any information that they think may be slightly useful, or anyone who saw Sarah at any time on Friday in Renfrew or Glasgow" to contact police.
He added: "Complete strangers risked their own lives to try and save who I believe was Sarah on Friday night and we will never, ever be able to truly express our gratitude to them for their actions.
"If you heard or saw anything you think may be relevant - please call."
Police said that Ms Goldie left home at about 11:00 on Friday.
At about 18:00 she took a taxi from Glasgow to Renfrew, and was dropped off in Torridon Drive area.
About 19:40, police received a call about a young woman in the River Clyde near the Broomielaw and George V Bridge.
Emergency services including a helicopter began a search and two men entered the water, but the woman could not be found.
Ms Goldie's bag was recovered near the scene of the incident.
Ch Insp Mark Sutherland, of Police Scotland, said: "We have had a good response from the public about the young woman in the water. We are following a number of lines of inquiry with regard to identifying who she is."
He said the force's specialist marine policing unit and divisional officers were continuing to search the River Clyde on Tuesday.
"So far we have had no further reports of Sarah having been seen in Renfrew on Friday," he said.
"It is vital that we find out where she went after being dropped off by taxi in Torridon Drive, Dean Park, Renfrew.
"Officers have been checking CCTV, bus and taxi companies and with local business in the area to try and piece together her movements."
Ch Insp Sutherland appealed for anyone with information to contact police.
He added: "This is a horrendously distressing situation for Sarah's family and friends and officers are in close contact with the family to keep them informed."
Ms Goldie is described as white, 5ft 6in tall, of medium build, with brown eyes and sandy/strawberry blond straight hair.
She was last seen wearing a khaki green Parka-type jacket with a fur hood and was carrying a cherry-red handbag.
