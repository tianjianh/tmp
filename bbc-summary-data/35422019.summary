[SN]TITLE[SN]
Warwickshire 1980s child rapist jailed after appeal

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A 49-year-old man who raped a girl when he was 14 has been jailed after the Court of Appeal overturned his suspended sentence.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Jonathan Rouse was convicted of five historical sexual offences at Warwick Crown Court in November.
His original two-year prison sentence suspended for two years was "unduly lenient", said Solicitor General Robert Buckland QC MP.
Rouse, of Leamington Spa, was sentenced to three years' immediate custody.
He had been found guilty of raping a girl between October 1980 and January 1984.
Rouse, of Heathcote Road, Whitnash, was also convicted of four indecent assaults on another girl in 1980 and 1981.
