[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Jack Morrisson was reported missing on Friday, leading to searches of the water in Sutton at Hone, near Dartford. His body was found on Saturday.
His death is not being treated as suspicious, a Kent Police spokesman said.
His family said: "Jack, you were like a beautiful angel that we were sent. We have been so lucky to have you."
Jack played football for Volenti Football Academy, but his one true love was fishing, his family said.
In a statement, Jack's family said: "You were like our little golden boy, your life was so charmed and everything you wanted seemed to come to you.
"You have brought so much joy to us and we feel so blessed to have had you."
