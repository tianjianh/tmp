Bailey Gwynne review to probe agencies' work with killer

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A review into the circumstances surrounding the death of schoolboy Bailey Gwynne will investigate the authorities' involvement with his killer prior to the tragedy.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 16-year-old died after being stabbed with a knife at Cults Academy in Aberdeen in October last year.
His killer is serving nine years detention for culpable homicide.
The independent review, led by Andrew Lowe, is expected to be published in September.
As part of the investigation, a "detailed timeline" will be drawn up showing which agencies were involved with the killer, who cannot be identified for legal reasons. In the review he will be referred to as Child A.
It will also look at information sharing between agencies during his childhood.
In addition, the scope of the review will include:
The review was commissioned by Aberdeen City Council, NHS Grampian and Police Scotland in the wake of the trial of the schoolboy's killer at the High Court in Aberdeen.
The court heard that the schoolboy was fatally stabbed in the heart after a row over a biscuit.
Following the verdict, it also emerged that concerns were raised about the 16-year-old killer nine years ago, when he was in primary school.
During the review, its chairman, a former lawyer, will have access to all the necessary case files from the council, health board, the police and the Scottish Children's Reporter.
Andrew Lowe will also be able to draw on any additional independent professional expertise he requires to meet the terms of the review.
Mr Lowe is the independent chairman of child and adult protection for Renfrewshire and the chairman of the Glasgow Public Social Partnership for Learning Disability.
