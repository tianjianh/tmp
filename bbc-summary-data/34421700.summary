Lloyds Banking Group rose 2% and Barclays was up 0.6% after the banking regulator proposed a deadline for consumers to claim compensation for mis-sold payment protection insurance.
But credit checking firm Experian slumped 3.8% after a data theft.
Hackers stole data of more than 15 million customers.
The information was related to customers of mobile phone firm T-Mobile, which was held by Experian.
"Undoubtedly a breach of this magnitude is a major setback, especially to a company that takes data security very seriously ... Experian's business is that of handling data, which makes this incident particularly embarrassing," analysts at Barclays said in a note.
"T-Mobile is obviously reviewing its relationship with Experian. In itself the loss of one client is fairly immaterial but if it triggers other account reviews, it could become more significant."
FirstGroup fell 0.7% after it said trading for the first six months of the year had been in line with expectations.
On the currency markets, the pound was 0.6% higher against the dollar at $1.5224 but was 0.17% down against the euro at â‚¬1.3501.
