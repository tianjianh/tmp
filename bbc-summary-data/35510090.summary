Pools' Jake Gray grazed the crossbar within the first minute before Jakub Sokolik fouled Nathan Thomas to allow Billy Paynter to score from the spot.
Adam Jackson doubled the lead with a header from a corner and things got worse for the away side when Nathan Smith was sent off for shoving Paynter.
Francois Zoko headed in a late consolation from Simon Gillett's cross.
The win is Hartlepool's first in five League Two games and sees them leapfrog Yeovil and move into 21st place, four points from the relegation zone.
