The Stoke City keeper won 134 caps over 20 years and was part of the Republic's Euro 2016 squad.
Announcing his decision on social media on Thursday, the Donegal native wrote: "I was one of the lucky ones... but now it is time to hang up the gloves."
The former Newcastle, Celtic, Blackburn Rovers and Aston Villa keeper is set to continue his club career with Stoke.
Given was handed his international debut by Mick McCarthy in 1996 and was his country's first choice at both the 2002 World Cup and 2012 European Championships.
He previously retired from international duty after Euro 2012, but returned to help the Republic qualify for this summer's European Championship finals in France, where he was part of the squad but did not play.
Given tweeted his thanks to team-mates and fans for all their support.
"I'm one of the lucky ones who got to wear the jersey for his country and wore the badge with pride 134 times," he wrote.
"But now it's time to hang up the gloves and move from the onion bag to the terraces, where I'll be shouting the lads on as one of Ireland's biggest fans.
"So as I retire from Ireland to focus on my club career, I want to say a huge thanks to everyone who supported me all the way; my close family, friends and the amazing fans.
"I couldn't have done it without you."
