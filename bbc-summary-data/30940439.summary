Ched Evans: Threat to Oldham Athletic sponsor at time of talks

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A sponsor of Oldham Athletic received a "threat to damage" while the club was working on a deal to sign convicted rapist Ched Evans, police have said.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A spokesman said the sponsor, which has not been named, received the threat on 5 January.
The League One club pulled out of an attempt to sign the former Wales international a few days later.
Greater Manchester Police said a formal complaint had been made, which officers were investigating.
Evans, 26, was released from prison in October after serving half of a five-year sentence for a rape conviction.
Oldham Athletic owner Simon Corney said there was an "80% chance" of signing Evans on 7 January, before pulling out of the deal the following day after death threats were made to club employees and sponsors threatened to withdraw their support.
Evans continues to protest his innocence, and an investigation into his conviction by the Criminal Cases Review Commission is under way.
