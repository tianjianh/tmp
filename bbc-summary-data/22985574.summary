The 23-year-old has agreed a two-year deal, with the option of a third year, and will link up with the Super League club for pre-season in November.
"We have been keeping an eye on Sam for a while and have been impressed with what we have seen," said Warriors head coach Shaun Wane.
"It is a big step for him to make the move from the Championship but he is  very determined and driven."
Wane added: "I am confident under the guidance of our quality backroom staff he has both the ability and passion to become a success as a full-time professional."
Hopkins joined the Centurions from amateur club Leigh East and has been a regular for the Championship side since 2011.
"The Warriors are the biggest club in Super League and when I learned of their interest in me and the chance to progress my career with them, it was an easy decision to make," he said.
"I am looking forward to the remainder of the season with the Centurions and can assure everyone of my commitment to try and achieve success with them for the remainder of the current season."
