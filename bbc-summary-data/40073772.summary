Resuming 244 runs behind on 37-1, Gloucestershire had some hope when Cameron Bancroft's 50 saw them to 98-1.
But then five wickets fell for 19 runs and Notts saw off the tail end after Phil Mustard (49) and Kieran Noema-Barnett's 53-run seventh-wicket stand.
Steven Mullaney (5-32) impressed as the hosts stayed top of Division Two.
Notts have now won four of their opening five matches to remain top of the table by 13 points from Worcestershire, who also won inside thee days at Northampton.
They are back in four-day action this Friday with a game at home to one of their local East Midlands rivals, winless Derbyshire.
Gloucestershire head coach Richard Dawson told BBC Sport:
"I've just said to our boys that to compete in four-day cricket you've got to do two things well.
"You've got to be able to put pressure on with the ball and to be able to handle pressure with the bat, when you are up against it.
"They did it much better than us and that's very much as simple as it gets. They never let us off the hook."
Nottinghamshire's Steven Mullaney told BBC Sport:
"I certainly didn't expect that to happen. Conditions suited my type of bowling so it was nice to get a few overs under the belt and help the team towards 24 points.
"All five bowlers have done their bit in this match but it's me getting the plaudits. It's my first five-wicket haul since league cricket in about 2008.
"It was swinging nicely and we kept the ball in great condition and the wicket had a bit in it throughout."
