[SN]TITLE[SN]
Man to stand trial over rape of 14-year-old in Barrhead

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A 20-year-old man is to stand trial next year charged with raping a 14-year-old girl in Barrhead.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Samuel Ciornei denies attacking the teenager near a supermarket in the Renfrewshire town on 7 August.
The charge includes claims that Mr Ciornei got hold of the girl's bike, grabbed her by the hair and threatened her with a piece of glass.
Prosecutors allege he then made her crawl into bushes and held her down before raping her.
Mr Ciornei, who is originally from Romania, faces a separate assault and robbery charge.
It includes claims that he "forcibly" took the girl's bag and stole it, along with a bike helmet.
A number of locations in Barrhead are listed in the charges - one being an "an area of bushes" at the back of an Iceland supermarket.
Louise Arrol, defending, pled not guilty on Mr Ciornei's behalf during a short hearing at the High Court in Glasgow.
Judge Lord Burns set a trial date for June next year.
