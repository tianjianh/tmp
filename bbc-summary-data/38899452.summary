Father 'fatally hurt baby as mother showered'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A six-week-old girl was dealt a fatal head injury by her teenage father while her mother took a shower, a court has heard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Jemma Pethybridge, 19, returned to find baby Ezmai not breathing at her flat in Bordon, Hampshire, in June 2015.
The infant had also apparently been "deliberately shaken" and had suffered rib injuries, Winchester Crown Court was told.
Ezmai's father, Joshua Martin, 19, of Salisbury Road, Alton, denies murder.
Opening the trial for the prosecution, William Mousley QC said Ezmai had been in the care of her father at the couple's home in New Road.
Miss Pethybridge returned from the bathroom after 20 minutes to find her baby lifeless and with "milky vomit" coming from her nose and mouth.
The court heard a recording of the mother's 999 call, during which the call handler advised Mr Martin how to administer chest compressions while they waited for the paramedic to arrive.
Ezmai died after being transferred St George's Hospital, London the following day.
She had a head injury which had caused a subdural haemorrhage and severe brain damage.
She also had bloodshot eyes, "consistent with being shaken", and had eight bruised or fractured ribs, which were not damaged by the chest compressions, the jury was told.
The court heard Mr Martin "trashed" the flat while his partner and daughter were at the Royal Surrey County Hospital in Guildford, overturning furniture and pulling down curtains.
In interviews with the police, Miss Pethybridge said she believed Mr Martin was mentally younger than his age and had a temper which he sometimes could not control.
Mr Mousley said although no attack was witnessed, there was no other possibility than that Mr Martin had caused Ezmai's injuries.
The trial continues.
