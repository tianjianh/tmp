Jill Pirrie is understood to have been knocked down on her way home from work at the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh on Old Dalkeith Road on Thursday.
The car involved was a silver Ford Ka that was being followed by a police car with blue lights and siren activated.
It is understood Ms Pirrie, a 33-year-old nurse, has a young son.
Officers appealed for witnesses to the incident that took place at about 20:00 BST.
Her family said: "Jill was a loving mother, daughter, partner and friend who will be hugely missed by the many who knew and loved her.
"She was well known for her great sense of humour and no words can express the void that is left as a result of this tragedy.
Jim Crombie, NHS Lothian chief officer of acute services, said: "We are deeply saddened and shocked by this truly tragic incident and our thoughts and sympathies are with Jill's family at this sad time.
"Jill was a talented, well liked and respected member of our theatres team and her colleagues and friends are devastated.
"The Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh is a close-knit community and this has sent shockwaves through the site."
Ch Supt Kenny Macdonald, of Police Scotland, said: "We reported this collision to the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service, who have instructed the Police Investigations and Review Commissioner to carry out an independent investigation.
"PIRC are instructed to investigate deaths following police contact or involvement, and we will cooperate fully with their inquiry.
"Our sincere condolences are with Jill's family and friends at this tragic time, and we will utilise all resources at our disposal to investigate this collision."
A spokesman said: "The police vehicle had activated its blue lights and siren after the Ford Ka, travelling northbound, failed to stop when signalled to do so by officers on Old Dalkeith Road.
"A 33-year-old woman was taken to the Edinburgh Royal Infirmary where she was sadly pronounced dead a short time later."
Ch Supt Kenny Macdonald, added: "We reported this collision to the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service, who have instructed the Police Investigations and Review Commissioner to carry out an independent investigation.
"PIRC are instructed to investigate deaths following police contact or involvement, and we will cooperate fully with their inquiry.
"Our sincere condolences are with the family and friends of the woman at this tragic time, and we will utilise all resources at our disposal to investigate this collision."
The road remained closed as officers carried out investigations at the scene.
Derek Clapperton told BBC Scotland he heard the crash.
He said: "I was in the back green last night painting my hut and doing my garden when I heard this big thud.
"I went round the corner and down to the bottom of the road. There was a grey car. There were two boys lying outside the car and the lassie was next to a wee wall.
"The medics were trying to revive her, three of them. The two boys were lying on the ground both bleeding and the car was right against the wall, smashed up."
A spokeswoman for the Police Investigations and Review Commissioner (PIRC) said: "A police vehicle was following a silver Ford Ka when the Ka was involved in a collision which resulted in the death of a 33-year-old woman in Edinburgh.
"The Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service (COPFS) has instructed the PIRC to carry out an independent investigation into the circumstances leading up to the incident.
"PIRC investigators attended the scene in the early hours of the morning and a report will be submitted to the COPFS in due course."
