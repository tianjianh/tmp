Paramedics were called to Millennium Town Park in St Helier, Jersey, at 15:51 BST on Monday and the boy was later flown to hospital in Southampton.
The woman, 38, was held on suspicion of road traffic law offences and has been bailed, Jersey Police said.
The boy, who was visiting the island with his family from the UK, remains in a critical condition in hospital.
Police said they have taken statements from a number of witnesses, but were appealing for anyone else who saw the crash and any owner of premises with CCTV in the area to come forward.
