Arthur Roy Taylor, known as Archie, left his accommodation at about 09:30 BST on Saturday to take his boat out from Gwbert boat club in Ceredigion.
A costal search was called off on Sunday after his vessel was found but Mr Taylor is "still unaccounted for".
The coastguard had said on Sunday further searches were "unlikely".
But a spokesman did add the search would resume if "new evidence comes to light".
Dyfed-Powys Police have appealed for video or photos taken by members of the public in the Gwbert area on Saturday morning as they may have captured Mr Taylor sailing.
He is 5' 4", of slim build, has grey hair and was last seen wearing a navy jumper and dark grey waterproof jacket.
