In the only change to the back line, winger O'Mahony replaces Keith Earls who took a knock to the ribs in training this week.
Tommy O'Donnell is selected ahead of Jack O'Donoghue in the back row while James Cronin comes in at loose-head.
Pool leaders Munster have qualified while Racing are out of contention.
They secured their 16th European quarter-final in 19 seasons by beating Glasgow Warriors 14-12 at Scotstoun last weekend.
With extra seating installed, there will be a 26,200 sell-out crowd in Limerick where former Munster fly-half Ronan O'Gara will be in the opposition dug-out as part of the French club's coaching staff.
The match will be Munster's 60th top-level European game at Thomond Park, the Irish side having lost just four of the previous matches.
