Frances Cappuccini inquest: Dr Nadeem Azeez 'made a mistake before'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A doctor caring for a woman who died following childbirth had made a mistake seven months earlier, an inquest heard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Frances Cappuccini suffered a fatal haemorrhage at Tunbridge Wells hospital after an emergency Caesarean in 2012.
The original NHS report into her death stated another woman had suffered a haemorrhage in Dr Nadeem Azeez' care.
It said he had mismanaged her resuscitation and it was recommended he have a period of supervised practice.
Consultant anaesthetist Errol Cornish was cleared of gross negligence manslaughter and Maidstone and Tunbridge Wells NHS Trust was cleared of corporate manslaughter last January.
The inquest at Gravesend Old Town Hall heard details of the earlier mistake had been removed from the report given to Mrs Cappuccini's family, the coroner and the strategic health authority.
Neil Sheldon, the family's lawyer, asked Karen Woods, the nurse who compiled the report, if she took it out.
"I don't remember personally taking it out," she answered.
He suggested to her that it was done "because, for the trust, it was an embarrassment".
Ms Woods denied this, saying it "would go against all my personal and professional integrity".
She went on to say no pressure had been applied to anyone at any stage to remove the section from the document.
The coroner will deliver his findings on Monday.
