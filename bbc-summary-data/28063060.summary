The fee has not been publicly disclosed but BBC London 94.9 understands the figure to be £1m, which is a club record for the Bees.
The 20-year-old was an ever-present for Orient last season, scoring 12 goals in 57 appearances.
"We have been very impressed with his quality and his consistency," Bees boss Mark Warburton told the club website.
"Moses is a young player with a lot of development potential. I am sure he will prove to be an exciting addition."
Odubajo came through Orient's youth system and made his debut for the League One club in September 2011.
The Greenwich-born wide man broke into Russell Slade's side at right-back but progressed to playing on the wing.
Odubajo impressed for the O's last season, winning the Football League Young Player of the Month award for April and scoring in the League One play-off final.
In total he scored 16 goals in 116 games for Orient, who lost on penalties to Rotherham in the play-off final in May after finishing the season in third place in the table.
"He has excellent physical abilities and a real desire to move forward in the game," added Warburton.
BBC London understands Odubajo attracted interest from a number of clubs, with Brentford's bid the highest received by the east Londoners.
The fee for Obudajo surpasses the £750,000 Brentford paid to Crystal Palace for defender Hermann Hreidarsson in 1998.
