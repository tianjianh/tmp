[SN]TITLE[SN]
Guernsey without national newspapers for fourth day

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Guernsey has had no national newspapers for the fourth day out of five because of a technical fault with the delivery plane.

The flight left Luton at around 12:00 GMT on Monday, but was diverted to Jersey where the papers were offloaded.
Operated by Atlantic Airlines, the aircraft has failed to arrive seven times since December, with all but one instance due to technical problems.
The BBC has approached the firm for comment.
The director of Guernsey's distributor said it was the worst he had seen it.
Brian Lowe, from Le Gallez, said: "In the 36 years I've been in the wholesale business in Guernsey I have never known three consecutive technical problems like we have experienced in the past few days."
However, he told the BBC he was optimistic that an improved service would run on Tuesday because publishers had been "rattling a few cages" and increasing pressure on the airline.
Currently national newspapers are printed in the UK, though from May they will be printed in Jersey.
Stuart Douglas, the President of the National Federation of Newsagents in Guernsey, said while delays in winter were expected, the recent cancellations were affecting profits.
He said: "The papers don't come in, we can't distribute them, we can't make any money".
