A project to transform a former railway shed in Stirling into a building conservation training centre has taken a step forward with the appointment of a contractor.

Esh Border Construction has joined the £8.9m Engine Shed project in Forthside.
Historic Scotland wants to transform the disused shed into an education centre for building conservation in Scotland.
The facility would also engage with the public through events and exhibitions.
The broad range of training offered at the Engine Shed would include a new postgraduate-level qualification in technical conservation.
Historic Scotland said there is currently a "real skills gap" in the Scottish construction industry to deal with the 450,000 traditionally-constructed buildings around the country, many of which are still in use.
They said 5,000 traditionally-skilled workers were needed to meet demand for contractors in the industry.
David Mitchell, director of conservation at Historic Scotland, said the Engine Shed would be "a leading hub for building conservation on both a national and international level".
He said: "Our aspiration is to create a place that anyone with an interest in traditional buildings, skills and materials will be able to enjoy.
"Our cutting edge science and digital documentation work will mix with centuries-old skills, demonstrating that both have a role to play in the future.
"We want to demonstrate the benefits of traditional forms of construction and their continued potential for economic growth and we're pleased that Esh Border Construction will be working with us over the coming year, helping to deliver the Engine Shed project."
Historic Environment Scotland, a new body aimed at investigating, caring for and promoting the country's historic environment, comes into being from October this year.
Construction on the Engine Shed project is due to be complete by summer 2016.
