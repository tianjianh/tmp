Dorset Police 'worst in UK' for criminal record check targets

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Dorset Police has the worst figures in the UK for carrying out criminal record checks on time, latest government figures have shown.

In May, the police force carried out 25% of required checks within the maximum 60 days, the worst figure out of 50 forces across a 10-month range.
It means delays for Dorset residents waiting to start a job that requires such a background check.
Dorset Police blamed staff turnover and an increase in applications.
Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS) checks are required for anyone working or volunteering with children and vulnerable adults.
The targets are for 85% of checks to be completed in 14 days, 90% in 18 days, 95% in 25 days and 100% of checks completed in 60 days.
Latest statistics from the DBS show Dorset Police failed to meet its 60 day target five times from July 2014 to May 2015.
Figures for April and May show Dorset met 33% and 25% of its target respectively - these are the lowest percentages the statistics have recorded out of 50 forces across its 10-month range.
The vast majority of forces completed all their targets, the figures show.
The DBS said it was "reliant on the police to carry out their checks within agreed timescales" and that most of the complaints it receives was to do with "turnaround times linked to poor police performance".
A Dorset Police spokesman said its DBS unit was "currently experiencing a delay in processing applications... caused in part by a turnover in staff and an increase in the volume of applications".
He added: "Dorset Police understands the frustration created by this delay and apologises to anyone inconvenienced."
