Radio 1 DJ B Traits, 2 Many DJs, Tensnake and Eli & Fur also performed at Groove Loch Ness.
The 5,000-ticket event was held in a field at Dores near Inverness used by the RockNess festival, which has not been held since 2013.
Groove Loch Ness was organised in just eight months by four people working in the music industry in Scotland.
Groove Armada closed the festival which ran through until 02:00.
Police estimated about 4,500 festival-goers attended the event, which they said passed without significant incident.
Officers carried out 31 positive drugs searches over the course of the day and dealt with only one report of minor disorder.
