The boy, from the Taunton area, was arrested and bailed following an enquiry into "allegations he made, including on social media", police said.
"The arrest was made to safeguard the individual," a police spokesman said.
Heathfield Community School said the matter had been taken "very seriously" and the boy was "not in school".
The school's headmaster Peter Hoare also reassured concerned parents that "all the right steps" had been taken to "ensure the safety of everyone at the school".
"We are confident that appropriate steps have been taken and the school will be open as usual and attendance is expected," he said.
The teenager's mother told the BBC that "everything has been out of proportion" and said she was "adamant that threats were not made."
