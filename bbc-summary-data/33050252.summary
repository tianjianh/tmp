He replaces Honour Janza, who led the side at the Nations Cup finals in Equatorial Guinea this year.
The move comes just a day after Janza lead Chipolopolo to a 1-0 win over Ethiopia in an international friendly.
Lwandamina is the current coach of club side Zesco United, who lie second in the Zambian Super League.
Janza has been given a new role in charge of the Football Association of Zambia's (Faz) development programmes.
The football association is continuing its search for a permanent replacement for Janza and said in a statement: "Updates on the announcement of the new head trainer will be given over the coming weeks."
"FAZ wishes to thank Honour Janza for the work undertaken during his time as coach of the Chipolopolo.
"Janza remains a vital cog in the development initiatives the association continues to pursue in augmenting the development programmes that are taking our football forward and believe that his return to the Technical Department will reenergize the programmes that require his expertise and other stakeholders."
In March Janza told BBC sport that he felt "betrayed" by Faz who announced it wanted to employ a foreign coach, however the association refuted his concerns.
