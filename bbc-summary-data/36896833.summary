[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Durham claimed a vital victory over Warwickshire in the One-Day Cup despite a List A career-best 107 from Sam Hain.

The hosts clinched a four-wicket win as fifties from Mark Stoneman, Scott Borthwick and Paul Collingwood saw them chase down 293 with 14 balls spare.
Batting first, Hain shared a 143-run third-wicket stand with Tim Ambrose (86), as the visitors made 292-7.
However, Collingwood's game-changing 53 off 33 balls, which included five fours and three sixes, helped Durham home.
After putting Warwickshire in to bat at Gosforth, Chris Rushworth (2-65) gave Durham the ideal start as he had William Porterfield caught behind for six.
Hain, who has played just seven List A matches, reached three figures off 110 balls, with his measured innings including 13 fours before he was bowled by Keaton Jennings.
Rikki Clarke's late burst of 24 off 14 balls was hindered by Ateeq Javid and Jeetan Patel both falling for ducks to Usman Arshad (3-50).
Durham's batsmen all played their part in securing victory but it was captain Collingwood, who recently signed a new one-year extension with county, who propelled them towards their target reaching his half-century with a four laced past mid-off.
Despite Collingwood edging to third-man off Clarke, debutant wicketkeeper Stuart Poynter was on hand to send his sixth delivery to the boundary as Durham kept up their chase for a quarter-final spot.
