Paul Simmons-Turner, 38, was targeted outside the Mariott Hotel in Waltham Abbey, Essex, last December.
The inquest heard he was shot through the lip and tongue before getting in a passing car and asking for help.
No arrests have been made in connection with his death, which is being treated as murder.
Mr Simmons-Turner, from east London,  was pronounced dead in the car park of The Volunteer pub, about a mile from the hotel where he had spent the previous night with his girlfriend.
Police said he was driven to the pub car park by a father and his disabled daughter after jumping into their car and asking to be taken to a hospital, but the suspect's car cut in front of them and Mr Simmons-Turner was shot a second time in the chest.
A post-mortem examination found he died from gunshot wounds.
