The 23-year-old has made 44 appearances for the Hatters since joining from West Ham in 2015 and helped them reach the League Two play-offs last term.
Potts scored his first goal for Luton in the play-off semi-final against Blackpool, but it was not enough as the Tangerines won 6-5 on aggregate.
"I'm delighted to get it done and now I look forward to next season," he said.
"There wasn't any doubt in my mind that it wasn't going to get signed."
