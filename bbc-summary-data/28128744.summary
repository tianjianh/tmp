Arthur Jones, 73, from Denbigh, has not been seen since 19 June two days after arriving in Crete and sending a postcard telling his family he was planning a walking trip.
Speaking at Prime Minister's Question Time, Mr Cameron said he would talk to the Foreign Office to make sure help was available.
Local MP Chris Ruane raised the case.
Mr Ruane said Mr Jones's family were "frantic with worry" since Mr Jones went missing. He asked David Cameron to ensure the FCO continued their excellent work and co-operate with the Greek government "to make sure that Arthur is found".
The prime minister said: "I will certainly do everything I can to help you with your constituent and have discussions with the Foreign Office about all the consular assistance that is being given and anything else that they can do."
Earlier, North Wales Police appealed to anyone who had been on holiday in Crete or was going to report any sightings Mr Jones during their time there.
They  said holidaymakers who had returned could contact them with information, and urged anyone going who might see Mr Jones to speak to the police locally.
They are assisting police locally in Crete.
On Tuesday Mr Jones' family said they were hopeful a local TV appeal on the island would lead to more sightings.
Mr Jones, a keen walker, was staying in the city of Chania. Despite his plans, possessions he would have used to go walking were still in his room.
Det Sgt Haydn Williams from North Wales Police said: "Arthur is keen walker and could be anywhere in Crete. The Crete Police and Arthur's family have become increasingly concerned for Arthur's welfare.
"I'm hoping our appeal will be seen by holidaymakers or other travellers who visited the island between 17 and 24 June and who may have information about his whereabouts to contact us and we can pass on to local police.
"I'd also appeal to anyone who is planning to visit Crete in the near future to consider the plight of Arthur's family and report any sightings or information to local police on the island.
"Arthur's family are being supported by North Wales Police and I'm sure they will be very grateful for any assistance the public are able to provide."
Mr Jones is described as 5'6" tall, medium build with short grey hair and a grey moustache.
His son Jeff from Prestatyn and others have been handing out 1,000 leaflets on the island, hoping British tourists will remember bumping into Mr Jones.
People in Denbigh are due to hold a candlelit vigil on Thursday for Mr Jones.
