[SN]TITLE[SN]
Grimsby Town 2-1 Cambridge United

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Goals from Calum Dyson and Chris Clements gave returning Grimsby manager Russell Slade a 2-1 win in his first game in charge against Cambridge.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
On-loan Everton striker Dyson gave the hosts the lead from the penalty spot before Clements wrapped up the points, with Brad Halliday grabbing a late consolation for Shaun Derry's side.
After an even first half with few chances, Grimsby began the second half brightly as Jamey Osborne saw a curling effort from the edge of the box deflected over for a corner.
And it was the midfielder who won a penalty moments later as he was brought down by Conor Newton, giving Dyson the chance to slam the ball past goalkeeper Will Norris.
Medy Elito was presented with a chance to bring Cambridge level seconds after coming on as a substitute, but his first-time shot was well-saved by James McKeown.
Clements made it 2-0 late on as he slotted home from Osborne's cutback, but Halliday set up a grandstand finish as he headed in late on.
Grimsby managed to hang onto their lead, though, as Slade made the perfect start to his second stint at Blundell Park.
