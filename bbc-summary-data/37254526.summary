Truro City: Lee Hodges wants more ruthlessness when leading games

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Truro City must be more ruthless when leading games, says boss Lee Hodges.

The White Tigers have won just one of their opening seven games in National League South, despite taking the lead in two of their last three games.
"You don't become a bad team overnight," Hodges told BBC Cornwall.
"We've been a little bit disappointed in taking those leads and then giving them away, so we've got to make sure that once we take those leads then that's it, game over."
Hodges has yet to guide Truro to a win at home this season since taking over at Treyew Road for the second time in the summer.
City's only victory of the season so far was a 2-0 win at bottom-of-the-table Concord Rangers.
"It's getting it across to these lads that once we've taken the lead let's carry on doing exactly what we're doing that's getting the positives," added Hodges.
"But it seems as though we changed the way we're playing from being positive to a little bit of negative and that's costing us at the moment."
