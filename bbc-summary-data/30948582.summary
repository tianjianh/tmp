Saudi Arabia: Lashings, hawks and friends in high places

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Prime Minister David Cameron and Prince Charles are heading to Saudi Arabia to join world leaders paying respects to the country's King Abdullah - who died on Thursday.

He was the world's longest reigning monarch, but ruled one of the most oppressive countries.
Just days ago, blogger Raif Badawi was lashed 50 times for "cybercrime" and "insulting Islam". He faces 1000 lashes in total.
Here's what else you need to know about Saudi Arabia:
Saudi Arabia is one of the world's biggest oil producers, which is why it is such a wealthy nation.
It sits on more than 25% of the world's known oil reserves. It is currently able to produce more than 10 million barrels per day.
King Abdullah's death caused a spike in oil prices because uncertainty makes markets volatile.
King Abdullah had very close ties with the US, largely driven by Saudi Arabia's oil power and America's security strength.
The two nations also had a common enemy in  al-Qaeda, the terror group behind the 9/11 attacks on the US back in 2001.
Of the 19 hijackers, 15 were Saudis, including Osama bin Laden. Abdullah eventually beat back al-Qaeda, forcing them to flee to Yemen.
In a statement, George H W Bush called Abdullah a "wise and reliable ally." Tony Blair also released a statement saying the king was "loved".
Westminster Abbey and the Foreign Office are two of the British institutions flying their flags at half mast.
David Cameron and Barack Obama have paid tribute to Abdullah.
Away from politics, Kim Kardashian is reportedly being paid $1m (Â£667,347) to spend an evening with a Saudi prince.
Prince Alwaleed bin Talal of Saudi Arabia might have been listed at number 26 with $20bn (Â£15bn) on the Forbes rich list, but that was not good enough for the Saudi businessman.
He claimed he was worth $9bn (Â£6m) more and threatened to sever all links with the magazine.
In one letter, his chief financial officer wrote: "Forbes is putting down the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and that is a slap in the face of modernity and progress."
Forbes refused to make the changes.
The Saudi royal family own the sixth largest super yacht in the world, the Prince Abdulaziz.
The 5,200-tonne yacht has a deck that is said to resemble the Titanic. It also has a mosque, a cinema and a hospital on board.
Falconry is a popular hobby in the Middle East, so fashionable that a hawk seat (yes, a seat for a hawk) has been developed for private jets.
Lufthansa Technik has come up with a gadget for those who want to keep their bird of prey by their side when travelling.
Called the Falcon Master, the platform and stand for transporting falcons or other birds can slot above a folded-down seat in a range of Airbus or Boeing aircraft.
Citizens of Saudi Arabia are some of the biggest users of Twitter. There are 2.4 million active users, the most in the Arab world, according to the Mohammed bin Rashid School of Government in Dubai.
One of the reasons ordinary Saudis say they like using Twitter is because it allows them to discuss what they really feel.
The hashtag #WhydidTwittersucceedinSaudiArabia began trending a year ago, with users sharing their reasons they liked the site.
One user tweeted: "People need an outlet to express themselves, to start to disclose what's hidden and drop the masks, without fear or commands, or censorship from anyone."
Another posted: "The reason is that none of the newspapers are concerned with your worries nor do any officials care about you."
The new King Salman wasted no time in changing his Twitter handle, suspending his old account @HRHPSalman to @KingSalman. He has 1.27m followers and follows no one.
Google Maps was rapid too. Within 24 hours of the news Prince Salman road was changed to King Salman road.
Some of the tributes to King Abdullah have described him as a "great reformer".
Christine Lagarde, head of the IMF (International Monetary Fund), an organisation which controls the world's money, said: "In a very discreet way, he was a strong advocate of women.
"It was very gradual, appropriately so probably for the country. I discussed that issue with him several times and he was a strong believer."
While King Abdullah did appoint 30 women to a council which could make recommendations to the government, they were still unable to drive themselves to work.
However in 2013 Saudi Arabia's religious police lifted a ban on women riding bicycles and motorbikes, but only in recreational areas and while dressed in full Islamic veil and accompanied by a male relative, it's claimed.
Saudi Arabia has a male guardianship system, which means that women cannot apply for a passport, marry, travel, or access higher education without male approval.
Some hospitals also require male consent for women to receive treatment.
Human Rights Watch released a statement on King Abdullah's death saying: "King Abdullah came to power promising reforms, but his agenda fell far short of achieving lasting institutional gains on basic rights for Saudi citizens."
It's probably advisable to read  this advice on the UK government's website before you travel.
Bringing porn magazines with you is forbidden, as is bacon (or any pork products, should you have a stick of pepperoni in your hand luggage).
If you get off the plane drunk you could be imprisoned too.
A Filipino man was sentenced to jail and 75 lashings for bringing two chocolate bars containing alcohol into the country.
He claimed he had bought the chocolates on a flight stopover and hadn't realised they were alcoholic.
Men should not wear shorts in public and women should wear loose fitting clothing. Saudi Arabia carries the death penalty for importing drugs.
