The four-time major winner from Holywood eagled the second hole before dropping eight shots to lie 13 behind leader Rickie Fowler in tied 143rd.
McIlroy said: "It was just one of those days. My timing was a little bit off. I started missing some left and tried to correct it and missed a couple right."
Graeme McDowell is four over with Shane Lowry one under.
Former US Open champion McDowell posted five bogeys to go with a solitary birdie at the 13th.
Ireland's Paul Dunne opened with 75 on the Wisconsin course.
McIlroy, the 2011 champion, was returning after a month out with a rib injury and his round started in perfect fashion with an eagle-two on the par-four second after driving the green.
However, a bogey followed at the third and he had two double bogeys on his back nine after hitting his ball into the thigh-deep fescue rough.
Prior to the tournament, the 28-year-old Northern Irishman had defended the severity of the rough, saying the fairways were "the widest played at a US Open" and "if we can't hit within that avenue, you might as well pack your bags and go home".
After his round, McIlroy, who hit just five fairways to tie for last in the 156-man field in that category, said: "I don't think I hit a fairway from the 10th and you cannot play this golf course if you are not in position off the tee."
