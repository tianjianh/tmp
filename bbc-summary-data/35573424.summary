Shaul scored a try as his team beat Catalan Dragons 38-10 in Perpignan.
The Super League side tweeted: "Special mention to @jamieshaul and partner, Chloe, who have had their first child tonight! Daddy missed the birth to play! #congratulations".
Shaul, 23, said it had been a "special moment" to come home to his son Teddy.
Hull chartered their own plane to Perpignan and arrived back at Leeds/Bradford Airport just before midnight on Saturday.
Hull FC coach Lee Radford said Shaul had put in a performance worthy of missing the birth of his first child as the Black and Whites' scored seven tries to grab their first win in France for six years.
"I said to him prior to the game that he would have to have an absolute blinder because he will show this game back to his son for the rest of his life," Radford told BBC Radio Humberside.
"I said make sure it is a performance that you can look back on with pride, and he did that."
