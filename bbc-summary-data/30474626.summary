Britain - a nation of online shopkeepers?

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Britain spends more money online than the world's other major economies, according to the latest report by regulator Ofcom.

Averaging nearly £2,000 per person each year, Britons spend considerably more than the second highest spending Australians (£1,356) and perhaps surprisingly, more than the Americans - at £1,171.
Ofcom says it's due to two factors: nearly eight out of 10 households have access to high-speed broadband and Britons are more comfortable using credit cards. Certainly one of their statistics about internet penetration is striking: digital radio covers 95% of the population.
Unsurprisingly, a record 40% of advertising is spent online, more than other countries. And online retailers are growing. Ocado recently surpassed £1bn in sales as larger numbers of people order their groceries online.
The business and marketing firms that I have spoken to on Talking Business describe the rise of the internet as game-changing.
Consumer spending habits are shifting, and it's also cheaper to start a business online. When pressed if it means the end of "brick and mortar" stores, the response is "no".
Still, there are stores that have shut down due to cheaper online competition and empty high streets have prompted cuts in business rates. There are, of course, many failed internet start-ups too, just like other businesses.
The consensus seems to be that stores need to diversify their strategies to cater to online customers and develop their websites for new platforms, including mobile.
An emerging consumption pattern is a hybrid one, where customers will hit the shops and look online. I heard that customers will go to a physical store and then buy the product online, or browse online and then check it out physically before purchasing it in a store. Recent problems with courier companies have led to people picking up their groceries that were ordered online.
One result of the rise of online retail is that jobs will be found where new businesses emerge, and many are now digital.
Strikingly, according to the agencies promoting London, they report that over a quarter of jobs created since the recession are in the technology and digital sector.
London's initiative to develop a high tech cluster, Tech City, has led to double-digit growth in new business start-ups targeted by the capital's investment in this area.
Concentration in one locale such as the colloquially-dubbed Silicon Roundabout is typical of how tech companies operate, and London reportedly attracts an impressive one-fifth of tech investment that goes to Europe.
2014 looks like another record year for start-ups: around half a million new businesses have already been incorporated, according to Companies House.
The employment statistics also reflect this trend. According to the Office for National Statistics, around two-thirds of the jobs created since the recession are in self-employment.
As compared with the first three months of 2008, there are 1.1 million more workers. Of which, 732,000 were from an increase in self-employment versus a rise in employees by 339,000.
The ONS also finds that the largest increases in the self-employed were in professional, scientific, and technical activities. Hard-hit construction is still the largest sector for self-employment, followed by cab drivers and carpenters/joiners. London has the highest proportion of self-employed people, over 17%.
But, being self-employed can be tough. It's particularly the case when a recession and high unemployment have dented employment prospects.
The proportion of those in self-employment is the highest in 40 years, but there are more older workers among the ranks and over a million people who are in part-time work, but wish for full-time jobs.
The ONS estimates that self-employed wages have fallen by 22% since 2008 and average £207 per week or just £10,700 per year.
Measurement, though, tends to underestimate self-employed income as there are usually a number of sources and the data depends on recall. Of course, those who work for themselves don't receive benefits that employees do, such as paid leave.
As more customers buy online, it won't be surprising that businesses emerge to cater to those spenders. We may soon find out if Britain's traditional retailers will feel the pinch over the holidays too.
In the US, retailers were hit on Black Friday, the busiest shopping day of the year after Thanksgiving, by competition from online shopping. Sales plummeted by some 11%.
An online shopping initiative, China's Singles Day in November also breaks new records for internet sales each year.
Boxing Day in Britain, a traditionally busy shopping day after Christmas, could be next to reveal the extent of Britain becoming a nation of online shoppers, and perhaps also of online shopkeepers.
