New Redruth head coach Marek Churcher says he will be judging whether the season is a success by how well his side do away from the Rec.

The Reds recorded an unprecedented nine away wins as they finished fourth in National Two South last season.
"One of the measures for us as a group of players is how we win on the road and how many we win on the road," Churcher told BBC Radio Cornwall.
"We've got to carry that form forward this year."
Churcher added: "If we finish anywhere near where we did last year that will be brilliant and that's a really good sentiment for the club."
He only took on the role a fortnight ago after Steven Larkins stepped down because of work commitments, but says their close relationship means taking over was not a difficult job.
"We work together day in and day out at Truro College, so the transition for me to take over is pretty easy," continued Churcher.
"I did a lot of the coaching last year and Steve would just oversee it, so we sung off the same hymn sheet so it was quite a natural progression and one that I'm happy to step in and do."
