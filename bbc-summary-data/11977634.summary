The Metropolitan Police said they may have taken part in violent disorder, during which police officers were attacked and buildings vandalised.
Officers are reviewing hours of CCTV footage as part of their investigations into a series of student protests.
They are asking for the public's help in identifying the suspects.
Det Ch Supt Matthew Horne said: "We want the public to help us identify these people who may have been involved in violent disorder, attacking police officers and smashing buildings, shops and windows.
"The vast majority of the people we are seeking are suspected of committing serious offences of violent disorder and criminal damage."
He added: "The rights of protest and expression are important to us all. However, people breaking the law, endangering those protesting peacefully and committing offences such as this are criminals."
Scotland Yard has launched a "major criminal investigation", called Operation Malone, into all the tuition fee protests held from 10 November, when students stormed Tory headquarters in Millbank, up to Thursday's demonstration in Parliament Square.
A total of 175 people were arrested during the four demonstrations, including 34 who were detained on Thursday.
The most recent protests, which coincided with a vote in the House of Commons on removing the tuition fees cap, involved the worst violence.
MPs had voted to allow fees to treble to up to Â£9,000 in England.
Protesters largely took over Parliament Square, where mounted police were used to control crowds and at one point charged a group of demonstrators.
Protesters threw flares, sticks, snooker balls and paint balls, according to police. After nightfall, riot police forced back people who were smashing windows at the Treasury and the Supreme Court.
Then at 1915 GMT, protesters launched an attack on a car carrying Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall as it passed along Regent Street. The Rolls Royce was kicked, splashed with paint and a window was smashed to chants of "off with their heads".
Prime Minister David Cameron has said the rioters should face the "full force of the law".
Meanwhile, the Independent Police Complaints Commission is investigating a claim that 20-year-old Middlesex University student Alfie Meadows suffered serious head injuries after being hit on the head with a police truncheon.
Police are urging people who can identify any of the suspects whose pictures it has released to call 020 8358 0100 or Crimestoppers on 0800 555111.
