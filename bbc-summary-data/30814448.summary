Probe after woman 'sets herself on fire' at police office

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Prosecutors have ordered an independent investigation after a 58-year-old woman apparently set herself on fire at a police station in West Dunbartonshire.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The woman suffered serious burns in the incident in the reception area of Clydebank police station, in the town's Montrose Street, on 7 January.
She is still being treated for her injuries at Glasgow Royal Infirmary.
The Police Investigations and Review Commissioner will look at the circumstances surrounding the incident.
A report into the findings of the investigation will then be submitted to the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service.
Meanwhile, officials at West Dunbartonshire Council are carrying out their own inquiry as the woman is known to have been in touch with council services in the hours before she went to the police station.
