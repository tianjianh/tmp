Euro 2016: Wales have to get over Sweden loss - Aaron Ramsey

Wales midfielder Aaron Ramsey says it was good to get their 3-0 friendly defeat by Sweden "out of their system" prior to Euro 2016.

In their last seven matches, Wales have failed to score in four of them and won just once, against Andorra in October.
Chris Coleman's side face Slovakia in their first Group B game at Euro 2016 on Saturday, 11 June (17:00 BST).
"Obviously we're going to have to play a lot better than we did [against Sweden]," Ramsey told BBC Wales Sport.
He continued, "In these friendlies you always see a mixed result.
"In a way it's good to get it out of the system now and now we can look forward to going to the Euros and show what we're capable of doing."
Despite the defeat, the Arsenal midfielder says Wales believe they can improve in the coming weeks at their first major international tournament since 1958.
"Now we can look forward to France and enjoy that," said Arsenal's Ramsey.
"We know we're going to have to improve on the performance, but we're confident we are capable doing that."
Reading defender Chris Gunter, who played the full 90 minutes in the defeat in Stockholm, says the performance will not overshadow Wales' pre-tournament preparations.
"We're not daft enough to think this result will change any preparation for Saturday," said Gunter.
"Hopefully this game will be out of the system by then. We've worked too hard to be negative by this point."
Although their form has been inconsistent in the run-up to the trip to France, Gunter does not believe another defeat against Slovakia would be a disaster for Wales.
"It's the first one in the group where you want to pick up points," he added.
In a three-game group, every game is important, but if we win that game [v Slovakia] it doesn't mean we'll go on and win the tournament.
"Likewise, if we don't get the three points then it doesn't mean we're going to have a bad tournament."
