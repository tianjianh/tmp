Wylfa nuclear reactor shutdown inspires art

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The closure and decommissioning of the last working Magnox nuclear reactor in the world has inspired an art exhibition.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The nuclear plant at Wylfa on Anglesey was shut down in December.
Over the two years leading up to the closure, the artist group X-10 has been creating responses to it in the form of video, photography, sound, sculpture and installation.
The exhibition, Power in the Land, has opened in Powys and will tour Wales.
Each artist has made an individual response to the physical and energetic presence of the power station, the future legacy for the Anglesey site and to the complex associations of nuclear power.
The artists were interested in looking at the site's physical, political and cultural contexts as well as surveying the actual landscape and its geographical situation.
The exhibition will be at the Oriel Davies gallery in Newtown until 6 April, before moving to Aberystwyth Arts Centre between 14 May and 2 July, and ending at Bay Arts Cardiff in January 2017.
