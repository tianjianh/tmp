Lord Dafydd Elis-Thomas, AM for Dwyfor Meirionnydd, has written to Transport Minister Edwina Hart regarding fears over the A470 Dolgellau bypass.
The letter comes days after a motorcyclist was killed and weeks after a fatal crash between a car and a refuse lorry.
On Friday, three people were injured following another crash.
It is understood the incident, which happened at the junction of the A470 and A494 just after 13:15 BST, involved people laying flowers in tribute to motorcyclist Kevin Haddock, 56, from Birmingham, who died at the weekend.
In May, John Roach, 83, of Irlam, near Manchester, died after his car collided with a refuse truck.
On Friday, the road was closed in both directions at the junction of the A470 and A494 and one woman was taken to Ysbyty Bronglais hospital, Aberystwyth.
In his letter, Lord Thomas suggested extending the 50mph speed limit and introducing roundabouts at the A494 and A493 junctions.
A Welsh government spokesperson said: "A police investigation is currently under way into the accident on the A470/A494 junction last weekend and we are working with all concerned to assist the investigation.
"We are aware of an incident earlier today and are considering whether additional measures on this stretch of road are appropriate.
"We are committed to making Wales' roads safer and continuously monitor the situation across the network, including this stretch of road."
