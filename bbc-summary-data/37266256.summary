Campaigners want the restriction on the A374 between Trerulefoot and Torpoint in Cornwall - known by bikers as the "Torpoint Twistys" - reduced from 60mph (97km) to 40mph (64km).
Eight people have been killed and 33 seriously injured since 2005.
Cornwall Council said the route had been reviewed and was "in accordance with the current national guidance".
South East Cornwall MP Sheryll Murray said she was concerned that the council had told her it did not intend to take any action.
"I'm very familiar with this road and I'm very familiar that there have been some really tragic accidents over the course of the last 15 to 20 years," she said.
Campaigner Mike Watkiss, whose friend Jennifer Lowden was killed while crossing the road with her dog in January, said he was "astounded and alarmed" that the council claimed the road was one of the safest in the county.
"It's a death trap. This is a road nick-named the 'Torpoint Twistys' and rated one of the fastest roads in Cornwall for bikers," Mr Watkiss told BBC News.
He said statistics given to him by Devon and Cornwall Police through a Freedom of Information request, showed there had been a total of 241 accidents over the past 10 years, including eight fatalities and 33 serious injuries.
