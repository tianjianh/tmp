Plea over missing 1986 Sir Antony Gormley sculpture

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An appeal has been made to find a life-sized sculpture by Sir Antony Gormley which has been missing for 30 years.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The artist created the public art as part of the National Garden Festival at Stoke-on-Trent, Historic England said.
It added the figure of a man, called A View, A Place, overlooked the Fowlea Valley but it was removed when the festival closed in 1986.
Historic England has compiled a list of works that have been lost, sold, stolen or destroyed.
The public body that protects England's historic places has appealed to people to get in touch via its website.
