A book celebrating a city's social housing was a surprise Christmas hit.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Homes and Places: A History of Nottingham's Council Houses was published to celebrate the tenth anniversary of the city's modern housing association.
The work includes pictures and planning documents dating back to the 1800s as well as memories of people who lived in the houses.
The book was a bestseller at independent bookseller Five Leaves.
As well as the personal tales of people who live in the housing, the book covers key events such as post-war rebuilding, high rise developments and Margaret Thatcher's Right to Buy scheme.
Nick Murphy, chief executive of Nottingham City Homes, said: "We wanted to produce a book to celebrate the housing achievements of the city of Nottingham to provide a social and historical look back at the city and its municipal housing."
Author Chris Williams said: "We have been very lucky to have had lots of material to work with and I'm really proud of what we have achieved. I hope Homes and Places contributes towards a better understanding of our city."
