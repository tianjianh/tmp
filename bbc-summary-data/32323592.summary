No charges for West Yorkshire police chief in bribery probe

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
West Yorkshire Police's chief constable will not face charges in connection with a bribery and misconduct investigation in Northern Ireland.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Mark Gilmore was suspended in June 2014 in connection with an investigation into the awarding of vehicle contracts.
The Public Prosecution Service said there was insufficient evidence to proceed.
West Yorkshire's Police and Crime Commissioner said his suspension was under review.
The Public Prosecution Service for Northern Ireland said: "The PPS has made a decision not to prosecute one individual in relation to the overall investigation - that is Mark Gilmore.
"There are a number of files relating to other individuals still under consideration."
The Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) had arrested a total of seven men on suspicion of offences including bribery, misconduct in public office and procuring misconduct in public office.
When he was suspended, Mr Gilmore said he had always acted with "honesty and integrity". He voluntarily attended a police station in Belfast for interview in August 2014.
Mr Gilmore, originally from Belfast, was appointed chief constable of West Yorkshire in April 2013.
He joined the Royal Ulster Constabulary, the predecessor of the PSNI, in 1983.
He has previously worked as the assistant chief constable at West Yorkshire and the deputy chief constable at Northumbria Police.
