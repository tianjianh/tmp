The woman, who reportedly gave birth out of wedlock, was convicted by a magistrate's court on Sunday.
However, the Supreme Court quashed the sentence late on Sunday, saying the ruling had violated legal procedures.
The island nation has previously issued flogging sentences to those convicted of extramarital sex.
Sunday's initial sentence had sparked outrage on social media and was criticised by rights groups.
The sentence to death by stoning was unprecedented in the country, which is known as a luxury tourist destination, the BBC's South Asia editor Charles Haviland reports.
In 2013, the case of a 15-year-old girl sentenced to 100 lashes after being found guilty of premarital sex prompted global concern. The High Court later overturned the verdict, saying she had been wrongly convicted.
Extramarital sex is illegal in the Maldives, although the ban does not apply to tourists.
