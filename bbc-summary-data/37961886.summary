Police said a fight broke out in the Spey Lounge on Leith Walk at about 01:00, then spilled out onto the pavement.
A 22-year-old man suffered serious head injuries and has been taken to Edinburgh Royal Infirmary. A woman, 22, was treated for minor injuries.
Those involved had fled by the time officers arrived, police said.
Det Con Ryan Lee said: "Police in Edinburgh are appealing for witnesses following a serious assault and large scale disturbance on Leith Walk.
"This was an extremely violent attack and we are keen to trace all parties involved as quickly as possible.
"Leith Walk is a busy part of the city and many people had been out watching the football match between England and Scotland."
He added: "We're also keen to hear from motorists who were travelling on Leith Walk and who were forced to slow down in order to pass the group safely."
