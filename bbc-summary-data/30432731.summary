Police have issued a warning after a spate of road accidents during wintery weather in Dumfries and Galloway.

Insp Neil Hewitson, of the roads policing unit, said a number of people have suffered minor injuries in the crashes on A roads in the area.
He warned motorists to prepare for their journey.
"Just because the sun is shining in Dumfries or Stranraer as you set off for Glasgow doesn't mean that it will be shining all the way up the road."
The chilly weather is expected to continue. The Met Office has issued a yellow "Be Aware" warning for snow, ice and wintry showers which will affect the region until 11:00 on Friday.
Insp Hewitson said: "The crashes have ranged from vehicles skidding off the road in icy conditions or snowbound or slushy road surfaces, through to collision between vehicles in falling snow and poor visibility.
"Drivers need to carefully consider the necessity of their journey, and prepare fully for it."
