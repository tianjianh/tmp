Republic of Ireland striker Jon Walters is optimistic he will be able to resume training on Monday, which will be a week ahead of their Euro 2016 opener.

Walters, 32, has not trained with his team-mates since Wednesday because of minor Achilles problems.
"I'm looking to go again on Monday training," Walters told FAI TV.
The Republic received a boost on Friday as James McCarthy trained with the squad after missing the warm-up games against the Netherlands and Belarus.
Everton midfielder McCarthy, 25, suffered a groin and hamstring injury in his club's final Premier League game of the season against Norwich.
Squad skipper Robbie Keane remains a doubt for the Euro 2016 opener against Sweden because of a calf injury, although he is no longer a regular starter for Martin O'Neill's side.
Stoke forward Walters underwent a minor knee operation seven weeks ago before his minor issue with both Achilles tendons flared up in midweek.
Walters was reported to have sustained a bang to his calf on Wednesday but the Republic player of the year said on Saturday that it was Achilles related.
"When you come back you have secondary little things.
"I had a little bit of tenderness on both Achilles, tendonitis. Out on the training ground it flares up a little bit, you've just got to settle it down.
"You don't want to push through it and go into next week, the week leading up to the game, pushing yourself through it.
"You have a chance to settle it down, which we did, a couple of days and that's what I've done."
After a weekend off, the Republic players will resume training on Monday before their departure to France on Wednesday.
Martin O'Neill's side face the Swedes in their Group E opener in Paris on 13 June before further games against Belgium and Italy.
