[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A 72-year-old man found guilty of historical sex abuse against two young girls has been jailed for 12 months.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Ralston Graham's victims included a girl aged just four years old.
The Langholm man was also placed on the sex offenders' register after a six-day trial at Dumfries Sheriff Court.
Sheriff George Jamieson told him: "There is no punishment I can impose which fully reflects the horror experienced by the victims of your offending. "
He added: "I cannot restore the lost innocence of their childhood."
A jury found Graham had twice used lewd and indecent behaviour towards a girl in Langholm between 1976 and 1979, when she was aged between nine and 12.
He committed a similar offence between 1988 and 1990 against a girl aged between four and seven.
During the trial, the court heard evidence from his victims.
Sentencing, Sheriff Jamieson said Graham took advantage of his position as a family friend to abuse one girl in her bedroom.
"Even after all these years she recollected these events in a manner which spoke of the extreme sense of fear, hurt and distress she experienced as a result of your conduct towards her."
He added: "The effect of your conduct on both victims has been profound and has extended into their adulthood."
The court heard that Graham, who has been married for 55 years, was his wife's primary carer.
He was found not guilty of two further charges of indecent behaviour in the 1970s and 1990s.
