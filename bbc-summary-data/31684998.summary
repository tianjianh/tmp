Massimiliano Allegri's side keep their nine-point cushion over Roma in second and may feel it should be more, having faced 10 men for nearly half an hour.
Vasilios Torosidis picked up a second yellow card and Carlos Tevez stylishly whipped in the resulting free-kick.
Seydou Keita headed level but Juve are closing in on a fourth straight title.
Roma, last champions in 2001, simply struggled to ask questions of a Juve side without key midfielders Andrea Pirlo and Paul Pogba in the Italian capital.
The players delayed kick-off by 15 minutes in a show of solidarity towards cash-strapped Parma, who are on the brink of collapse, but when this much anticipated fixture started, neither side registered a shot on target in the opening 45 minutes.
This was Roma's big chance to cut the gap to six points by inflicting just a second defeat of the season on Juve, but they were ponderous, passing sideways as the visitors sat deep.
Juve recorded a record 102 points to win last season's title and though this year has not proven quite the same demolition job, their experience defensively was telling on the big occasion.
Neither side attacked with intent and both delivered well-timed fouls at the sense of danger, yielding nine bookings in all and one red card.
Torosidis caught Arturo Vidal in the opening period and tripped the Chilean just over 20 yards from goal to earn his dismissal.
He had barely left the pitch when Tevez bent a free-kick over the wall right footed and past Morgan De Sanctis in the Roma goal.
It was a goal worthy of winning such a crucial match but Roma responded admirably and Keita leapt at the back post to guide a header home despite Alvaro Morata's attempted clearance on the line.
His second goal of the season would not prove enough to force an unlikely win and with 39 points left to play for, Roma must hope others in Serie A can damage Juventus's fine form.
Roma manager Rudi Garcia: "What I can say is that we responded magnificently. Considering that we were a man and a goal down, to end the game playing the way we did shows you that we're alive and kicking. We showed immense character."
Juventus manager Massimiliano Allegri: "Drawing this game angers us. We haven't won on the road for three games and it's now time to get back to doing so. "Considering how the game was panning out and the way we played it's a pity to leave here with a point, but in the final stages of the game, with Roma's pressure, we could have even risked losing."
