Dublin: Luas faces 10th day of shutdown in pay dispute

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The public tram system in the Irish capital is facing a 10th day of shutdown as part of the long-running dispute over drivers' pay.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Strike action will force up to 90,000 potential passengers on Dublin's Luas to make alternative travel plans.
Four more strikes are planned for later this month and there is no sign of an end to the dispute.
Luas operator Transdev said it has been fined almost 1m euros (Â£790,250) for not providing services on strike days.
But the company added that when the non-payment of wages and the 6.5% bonus are offset, it has lost about 400,000 euros (Â£316,000).
Transdev's chief executive Gerry Madden said the company and the drivers were still too far apart to begin talks, with the drivers seeking an increase of about 23% and the company offering about 13%.
One source on the drivers' side of the row has said there is a possibility of up to four 48-hour stoppages in June.
But they have stopped short of delivering on their threat to ballot for an all-out indefinite strike.
