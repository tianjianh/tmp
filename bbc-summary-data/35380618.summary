Eddie Girvan killing: Woman charged with Greenisland murder

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A 29-year-old woman has appeared in court charged with the murder of Greenisland pensioner Eddie Girvan.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Margaret Henderson, whose address was given as Verner Street in Belfast, was remanded in custody.
Mr Girvan, 67, was found dead in his home on Station Road by police on Monday night. His hands were tied and he had a stab wound to his chest.
A defence barrister said the accused was an "extremely vulnerable lady" with "complex needs".
He told Belfast Magistrates Court that she was "fragile" and "susceptible to others" and would require immediate care in custody.
She replied "aye" when asked if she understood the charge.
Two men arrested in connection with Mr Girvan's murder were released unconditionally on Thursday.
