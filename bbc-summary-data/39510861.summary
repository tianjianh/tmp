Omar Bogle, Will Grigg, Andy Kellett, Donervon Daniels and Ryan Tunnicliffe are all still out.
Barnsley's Adam Hammill (toe), Andy Yiadom (shoulder), Aidy White (pelvis) and Sessi D'Almeida (knee) are out.
Paul Heckingbottom's side are looking for back to back wins for the first time since January.
BBC Radio Manchester's Paul Rowley
"Frankly, every game now is a 'must win' for the 'Tics if they're to avoid their third relegation in five seasons.
"Saturday's stoppage-time victory over already doomed Rotherham United after twice going behind revived memories of the club's great survivals in their Premier League days.
"But, with most of their rivals winning, Graham Barrow's side are still seven points from safety with five matches left.
"Victory over Barnsley, promoted with Wigan from League One last season, will narrow the gap, but with away matches upcoming at promotion-chasing Brighton and Reading, the task may be too great."
