[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A former Southampton footballer who ran and cycled to every Premier League and Championship stadium in two weeks is set to receive the freedom of the city.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Francis Benali, who made more than 300 appearances for Southampton FC, ran a marathon and cycled 75 miles (120km) each day for a fortnight.
Southampton City Council is to vote on a motion giving him honorary freedom of the city.
The 47-year-old said he was "shocked and surprised" by the honour.
The 1,000-mile (1,600 km) route linking 44 football clubs took him into south Wales, the Midlands and the North-West, before crossing the country and returning via East Anglia and London.
He raised more than Â£390,000 for Cancer Research.
Mr Benali received a standing ovation from fans when he arrived at St Mary's Stadium at half time during a home match against Burnley on 16 October.
It followed a 2015 challenge which saw him running between Premier League stadiums.
A motion before a Southampton City Council meeting on 16 November proposes bestowing the honorary freedom of the city on Francis Benali "in recognition of his fundraising achievements for charitable causes".
Mr Benali said: "I'm very humbled and honoured to be recognised. It was completely unexpected and I'm very grateful."
Other individuals to have been given the honour include former Saints managers Ted Bates and Lawrie McMenemy, former player Matthew Le Tissier, and World War One prime minister David Lloyd George.
