[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Dr Helen Nicoll, 53, was found at her house in Great Wilbraham at about 06:30 BST on Friday.
She lived at the property with her husband, Stephen Nicoll, 53, also a dentist, with a practice in Harley Street.
A 53-year-old man from south Cambridgeshire, arrested on suspicion of murder, was released on bail.
The Nicolls were described by neighbours as a "loving but private" couple.
A police spokesman said: "The 53-year-old man from South Cambridgeshire was arrested after police were called to a sudden death in Frog End.
"A cordon was put in place and the death of the woman, who is in her 50s, was treated as suspicious."
A post-mortem examination is expected to take place later when officers will continue to question the arrested man.
