[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Anthony Ferrie was being taken back to jail in a G4S vehicle following a visit to Livingston's St John's Hospital.
One officer was knocked unconscious and another suffered an arm injury during the escape at about 14:15.
A spokeswoman for the Scottish Prison Service said: "We are aware that an individual has escaped from the custody of G4S while on a hospital escort."
She added: "We are assisting Police Scotland to apprehend them."
Willie Galloway, head of operations for G4S's custody transport in Scotland, said: "Two members of our crew were injured during the incident which left one unconscious and the other with an injury to their arm.
"While they both remain in hospital, their injuries do not at this stage appear to be life-threatening and we are supporting them and their families.
"We are assisting Police Scotland's inquiry to recapture this prisoner and are working with the Scottish Prison Service to understand the events leading up to this escape."
Ferrie, 33, was being held at Addiewell Prison in West Lothian.
He is described as white, 6ft tall and of slim build. He was wearing a blue sweater, jeans and trainers.
Ferrie, who police said should not be approached by members of the public, is believed to have links to Bellshill, Motherwell and Grangemouth.
