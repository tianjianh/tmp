The keeper had little to do until he kept out Christian Doidge's looping header and then tipped Matt Richards' goal-bound free-kick onto the woodwork.
Earlier, the Magpies started well but Jon Stead was denied by a combination of Daggers goalkeeper Liam O'Brien and Joe Worrall after Jason Banton's cross.
The hosts' Adam Campbell also had an early shout for a penalty waved away.
Dagenham & Redbridge manager John Still told BBC Radio London:
"That was as good a performance as I think I've seen from a team I've had this season.
"I've seen us gradually improving. We haven't always been able to get up a head of steam, whereas today we were more controlled with the ball and had more purpose about our attacks.
"I was really, really pleased. I can't ask more from the players with a performance like that."
