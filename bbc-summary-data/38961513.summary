[SN]TITLE[SN]
Man jailed for sexually abusing girls in Blackpool

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man who admitted sexually abusing two teenage girls has been jailed.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Nigel Lloyd abused the girls, then aged 15, between 2001 and 2003 in Blackpool, Lancashire.
Lloyd, of no fixed address, admitted indecent assault and gross indecency and was jailed for five years and four months at Preston Crown Court.
The 51-year-old was arrested by police investigating the murder of 14-year-old Charlene Downes. There is no direct link between the cases.
Detectives have been looking at links between Charlene's case and the "wider issue of child sexual exploitation" in Blackpool.
The schoolgirl was last seen in the seaside resort in 2003. Her body has never been found.
