Jersey Fire and Rescue's inshore rescue boat was called out on Monday afternoon after reports of a woman trapped near to the lighthouse.
The woman was taken from the rocks unharmed and back to St Helier in an RNLI lifeboat.
It is understood she had been taking photographs and had not noticed the tide surrounding her.
La Corbiere is on the south western corner of Jersey and is popular with tourists, although the area is known to be rocky with a strong swell. The fire service said the incident highlighted the need for visitors to be aware of the tide times.
