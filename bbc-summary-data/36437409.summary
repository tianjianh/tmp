The 25-year-old can play in defence or midfield and made 15 appearances last season while on loan at Rodney Parade.
"It's good to be back," Bennett said. "I really enjoyed my time here and I'm delighted to sign here permanently."
"The fans loved him during his time here and I'm sure Scot will be a great addition to the squad," County manager Warren Feeney said.
Bennett, who played 141 times for Exeter City, was signed on loan last season from Notts County by then Newport boss John Sheridan.
Sheridan has since been appointed Notts County manager, but Bennett was released by the Magpies this week.
Following the signings of Jamie Turley and Mark Randall, Bennett becomes Newport's third signing of the summer.
They have also retained a player from last season, with Darren Jones signing a new one-year contract extension.
The club also allowed 13 players to depart after they finished one place outside the League Two relegation zone.
