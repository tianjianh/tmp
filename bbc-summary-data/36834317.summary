The day ticket costing £10 for adults, £7 for children and £25 for a family is aimed at providing affordable public transport on the TrawsCymru network.
Economy Secretary Ken Skates hailed it as "an exciting opportunity" to boost use of the government-funded service.
TrawsCymru buses carried more than two million passengers last year.
"The new TrawsCymru Day Ticket is an exciting opportunity to encourage people across Wales to enjoy this fantastic public transport service and travel Wales," said Mr Skates.
"The ticket represents a significant saving for those looking to make long distance journeys and, hopefully, facilitate more hop-on hop-off travel across Wales too - boosting tourism and local economies in the process."
The scheme allows unlimited travel on T1, T2, T3, T4, T5, T9 services and on the X85 service between Newtown and Machynlleth.
