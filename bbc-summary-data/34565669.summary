Martin O'Neill's side play the first leg away on 13 November, with the return tie three days later.
The Republic could have secured automatic qualification from Group D with a 2-2 draw in Poland earlier this month but lost 2-1.
In the three other play-off matches, Ukraine play Slovenia, Sweden face Denmark, while Norway take on Hungary.
Bosnia finished third in Group B behind Belgium and Wales, drawing 0-0 against Chris Coleman's side in Cardiff before winning 2-0 at home.
"If there's any slight advantage to be had, it's maybe that the second game will be in Dublin," O'Neill said.
"We will go for it and give it everything we've got. We had terrific results against Germany - the draw out in Germany and a home win - and because that's so recent we can draw real confidence from it."
The Republic's only previous meeting with Bosnia is a 1-0 friendly win in 2012, when Shane Long scored the decisive goal.
They reached Euro 2012 via the play-offs, with the side then managed by Giovanni Trapattoni beating Estonia 5-1 over two legs.
But in November 2009 they were beaten in a play-off to reach the 2010 World Cup by France, who went through with a goal which should have been disallowed for a Thierry Henry handball.
