[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Patrick Maloney, 43, died after he was hit by a vehicle at Toddbury Farm, near Leighton Buzzard, on 2 August.
Thomas McCarthy, 24, who lives at the same site, will now face a charge of assault, prosecutors told Luton Crown Court.
His brother, Christopher McCarthy, 21, has been charged with Mr Maloney's murder and was remanded in custody.
They are both due to return to Luton Crown Court on 16 September.
A 42-year-old woman who was arrested has been bailed.
A post-mortem examination found Mr Maloney died as a result of "multiple crushing injuries consistent with being involved in a collision with a vehicle".
