Woman and dogs hurt in Hareshaw Linn waterfall plunge

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A woman and her two dogs were seriously injured when they fell 20ft (6m) from a waterfall in Northumberland National Park.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The woman slipped at the top of Harseshaw Linn Waterfall near Bellingham, shortly after noon on Saturday.
Several rescue teams came to her aid and she was airlifted to the Royal Victoria Infirmary in Newcastle, while the dogs were taken to a vet.
The rescue took three hours 20 minutes.
A spokesman for the Northumberland National Park Mountain Rescue Team said the waterfall is at the bottom of a steep wooded ravine.
The North of Tyne Mountain Rescue Team and North East Ambulance Service helped them winch the woman, who is in her early 40s, on a stretcher out of the waterfall before carrying her through the ravine to fields, where the Great North Air Ambulance was waiting to take her to hospital.
