[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Suzanne Hughes was last seen at about 22:30 BST on the 17 July in Cromer, Norfolk, where she was holidaying with her husband, daughter and grandson.
Her husband Alan claimed it was "out of character" for the 67-year-old, from Solihull, to go missing.
He said he woke at about midnight to discover his wife was not in the house and the front door was open.
Coastguards and a police helicopter have been involved in the search for Mrs Hughes, and Norfolk police said "a large amount" of CCTV footage has been examined.
