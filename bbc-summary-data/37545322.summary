Slabs of concrete in the garden of the Forth Valley Sensory Centre in Camelon were broken up and walls were spray painted over the weekend.
The vandalism happened between 17:00 on Friday and 09:00 on Monday.
PC Arthur McInnes said: "This garden gives people with sensory impairment a place to relax that is tailored for their needs."
He added: "These vandals have shown no regard for the cost to the charity or the needs of the people who use it."
A fountain was also damaged and defaced with graffiti.
A spokesman for the centre said: "We were saddened to discover the damage on Monday morning after a very positive week.
"The garden is a place where everyone, not just centre users, can come and have a sit down, a conversation or a moment of quiet and it has been one of the key features of the sensory centre since it was built.
"This is a mindless act of vandalism which means that the garden is currently closed while we clean up and make things safe again. It is just disappointing that something which is here for the benefit of the community would be targeted in this way."
Anyone with information should contact police.
