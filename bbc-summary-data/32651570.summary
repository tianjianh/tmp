Officials welcomed them at the airport where they flew in from Egypt's capital, Cairo.
Ethiopia said their rescue was made possible "through co-ordinated effort" with the Egyptian government, but it is unclear who was holding them.
More than 20 Ethiopians were killed in April by the Libyan branch of Islamic State, which filmed the executions.

On Thursday, Egypt's President Abdul Fatah al-Sisi said that Egyptian forces had rescued the Ethiopians from Libya.
But one of those who had been rescued had a different version of events, the Reuters news agency reports.
He said they had been held by the Libyan immigration authorities.
In April, Ethiopia observed three days of mourning for the more than 20 Ethiopians killed by Islamic State in Libya.
A video showing some of the victims being beheaded and others being shot shocked many people.
