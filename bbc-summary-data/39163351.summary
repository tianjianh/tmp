[SN]TITLE[SN]
Exeter City 0-2 Accrington Stanley

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Accrington put a dent in the League Two promotion hopes of Exeter with a richly-deserved win.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The visitors almost went in front in the ninth minute but Shay McCartan was denied by a brilliant one-handed stop from Bobby Olejnik.
However, Olejnik was beaten three minutes later when McCartan fired home a brilliant free-kick.
Exeter were disappointing in the first half - David Wheeler missing their best chance with a downward header which was tipped over the bar.
In the second half McCartan was foiled again by another smart stop from Olejnik, but from the resulting corner Matty Pearson headed into an empty net as the goalkeeper went walkabouts.
Ollie Watkins fired a free-kick wide and Joel Grant also failed to hit the target as Exeter tried to find a way back into the contest, but Accrington held firm to claim a well-deserved win.
