The comedian came ahead of Johnny Depp and Ben Stiller, who complete the top three, to pick up the honour.
The rankings were decided by the magazine after comparing actors' estimated pay with the budget and revenue of the last three films they starred in before June 2014.
Animated films and cameos were not included in the list.
Although Sandler's latest film Grown Ups 2 took $246m (£158.4m) at the global box office, it didn't make up for the more disappointing takings of 48-year-old's previous releases, Jack and Jill and That's My Boy.
It's estimated that for every $1 (64p) Sandler was paid, he returned an average of $3.20 (£2).
By comparison, Emma Stone - who topped Forbes' 2013 best actors for the buck list - returned an estimated $80.70 (£51.94) for every $1 she was paid for her last three movies.
Pirates of the Caribbean star Johnny Depp is second on the 2014 overpaid list, returning an average of $4.10 (£2.64) for each dollar he was paid.
The 51-year-old's average was lowered by recent films The Lone Ranger and Dark Shadows.
Comedian Ben Stiller, whose film Night at the Museum: Secrets of the Tomb was released in the UK earlier this month, is number three on the list.
His estimated return of $4.80 (£3.09) owes itself to Tower Heist and The Watch not performing too well at the box office.
The top five is completed by Ryan Reynolds, with a return of $4.90 (£3.15) for each dollar paid, and Oscar winner Tom Hanks, who pulled in a $5.20 (£3.35) return.
According to Forbes, Cloud Atlas - which sees Hanks taking on six roles - was an expensive flop for the actor.
Will Ferrell ($6.60, £4.25), Channing Tatum ($6.70, £4.31), Denzel Washington ($6.90, £4.44) and Ben Affleck ($9.37, £6.03) also appear in the top 10.
Sandra Bullock is the only actress to appear on the list, coming in ninth with a return of ($9, $5.37).
