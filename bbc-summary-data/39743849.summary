The 28-year-old has scored 24 goals in 103 league appearances for the Cobblers and helped them win the League Two title last season.
O'Toole will not play for the side until next season after having surgery on a groin problem earlier this week.
"John-Joe won us some big matches this season with some very important goals," said manager Justin Edinburgh.
"We knew there would be a lot of interest in him so we were very keen to get John-Joe's future secured early and we are delighted to have done just that."
