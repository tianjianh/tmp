Eight of the GB boxing team reached Friday's semi-finals in Ukraine, guaranteeing medals in the process.
Galal Yafai (49kg), Peter McGrail (56kg), Luke McCormack (64kg) and Cheavon Clarke (91kg) won through.
Niall Farrell (52kg), Pat McCormack (69kg), Calum French (60kg) and Frazer Clarke (+91kg) won later on Wednesday.
The GB Boxing team have got a new Olympic cycle of athletes with the majority of the Rio 2016 fighters now professional or set to turn pro.
Only Yafai and McCormack have experience at an international tournament yet the squad still outperformed the six-medal haul achieved at the 2015 European Championships.
"This young team are developing well considering the Tokyo Olympics are just over three years away," said Team GB performance director Rob McCracken, who is Anthony Joshua's coach.
"The challenge for the boxers and the team is to try to turn those medals into a silver or a gold. It has been a tremendous showing out here and bodes well for the future."
All 10 of the squad qualified for the World Championships in Hamburg, Germany, in August, courtesy of reaching the quarter-finals in Kharkiv.
Only Lee McGregor (56kg) and Tom Whittaker-Hart (81kg) of the British squad failed to reach the semi-finals.
Scotland's Sean Lazzerini (81kg) and Aqeel Ahmed (49kg) were beaten in the last eight but consequently secured places at August's Worlds.
Clarke at heavyweight was impressive as he knocked out Abdulkadir Abdullayev of Azerbaijan in round one of their quarter-final.
Yafai, McGrail, Pat McCormack and Farrell all claimed every round in their wins. Victories for both McCormack twins and French ensures Gateshead's Birtley ABC Gym has three fighters still in the competition.
Those through to the semi-finals will compete on Friday, live on the BBC Red Button, with finals taking place on Sunday.
