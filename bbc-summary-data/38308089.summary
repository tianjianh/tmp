The preferred route for a £113m new Tay crossing and link road around Perth has been approved by councillors.

The Cross Tay Link Road would cross the River Tay from west of the A9 and link with the A93 and A94 north of Scone.
A report prepared for Perth and Kinross Council said it would pave the way for thousands of new jobs and relieve traffic congestion.
The route has two-thirds of its funding in place, with the £35m shortfall part of a bid to the Tay Cities Deal.
Council depute chief executive Jim Valentine's report to the local authority highlighted "increasing concern" about traffic congestion and air quality issues in and around Perth over the past 20 years.
The report said that every £1 of capital invested in the Cross Tay Link Road would generate an estimated £4.30 of revenue.
They said it could lead to £966m of private sector investment via new housing and employment.
It added: "While a relatively simple low level crossing of the river will be the cost effective solution, more iconic structural designs have been considered."
The council estimates the new route will be open to general traffic by 2022.
