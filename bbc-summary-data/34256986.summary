New French central bank head 'risks conflicts of interest'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Nearly 150 French economists have protested against the appointment of a former BNP Paribas banker to head France's central bank.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The economists, mostly academics, wrote in Le Monde newspaper that Francois Villeroy de Galhau's background posed a conflict of interest.
Mr Villeroy de Galhau has assured the government that that would not be the case.
Current bank governor Christian Noyer retires at the end of next month.
Mr Villeroy de Galhau's appointment is still subject to government approval.
The economists, which included inequality expert Thomas Piketty and ex-World Bank chief economist Francois Bourguignon, called on politicians to reject his nomination in confirmation hearings before the finance committees of both houses of parliament on 29 September.
"It's a total illusion to say that one can serve the banking industry and several months later assume its regulation with impartiality and total independence," they said.
As head of the Bank of France he will also sit on the European Central Bank's rate-setting council.
