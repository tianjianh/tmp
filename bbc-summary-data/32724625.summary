Sussex Twenty20 captain Luke Wright is happy for the side to take risks in the T20 Blast as the Hove side look to rediscover their one-day form.

The 2009 champions have failed to progress from the group stage in the past two years.
"I really want people to play with freedom and have a good go at it," the 30-year-old told BBC Sussex.
"I'd rather us take risks than go any other way and that is the message I am trying to give to all the batters."
He added: "I know people will make mistakes, as I have in my career, but you have just got to accept it."
Quarter-finalists in 2010 and 2011 and then semi-finalists in 2012, Wright is aware Sussex have underperformed in T20 competition in the last two seasons.
"For the last couple of years we have started really badly and then ended up finishing quite strong," the batsman said.
"We are lucky with the crowds. Even when we have been struggling, people keep turning out and supporting us.
"We want to be in quarter-finals and at finals day and we are looking to put that right. We all know we need to play better to do that."
Wright, who has played 51 T20 internationals for England, replaced Ed Joyce as captain in February.
"It's a hugely proud moment," he said.
"Even in the warm-up games in Abu Dhabi and Dubai it was great to do.
"You feel wins and losses even more when you're captain but everyone seems in good places and it's just trying to pick the side.
"There are a few headaches for selection, which is what I want."
Sussex, who have signed former Sri Lanka captain Mahela Jayawardene for their first seven T20 Blast matches, begin their campaign away to Kent on Friday (19:00 BST).
