[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Scott Borthwick led Durham's resistance with 53 as title hopefuls Yorkshire kept the pressure on the visitors on day two at Headingley.

The home side added 119 to their overnight 341-5 before being bowled out for 460, as Barry McCarthy took 3-103.
Mark Stoneman (38) and Keaton Jennings (40) gave Durham a solid start in reply and Borthwick reached 50 off 93 balls.
But none of them could play a major innings and the visitors were 205-4 at stumps, still 255 behind.
Yorkshire had to settle for four bonus points in the morning session after Graham Onions bowled a maiden to Steven Patterson with eight runs needed for the fifth.
But Azeem Rafiq (45) and Jack Brooks (36) made useful runs to boost the total before Paul Collingwood bowled Brooks to end the innings.
Stoneman was first to go when Durham batted, edging a catch to slip off Brooks, and Patterson ended in-form Jennings' hopes of another big score by having him caught behind.
Both Jennings and Jack Burnham were dropped by Jake Lehmann and the latter survived to the close on 34 not out, but Tim Bresnan claimed a vital wicket by bowling former England team-mate Collingwood off the inside edge for six.
