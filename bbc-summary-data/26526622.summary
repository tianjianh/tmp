The two parties have reached a mutually satisfactory agreement and the legal case has been dropped, according to a statement given to Screen Daily.
They producers had claimed her last-minute departure caused delays on the Natalie Portman-starring Western.
The Scottish film-maker had previously denied reports she was being sued.
Ramsay's last film, an adaptation of the novel We Need to Talk About Kevin, starring Tilda Swinton, premiered to critical acclaim in competition in Cannes in 2011.
The film also earned her a Bafta nomination and the best director prize at the British Independent Film Awards.
Jane Got a Gun will tell the story of a woman who asks an ex-lover for help in saving her husband from a gang who want him dead.
Jude Law and Bradley Cooper also left the production shortly after Ramsay. The film will now be directed by Gavin O'Connor, with a cast including Ewan McGregor and Joel Edgerton.
"Jane Got a Gun Production LLC and Lynne Ramsay announce the pending civil action and all other disputes between the parties associated with Jane Got a Gun Motion Picture have been resolved privately and to their mutual satisfaction," said the statement published by Screen Daily.
It was not revealed whether the resolution involved a financial settlement. Ramsay herself has yet to comment.
Several sources claimed the disagreements involved delays and control of the film's final cut, with the Hollywood Reporter claiming Ramsay had not been presented with an approved schedule, script or budget days before shooting was set to begin.
In November, the Hollywood Reporter also published court papers, in which it was claimed Ramsay "was repeatedly under the influence of alcohol, was abusive to members of the cast and crew and was generally disruptive".
Ramsay later issued a statement saying she had not been served with that particular lawsuit.
"The allegations as recently reported are simply false," the statement added. "Lynne looks forward to presenting the truth about this situation in the proper forum."
