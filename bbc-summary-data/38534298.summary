He is also charged with two counts of inciting a boy under the age of 14 to commit acts of gross indecency.

He returned in the role of district Scout active support member at Butchers Coppice Camp site in 2010, the force said.
Det Con Jonathan McKinney, of Dorset Police's Child Abuse Investigation Team, said: "Following our investigation into the allegations, the Crown Prosecution Service directed Dorset Police to charge Paul Cherrett with these offences.
"Throughout this investigation the Scout Association has been fully informed and has been working with Dorset Police."
