The Swiss-Indian duo, who were also victorious at Wimbledon, beat Yaroslava Shvedova and Casey Dellacqua 6-3 6-3.
"It has been a great year for us," Mirza said. "To back up [Wimbledon], we feel like we're a really solid team."
Hingis, 34, also won the US Open mixed doubles title alongside Leander Paes, and has now claimed five Major doubles titles in total in 2015.
"From the start, we hit it off," she said of her partnership with Mirza. "Our games work well together."
Hingis - a former world number one singles player who came out of retirement for a second time in 2013 - has now won a total of 14 Grand Slam doubles titles in her career, while 28-year-old Mirza has five.
