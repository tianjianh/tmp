Footage of a new beaver kit in the Knapdale Forest in Argyll has been released by the Scottish Beaver Trial (SBT).

It is the first young beaver to be spotted at the trial site this year.
SBT said it suspects further breeding has occurred but is yet to be captured on camera.
The trial is the first licensed reintroduction of a mammal to the UK and has brought the beaver back to Scotland after a 400-year absence.
Roisin Campbell-Palmer of SBT said: "This footage shows a recently emerged kit, in good body condition, investigating the top of the lodge where it lives.
"It is fantastic news that evidence of continued breeding at the trial site is occurring.
"Though the monitoring period has officially ended, our education ranger is still in place carrying out guided walks, delivering the education programme and keeping an eye on beaver activity."
She added: "During the spring and summer, beavers are more active while it is still light so there is a greater chance for people to see them in the wild. Our guided walks are still running, where you can learn all about these fascinating animals."
The five-year trial, which was led by the Scottish Wildlife Trust and the Royal Zoological Society of Scotland, started in May 2009, when the beavers first arrived in Knapdale from Norway.
It ended in the spring of this year, with a report setting out options for the future of beavers in Scotland currently being considered by the environment minister, who is expected to make a decision later in the year.
