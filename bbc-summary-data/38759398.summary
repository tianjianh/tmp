The 31-year-old spent the first part of the season at MLS side Portland Timbers, having left Newcastle in the summer after 268 appearances.
"He's hungry to get back in and prove to everybody that he can still play, at least at this level," Ipswich boss Mick McCarthy told BBC Radio Suffolk.
McCarthy also said Leon Best will not feature for his team again this season.
Former Rotherham and Coventry forward Best, 30, has played 12 times for Ipswich since joining on a one-year deal in August, but failed to score.
