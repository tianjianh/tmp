Boxing heroes from the past and the present attended the event.
The statue is a tribute to former boxers, but also an encouragement to future generations to take up the sport.
Among those attending its unveiling was former British bantamweight champion Davy Larmour and current featherweight Marco McCullough.
"I travelled far and wide, I travelled the world," Mr Larmour said.
"Been in Cuba, America, Romania, Russia - I won titles in different places all over the world."
Marco McCullough said he used to hear stories about Larmour when he was a child.
"Wayne McCullough, Larmour, we've always had good boxers coming through, so it's brilliant," he said.
"You used to have the likes of Larmour coming in and out of the clubs and you used to hear stories.
"Then when you got older you started watching videos of him and started looking up to him."
