The 18-year-old made his first-team debut for Leeds in their FA Cup fourth-round defeat by Sutton United last season.
"I'm here to play games, score goals and fight for promotion," said Wilks.
"I've been at Leeds since I was 15, this is my first loan spell and I'm excited to get going and make that step up to senior league football."
Wilks has also extended his Leeds contract by one year, keeping him at Elland Road until the end of the 2018-19 season.
