[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A babysitter caused fatal injuries to a seven-month-old girl by shaking her "repeatedly, vigorously and aggressively", a court has heard.

Chuanfang Zheng, 31, was looking after Phoebe Guo at a home in Lutterworth, Leicestershire on 22 March 2015.
Phoebe suffered a "catastrophic injury" caused by "excessive force", jurors at Leicester Crown Court were told.
Ms Zheng, of Mortlock Close, Southwark, London, denies one charge of manslaughter.
The court heard Phoebe was "in good health and acting normally" when she was left with Ms Zheng.
Within half an hour, prosecutors said, the baby had suffered "significant bleeding" on the brain and behind the eye and had lapsed into unconsciousness.
With the baby in her arms, Ms Zheng ran to a Chinese takeaway next door, on Linden Drive, where the baby's parents worked.
Phoebe was then rushed by car to hospital.
There were '"extensive" medical efforts to save her, but the baby died four days later from her severe injuries having never regained consciousness, the court heard.
Adrian Langdale, prosecuting, said it would never be possible to establish exactly what happened behind closed doors that evening.
"Chuanfang Zheng must have caused significant abusive head trauma described historically as 'shaken baby' and described by an expert as being 'very much at the severe end of the range'," he said.
"It would have been immediately apparent to Chuanfang Zheng what she had done."
The jury was told Ms Zheng made a concerted effort to lie about the events leading up to the incident and had tried to cover up her actions.
Ms Zheng tried to blame the mother's efforts to resuscitate the baby for causing the serious injuries.
The trial, listed for three weeks, continues.
