The Quarry centre pool in Shrewsbury, which dates back to 1864, could shut as Shropshire Council considers seven options for the future.
Campaigners said it would be less convenient if a new pool was built away from the town centre.
The council, which will announce its preferred option on 13 July, said the existing pool was "very inefficient".
The Quarry Swimming and Fitness Forum, representing people who use the Quarry centre, organised the march through the town.
It ended with a rally by the pool site.
Group member Alison McKittrick said: "Shrewsbury has a river going through it, so there are only two road bridges to get from one side of the town to the other.
"Transport is a key issue so by keeping the pool in the town centre it's most accessible to everybody."
The council's cabinet member for leisure and culture, Stuart West, said the pool was "very tired".
He said: "The running costs are high because of the need for constant repairs.
"It really needs to either be replaced or refurbished to make it more viable and more cost effective to run."
A survey of 2,000 people as part of a five-month consultation revealed 68% wanted a pool at the existing site.
Mr West said: "We've given an option to interested parties, interested organisations, to come forward with a business case that will enable us to keep it here.
"We've given them up to 12 months to actually formulate that business case, which I think is a fair time."
