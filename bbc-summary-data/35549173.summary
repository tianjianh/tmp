Last year's Price of Football study analysed more than 700 tickets, with 70% seeing a price freeze or reduction.
As it stands, eight of the 20 Premier League clubs have already released their season ticket prices for the 2016-17 campaign.
West Ham have brought down their prices, as they prepare to move to the Olympic Stadium in the summer.
Arsenal, Manchester United, Newcastle, Norwich and Swansea have all frozen their prices, and Liverpool have now decided to do the same after scrapping their controversial plans to raise the top-price tickets.
The majority of Crystal Palace's season ticket prices will stay the same, although there will be an increase in one section of the ground.
When contacted by BBC Sport, 11 clubs said their price ranges have not yet been decided and will be released later in the year.
