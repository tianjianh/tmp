Several players are suffering from the illness, according to a statement on the National Rugby League website.
However, the afflicted players are expected to have fully recovered in time for Saturday's final against New Zealand in Wellington.
"I think there are about four or five blokes [affected] this morning," team member Greg Bird told Sky Sports Radio.
Bird said back-rower Beau Scott probably would not play this weekend because of a hamstring injury he suffered playing against England earlier this month.
Bird said the Kangaroos needed to play "smarter" if they were to beat their Kiwi rivals.
"It was a little erratic in game one. The combinations have been thought out a little bit better now and hopefully we can get a win."
The Kangaroos easily beat Samoa last weekend in Wollongong, with the island team providing little resistance to the Kangaroos' attacking play.
