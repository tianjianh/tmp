Thousands of swimmers have raced down London's Serpentine in a mass open water event.

More than 4,500 people took part in the mile-long (1.6km) event as part of the open water festival in Hyde Park.
With the swimmers starting in 18 separate waves Guy Davis and Lara Langston, were the first man and woman to cross the finish line.
Ms Langston said: "It was a great swim. I didn't realise it was the first year so it's quite nice to be part of it."
Organised by London Marathon Events, places were distributed by ballot after the first 16,000 applications were received.
Hugh Brasher, the event director, said: "Our aim is to grow it into the largest open water swimming event in the UK."
On Sunday the festival turns more serious when it hosts the invitational British Open Water Swimming Championships where swimmers will compete over a 3.1 mile (5km) course.
