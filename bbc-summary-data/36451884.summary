[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Keziah Flux-Edmonds died in hospital after she was found unconscious near her father's body at a house on the Isle of Wight on Wednesday.
A post-mortem examination showed her father Darren Flux-Edmonds hanged himself.
On Monday, PCSOs and psychologists will visit Queensgate Foundation Primary School to reassure the children.
There will also be the chance for parents dropping off their children to talk to police, school staff and the local vicar Reverend Allie Kerr.
The post-mortem examination on Keziah's body was undetermined and further tests are being carried out.
Police said her father's death was not being treated as suspicious and they are not looking for anyone else.
Insp Sam Dunlop said: "We know that the events in East Cowes this week have had a massive impact on the community and our thoughts are with Keziah's mum and the families involved."
