Snow gates are to be fitted on parts of an exposed road between South Yorkshire and Greater Manchester in a bid to stop drivers using the route in bad weather.

The gates will be installed on the A628 Woodhead Pass at Flouch roundabout near Penistone and east of the junction with the A6024 near Woodhead Reservoir.
Electronic signs to warn drivers the road ahead is closed will also be fitted, the Highways Agency said.
Work begins on the gates this week and is expected to be completed by April.
Costing Â£250,000, the gates and signs will be operated manually by the police in conjunction with the Highways Agency.
The warning signs will be sited on the east and westbound approaches to the A628 at Mottram roundabout in Greater Manchester and at the Flouch and Westwood roundabouts in South Yorkshire.
Sujad Hussain, Highways Agency project manager, said the aim of the gates and signs was not to close the Woodhead Pass more frequently.
"Weather conditions and driver safety will continue to dictate when, or if, this happens," he said.
"What we are trying to do is ensure that drivers already on the route have more warning of what's ahead and have more time to take alternative strategic routes."
Anthony Ashton, South Yorkshire Police's traffic management officer, said the gates would free police resources during bad weather as officers would no longer have to be present at points where the Woodhead Pass was closed.
"The gates will also reduce the length of route that has to be closed, making it easier to maintain access to local businesses and residential properties in the area," Mr Ashton added.
