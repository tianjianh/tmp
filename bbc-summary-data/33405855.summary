A "selfless and brave" grandfather who died while trying to rescue two teenage girls from the sea was a strong swimmer originally from Gwynedd who knew the beach he was on, his family have said.

Richard Guest, 74, and another person, went into the sea in Tywyn, Gwynedd, at about 15:45 BST on Saturday but had to be recovered by coastguards.
He was pronounced dead at Bronglais Hospital in Aberystwyth.
Mr Guest, who lived in Walsall, West Midlands, was on holiday with his wife.
He and Margaret Guest, 71, had been walking their dog on the beach when the girls got into trouble after getting caught in a rip tide.
A statement issued by his family said: "One of the girls came out of the water unaided but the other girl was still in distress.
"He was about 40 yards out from the shore and was seen holding one of the girls up out of the water in his arms by the time Aberdovey coastguard arrived and managed to save the girl."
Mr Guest was airlifted by the Welsh Air Ambulance Service to Aberystwyth.
His daughter Ceri Donovan said: "We cannot imagine life without him. He was loved by so many people.
"Dad was brought up in Bethel, near Caernarfon, north Wales, and attended Ysgol Syr Hugh Owen.
"He was a strong swimmer and was used to swimming on that particular part of the beach. It was just like him to do something so selfless and brave."
Mr Guest, who had two children and four grandchildren, had worked as a bank manager at the former Midland Bank and a financial manager. He had played for Handsworth rugby club where he remained a keen supporter.
Mrs Donovan added: "He was an active man who loved the outdoors, and was at his happiest in Tywyn with his family.
"At the end of the day, he was a family man. He was a great father and a much-loved grandfather. We will miss him terribly."
Scores of tributes were posted on the Love Tywyn Facebook page, describing Mr Guest as brave, kind man and a "true hero".
