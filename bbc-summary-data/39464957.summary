The Owls spurned numerous fine chances before the break, but scored twice after half-time through guided headers from Tom Lees and Steven Fletcher.
Jonjo Shelvey, who had earlier hit the bar from inside his own half, smashed home to set up a nervy finish.
But the sixth-placed Owls held on to ensure Newcastle remain second.
The Magpies are two points behind leaders Brighton & Hove Albion, who leapfrogged Rafael Benitez's side with victory over Queens Park Rangers on Friday.
But, most crucially, Newcastle still hold a 10-point gap to third-placed Huddersfield after defeats for the Terriers and Reading on Saturday - meaning three wins from their final five games will guarantee an instant return to the top flight.
Newcastle, who along with Brighton have occupied a top-two spot since October, were never at their best against Wednesday, with Gary Hooper and Fletcher both missing gilt-edged chances early on.
Top goalscorer Gayle hobbled off injured soon after, although Shelvey's audacious first-time strike from inside his own half almost put the visitors ahead against the run of play.
But Lees' header back across goal and Fletcher's superbly steered effort from a long throw-in put Wednesday in command after the interval, and they held on to complete a league double over Newcastle, despite Shelvey's late consolation.
Sheffield Wednesday boss Carlos Carvalhal told BBC Radio Sheffield:
"We had a fantastic day as we're playing against the best team in the competition with a high standard.
"I think we completely deserved the victory.
"We didn't feel any kind of pressure, zero, as we look at us. Even if we didn't win today we depend on us.
"We never talk about the teams near us, we are talking all the time to try and win the next game."
Newcastle manager Rafael Benitez:
"It is very disappointing, we didn't do what we had to today, we made too many mistakes.
"We gave them chances at the beginning. After we started the second half much better we had chances and were on top of them, then we gave a silly foul and gave a goal away from it.
"We didn't manage the situation the way we have to. We had some chances at the end and their keeper was making saves.
"We have to wake up and be ready for the next game. We have five games to play and we are in a good position."
