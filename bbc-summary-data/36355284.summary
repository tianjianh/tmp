Michael Laverty was sixth in the first Superbike race of the day but failed to finish the second because of a blown engine, so drops to fifth spot overall.
Jordanstown rider Andy Reid was fourth in both Supersport events but heads the standings on 85 points.
Fermanagh's Josh Elliott was third in the Superstock 1000cc race while Carl Phillips won the Superstock 600cc race.

Keith Farmer, a winner at Oulton Parjk on May Day, failed to finish the Superstock 1000cc outing, while Andrew Irwin was fifth and eighth in the Supersports.
Record-breaking North West 200 hero Alastair Seeley was 14th and 17th in the Superbike class on his BMW, with Glenn Irwin 13th in race one, but retiring in race two with just a third of the race completed.
