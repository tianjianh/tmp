A dumper truck manufacturer has announced a further 65 redundancies at its North Lanarkshire base.

The job cuts are the latest to hit the workforce in Motherwell, which has more than halved since a peak of 630 employees in 2009/10.
Management at Terex Trucks blamed market conditions and a downturn in global demand.
The company produces articulated and rigid trucks which serve industries such as construction and mining.
In the latest round of cuts, subject to a statutory consultation period, 55 jobs on the shop floor will go, along with 10 administrative positions, leaving a staff of 300.
The firm started producing trucks in Motherwell in 1950 and was acquired by Volvo in 2014.
GMB Scotland organiser Alan Ritchie said: "These latest cuts mean more manufacturing misery for Lanarkshire and the Scottish economy, coming less than 24 hours after grim growth forecasts and the threat of a Scottish recession.
"Generations of Terex workers have delivered decades of world-class manufacturing here in Motherwell but, as we've seen at the likes of Tannoy in Coatbridge, a proud history counts for absolutely nothing.
"Let's be clear that Scottish manufacturing is in total freefall and our slide towards a low-skill, low-wage economy gathers apace without any meaningful intervention from the Scottish or UK governments."
