Two 19-year-old men who were arrested over an attack on a car belonging to the chairman of Nottingham Forest have agreed to write letters of apology.

Fawaz Al Hasawi's Mercedes-Benz Viano was vandalised while parked outside the iPro stadium during Derby County's match against Forest on 17 January.
The car had its rear windscreen wiper and personal registration plate torn off and its tyres deflated.
Derbyshire Police said writing a letter was a form of "restorative justice".
The two men were filmed vandalising the vehicle after the game which Nottingham Forest won 2-1.
Supt Gary Parkin said: "The two individuals will return on bail. Once they've returned they will be given the opportunity to write letters of apology.
"They've agreed to do this... Nottingham Forest and the chairman are comfortable with this at the moment and that will be restorative justice."
In a separate incident, on the same day, a fan ran on to the pitch to confront Nottingham Forest players.
On Tuesday, Joshua Gregory, 23, of Chaddesden, pleaded guilty to pitch encroachment and a public order offence.
