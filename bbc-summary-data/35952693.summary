The Foxes can go seven points clear with six games left, should they win at Southampton on Sunday.
But after Harry Kane's 22nd league goal of the season, Pochettino said: "We dropped two points but with six games, we need to believe and fight.
"We showed we are ambitious and want to fight for the title."
Spurs host Manchester United a week on Sunday, by which time they could be 10 points behind Claudio Ranieri's side, who travel to Sunderland earlier the same day.
Tottenham, searching for a first top-flight title since the 1960-61 season, are now four points ahead of third-placed Arsenal, who have a game in hand.
But Pochettino said: "Leicester have a tough game against Southampton and deserve to be in the place they are but in football anything can happen. We have to fight until the end of the season.
"It was difficult to come here and try and win the three points but we were calm and believe in our quality.
"We feel disappointed but we still need belief and to be ready for the next game."
Kane's goal, following Philippe Coutinho's opener, made him Tottenham's leading scorer in a Premier League campaign.
His 22 league goals are the most scored by a Spurs player since Gary Lineker's 28 in 1991-92, the season before the Premier League began.
Pochettino said of his striker: "Harry Kane, for me, is one of the best strikers in the world. Today, again, he showed I am not wrong."
Kane said: "I am very proud of my achievement. You want to score in every game you play in. They feel even better when you get the three points. It would have been nice to go on and win the game."
The England striker added: "I think it's two points lost - we wanted to put the pressure on Leicester."
