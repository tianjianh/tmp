A UFO spotted over St Tudwal's Islands in the Llyn Peninsula in Gwynedd and a "slow-moving disc" seen at a festival in Llanfyllin, Powys, are included.
The 34 files released by the National Archives cover 1985 to 2007.
Accounts of sightings over Anglesey, Denbighshire, Cardiff and Swansea are also detailed.
The files include requests for information about UFO sightings in south Wales made by various newspapers and confirmation that a reported UFO incident over Swansea in 1998 was either RAF Sea Kings or Vampire planes.
The UFO spotted over the St Tudwal's Islands was caught on a weather web cam on 8 May, 2006 and said to be "hanging in the sky" by one spectator.
However, the MoD said the picture was not clear enough to conclude what it actually was and it had received no other UFO sightings for that date.
The disc shape spotted at the music festival at Llanfyllin in Powys was reported to be four different colours - blue, green, white and orange - and was spotted by festival-goers as they waited to be picked up.
Witnesses said it was a few hundred feet in the air and was moving up and down in the sky "quite slowly" and their eyes were "glued" to the lights.
An MoD official responded, saying: "We are satisfied that there is no corroborating evidence to suggest that the United Kingdom's airspace was breached by unauthorised aircraft."
Another reported sighting in Bangor in on 26 August, 2000 involved a staff member from Coleg Menai, who contacted RAF Valley on Anglesey after seeing a "fireball or meteorite" facing the Snowdonia mountains.
The report states that after being spotted in the air, the object "followed a fairly shallow trajectory and then plunged into Llyn Cefni, which was down the slope from where we were sitting, and approximately 80m away.
"The object appeared much bigger than the houses and farm buildings which were on the opposite side of the lake, and towards the end of trajectory almost appeared to be flaming, rather than 'glowing'."
This sighting was also dismissed by the MoD, as it was not corroborated by any other sightings.
Other highlights from the files include:
The files are available to download for free for a month from the National Archives website.
