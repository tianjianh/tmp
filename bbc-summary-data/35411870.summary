Peterborough United left-back Kgosi Ntlhe is set to leave the League One side when his current deal expires at the end of the season.

The South Africa international has made only five appearances for the club in 2015-16 after having toe surgery.
"Kgosi's been offered a contract and he's turned it down multiple times," said chairman Darragh MacAnthony.
"We've given him the security of a good contract but he didn't want to sign it so I guess we move on."
Ntlhe, 21, made his Peterborough debut in April 2012 after coming through their youth system.
"We'll hold his registration and if he finds a club and gets fit in the summer we'll get compensation," MacAnthony added to the club website.
"I think for players of that age group, and particularly someone who's got an injury prone record at the moment, he needs to be playing football."
