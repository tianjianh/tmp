[SN]TITLE[SN]
Ant and Prince Charles - is a double handshake ever a good idea?

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A good old British handshake. Defined by the Oxford English Dictionary as "an act of shaking a person's hand with one's own, in greeting or farewell, or as a sign of assent, good will".

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Simple, effective, easy to get right. Works at every level of society.
So when TV presenters Ant and Dec spent a few days in the company of the Prince of Wales to film an ITV documentary marking the 40th anniversary of the Prince's Trust, keen etiquette watchers were quick to use social media to comment on Ant's handshake with the prince who will one day be king - and perhaps even say "Arise, Sir Anthony".
The prince offers Ant his hand (Ant had earlier broken royal protocol by making the first move). Ant shakes it firmly and then places his left hand on top in one classic variation of what is popularly known as the "double handshake".
To provide some context, the exchange was wrapping up an "informal chat" in which Prince Charles said his Welsh home would be a "nice place" for Dec's (then) upcoming honeymoon and thanked the pair for being "nice to my darling wife".
Thankfully for Ant, there was no regal flinching following his supposed faux pas - a testament to the fact that the TV duo had built up a warm relationship with the prince. But is a double handshake ever an appropriate move?
Etiquette experts Debrett's never comment on an individual's behaviour but their website clearly sets out what is expected in a handshake:
Handshakes are brief, and should preferably be accompanied with direct eye contact. Do not complicate the greeting with other forms of touching - hands on the back, double-handed handshakes etc. Britain is still a comparatively non-tactile society.
The origins of the double-handshake are often credited to former US President John F Kennedy but in recent years it has often been labelled as "a politician's handshake" and associated with false sincerity.
And in business circles, it is often associated with one-upmanship. The Definitive Book of Body Language, by Barbara and Allan Pease, labels it the "double-hander" and says it "communicates dominance through intimacy".
The authors advise it should only be employed in situations where a hug would also be acceptable - which naturally rules out most business, political and royal encounters.
Leading etiquette expert William Hanson, who provides coaching to individuals and businesses - including those who are about to meet royalty - is quite clear that a double handshake is almost always best avoided.
He said: "Body language experts will say it shows insecurity. If you use your free hand on top of the handshake, you are entrapping someone by saying 'I'm on top of you'.
He says the classic example of that was after the 2010 election when the Conservative/Lib Dem coalition was formed and David Cameron welcomed Nick Clegg to Downing Street - an occasion when both politicians wanted to be seen to be "in control" of the handshake.
In social life, Mr Hanson agrees there are times when the double handshake might seem more natural - such as long-time friends greeting each other after a long absence and adding a touch of intimacy as they continue chatting and shaking hands.
But he says that he advises his own clients - who include several VIPs - that simple is always better.
"A good handshake is sadly very rare.
The double handshake is not really advisable and certainly not with someone you have not met before. It is a little insincere."
