The claim for £24,769,932, which needs to be validated, could result in the unknown ticketholder receiving the windfall as early as Monday.
Camelot did not say if the winner was an individual or part of a syndicate, or where the ticket was bought.
The winning numbers in Friday's draw were 3, 20, 28, 31 and 49, with Lucky Stars numbers 2 and 5.
A National Lottery spokesman said: "After an unprecedented nine UK EuroMillions winners in 2015, it looks like the luck has rolled over into 2016.
"We are delighted the latest big EuroMillions winner has come forward to claim their prize and, of course, the champagne is on ice ready to welcome them into the National Lottery millionaires' club."
EuroMillions began in 2004 and the biggest prize in UK history was £161m, won by Scottish couple Chris and Colin Weir in 2011.
