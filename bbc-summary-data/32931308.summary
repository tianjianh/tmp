Sandra Charles' spent 375 hours knitting 350 strands out of thousands of recycled label transfers
Ms Charles, of Somerset, got the idea while at a recycling centre.
Her work is on display with other students' projects at Nottingham Trent University, including lingerie inspired by wartime love letters, and two-dimensional clothing.
Ms Charles said: "I wanted to develop my sculpture work and my knitting. I looked at different techniques and saw arm knitting.
"It's very difficult to describe but basically uses your arms as needles. It took three hours to make each strand at first - I got repetitive strain injury at one point and couldn't do any more for a couple of days."
Other work includes Chloe Bampton, a fashion design student, who created lingerie inspired by her grandparents' war time love letters.
Ms Bampton, from Dullingham, Cambridgeshire, said: "When you read through their letters you imagine yourself in a different way of life completely.
"They are so romantic. We've lost touch with the era of hand letter writing and courting and I wanted to design lingerie which provided an alternative to the modern day shock element."
Her grandparents Dennis and Kathleen Algar married shortly before Mr Algar was sent to fight. He spent four years in a Japanese prisoner of war camp.
Meanwhile, South Korean student Dahye Jee designed concept clothing which appears two-dimensional, inspired by vintage paper dolls.
All the work is on display until 6 June.
