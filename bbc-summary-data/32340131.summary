Sellafield construction workers vote for industrial action

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Construction staff working at the Sellafield nuclear site in Cumbria have voted to take industrial action in a row over health and safety, the Unite union has said.

The dispute also concerns their sub-contractor employer's refusal to allow a full-time union shop steward.
Workers will decide what type of industrial action they will take, at a meeting next week.
Sellafield Ltd said it was "not directly involved" in the dispute.
A spokesman said the discussions did not involve any of the company's employees.
"We hope all parties can reach agreement. Safety and security at the site will be unaffected by any resulting industrial action," he said.
Talks broke down on Wednesday and 98% of Unite members supported action, the union said.
Unite regional officer Steve Benson said members had "lost patience" with management.
"All they are asking for is their rights for a co-worker to become a union shop steward at the Sellafield site to represent construction workers and keep them safe."
