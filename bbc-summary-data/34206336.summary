The inmate, who has not been identified, has been placed on a segregation unit and police are investigating.
A Prison Service spokesman said all incidents are fully investigated.
"Any violence in prison is unacceptable - especially when it is directed at our hardworking staff," he said.
"All incidents are fully investigated and prisoners found guilty can find their sentences extended significantly."
