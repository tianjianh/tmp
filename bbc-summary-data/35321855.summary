[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Mike Buckley, a parish councillor in Saddleworth, Oldham, was found guilty of making indecent images of children at Manchester Crown Court.
Saddleworth Parish Council's chairman said it was "inappropriate" for the 68-year-old to carry on.
Mr Buckley, of Dobcross, said it was his "responsibility" to continue serving his constituents.
"Individuals' views on whether I should stand down from the parish council are just that - their views," he said.
"I do not intend to enter into a sparring match with other members of the parish council or other politicians who may choose to express their opinions on my conviction."
Mr Buckley, who was sentenced on Wednesday, was made subject to a 28-day curfew between 08:00 and 16:00 GMT and ordered to complete a treatment programme for sexual offenders.
He will also be supervised by the Probation Service for the next two years and must sign the sex offenders register.
Council chairman Neil Allsopp said he had referred the matter to the authority's solicitor to establish if Mr Buckley is in breach of his contract.
He said: "I do feel it would be in everybody's interests if Mike Buckley resigns.
"I hope when he realises the strength of feeling he will agree with us."
