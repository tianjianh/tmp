East Anglian coast pollution targeted by 'eye in the sky' camera

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Potential sources of pollution affecting the East Anglian coastline are being targeted by a camera thousands of feet above ground level.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The camera mounted in a small aircraft is being used by Anglian Water to monitor sewage from businesses or farms that might end up in bathing waters.
It can spot pollutants that cannot easily been seen from the ground.
The company hopes evidence from the Â£350,000 camera will help persuade offenders to fix the problems.
The camera can see anything that measures more than 2cm (0.8in), from a height of 610m (2,000ft).
This could include run-off from fields housing farm animals or pollutants and sewage coming from businesses, caravan parks or old outflow pipes.
Dr Lu Gilfoyle from Anglian Water said: "We don't have the power as a water company to prosecute but we do have the Environment Agency who can, but we are far more interested in working with the businesses along our coastline than we are with prosecuting anybody."
