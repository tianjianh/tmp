The other game in the group also finished in a draw, with Forfar Athletic winning their shoot-out after a 2-2 draw at home to Dumbarton.
Dundee were ahead through Kane Hemmings before the break.
But Kevin Smith equalised for the League Two champions before the Fifers came out on top 4-2 on penalties.
At Station Park, League Two outfit Forfar took the lead through Josh Peters.
Grant Gallagher levelled for the Championship side after the break, Thomas O'Brien edged the Loons back in front, but Garry Fleming ensured a draw from the penalty spot.
Forfar were reduced to 10 men in stoppage time when Jamie Bain was sent off, but the home side took the bonus point by winning 5-3 in the shoot-out.
East Fife manager Gary Naysmith: "A League One club holding a Premier club like that is encouraging. It's a start for us and I won't be getting carried away.
"In the first 15 minutes, we were the dominant team and then as you'd expect Dundee came into it and had a lot of possession.
"Their goal knocked us a bit and we lacked that bit of belief, but we went a bit more attacking and went 4-4-2 and it worked.
"We ended the game as the dominant team again."
Dundee manager Paul Hartley: "We just couldn't get up the park in the second half, we couldn't get out. We didn't threaten their goalkeeper at all.
"It's not losing on penalties that concerns me, it's that second-half performance.
"We didn't pass the ball as well as we did in the first half and didn't handle the conditions, but I need to give East Fife credit as well for how they played."
