[SN]TITLE[SN]
Burnley v Lincoln City

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Burnley will again be without midfielder Jeff Hendrick, who is serving a three-game ban.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Robbie Brady is also unavailable as he is cup-tied, having played for Norwich in the FA Cup earlier this season.
Lincoln City have no fresh injury problems but Lee Beevers remains out with a long-term knee injury.
Joe Ward, who was ineligible against parent club Brighton in the last round, is available again but fellow on-loan winger Josh Ginnelly is cup-tied.
Jonathan Pearce: "Can Lincoln become the first non-league club to reach the last eight of the FA Cup since QPR in 1914?
"I witnessed at first hand the ambition, drive, determination and organisation of the Imps when they beat Ipswich in the third round.
"The Cowley brothers look a fine management team in the making. Their team will work until they drop.
"But Burnley have lost just three of their last 29 home games; Sean Dyche should be a candidate for manager of the year and, if he picks his strongest available team, they should have too much - but it'll be tight."
Burnley manager Sean Dyche: "You have to be mentally prepared for the fact there's 11 out there trying to beat you and not take it for granted because they're that many places below you.
"There's not a divine right to win football matches, you have to earn everything you get."
Lincoln manager Danny Cowley: "It's a tough test for us, they are an outstanding team at home and it will be a monumental task for us to get a win.
"It's a one in one hundred chance of winning because we have to match them technically and tactically.
"But we have to go there believing we can and will be that one game in one hundred."
I think that Lincoln, more than fellow National League side Sutton, are the real success story of the FA Cup so far...
Burnley away is probably one of the worst draws they can have, though.
Prediction: 2-0
