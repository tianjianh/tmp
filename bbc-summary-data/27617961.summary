Sherlock: His Last Vow is up for four prizes, with stars Benedict Cumberbatch and Martin Freeman nominated for their performances as Sherlock and Dr Watson.
The Good Wife, Big Bang Theory, Fargo, Masters of Sex and The Normal Heart lead the nominations with five apiece.
The awards are handed out in Los Angeles on 19 June.
The best TV movie category features British dramas Burton & Taylor, Sherlock and An Adventure in Space and Time, about the making of Doctor Who.
David Bradley, who played the first Doctor, William Hartnell, is in the running for best actor in a movie or mini-series alongside the BBC's Dancing on the Edge star Chiwetel Ejiofor and Mark Ruffalo from HBO's The Normal Heart.
The hotly-contested category also features Cumberbatch and his Sherlock co-star Freeman, who is nominated for his performance in Fargo along with Fargo co-star Billy Bob Thornton.
The drama, which airs on Channel 4 in the UK and is inspired by the Coen brothers' film of the same name, is also nominated for best mini-series.
American Horror Story: Coven, Bonnie & Clyde and BBC dramas Dancing on the Edge, The Hollow Crown and Luther complete that category.
"British drama is on a roll internationally now and these awards rightly celebrate a range of talent both on screen and off and we salute them all," said Kate Harwood, head of BBC in-house drama.
Harwood said she was "very proud" so many BBC shows had been recognised.
Other British nominations include Helena Bonham Carter for her performance as Elizabeth Taylor in Burton & Taylor.
Four British actors are nominated for best actor in a drama series: Michael Sheen for Masters of Sex, Matthew Rhys for The Americans, Hugh Dancy for Hannibal and Freddie Highmore for Bates Motel.
They have stiff competition in the form of Breaking Bad's Bryan Cranston and Oscar winner Matthew McConaughey.
His show, True Detective, has also been nominated for best drama series alongside The Americans, Breaking Bad, Game of Thrones, The Good Wife and Masters of Sex.
The best actress in a drama series features House of Cards star Robin Wright, Lizzy Caplan for Masters of Sex and Vera Farmiga for Bates Motel.
Prison drama Orange is the New Black has been nominated in the best comedy series category and battles Big Bang Theory, Louie, Veep, Silicon Valley and Broad City.
The nominations for the awards, run by the Broadcast Television Journalists Association (BTJA), are listed in full on the Critics Choice Awards website.
They also include nods in the best reality host category for Cat Deeley, for So You Think You Can Dance and Gordon Ramsay, for the US version of MasterChef.
