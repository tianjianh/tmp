The niece of a murdered woman whose killer has gone on the run has said she fears he may harm someone else if he is not caught.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
William Kerr, 53, absconded from a bail hostel in Hull following his release on 23 January.
He was handed a life sentence in 1998 for killing Maureen Comfort, whose body was found in a bedroom cupboard.
Police have warned people not to approach Kerr, who they have described as "dangerous".
Senga Bailey, who found her aunt's dead body, said: "I'm frightened of what he's going to do next."
Ms Comfort, 43, was strangled to death at her flat in Cromwell Heights, Burmantofts, in 1996.
Her niece said Kerr, a lodger, had continued to live there after the killing "as if nothing had happened".
Mrs Bailey, of Hunslet, Leeds, said she was still haunted by the discovery of her aunt's body.
"Everywhere I go it's there, it's always in my head," she said.
"He may keep away from us but if he can live with a dead person stuffed in a cupboard for a couple of weeks and sit there and watch TV, then what is he?"
North Yorkshire Police, which is leading the hunt for Kerr, believe he is now in the London area but said he also has links to Humber and West Yorkshire.
