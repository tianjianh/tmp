Police said the "mainly intact" torso was discovered in Tolka Valley Park, in Finglas, on Monday.
Nolan, originally from Finglas, had served jail sentences for rape and burglary. He disappeared in November 2010 aged 46.
A dismembered arm, which washed up on Dublin's Dollymount beach in 2011, was later confirmed to be his.
GardaÃ­ (Irish police) began searching the Finglas park on Saturday 1 April after new information came to light.
Supt William Carolan told the media on Tuesday that police notified the state pathologist as soon as the remains were found.
The torso has been removed to the city mortuary where a post-mortem examination is being carried out.
Supt Carolan said they could not yet confirm that the torso was that of Nolan and DNA analysis was required.
Nolan's family has been informed and a police family liaison officer is in contact with them.
The dig will continue for about 10 days, with about half of the site already searched.
