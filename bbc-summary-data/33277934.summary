Jabo Ibehre: Carlisle sign former Colchester striker

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Carlisle United have agreed a one-year deal with striker Jabo Ibehre, with a view to a further 12 months.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Ibehre, 32, left Colchester United at the end of last season after loan spells at Oldham and Barnsley, three of his eight professional clubs.
His most profitable spell came with Leyton Orient, for whom he scored 41 goals in 243 appearances.
"Jabo will give us a focal point," Cumbrians boss Keith Curle told the club website.
"I've said before that we have needed more attacking options. He's a good, solid professional."
