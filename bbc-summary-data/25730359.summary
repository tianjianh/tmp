According to figures published by the Department of Health, that was an increase of 16 over the previous year.

However, 14 women were aged 24 and under.
According to the department the abortions were performed within legally acceptable and medically approved conditions.
Unlike the rest of the UK abortion is only allowed in very restricted circumstances in Northern Ireland.

There is strict assessment regarding any impact on mental well-being and the woman must consult with two clinicians.
