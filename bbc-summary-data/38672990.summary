Centre-back Curtis Davies is out with hamstring problem, but new signings Lazar Markovic and Omar Elabdellaoui could make their debuts.
Manchester United defender Marcos Rojo is available after missing the league draw at Stoke through illness.
Luke Shaw could start but Eric Bailly is still unavailable.
The Ivorian is returning to Old Trafford after his side's elimination form the Africa Cup of Nations but will not feature at Hull.
Red Devils manager Jose Mourinho says the club face a fixture logjam should they avoid defeat against Hull and reach the final at Wembley.
The final, against Southampton, takes place on 26 February, the date which United were originally scheduled to face local rivals Manchester City in the Premier League.
"I know that it's going to be hard if we go step by step," said Mourinho. "The match against Manchester City I'm sure they will choose an amazing moment, difficult for us, to make us play against them.
"Then we have Europa League, a non-stop competition. In the Europa League you have to play last 32 and last 16. If we are going to progress it's going to be really difficult."
Tigers head coach Marco Silva said Mason's injury has put a season in why the club are battling against relegation into perspective.
The Portuguese said: "At this moment we need to forget everything. The most important is the player and his family - the other things are not important.
"It is important to support the player and his family. Of course it's not an easy moment for us, the team."
