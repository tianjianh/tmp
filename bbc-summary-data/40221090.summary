Moyes' comments came following the Black Cats' home draw against Burnley in the Premier League.
The Scot was asked by Sparks if the presence of Sunderland's owner Ellis Short had put extra pressure on him.
Moyes, who resigned as Sunderland boss in May, subsequently expressed "deep regret" for his comment.
Moyes responded to Sparks' question about Short's presence by saying "no", but after the interview added she "might get a slap even though you're a woman" and told her to be "careful" next time she visited.
Both Moyes and Sparks were laughing during the exchange and the former Everton and Manchester United manager later apologised to Sparks, who did not make a complaint.
Speaking at a news conference on 3 April after the incident came to light, he said: "It was in the heat of the moment. I deeply regret the comments I made.
"That's certainly not the person I am. I've accepted the mistake. I spoke to the BBC reporter, who accepted my apology."
