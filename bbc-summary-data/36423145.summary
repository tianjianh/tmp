Imbert, who was 93 when he died, also took part in a US-backed coup in 1963 against the leftist President Juan Bosch.
He later formed part of a military junta established after the coup and was declared president in 1965.
He also helped fight off the insurrection which aimed at returning Juan Bosch to power,  which eventually sparked a US invasion.
Imbert was himself shot by followers of Trujillo in 1967, but survived.
