Viktoria Gribovskaja claims Cox was angry and told her: "I will get rid of you. I will do you in the Irish way."
The WBO European super-middleweight, real name James Russan, was charged following the incident on 16 July.
The 29-year-old has previously denied common assault, violence to secure entry, harassment and criminal damage.
The couple began dating in 2014, after Swindon-born Cox met Ms Gribovskaja in a London nightclub where she was working as an exotic dancer, Croydon Magistrates' Court heard.
But according to Ms Gribovskaja, tensions had been building between them after the 2006 Commonwealth Games gold medallist accused her of being unfaithful.
She told the court that Cox had called her a "slut" in a series of abusive text messages from 13 July in the run-up to the alleged incident.
Three days later, she said she called police after he arrived at her flat in Lambeth at 01:00GMT "banging" and "screaming" for her to "open the door".
A "shouting" Cox then got in to her bedroom and told her to pack her things before grabbing her by the throat, according to Ms Gribovskaja.
"He was in front of me. He started to squeeze. I could not do anything. I could not breathe. I could not push him away," she told the court:
"I remember I touched his hand. I think probably he saw me scared. He stopped."
He left in his car before police arrived, it is claimed.
The trial continues.
