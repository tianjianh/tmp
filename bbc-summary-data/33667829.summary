A part of Newport could be made a designated area for prostitution.

Plans being considered by Gwent Police could see a non-residential area of Pill specified for use by prostitutes.
This follows a similar pilot scheme in the north of England.
A police spokeswoman said: "Local officers and councillors are realistic about the fact that prostitution will always exist and it has been shown that enforcement alone is not an effective solution."
The force said the plans were in the early stages and no decision would be made until officers looked at evidence from other initiatives and consulted with residents, businesses and the council.
"The number of prostitutes in Gwent is small but the small number that operate do so mostly in the Pill area of Newport, which is impacting the lives of local residents," the spokeswoman added.
"While we closely monitor and work with individuals involved in off-street prostitution, on-street prostitution has proven more difficult."
Gwent Police said similar schemes had increased the reporting of offences against prostitutes and allowed other agencies to work with women to help them leave the sex industry.
