Having improved defensively, Kilmarnock had struggled for goals since the arrival of Clark in mid-February but after a slow start the home side started to create chances.
A great cross from Josh Magennis found Boyd in the box and his shot beat Alan Mannus only to his the post.
The goal-hungry Kilmarnock faithful would get the breakthrough they desperately craved. A free-kick was awarded on the edge of the St Johnstone area and Boyd fired into the bottom corner - his first goal since December.
There was a huge sense of relief in the wild celebrations, from both players and fans.
St Johnstone tried to respond and almost equalised through Craig, but his close-range shot was superbly saved by the outstanding Jamie MacDonald.
Kilmarnock almost went further in front, Higginbotham playing the ball into the path of Boyd to pull the trigger but Tam Scobbie appeared from nowhere to make a vital block.
Immediately after that Kilmarnock had the ball in the net, Higginbotham with the strike but it was ruled out for offside.
Magennis went close either side of half-time and Scobbie had a chance to shoot for Saints but blazed high into the stand.
Kilmarnock were soon 2-0 in front. Magennis crossed from the right and Higginbotham made no mistake with a downward header at the back post.
Craig then netted with a header at the other end but a push on Mark O'Hara meant there was no goal.
St Johnstone's Bulgarian defender Plamen Krachunov was next to be denied, his header brilliantly saved by MacDonald.
Kilmarnock would wrap up all three vital points right at the end. McKenzie was fouled in the box and from the spot Boyd was on target again as the home side claimed what could be a huge win as they attempt to beat the drop.
