[SN]TITLE[SN]
Carlisle United 0-1 Newport County

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Tyler Blackwood came off the bench to give Newport County their first win of the season against in-form Carlisle.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Cumbrians are League Two's top scorers but were perhaps fatigued from their League Cup penalty shoot-out loss at Liverpool in midweek.
Blackwood had only arrived at Newport on Thursday on an emergency loan from Queen's Park Rangers.
But the striker, 24, made an immediate impact on his debut, heading home from a Nathan Ofori-Twumasi cross.
Newport County manager Terry Butcher told BBC Wales Sport: "It was a great relief in the end, I think the referee had a calendar not a watch!
"But when that final whistle blew it was a lovely feeling because the boys have worked so hard, especially in today's game.
"We were under a lot of pressure, Carlisle played well, knocked the ball around well - we've had to put some good blocks in and the goalkeeper [Joe Day] has made some good saves."
