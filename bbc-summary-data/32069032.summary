[SN]TITLE[SN]
Richard III's burial takes place

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The remains of King Richard III have been buried at Leicester Cathedral.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A special service took place during which actor Benedict Cumberbatch, who's a distant relation of the king, read a poem.
The poem was specially written for the occasion by poet Carol Ann Duffy.
Richard III died at Bosworth Field in 1485, at the end of the War of the Roses.
His remains were found beneath a Leicester car park in 2012.
Across three days this week, more than 20,000 people queued for hours to view the coffin in Leicester Cathedral.
Today many people watched the service outside of the cathedral on a large screen.
Who was Richard III?
• Richard III was the last Yorkist King of England, this means he was the last member of the House of York family to be made king.
• Richard had one of the shortest reigns in British history - just over 2 years, and he was the last English king to die in battle.
• He was killed at the Battle of Bosworth in 1485, which led to the end of the War of the Roses. This was fighting between the houses of Lancaster and York that lasted 30 years.
• Richard III has been painted as a villain. It's said he killed his two nephews so he could take the throne and William Shakespeare wrote a play about him but some historians say this was propaganda and might have been unfair.
