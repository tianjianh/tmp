[SN]TITLE[SN]
AC Milan 2-2 Inter Milan

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Ivan Perisic rescued a dramatic derby draw for Inter Milan in Stefano Pioli's first game in charge.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Suso had looked set to be AC Milan's match-winning hero with two goals, before Perisic pounced in injury time.
Ex-Liverpool winger Suso curled home Milan's opener before Antonio Candreva smashed in an equaliser.
Suso scored again from a jinking run but Perisic turned home a corner from close range to deny Milan the chance to go 11 points above their rivals.
Read how the action unfolded here.
Former Lazio boss Piolo took charge of a Nerazzurri game for the first time, having been named Frank de Boer's replacement during the international break.
A derby defeat would have been the worst start imaginable, especially one that would have left them 11 points behind their rivals.
But Inter deserved their draw, with Candreva's first equaliser a brilliant 25-yard effort, and they took risks in the end, with goalkeeper Samir Handanovic coming up for the corner which Perisic converted.
Match ends, Milan 2, Inter Milan 2.
