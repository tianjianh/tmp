The singer will perform 20 shows under the banner Lionel Richie - All the Hits through April and May, and September and October next year.
The cheapest tickets, which go on sale on Friday, start at $59 (Â£38).
Richie, 66, said the decision was made to perform after consulting his 21-year-old son, Miles.
"I asked him, 'so Miles, what do you think about Vegas? Should I do it?'," said Richie.
"He goes, 'Oh my God, dad. We are going to have the great time. We are going to have the greatest time."
The singer played the traditional Sunday afternoon legends slot on the Pyramid Stage at Glastonbury in June.
His 80-minute performance is regarded by many as one of the highlights of the weekend.
His Vegas shows will include hits such as All Night Long (All Night), Hello and Dancing on the Ceiling.
Richie is also to be honoured by The Recording Academy as its MusiCares person of the year.
Previous recipients include Sting, Bono and Aretha Franklin.
Performers at the event on 13 February include Pharrell Williams, Luke Bryan and Lady Antebellum.
"I think Stevie (Wonder) is coming maybe," said Richie. "But first of all, let me tell you, what a great honour.
"When you're in that group of honourees. When you start thinking about Dylan and Streisand and stuff ... that's quite an accomplishment."
