[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The UK government aims to publish a draft Wales Bill next week, Welsh Secretary Stephen Crabb has said.

It comes a week after First Minister Carwyn Jones called on him to postpone the process.
The two met in Cardiff on Monday, with Mr Crabb vowing to reach agreement with the Welsh government on the content of new devolution legislation.
A spokesman for the first minister said it was "a constructive discussion".
The UK government hopes to publish the final bill in February, with Royal Assent anticipated for early 2017.
Mr Crabb said both he and the first minister were "on the same book, not quite on the same page" regarding any future devolution settlement.
"We have made progress in the last seven days and I think there is greater understanding certainly on our side of the concerns that the Welsh government have got - I think there is more understanding on the Welsh government side of the concerns that we've got," he said.
"I think what we need to do now is continue the talks and work purposefully towards a successful outcome and I think that is achievable."
The first minster had called for the publication of the draft Wales Bill to be postponed in order to reach a settlement "that stands the test of time" - but that request has been denied.
"We haven't changed the timetable for publishing at all, it's my aim to publish a draft bill next week which won't be the final bill but we'll provide people with the opportunity to feed in their thoughts, ideas and concerns," Mr Crabb added.
A spokesman for the first minister said: "It was a constructive discussion. It will be difficult to come to a settlement without properly addressing the issue of a single jurisdiction, but talks will continue."
The Welsh government wants to see a a separate Welsh legal jurisdiction, saying that such a move "would simplify devolution to everyone's benefit".
But the UK government and former Labour Attorney General Lord Morris of Aberavon have questioned the need and the cost of such a change.
Plaid Cymru AM Simon Thomas claimed devolution had now become "a race to the bottom" between the two governments which he feared could limit the scope of new powers for Wales.
"Right around Whitehall departments there are attempts to claw back powers as part of the reserved powers model," he said.
"We do expect to see a very weak bill now which undoubtedly will start some people discussing the need for yet another bill almost immediately."
