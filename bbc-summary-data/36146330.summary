[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Derbyshire and Glamorgan played out a tame draw as bad weather disrupted play for the third afternoon in a row.

Glamorgan reached 87-2, 119 ahead, with captain Jacques Rudolph on 31 not out.
Earlier, Andy Carter extended his career-best score to 39 before falling to Michael Hogan (4-74) as Derbyshire were bowled out for 345.
A hailstorm hit the County Ground in mid-afternoon after snow, sleet, rain and bad light had all stopped play over the four days.
Glamorgan head coach Robert Croft told BBC Wales Sport: "We've seen it all, we've had rain, sleet, snow, hailstones and we've seen some good cricket.
"I think we did improve from last week (against Leicestershire) which was important. The good thing is that there's still room for improvement again.
"Hopefully we can go up a notch or two again against Kent."
