[SN]TITLE[SN]
Queen Victoria's stockings fail to sell at auction

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A pair of Queen Victoria's silk stockings have failed to sell at an auction in North Yorkshire.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The hosiery, dating from the 1870s, is embroidered with the royal VR monogram and went under the hammer at Tennants Auctionneers in Leyburn.
The auctioneers had expected the stockings to fetch between £400-£600 despite their less than pristine condition.
The firms said the hosiery might still be bought by an after-auction bidder.
Under garments belonging to Queen Victoria do sometimes come up for sale as she would give away hosiery as gifts to people who worked for her.
The black and cream silk stockings were not in pristine condition with several areas of discolouration and stitched repairs.
