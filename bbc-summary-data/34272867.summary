Stepping Hill Hospital deaths: 'Unrelated' to poisoning

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Ten people who were patients when killer nurse Victorino Chua worked at Stepping Hill Hospital later died from "unrelated causes", inquests have found.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 49-year-old was found guilty of murdering two patients and poisoning 20 others in May.
Chua was convicted of poisoning, or attempting to poison, six of the ten people for whom the inquests were held.
A further four were people whose deaths were investigated by police.
No criminal charges were brought in relation to those deaths.
Verdicts of death by natural causes were recorded against three of the four "new" cases of Vera Pearson, 84, Hannah Hull, 89, and Raymond Jenyon, 86.
The death of George Keep, 84, was accidental following a fall in the road, his inquest heard.
Chua was convicted of attempting to cause grievous bodily harm to Beryl Hope, 70, Linda McDonagh, 60, Mary Cartwright, 69, William Dickson, 82, and John Beeley, 73.
They also later died of natural causes, recorded South Manchester Coroner John Pollard.
Marietta Pawlyszyn, 86, who Chua tried to administer poison to by altering her prescription chart, died as a result of misadventure following complications in heart surgery, her inquest heard.
Chua was jailed for life with a minimum of 35 years for killing Tracey Arden, 44, and Derek Weaver, 83 and poisoning 20 others.
Concluding the inquests in Stockport, Mr Pollard said: "We have heard a number of inquests today in relation to those people who had the misfortune of being patients at Stepping Hill Hospital at the time when Chua was carrying out his crimes.
"As a result of that, inquests into the deaths of those patients have been considerably delayed and I apologise to each and every one of the families of the deceased for that delay. And I thank them for their patience and forbearance in the meantime."
