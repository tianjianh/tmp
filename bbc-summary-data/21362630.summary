Peter Hargreaves, co-founder of the investment company Hargreaves Lansdown, said he could balance the authority's books "in a morning's work".
Mayor George Ferguson has to find Â£35m in spending cuts.
"I'm getting people from all walks of life coming in to help with new ideas at the city council," Mr Ferguson said.
He added: "I'd welcome Peter coming in."
Mr Hargreaves said he would like a list of all the departments in the city council and hear "all the things they're supposed to do".
"I could balance this city's budget in a morning's work," he claimed.
