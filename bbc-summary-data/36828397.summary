Jack Gudge, 17, was found unconscious on Wimborne Road, Winton, at 00:55 BST on Saturday but he died later in hospital.
Police have urged people to stop making threats on social media and Jack's family has urged people to stay calm.
Four people from Bournemouth have been arrested and released on police bail.
Earlier, people attended a vigil near Jack's home in West Howe, releasing balloons into the sky in his memory.
Jack's mother Jolene Keenan paid tribute to her "wonderful, beautiful, funny son" and said she was releasing another photo of him in the hope it would encourage more witnesses to come forward.
Three men, aged 23, 24 and 27 and a boy aged 15 were all detained on suspicion of murdering Jack.
A post-mortem examination revealed Jack had sustained a brain injury, but the exact cause of death was not clear. Further tests are due to take place.
Ms Keenan urged people in the area to "remain calm".
Chief Insp Mike Claxton, of Bournemouth police, said: "There've been some comments that I believe have gone out on social media... with people either making threatening, insulting, inflammatory or incorrect comments and I'd urge people not to use social media for that means."
