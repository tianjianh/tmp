The Dutch thrower had edged through his semi-final with 16-time world champion Phil Taylor 11-10 in a deciding leg.
But he eased to an 11-6 win in the final to retain the trophy he first lifted in 2015.
"I had a bit of luck today but I'm really happy to win the trophy," said 26-year-old Van Gerwen.
The 2014 world champion dropped only four legs in wins over Stephen Bunting and Michael Smith, but was fortunate to progress to the final as Taylor missed seven match darts to defeat him in the last four.
Chisnall, from St Helens, came from 8-0 behind to beat Robert Thornton 10-9 in round one before impressing in victories over Vincent van der Voort and James Wade to reach the final.
Both players are in the 10-man field for the 2016 Premier League tournament, which starts in Leeds on Thursday.
