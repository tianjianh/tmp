A town with one of the "worst" festive displays in Britain is to switch on its new tree eight months before Christmas.

The 2014 tree, surrounded by metal barriers in Liscard, Wirral finished seventh in the 13 Worst Christmas Trees in Britain poll on Buzzfeed.
The tree was spruced up after residents set up a Facebook page complaining that the town "deserved better".
It will be officially switched on later to give a "taster" of how it will look.
Danny McLeod from Argyle Taxis and the manager of the town's Cherry Tree Shopping Centre John White teamed up to organise a winter wonderland in spring.
They got firm Christmas Decorators onboard who suggested staging the Light Up Liscard event to show "shoppers what they can have when Christmas comes early".
Geoff Hodgson from the company said: "They'll be a switch on, there will be Father Christmas here, mulled wine, an ice queen and artificial snow basically just to show people what they can have."
He said: "This is just a taster for [shoppers].
"When they decide what they want we can decorate the whole street so it will be spectacular to try and encourage people to shop here."
