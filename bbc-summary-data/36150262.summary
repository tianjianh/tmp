Leicester City's success in the Premier League will be sustained, according to former owner Milan Mandaric.

The Foxes will win the title for the first time in their 132-year history if they beat Manchester United on Sunday.
Mandaric, 77, sold the then Championship club to Thai businessman Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha in 2010.
"Knowing those people, they will go as high as possible," he told BBC Radio Leicester. "They're very ambitious people. They're not going to give up,"
Mandaric added that the club was "now in their blood" and they were part of something they "never dreamed of", adding: "It's not just the money any more."
Leicester have a seven-point lead over Tottenham at the top of the table and need just three points from their final three games to guarantee the title.
Alternatively, if Spurs lose one of their three matches, the Foxes, who started the season as 5,000-1 outsiders, will be crowned champions.
Under Mandaric's ownership, Leicester were relegated to League One in 2008 but returned to the second tier with Nigel Pearson as manager the following season.
The Serbian-American, who previously owned Portsmouth and Sheffield Wednesday, is now chairman of Slovenian side Olimpija Ljubljana.
"I don't think Leicester will be one of those one-offs," he added. "I think they'll continue and see what's possible. They're not going to let go."
