County Durham revellers warned not to 'drink and drown'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A safety campaign warning revellers about the risk of falling into rivers is under way in County Durham.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Don't Drink and Drown urges people to act responsibly near water, especially if they have been drinking, and reminds of the risks of walking home alone after a night out.
T-shirts, wristbands and water bottles are being handed out and licensed premises feature posters and beer mats.
Students are being targeted as they are seen as particularly at risk.
Between October 2013 and January 2015 three students died after falling into the River Wear during nights out in Durham.
The campaign has been set up by drowning prevention charity the Royal Life Saving Society UK and the Safe Durham Partnership (SDP) - which includes Durham County Council, police and the fire service.
It is also being supported by the university, local colleges and licensed premises.
Councillor Joy Allen, the county council's portfolio holder for safer communities, said: "Rivers are extremely unforgiving places especially once you've had a few drinks.
"Our advice is simple. Please don't be tempted to go into the water. Avoid walking home near rivers if at all possible and encourage your mates to do the same thing."
