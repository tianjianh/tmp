SYHA Hostelling Scotland said three additional summer youth hostels will open in Edinburgh, Glasgow and Perth between June and August.
The new hostels will be based in existing student accommodation vacated during the summer months.
The announcement follows a refurbishment of Portree Youth Hostel on the Isle of Skye.
Edinburgh University's halls of residence on the Cowgate will provide 199 spaces, with 110 at the Glasgow School of Art's Margaret Macdonald House and 65 in Perth College's student residence.
The hostelling organisation said visitors would be offered a choice of self-catering apartments and single, double, and twin rooms.
SYHA Hostelling Scotland chief executive, Keith Legge, said: "In response to customer demand we are again delighted to be providing extra accommodation in three popular city destinations - Perth, Edinburgh and Glasgow.
"All three youth hostels are perfectly situated for city tourist attractions, outdoor activities, cultural and music festivals and events, shopping, restaurants and bars; as well as for onward travel to our other hostels throughout Scotland."
The organisation will build a new youth hostel at Glen Nevis later this year.
