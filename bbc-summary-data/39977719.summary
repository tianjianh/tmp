Kilmarnock: Jordan Jones' future could hinge on manager decision

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Kilmarnock winger Jordan Jones admits he may quit the club if interim boss Lee McCulloch does not land the manager's job on a full-time basis.

McCulloch has led Killie to top-flight safety but the club have yet to reveal whether that has earned him the job.
And Jones, who has been offered a new contract, said: "Could that sway my decision? Yeah it could.
"If someone else were to come in that would probably make me think twice about staying on."
And the winger added: "That's just because I've got so much faith in the manager we have here right now.
"It's not just me, if you see the results we've had as a team under Jig (McCulloch) and the way we've been performing as young players then there's every reason to think a lot of us will go on to bigger and better things."
Former Middlesbrough man Jones, 22, has enjoyed a fine first season at Killie after signing under previous manager Lee Clark last summer.
He has been in talks over a new deal but is now "waiting to see what happens with the management situation" before making a decision.
McCulloch took over in February following Clark's departure to Bury and Jones says the former Scotland midfielder has had a hugely positive influence on him and the team as a whole.
"I'm really progressing under Jig and Peter Leven (assistant boss) right now," he added.
"They have both been really good with me and the team, and if I keep progressing it's only going to benefit me by staying here.
"It's been a good year both personally and as a team.
"We've all done well, especially since Jig's been in charge. We've come together and the mentality has really changed. We're all looking to get better and better.
"If we could get seventh place by beating Ross County this weekend it would cap off a good season.
"The main reason for me moving up was to play week in, week out and that's what's happened. The first part of the season has really helped me understand the defensive side of the game a lot better. Jig has said to me if I lose the ball it doesn't matter as long as I do the defensive side.
"So that has given me total freedom on the ball which is great. I think you can see that coming through in my performances now."
