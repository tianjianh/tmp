South Sudan profile - Media

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
South Sudan's media face immense logistical, economic, social and political challenges.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Newsgathering can be difficult and the communications infrastructure is poor.
Radio is the most popular medium. Scores of private stations, some with foreign funding, have sprung up. There is a national state-run network, and each of South Sudan's 10 states has its own radio station.
The Catholic Church and Internews, a US-based media development organisation, are key players in the radio scene. The BBC World Service broadcasts to Juba on 90 FM (Arabic) and 88.2 FM (English).
Though expensive for many locals, newspapers rank second to radio in popularity. Most publish in English and are printed in Uganda or Kenya.
State TV has little competition. The development of TV is hindered by poverty and a limited electricity and telecoms infrastructure.
Media freedom is fragile. Armed groups, weak legal institutions and political pressures undermine free reporting. Journalists risk arrest over reports that criticise the government and the ruling party.
There have been reported seizures of newspapers, or disruption of their distribution, by the authorities.
Web access is limited to the main towns. Diaspora members are the most active social network users.
