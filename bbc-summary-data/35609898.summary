The 41-year-old was shot as he sat in a car with his partner in Rossnareen Avenue in west Belfast.
Police have renewed their appeal for information.
They believe his attackers came out of a vacant house and were wearing high visibility workmen's jackets.
Two men have already appeared in court charged with making threats to kill.
