Mr Agnew, fondly known as Aggers, was a bowler for Leicestershire before joining BBC Radio Leicester and then the BBC's Test Match Special.
His suggestion that Ian Botham had failed to "get his leg over" was voted the greatest sporting commentary ever in a poll.
Mr Agnew said he was "really thrilled" to be made MBE.
"It's great to get a pat on the back no matter what you do and this is a big pat," he said.
"Test Match Special is a tight knit crew and I look at this as a team award.
"I've also been able to be more of an all-rounder, having done the Olympics and royal events, but I know cricket, and cricket on the radio is my home".
The famous "leg over" comment was broadcast on 9 August 1991, while commentating on the day's play at the Oval on Test Match Special.
Aggers and the late Brian Johnston both dissolved into helpless laughter.
"People have tried to write off radio but it is unique," Mr Agnew said.
"It is warmer and more personal and on long programmes like Test Match Special it is like a soap opera in terms of the characters the listeners get to know.
"It gets cricket and sport out there to new and wider audiences."
Claire Lomas, who completed the London Marathon in a robotic suit, is also among Leicestershire's New Years Honours recipients.
The 36-year-old has been appointed MBE for charitable and voluntary services to spinal injury research.
Ms Lomas has raised more than Â£570,000 for charities since being paralysed from the chest down in a horse riding accident in 2007.
As well as completing the London Marathon in 2012, Ms Lomas hand-cycled 400 miles around England in 2013, and completed the Great North Run in September while 16 weeks pregnant.
Her challenges have raised money for Spinal Research and the Nicholls Spinal Injury Foundation.
