Full-back Glen Johnson says he would "love" Liverpool midfielder Joe Allen to sign for Stoke City.

The Potters had a Â£13m bid for Wales midfielder Allen, 26, accepted on Thursday by the Anfield club.
And Johnson is excited about the prospect of his former team-mate coming to the Britannia Stadium.
"He's a fantastic player. He'd be brilliant for the squad - he's one of those players who gets the game going," Johnson told BBC Radio Stoke.
Swansea are the main rivals for Allen's signature, but Johnson would not hesitate to recommend Stoke to him.
"Of course I would. I've enjoyed every minute here and I'd pass that on if he called or texted me," he said.
"I'd personally love him to come here. He's an out-and-out footballer - the Stoke of old doesn't really exist any more, that era has gone, we're a footballing side now."
Johnson's first season at Stoke was ended by a knee injury suffered against Bournemouth in February.
The 31-year-old was back in contention for the final game with his old club West Ham, but was not risked.
"As I jumped I got kicked at the same time it was a strange one but when you have contact injuries anything can happen," he said.
"The toughest part is missing the football and trying to remain sane in the physio room.
"I feel good and strong. I could've played the last game, but we agreed there wasn't any point taking a risk but I hoping for a fully-fit campaign this time - I can't wait to get going."
