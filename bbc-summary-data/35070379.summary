Lessons have been cancelled at Howdenburn Primary in Jedburgh since the incident happened on Wednesday night.
Scottish Borders Council said it will remain closed while a damaged wall is assessed and repaired by experts.
From Monday until the end of term, pupils will be taught at alternative schools in the town.
Children in classes P1-4 will be expected to attend Parkside Primary, while Jedburgh Grammar School will accommodate the older children.
Alternative arrangements have also been made for nursery children.
Parents have been invited to a meeting to discuss the arrangements, including travel plans, on Friday.
A Scottish Borders Council spokesman was unable to confirm when the school would reopen.
He said: "Details of the repairs required are still to be finalised but parents and the local community will be kept informed of progress."
The high winds on Wednesday also caused disruption to roads in the region.
Two men were injured, one seriously, when they were hit by a falling tree on the  A7 south of Galashiels.
