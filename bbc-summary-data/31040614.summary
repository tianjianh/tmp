"The poppy, an iconic feature of the rural Tasmanian landscape, has been developed as a tribute to those who fought in World War One," the Rupertswood Farm in Hagley wrote on their Facebook page.
The maze has been created in a field of sorghum, a grass crop which is used for food and animal fodder.
It opens to the public on 21 February.
"It's probably more to reflect all of the people who fought in the First World War," farmer Rowan Clark told ABC News in Australia.
"We grow poppies on our farm, it's our main crop so we thought it was a good fit."
Mr Clark and his wife Anna used GPS technology and a ride-on mower to create the design.
They believe the maze would grow to up to eight feet (2.5m) high.
"Hopefully at the opening, it will probably be about four, five feet high, and then it'll get even bigger after that. I think at the end of last year, our crop maze was about seven or eight feet high," he said.
After the attraction closes, the sorghum crop will be baled for silage.
Last year the pair designed a maze in the shape of a tiger, which more than 2,000 people are thought to have visited.
