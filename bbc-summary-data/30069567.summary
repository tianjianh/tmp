Sam Smith: No egos from the stars in the Band Aid 30 studio

With some of the biggest names in music gathering in one studio to record a track, you might think there would be one or two "egos" in the room.

But Sam Smith said that was not the case for charity single Band Aid 30, and everyone was "pretty chilled out".
"There's a really good spirit in there actually," he said, speaking to Newsbeat at the recording in London.
"There's not a lot of ego. Everyone's pretty chilled and just looking to do a good job for the cause."
One Direction, Emeli Sande, Rita Ora and Ed Sheeran are among some of the names set to appear on the song, which aims to raise money to help the Ebola crisis in West Africa.
"I'm very excited to do something for the cause and that's the main thing for me," said Smith.
"I really want to draw the focus in on that, that's what I'm excited about the most."
Ellie Goulding, Sam Smith, Chris Martin and Bono are also singing on the track, an updated version of Do They Know It's Christmas?
"I'm actually a bit nervous because the song might be in a really bad key but again it's not about how my voice sounds in terms of whether it's suitable for me," said Smith, before recording his part.
Many of the stars dropped other commitments in order to be a part of the fundraising.
Rita Ora was the first to record her lines and left early so she could travel to Salford to film BBC One's The Voice.
Ed Sheeran flew in from his tour in Germany, while Bastille cancelled two US arena gigs to be involved.
Other artists taking part include Elbow, Seal, Jessie Ware, Fuse ODG, Sinead O'Connor, Angelique Kidjo, Olly Murs, Paloma Faith, Queen drummer Roger Taylor, Clean Bandit and Foals.
Nick Grimshaw was also at the studio, to "help" with the recording.
"I really want to sing, like so much, but I've definitely been told I can't because my voice is awful," he said.
"But I keep saying to Bob [Geldof], surely it's a choir and I can just sneak in at the back."
Bob Geldof, who is behind the appeal and organised the original track in 1984, said he addressed the participants "like the headmaster" before they sang the chorus.
"I said, 'OK, this is what it's about. When you sing this, be aware that the rest of the world will be singing it with you.'
"I explained the situation in West Africa, I explained what the UN were saying, explained what we could do, and just geed them up."
Many of the musicians involved were children when the first Band Aid single was released 30 years ago - and some weren't even born.
"I grew up watching the two Band Aids that happened and watching Live Aid and all of that was incredible," said Smith, who is 22.
"This is all amazing but a day like today just highlights what it's really about if I'm honest."
