Police were called to Gainsborough House in the early hours of Friday morning, after reports that a woman had fallen from the fourth floor.
Ms John-Baptiste, of Enfield, was taken to hospital but died shortly afterwards.
Police are treating her death as unexplained.
A 24-year-old man was arrested at the scene on suspicion of causing grievous bodily harm and bailed until late September, pending further inquiries.
Det Ch Insp Neale Baldock of the Metropolitan Police appealed for witnesses or information about the incident.
"We are especially keen to hear from anyone who may have witnessed what occurred on the victim's balcony prior to her fall to help us with our investigation," he said.
Ms John-Baptiste is reported to have worked for Liberty Gas, a central heating engineering company.
