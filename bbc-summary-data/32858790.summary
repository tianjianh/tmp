The Army's newest regiment, the Scottish and North Irish Yeomanry, has held its first parade in Northern Ireland.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The locally recruited TA soldiers marched from the Cenotaph to a church service in Carrickfergus on Saturday morning.
The event also commemorated a World War Two battle in which the regiment's forerunner, the North Irish Horse, played a pivotal role in breaking through German lines in Italy in May 1944.
The squadron's commanding officer, Major Mark Gannon, said: "This is the first time that we've paraded as a squadron of that regiment.
"It's a very proud history that we have with the North Irish Horse which dates back to 1944 for this particular event.
Major Gannon said the regiment had been given permission by the Canadian army to feature the maple leaf on its uniforms in honour of the "sacrifice and commitment that was made" by the regiment's soldiers.
