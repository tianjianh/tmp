Sir Tim Smit says the "money is in place" for the Eden Westwood project.
The tourism and leisure complex would be built at junction 27 of the M5, near Tiverton, and would "focus on the key strengths and attributes of Devon".
It is understood the main funding for the project would come from the Friends Life insurance company.
The founders of Eden Westwood said its centrepiece in will be "The Ark" which will be "an iconic structure and educational facility that will showcase Devon's finest produce".
The scheme will also include a surf lake and beach, a hotel, a regional visitor centre and a designer outlet village.
Sir Tim said: "If the people of Devon want it to happen it will 100% happen because the money is in place and the people to build it and dream what's in it are there.
"It will probably be somewhere between £100m and £150m, it'll be in that area.
"There will be a lot of jobs created directly at the site itself but more importantly our belief is what should be creating is a place that points out all the fantastic things in Devon itself so you come to this place.
The proposals have been submitted to Mid Devon District Council for inclusion in its draft 2013-2033 Local Plan.
