Durdle Door steps reopened after two-year repair wrangle

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Steps leading down to one of the UK's most famous coastal landmarks have reopened - more than two years after they were removed.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The footpath to Durdle Door on the Jurassic Coast was damaged in a series of winter storms.
Work to rebuild the steps was carried out amid a row between Natural England and owners the Lulworth Estate over who was responsible for maintaining them.
Repairs were funded from car parking charges at the Door and Lulworth Cove.
James Weld, from the estate, said the beach is the most visited part of the Jurassic Coast.
He said it was important for people to be able to get up close to the Door, which had only been accessible via a steep clay path since January 2013.
"It's a national icon as well as one of Dorset's icons, so we're delighted to be able to reopen it, but it's sad it's taken so long."
