Therese Johaug: Norwegian skier gets provisional doping suspension

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Norwegian three-time Olympic cross-country skiing medallist Therese Johaug has been given a provisional two-month suspension pending a full investigation into her positive doping test.

The defending World Cup champion tested positive for the steroid clostebol.
The Norwegian ski federation said the substance had come from a lip cream.
"The fact that she has been suspended means she has some degree of fault,'' the attorney for the Norwegian Anti-Doping Agency said.
"Which degree of fault is what we will now investigate."
Johaug said she would not appeal against the decision and would instead focus on "working for a full acquittal".
The suspension means Johaug will miss the start of the World Cup season.
The Norwegian ski federation said the steroid had been in a lotion given to her by team doctor Fredrik Bendiksen to treat sunburn on her lips during high-altitude training in August.
The team doctor has since resigned, describing the violation as his "personal mistake as a doctor".
The Norwegian Anti-Doping Agency is investigating the case further and will determine the appropriate penalty for both Johaug and Bendiksen.
Under international anti-doping rules the seven-time world champion could face between a two-month suspension and a four-year ban.
Johaug's anti-doping violation comes three months after Norway's top male cross-country skiier and 2014 Sochi Olympic bronze medallist Martin Johnsrud Sundby was given a two-month suspension after testing positive for salbutamol, an asthma medication.
Norway have dominated men's and women's cross-country skiing in recent years, winning 11 medals at the last Winter Olympics, including five golds.
