If you're a regular on Snapchat, you'll have seen a pretty cheery clip introducing the Discover update.

But while being described as "a new way to explore stories" it also rearranges the app's menu and removes the ability to see other people's "best friends".
Despite Snapchat CEO Evan Spiegel tweeting "we'll bring back BFs soon," some users are still a bit cross.
Unsurprisingly it seems Snapchatters like a good nosy around who their mates have been chatting to.
Explaining why the feature disappeared, Evan Spiegel added: "A few higher-profile friends wanted to keep their usernames private - we'll come up with a better way to do that."
Snapchat's best friends feature allowed users to view the top three people their contacts were interacting with.
The list was determined by the number of times you exchanged messages with a particular friend and couldn't be manually controlled.
It was the only way of knowing anything about how other contacts were interacting on the app.
However, some users backed the Discover update, which has seen Snapchat partner with media companies to feature videos and news articles on the app.
But others quickly forgot about their beloved best friends lists when they realised the app includes way more sloths now.
After 24 hours the stories disappear, in keeping with Snapchat's trademark feature of private messages that disappear a few seconds after they are viewed by users of the service.
Snapchat, which reportedly turned down a $3bn (Â£1.2bn) buy out offer from Facebook, it thought to have been valued has been valued at $10bn (Â£6.2bn).
The addition of news and entertainment content is the latest expansion for LA-based app and follows the launch of an online payments service in November.
