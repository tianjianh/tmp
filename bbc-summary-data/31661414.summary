Gloucester's Henry Trinder has been ruled out for the rest of the season after suffering another injury setback.

The 25-year-old centre made his first start since September in Saturday's 48-10 win over London Welsh, following hamstring and shoulder problems.
But he was stretchered off the field after only nine minutes after suffering a serious knee injury.
Trinder must now undergo surgery on the problem and will be sidelined until at least the summer.
Gloucester director of rugby David Humphreys told BBC Radio Gloucestershire: "We're so disappointed to lose Henry to another injury.
"More so for him. He's put so much work into this year to get back from two previous injuries. He's owed a little bit of luck."
Humphreys is optimistic Trinder will be fit enough to start the 2015-16 Premiership season, as it begins late in October because of the Rugby World Cup.
"He'll have a long pre-season and hopefully he'll be back into good shape again for the start of the new season," Humphreys continued.
Swindon-born Trinder has played 94 games for Gloucester since his debut in the 2007-08 season.
He was one of three uncapped centres in Stuart Lancaster's England squad for the autumn Tests last year, but was forced to withdraw through injury.
