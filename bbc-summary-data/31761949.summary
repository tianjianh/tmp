Three-year north-south 'Y Gerallt Cymro' express train deal

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An express rail service between Holyhead and Cardiff has been secured for another three years.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The train service, Y Gerallt Gymro, is funded by the Welsh government and provides a reduced journey time to the Welsh capital from Anglesey.
Aimed at business users, it is the only service on the route with hot meals.
The new funding deal will see Arriva Train Wales continue to operate the express until the end of the current Wales and Border franchise in 2018.
Announcing the agreement, Transport Minister Edwina Hart said: "I am committed to improving journey times and transport links between north and south Wales to promote economic growth."
The service calls at the major stations on the north Wales coast, including Bangor, Rhyl and onto Wrexham and Chester, before heading along the Welsh Marches, and into south Wales - knocking nearly an hour off the return journey.
