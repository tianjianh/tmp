With 100 days to go, the city announced the artistic programme for first three months of the year-long celebration in a ceremony at Hull Truck Theatre.
The first event will be an installation across the city, telling the story of the last 70 years of Hull.
Hull 2017 boss Martin Green said: "We're going to start with a bang."

"This city's voice has always been strong - in 2017 it will roar."
Mr Green said the year would start with a fireworks display on January 1, which would be "more spectacular" than the New Year's Eve show in London the night before.
Tate director Sir Nicholas Serota, Arts Council England chairman Sir Peter Bazalgette and former deputy prime minister Lord Prescott were among invited guests at the unveiling.
BBC Director General Lord Hall pledged to restore Hull to the BBC's national weather map in time for 2017.
The launch attracted a flurry of comments on social media.
Sophie tweeted: "Oh @2017Hull, I'm so very proud and excited about what you're doing for my great city, and so happy to be involved as a volunteer."
Michelle Alford, from Hull, posted on Twitter: "#hull 2017 Whoop whoop hull on every BBC weather map"
Phil Benson tweeted: "Fantastic launch event @2017Hull so many ace things, highlight Hull to be named on every BBC national weather forecast map".
Hull City Council said more than Â£1bn of investment had been attracted to the city following the announcement of it hosting the event in 2013, including more than Â£100m spent on upgrading and building arts venues and improving the environment.
Labour leader of the council Stephen Brady said he hoped City of Culture would provide a "lasting legacy for the city, the north of England and the country as a whole".
