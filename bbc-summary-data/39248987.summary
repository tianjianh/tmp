Hoey had posted three consecutive rounds of one-under 71 to lie two off the lead going into day four but ended the tournament on level par.
The Belfastman, 37, dropped shots at the 15th and 17th to lose ground.
Defending champion SSP Chawrasia, from India, won on 10 under, seven shots ahead of Malaysian Gavin Green.
Hoey, who lost his European Tour playing card last year, was joined on level by England's David Horsey and South African George Coetzee after the closing round.
The Northern Irishman's round included one birdie and four bogeys.
