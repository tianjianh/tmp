[SN]TITLE[SN]
Restriction order imposed on Dingwall rapist

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man who attempted to rape a girl and raped three women has had his minimum jail term reduced by appeal judges.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
John MacIntosh, of Dingwall, challenged the discretionary life sentence he was given in 2014 which ordered that he serve at least 10 years.
Judges at the Court of Criminal Appeal in Edinburgh have imposed an Order for Lifelong Restriction (OLR) on him.
They ordered that he must serve at least seven years in jail before he becomes eligible to apply for parole.
MacIntosh's counsel Claire Mitchell argued that judges at the Court of Criminal Appeal in Edinburgh could deal with him by imposing an extended sentence - involving a determinate jail sentence and a further period of supervision - and that it was not necessary for the court to impose an OLR on him.
Under an OLR the court imposes a minimum term to be served, known as a punishment part, but the offender would only be released when the parole board considers he no longer poses a threat to the community.
The Lord Justice Clerk, Lady Dorrian, sitting with Lord Menzies and Lord Drummond Young, said they could not agree with the submission that MacIntosh's risk could be adequately managed through an extended sentence.
The judges imposed an OLR on him, but ordered that he must serve a seven-year minimum period in jail before he becomes eligible to apply for parole.
Lady Dorrian said they would give reasons in detail in writing for their decision in due course.
MacIntosh was found guilty at the High Court in Aberdeen of raping three women and sexually assaulting and attempting to rape a nine-year-old girl.
The offences happened in the Inverness and Dingwall areas between 1996 and 2004.
He had previously been jailed for having sex with girls aged 13 and 14.
