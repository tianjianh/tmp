Eurostar passenger's artillery shell prompts evacuation

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Gare du Nord railway station in Paris was evacuated after a man tried to board a Eurostar train with an artillery shell in his luggage.

The man was hoping to take the train from Paris to London when the object was spotted.
The station was briefly evacuated and bomb disposal experts were called.
A spokesman for the SNCF rail company said the shell had been defused and posed no danger to the public.
It was from either World War One or Two, the spokesman said.
International and domestic trains were delayed while the inspection was carried out, but are now getting back to normal.
Services were already badly delayed by two other incidents - a fire on a nearby building site, and passengers on the track - earlier in the morning.
The Gare du Nord is the busiest railway station in Europe, and the busiest in the world outside of Japan. More than 190m people use it every year, or 520,000 a day.
