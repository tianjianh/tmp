[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]

The memorial service is being attended by Canadian Minister for Justice Peter MacKay and Indian Minister of State for External Affairs VK Singh.
Minister for Foreign Affairs Charlie Flanagan is representing the government.
The flight was en route from Toronto to Delhi when the explosion happened mid-air about 120 miles off the south-west coast of Ireland.
It was one of the worst aviation disasters in history and Canada's worst terrorist attack.
No-one survived the attack.
Dead, jailed and acquitted
Deadly puzzle pieced together
Relatives of loved ones who lost their lives have gathered in a memorial garden at Ahakista.
For relatives - mostly Canadians of Indian extraction - south-west Ireland remains a place of pilgrimage.
A memorial service is held every year to remember those who died.
The bomb was placed in the suitcase of a man who had checked in his luggage but did not board the flight.
The attack was the work of Sikh militants who wanted to strike at the Indian government after the Golden Temple at Amritsar - the most important shrine in Sikhism - was stormed by troops in June 1984.
