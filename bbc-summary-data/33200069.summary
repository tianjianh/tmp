Sir Bradley Wiggins will line up for the third Prudential RideLondon-Surrey Classic cycle race this summer.

Event organisers said it would be his first race on UK roads since setting a new UCI Hour Record at the Olympic velodrome earlier this month.
Huge crowds are expected to turn out to see the Olympic and world champion on 2 August.
Race director, Mick Bennett, said the cyclist now had "rock star status". "Every race wants Wiggins," he said.
The 200km race starts on Horse Guards Parade, heads out of London through Kingston upon Thames and past Hampton Court and then over the River Thames into Surrey.
The riders will face a 2.4km climb on Staple Lane in the Surrey Hills and will race through Dorking before going up Leith Hill - Surrey's highest point - and then follow the zigzags of Box Hill before returning to London.
Twenty five teams of six riders will take part - Wiggins will be leading his newly-formed team.
He said: "It's always fantastic to race on home roads and this race is very special."
London mayor, Boris Johnson, said people would line the capital's streets to see the world's top cyclists and British fans would shout even louder at the sight of Wiggins.
Surrey county councillor, Richard Walsh, said Wiggins was a cycling superstar who would perhaps inspire a future champion.
