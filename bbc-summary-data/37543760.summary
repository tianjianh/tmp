He told a press conference on Monday that Northern Ireland would be "collateral damage" in the time ahead.
Prime Minister Theresa May announced on Sunday that the UK would begin to formally leave the EU by the end of March 2017.
But Mr McGuinness said Northern Ireland would suffer economically and politically.
