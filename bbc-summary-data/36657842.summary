[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Rain prevented any play at Lord's as Middlesex's County Championship match with Division One leaders Lancashire was called off as a draw.

Umpires Paul Baldwin and Nick Cook decided to take an early lunch, but called it off at 14:30 BST.
Middlesex were 419-5 overnight, in reply to Lancashire's 513 all out.
Having started the game joint top with reigning champions Yorkshire, Lancashire now lead the Tykes, who have a game in hand, by nine points.
Middlesex picked up two extra batting bonus points to climb to third, above Durham.
With the match seemingly a stalemate anyway, even without the weather, the overwhelming odds had been on hands being shaken on a draw.
Lancashire, who face Yorkshire at Headingley in the T20 Blast on Friday night, are in Championship action again on Sunday when they play a Nottinghamshire side likely to be strengthened by England fast bowler Stuart Broad, fit-again captain/wicketkeeper Chris Read and new overseas signing Imran Tahir.
Middlesex go to Hove on Friday night to play Sussex in the Blast before heading to Scarborough on Sunday to face Yorkshire in the Championship.
Middlesex coach Richard Scott told BBC Radio London:
"It's frustrating again to lose a day and a bit out of this game. We've had a lot of those this season. But we're really pleased at how we've played. Especially the way that both Nick Gubbins and Stevie Eskinazi batted on Tuesday. They epitomise the skill and spirit in the side at the moment.
"Stevie didn't look at all out of place at number three. He's earned his opportunity because of his performances in the Second XI. He will play again at Scarborough, and he will get a real belief that he can compete at first-class level from this innings.
"Nick looks the real deal and has been very consistent this summer in partnership with Sam Robson at the top of the order.
Lancashire coach Ashley Giles told BBC Radio Manchester:
"That was the flattest wicket we have played on this year. We were heading for a draw here anyway. But, overall, we've got something out of the match and we'll move on.
"With the division very bunched up due to all the weather-affected games we've had, it looks like being an exciting Championship run-in.
"To play here in only his second first-class game was great experience for Matt Parkinson. On a flat pitch like this, the margin for error is so much less. But, ff he is to go on and play at the highest level - and I know he has aspirations to do so - then he's got to learn how to bowl on surfaces like this."
