Spending on agency staff at the Royal Cornwall Hospitals Trust has increased by 75%, a Freedom of Information request has revealed.

In 2015 the bill for agency staff was £13.1m, a rise of £7.5m on 2014's figure.
Health campaigners have said the figures are "incredibly worrying" and could seriously threaten the financial affairs of the trust.
The trust said reducing the amount it spent on agency staff was "important".
Trust chief executive Kathy Byrne said it had recently changed its approach to using agencies, recruiting over 200 substantive clinical staff and reducing the amount spent on agency staff in August by £300,000.
The FOI request revealed that spending with one nursing agency alone reached £1.1m in 2015/16.
The trust said it had introduced measures to try to recruit staff, including looking abroad for nurses.
Graham Webster from campaign group Health Initiative Cornwall said the increase was a "worrying trend".
"I think it exposes the acute shortage of nursing staff, particularly nurses but also other clinical staff, that we're having in Cornwall," he said.
Mr Webster said the staffing shortages were partly down to high house prices in the region and also the "intense pressure" of the job.
