[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
More than 4,000 people have responded to proposals unveiled in Telford and Wrekin Council's "most difficult budget ever", the authority said.

The Labour-run council may stop running community centres and some children's centres and libraries to save £30m.
The 4,013 responses will help it decide whether it increases council tax "above the government-assumed 2% increase" for adult social care services.
The feedback will also influence whether it changes any planned cuts.
The council said its government grant would be cut next year by another 20%, but the opposition Conservative group said there was £12m that could be used to protect front-line services.
The authority, which has also proposed spending less money on winter gritting and flower displays, said it had already made £80m of cuts since 2010.
Lee Carter, cabinet member for finance, said the high level of response was "no surprise" considering the valued services which were threatened.
"We're looking at people's views in more depth and the public's views will help us with decisions around the council's budget and council tax," he said.
The authority added discussions with partners or community groups about how they could run some services was "progressing well".
Great Dawley Town Council and Hadley and Leegomery Parish Council are expected to take on some services.
