She won eight league titles, nine FA Cups and a Uefa Women's Cup with Arsenal, whilst also achieving 129 England caps.
Byrne, also 37, won 11 league titles, 10 FA Cups and the Uefa Women's Cup.
But she lost her place to Dutch goalkeeper Sari van Veenendaal last season.
"We would like to thank Rachel for her outstanding contribution to the club, and wish her the very best for the future," the club stated on their website.
"Everyone at Arsenal would also like to thank Emma for her commitment and contribution to the club, and to wish her the very best for her future."
