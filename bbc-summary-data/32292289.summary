Reade has returned to the UK following a spell BMX racing in the US.
The 26-year-old won two world titles with Victoria Pendleton, claiming team sprint titles in 2007 and 2008, before focusing solely on BMX racing.
Reade wrote on Twitter: "BMX has been my life. But I 'm now ready for a new challenge in Rio 2016."
British Cycling technical director Shane Sutton said: "This is good news as Shanaze is a terrific athlete with a big personality and an appetite for competition.
"Shanaze is coming back to train with the squad with a view to seeing what kind of contribution she can make to the performance of the team."
