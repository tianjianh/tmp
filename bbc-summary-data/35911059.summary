Mr Cairns replaced Stephen Crabb as secretary of state for Wales earlier this month.
On a visit to Swansea he will speak in support of the drive to secure a second city deal bid for Wales after Cardiff Capital Region secured Â£1.2bn.
He will say the UK government recognises the potential the Swansea Bay city region has.
