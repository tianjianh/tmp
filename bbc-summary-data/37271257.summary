The 27-year-old, who has two caps for Sweden, had been training with the Robins after leaving Watford in July.
"He brings that experience, he's very assured as a human and also as a footballer," City boss Lee Johnson told BBC Radio Bristol.
"He's very calm in possession of the football and he's very calm in his decision making and defending."
The former Udinese man initially joined the Hornets on loan in 2012, before signing on a free transfer in July 2013, making 100 appearances in total.
