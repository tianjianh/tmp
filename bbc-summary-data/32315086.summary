Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg: "Someone is going to hold the balance of power on May 8 and it won't be David Cameron or Ed Miliband. But it could be Nigel Farage. It could be Alex Salmond. Or it could be me and the Liberal Democrats."
UKIP leader Nigel Farage: "UKIP has a plan, we genuinely want to make working people better off. And we will do that by leading the charge and making the argument for a low tax revolution."
Labour leader Ed Miliband: "There is so much all over the papers. If I got furious about what's all over the papers in the last four-and-a-half years, goodness knows what would have happened."
