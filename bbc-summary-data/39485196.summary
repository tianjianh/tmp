[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A multi-million pound centre of excellence for the oil and gas industry is to be created in East Kilbride.

The Scottish government said the centre would make Scotland a world leader in the measurement of liquid flow under high pressure.
It is also due to create at least 17 new jobs and safeguard 82 existing jobs.
The £16m subsea development centre is designed to help maximise economic recovery from wells.
German company TUV SUD has agreed to invest £11.1m in its site in East Kilbride to develop the centre after a £4.9m research and development grant from Scottish Enterprise.
The announcement was made during a visit by Economy Secretary Keith Brown to the Scottish Enterprise Technology Park in East Kilbride where the new facility will be built over the next two years.
He said: "It is a testament to the international standing of the oil and gas sector in Scotland that the company has chosen to make this investment.
"It also reflects the bright future that the oil and gas industry and its supply chain can enjoy, especially when supported by innovations such as this Centre for Excellence for Flow Measurement and Fluid Mechanics."
