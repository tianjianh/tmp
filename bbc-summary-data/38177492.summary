The Northern Irishwoman, 24, already had conditional status for next season and should earn several starts.
Meadow's closing two-under-par 70 at Daytona Beach left her on one under par for the five rounds.
That was three strokes outside an automatic qualifying position.
Meadow produced two rounds of 70 and three 73s during the five-day marathon.
Her round on Sunday included three birdies and a solitary bogey.
Meadow's best performance this year was a share of 10th place at the Canadian Open in August and that helped move her up from 419th to her current position of 259th in the world rankings.
The former Great Britain & Ireland Curtis Cup player finished third at the 2014 US Women's Open but the death of her father a year later was a huge blow to the Northern Irishwoman and she has been battling to re-establish herself in 2016.
"My status will come from (this year's) money list (115th). I should still get into lots of events," said Meadow after Sunday's round.
