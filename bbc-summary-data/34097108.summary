Belfast man Michael McNally jailed for tea towels theft

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man who stole 12 tea towels about 24 hours after he was granted bail has been jailed for two months.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Michael McNally, of Hillman Street in Belfast, was charged with stealing the cloths worth Â£78 from a souvenir shop in the city.
The court heard that McNally, 28, went into the Visit Belfast shop at 10:45 BST on Friday, lifted the items and left without offering payment.
McNally pleaded to the offence at Belfast Magistrates' Court on Saturday.
A defence solicitor told the court that shortly after McNally left the shop he was stopped by officers who spoke with him without any suspicions, but he told them: "I have stolen something - here you are."
The court was told that McNally had numerous convictions for theft and was in breach of a suspended sentence that had been imposed on 17 August for a similar matter.
The defence solicitor said McNally had stolen the tea towels "in an act of desperation" as he was hungry from sleeping rough the previous night.
The judge said he had granted McNally bail the day before the tea towel theft, and a condition of that bail was to stay away from the Visit Belfast shop.
He jailed McNally for two months and activated the suspended sentence to be served concurrently.
