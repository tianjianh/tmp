The widow of a man who was found dead in Renfrewshire has told a murder trial she "knew" that a body discovered in Langbank was that of her husband.

Michelle Toner, 46, told the High Court in Glasgow that she reported 34-year-old Martin Toner missing on 30 June 2004, after he failed to come home.
She said she knew the body found in Langbank weeks later was her husband's as that was the last place he had been.
Douglas Fleming, 50, and John McDonald, 57, both deny murdering Mr Toner.
Mr Fleming and Mr McDonald are alleged to have killed Mr Toner at the garden and grounds of the Coach House at Gleddoch Estate, Langbank, and Gleddoch Estate after inducing him to travel there from the Key to Life Gym in Pollokshields, Glasgow.
Mr Toner's body was found dumped in a field near Langbank on 13 July 2004. He had been stabbed and his throat had been cut.
Mrs Toner, who was married for 13 years and had two children with Mr Toner, told the court the last time she saw her husband was around 11:00 on 29 June 2004 when he left to go to the Key to Life Gym.
She told the court she phoned him about 14:45. "I just asked him if he was going to be home soon and he said he wouldn't be home quickly," she said.
Mrs Toner told advocate depute Alex Prentice QC, prosecuting, that when he failed to return home that night she made phone calls to his phone and got no answer.
She also phoned some of his friends and the only person who had seen him after the gym that day was Douglas Fleming, who had given Mr Toner a lift to Langbank.
On the morning of 13 July 2004, she was told there was a media report saying a body had been found.
She was asked by Mr Prentice: "In your heart of hearts were you expecting the worst," and she replied: "I was expecting bad news. I was very upset and knew it was Martin's body because that was the last place he had been."
Mrs Toner said that both Mr Fleming and Mr McDonald were at her home in Glasgow when the police arrived on the afternoon of 13 July to tell her the body had been identified as being her husband.
She said that she had asked Mr Fleming, who had told her he drove her husband to Langbank from the gym on 29 June, to come over so that she could ask him about that.
Mrs Toner told Mr Prentice that in the weeks before his death her husband had been chasing Mr Fleming for £50,000 he was owed for a property deal.
She added that Mr Fleming told her that he and her husband went to tennis courts in Langbank to collect £100,000.
Mrs Toner went on: "He said the money was in the tennis courts and Martin had collected the money. There was £100,000 - £50,000 each."
She told the court that Mr Fleming told her that he kept £10,000 and her husband went off with £90,000 in a rucksack.
Mr Prentice asked: "Did he say where Martin was going," and she replied: "He said he was getting a train to Bishopton."
Mrs Toner said she was surprised because her husband never used public transport.
Mr Prentice said: "It might be suggested you have told a whopping lie," and she replied: "I've no reason to lie."
The court also heard that Mr Toner, who ran a wheelie bin cleaning business, was also involved in the drugs trade and was due to stand trial at the High Court in Glasgow for drugs offences.
Mr Fleming has lodged a special defence of incrimination against six men.
Both accused also deny a further charge of attempting to defeat the ends of justice.
The trial before Lord Armstrong continues.
