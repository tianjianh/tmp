A man injured in an attack at a house in south Belfast on Wednesday in which a senior loyalist was killed has died in hospital.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Stanley Wightman, 51, had sustained injuries to his neck and arm and died in hospital on Friday afternoon.
Colin 'Bap' Lindsay, 51, a well-known member of the Ulster Defence Association (UDA), died at the scene.
Forty-six-year-old Albert Armstrong appeared in court earlier on Friday charged in connection with the attack.
A samurai-type sword is believed to have been used in the attack, police have said.
Police officers found the two men seriously injured in the living room of a house at Kirkistown Walk in the Belvoir housing estate.
The ambulance service was called but Mr Lindsay was pronounced dead a short time later.
Mr Wightman was taken to hospital and had surgery on his injuries.
Mr Armstrong had been charged with the murder of Mr Lindsay and the attempted murder of Mr Wightman.
It is understood that police will now have the second charge against Mr Armstrong amended after Mr Wightman's death.
