Anna Sexton died on 8 June soon after collapsing at her home in Cheltenham and being taken to hospital.
The teenager weighed nearly 22 stone and was receiving help and support to control her weight.
Gloucestershire Coroner's Court reached a conclusion of death by misadventure.
Assistant coroner Caroline Saunders said: "She had a propensity to gorge on food, particularly pickled eggs at night."
The court heard Anna lived with her paternal grandparents, Michael and Sally Sexton, but regularly saw her parents and siblings.
The couple said the teenager would regularly "sneak downstairs" to eat the eggs.
Coroner's officer David Peake said: "Anna had been eating a pickled egg and choked.
"Her grandfather slapped her on the back in an attempt to clear her airways but she collapsed on the floor."
He added that after she was taken to hospital, ambulance staff struggled to find an airway and found egg in her windpipe.
"Airway blockage was consistent with the account given by the grandparents.
"Pieces of egg were found in her tracheal pipe," Mr Peake said.
Pathologist Dr Linmarie Ludeman, who carried out the post-mortem examination, concluded the teenager died from asphyxia.
Ms Saunders added: "Despite engaging in services to support her weight loss, she continued to experience significant problems which were typified by a tendency to overeat."
