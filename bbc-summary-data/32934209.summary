[SN]TITLE[SN]
'Perverted' man, 64, jailed for historical sex abuse

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A "perverted" man has been jailed for 22 years for abusing a boy he groomed for sex in the 1970s.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Colin Wood, 64, from Barry, in the Vale of Glamorgan, was found guilty of eight offences of indecency and two further serious sexual offences.
Wood, of Somerset Road, was arrested after a naked picture of his victim was found in his bedside cabinet.
He denied any form of sexual misconduct but was found guilty after the victim gave evidence at Exeter Crown Court.
His victim told the jury how the abuse had blighted his childhood and cast a shadow over his life.
Wood was living in Braunton, north Devon, when he carried out the most serious sexual assaults on the boy, who was a teenager by that time.
He had been grooming the victim for sex for several years, during which he abused the child on a regular basis and ensured his silence by threats of violence.
He also took naked pictures of the boy, one of which was found by a witness in his bedside cabinet many years later.
In sentencing him, Judge Francis Gilbert QC told Wood he had "groomed the boy over a number of years and used him for his own perverted sexual gratification".
Wood was jailed after being told by the judge his crimes would now be categorised as male rape.
The victim said he had been too frightened to tell anyone about the abuse at the time but started to reveal his ordeal while at university and only went to the police two years ago.
The victim, now an adult, told the jury the abuse was "repulsive" and made him feel frightened, worthless and ashamed.
Wood told the court he had never had any sexual contact with the victim. He said the allegations were all invented and were nonsense.
