£10m of loans to regenerate town centres across Wales

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Twelve areas of Wales will receive loans to help bring derelict and vacant town centre buildings back to life.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The £10m pot would be used to turn them into business premises and homes.
Cardiff Bay's former Bute Road railway station could become "live-work units" and retail space where a military museum is also earmarked.
There is also cash to help turn Milford Haven's old Victoria Filling Station and Grade II-listed Quay Stores into a cultural centre.
It is the third and final phase of the Vibrant and Town Centre Loans Fund, with Communities Secretary Carl Sargeant considering what might replace it.
Money towards other projects include:
Mr Sargeant said: "This funding will help local authorities regenerate their town centres by helping them find sustainable uses for empty sites and premises such as affordable town centre homes or tourist and leisure attractions.
"As well as making town centres more attractive places to live this loan scheme will help encourage investment into these areas as well as support the local economy."
