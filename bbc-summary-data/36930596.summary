National League North winners Solihull Moors made a promising start to life in the fifth tier by beating southern champions Sutton 3-1.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Moors, playing at this level for the first time in their history, drew first blood at Gander Green Lane when Darryl Knights set up Ryan Beswick for a close-range opener in the 38th minute.
Sutton were level two minutes before half-time, though, Dean Beckwith heading home from a corner after the U's had enjoyed a dominant spell.
Marcus Bignot's Solihull secured all three points with two second-half goals.
Debutant Omari Sterling-James volleyed a 53rd-minute strike past Ross Worner and, 14 minutes from time, Shep Murombedzi flicked the ball into the path of Andy Brown, who scored in the far corner.
