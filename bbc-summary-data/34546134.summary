Rugby World Cup 2015: Wales driven on by 2011 pain - Gatland

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Wales are motivated by the pain of 2011 as they try to reach another World Cup semi-final, says Warren Gatland.

Wales face South Africa in Saturday's quarter-final determined to go further than 2011's semi-final loss to France, when Sam Warburton was sent off.
"We came away from 2011 feeling a little bit unfulfilled," said Gatland.
"We had a feeling we had done something reasonably special and didn't get a chance to get to the final obviously with that sending-off of Sam."
Gatland added: "If we can... reach the semi-final again that will be an awesome achievement."
Victory over South Africa at Twickenham would ensure another two matches for Wales, with the losing semi-finalists taking part in a play-off for third place.
"I don't think we're ready to go home on Sunday and I know the players aren't ready to go home.

"We're in a good place mentally. We feel we've played some pretty good rugby and we're competing with some of the top teams.
"You just need a bounce of the ball, a little bit of luck, a couple of decisions to go your way and you've got a chance of winning."
South Africa have dominated against Wales, losing only twice in 30 matches over 110 years.
But Wales won their last meeting in November 2014, emerging 12-6 victors in Cardiff, and were edged 31-30 in June of the same year in South Africa thanks to a penalty try two minutes from the end of the game.

Gatland says that in order to win Wales have to be prepared to try something new.
"You've got to be prepared to throw something a bit different in," said Gatland, citing the example of Wales' surprise 22-10 win over Ireland in the 2011 quarter final.
"We played that game a little bit differently and changed the way we wanted to play and that was effective," he added.
"There's so much analysis going on and with one or two subtle changes you can potentially catch a team by doing something a bit different.
"We've worked on a couple of things this week that hopefully South Africa haven't seen."
