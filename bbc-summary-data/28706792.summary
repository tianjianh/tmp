James Rodriguez was presented with the Golden Boot for finishing as top scorer at the World Cup on Friday - but says his only thought now is to secure a starting berth at Real Madrid.

The Colombia forward, 23, received the award in Madrid in recognition of his six goals in five games for Colombia.
Rodriguez's exploits persuaded Real to sign him from Monaco for Â£71m.

"I have big hopes," said Rodriguez. "But first I have to train well and earn my place in the team."
Rodriguez's volley against Uruguay in the last 16 was hailed by many as the tournament's most spectacular goal but the player himself says he favoured his run and chip against Japan in the group stage.
"It was something so special that will always stay with me," Rodriguez said of his goal against Uruguay, before adding on Fifa's website: "Personally I preferred the one against Japan.
"Those are goals that stay in the memory."
Rodriguez's exploits were the catalyst for Colombia's run to the quarter-finals, where they were beaten 2-1 by the hosts.
"I was hoping to win it because I have always dreamed of winning something like this," he added. "And this is also a source of happiness to my country Colombia. They gave me lot of strength so I could win the award."
Looking ahead to the challenge to come during his six-year contract at Real, Rodriguez said: "I hope to win titles here.
"I am now in a club that is always hungry for titles. And I think that if you want to play here you must always keep a high level of performance.
"And I am prepared for that. I hope I can win everything here."
