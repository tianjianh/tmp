Faneva Andriatsima struck the first on 27 minutes and Njiva Rakotoharimalala hit the second half-an-hour later.
Moussa Konate halved the deficit on 70 minutes before Southampton forward Sadio Mane levelled with 10 minutes remaining.
The second leg of the tie will take place in Dakar on Tuesday.
There were surprise results in Comoros and Swaziland as Ghana and Nigeria respectively were held to goalless draws.
It could have been worse for Ghana's Black Stars as Comoros forward Nasser Chamed had a goal controversially ruled out for offside.

The sides will meet again on Tuesday in Kumasi, while Nigeria will host Swaziland in Port Harcourt on the same day.

African champions Ivory Coast were made to work hard for their 1-0 win over hosts Liberia in Monrovia.
The Elephants were playing without key striker Wilfried Bony, who is injured, with Belgium-based Gohi Cyriac scoring the only goal on the stroke of half-time.
