The 21-year-old steps up to League One after helping Conference North side City reach the second round of this season's FA Cup.
"It hasn't really sunk in to be honest. I'm absolutely delighted to be here," Williams told the club website.
"I only heard about the interest a couple of days ago and now I'm here, so it's been a bit of a whirlwind."
After beating League One Coventry City 2-1 at the Ricoh Arena, Worcester narrowly failed to make the third round.
After drawing 1-1 at Scunthorpe United, they lost their second round replay at Aggborough on penalties, after an epic, record-breaking, shootout.
