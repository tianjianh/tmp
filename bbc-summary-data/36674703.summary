The 26-year-old follows in the footsteps of compatriot Marcus Willis in meeting the Swiss on Centre Court.
British qualifier Willis, ranked 772 in the world, lost 6-0 6-3 6-4 to Federer on Wednesday.
World number one Serena Williams is second on Centre Court as the defending champion faces fellow American Christina McHale.
In the men's draw, Novak Djokovic will be on Court One as the Serb continues his bid to defend his Wimbledon title against American Sam Querrey.
Evans has enjoyed a remarkable run in the past year, climbing more than 650 places up the world rankings since dropping to 772nd in May 2015.
Questions were raised about the Birmingham player's commitment to the sport when he did not turn up to a Futures event, while he has also struggled with a knee injury.
But he has rediscovered his fitness and form in the past 12 months, helping Great Britain win the Davis Cup and claiming three ATP Challenger titles.
He was rewarded with his first Wimbledon win against Germany's Jan-Lennard Struff, before setting up the meeting with Federer by beating 30th seed Alexandr Dolgopolov on Thursday.
"(Federer's) not a normal guy obviously, but he's another tennis player," said Evans.
"I just have to prepare myself and try and put that to the back of my head - that it's Roger I'm playing - go out and give it my best."
"Dan will go out there and try to make life as difficult as possible for Roger," said British former Wimbledon semi-finalist Tim Henman.
"He needs to serve well, use that good sliced backhand and try and dictate when he gets the chance. Obviously that's not easy against Federer."
Venus Williams makes a swift return to action as the former world number one plays Russian Daria Kasatkina on Court One.
Williams overcame Greek qualifier Maria Sakkari 7-5 4-6 6-3 in the second round on Thursday.
However, the five-times Wimbledon champion appeared to be disappointed at having to play on Court 18 - the smallest show court at the All England Club.
"I think if players have to play outside (on the outside courts), all players should have to play outside," said Williams.
"There shouldn't be exceptions or any inequality to it."
Rain on Wednesday resulted in a hefty backlog of matches, meaning the remaining second-round encounters will be completed on Friday.
Two of the game's entertainers, Nick Kyrgios and Dustin Brown, meet in a battle for a place in the third round.
The pair are close friends, having played together for the Singapore Slammers in last year's International Premier Tennis League.

Also playing their second-round match are Stan Wawrinka and Juan Martin del Potro.
Former US Open champion Del Potro is making his return to Grand Slam action at Wimbledon after battling back from three wrist operations that almost led to him retiring from tennis.
"I was close to quitting at the end of last year but now is completely different," said the Argentine.
"I'm expecting to be better in the future, but for this year my biggest challenge is to finish healthy and make a good preparation for next year."
