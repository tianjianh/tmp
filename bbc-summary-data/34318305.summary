[SN]TITLE[SN]
Lib Dem leader Kirsty Williams promises fresh ideas

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Liberal Democrats can provide "a vision that puts people first" for the 2016 assembly election, the party's Welsh leader has said.

Kirsty Williams castigated the Welsh government as the "same old Labour ministers making the same old decisions".
"Doing things differently to the Tories isn't enough," she told her party's conference in Bournemouth.
"Wales needs fresh ideas, ambition and dynamism."
The Lib Dems are the smallest group in the assembly with five of the 60 seats, but have not ruled out a coalition deal with either Labour or the Conservatives if no party secures a majority in May.
