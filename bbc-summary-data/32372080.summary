[SN]TITLE[SN]
Borussia Dortmund: Thomas Tuchel to replace Jurgen Klopp

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Thomas Tuchel will replace the departing Jurgen Klopp as Borussia Dortmund head coach from 1 July.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Klopp, 47, announced on Wednesday he was leaving Dortmund at the end of the season as he felt he was no longer the right man to take them forward.
Former Mainz coach Tuchel has signed a three-year contract with the eight-times German champions.
Tuchel, 41, stood down from his post at Mainz last year after leading them to their highest Bundesliga finish.
He is regarded as one of Germany's top coaches and was linked with the Hamburg job before Bruno Labbadia was appointed.
Tuchel set a new club record at Mainz by winning their first seven league matches of the 2010-11 season.
Klopp has frequently been linked with Premier League clubs, including Manchester United before the appointment of Louis van Gaal, Arsenal and more recently Manchester City.
