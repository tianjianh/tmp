Former Nottingham Forest boss Billy Davies has withdrawn from talks to be St Mirren's new manager.

The 52-year-old former Buddies midfielder was the bookies' favourite to succeed the sacked Alex Rae.
"I show respect to every club when they approach me," he told BBC Scotland.
"I've met the club officials a few times over the last few weeks and can confirm that, in response to press questions, I will not be taking part in the future of St Mirren Football Club."
Davies, who previously managed Motherwell, Preston North End and Derby County, has been out of management since being sacked by Forest in March 2014.
He met St Mirren chairman Gordon Scott last week to chat about the job.
That followed the exit of former Scotland midfielder Rae after only nine months in charge of the Paisley club.
The Buddies sit bottom of the Scottish Championship without a win in seven league fixtures this season.
