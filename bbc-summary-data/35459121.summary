The historic spot where Robert the Bruce began his bid for the throne of Scotland has been marked in a new Greggs bakery in Dumfries.

Bruce killed John "Red" Comyn, his rival for the crown, on the site of the old Greyfriars Church in 1306.
A local trust had hoped to buy nearby premises to turn into a visitor centre but they were leased to Greggs instead.
MSP Joan McAlpine contacted the firm to explain their historic significance and they have now installed a plaque.
It was designed in collaboration with the Dumfries-based Robert the Bruce Trust and its expert Prof Ted Cowan, emeritus professor of Scottish History at Glasgow University.
Ms McAlpine joined Prof Cowan, Ian and Margo McClumpha of the trust and Greggs staff members and others to unveil the plaque.
"I warmly congratulate Greggs for their response which will give visitors a focus and educate people about the dramatic events that changed the course of history," she said.
"The Bruce Trust approached me with concerns last year when they heard Greggs were taking over the store which sits where Robert the Bruce murdered the Red Comyn.
"They had unsuccessfully tried to buy the building from its owners, a charitable trust who leased it to Greggs. "
She wrote to Greggs chief executive and was "delighted" when they responded "so positively".
"The panels look great and so too do the photographs of local scenes," she said.
Ms McAlpine added that she would continue to support the trust's campaign for a Bruce visitor centre close to the site.
