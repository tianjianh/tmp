Up to 200 fixed term jobs are to go at Ford's engine making factory in Bridgend, the company has confirmed.

The firm said the temporary workers, who were making six-cylinder engines for Volvo, would be released at the end of the contract in April.
It is understood 197 employees are affected, but 60 will be transferred to other lines.
Roger Maddison, of Unite union, said the losses were expected but he was hopeful a new contract would be won.
"There is a lull," he said.
"We are waiting for new product to come in. We are aware of the decision and we're hoping to mitigate the losses."
Mr Maddison said Ford was yet to make a decision on where a new engine will be built.
"The bidding process is still going on for the new dragon engine," he said.
"All the indications are that Bridgend is favourite. It is a global engine and that will secure the future of the plant long term. The decision has been put off for a couple of months."
About 2,200 people work at the plant, which makes petrol engines for Ford, Jaguar Land Rover and up until now Volvo.
