[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A Bristol school is asking pupils and parents whether it should drop the 17th Century slave trader Edward Colston from its name.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Colston's Primary School said it was launching the consultation to "confirm our school's identity".
The move comes after one of the city's  music venues, Colston Hall, announced it would drop the "toxic" name in 2020.
The school aims to announce its decision during its 70th birthday celebrations next year.
In a letter sent to parents, the school asks whether it should "keep its name or has the time come for a change".
"Having undertaken a vision and values project this year and received a formal request for consultation over the school name in May 2017, governors are delighted to be in a position to roll this out now," the school says.
"This is a very important decision for our school, so please do have a careful think about it."
Parents will be able to have their say via on online survey from 3 July to 21 October, while pupils will also be quizzed for their views on 13 July.
