Andy Murray is Australian Open sixth seed, Novak Djokovic No 1

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Britain's Andy Murray, a three-time finalist, will be seeded sixth for the Australian Open, with Serbia's Novak Djokovic the number one seed.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Five-time champion Serena Williams is top seed for the women's event while Britain's Heather Watson will have no protection in Friday's draw.
Former champion Victoria Azarenka, who is ranked 41st in the world after an injury-hit 2014, is also unseeded.
The tournament, the first Grand Slam of the year, begins on Monday.
The seedings mirror the world rankings.
Spain's David Ferrer is the ninth seed in the men's draw after the withdrawal of US Open champion Marin Cilic, while world number 12 Jo-Wilfried Tsonga's absence with a forearm strain means Ernests Gulbis moves up to 11th seed.
Britons Kyle Edmund and Liam Broady are two matches away from reaching the main draw after wins in the first round of qualification.
