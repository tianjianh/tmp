The victory was United's third in a row, cutting the gap to National League safety to five points.
"Bliss was an animal today," Nicholson told BBC Radio Devon.
"He got a bit of luck for his second goal, but if you throw yourself in there like he's done, those are the bits of luck that you get."
Blissett's work rate also impressed Nicholson, whose side have not been beaten since the end of January.
"With his first goal, he's chased down something, he's bullied the goalkeeper and he's got his reward," added Nicholson of the former Bristol Rovers striker, who joined the club on a free transfer in January.
"He's gone from his first couple of games where he's finding his feet, to all of a sudden looking like the real deal."
