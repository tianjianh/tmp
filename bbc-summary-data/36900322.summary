The 19-year-old winger, who can play on the left or right, made his only appearance for Liverpool in the FA Cup third round against Exeter in January.
Kent spent part of last season on loan at League One club Coventry City.
"He is fearless, loves to take on his man and get balls into the box," Barnsley boss Paul Heckingbottom said.
"Not only that, he can finish. He's one of the most highly rated youngsters in the country and now he has a great opportunity to step up and show us what he can do in the Championship," he told the club website.
