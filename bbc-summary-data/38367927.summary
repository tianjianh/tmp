Manager Steve McClaren believes bad decisions from the officials cost Derby County as their seven-match winning streak ended with a 2-2 draw at Fulham.

Derby are now seventh in the Championship table, only a point outside the play-off places.
McClaren told BBC Radio Derby: "I thought we were fantastic first half, controlled the game, the gameplan was excellent and we executed it well.
"But I think, in the end, some bad decisions have really cost us."
The former England boss felt particularly aggrieved by the Rams not being allowed an advantage by referee Andy Woolmer late in the game.
"I thought that was the worst decision I have seen in a long, long time," continued McClaren.
"He accepted that and he said he blew up too soon. It could've been a two-on-one situation and we could've come away with the points.
"But, I think it was such a good game that I think a draw was a fair result.
"I am pleased for the fans. We have 3,000 here and it is a long journey. They really got behind the boys."
