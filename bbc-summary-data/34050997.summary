Chris Read: Notts wicketkeeper eyes 1,000 dismissals milestone

Nottinghamshire captain Chris Read is preparing to become the first wicketkeeper in more than a decade to claim 1,000 first-class dismissals.

The 37-year-old's five catches in Nottinghamshire's Championship win over Warwickshire took him to 998.
When Read reaches the target, he will be the first player to do so since Jack Russell in 1997.
"It's close isn't it? I am maybe thinking about it more now and willing people to find the edge," Read said.
"I probably won't do a lot. I will probably throw the ball up a little bit higher than I might normally do," he told BBC Radio Nottingham.
"But, at the same time, I am so excited by this group of bowlers. The way Jake Ball bowled against Warwickshire was brilliant.
"If he keeps that up I am sure there will be more edges coming my way."
Read's chance to become the 26th player in history to reach 1,000 dismissals will come when Notts start a Championship game against Durham at Trent Bridge on 9 September.
The former England keeper, who missed part of the season with a hamstring injury, is currently leading Nottinghamshire's batting averages, with 762 runs in 16 innings at an average of 63.50.
And he reached a milestone with the bat this week, when his 69 against Warwickshire saw him pass 15,000 first-class runs.
Read, who has three centuries this season, added: "I didn't feel it was a big thing but everyone was 'yeah, that's a lot of runs'.
"For me, we talk about landmarks, but that wasn't one I was eyeing up at all.
"I am in really good form at the moment and I have always said that when you are in form, you need to make it pay.
"There are times in your career when you have lows, you don't know where your next run is coming from, so you really need to make those times count."
