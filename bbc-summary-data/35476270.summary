US election 2016: White House race moves to New Hampshire

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Republicans and Democrats vying for their party's ticket for November's US presidential election have been arriving in New Hampshire ahead of the next vote.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Monday's caucuses in Iowa were won by Senator Ted Cruz for the Republicans and Hillary Clinton for the Democrats.
Mr Cruz prevailed despite trailing in opinion polls while Mrs Clinton beat Senator Bernie Sanders by just 0.2%.
New Hampshire is seen as a quite different challenge for the parties.
The state's more moderate and less religious electorate may prove a tougher nut for Mr Cruz to crack in the primaries it is due to hold on 9 February.
Donald Trump, long the frontrunner in the Republican contest, is expected to do much better than in Iowa, which held the nation's first vote.
On the Democrat side, Mr Sanders is seen as having a home advantage in New Hampshire over Mrs Clinton, being a senator of the neighbouring state of Vermont.
The state-by-state voting will culminate in conventions in July, at which the two parties will confirm their choice of candidate to succeed Barack Obama, the Democratic president who is standing down after two terms in office.
Even before Mrs Clinton's narrow victory was announced officially, Mr Sanders was up at 05:00 (10:00 GMT) and aboard a flatbed lorry, being greeted by supporters in the New Hampshire town of Bow.
Telling the crowd that his campaign had "astounded the world" in Iowa, he promised it would "astound the world again" in New Hampshire.
Mrs Clinton is due to address a crowd at a sports stadium in Nashua.

US election: Iowa results map
Final results show Mrs Clinton took 49.8% in Iowa to Mr Sanders' 49.6%.
Senator Cruz took 26% of the Republican vote to 23% for Donald Trump, but Senator Marco Rubio finished a surprisingly strong third, just slightly behind.
Mr Cruz declared his win a "victory for courageous conservatives".
Many mainstream Republicans favour Mr Rubio, fearful that Mr Cruz and Mr Trump may alienate voters with their combative style.
