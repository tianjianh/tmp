A £38m flood defence scheme for Carlisle has been completed months ahead of schedule.

Three people died in January 2005 when 175mm of rain fell in just 36 hours, causing £250m of damage.
The flood alleviation scheme will protect about 3,000 homes and businesses around the city.
It includes miles of raised defences, two new pumping stations, 30 flood gates, two raised footbridges and seven CCTV cameras.
It is the result of close partnership work between the Environment Agency, Carlisle City Council, Cumbria County Council, United Utilities and local businesses.
Glyn Vaughan, from the Environment Agency, said: "We are extremely pleased to have delivered this major project for the people of Carlisle.
"Originally, the scheme was due to be finished in March 2011 but thanks to the tremendous support of everyone involved, we have managed to complete it almost a year ahead of schedule."
