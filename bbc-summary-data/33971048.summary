Thirty-two jobs are being lost at quarrying and construction contractor P Clarke and Sons in Lisnaskea, County Fermanagh.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The company recently transferred its business to FP MCCann.
Gareth Scott, of the Unite union, said: "A week ago, Unite warned that at least 20 jobs were likely to be lost.
"Unfortunately, we have been shocked at the scale of the impact on workers which is even greater than we initially feared."
Of the 32 redundancies, eight are voluntary.
The administrator said that the 32 workers had been made redundant prior to his appointment.
Fifty-eight staff have now transferred to FP McCann which is based in Magherafelt.
