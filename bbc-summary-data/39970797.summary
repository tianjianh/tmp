[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Relegated Swindon Town have offered five players new deals ahead of the 2017-18 season, including captain Nathan Thompson and Iraq's Yaser Kasim.

Raphael Rossi-Branco, Jermaine Hylton and Jon Obika have also been offered contracts by the Wiltshire outfit.
But midfielder Anton Rodgers is to leave the managerless side when his contract expires this summer.
Swindon previously let a further four players go and then parted company with head coach Luke Williams on 5 May.
They will spend next season in League Two after finishing 22nd in the third tier.
