France's Aurelie Muller had won silver but was disqualified at the finish line on Rio's Copacabana Beach.
A replay showed the world champion forcibly holding Italy's Rachele Bruni down with her right arm while trying to touch the finishing board.
Brazil's Poliana Okimoto was upgraded to a bronze medal, with Payne seventh.
Van Rouwendaal, 22, broke away shortly after the halfway mark and led for the remainder, finishing in one hour 56 minutes 32 seconds.
Payne, who finished in 1:57:23, said: "I was hoping for rough, choppy conditions, but it was the perfect race for pool swimmers which I think is why you saw Sharon become the Olympic champion.
"I won't be dramatic so I won't hang up my goggles just yet, but I am taking a break - I need to catch up with family and friends and have some time for my business."
