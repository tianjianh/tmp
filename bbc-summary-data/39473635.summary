Manager Dean Keates admits Wrexham will find it hard to compete against clubs with bigger budgets when recruiting new players this summer.

Keates has already made changes to the National League club's squad since succeeding Gary Mills in October 2016.
The 38-year-old believes Wrexham can attract players but says the financial clout of rival clubs will make it harder for them.
"You're going to be competing and we can't match them money wise," he said.
"If we're up against Tranmere or Forest Green it might come down to finances with players - that's the be all and end all.
"But we have a big football club with passionate support. We can encourage players to come here by the fact we can offer an unbelievable stadium to play in."
Wrexham were beaten 1-0 by promotion chasing Tranmere Rovers in the National League on Saturday and are 10th in the table.
Tranmere raised Â£30,000 through crowdfunding in February to generate funds for new signings to boost their hopes of a return to the English Football League.
Wrexham launched a 'Build the Budget' fund earlier this year which has been set up to assist Keates with his budget for next season.
"There's some big budgets and that's one of the big budgets," Keates said of Tranmere.
"They pay a lot of money and for their changes they had two strikers off and two strikers on.
"The size of this football club it shouldn't be sat in mid table. I know what the expectations are and what the fans want."
