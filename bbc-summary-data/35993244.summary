Lincolnshire PCC 2016 election: Conservative Marc Jones elected as police and crime commissioner

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Conservative Marc Jones has been elected as Lincolnshire's next police and crime commissioner.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Mr Jones was appointed after "second choice" votes were taken into consideration.
Neither him nor UKIP's candidate, Victoria Ayling, gained the required 50% of the vote to win outright in the first round of counts.
The ex-Deputy Leader of Lincoln Council said he was "very pleased" to have been elected.

Mr Jones, who was elected after gaining 48,033 votes in the the second round, said his biggest challenge would be to fully understand the different aspects of the role.
He said: "There's certain information as a candidate you're not privy to, so it will be a huge learning curve to fully understand what needs to be done.
"With regard to funding, I've already had meetings with the Home Office and the Prime Minister to make sure I get a fair formula for Lincolnshire."
Ms Ayling polled 37,420 in the second round of voting.
Turnout in the election was higher than that of 2012 when Alan Hardwick was voted in with the figure at 21.19%, compared to 15% four years ago.
