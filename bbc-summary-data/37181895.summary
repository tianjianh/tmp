Women's Super League One: Reading Women 0-1 Liverpool Ladies

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Katie Zelem's late goal gave Liverpool Ladies victory over a Reading side still waiting for their first Women's Super League One win of the season.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Liverpool's Laura Coombs hit the home crossbar in a goalless first half.
In the second period, Royals forward Melissa Fletcher hit the post before Lauren Bruton had a penalty saved by Reds keeper Siobhan Chamberlain.
With five minutes remaining, substitute Zelem headed home as the Royals dropped to second from bottom.
Reading goalkeeper Mary Earps:
"I felt like we were on top of the game.
"It's so disappointing to lose a goal so late on, especially one that we could have defended better, but we're going to have to pick ourselves up and go again against Chelsea.
"It didn't come off tonight, it's gutting all round. It was a good performance and not one we deserved to come away with nothing from."
Liverpool captain Gemma Bonner:
"I think we did deserve it.
"Reading had a good game plan to frustrate us, they defended in a block, fair play and credit to them, they did it well.
"I think for us we created chance after chance and it was only a matter of time, it doesn't matter how it goes in, it's an important three points for us."
