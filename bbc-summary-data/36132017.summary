The 43-year-old, who is currently General Manager High Performance of South African rugby, will start in the new post in July on a three-year deal.
Erasmus will work alongside head coach Anthony Foley at Thomond Park.
"It's a challenge I humbly accept but with a clear desire to use all my past experience to make Munster  one of the top rugby clubs in Europe," he said.
Munster have struggled this season, exiting the European Champions Cup at the group stage and lying a lowly seventh in the Pro12.
Erasmus played for Free State Cheetahs and the Golden Lions in the Currie Cup, and for the Cats and Stormers in the Super 12.
He won 36 caps with the Springboks and after retiring moved into coaching, guiding the Cheetahs to Currie Cup glory in 2005.
The following year, his Cheetahs side shared the Currie Cup trophy with the Blue Bulls.
In 2007, the Eastern Cape native served as technical adviser for South Africa during their Rugby World Cup winning campaign in France before becoming Head Coach of the Stormers and Director of Coaching at Western Province.
Erasmus served a second term as technical adviser to the Springboks during the 2011 Rugby World Cup in New Zealand before assuming the General Manager High Performance role.
