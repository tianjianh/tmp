Holyrood 2016: Parties focus on climate and land

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Scottish parties are set to campaign on issues of climate change and the environment, as the race for Holyrood continues.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The SNP have set out plans for tougher targets on climate change.
Labour is calling for a ban on fracking, while the Tories want to give councils the power to bring in moratoriums on wind farms and fracking.
The Lib Dems say they want to plug the "black hole" in Scotland's rural economy.
SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon has pledged to raise Scotland's 2020 climate change target to a 50% cut in greenhouse gas emissions.
The new target would be contained in a Climate Change Bill if the party is returned to government at the 5 May election.
The Scottish government has missed its interim emissions targets for the last four years.
The SNP's Aileen McLeod, said: "It has not always been easy but Scotland has been a genuine world leader in the area of climate change and green energy, and the latest evidence shows that we are on track to exceed our 42% target."
Scottish Labour leader Kezia Dugdale will outline a Labour plan for a greener Scotland, including:
Labour said climate change was the great challenge for this generation.
Ms Dugdale said: "The next Scottish government needs to offer more than warm words - it needs to deliver real change.
"The SNP's approach to climate change is similar to its whole approach to government - set a target, miss it and then set an even tougher target in the hope nobody notices."
Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson told the BBC her party would give local authorities the power to enforce a moratorium on wind farms and fracking.
Ms Davidson has also accused the SNP "burying bad news" at election time to avoid fresh questions over its house buying tax.
She said that unlike in 11 previous months, the Scottish government has failed to produce new figures at the end of last month on the sums collected by Land and Buildings Transaction Tax.
Meanwhile, Scottish Liberal Democrats leader Willie Rennie will put pressure on the Scottish government to "plug the black hole in Scotland's rural economy", as he visits a Cupar farm.
Speaking ahead of the visit, Mr Rennie said: "The SNP has failed spectacularly to support people living and working in Scotland's rural and remote areas.
"That's why Liberal Democrats in our manifesto have set out plans for immediate restitution payments for farmers who have lost out.
"They cannot be expected to pay for the SNP's shambolic handling of CAP payments."
