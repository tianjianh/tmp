It happened at a yard at Humbie Holdings, near Kirknewton at about 17:40 on Wednesday. The 27-year-old truck driver died at the scene.
The emergency services attended the incident and Scottish Power engineers isolated the power supply.
It is understood the tipper bed was up when it collided with the high-voltage overhead cable.
The driver is believed to have been initially unhurt but was killed when trying to leave the vehicle's cab while the tipper was still in contact with the cable.
Police Scotland and the Health and Safety Executive are investigating.
A Police Scotland spokesman said: "Officers and the Scottish Ambulance Services attended however, despite best efforts of paramedics, the man was pronounced dead at the scene.
"There are no suspicious circumstances and a report will be sent to the Procurator Fiscal."
