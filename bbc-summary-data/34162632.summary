Scotland v Germany: Mats Hummels wary of Scots threat

Germany's World Cup-winning defender Mats Hummels believes Scotland remain dangerous opponents despite their defeat in Georgia.

Hummels and his side dethroned Poland at the top of Group D on Friday after a 3-1 win over their neighbours.
The Germans, with three games remaining, are confident of a win in Monday's qualifier at Hampden.
"I think if we play that style without mistakes we have a good chance to win this game," Hummels told BBC Scotland.
"I hope it will be a great game and of course we want to win and we have to win."
Scotland's failure to pick up any points in Tbilisi makes victory over the Germans a necessity if they are to retain any hope of automatic qualification.
But Hummels feels the Scots were always likely to pose his side problems.
"They are dangerous and it doesn't depend on how they played the last game," the Borussia Dortmund centre-back said.
"We know they have a good team, a strong team and some good individual players and of course a very passionate stadium.
"It will be a tough game if we let them play, if we let them have chances, the crowd will get enthusiastic and the team will always be better then."
Hummels and his team-mates are a formidable unit, though, unlikely to be remotely intimidated by even the most raucous Hampden crowd.
On Friday in Frankfurt, at times they looked close to the form that brought them glory in Brazil 14 months ago.
"We're not back to our best but I think we had a good performance except for the last 10 or 15 minutes before half-time," Hummels continued.
"Then we had some mistakes, some passes to the opponent to make it really easy for them to create chances.
"So that was a point we wanted to improve in the second half and I think we did - I think we controlled the game."
