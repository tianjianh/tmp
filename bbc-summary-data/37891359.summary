The seven-year-old was found with a broken foreleg while out grazing at Irish trainer Willie Mullins' yard.
"He goes out there every day and it's just a freak accident - it's tough to take," said Mullins.
Vautour won 10 of his 16 starts overall and finished second in his last race at the Boylesports Champion Chase at Punchestown in April.
