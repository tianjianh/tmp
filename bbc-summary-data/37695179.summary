Kosovo & Croatia face Fifa hearings over anti-Serbian chanting

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Croatia and Kosovo both face Fifa disciplinary hearings over anti-Serbian chanting by fans during their 2018 World Cup qualifier on 6 October.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The tie was Kosovo's first home fixture but, because of a lack of facilities in the country, was played in neighbouring Albania, where Croatia won 6-0.
Kosovo's membership of Fifa was opposed by Serbia, from which it declared independence in 2008.
World governing body Fifa has not said when the hearings will take place.
Earlier this year, Fifa ordered Croatia to play two World Cup qualifying games behind closed doors because of "discriminatory chants" during friendly matches against Israel and Hungary.
The first game of that punishment was against Turkey in September and the second will be when they host Iceland in November.
