[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Scottish Land Fund cash will be used by Copperworks Housing Association to develop an open space, known as the "triangle site" in Royston.
The association plans to convert the land at Millburn Street into community green space areas for leisure, recreation and wellbeing.
They also want to purchase a smaller site opposite the Millburn Centre.
CHA director Fiona Murphy said: "Copperworks Housing Association is absolutely delighted to have been awarded funding to purchase this site which has been a blight on our community for many years now.
"It is fantastic that we can bring this land back into local ownership and we are excited at the prospect of future regeneration, in consultation with local people."
John Watt, of the Scottish Land Fund Committee, said: "This project, based in the heart of Royston, has the potential to transform two neglected pieces of land into spaces that local people can be proud of.
"By owning the land, they will have more control over their own futures and will have a greater say on how these areas are developed for community use."
The project is one of 11 across Scotland sharing in about £2.1m of Scottish Land Fund money.
