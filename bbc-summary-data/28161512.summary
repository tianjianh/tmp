League Two side AFC Wimbledon have signed former Arsenal goalkeeper James Shea on a free transfer.

Shea came through the north London club's academy, but left the Gunners last summer after failing to make a senior appearance.
The 23-year-old, who had a loan spell at Dagenham in 2011, spent last season with Ryman League Premier Division side Harrow Borough.
The Dons have not disclosed the length of Shea's contract.
"James has been brought in to compete with Ross Worner for the number one jersey," Dons boss Neal Ardley told the club website.
"We had him in for training three or four times last season. He played in a behind closed doors match for us and really impressed.
"James won the Player of the Year award last season at Harrow and four or five clubs tried to get him in on trial."
Meanwhile, Wimbledon have also signed Basingstoke Town's 20-year-old keeper Joe McDonnell, who will join the club's development squad.
