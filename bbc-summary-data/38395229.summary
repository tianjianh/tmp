Members of the Holyrood's justice committee are scrutinising the Railway Police (Scotland) Bill following concerns about the proposed change.
They have already heard from police bosses who said a merger would be "complicated but not insurmountable".
It has been a long held aim of the government to see through the change.
The legislation would give power over railway policing to Police Scotland and the Scottish Police Authority (SPA) watchdog.
British Transport Police's deputy chief constable, Adrian Hancock, told the justice committee last month that the plans could create an unnecessary "border" for officers.
MSPs also heard concerns that officers would leave due to uncertainty over terms and conditions and pensions.
Ministers have since pledged that employees' jobs, pay and pensions will all be protected under a "triple lock guarantee" during the process of integration.
The committee wants to hear views on;
Convener Margaret Mitchell MSP said: "Now the government's plans have been set out, it is important that anyone with an interest in the future of transport policing in Scotland tells us what they think of this fundamental change to policing in Scotland.
"The concerns and evidence raised from these responses will be used to better inform the forthcoming debate and to hold any government actions to account."
