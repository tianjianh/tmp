[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Leaders Livingston were stunned at home by Peterhead in Scottish League One, with the visitors holding out for a 2-1 win to end a three-match winning run.

David Hopkin's men remain top, though, with Brechin's game at Albion postponed and Alloa losing to Airdrieonians 2-1.
Elsewhere, Ross Millen's second-half penalty earned Queen's Park a 2-1 win at East Fife.
That leaves East Fife in ninth after Stranraer leapfrogged them with a 3-1 win against bottom side Stenhousemuir.
Leighton McIntosh gave Peterhead a first-half lead at the Tony Macaroni Arena lead before Scott Brown doubled the advantage with 16 minutes left.
Liam Buchanan headed home to set up a grandstand final 10 minutes, but Peterhead held firm.
Airdrie took advantage of Jim Goodwin's horror show to record a fifth win in a row.
The player-manager scored an own goal after 30 minutes before receiving his second booking eight minutes into the second half.
By then, Andy Ryan's 10th of the season had made it 2-0, though the 10 men pulled one back through Scott Taggart with 13 minutes left.
That result moved Airdrie up to second, a point behind Livingston, with Brechin and Alloa both within three points of the top.
Adam Cummins had given Queen's Park a 22nd-minute lead at East Fife before Jamie Insall levelled just before half-time. Millen's penalty in the second half earned the Spiders the three points.
Steven Bell's 36th-minute opener for Stranraer was cancelled out by Stenhousemuir's Alistair Roy in first-half stoppage time, but Ryan Thomson and Joe Nutall scored in the second period to secure a home win.
