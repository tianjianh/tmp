Kyle Lafferty: Norwich City striker fined £23,000 for betting offence

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Norwich City striker Kyle Lafferty has been fined £23,000 and warned as to his future conduct after accepting a Football Association betting charge.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Northern Ireland international, 28, was charged on 29 July with breaching FA rule E8, which bars professional players from betting on football-related matters.
The offence took place on 20 February.
Lafferty made one league appearance for Norwich last season, and played six times for Birmingham City on loan.
He was an unused substitute as Norwich started their Championship season with a 4-1 win over Blackburn on Saturday.
Rule E8 prevents professional players not only from betting on matches in which they are involved or have an influence, but also on any other football-related matter anywhere in the world - including matches, the transfer of players, employment of managers, team selection or disciplinary matters.
