Councils call for taskforce to address teacher shortage

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The leaders of seven councils have called for a national taskforce to be set up to help deal with teacher recruitment problems.

They made the call at a summit on tackling teacher shortages in northern and rural parts of Scotland.
In some areas, scores of posts are unfilled and adverts have been failing to attract suitable candidates.
Education Secretary Angela Constance addressed the conference, which was hosted by Aberdeen City Council.
She was asked to consider three "key priorities":
Aberdeen City Council leader Jenny Laing said they discussed their concerns about continuing to raise attainment while facing problems recruiting teachers.
Pupil numbers have increased but there has been "unprecedented low numbers" of applicants for teaching jobs, she added.
"We have made a huge effort to fill our teacher vacancies so we would ask that this is recognised and that going forward we can have a flexible and innovative approach to resolve the issues which if not addressed could have a major impact upon the education of many thousands of our children," she said.
The event had the backing of Aberdeenshire, Moray, Highland, Western Isles, Orkney Islands and Shetland Islands councils.
Ahead of the summit, Ms Constance told BBC Radio Scotland's Good Morning Scotland programme that the Scottish government had increased the number of university places available for the fourth consecutive year as part of a bid to tackle the problem.
She said: "That's an increase of more than 1,100 places and that is targeted at the areas most in need.
"So we will target places at the University of Aberdeen and the University of the Highlands and Islands."
The challenges facing some councils in the north of Scotland recruiting teachers touch on several issues.
One is a challenge faced by many employers in rural and remote areas - finding suitably-qualified applicants for skilled, professional jobs.
The bulk of people from rural areas who become teachers leave home aged around 18 to begin their studies. Inevitably many might not want to return, at least while they are in their 20s.
The problem here is age-old. Some call it rural depopulation, others the brain drain.

Ms Constance added: "The Scottish government has funded the University of Aberdeen in terms of a part-time distance learning post graduate diploma in education.
"That has enabled local authorities to develop the skills of their existing staff, for example classroom assistants, and enabled people to both study and work.
"And the distance learning initial teacher education programme has resulted in additional primary school teachers this year of 19 and in 2016 an addition of 15."
Seven directors of education attended the summit, along with officials from the Scottish government and the General Teaching Council for Scotland (GTCS).
The aim was to understand the root causes of teacher shortages and identify solutions at a national and local level.
When details of the summit were announced last month councils said the challenge had been recruiting and retaining "sufficient numbers of high-quality teachers to provide the best possible education" for pupils.
Councils have already tried individual initiatives to ease the problem.
In 2013, Aberdeenshire Council sent staff to Canada and Ireland to try to recruit new teachers.
Last year, Aberdeen City Council offered to pay the tuition fees of staff who want to become primary school teachers in a bid to tackle the shortage.
And in August, the first teachers took advantage of an offer of free accommodation for six months to teach in Moray.
Last week the Scottish government launched its #inspiringteachers campaign at the Scottish Learning Festival in Glasgow.
It aims to attract more young people into teacher training with a focus on science, technology, engineering and maths.
