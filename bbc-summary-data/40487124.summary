[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Jones, 30, played for the Magpies during a loan spell in 2009 and returns to Meadow Lane after spending the past three seasons with the Spireites.
He told the club website: "With the plans the manager and the chairman have, the facilities and the stadium it seems like a club built for success."
Boss Kevin Nolan said Jones was a "quality signing".
"He has great ability on the ball and a lovely left foot," Nolan added. "He is a real up-and-downer and hopefully we will see the best of him throughout the year."
The Magpies have not disclosed the length of Jones' contract.
