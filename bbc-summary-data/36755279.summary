The hosts led 1-9 to 1-6 at half-time with Mickey Quinn netting early for Longford before a Colin Walshe goal.
The Leinster side fought back and they led by point when Robbie Smyth scored the decisive goal on 62 minutes.
A stunned Monaghan could only respond with a Conor McManus point in added time as their season came to an end.
The reigning Ulster champions fell 1-1 to 0-0 behind after four minutes as Longford stormed out of the blocks.
Quinn netted on the rebound for the opening goal on four minutes after Liam Connerton's shot was partially saved by Rory Beggan.
Home captain McManus opened Monaghan's account with a pointed free followed by a brilliant score from play to make it 1-1 to 0-2 after five minutes.
Longford had a fruitful spell after McManus' points as James McGivney grabbed two points before Brian Kavanagh pointed a free, giving the visitors a 1-4 to 0-2 lead after 15 minutes.
Jack McCarron replied for the hosts with a well-taken point before Smyth produced a wonderful individual score on 23 minutes.
Conor McCarthy scored his first point of the game on 24 minutes before Smyth replied with a free for Longford.
This proved to be the visitors' last point of the half as Monaghan scored an unanswered 1-5 before half time.
McCarthy scored a point either side of a McCarron effort before Walshe notched a goal for Malachy O'Rourke's men.
The corner-back burst forward from defence before laying the ball off to McCarron - the Currin clubman's shot was saved by Paddy Collum but Walshe was in the right place to drive home the rebound in the 34th minute.
And Monaghan rounded off the first half with a further two points. McManus pointed a free before a good score from Ryan McAnespie rounded off the half for the home side to give them a three-point lead going into the interval.
Longford had the wind at their backs after half-time and needed a good start to the half to keep in touch with Monaghan.
Diarmuid Masterson grabbed a score after only ten seconds before Kavanagh pointed a sideline ball to bring Longford within a point of the hosts with just two minutes played in the second half.
Rory Beggan scored a long range free for Monaghan in the 40th minute but Longford kept the scoreboard ticking over and were soon level.
Masterson scored his second point before another effort from McGivney made it 1-10 apiece on 44 minutes.
Two points in the space of a minute for Longford saw them edge two in front - Kavanagh and Connerton providing the scores.
But Monaghan came roaring back with two points of their own. McCarthy and substitute Shane Carey levelled proceedings in the 58th minute to set up a close finish to the contest.
Masterson edged Longford in front again on 59 minutes before Smyth's goal put the pressure on Monaghan, who could only close the gap to three points.
