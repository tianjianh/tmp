[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
British javelin record holder Goldie Sayers says she has considered not competing at August's Rio Olympics if Russia are allowed to take part.

Russian athletes are currently banned from international competition after allegations of state-organised doping.
Russian sports minister Vitaly Mutko says the ban should be lifted but Sayers thinks it should remain.
"I'd almost go as far as to say I wouldn't want to compete in Rio if Russia were competing," she added.
"But if they are reinstated and I didn't compete I'd be cheating myself out of another opportunity at the Olympics."

Sayers finished fourth at the 2008 Games in Beijing but could be upgraded to bronze after the International Olympic Committee (IOC) decided to re-test hundreds of samples.
Following those re-tests, Maria Abakumova, who won javelin silver eight years ago, was named as one of 14 Russian athletes to have tested positive.
Russian high jumper Anna Chicherova, who won bronze in Beijing, has also been named by Russian television but has vowed to clear her name.
Up to 31 athletes from six sports could be banned from competing at the Rio Games following the retesting of 454 selected doping samples from the 2008 Games.
The IOC said it would not be revealing the names of athletes who had returned positive results until B samples had been tested and individuals informed.
Sayers said she would be "happy" to received a retrospective bronze medal but also "immensely angry" at missing out on a place on the podium eight years ago.
"I think my career would have taken a totally different trajectory, no doubt," she told BBC Radio 5 live. "It's not the same if you receive a medal through the post."
