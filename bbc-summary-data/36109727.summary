Juventus are one game away from a fifth consecutive Serie A title, thanks to a dramatic victory over Fiorentina.

If second-placed Napoli fail to win away to Roma on Monday (14:00 BST), Juventus will be champions again.
Mario Mandzukic converted Paul Pogba's knockdown for the opener but Nikola Kalinic levelled from 20 yards late on.
Alvaro Morata scored the winner moments later before Kalinic had a penalty saved by Gianluigi Buffon and then struck the bar in a thrilling finish.
Juventus have won 24 of their last 25 league games, drawing the other, since late October to climb from 12th place - and 11 points off the top - to the brink of the Scudetto.
Fifth-placed Fiorentina played well and were unlucky to lose, with Federico Bernardeschi having a goal harshly ruled out for offside in the first half.
They were, however, fortunate to win a penalty in the final minute, when Kalinic went down under minimal contact from ex-Fiorentina winger Juan Cuadrado, who had just come off the bench.
But justice was served when Juve legend Buffon guessed right to save the penalty - and then kept out the rebound from Bernardeschi.
Deep into injury time, ex-Blackburn striker Kalinic had another chance to level but his header from close range hit the crossbar.
Juventus coach Massimiliano Allegri: "Everyone said we were dead and buried. We've bounced back with 24 wins from 25 games.
"We've had a memorable season and now we must round it off in the best possible way.
"Will we watch Roma v Napoli? We'll train and get ready for Carpi [next Sunday], then we'll hear the result."
