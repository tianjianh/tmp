Louis Almond gave the hosts an early lead from the penalty spot after keeper Dean Snedker brought down Mike Phenix before James McQuilkin's equaliser.
Elton Ngwatala put Harriers ahead at the break, going back in front through Tyrone Williams after Phenix levelled.
Evan Garnett made it 4-2 to Harriers but Jack Ryan pulled a late goal back.
Much-improved Harriers completed their campaign in 23rd place, having reached the 40-point mark, nine adrift of safety, after losing just once in their last nine matches.
Harriers boss Colin Gordon told BBC Hereford & Worcester:
"It was great to sign off with a win. It keeps that momentum going. We thoroughly entertained. I was very, very pleased.
"It was a ridiculous start to the game, but it wouldn't be Kidderminster Harriers if we didn't make it difficult for ourselves.
"It was a very difficult surface. Probably the worst we've played on. But we managed to still pass the ball, move the ball and create chances."
