Premiership semi-finalists Wasps have signed two young forwards to bolster their first-team squad for next season.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Bath hooker Tom Woolstencroft is joined by lock Marcus Garratt, also 21, who arrives from Championship side Cornish Pirates, having previously played alongside him on loan at The Rec.
Woolstencroft began his career in the back row before joining Bath's academy.
He was then advised to switch to hooker by former England international lock forward Danny Grewcock.
After representing England at Under-16 and Under-18 level, he was part of the Under-20s side, which also contained new Bath signing Jack Walker, that won the Junior World Championship in 2014.
He made his Bath senior debut in an LV= Cup tie against London Welsh in November 2014, when he was in the same team as the on-loan Garratt.
Former Exeter Chiefs academy player Garratt has spent two seasons with Pirates, who he joined in 2014 from Exmouth.
The 6ft 5ins Devonian made 20 senior appearances for Pirates last season.
