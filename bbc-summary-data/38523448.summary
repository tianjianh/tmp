Irish Cup: Glentoran play Linfield in tie of the fifth round

Gary Haveron believes his Glentoran side are in the right kind of form to topple cross-city rivals Linfield in Saturday's stand-out Irish Cup match.

The big Belfast clubs, who between them have won the cup 64 times, go into the tie on the back of contrasting results.
Glentoran, eighth in the table, hammered Portadown 5-0 while second-placed Linfield lost to Coleraine.
"Saturday is going to be blood and thunder and after Tuesday's win I just can't wait for it," said Haveron.
"If we give anything like we did in the win at Portadown we will not be far away, I can tell you that.
"The win is good for confidence because you walk into the dressing room and everybody is buzzing.
"That is the way you want it to be, a vibrant dressing room which everyone wants to be a part of."
Haveron was appointed Glentoran manager just over three months ago, succeeding Alan Kernaghan, when the east Belfast side were two from bottom in the Irish Premiership.
Under the former Carrick Rangers boss, the Glens have amassed 21 points from 15 matches, and Haveron expects them to continue climbing the table.
"Against Portadown, we could have scored every time we went forward, but it was one performance and we are not going to get too carried away with it because we have stuttered and stumbled over the last lot of weeks," he added.
"We have drawn games we should have won and dropped points we shouldn't have.
"It is going to take a bit of time and some rebuilding, but there is so much potential at this club to really kick on and be competitive on a regular basis with the likes of Crusaders and these other teams."
The pressure on Linfield has been turned up a notch following Tuesday's home defeat by Coleraine which saw them slip seven points behind Premiership leaders Crusaders.
The Blues were runners-up in three competitions last season, leaving former Northern Ireland striker David Healy still waiting to celebrate his first trophy as manager of Linfield.
They will be  without central defender Jimmy Callacher, a former Glentoran player, for Saturday's crunch cup match as he serves an automatic one-match ban for his dismissal in the Coleraine defeat.
