They were shot dead after the attackers crossed into Iran's Sistan Baluchistan province, according to reports.
The gunmen then fled back across the border, Iranian official said. The identity of the attackers is not known.
Sistan Baluchistan has seen frequent clashes in recent years between Iranian security forces and drug smugglers and Sunni rebel groups.
The deputy governor of the province, Ali Asghar Mirshekari, said "armed terrorists" had infiltrated Iran and killed the border guards on Monday,  Iran's official Irna news agency reported. Mr Mirshekari said they had used rocket-propelled grenades as well as guns.
He called on Pakistan to arrest the attackers and hand them over,
It is the deadliest attack in the province since October 2013, when 14 border guards were killed in an attack claimed by Sunni militant group Jaish Al-Adl (Army of Justice).
