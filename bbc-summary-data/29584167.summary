Corey Robinson, 18, from Neath, died at the scene at Llandarcy in May. Two passengers were injured.
The Crown Prosecution Service has decided no charges will be brought.
Mr Robinson was driving a white 63-registered Vauxhall Corsa which collided with the nearside barrier.
His family issued a statement via police at the time saying they felt as though their hearts had been "ripped out".
A former pupil of Dwr-y-Felin Comprehensive, Mr Robinson was a construction engineer and a keen sportsman.
