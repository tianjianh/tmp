A mystery buyer has bought a private beach in Newport at auction for three times its guide price.

The three-mile (4.8km) stretch of shoreline neighbouring Peterstone Wentlooge was sold for Â£61,000.
Auctioneer Keri Harding-Jones said the sale was "extremely rare" as more than half of the UK's shoreline belongs to the Crown Estate.
Paul Fosh Auctions said the beach could only be used at low tide before the sea comes in from the Bristol Channel.
Roger Thomas, from Cooke and Arkwright Estate Agents, who purchased the land on behalf of the mystery buyer said: "I can't reveal who the new owner is but what I can say is there will be a continuation of the current use for sporting and conservation activities on the land."
He added: "There were about six individual bidders active in the room on the night including on the phone."
