Lianne La Havas: How I write songs

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Is Your Love Big Enough?, released in 2012, introduced the world to the song writing and  singing talent of Lianne La Havas.

Nominated for both the Mercury Prize and the Ivor Novello awards, it was also named iTunes' UK album of the year.
Now, ahead of her second album Blood, which tackles themes of family and identity, La Havas talks about how she started writing songs and where she finds inspiration.
I wrote my first actual song when I was 11, it was called Little Things. It was about loving your family or something. The need to do it, at the time, was greater than what it needed to be about. I just wanted to do something and lot of pop music at the time was about love. The last time I sang it, I was a bit drunk and we were sharing stories about the first songs we'd written so I played it because it was easy.
I started on the piano when I was seven. I never had lessons but my dad got me a keyboard just to see if I was interested. He's a very passionate musician. I figured it out and I would work out melodies from tunes that were programmed into the keyboard, like Camp Town Races.
I loved poetry as well. I thought it was fascinating that you could make sentences that made sense as a story but would rhyme. There was something very satisfying about that. It wasn't until I was 11 that I put it all together.
I was about nine when I actually started listening to the words. I remember that song by B*Witched called Blame it on the Weatherman and I remember just wanting to know the lyrics.
It's something I think a lot about, kids' taste compared to teenagers and there's definite differences. It's not to say I didn't enjoy Michael Jackson but B*Witched were girls and I was a girl.
Mary J Blige, too. I thought, "That's a chick, I can do that with my voice, too." And Lauryn Hill, who I loved to try and copy.
When I got to 12, I discovered Jill Scott and that was a big lyrical moment because I didn't think you could say that stuff. She said incredible things that you knew were truthful from the way she said it.
When I started playing guitar. When I was 18, my dad taught me a guitar picking rhythm that he had learnt from Bob Dylan and taught it to me. It took a while to master it but, when I did, that's when I started feeling like, "I have to write something about something".
I was seeing this guy and it was the first time I felt myself falling in love and my heart being broken and the song seemed to explain my situation.
It's the only way to get it out for me. You can talk about it but you might not want to so, for me, songwriting and the creation of a song is the purest happiness that I've ever felt. It makes me happy even when it's about something sad.
It's interesting because when I didn't realise that my relationship was breaking down, the songs that I was writing were not about love, they were about confidence and finding myself.
I think you should write as much about happiness as you do about sadness.
I can't not write about what's happening otherwise it's not for me. I only go on gut feelings now. Once you hit a flow, it just starts to make sense and you just fill in the dots. Sometimes I discover how I feel about things by writing about it.
I used to go in to those things and think, "Hopefully they'll like me," but I realised that although you both have to like it, I'm the one who has to sing it. So, first and foremost, I have to like it and they have to complement me, otherwise I can't do it.
It was the fact that my now ex, who I got back together with in the song, was very interested in astronomy and taught me a lot about it. I remember he bought a telescope and I saw the moon in great detail for the first time; and Jupiter and things like that. So I thought, sentimentally, to connect the lyrics to that because it was all for him.
It also seemed appropriate to liken myself to a satellite that's spun out of orbit because that's how I felt, roaming freely and being my own person but I remembered I needed him.
I think [the phrase] singer-songwriter can put people off because there is that connotation of, "I feel sad, so here's the lyric that means sad but isn't sad". But there is so much more to it when you think about it.
It's not just about the music, it's about life, it's about language and it's film and it's art, so I like to get all of it in. There's this strange continuity of things in life, like how the roots of a tree look like your veins. Because there are so many possibilities with language.
I went to Jamaica to write. Kingston is one of the coolest cities and when I was there, I felt super-badass. I went New York next and I had the words "green and gold" in my head. I loved the imagery of it and then it seemed to develop into where I was from and I thought of a lyric to represent Greece which was "ancient stone". So the chorus was written before the verses.
And then I called Matt Hales (of Aqualung) because it was just a vibe with a chorus and he really liked it and he said, "It feels like you've learnt a lot about where you're from"' so we made it a chronological autobiography. It made sense to start it when I was six, my earliest memories about looking in the mirror and thinking, "Why don't I look like either of my parents?"; then into the second verse as a young lady who has somehow been able to live my dreams.
I feel like music is like a introduction without meeting someone, like someone hearing what you do. It's a way of illustrating yourself. But it's always changing and I'm always searching for the ultimate song and trying to be satisfied more by the next thing. That's why I do it, I just want to make the most pleasing thing possible.
Blood is released on on 31 July on Warner Bros. Records.
