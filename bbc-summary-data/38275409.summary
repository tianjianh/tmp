Kasabian Newton-Smith from Sheffield was diagnosed with cancer as a toddler and had two brain tumours.
Footballer Wayne Rooney sent him his England shirt and other players tweeted with the hashtag #1LastSmile4Kasabian.
Fans at Sheffield United's Bramall Lane applauded in the eighth minute of the club's match against Swindon Town.
Posting online, Kasabian's father said his son "passed peacefully in his sleep".
The social media campaign appealed to professionals and amateurs of the sport to hold one finger in the air and smile for a photograph.
Sheffield United striker Billy Sharp previously tweeted a picture featuring Rooney and Adam Lallana.
Alan Shearer also posted a message of support.
Speaking to the BBC in November, Kasabian's father Simon Newton-Smith said his son had "desperately" wanted to follow in his big brother's footsteps and play football.
He had been diagnosed with Ewing sarcoma and had more than 100 radiation treatments.
Kasabian, who has six brothers and sisters, had taken part in fundraising efforts for Sheffield Children's Hospital and cancer charities.
