RIP tattoo a clue in Spain murder arrest

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Police in Spain who arrested a murder suspect may have been handed a large clue through one of his tattoos.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The unnamed man was sought by German police after the murder of his girlfriend in Bavaria.
Authorities did not know when she died, but one of the man's tattoos gives her name, Lisa, and date of death - 27 October 2016.
The man was held in Lloret de Mar, in Catalonia, with their 18-month-old son, who was in good health.
The woman's body was found by her mother last week. She was found in a block of flats in the town of Freyung, close to the Czech border.
An initial autopsy showed that the woman had died some three weeks before she was found.
Spain's federal police force said her mobile phone was taken by the killer with the intention of using her social media accounts, thus misleading investigators.
The man, named in Germany as Dominik R, was traced to Spain after he was found to have withdrawn money there. A European arrest warrant was then issued. Spanish police say they believe he was heading to north Africa.
A statement by Spain's federal police said the new tattoo "may be interpreted as the date of death".
The suspect is now awaiting extradition to Germany.
