Chris Packham joins badger cull protest in Winchester

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Wildlife expert Chris Packham joined hundreds of campaigners to protest against badger culling.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
About 300 people marched through Winchester from Abbey Gardens.
Mr Packham told the crowd he "vigorously opposed" the cull having studied the ecology and behaviour of badgers since he was a teenager.
The government, which has previously insisted that culling is necessary, began the badger cull in September in a bid to tackle bovine TB.
The pilot culls took place in parts of Somerset and Gloucestershire in 2013.
Mr Packham said these "clearly showed that culling badgers will not stop or help improve the bovine TB situation".
