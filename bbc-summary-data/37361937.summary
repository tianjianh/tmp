Yorkshire-based charity One Nation UK has been taking medicines, clothing and food to war-ravaged parts of the country for several years.
For the first time it is collecting hijabs, which it says helps women to socialise and access public services.
Volunteers in Leicester said they had been particularly successful, collecting more than 2,000 in just one week since the appeal was launched.
The national appeal has more than a dozen collection centres across the country.  Organisers said "thousands" had already come in but Leicester was particularly busy.
Rukhsana Hussain, 36, of Uppingham Road in the city, said: "It's been a really good response. It's been a real surprise. I set aside a room in the house but within two days I needed more room and more help."
"Women in Syria need to be able to access all the help they can and this will allow them to go out to perhaps a local point which is distributing food," she added.
"The hijab is the first thing I look for before going out and imagine how important it would be for making women in Syria feel more comfortable."
The aid container is expected to be sent out in the first week of October.
The charity also runs projects in Bangladesh, Gaza, India, Sierra Leone and Sudan, as well as Syria.
