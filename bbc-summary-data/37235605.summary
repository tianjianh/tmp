[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The blaze was started outside the family's home in Kilmeny Crescent, in the Coltness area of Wishaw, North Lanarkshire, at about 03:10.
It is being treated as wilful after a probe by police and the fire service.
Police said the "dangerous" fire had left the owner "absolutely distraught". They have appealed for witnesses.
Det Con Chris Norton said: "This was a deliberate and dangerous act which has completely destroyed this family's summer house in their garden.
"The damage caused is estimated to be worth a five-figure sum of money and the owner has been left absolutely distraught by what has happened.
"The house is in the middle of a busy residential area in Wishaw and is overlooked by several flats and other properties. It did happen during the night but I would appeal to anyone who was awake around that time and may have seen anything suspicious to get in touch."
