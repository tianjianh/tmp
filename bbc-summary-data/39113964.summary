[SN]TITLE[SN]
Footballer Adam Johnson appeal bid judgement reserved

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Disgraced ex-England footballer Adam Johnson will have to wait to learn whether a fresh appeal against his child sex conviction has been allowed.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 28-year-old was jailed for six years last March for sexually touching and grooming a 15-year-old schoolgirl.
He was later refused leave to appeal his conviction and sentence, but launched a second bid late last year.
A panel of three judges reserved its decision on the new application at the Appeal Court earlier.
A decision will now be made at a future date.
Johnson was found guilty of sexual touching, but not guilty on a charge relating to another sexual act.
The former Sunderland player had previously admitted grooming the girl and one charge of sexual activity.
