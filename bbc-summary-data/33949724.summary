A former inspector has been cleared by the police watchdog over claims he "acted on behalf" of Jimmy Savile.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The ex-West Yorkshire Police officer was accused of contacting Surrey police before they questioned Savile in 2009 over alleged sexual offences.
The Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) said on Saturday that the officer had "no case to answer".
After his death, it became clear Savile was one of the UK's most prolific sexual predators.
West Yorkshire Police was ordered by the IPCC in 2013 to refer the conduct of the officer.
On Saturday, an IPCC spokesman said: "An IPCC investigation has concluded that a former West Yorkshire Police officer has no case to answer over allegations that he "acted on behalf" of Jimmy Savile by inappropriately contacting Surrey Police ahead of a police interview in 2009."
West Yorkshire Police said it had no comment.
Savile was one of Britain's biggest stars, best known for TV favourites like Top of the Pops and Jim'll Fix It as well as stints on BBC Radio 1.
He exploited hundreds of people - assaulting and raping some his victims in television dressing rooms, hospitals, schools, children's homes and his caravan.
