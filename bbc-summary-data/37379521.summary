Alison Jane Farr-Davies, 42, was found dead at a home in Neath Road, Hafod, Swansea, on Tuesday afternoon.
A 37-year-old man who was arrested on suspicion of murder remains in custody.
In a statement, Ms Farr-Davies's family said: "Ali was always helping others and would go out of her way to help people who were less fortunate than her."
Ms Farr-Davies would have turned 43 on Friday - she shared her birthday with her mother.
"This tragedy has robbed them both from celebrating it this year as well as all of us as a family," the statement added.
"As a family we are totally devastated at the loss of our beautiful daughter, sister, aunt and niece.
"Ali was a very gentle, caring and loving person who doted on her two young nieces. She used to love them visiting her and spending time on the beach together."
