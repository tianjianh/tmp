[SN]TITLE[SN]
Newmarket racehorse's 'skeleton' used to teach children

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A retired racehorse has been painted with a skeleton and internal organs to teach primary school children "why the breed is unique among animals".

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
More than 160 pupils were given an anatomy lesson by two vets at the July Course at Newmarket in Suffolk.
Its aim was to teach children how the thoroughbred's organs enable it "to gallop at speed and over a sustained distance".
The event was organised by the British Horseracing Authority.
The horse, an eight-year-old gelding called Gee Major, retired after winning three races and lives at the British Racing School in Newmarket.
Newmarket Equine Hospital vets Ben Jacklin and Will Barker described the "remarkable physique of a racehorse" to the children, who attend primary schools in Cambridgeshire and Suffolk.
The event was organised by the authority as part of its The Horse Comes First campaign, which "raises awareness among children and racegoers of the first class care given to racehorses during and after their racing careers".
