Bridget Mongan, 23, admits being drunk at the time, but said the officers should have left her on the pavement.
She said she "could've been killed".
The incident happened on John Street in Derry on Monday and is being investigated by the Police Ombudsman.
The BBC obtained CCTV footage that showed the moments leading up to the incident on St Patrick's Day.
The officers in the mobile phone video have been identified, police said.
Two investigators have been appointed.
"My boyfriend was arrested and I got a bit upset," said Ms Mongan.
"I could have been killed stone dead. What they did to me is totally unacceptable.
"I don't remember how I ended up lying on the road. I don't remember a whole lot," she added.
"From what I remember, the officers didn't say anything to me before they left.
"I was drunk, yes, but they could've at least left me on the footpath. It's out of order, it's as simple as that.
"It's not their job to do that. I cried when I saw the footage. I am a human being you know.
"They should lose their job now. If they did to me, they could do it to everyone.
"I am an alcoholic and I'm not proud of it but they what they did on Monday was unacceptable."
In a statement on Wednesday, Police Ombudsman Dr Michael Maguire said he had viewed the footage and had begun an investigation.
