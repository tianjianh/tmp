The 43-year-old replaces former head coach Luke Williams, who left the County Ground in May following the club's relegation to League Two.
"David has a fantastic footballing background," a club statement said.
"He has been given a very competitive budget and will now begin the job of putting a squad together with the aim of competing at the top of League Two."
In May, Mansfield Town refused Swindon - who finished 22nd in League One in 2016-17 - permission to speak to their boss Steve Evans, and chairman Lee Power said the search was down to "three candidates".
Former England striker Teddy Sheringham - who previously managed Stevenage in League Two - had been linked with the vacancy.
Swindon's statement continued: "The club has taken its time over this appointment as it was vital after relegation that we got the right man to take the club forward and give us the best chance of promotion back to League One at the first time of asking.
"We are convinced David is this man. Most importantly, he knows this level of football and how to get out of it, having guided Bury to promotion from the League Two during the 2014-15 campaign."
The job is former Chester City, Rochdale and Bury midfielder Flitcroft's third in management, after parting company with Bury in November after an 11-game winless run.
He was in charge at Gigg Lane for almost three years, having previously helped Barnsley avoid relegation from the Championship in 2012-13 after a dramatic final-day draw at Huddersfield.
Swindon appointed former Tottenham boss Tim Sherwood as director of football in November, but he took a step back from the role before the end of the season and the Robins are now expected to move away from the head coach and director of football model, with the appointment of new manager Flitcroft.
The Wiltshire outfit will be playing in the fourth tier for the first time since 2012 next season.
