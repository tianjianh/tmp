Tennent Caledonian freezes on-trade wholesale prices

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Tennent Caledonian has announced a 12-month freeze in the wholesale price of its major brands to Scottish hotels, pubs and clubs.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The freeze applies to brands such as Tennent's Lager and Caledonia Best.
C&C Group-owned Tennent's said the move was designed to "further support Scotland's hospitality industry".
The company also announced it was changing the trading name of its sales and distribution arm from Wallaces TCB to Tennent's.
Wallaces TCB was formed after C&C Group bought wines and spirits wholesaler Wallaces Express in 2014.
Tennent's managing director Alastair Campbell said: "Scotland's pubs, club, hotels and restaurants are at the heart of our communities and part of the social fabric of our cities, towns and villages.
"Throughout our rich history dating back hundreds of years, Tennent's has been the strongest supporter of Scotland's licensed trade, and today we re-emphasise that commitment.
"We understand the challenges they're facing and, while other brewers have announced price increases to the trade, we are pleased to freeze the wholesale list price of our leading draught brands including Tennent's Lager, Caledonia Best, Magners Original Ice Cold Cider, Heverlee and Menabrea for the year ahead.
"This is further evidence of our support of the trade, allowing owners to direct greater investment into their businesses and help sustain jobs."
