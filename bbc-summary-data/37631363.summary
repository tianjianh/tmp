The county hosted the opening stage of the Tour de France in 2014 and has since held two editions of a three-day stage race, the Tour of Yorkshire.
Welcome to Yorkshire led the bid with partners UK Sport and British Cycling.
"It'll be the biggest sporting event in the UK in 2019," chief executive Sir Gary Verity told BBC Sport.
"It rounds off a decade of great sport for the country and for us in Yorkshire having had the Tour de France in 2014, two editions already of the Tour de Yorkshire and to have this huge cycling event coming here cements us as one of the cycling capitals of Europe.
"Yorkshire is a perfect fit. We've got great scenery, passion for the sport and a cycling heritage going back years. People like Brian Robinson,Tom Simpson and Beryl Burton."
More than 2.5m people turned out to watch the first two stages of the 2014 Tour de France, and more than a million spectators turned out to see the 2016 Tour de Yorkshire race.
Verity added: "We anticipate that we'll have millions of people turning out, as we had for the Tour de France in 2014 and have had every year for the Tour of Yorkshire.
"We will put on a fantastic event in 2019 for the world, for the UK and for [cycling's governing body] the UCI. We're thrilled for everyone involved, and everyone who loves cycling."
UCI president Brian Cookson, who announced the decision, said: "Yorkshire has proved it is a fitting host for road cycling's leading annual event. We are sure there will be world-class crowds to match."
Britain last hosted the championships in Goodwood in 1982. This year's edition is currently under way in Doha, the Qatari capital.
On Wednesday German Tony Martin won a joint-record fourth title in the men's individual time trial, one day after American Amber Neben won her second title in the women's event.
The women's elite road race takes place on Saturday, with Britain's Lizzie Deignan the defending champion.
The men's elite road race is on Sunday, with Britain's Mark Cavendish among the favourites.
