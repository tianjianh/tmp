[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A recycling plant where a 2,000-tonne rubbish fire has been burning for four days has had its licence suspended.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Residents are being advised to keep their windows closed after acrid smoke spread from the blaze at Llandow Industrial Estate.
Natural Resources Wales (NRW) said it had suspended the licence of site operators SiteServ Recycling.
On Monday, three fire crews remained at the scene of the fire which started on Thursday.
South Wales Fire and Rescue Service said the risk to health is thought to be low but the smoke could cause nose and eye irritation, and coughing.
Nadia De Longhi, operations manager for NRW, said the suspension notice would prevent more waste being brought into the site.
