The Rail, Maritime and Transport (RMT) union said 500 track patrol staff plan join 1,500 maintenance workers in a 24-hour strike from 18:00 GMT on Friday.
The track patrol staff are in dispute over the use of private contractors, which they say will "casualise" their jobs.
Transport for London (TfL) said it was still trying to assess the impact the walk-outs would have.
Maintenance staff are planning up to seven separate strikes up to June over what the RMT calls "lethal changes to track access".
The RMT said as track workers check the network for faults and maintenance workers fix any problems, there would be concerns as to whether the Tube could run safely during the walk-out.
London Underground said safety was its top priority and more talks were planned next week.
