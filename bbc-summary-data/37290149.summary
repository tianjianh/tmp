[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Wasps took an early lead as Jimmy Gopperth slotted two penalties and set up a Christian Wade try, either side of Freddie Burns' penalty.
Lachlan McCaffrey replied for Tigers, but after half-time Guy Thompson and Sam Jones opened up a 27-8 Wasps lead.
Leicester clawed their way back through Ed Slater and three Burns penalties before Gopperth's try.
Both sides came into the game having started their 2016-17 campaigns with victories, but Wasps made the better start in an error-strewn first half.
The away side led 13-8 at the break and Leicester were again caught sleeping at the start of the second period as Wasps side stretched their advantage to 19 points.
Tigers began their charge with 30 minutes left as fly-half Burns set up Slater and slotted three penalties to bring his side back to 22-27, with Wasps' Guy Thompson in the sin-bin.
But Leicester's comeback was halted when Ellis Genge and Peter Betham saw yellow.
Gopperth, having missed two penalties to put his side beyond reach, secured victory as the clock turned red with a dart over the line from the back of the Wasps maul.
Leicester director of rugby Richard Cockerill: "I'm disappointed with parts of our game. It was good to get back into the game with 12 minutes left.
"But we got outfought in too many departments and Wasps played well and deserved to win.
"We are too easy to play against at the moment. The stats don't lie, conceding eight tries in two games is not good enough.
"It's my fault and we will have to get on top of that and make sure we get better very quickly."
Wasps director of rugby Dai Young: "You don't come here and win too many times. Since I have been at Wasps we have not won here. So we have to enjoy it.
"We found a way to win in the last 10 minutes. The good thing is that we have won without the perfect performance. In years gone by we would have had to play out of our skin.
"Jimmy Gopperth has been really good for us. I have shown in my recruitment that we want to play with a ball-playing 12 and play an expansive game.
"With players injured Jimmy was the best to play 12 and in fairness he has responded well. He has been a foil for Danny Cipriani as well. He takes the pressure off Danny with the kicking."
