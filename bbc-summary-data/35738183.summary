The 23-year-old broke the world number 38's serve five times in a dominant display in Mexico as she sealed victory in one hour and seven minutes.
Watson, whose ranking has dropped to 84, did not face a break point and lost only three points on her first serve.
She will meet Belgium's Kirsten Flipkens in Sunday's final as she aims to win her third WTA title.
Watson previously won the Japan Open in 2012 and Hobart International in January 2015.
"I'm very happy to be in the final. I've played Kirsten a few times and she's very experienced," she said.
"It definitely won't be easy so I'm going to have to bring my A-game tomorrow."
World number 73 Flipkens knocked out British number one Johanna Konta 6-3 6-7 (2-7) 6-1 in the quarter-finals.
