Home owners will have to pay an average of £47 more in council tax for a band D property in Wales from April.

Official figures show the average increase in 2016/17 will go up to £1,374 which includes county council, community council and police precepts.
Blaenau Gwent is the most expensive area where the annual fee stands at £1,695, with Neath Port Talbot and Merthyr Tydfil following behind.
Pembrokeshire has the lowest rates at £1,071.
Every local authority area will see a rise in taxes as councils try to balance their books in the wake of continuing budget cuts.
Welsh Local Government Association chief executive Steve Thomas said the latest rises were "consistent" with those over the last 10 years.
He added: "We are trying to run more services based on council tax income.
"Would we like it to be lower? Possibly, but if we are going to pay for these services, the council taxes are vital for local authorities."
Last week, a report found a shake-up of the council tax system and a re-valuing of homes was needed, 11 years since tax bands were last reviewed.
