[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Dover took the lead on 15 minutes when Miller turned well and slotted the ball into the bottom corner.
Moments later Guiseley almost equalised but Kevan Hurst's corner was headed wide by Jake Cassidy.
Hurst then had a couple of attempts of his own, including a 40-yard effort, while Miller lashed an effort just wide as the visitors looked to double their advantage.
Miller also hit the post after the break but the Whites did make it 2-0 on 67 minutes as Ricky Modeste headed home from close range.
Miller grabbed his second with a penalty on 81 minutes and Ross Lafayette added a spot-kick of his own in added time to seal a comprehensive victory.
