Six Nations 2016: Seymour seeks Scotland consistency

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Tommy Seymour is urging Scotland to keep up their momentum and end the Six Nations campaign on a high.

After ending a run of nine consecutive defeats in the competition, the Scots seek a hat-trick of victories when they take on Ireland in Dublin on Saturday.
"The real key for this team is getting wins and backing them up and increasing that confidence," said wing Seymour.
"We definitely have the potential to do it, to be a team that is consistently challenging and winning games."
Wins over Italy and France have propelled Scotland up to third place in the table going into the final weekend.
"It's as much about playing for the 80 minutes," said Glasgow Warriors' Seymour.
"Against England, we didn't have an 80-minute performance or at least a large proportion, and that makes it very hard to get victories. We probably had a couple of lapses against England and Wales, which allowed them to get tries.
"The Italy victory gave us confidence and France was probably the most complete performance from us during the tournament.
"The next step is doing that on a consistent basis. There is no point in ebbing and flowing, playing to your potential one week and dipping back down the next week.
"That is something we have talked about a lot over the last 18 months."
Scotland are aiming for a third consecutive win in the tournament for the first time since 1996, when it was the Five Nations, but Seymour pays little heed to such statistics.
"It's two wins, we have played some good stuff and enjoyed the success but we're not getting ahead of ourselves," said the 27-year-old.
"Ireland in Dublin are an incredibly tough team. I know they are not going to be champions again this year but they have been the leaders in terms of northern hemisphere rugby for the last few seasons. So it's a serious step for us to take.
"Obviously if we play for 80 minutes and play well then we are in with a shout but there is no point looking at facts and figures and the history books, we have to concentrate on controllable aspects.

"They have ebbed and flowed through the tournament as well but they have come off a huge win against Italy, which will give them a huge amount of confidence. They got nine tries and ran rampant and I'm sure they will be keen to back that up.
"Unless we go over there with full capacity, it's going to be a difficult day."
