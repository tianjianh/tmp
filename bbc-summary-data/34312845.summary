The beauty of car parks

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Car parks don't usually feature high on the list of photographic assignments, yet, following a chance meeting at Henley Royal Regatta, photographer Phil Burrowes found himself commissioned by NCP (National Car Parks) to produce images of 20 of their car parks across the country.

Burrowes spent three weeks of long days photographing these often overlooked pieces of architecture.
"I wanted to capture the scale of the car parks, to evoke a sense of awe," he says.
"With such a scope of detail to record, incredible shapes and patterns, basically a photographer's dream, I needed to give a nod to the architects, the thought that has gone into the amazing design of these buildings allowing me to show the shape and form of them, but coupled with the lighting design too."
Each day Burrowes would arrive on site before sunrise and continue working through the day, past dusk, to show each car park in the best light he could, often waiting until night-time.
"I would get many a funny look from passers-by wondering what on earth this guy with a camera was doing photographing a car park in the middle of a rainy and cold Manchester.
"But it was reassuring to see that many of these people would look up to what I was photographing - literally stopping in their tracks to appreciate a building they had taken for granted, taking a second look at something they may have never appreciated may contain beauty.
"The final image sums up perfectly what we were trying to do with the project. Salford New Bailey car park is brand new - it opened the week I photographed it.
"It was a miserable day and heavy showers had soaked me to the bone but this was my last chance to photograph it. I had been out in the cold and the wet all day and I was desperate to get to my hotel and rest, but come 8pm it was still raining.
"I was sheltering under a railway bridge and the warm lights and massive car park looked like a welcoming beacon to me, a wet, cold and tired traveller, keen to return to my car.
"My perception of car parks had been changed. It wasn't a municipal, utilitarian behemoth, it was an open, dry, well-lit and welcoming sight, a place I longed to enter. It was paradise."
