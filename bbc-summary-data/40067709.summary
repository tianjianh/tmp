A service was being held in Wrexham on Friday evening when a 49-year-old was arrested for public order offences.
The vigil was being held on Llwyn Isaf in the town.
Bomber Salman Abedi killed 22 people when he blew himself up as the victims left an Ariana Grande concert at the Manchester Arena on Monday.
Nine men - aged between 18 and 44 - are in custody on suspicion of terror offences in connection with the attack.
A total of 11 people have been arrested in the UK, including Abedi's 24-year-old brother Ismail, but two were later released.
A total of 66 people remain in hospital, with 23 in critical care.
Meanwhile, US singer Grande has said she will return to the "incredibly brave city" for a benefit concert.
