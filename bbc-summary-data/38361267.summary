Lincoln were knocked off the top of the National League after Will Hatfield's late goal secured a 2-1 victory for Guiseley.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Hatfield netted his second goal of the game in the 90th minute to move the hosts off the bottom of the table and condemn the Imps, who were leapfrogged by Tranmere, to a first defeat in 13 league matches.
Hatfield had fired Guiseley into a 12th-minute lead, drilling home following Michael Rankine's cross, but Luke Waterfall equalised when heading in Nathan Arnold's corner.
