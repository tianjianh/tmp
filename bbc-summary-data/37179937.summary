Hull's Amy Johnson completed the journey from London to Darwin in 1930.
To mark 75 years since her death, engineers from the University of Hull have worked with Glasgow School of Art to create a fully interactive digital 3D version of the pioneering pilot.
It will be on display in Hull's Central Library as part of a festival celebrating her life and achievements.
The "virtual Amy" was created using the same technology used in blockbuster Hollywood films.
An actress was filmed using a motion tracking camera and her movements were transformed into the digital character.
Rick Welton, the director of the Amy Johnson Festival, said: "The virtual Amy project showcases how the technology and engineering can be used to create something visually stunning.
"The aim of the Amy Johnson Festival is to inspire people, especially women, to take an interest in engineering, as well as demonstrating how engineering blends with art and design."
Amy Johnson was born in Hull in July 1903 and became an international celebrity after her 19-day flight to Australia.
During World War Two she joined the Air Transport Auxiliary flying aircraft from factories to RAF airbases. She died in mysterious circumstances when her plane crashed in to the Thames Estuary on 5 January 1941. Her body was never found.
