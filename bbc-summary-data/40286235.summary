Mr Annan is to give a speech at the Wilberforce Lecture, which celebrates the work of Hull-born abolitionist William Wilberforce, who lobbied to ban the slave trade and introduced anti-slavery motions in parliament.
Councillor Andy Dorton, chair of the Wilberforce Lecture Trust, said: "Mr Annan is a prominent figure and the Kofi Annan Foundation seeks to mobilise political will to overcome threats to peace, development and human rights.
"His experience in this important global issue and the messages Mr Annan will share at the lecture will no doubt resonate strongly with the purpose of the Wilberforce Lecture Trust and what we are trying to accomplish."
