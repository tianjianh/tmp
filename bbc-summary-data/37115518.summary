Caroline Roberts, 61, worked as a nanny for the pair when she was a teenager.
Her friend Andy Jones said she was a "brave lady" who had survived "appalling torture and abuse".
Fred West killed himself in prison in 1995 while awaiting trial on 12 murder charges. Rosemary West was convicted of murdering 10 young girls and women.
Mr Jones, who runs the Crime Through Time museum in Littledean, Gloucestershire, said Mrs Roberts was "always a very brave, caring, much-loved lady and mother".
He said: "She had survived appalling torture and abuse at the hands of evil serial killers Fred and Rose West.
"Caroline would never shy away from telling her traumatic life story and always felt a strong sense of guilt that she survived whilst many others did not."
Mrs Roberts was a key prosecution witness in Rose West's trial.
She was kidnapped, raped and tortured at the "House of Horrors" in Cromwell Street, Gloucester, in 1972 when she was 17 and working as a nanny.
Speaking to the BBC in 2004 she said she felt guilty that other victims of the Wests had died.
She said: "I still think about it, the fact that I didn't push a rape charge, some of these girls could have lived."
