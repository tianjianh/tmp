The spectacular event celebrating Shetland's Viking heritage was held in Lerwick on Tuesday.
A band of latter-day Viking warriors known as the Jarl Squad marched through the town, recreating its history.
Hundreds processed with flaming torches which were thrown into a longship that had been dragged through Lerwick.
Volunteers had built the boat and produced more than 1,000 torches, with preparations for the event beginning in October.
