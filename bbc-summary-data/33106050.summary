A plan to create a mandatory licensing scheme for tattoo and piercing parlours has been criticised for its limited scope.

The Welsh government revealed the plan in the Public Health Bill on Tuesday.
Save Face, a voluntary register which represents more than 300 medical professionals, said the bill should extend to other non-surgical cosmetic treatments like Botox.
In response, the government said it was looking at a number of recommendations.
Save Face, based in Talbot Green, Rhondda Cynon Taff, wants a mandatory register for all practitioners who offer non-surgical cosmetic procedures.
It claims this would help to ensure customers, who pay for treatments like laser hair removal, chemical peels and facial fillers, know who they can trust.
Director Ashton Collins said treatments like Botox, dermal fillers and laser treatments should also be included in the bill.
"What it does is muddy the waters a little bit for consumers," she said.
"In choosing to exclude certain treatments that are accessible in these sorts of outlets like beauty salons, [it] does create a perception that just because that beauty salon has a licence, that everything they do there is covered and actually it's not."
A review carried out in 2013 by Sir Bruce Keogh, the NHS medical director for England, recommended creating a register of everyone who performs surgical or non-surgical cosmetic interventions.
It also called for formal qualifications for anyone who injects fillers or Botox. The findings of that review were passed on to health ministers across the UK.
In a statement, the Welsh government said: "We are working with the UK government to take forward a number of the recommendations in the Review of the Regulation of Cosmetic Interventions, including in relation to dermal fillers and Botox.
"If the UK government does not act in this area, the Public Health (Wales) Bill would give Welsh ministers the power to extend the scope of the special procedures legislation to include other procedures beyond acupuncture, body piercing, electrolysis and tattooing.
"We are confident our proposals will create a safer and skilled cosmetic industry, which will reassure consumers and practitioners in Wales."
