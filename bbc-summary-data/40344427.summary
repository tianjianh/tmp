Zebroski, 30, and Flitney, 33, have both agreed one-year deals.
After arriving from Gillingham in March 2013, Flitney made 93 appearances for Eastleigh before moving on last season, first to Whitehawk, then Bromley.
Zebroski was on Eastleigh's books for four months from March 2013, before leaving to join Newport County.
His time in south Wales came to an end when he was jailed for four years and four months for robbery and assault.
The new contract with Eastleigh is his first since being released from prison.
Eastleigh, now under the new management of Richard Hill and ex-Gillingham boss Andy Hessenthaler, finished 15th last season.
Their first two signings this summer were Crewe Alexandra midfielder Danny Hollands and Leyton Orient striker Paul McCallum.
