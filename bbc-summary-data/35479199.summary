David Healy's Blues had the points in the bag by half-time with Andrew Waterworth, Paul Smyth and Mark Stafford scoring at Windsor Park.
Waterworth drove in a 15th-minute opener, Smyth broke through to make it 2-0 and defender Stafford forced in from close-range on 38 minutes.
Stafford scored again and Aaron Burns and Michael McLellan also netted.
Linfield have won six in a row and are six points behind leaders Crusaders.
Dungannon remain 10th in the Premiership table, three points ahead of bottom club Warrenpoint Town.
Linfield manager David Healy: "Six goals maybe flattered us a bit, but it was another clean sheet for us too.
"We got the goals at the right time. It was a big win for us and keeps us in it.
"We are on a decent run and will just focus on doing our jobs."
Dungannon Swifts manager Rodney McAree: "If you come to Windsor Park and defend the way we did, it is always going to be a difficult evening.
"We did not deal with set pieces and did not show courage and hunger. We just lacked tonight.
"At half-time, I looked around the dressing room and did not see much belief that we could get anything from the game."
