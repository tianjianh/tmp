Dickin Drew, one of the three, said about 150 people attended a public meeting on the issue on Tuesday and 80-90% were behind their proposals.
They have raised concerns over costs, the service and Aurigny's plan to replace the trislander aircraft.
The three will lobby the States of Guernsey, which has backed the plan.
Mr Drew said: "We were amazed by the turnout... [there's] an anxiety and lack of trust in Aurigny."
He said the majority were in favour of keeping the "workhorse" trislander planes and setting up an airline dedicated to Alderney.
Mr Drew said the group, whose other members are John Cadoret and Mike Harrisson, would work up a business case for an airline following discussions with Britten Norman, which manufactures the trislander.
The group's proposals include the Alderney airline taking the name Aurigny, while the Guernsey-based airline rebrands.
In response, Aurigny said it would not be providing anyone for interview or issuing a statement.
The airline, which has the Norman name for Alderney, started in the island in 1968, but later moved its base to Guernsey and employs about 290 people across the Channel Islands.
