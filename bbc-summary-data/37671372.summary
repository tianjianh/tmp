Leeds and Liverpool Canal: Bicentenary of canal marked with voyage

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The 200th anniversary of England's longest man-made waterway is being marked with a nine-day voyage.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The inaugural 1816 boat passage by Yorkshire and Lancashire merchants on the 127-mile Leeds and Liverpool Canal is being recreated on a former working boat called Kennet.
Members of the Canal and River Trust and the Leeds and Liverpool Canal Society set off from Leeds on Saturday.
Brass bands and crowds have greeted the boat along the way on its journey.
They plan to arrive in Liverpool on 23 October.
The boat will have to negotiate 91 locks, climb nearly 152m (500ft) over the Pennine hills and cruise through the one-mile Foulridge Tunnel.
Trip organiser Harold Bond said: "Back in 1816, press reports state that the ceremonial first boat was greeted by pealing church bells, brass bands and cheering crowds, and canal barges were bedecked in flags and streamers.
"We are hoping to recreate that amazing atmosphere of celebration again."
Chantelle Seaborn, local waterway manager with the Canal and River Trust, said: "The opening of the Leeds and Liverpool Canal played a key role in Britain's Industrial Revolution and encouraged the development of the textile industries in Lancashire and West Yorkshire."
