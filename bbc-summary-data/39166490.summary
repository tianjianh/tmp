The match at Deva Stadium continued after the club "took the advice of the officials and emergency personnel".
The man's identity has yet to be revealed.
"Thoughts are with the family of the @ChesterFC fan who passed away at the game tonight. The game was insignificant. Awful news. RIP," Chester defender Ross Killock said.
Tranmere won the game 3-2 to move up to second place in the National League table.
Among the Chester goalscorers was striker James Alabi, who said: "Tough game to take. I want to dedicate my goal to the fan that sadly passed away today at the game, my deepest thoughts are with the family."
The club have offered condolences to the family, adding: "We will seek to offer all the support we possibly can to the family at this terrible time."
