[SN]TITLE[SN]
Derby County 0-0 Brentford

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Derby's struggle for goals continued as they were held to a frustrating stalemate by Brentford.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Scott Carson was at full stretch to tip a header from Brentford's John Egan behind, while Tom Ince saw his free-kick turned over by visiting keeper Daniel Bentley.
The visitors almost scored when Scott Hogan rounded Carson, but he could only find the side netting.
Derby, who have just seven goals in 13 games, are three points off relegation.
Johnny Russell and Ince had the Rams' best second-half chances, while Romaine Sawyers had a penalty shout waved away for Brentford.
Despite the lack of goals, Steve McClaren's Derby side are now on a four-game unbeaten run, conceding just once in the process.
Their lack of attacking impetus was compounded by James Wilson's knee injury in training, and they also lost Will Hughes, who limped off midway through the first half.
Brentford, winless in three games, are just a point outside the top six and rarely looked in trouble against their hosts.
The clean sheet was their first against Derby in 11 attempts, going back to 1953, and they have not won an away game against the Rams since 1939.
Derby County manager Steve McClaren:  "The first half was too slow, no tempo and a little too safe.
"But we've got to play football with these players, they are football players, we can't play long ball.
"At times they are making mistakes but that will progress and will get better and I had no faults apart from in the final third where we needed that bit of magic.
"A draw was probably a fair result, we huffed and puffed without blowing the house down."
Brentford head coach Dean Smith: "I don't know if we deserved to win but we certainly deserved a penalty.
"It was a double whammy and how it's not given I don't know. I think their bench was embarrassed it wasn't given as well.
"I thought our performance was very good, very disciplined and the intensity of pressing in our half was very good.
"Derby have got very good players but had very few clear-cut chances and I think our goalkeeper was rarely troubled.
