Pulis has a year left on his deal at The Hawthorns and says he will sit down with chairman Jeremy Peace in the summer to discuss his future.
Albion are 11th in the Premier League, 13 points clear of the relegation zone with seven games remaining, before a trip to Manchester City on Saturday.
"I would prefer to sit with Jeremy and have a nice glass of wine and a bite to eat," said the 58-year-old.
"We'll talk about the season and talk about the future. That's what I have done for years.
"I still have a year left, there's no rush in doing anything else."
