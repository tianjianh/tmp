The Newlyn-based vessel reported taking on water on Friday afternoon.
A search and rescue helicopter from RNAS Culdrose was scrambled but stood down when the RNLI's Sennen Cove Lifeboat towed the vessel to shore.
Large salvage water pumps were used to get the situation under control. The outcome "could have been very nasty," the UK coastguard said.
Brian Simpson, a spokesman for the Sennen Cove Lifeboat, described it as a "serious situation" and said the boat had a "bad leak."
"They they could have lost their lives had the lifeboat not got there quickly or had they been further out at sea," he said.
