[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man has admitted secretly filming a female friend in her flat and uploading naked pictures of her to the internet.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Stanley Gibbs, 35, covertly set up recording devices in the woman's Glasgow home and published them online under the username "Psycho Stan".
He was caught after a friend of the woman saw them and told her. Police were called and recovered 60,000 moving images on devices owned by Gibbs.
At Glasgow Sheriff Court, sentence was deferred and Gibbs' bail continued.
Gibbs, a business analyst from Erskine, Renfrewshire, pleaded guilty to using electronic devices to record the woman in a state of undress.
He also admitted uploading indecent footage of her on to the internet and recording her without her knowledge between October 2012 and June 2014.
The court heard Gibbs and the woman had been friends for a number of years and that he regularly visited the flat where she stayed.
In June, last year, a friend of the woman was online and recognised various pictures of her.
The person who uploaded the images used the name "Psycho Stan" and claimed that the woman was unaware they had been taken and that he got "sexual gratification" from the pictures.
The friend saved everything on to a USB stick and contacted the woman to advise her she should leave her flat.
The police were then alerted and a search warrant was granted for Gibbs' house.
He was detained and interviewed by police before being cautioned and charged.
Electronic equipment was seized including a laptop, hard drive, mobile phone and tablet, as well as a digital camera.
They were analysed and 60,000 moving images found which were taken "covertly".
The court heard much of the footage was of "day-to-day" business, although indecent footage was also captured.
It was heard that the woman was "shocked and disgusted" and that she had "trusted the accused like family".
