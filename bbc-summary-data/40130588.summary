Portsmouth police hub gets go-ahead

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A new police hub complex for eastern Hampshire has been given the go-ahead.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The police investigation centre is due to be built on a site leased on the Merlin Park Development off Airport Service Road in Portsmouth.
Police and crime commissioner (PCC) Michael Lane said it would keep policing "in the heart of the city".
Plans for the complex which includes a 36-cell custody suite and investigation facilities, were granted planning permission by Portsmouth City Council.
Mr Lane said the new centre was a "much-needed resource" which would serve Portsmouth, Fareham, Waterlooville, Havant and Hayling Island.
"This new centre builds on the achievement of our centres in Southampton and Basingstoke to bring constabulary colleagues together for more effective and efficient delivery of the policing service."
It is due to open in spring 2019.
Portsmouth Central and Fareham Police Stations will be retained until the new police centre is operational and the investigative functions at Fratton and Havant police stations will also move to the new site.
A site near Havant had previously been considered by former PCC Simon Hayes, but was thought to be too expensive and too far from the city.
