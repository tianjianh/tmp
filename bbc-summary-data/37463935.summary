The Binos parted company with McLaren on Saturday after a 4-0 home defeat to Elgin City.
That loss left them second bottom of Scottish League Two.
"No one could have worked harder than Stuart and I wish him every success in the future," said chairman Stuart Brown on the official website.
Former Stirling player McLaren was appointed boss in November 2014 following a spell managing Australian side Brisbane Strikers.
However, he could not save them from relegation, and they finished seventh last season.
