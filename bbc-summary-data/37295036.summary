Chatsworth House: Hadid sculpture part of annual exhibition

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An "architecturally ambitious" piece by Zaha Hadid is to be included in this year's Chatsworth House sculpture exhibition.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The show features 19 exhibits around the 105-acre garden in Derbyshire.
Lilas, by Dame Zaha, who died earlier this year, was originally created for the Serpentine Gallery at Kensington Gardens.
The exhibition also features work from artists from Spain, Portugal and Taiwan.
The sculptures will be on show until 30 October and members of the public can bid to buy them.
Some of the work for the exhibition, including Bruce Munro's piece Time and Again, has been created specifically for Chatsworth.
It was inspired by the house's success in growing some of the earliest Victorian water lilies after seeds were first brought to England from British Guiana in 1837.
