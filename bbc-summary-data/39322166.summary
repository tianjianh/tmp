Devils won 6-2 at Sheffield Steelers to seal their fifth league crown and their first for 20 years.
"Three years ago we were ninth placed and now we're winning the league in Sheffield. It doesn't get any better than this," Canadian Lord said.
"There's been so much work put in by everyone involved. It's truly amazing."
Lord, who scored in the win over Steelers, was also thankful for the support of the team's fans, who had travelled in large numbers to South Yorkshire.
"I'm so happy for the fanbase," Lord added. "We're so fortunate to play here and they make it great."
Cardiff-born forward Matthew Myers had previously won the Elite League with the Nottingham Panthers in 2013.
The 32-year-old added another Elite League title to the Challenge Cup medal he won with the Devils earlier this season.
"It's great to win anything and we've been fortunate to win two this season," Myers said.
"Sheffield did not want us to win in their own building and they played a good game but thankfully we came out on top."
