Election 2017: Theresa May to make third Welsh campaign visit

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Prime Minister Theresa May is to make a campaign stop in Wales as the general election campaign heads towards its close.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
There are now just two days until polling day, which takes place on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Liberal Democrat leader Tim Farron will visit the Montgomeryshire constituency.
Plaid Cymru will visit a GP surgery in Cardiff West, and Welsh Labour and UKIP will conduct local campaigning.
Theresa May has already visited Wales twice while on the campaign trail.
Her earlier visits to Bridgend and Wrexham were both in constituencies the Conservatives are hoping they can take from Labour.
Mr Farron's party will again raise concerns about the effect of leaving the EU as the Lib Dem leader plans to visit a beef and sheep farm to discuss the potential impact on the industry.
Plaid is planning to visit a doctor's surgery in Cardiff to highlight GP shortages - an issue where the responsibility lies with the Welsh Government.
