New Zealand v Wales: Aaron Jarvis to join Wales before All Blacks game

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Tight-head prop Aaron Jarvis is flying to New Zealand to join Wales as cover for Paul James, who has a calf injury.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Jarvis, 29, has won 17 caps for Wales and last played in the Six Nations win over Italy in March 2016.
James, who will miss the first match of the three-Test series against the world champions in Auckland, has not recovered as quickly as hoped, but remains with the squad.
Wales have lost 26 matches against the All Blacks since beating them in 1953.
James is also likely to miss the game against the Chiefs in Hamilton on Tuesday, 14 June.
Jarvis, who is joining French Top 14 side Clermont Auvergne from Ospreys, will arrive on Wednesday morning in New Zealand.
The Exeter-born player graduated to professional rugby via the Bath academy, and played for England Under-16s and U19s.
But he successfully pursued Wales honours via Ospreys, having been eligible because of his Merthyr Tydfil-born grandmother.
He has started six Wales games, coming off the bench for the remainder of his caps.
