The three-day event, held in Llanbedrog, Gwynedd, cancelled its Saturday programme due to "extremely severe weather."
But all five stages are open on Sunday, with the original line-up due to perform.
A yellow "be aware" weather warning was issued for every council area in Wales until 21:00 BST on Saturday.
In a statement on Facebook, the festival team said: "The festival site is coming together well. We've worked hard to keep the site safe, secure and in good shape.
"We've had to make changes, but the site looks awesome and we'll be set for 12 noon."
Saturday tickets can be used for Sunday's event. The site opens at 12:00 BST.
