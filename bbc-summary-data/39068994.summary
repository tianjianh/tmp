[SN]TITLE[SN]
Briton David Ezekiel presumed murdered in South Africa

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A British man has been found dead, presumed murdered, in South Africa, his family has said.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
London-born David Ezekiel, 60, moved to South Africa 35 years ago, but went missing last week.
The grandfather-of-two, who lived alone and has brothers in Hertfordshire, had been the subject of a social media campaign to try and find out what had happened to him.
Family sources have now said his body has been found.
A former chef, Mr Ezekiel more recently ran a handyman business.
It is thought he drove out of his gated community in Johannesburg, in a convoy with two other vehicles, to try to do a car deal.
