Police found seven bags of cannabis and some cocaine in the raid at the Lomax club on 14 February.
Merseyside Police said it had "no option" but to revoke the licence as club managers were not "willing to accept their responsibilities".
But, the new management said it wants to work with authorities, adding it was disappointed by the licence decision.
Police investigations also led to the closure of two other Liverpool clubs.
Republik on Bold Street was closed on 20 February while Liverpool City Council's licensing committee recently decided Garlands could reopen in three months' time after it was raided by police on 13 February.
The latter's management agreed to certain conditions, including placing security staff in the toilets.
Ch Supt Jon Ward said: "Sadly, the management at the Lomax have not shown the same willingness, or desire, to adhere to the same high standards as other premises in the city.
"As a result the licensing committee has today revoked the club's licence."
After the Lomax raid, four people were charged with drugs offences and a woman remains on bail without charge.
The club would have to apply for a new licence if it aims to reopen in the future, a council spokesman said.
Vincent Spencer, a trustee of the new management board said he was extremely disappointed as the decision risked the club's future.
"I do not understand the council's position. The councillors had an opportunity to listen to what we had to say," he said.
"What we want to do, is to work with the council and the police completely in making sure that what happened, never happens again.
"The council's position should be to preserve this iconic venue.... we cannot afford the overheads while it is not trading."
