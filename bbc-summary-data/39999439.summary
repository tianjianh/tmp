Kurtley Beale: Wasps hope Australia star will be fit for Premiership final swansong

Wasps are hoping Kurtley Beale will be fit for the Premiership final, in what would be his last game for the club before he returns to Australia.

Beale, 28, limped out of Saturday's dramatic 21-20 semi-final win over Leicester with a hamstring injury.
"It doesn't look like it's disastrous but it is a tight turnaround," Wasps director of rugby Dai Young said.
"We're hoping he's going to be right for next week because it'd be fitting for Kurtley to run out at Twickenham."
Australia international Beale only made his Wasps debut in December after spending seven months out with a serious knee injury.
However, he is leaving the club at the end of his one-year deal after being advised to return home if he wants to feature in the 2019 Rugby World Cup.
Wasps secured their place in the Twickenham showpiece thanks to Josh Bassett's late try against Tigers.
Their opponents will be Exeter, who stunned Saracens 18-16 in the other semi-final, and Young said his table-toppers would not underestimate the Chiefs.
He said: "We've got huge respect for Exeter, they're a fantastically-coached team.
"We're all really looking forward to what is going to be a fantastic occasion for everybody at Wasps down at Twickenham next week."
