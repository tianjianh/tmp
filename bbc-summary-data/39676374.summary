Motherwell 2-3 Dundee

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Dundee leapfrogged Motherwell as victory in Neil McCann's first game as manager left the home side in the relegation play-off spot.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Motherwell dominated the first half, but Mark O'Hara put Dundee ahead with their first chance in the final minute.
Marcus Haber swept home the visitors' second before Louis Molt's instant reply, but Haber claimed Dundee's third after O'Hara met Craig Wighton's cross.
Chris Cadden gave Well hope with 10 minutes left, but Dundee held on.
Victory at Fir Park meant they ended a run of seven straight defeats, which cost former manager Paul Hartley his job.
They also moved above Hamilton - beaten 2-0 by Kilmarnock - into ninth place, eight points clear of bottom side Inverness.
The last time Dundee visited Fir Park back in late February, they left Lanarkshire with a 5-1 win.
But the change in fortunes at Dens Park since that day - with only two goals in those past seven matches - resulted in a change of manager.
Motherwell started like a side buoyed by their comprehensive win over Inverness in their last league outing.
They stroked the ball around with confidence, dominated the midfield and created several chances but could not convert them.
Moult was his usual lively self but sent a half-volley straight at Scott Bain, the Dundee keeper also scrambling well to keep out a mis-hit Cadden cross.
Just as the first half appeared to be ending goalless, the visitors got the breakthrough against the run of play.
Haber's initial shot was blocked by Craig Samson, but O'Hara was quick to pounce and poke it home.
A mini goal-fest followed early in the second half, Haber extending Dundee's lead from close range after O'Hara's initial effort was blocked.
Moult controlled a corner with his first touch and fired home his 17th goal of the season with his second to pull a goal back for the hosts.
However, O'Hara stooped to meet Wighton's cross with a fabulous diving header, which appeared to touch Haber on the way in.
Dundee set out to defend what they had as Motherwell chased the game.
They thought they had pulled a goal back through Ben Heneghan's header, but referee Steven McLean deemed it had not crossed the line.
Moments later, Cadden did slide in at the back post to give the home side hope.
Despite throwing everything they had at Bain's goal, a leveller eluded the Steelmen, who are right back in the basement battle with four games left.
Motherwell manager Stephen Robinson: "I'm obviously very disappointed. Another incredible decision.
"We've seen it again and it's probably the worst of any of the decisions so far.
"When he [Dundee's Tom Hateley] clears it, his foot is actually in the back of the goal. It's an incredible decision.
"These people have clubs' livelihoods on the line, people's personal livelihoods on the line, and it's incredible that we haven't done anything about it. It should have been 3-3.
"Take that aside, though, and the two goals we lost either side of the first half were from really poor defending.
"We weren't going to go down today and we weren't going to stay up so we are well aware of that. We have to take it for what it is."
Dundee interim manager Neil McCann: "I am very proud of everyone connected with the staff, but especially the players.
"To come away with three points with a team that had lost seven games on the bounce, I couldn't be prouder.
"We knew we could break and get what we wanted. We looked a lot more purposeful going forward in the second half, and we knew Motherwell would put balls into our box, but we were set up for that.
"It was nervous towards the end, but I couldn't be happier. I wanted to take that fear away and it's difficult with a side that has been struggling to find results.
"But it just shows you what is in there and the character they have.
"We have got ourselves into a better position, but that is all. Now we start gearing up for Kilmarnock next week.
"But I am going to enjoy tonight because all the hard work we have done together has got us three points."
