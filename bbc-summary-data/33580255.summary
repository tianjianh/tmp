A Commonwealth Games legacy fund has been set up to encourage exercise among the least active people in Scotland.

The Â£800,000 fund is aimed at Scots who are classed as physically inactive, meaning they do less than 30 minutes of exercise three or four times a week.
About 21% of people fit that category, according to the Scottish government, which has launched the scheme a year after the Glasgow 2014 Games.
Grants of up to Â£70,000 are available to local community projects.
Groups most at risk of being inactive include people with a disability or long-term health conditions, the elderly, teenage girls and some ethnic minority groups.
The scheme is being run by Spirit of 2012, an independent trust and Commonwealth Games legacy partner.
Sport Minister Jamie Hepburn said: "We have always been determined to ensure that the Glasgow 2014 Commonwealth Games will leave a  lasting legacy.
"One of the key parts of that is putting in place long-term changes that will encourage Scotland to be more physically active. Today's announcement adds to the investment and programmes we have put in place.
"We need a culture change where more people understand that being physically active is one of the best things you can do to improve your health and can take action to be more active in their daily lives."
Debbie Lye, chief executive of Spirit of 2012, said: "Events are not a magic wand. Yet, with the right support and investment, they can be the spark to generate change.
"Once the lights go down on the closing ceremony the real work starts. The Commonwealth Games in Glasgow last year were a momentous milestone in the history of a brilliant city, and now it's time to help the legacy live on.
"We were delighted to be asked to work in partnership with the Scottish government to increase levels of physical activity, promoting well-being across Scotland."
