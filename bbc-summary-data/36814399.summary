Westbury cement works chimney set to be demolished

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A 400ft (122m-high) industrial chimney that has dominated the Wiltshire skyline for decades is to be demolished in September, it has been announced.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Westbury cement works were constructed in the early 1960s and mothballed in 2009.
The chimney will be "brought down by controlled explosion" on 18 September at about 06:45 BST, site owners Tarmac said.
The demolition marks the end of over 40 years of cement production at the site.
Jonathan Toyn, from the company, said spectators were being asked to watch the demolition from the White Horse viewing area "rather than watching from nearby footpaths or farmers' fields".
"The White Horse viewing area gives an outstanding view of the whole site and the community will be able to see this much anticipated event safely at a distance," he said.
"The area will also be the only location where Tarmac will provide people with a count-down to the moment of the demolition so they do not miss the spectacular event."
The chimney is just short of the height of the spire at Salisbury Cathedral, which stands at 123m-high (404ft) above ground level.
The cement works are about 1.6km (1 mile) to the north east of Westbury.
