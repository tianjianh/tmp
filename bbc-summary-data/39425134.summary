Samantha Baldwin, 42, from Newark, was last seen in Nottingham city centre on Monday and is believed to be with Louis Madge, 9, and Dylan Madge, 6.
Nottinghamshire Police said they were treating the case as abduction and confirmed Ms Baldwin did not have legal custody of the boys.
Officers urged her to get in touch to confirm she and the boys are safe.
The force said a 62-year-old woman and a 36-year-old woman had been arrested on suspicion of assisting an offender and remain in police custody.
Supt Rich Fretwell said detectives had carried out searches of properties, studied CCTV footage and used number plate recognition technology.
He appealed directly to Ms Baldwin: "Samantha, all we ask is that you please pick up the phone and let us know you and the children are ok and that you are safe.
"Your loved ones are desperately worried and want to hear from you."
He added "thousands of messages" had been received by the force from members of the public over concerns for the family.
Ms Baldwin is described as being 5ft 7ins (1.7m) tall of a slim build with shoulder length, highlighted blonde hair and green/blue eyes.
She was last seen wearing a red knee-length coat, but may have changed her clothing since.
She also has family connections to Lincolnshire and Manchester.
Louis is described as having fair hair, a fair complexion and blue eyes and Dylan has straight dark brown hair, a tanned complexion and brown eyes.
The two boys also use the surname of Taylor, police said.
