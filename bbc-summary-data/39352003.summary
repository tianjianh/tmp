[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Goals from Rhys Browne, Danny Whittaker and Jack Mackreth did the job for the Silkmen, who move to within six points of the top five, with five games left to play.
They needed only 58 seconds to get the ball rolling as Browne drove home from the edge of the area, with Whitaker, Chris Holroyd and John McCombe all having good chances to extend their lead before the break.
Moments after Macclesfield goalkeeper Craig Ross made a double save from Joe Piggot and Yemi Odoubade, the hosts made the game safe with two goals in the final four minutes.
Whittaker finally got on the scoresheet when he converted from the spot in the 86th minute and then Mackreth added a third by finishing a fine counter-attacking move.
