Protests as future of Carmarthenshire schools discussed

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The future of five small schools in Carmarthenshire hangs in the balance, with supporters fighting to save them.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
There are plans to shut Bancffosfelen and Llanedi primary schools with children travelling to other schools.
Officials are also considering closing Llanmiloe, Tremoilet and Laugharne schools, and setting up a new one.
Carmarthenshire council education scrutiny committee voted to visit some of the schools before making any recommendations to the executive board.
School governors at Ysgol Bancffosfelen have called on the council to allow an educational trust to be set up by the community to run the school.
Parents at Llanedi say school numbers are expected to increase with new houses proposed for nearby Hendy and Pontarddulais.
At Wednesday's meeting, councillors requested to see a business plan from the governors of Ysgol Bancffosfelen.
Councillors voted to recommend the closure of Llanmiloe, Tremoilet and Laugharne schools.
Any final decisions will be made by the executive board at a later date.
