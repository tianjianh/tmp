The announcement was made in a video on bass player Brown Mark's Facebook page.
Guitarist Wendy Melvoin said "after spending days together grieving", they had decided to "do some shows".
The band, who disbanded in 1986, had several line-ups, but the concerts are likely to feature Mark, Melvoin, keyboard players Lisa Coleman and Matt Fink and drummer Bobby Z.
While no dates have been announced, Melvoin added: "We'll be there soon."
The Revolution served as Prince's backing band at the launch of his career, although they did not officially receive their name until their appearance in Prince's 1984 film, Purple Rain.
They appeared with Prince on four albums - the Purple Rain soundtrack, Parade, 1999 and Around The World In A Day - and played on some of the star's biggest hits, including When Doves Cry, Let's Go Crazy and Kiss.
The group split in 1986 after the singer's Parade tour.
Prince was found dead in his Paisley Park recording studio last Thursday.
A private memorial service was held for the rock star on Saturday, attended by about 20 of his closest friends and family.
