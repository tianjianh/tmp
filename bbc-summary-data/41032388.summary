Craig Meschede says Glamorgan have the "firepower" to succeed on their first T20 Finals Day for 13 years.

He took 3-17 in his four overs to set up Glamorgan's nine-wicket hammering of Leicestershire in the T20 Blast.
"The guys are really keen to take a step further, it's a big thing for the club and we're really determined," all-rounder Meschede said.
Glamorgan are the second team to reach Finals Day, to be played at Edgbaston on 2 September, after Hampshire.
"I think we've got the firepower, the bowlers and the batters to do it, so I'm looking forward to it," Meschede, a losing finalist with Somerset in 2011, told BBC Wales Sport.
"It can be overwhelming with a big crowd and a lot of pressure on you, but the type of players we have, it certainly suits us and I think we'll do really well.
"It's quite a weird day, playing twice in one day, so it's hard to stay focused and that'll be an important part for us."
Coach Robert Croft was delighted to have overcome the memory of a heavy quarter-final defeat by Yorkshire in 2016, and paid tribute to the memory of Glamorgan's leading wicket-taker Don Shepherd, who died five days previously.
"That was for Shep, the man epitomises what a Glamorgan cricketer should be - tough as granite on the field, smooth as silk off it," said Croft.
"He made Glamorgan Cricket Club what it is today, and his spirit will carry on.
"Twelve months ago we didn't show up and there were a lot of disappointed faces, but the most disappointed were the players.
"Hopefully we've righted that a bit, but we've still got unfinished business which hopefully we'll take care off at Edgbaston."
