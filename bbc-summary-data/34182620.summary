Japan PM Shinzo Abe secures new term as ruling party chief

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has won a second consecutive term as president of the ruling Liberal Democrats' Party (LDP).

Mr Abe had run unopposed after no other candidates managed to gain enough support from within the party to run.
He said he would continue to focus on the economy before Japan's next elections, scheduled for 2018.
Japan has seen a resurgence in nationalism in recent years, in part led by the hawkish Mr Abe.
He has also pushed for a controversial change in military legislation.
Mr Abe previously served as LDP chief and prime minister from 2006 to 2007. The ruling party's leader usually holds the post of prime minister.
His win of a second consecutive term is considered rare as Japanese political parties often change their leaders. Japan's Kyodo news agency said no LDP leader had been returned unopposed since 1997.
New laws that would allow Japanese troops to fight abroad for the first time since World War Two have been passed by Japan's lower house and is expected to be endorsed by the upper chamber soon.
The move has been vigorously protested, with thousands holding a demonstration two weekends ago outside of parliament.
Mr Abe has also come fire for his economic policy, also known as Abenomics, which initially worked in jumpstarting the economy but later faltered.
He pledged before Tuesday's vote that he would "spread the feeling of recovery to every nook and cranny of the regions and throughout the country, completely escape deflation and create growth in a strong, future-oriented economy".
