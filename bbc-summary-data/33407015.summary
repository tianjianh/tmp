A Royal Marines cadet instructor who tried to help save the life of a man who was struck by lightning on the Brecon Beacons said weather conditions had been "pretty intense".

Two men died and two others are in hospital after the incident on Sunday.
James Nunn was training in the beacons when the lightning struck and said it was like "something out of a movie".
He spent 45 minutes helping a woman try to resuscitate one of the causalities in on Cron Du.
Mr Nunn told BBC Wales how he was training in the beacons to raise money for his unit, the Windsor and Eton Sea Cadets, when the weather "turned very bad".
"As we were climbing up we heard the lightning strike the top of the mountain," he said.
"I saw the flash but not the bolt. We kept going to get to the top.
"We ended up climbing over the top and that's when we saw the colleague of the gentleman. She was attempting to resuscitate him.
"We rushed over and helped out. We carried out resuscitation for around 45 minutes until mountain rescue arrived.
"They worked on him and gave him some adrenalin.
"The conditions were bad. You couldn't see much up there.
"Just heading up the mountain was pretty intense. It was like something out of a movie. It was a peaceful day at the bottom."
Four mountain rescue teams were called to separate incidents at the summits of Corn Du and Cribyn on Sunday.
One person is being treated at Swansea's Morriston Hospital for burns. The other is at Prince Charles Hospital in Merthyr Tydfil.
Meanwhile, a BBC reporter has told how he was knocked unconscious by lightning while walking nearby 25 years ago.
Julian Fowler, a reporter for BBC Northern Ireland, said he and four friends were knocked out by lightning while climbing Pen y Fan 25 years ago.
He told BBC Radio Wales's Jason Mohammad programme how the weather conditions changed to a hail storm from a "beautiful, sunny, warm day".
"We were very lucky," he said.
"Within a week or two the burns on our legs and our feet recovered."
