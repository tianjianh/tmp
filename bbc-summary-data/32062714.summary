The band performed on Wednesday night in Indonesia as news of their bandmate's decision to quit was still breaking around the world.
Harry walked around on stage, head in hands as he started to cry.
A statement released by Zayn Malik on Wednesday said "it's time for me to leave".
It began: "My life with One Direction has been more than I could ever have imagined.
"But, after five years, I feel like it is now the right time for me to leave the band. I'd like to apologise to the fans if I've let anyone down, but I have to do what feels right in my heart.
"I am leaving because I want to be a normal 22-year-old who is able to relax and have some private time out of the spotlight.
"I know I have four friends for life in Louis, Liam, Harry and Niall. I know they will continue to be the best band in the world."
The footage of Harry was taken as the band performed on stage in Indonesia's capital Jakarta, the latest stop on their On The Road Again Tour.
Last week it was announced Zayn had been signed off from the current tour with "stress".
It is unclear from the footage whether Harry, 21, was crying because of the news of Zayn or because fans were showing support by shouting his name.
At one point in the concert Liam Payne reportedly comforted him.
In a black T-shirt and with his hair up in his trademark man bun, Harry wandered around the stage with his head in his hands and wiping away tears.
Liam Payne told his 19.7 million Twitter followers: "So glad to be in bed after a long and strange 24 hours."
Bandmate Harry Styles sent a simple message to his 24.1 million Twitter followers, which read: "All the love as always. H."
Louis Tomlinson has also tweeted: "Your support has been incredible , truly incredible so thank you so much!
"Been a crazy couple of days but know that we are going to work harder than ever to deliver the best album we've ever made for you guys!"
Niall Horan was the last to tweet. He said: "Been a mad few days and your support has been incredible as per usual ! This in turn Spurs us on to make the best music we possibly can.
"Put on great shows / tours for you guys. You are the best fans in the world and you deserve nothing less from us!
"The lads and I arrived in South Africa this morning . We cannot wait to see all you SA fans for the first time and have great shows."
It's not the first time Harry has appeared to cry on stage.
Footage showed him snivelling at a gig in Melbourne, Australia, in 2013 while singing Over Again.
The band, minus Zayn, released a statement on Wednesday confirming to fans that the band would continue as a four-piece.
They will record their fifth album in Zayn's absence and will continue with the remaining dates on the band's world tour.
They were offered words of comfort from Take That's Gary Barlow.
Take That went from a five-piece to a four-piece in 1996 after Robbie Williams left to go solo.
Jason Orange also left the group last year.
Barlow tweeted: "Sending my best to all the 1D boys ! #thatters we've all been there haven't we ? !!!!!"
Cowell's fellow X Factor judge Louis Walsh said he'd heard rumours for a number of weeks that "everything wasn't happy in paradise".
He told Irish radio station RTE Radio One: "The problem with these guys is they've been in a bubble for the last five years, pressure, working, a lot harder than people think, so something had to give.
"So Zayn was the first person just to crack up a little bit."
