Uber avoids car pick-up app restrictions in London

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
London's transport authority has rejected proposals that would have severely restricted Uber and other app-focused car pick-up services.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The California-based private-hire company had urged its users to oppose suggestions that had included a ban on apps being able to show where their nearby available vehicles were.
The idea had been put forward following complaints from black-cab drivers about "unfair competition".
Uber has celebrated the "victory".
However, the Licensed Taxi Drivers Association (LTDA) said there had been a "missed opportunity".
Other rejected measures included:
Uber's drivers may still be inconvenienced by a new proposal.
The Mayor, Boris Johnson, has asked Transport for London (TfL) to investigate whether all private-hire drivers should lose their exemption from the city's congestion-charge scheme.
That would mean they would have to pay Â£11.50 to drive in a central zone on weekdays.
TfL launched a public consultation into the private hire trade last September.
It said it received 16,000 responses.
The organisation still plans to adopt some of the other proposals it made including:
TfL said a final decision on the proposed changes would be made on 17 March.
Uber now has more than 25,000 drivers using its service in London, roughly matching the number of black-cab drivers.
"We're pleased Transport for London has listened to the views of passengers and drivers, dropping the bonkers ideas proposed last year like compulsory five minute wait times and banning showing cars in apps," said a spokesman for the app.
"It means Uber can continue to keep London moving with a convenient, safe and affordable ride at the push of a button."
However, a spokesman for black-cab drivers had mixed feelings.
"There are 93,000 private hire vehicles at the moment and that's soon to be 120,000," Steve McNamara, LTDA's general secretary, told the BBC.
"They are a major contributor to congestion, so it's good common sense that they should have their exemption from the charging zone removed.
"But what's happened [with the dropped proposals] is that Uber's power in Whitehall, Downing Street and beyond has put enormous pressure on Transport for London, and we've seen TfL's genuine desire to regulate private hire vehicles curtailed by the political pressure put upon it."
Taxi drivers are not, however, giving up their fight.
Some of them are organising a crowdfunding campaign to pay for a legal case that they hope will result in Uber's London licence being withdrawn.
The effort has raised just over Â£48,000 of its Â£600,000 target so far.
