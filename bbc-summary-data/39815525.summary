The 22-year-old wrote in an Instagram post: "What doesn't kill you makes you stronger! Back on the board soon."
Daley last competed at a Diving World Series event in Canada in April.
He is next due to compete at the British Championships in Edinburgh in June, before the World Championships in Budapest in July.
Daley's bronze in the 10m platform in Windsor, Canada meant he finished third overall in the four-leg World Series, with three bronzes and a silver.
Jack Laugher won 3m springboard gold to finish second overall, while fellow Britons Tonia Couch and Lois Toulson won bronze in the women's 10m synchro for fourth overall.
