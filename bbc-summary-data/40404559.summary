Bagasan Graham: Ebbsfleet United sign Chelmsford City winger

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Newly-promoted National League side Ebbsfleet have signed winger Bagasan Graham from Chelmsford City.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Former QPR trainee Graham scored in Chelmsford's 2-1 defeat by the Fleet in the National League South play-off final last season.
The 24-year-old joined Chelmsford in August 2015, after a spell with seventh-tier side Dulwich Hamlet.
Meanwhile, Ebbsfleet striker Aaron McLean, 34, has signed a new one-year deal at the club.
McLean scored four goals in 13 games last season, having missed several months with a torn anterior cruciate ligament.
