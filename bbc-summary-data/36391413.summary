The funds raised between 22 April and 12 May, published by the Electoral Commission, were more than twice that declared by their Remain rivals.
Britain Stronger In Europe, which raised £1,044,476, said this exposed Vote Leave's "hypocrisy" in "their claims about 'the establishment'".
Vote Leave said: "The financial support for 'Project Fear' is collapsing."
Campaigners on both sides must publish any donations and loans received worth more than £7,500 in four pre-referendum reports from 1 February to the eve of the vote - 22 June 2016.
In the latest report, for the three weeks to 12 May, the bulk declared was in donations - with just one loan, of £10,000, received from the EU Referendum Campaign Ltd.
Campaigners for the UK to leave the EU declared £3,781,343, of which £3,355,000 was for the designated lead campaign, Vote Leave.
The biggest single donation was £850,000 from International Motors Ltd.
The various campaigns for the UK to remain in the EU collectively declared £1,573,402 over the same period, the bulk of which was raised by Britain Stronger In Europe.
Its largest donations were both for £250,000, one from the Bet365 group and one from Mark Coombs.
The group said it had received an "excellent response from across the UK", with more than 13,000 donations of £50 or less.
But it said the difference in amounts raised "highlights the hypocrisy of the deep-pocketed Leave campaigns and their claims about 'the establishment', which will ring increasingly hollow as it becomes apparent how well-funded they are".
Vote Leave has said it is in a "David and Goliath" fight against the Remain camp - pointing to banks such as Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan that have funded the campaign.
It has also accused Ryanair of breaking electoral law in its pro-EU campaign.
On Thursday, a spokesman for Vote Leave said the Remain campaign could "still rely on the big banks to fill their coffers" but the public were being "turned off by a campaign to do down the British economy".
"The fact that funding is drying up for the In campaign shows that the financial support for 'Project Fear' is collapsing," the Vote Leave spokesman said.
