Johns, 24, made a winning start in the UFC with a unanimous decision win over South Korea's Kwan Ho Kwak in November.
Entwistle has fought three times in the UFC, winning once.
UFC London will be at the O2 Arena on 18 March.
"Stylistically it is a match up I like, I feel very confident with this fight," Johns told BBC Wales Sport.
"He has one real major tool which he uses a lot which is the foot blocks, and one of his favourite moves is the heel hook which does damage to the ligaments and the knee.
"I am looking at maybe keeping the fight on the feet and trying to use my boxing to get the win.
"I want to go out there and put a good performance on, and for me personally it is the win that counts and I will do anything to get that win."
