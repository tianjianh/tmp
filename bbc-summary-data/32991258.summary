[SN]TITLE[SN]
Antrim: Man given 14-year sentence for rape of partner's daughter

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A 26-year-old man has been sentenced to 14 years for raping his partner's four-year-old daughter.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Her mother, 27, was given a nine-month suspended sentenced for initially lying about how her daughter was injured.
The pair, who have since separated, cannot be named to protect the identity of the child.
The attack happened in the home they shared in County Antrim in November 2013 while the girl's mother was at an evening class.
The judge at Antrim crown court said that despite being found guilty by a jury the man continued to deny the offence.
He said this was an aggregating factor in determining the sentence.
The judge said the girl's injuries were not accidental and the man's sentence reflected his lack of remorse.
He will serve a minimum of seven years in prison with the remainder on licence.
The judge requested a further three years be added to his licence period to protect the public from "a high-risk reoffender".
