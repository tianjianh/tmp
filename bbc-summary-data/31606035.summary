People are being invited to give their views on Gloucestershire hospitals at two events, ahead of an inspection.

The events are being held in Cheltenham and Gloucester later to hear people's experiences of care in the last year.
England's chief inspector of hospitals said views expressed would help inspectors decide what to look at.
Gloucestershire Hospitals NHS Trust will be inspected on 10 March and given an overall rating under changes by the Care Quality Commission.
The chief inspector, Prof Sir Mike Richards, announced last year he would lead significantly larger inspection teams than before, headed up by clinical and other experts including trained members of the public.
He said: "The new inspections are designed to provide people with a clear picture of the quality of the services in their local hospital, exposing poor or mediocre care as well as highlighting the many hospitals providing good and excellent care.
"Of course we will be talking to doctors and nurses, hospital managers and patients at the trust. But it is vital that we also hear the views of the people who have received care at the trust, or anyone who wants to share information with us.
"This will help us plan our inspection, and so help us focus on the things that really matter to people who depend on this service."
The inspectors are holding "listening" events for the public to share their experiences at Hotel Mercure Cheltenham Queens at 15:30 and New County Hotel, in Gloucester, at 18:00.
