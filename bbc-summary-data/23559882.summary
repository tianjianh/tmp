[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Eight years after a young mother was shot dead when three men burst into her home in Liverpool, police have made a fresh appeal to find her killers.

Lucy Hargreaves, who would be 30 this year, was killed at her house in Lambourne Road, Walton, on 3 August 2005.
The men set fire to the house but her partner and toddler daughter escaped.
Police are searching for suspect Kevin Thomas Parle, 31, who they believe is living in Europe.
He is also wanted over the murder of 16-year-old Liam Kelly, who was murdered in the early hours of 19 June 2004 as he got out of a car in Grafton Street, Dingle.
Ms Hargreaves was lying on the sofa when she was shot, as her partner Gary Campbell and two-year-old daughter slept upstairs.
Detective Superintendent Dave Brunskill said: "Even as a toddler was heard crying upstairs, the offender poured petrol around the living room and hallway and set fire to the house.
"Their callous actions would have claimed the lives of two more people that night had Gary not escaped the flames by jumping with his daughter.
"Eight years on we are determined to bring Lucy Hargreaves' killers to justice.
"Lucy was an innocent victim and this year her family should have been celebrating her 30th birthday with her - instead they have been robbed of a loving mother and daughter.
"It's never too late to come forward with information - we believe someone, somewhere knows what has happened to Lucy and I hope that the passing of time will enable people to search their consciences and find the courage to come forward.
"I'd like to reassure them that there are special measures that can be put in place to protect witnesses in serious cases such as this."
Two men were cleared of Ms Hargreaves' murder in a trial in 2007.
