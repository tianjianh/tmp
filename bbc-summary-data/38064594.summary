SCX made the first roof in 2009 to allow all-weather play on Centre Court.
Fabrication work for the Number One Court roof is about to start and it is expected to be completed in time for the 2019 championships.
The cost of the project, which includes expanding the seating capacity, has not been disclosed.

The new roof will be a concertina design made of transparent fabric stretched between steel trusses.
The structure will weigh 1,100 tonnes and cover an area of 5,500mÂ².  It will be able to be deployed or retracted in around eight minutes.
The company said it would use local suppliers whenever possible.
SCX managing director Simon Eastwood said: "Wimbledon is the world's greatest tennis tournament and we are incredibly proud to be part of the work on Number One Court.
"Our technical innovation and engineering expertise helped us to produce a highly successful retractable roof for Centre Court and we expect this project to be just as successful."
