[SN]TITLE[SN]
Colchester United 2-2 Morecambe

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Morecambe substitute Lee Molyneux scored a late equaliser and earned his side a deserved 2-2 draw at Colchester.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Morecambe goalkeeper Barry Roche denied Sammie Szmodics before Colchester took a fourth-minute lead through Chris Porter, who finished from close range following Kane Vincent-Young's precise cross.
Roche then saved Denny Johnstone's header before the visitors missed a 17th-minute penalty when Tom Barkhuizen's spot-kick was saved by Sam Walker after Peter Murphy was fouled by Alex Wynter in the area.
However, Barkhuizen quickly atoned for his penalty miss when he equalised for Morecambe in the 27th minute, converting coolly past Walker after Szmodics had been robbed of possession.
However, Colchester restored their lead seven minutes before the break through Porter, who converted from the spot after Kevin Ellison had handled Richard Brindley's fierce shot in the area.
But Morecambe equalised with 13 minutes remaining when Molyneux's free-kick went through Walker's hands and in.
Colchester substitute Kurtis Guthrie went close to winning it late on but the spoils were shared.
