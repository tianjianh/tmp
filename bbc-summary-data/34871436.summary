[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
John Paul Branniff, 34, of Carnreagh Road in Ballynahinch, was found to have 2,000 tonnes of mixed waste on his land.
It included building materials, plastics, timber, carpet and textiles.
Branniff pleaded guilty to four charges.  It is believed a substantial amount of waste had also been burned on the site.
He will spend half of his 18-month sentence on licence and half in prison.
Mr Branniff had previously been made the subject of a Â£108,350 confiscation order for keeping illegal waste on his land.
He was told to pay that order within three months or face a further two years in jail.
The case was taken by the Northern Ireland Environment Agency.
A spokesperson said the case underlined the "seriousness of waste offending".
"We hope that it also represents both a suitable deterrent to anyone who may be contemplating such activity and a demonstration to the public of our intention to actively pursue anyone who seeks to profit from the destruction of our environment," the spokesperson said.
