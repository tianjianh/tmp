Republic of Ireland manager Martin O'Neill said he is "fine" after returning to the training ground hours after being involved in a car crash.

O'Neill, his assistant Roy Keane and three other management team members suffered minor injuries after Tuesday's incident on the M50 motorway in Dublin.
"We're fine, we're fine, I'll survive anyway," said O'Neill, 63.
All five were present at Wednesday's training session before Saturday's Euro 2016 qualifier with Scotland.
O'Neill's coaches Steve Walford, Steve Guppy and Seamus McDonagh were also in the car on Tuesday.
They were treated by team doctor Alan Byrne, and were back on the training pitch at Gannon Park in Malahide as the Republic stepped up preparations for Saturday's vital tie.
"We just got shunted from the back," O'Neill said.
"I speak for myself, but I'm feeling not too bad."
Asked if the incident had been scary, O'Neill added after a pause: "Yeah, but listen, we're fine."
Team captain Robbie Keane, who flew into Dublin after playing for club LA Galaxy on Saturday evening, trained with his team-mates, as did defender John O'Shea, who complained of a tight calf muscle in the wake of Sunday's 0-0 friendly draw with England.
"Keane had a long flight and I don't think he was expecting to play the full game, but he stayed on the field as they were losing.
"But he's feeling not so bad now. It might take him a day to get sorted out, but he's not too bad.
"John trained this morning, which is great, and he's feeling much, much better. He felt a bit uncomfortable on Monday, but he trained and he's okay."
However, there is less encouraging news for midfielder Harry Arter, who is a doubt for the weekend as he has hip and groin injuries, which he suffered during his debut as a substitute on Sunday.
