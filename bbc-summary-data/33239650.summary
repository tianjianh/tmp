SAS selection deaths: Soldier denies 'paperwork' excuse

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A soldier has denied saying a fatal SAS selection exercise march was not cancelled because it would have been "too much paperwork".

L/Cpl Craig Roberts, from Conwy county, died during the Brecon Beacons march on one of the hottest days of 2013.
L/Cpl Edward Maher and Cpl James Dunsby also collapsed and later died.
At their inquest on Tuesday, an SAS soldier rejected claims he told L/Cpl Roberts's family the march went ahead "to save on paperwork".
Coroner Louise Hunt has previously heard the family say the commanding officer, known as 9L, offered the response when asked why the date of the march was not changed.
"Those aren't the words that I recollect," he told the hearing in Solihull, West Midlands.
The soldier said his unit was "deeply shocked" and "deeply sorry" about the reservists' deaths.
However, he added: "I think it's fair to say we could not have seen this accident beforehand, if we could, we would have made changes."
Earlier, the soldier, who was in charge of monitoring and logging the participants' movements using GPS trackers, denied falsifying records.
Soldier 1C said his written log was handed over to special forces officials immediately after the march and stored at its headquarters in Hereford, Herefordshire.
When asked by the coroner if he had "created" handwritten timings after the tragic events to clarify what happened, he replied: "No, ma'am. This list was produced on the day when those times were."
The inquest heard each participant had a tracker which sent co-ordinates, or "pinged", back to a satellite every 10 minutes. These then appeared on a laptop.
Soldier 1C said he "can't remember" if a "slow-mover" alarm, which flags up when soldiers are stationary, was activated that day.
A map tracking the movements of L/Cpl Maher showed he became static at 14:16 BST, while soldier 1C said he had not noticed until 16:40.
"I can't concentrate on one specific student because we've got other students that are tired, fatigued, that I've got to keep an eye on too.
"The only thing I can say is we were sat watching the rest of the students," he added.
Soldier 1C told the hearing that directing staff had not said anyone was "under any duress".
The inquest also heard Cpl Dunsby's lack of movement went unnoticed for one hour and 23 minutes.
Soldier 1C said he had been monitoring the screen, with breaks, for nine hours, but pointed out he had previously undertaken 36-hour shifts while on operational duty.
L/Cpl Roberts, 24, from Penrhyn Bay, L/Cpl Maher, 31, from Winchester, Hampshire, and Cpl Dunsby, 31, from Trowbridge, Wiltshire, were carrying 50lbs (22kg) of equipment during the fatal march.
The inquest continues.
