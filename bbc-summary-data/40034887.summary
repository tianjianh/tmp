The Red Devils also completed a clean sweep of major trophies as goals from Paul Pogba and Henrikh Mkhitaryan won an emotional final in Stockholm.
BBC chief football writer Phil McNulty rates the performances of the United players.
Had one simple shot to field in the first half but otherwise an untroubled night.
Solid defensively and an attacking threat from the man who started the night as captain.
Got the nod over Phil Jones and did what he had to do.
One of two crucial clearances but not a testing 90 minutes.
Solid, dependable and never in any difficulty.
Usual threat in the air helped create United's second goal and also ensured they overpowered Ajax in midfield.
Excellent display from United's player of the season but marred by some unnecessary play-acting near the end.
Showed signs of why he is so highly regarded - helped United dominate midfield and scored with a deflected shot.
Busy, inventive and a threat. Now one of Mourinho's trusted men after he was sold by the Portuguese at Chelsea.
Tough first half when committed silly fouls and got booked but demonstrated once more he can be relied upon to score a crucial goal.
Hard night's work for the youngster, who got little joy but never stopped running for a second.
Jesse Lingard (for Mkhitaryan 74 minutes): Looked like he might add to his tally of goals in major finals when he ran clear but was denied by a late tackle.
Anthony Martial (for Rashford 82 minutes): No rating.
Wayne Rooney (for Mata 89 minutes): No rating.
