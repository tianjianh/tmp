Complaints were made to police over Lennon's touchline conduct after Hibs' first goal in a 3-2 victory.
Lennon was criticised by some Rangers fans for "inflammatory" actions following Simon Murray's equaliser.
A 54-year-old man has been arrested in connection with alleged offensive and threatening social media comments relating to Lennon.
The Easter Road boss cupped his ears and made a gesture as he celebrated.
A Police Scotland spokeswoman told the BBC: "Officers reviewed the events at the match and talks with the procurator fiscal established that no criminality took place.
"Therefore no further action will be taken."
Following the match, the Northern Irishman insisted he had no concerns about his behaviour.
When it was suggested Rangers assistant manager Helder Baptista had spoken to police about Lennon, he said: "I didn't make a gesture, I celebrated a goal.
"If they are unhappy about it they can come and tell me. But I shouldn't get into trouble for doing that.
"I am celebrating a goal. What way are you supposed to celebrate a goal?"
