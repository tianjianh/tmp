The 18-year-old moves back to the National League side, having previously played for the club's under-15s.
Phipps made his first-team debut for Margate in February and established himself as a regular this season.
Maidstone boss Jay Saunders said: "He is a good size, good in the air and in the tackle - like a good old fashioned midfielder with a little more ability."
