In a race involving sprinters from all disability classes, Smyth triumphed in 10.73 seconds ahead of USA's Richard Browne and Brazil's Petrucio Ferreira.
The race was part of a festival to mark one year to the 2016 Paralympic Games.
"I am very pleased with the result and even more so because so many people came to watch," Smyth said.
The four-time Paralympic gold medallist, who holds the 100m world record of 10.46 seconds in the T13 class for visually impaired athletes, said the race augured well for next year.
"It was fantastic. The event was very well organised and I'm sure that Rio is on the right track for next year."
The Eglinton sprinter, 28, will aim to defend the 100m and 200m gold medals he won in Beijing 2008 and London 2012 in Rio next year.
