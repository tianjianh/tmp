Women's Super League One: Chelsea Ladies 1-2 Arsenal Ladies

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Danielle van de Donk's late winner dented Chelsea Ladies' title hopes and kept Arsenal third in Women's Super League One.

The Blues were gifted an early lead through Alex Scott's 40-yard own goal.
Arsenal levelled just before half-time through Vicky Losada's glancing header from a corner.
Moments after Claire Rafferty had missed from five yards for Chelsea, Van de Donk calmly rounded Hedvig Lindahl to win against the run of play.
Second-placed Chelsea remain one point behind leaders Manchester City Women, who now have a game in hand.
The hosts had struck the woodwork through Eniola Aluko's fierce strike after Ji So-yun was denied from close range in the second half.
And Rafferty had the best chance to put them ahead on 83 minutes, but lost her footing in front of goal.
The game had started embarrassingly for the Gunners, as captain Scott, unchallenged in the right-back position, passed back to Netherlands keeper Sari van Veenendaal, who misjudged the ball's pace and direction as it bounced past her into the net.
But the Women's FA Cup winners, now unbeaten in eight games in all competitions since losing 2-0 at home to Chelsea in the reverse fixture, are now just two points behind their London rivals.
Chelsea defender Hannah Blundell:
"We know we're struggling in front of goal, we can't deny that, but we just need to make sure we turn up at the back, which is obviously what's cost us as well.
"I do think that, once we get our confidence back, the goals will start coming."
Arsenal midfielder Danielle van de Donk:
"At the end they had a lot of chances so I think we were lucky to win, but in sport you have luck sometimes and I think we earned it today.
"It's going to be hard [to catch Man City], but maybe Champions League, that's what we're aiming for and we just want to get as high as we can in the table and that's it."
