One of them is Carmen Blandin Tarleton, a nurse from the US who was attacked by her estranged husband.
She was left with 80% burns after he doused her with industrial-strength detergent. Doctors described it as "the most horrific injury a human being could suffer".
By the time she was on the list for a face transplant, she had been in surgery 58 times. Two years ago she had 17 hours of surgery to get a new face, only the seventh person in the US to do so. She spoke to  BBC Newsnight's Kirsty Wark.
