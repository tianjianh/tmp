EU referendum: Iain Duncan Smith 'troubled' by Remain conduct

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The "acrimonious" conduct of the UK's EU Remain campaign risks damaging the government beyond the June referendum, Iain Duncan Smith has warned.

Writing in the Daily Mail, the pro-exit work and pensions secretary said he had found its conduct "troubling".
He said those making "desperate and unsubstantiated" claims about EU exit risked damaging their own integrity.
Number 10 refused to comment, but Prime Minister David Cameron has previously called for a respectful debate.
The government's official position is in support of staying in a reformed EU under the "special status" Mr Cameron says he secured for the UK in his EU renegotiation.
Mr Cameron and other leading figures in the Remain campaign have warned that to quit the EU would be a "leap in the dark" and endanger Britain's economy and national security.
But in the Mail, Mr Duncan Smith, a former leader of the Conservative Party, said the In camp was basing its campaign on "spin, smears and threats" to try to "bully" Britons into voting to stay.
"The acrimonious manner in which all this has been conducted is troubling, and will I fear have consequences long beyond 23 June," he said.
"After all, such desperate and unsubstantiated claims are now being made that they begin to damage the very integrity of those who make them in the eyes of the public."
BBC political correspondent Alex Forsyth says this is the strongest intervention yet from Mr Duncan Smith and will be seen as implicit criticism of the prime minister and his allies.
Mr Duncan Smith said a "series of highly questionable dossiers" had been produced by the Remain campaign, "threatening almost biblical consequences if we dare to consider a future outside the EU".
He said the campaign had shifted the debate away from the merits of Mr Cameron's deal struck in Brussels to "scaremongering" about whether the UK can stand alone.
"The question being asked seems to be whether we could cope on our own at all. Why they would seek to present our country, and themselves, as so weak is beyond me."
It was "vital", he said, that the debate was conducted in "a respectful manner, where we maturely interrogate the issues".
Cabinet ministers have been allowed to campaign on either side of the debate and five of them, including Mr Duncan Smith, are pushing for an EU exit.
About half of the party's MPs - most notably London mayor Boris Johnson - are also supporting a vote to leave.
Mr Duncan Smith's warning comes a day after Mr Cameron held a summit with French President Francois Hollande in northern France.
Mr Hollande said he wanted the UK to stay in the EU - and warned there would be "consequences" for  immigration and the economy if it left.
French economy minister Emmanuel Macron earlier suggested his country could end UK border controls in Calais.
Asked whether he would do this, Mr Hollande said: "I don't want to scare you, I just want to say the truth - there will be consequences."
Mr Cameron, who said the UK would be "better off... stronger" inside a "reformed" EU, announced Â£17m to help the French authorities deal with migrants attempting to get into the UK from Calais and Dunkirk.
Leave campaigners have dismissed the Calais claims as "scaremongering".
