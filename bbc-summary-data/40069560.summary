Portsmouth are in talks with manager Paul Cook to remain with them after he received an offer from Wigan, reports BBC Radio Solent.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Former Latics midfielder Cook, 50, had been keen to talk to Wigan about their managerial vacancy.
Cook moved to Fratton Park from Chesterfield in May 2015 and led Pompey to the League Two title this season.
It is understood any exit would not be linked to Walt Disney chief executive Michael Eisner's takeover of the club.
Graham Barrow has been interim manager of Wigan since March when Warren Joyce left after four months in charge, but could not save them from relegation from the Championship.
Kirkby-born Cook played for Wigan between 1984 and 1988 before a brief loan spell back at the club in the 2001-02 season.
