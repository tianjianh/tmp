A former detective says a double-murderer he arrested may be linked to missing York chef Claudia Lawrence.

Christopher Halliwell was jailed on Friday for the 2003 murder of Becky Godden, having already been convicted of killing Sian O'Callaghan in 2011.
Ex-detective Steve Fulcher told the Sunday Express Ms Lawrence's case fitted Halliwell's behaviour.
But North Yorkshire Police said they are "not aware" of any evidence to link Halliwell to Ms Lawrence.
She vanished in York in March 2009.
Mr Fulcher told the Sunday Express: "Halliwell's father lived a few streets away from where Claudia went missing.
"It fits his pattern of behaviour - abducting women walking alone either late at night or early in the morning."
Mr Fulcher resigned from Wiltshire Police in 2014 after being found guilty of gross misconduct for failing to follow the proper procedures when arresting Halliwell in 2011.
The 52-year-old taxi driver from Swindon was jailed for life in 2011 for killing Ms O'Callaghan, whose body was found in Uffington, Oxfordshire.
Becky Godden's remains were also discovered in 2011, in a field in Eastleach, Gloucestershire.
Ms Lawrence was last seen on 18 March 2009 and was reported missing the following day after she failed to turn up for work at the University of York.
North Yorkshire Police believe the 35-year-old was murdered, although no body has ever been discovered.
Following Mr Fulcher's claims in the Sunday Express, a spokesman for the force said: "The investigation team is aware of this matter and they will carefully assess the information in line with the on-going review of the Claudia Lawrence case.
"However, to be clear, the team is not aware of any evidence that would link this individual [Halliwell] to the disappearance and suspected murder of Claudia."
Martin Dales, friend and spokesman of Miss Lawrence's father Peter, said the claim should be investigated.
He said: "I think the retired officer in question has a detailed knowledge of things. The overriding point is really whoever has done whatever to Claudia, it has been an incredibly long time."
