Premier League predictions: Lawro v The National

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
BBC Sport's football expert Mark Lawrenson is pitting his wits against a different guest each week this season.

This week he takes on twin brothers Aaron & Bryce Dessner from US rock band The National.

The Dessners hail from Cincinnati but have always been football fans, with Bryce telling BBC Sport: "We grew up playing soccer and we we were really into it as kids. We were captains of our high school teams.
Aaron added: "We were decent by American standards, which means not very good at all. But we have always followed the Premier League.
"My wife is Danish and her family are long-time Liverpool supporters so I am a Liverpool fan by default. But like a lot of Americans we follow the teams that have American players, so we love Tim Howard at Everton for example."
A correct result is worth ONE point. A correct score earns THREE points.
Last week, Lawro got four results right, with one perfect score. His score of six gave him victory over actor and comedian David Schneider, who got two correct results, with no exact scores.
