More than 160 lots, many of which were donated by some of the biggest names in word football, were sold.
A Chelsea shirt signed by Jose Mourinho fetched £2,550 while a trip to watch Barcelona train sold for £3,550.
The money will be split between several charities including the Sir Bobby Robson Foundation.
This was the fourth Sir Bobby Auction organised by his friend Gina Long and more than £870,000 has now been raised for charities.
Ms Long, a charity fundraiser from Suffolk, said: "Sir Bobby was a colossal global figure in football and the love and respect people still have for him has been reflected in the unbelievable money-can't-buy prizes that we have been fortunate to receive."
Sir Bobby's former clubs Barcelona, PSV Eindhoven, Newcastle United and Ipswich Town all gave support and there were personal donations from Wayne Rooney, Theo Walcott, Frank Lampard, Aaron Ramsey,  Terry Butcher, Kevin Beattie, Sir Alex Ferguson, Andre Villas-Boas and Jose Mourinho.
An England shirt signed by Rooney sold for £1,820, two pictures of the Beatles fetched a total of £1,030 and a "once in a lifetime" Russian football experience donated by Zenit Saint Petersburg manager Andre Villas-Boas went for £2,050.
Former Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson donated a signed sketchbook of the team's memorable moments which sold for £2,550.
Sir Bobby's Online Auction raised money for the Sir Bobby Robson Foundation, In The Game - the League Managers Association Charity, the GeeWizz charitable foundation and West Suffolk Hospital Charity.
Sir Bobby managed Fulham, Ipswich Town, PSV Eindhoven (twice), Sporting Lisbon, Porto, Barcelona and Newcastle United. He also led England to the 1990 World Cup semi-final.
His death from cancer in 2009 sparked tributes from across the sporting world.
