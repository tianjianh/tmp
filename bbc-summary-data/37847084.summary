Carolyn Harris's son Martin died in a road accident in Swansea in 1989.  A whip-round among friends raised Â£1,000 from friends but the Swansea East MP had to take out a bank loan to pay for the rest of the funeral.
Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn asked Theresa May to tell councils to scrap charges for the burial of infants.
The prime minister said help was available through a social fund for funerals.
