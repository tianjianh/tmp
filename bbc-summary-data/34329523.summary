"I know that Star Wars fans are hardcore and I'm very excited to be part of this great franchise," Del Toro told the BBC.

"I haven't started it put it together. I'll build it with the director.  I don't like to talk about things until they're done. I almost feel like you jinx it. Walk the walk and then talk the talk.
"But walk the walk first."
