People in the Lansdown area are affected and police said up to 1,000 properties may have to be vacated.
Residents are being moved to Bath Racecourse, and a 300m exclusion zone has been set up at Royal High School.
Avon and Somerset Police said the situation would not be resolved quickly.
The force's bomb squad is currently assessing the situation at the school.

It's here at Bath racecourse where people are being evacuated to, if they want it. Some are staying with friends and family.
The cordon is near the centre of Bath on the Lansdown Road at the old High School. Some will know it locally as the old Hope House.
It's there that the bomb squad were called after builders who are developing the site found a 500lb World War Two bomb.
I'm told it is a metre down and it is where what was, until a few years ago, a playground. They are currently working on defusing that bomb.
A spokesman for the force said officers were called to the school at about 16:40 BST.
He added: "We are working closely with our partner agencies to limit the disruption caused."
Road closures have been put in place and motorists were being advised to find alternative routes.
Insp Gavin Usher thanked residents for their patience during the disruption.
"Decisions to evacuate houses are never taken lightly but during these incidents public safety will always be our primary concern," he said.
