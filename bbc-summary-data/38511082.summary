Rochdale goalkeeper Conrad Logan has signed a new deal until the end of the season with the League One side.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 30-year-old former Republic of Ireland youth international returned to Dale last summer after he was released by Leicester City.
He made 25 appearances on loan at Dale in 2014, and his previous contract had been due to expire next week.
"I enjoyed it when I was here previously and I've really enjoyed it since I've been back," he said.
