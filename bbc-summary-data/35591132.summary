[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Benjamin Hyland-Ward faces nine counts of fraud by false representation in connection with selling tickets.
The 18-year-old, of Westfield Avenue South, Saltdean, East Sussex, is due to appear before Brighton Magistrates' Court on 24 March.
Hundreds of people were left ticket-less after paying to go to the event last September.
Sussex Police said the charges incorporated all of the reports of money being paid for but no tickets being given.
