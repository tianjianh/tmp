New York ports closed after workers protest

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
New York and New Jersey's cargo terminals were shut down on Friday as workers walked off the job.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Over 1,000 workers left their posts, preventing ships from being unloaded.
It is unclear what sparked the action. The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey issued a statement calling for employees to "return to work immediately".
The port is the biggest on the US East Coast. In 2014 over $200bn (Â£140bn) in cargo came through the port.
The International Longshoreman's Association (ILA) which represents the worker was not available for comment. The ILA has clashed with the Port Authority in recent years over hiring practices and policies such as drug testing.
The port employs close to 3,500 longshoremen.
The port- which consists of five container terminals in New York and New Jersey - is the third largest in the US.
Approximately a quarter of US gross domestic product is accounted for within a 250-mile radius of the ports.
