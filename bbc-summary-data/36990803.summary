Tanveer Iqbal: 'Mistress' denies car boot murder

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A spurned mistress conspired with her husband to kill her lover, a court has heard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Zatoon Bibi, 37, and Gul Nawaz, 44, both deny murdering Tanveer Iqbal, whose body was found in a car boot in Birmingham.
At the start of their trial, the city's crown court heard Mr Iqbal, 33, and Mrs Bibi had an "unconventional and complicated relationship" which both their spouses were "fully aware" of.
A 16-year-old boy also denies murder.
The jury was told Mrs Bibi and Mr Iqbal's wife had even met and chatted as "sisters" by text.

However, in August last year Mr Iqbal had banned the pair from contacting one another and he got angry after discovering in January they had continued to talk in secret, the prosecution said.
QC Sally Howes added: "It is clear that in the period leading up to January 31, Zatoon Bibi is stirring up trouble between Mr Iqbal and his wife Nasreen Bibi."
She sent a video to Mrs Iqbal of a sexual nature involving Mr Iqbal.
As a result Mr Iqbal ended his extra-marital affair with Mrs Bibi, said Ms Howes.
The prosecution claims Mrs Bibi lured her former lover to her home in Bridgeburn Road, Birmingham, on 31 January, claiming she had birthday cake for him.
Ms Howes told jurors that CCTV and mobile phone analysis allegedly linked Mrs Bibi and Mr Nawaz to the killing, and the subsequent efforts to move and then abandon the victim's remains.
Mr Iqbal had been strangled to death and the father of two's remains were found crammed into a cardboard box on 2 February.
The box had been wrapped in blue nylon rope and silver gaffer tape.
A 17-year-old girl also appeared in court and pleaded not guilty to perverting the course of justice.
The case continues.
