Marcelo Bielsa: Lazio appoint Argentine as new manager

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Lazio have appointed former Argentina boss Marcelo Bielsa as manager.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 60-year-old Argentine, whose most recent managerial position was in France with Marseille, will start work on 9 July.
Lazio finished eighth in Serie A last season, but had been without a permanent manager since Stefano Pioli was sacked in April.
Bielsa led Argentina to an Olympic gold medal in 2004, before guiding Chile to the 2010 World Cup in South Africa.
He took Athletic Bilbao to the 2012 Europa League and Copa del Rey finals, but had been without a club since leaving Marseille in August 2015.
Bielsa was linked with the Swansea job last year.
