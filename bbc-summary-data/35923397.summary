Pakistani authorities on Tuesday released a video in which the man is shown confessing that he was involved in spying activities.
"There can be no clearer evidence of Indian interference in Pakistan," army spokesman Lt-Gen Asim Bajwa said.
Delhi said the man was an Indian national, but dismissed spying charges and said he was "clearly tutored".
"Government categorically rejects allegations that this individual was involved in subversive activities in Pakistan at our behest," India's foreign ministry spokesperson Vikas Swarup said in a statement to media.
Mr Swarup added that India was "concerned" about the arrested man's well-being and added that "it is also relevant to note here that despite our request, we have not been given consular access to an Indian national under detention in a foreign country, as is the accepted international practice".
Pakistan officials have said the man was a serving Indian navy officer and was trying to "sponsor terrorism" in Balochistan.
"If an intelligence or an armed forces officer of this rank is arrested in another country, it is a big achievement," Lt-Gen Mr Bajwa said.
