The "rare" pot, expected to fetch up to ??3,000, has been owned by a south Shropshire family for at least two generations, Halls auctioneers said.
Alexander Clement, Halls' Asian art specialist, is researching whether it is an Imperial brush pot or a copy.
The cinnabar lacquer pot will be auctioned in Shrewsbury in November.
"The brush pot would have been used to hold brushes used by scribes for Chinese calligraphy and are typically carved with ornate motifs symbolising concepts such as longevity," a spokesman said.
