US rockers All Time Low have topped the UK album chart for the first time, while Jess Glynne has denied Nick Jonas a UK number one for his debut solo single in her third week at the top.

Glynne's track Hold My Hand sold almost 5,000 copies more than Jealous by Jonas, a former member of Disney Channel trio The Jonas Brothers.
The Voice UK winner Stevie McCrorie only made it to number six.
His cover of Adam Levine's Lost Stars had been leading the midweek chart.
However McCrorie, who won the BBC One talent show last weekend after being mentored by the Kaiser Chiefs' Ricky Wilson, is still the programme's highest-charting artist.
He overtakes series two champion Andrea Begley, who reached number 30 in 2013 with her version of Evanescence's My Immortal.
Years & Years' track King, James Bay's Hold Back The River and Ed Sheeran's Bloodstream rounded out the top five singles chart.
Years & Years' former number one single was again the week's most-streamed song, with more than 1.87 million listens.
US pop-punk band All Time Low's chart-topping Future Hearts is their sixth album.
They sold just 278 copies more than their closest rival, Bay's debut album Chaos and the Calm.
"This is a huge surprise! We didn't expect this kind of reaction to the album and we couldn't be happier," said the Baltimore band.
"After so many years together, we never want to let our fans down, and this feels like a massive achievement on their part as much as ours."

Sheeran's X was in third place, with Sam Smith's In the Lonely Hour fourth while last week's number one, The Prodigy's The Day is My Enemy, fell to fifth.
Elsewhere in the album chart Drenge debuted at 14 with their second album Undertow and, after appearing on the final of The Voice, The Script got a boost of 23 places for their album No Sound Without Silence, taking it to number 23.
