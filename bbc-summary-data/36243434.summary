Birmingham City winger David Cotterill is hoping he has done enough to secure his place in Wales' Euro 2016 squad.

Chris Coleman will name a provisional 28-man squad on Monday before a pre-tournament training camp in the Algarve in Portugal begins on 23 May.
Cotterill, 28, scored in Birmingham's 1-1 draw at Cardiff on Saturday, his second goal in three games.
"I've hit form at the right time and hopefully I'll make the squad that goes to the Euros," Cotterill said.
"I want to be in the 23 and first and foremost you've got to be in that initial squad that he's [Coleman] going to name."
Coleman will announce his 23-man squad for the European Championship finals in France on Tuesday, 31 May, with five players cut from the provisional squad.
Forward Gareth Bale missed Real Madrid's crucial La Liga home game against Valencia on Sunday because of a knee strain.
Midfielder Joe Ledley limped off during Crystal Palace's 2-1 win over Stoke City.
There are also concerns over midfielder David Vaughan and defender Adam Mathews, who have been suffering with hamstring injuries.
Vaughan has not featured in Nottingham Forest's last three games while Matthews, on loan from Sunderland, has not played in Bristol City's last two games.
Cotterill started in Wales' 1-1 friendly draw against Northern Ireland on 24 March and was an unused substitute in the 1-0 defeat in Ukraine four days later.
The Cardiff-born player missed two months earlier in the season after suffering a knee injury but has been pleased with his recent performances.
"When I first came back from my injury it took me a while to get going again," Cotterill added.
"It was important that my form was good for Birmingham to give me an opportunity."
Cotterill's Birmingham City manager Gary Rowett believes the former Wigan Athletic and Swansea City player deserves his place in Wales' Euro squad.
"He's probably our most naturally athletic player getting up and down the pitch," Rowett said.
"He's come into tremendous form and been fantastic for us.
"Part of that is his desperation to be in the Wales squad and he's unashamedly told me that. I sincerely hope he does."
