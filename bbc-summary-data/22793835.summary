Over a million people have had to leave the country because of the fierce war between government forces and rebel troops.
In the past, when civil wars have become this bad, western countries have sometimes sent in troops to help end the fighting
But in Syria, it's more complicated and there's now a big debate over the best way to deal with the situation.
The Syrian Government has powerful allies. Russia has sent weapons and equipment to help President Assad's forces.
Western countries like the US and the UK support the other side - the anti-government rebels, and last week a ban was lifted to allow European countries to send arms to help them.
Some people don't think sending weapons is the right way to end the war and sending in troops could lead to other countries who support the Syrian Government sending in troops to defend them.
