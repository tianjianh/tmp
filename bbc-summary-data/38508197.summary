Coventry City supporters blow whistle on their own whistling protest

Coventry City fans have been asked to stop whistling protests at games in the wake of claims that a crowd whistle triggered Bolton's late equaliser in Monday's 2-2 draw at the Ricoh Arena.

City fans have been involved in regular protests against club owners Sisu.
They reached a big live TV audience with mass whistling in the home defeat by Sheffield United in December.
But supporters spokesman Jan Mokrzycki has warned that the whistling may be doing "more harm than good".
Mokrzycki, from the Sky Blue Trust, added: "Whilst to most fair-minded observers the cause of the Bolton equalising goal was simple defender error, some elements are blaming a whistle for causing momentary confusion in City's ranks.
"This form of protest is now doing more harm than good to the protest movement which we are fully behind and the Trust is calling on all supporters to cease the use of whistles at games.
"The Trust continues to fully support the efforts of The Jimmy Hill Way Alliance to rid our club of owners Sisu, fully backs manager Russell Slade and the team and calls for all supporters to unite together behind both the protests and the team - but without the whistles."
Coventry City fans' frustration with their owners has steadily increased since the London-based hedge fund managers first took over the club in 2007.
But protests have become more frequent and varied this season, all to the loud backdrop chants of "We Want Sisu Out" at every game.
