[SN]TITLE[SN]
Challenge Cup: Huddersfield Giants 16-28 Wakefield Wildcats

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Wakefield reached their first Challenge Cup semi-final for eight years by beating Huddersfield in the last eight.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
David Fifita's second-minute try, a Ben Jones-Bishop score and three Liam Finn kicks put Wakefield 14-0 up early on, as Scott Grix and Jake Connor replied.
Tom Johnstone's length-of-the-field effort and prop Fifita's second put Wakefield's victory beyond doubt.
Jermaine McGillvary's two tries were consolations for the struggling hosts, who are still without a head coach.
Wakefield have not appeared in a Challenge Cup final since 1979, but head coach Chris Chester is one win away from a second final in as many seasons, having led Hull KR to Wembley in 2015.
Huddersfield, second from bottom of Super League and under the temporary stewardship of Andy Kelly after sacking Paul Anderson on 16 June, had knocked out holders Leeds Rhinos in the previous round.
Against Wakefield, they were made to pay for poor starts to both halves.
Giants half-back Danny Brough was sent to the sin-bin for a high shot on Reece Lyne during a sloppy opening to the first period, although he returned to set up Connor's first-half score with a jinking run and sharp pass.
That left the hosts only six points behind at the interval, but there was to be no way back for Huddersfield once Grix's loose pass had gifted Johnstone the chance to coast over for his sixth Challenge Cup try of the season.
