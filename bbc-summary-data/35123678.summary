[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man has admitted murdering his neighbour near their homes in Glasgow after a row relating to a dog.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Martin Carroll, 28, stabbed 36-year-old Stephen Gannon in the neck near their tenement block in the city's Springburn area on 14 August.
The High Court in Glasgow heard that the victim died outside his home. Carroll later told his grandmother: "I've done something stupid."
He faces a mandatory life term when he is sentenced at a later date.
The court heard that Mr Gannon lived downstairs from Carroll at the flats in St Monance Street.
Carroll once had a disagreement with another neighbour about her dog misbehaving.
On 14 August, Mr Gannon was chatting to the neighbour who had the dog, inside the tenement when Carroll walked by.
The court heard that Carroll was already wanted by police at the time after failing to turn up for a court hearing in connection with an attack on his mother.
Mr Gannon followed him and shouted: "Don't you be giving abuse to the woman in my close."
Carroll initially ignored the comment - but then turned and confronted his neighbour.
Prosecutor Ross McFarlane said: "In a sudden movement, Carroll produced a large knife and struck out a number of times.
"He stabbed Mr Gannon in the neck area...blood started to spurt from the wound and he tried to run back towards his flat."
The victim collapsed blood-soaked in the street and never recovered from the attack.
An apparently-upset Carroll then appeared at his grandmother's home and said: "Something's happened. I've done something stupid."
He later admitted to a friend he had stabbed Mr Gannon "a couple of times", but that he did not think it was "that bad".
Carroll went on to state: "I'll take responsibility for what I have done."
It was three days later when he was finally held in connection with the outstanding warrant.
Police later questioned him about the stabbing, but he denied being involved and claimed he had only read about in the newspaper.
The court heard that Mr Carroll's fatal wound cut through his carotid artery and jugular vein.
It emerged Carroll, who has a 666 tattoo, already had a violent past including convictions for assault and having a knife.
He was jailed for 60 days in September for the assault on his mother.
Carroll will be sentenced for the murder in the new year.
