Crystal Palace rule out 'stepping stone' appointment as manager

Crystal Palace are looking to appoint a long-term manager who will not treat the club as a "stepping stone", says chairman Steve Parish.

Sam Allardyce resigned as boss on 23 May after just five months in the role.
The Eagles are looking for their eighth manager in seven years, but Parish is seeking someone to come in "over a long period of time".
"We do not really want someone who sees it as a stepping stone," Parish told American radio station SiriusXM FC.
Allardyce replaced Alan Pardew in December on a two-and-half-year deal with the Eagles one point above the relegation zone.
He led the club to eight wins in 21 games to guide them to a 14th-place finish.
"In the past we have had managers like Steve Coppell who have been at the club a long time and helped build the club," added Parish.
"If we could get one of those relationships again that would be preferable."
Parish said he wanted a manager who would build on, rather than change, the playing style that has kept the club in the top flight for the past four seasons.
He added: "We have got a personnel and a way of playing. It has served us well. Do we try and change that again?
"That will inform probably where we go on the list of managers. After that you are just looking for somebody who has got a long-term view for the club."
