Bert Brissenden funeral: Honours for Kent's 'oldest firefighter'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A funeral for Kent's "oldest firefighter" is to take place with full service honours following his death at the age of 105.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Bert Brissenden was born in Ashford in 1910 and joined the Auxiliary Fire Service at Canterbury in 1938.
He served during the World War Two London Blitz and the Baedeker Raids on Canterbury.
He died peacefully at High Meadows Care Home in Canterbury, where he had been a resident for about three years.
Howard Myers of the Kent Fire & Rescue Service Retirement Association (KFRSRA) said: "Bert was made an honorary life member of the Kent Fire & Rescue Service Retirement Association [in 2008] in recognition of his age, fire service history and because we liked him."
Mr Brissenden, who remained with the Auxiliary Fire Service until 1963, was described by KFRSRA as a "spritely man" who had an "engaging personality" and a "zest for life".
In 2010, he celebrated his 100th birthday with on-duty officers at Canterbury Fire Station.
Mr Myers said: "He even got into the crew cab of the appliance unaided and went out for a short excursion, followed by tea with his new friends."
Mr Brissenden will be cremated at 10:00 BST at Barham Crematorium in Kent on Monday.
