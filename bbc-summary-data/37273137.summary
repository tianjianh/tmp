[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Sevdet Ramadan Besim wanted to carry out the attack at an Anzac Day event in April.
He pleaded guilty in the Victorian Supreme Court to one count of plotting a terrorist act.
Besim had discussed the plan with a teenager in the UK, who was sentenced to life earlier this year.
The 15-year-old from Blackburn, who has not been named, is believed to be the youngest Briton guilty of a terror offence.
He will serve at least five years for inciting terrorism and will only be released once he is no longer considered to be dangerous.
The court had heard that the two of them also joked about packing explosives into a kangaroo's pouch and setting it loose on police officers.
Anzac Day is the annual commemoration of the 1915 Gallipoli landings in Turkey by Australian and New Zealand troops.
