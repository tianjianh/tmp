Fifty-nine shotguns have been handed in to police as part of a firearms surrender in Staffordshire.

People were invited to drop off weapons without fear of prosecution over a two-week period that ended on Sunday.
The 59 shotguns - including two sawn-offs - were among 293 items handed in. The others included 17 revolvers, 26 pistols and 65 air weapons. All the weapons will be destroyed.
Ch Insp Phil Fortun said the operation had been a "huge success".
"A sawn-off shotgun is usually the result of someone altering a weapon to use in criminality," he said.
"Having two sawn-off shotguns surrendered means they will never be used for such activity."
Changes in the law in July increased the maximum jail sentence for illegal possession of a firearm from 10 years to life.
Last week West Midlands Police revealed more than 100 guns had been handed in as part of its firearms surrender.
