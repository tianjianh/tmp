The former LA Lakers star is in hospital, where he is on life support.
Mr Odom, who married reality television star Khloe Kardashian in 2009, has long struggled with addiction.
An employee of Love Ranch told 911 dispatchers that Odom, 35, had been taking cocaine and libido enhancers, said a Nevada police officer.
Nye County Sheriff Sharon Wehrly said on Wednesday that a worker at the legal brothel reported Odom was found unresponsive with blood coming from his nose and mouth.
The 911 caller also said Odom had over several days been taking cocaine, and 10 tablets to enhance sexual performance.
Nevada authorities have taken a blood sample to establish if there was anything in his body.
After visiting him at a Las Vegas hospital, the Reverend Jesse Jackson said there were signs of responsiveness.
US media report that although Kardashian filed for divorce in 2013, it had yet to be processed and she was making decisions about his medical care.
Odom won the NBA championship with the Lakers in 2009 and 2010 and was named NBA Sixth Man of the Year in 2011.
He last played in the NBA in 2013 with the Clippers.
