Michael Meekins, 63, was walking near Fleetwood Golf Club in Lancashire at 20:35 GMT on Tuesday when he was struck by a car, Lancashire Police said.
He had been out with his wife who was celebrating her birthday.
A 23-year-old man from Fleetwood has been arrested on suspicion of causing death by dangerous driving and causing death by careless driving whilst unfit through drink or drugs.
Mr Meekins suffered fatal injuries and died at the scene on Princes Way.
A Volkswagen Golf has been recovered from an address on Lindle Road in Fleetwood as part of the investigation.
Police said it was "an incredibly tragic incident".
Det Insp Alisa Wilson said: "We are still interested in speaking to the driver of a blue coloured hatchback, possibly a Vauxhall Astra, which stopped but left the scene before police arrived.
"We also want to talk to the driver of a silver or grey Ford Focus that passed close to the ambulance at the scene on nearby Chatsworth Avenue shortly after the incident."
