The man, who is in his 30s, was taken to hospital after being run over in London Fields, Hackney, at about 10:35 BST.
The air ambulance attended the scene close to the park's barbecue area, which has been closed.
Hackney Council said it was investigating the "serious incident".
A council spokesperson said: "There was an accident this morning in the barbecue area of London Fields involving one of our parks vehicles and a member of the public.
"They have been taken to hospital for treatment, and our thoughts are with them and their family."
The barbecue area will remain closed until further notice, Hackney Council said.
