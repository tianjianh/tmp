[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Tailbacks have cleared on the M8 eastbound which was closed for nine hours at Junction 6 after a lorry jack-knifed before lunchtime.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The crash caused disruption on surrounding roads, including the M80, M9 and M876, which were slower and busier than usual.
The M8's eastbound carriageway reopened shortly before 20:30.
The westbound carriageway, which had been reduced to one lane, was opened to all traffic 30 minutes earlier.
Motorists had been diverted onto the B7066 via Newhouse and Salsburgh to rejoin the M8 at J5.
The crashed lorry blocked the east side of the road between J6, close to Newhouse, and J5 Shotts and was then reportedly hit by a van.
Police Scotland said two people had been injured in the incident at 11:30.
The Kincardine Bridge was closed eastbound for a time but has now re-opened. While this closure was in place, queues and traffic were diverted across the Clackmannanshire Bridge.
