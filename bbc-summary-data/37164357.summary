Fraser, 22, made his Premier League debut for the Cherries against West Ham on Sunday after making 21 appearances for the Tractor Boys last season.
"It was massive," the Scotland international said after his display for Bournemouth at the London Stadium.
"I've spent years trying to get to this point in my career and hopefully there's more to come at this level."
Fraser's spell playing under Mick McCarthy at Portman Road, which included six goals, was twice disrupted by hamstring tears.
"The recovery was hard," he told BBC Radio Solent. "I was supposed to be out for just four weeks following the second injury, but it ended up being five months.
"I pushed things a bit too soon as I wanted to play more games. But it was a different side of football compared to Bournemouth.
"It was nitty-gritty and I picked up different bits that helped my game. I've seen changes and the gaffer's seen changes too."
