Russell Slade says Cardiff City are "still in the fight" for the Championship play-offs and has urged fans to "stay with us".

Tuesday's 2-1 defeat by Brentford left them six points shy of sixth-placed Sheffield Wednesday.
Ipswich also have a mathematical chance of making the play-offs with three league games remaining.
"We're still in the fight and there could be another twist in the tail," said Slade.
"Stay with us, we'll keep fighting and the one thing you never do is give up."
The Bluebirds host already-relegated Bolton Wanderers on Saturday while Sheffield Wednesday are at Derby County in the lunchtime kick-off.
If Wednesday win and Cardiff lose or draw, Slade's men's hopes are over.
However, if Cardiff win and Wednesday lose, the play-off rivals' encounter on Saturday, 30 April will go a long way to deciding who has the chance to challenge for promotion.
Wednesday also have a vastly superior goal difference to Cardiff.
"Realistically it's a small chance, but whilst it's a chance we shall keep plugging away," said Slade.
Ipswich are two points behind Cardiff and would need both their rivals to slip up as the season draws to a close.
Kenneth Zahore came off the bench to provide Cardiff's late consolation at Brentford, after Scott Hogan had scored two late goals for the home side.
But Slade defended only sending on Zahore six minutes before the end of normal time and after Hogan had scored his second for the hosts.
"I don't think you can start looking at things like that and saying I should have done this, should we have done this?" said Slade.
"It's alright looking back. That group had played very well in the first period.
"Kenneth's come on previously and it's not quite happened for him and he's missed opportunities.
"I'm delighted for him. He's come on, he's scored an opportunity and we're pleased for him and that might give him a little bit of confidence and momentum going forward so it's a positive.
"However, we still find ourselves six points behind Sheffield."
Former Cardiff defender, now pundit Danny Gabbidon also retains hopes they can squeeze into the play-offs.
"It's going to be a fascinating couple of weeks and that's why I feel it's not over - these next two games, there's still a possibility," said Gabbidon.
