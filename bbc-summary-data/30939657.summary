Call to move war memorial in Carmarthen

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Residents in Carmarthen are being asked if they think the war memorial in the town should be moved or not.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The County War Memorial on Priory Street commemorates the 1,913 men and women from Carmarthenshire who died in both world wars and the Korean War.
It is next to the infirmary where the wounded came to recover, however the site will be turned into flats.
Carmarthen MP Simon Hart believes the memorial's location is now irrelevant and wonders if it should be moved.
"Priory Street has become rather out of the way and you could argue that it is an odd place for the county's main war memorial," he said.
"But people may feel very strongly that it should stay where it has always been. I'd be very keen to hear people's thoughts on the matter."
