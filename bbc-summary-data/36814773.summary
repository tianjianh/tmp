Glasgow's Ahmadiyya Muslim community is asking faith and non-faith groups to unite in condemning the "barbaric" attack in Nice in which 84 people died.

It is inviting all groups to "stand united against extremism and all forms of terrorism" by attending a dinner marking the end of Ramadan.
A minute's silence will be observed for the Nice victims, their families and loved ones at the event.
The Ahmadiyya community is known for its peaceful interfaith concerns.
In April, it launched a campaign promoting "peace, love and unity" following the death of Glasgow shopkeeper Asad Shah, who was a member of the Ahmadiyya community.
He died after an attack outside his shop on 24 March. Tanveer Ahmed, from Bradford, has admitted murdering him.
France has been in mourning since Mohamed Lahouaiej-Bouhlel drove a lorry into crowds marking Bastille Day, before being shot dead by police.
French President Francois Hollande has described it as a terrorist act.
In a statement, the Ahmadiyya community said it was extending a "very warm invite" to politicians, police and different community and faith groups, including Christian, Jewish and Sikh, to attend its annual Eid dinner in Glasgow on Sunday.
It added: "We are shocked and saddened to hear of Thursday's terror attacks in Nice in which dozens of innocent people have been killed.
"The victims of these barbaric attacks and their families never deserve this and they are in our thoughts and prayers.
"All forms of terrorism and extremism are completely against the true teachings of Islam. The Holy Quran has said that to kill even one innocent person is akin to killing all of mankind.
"We hope the perpetrators of these evil attacks are swiftly brought to justice."
