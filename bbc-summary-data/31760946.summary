Jerusalem: Israeli police hit in Palestinian car attack

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A Palestinian has rammed his car into a group of Israeli pedestrians in Jerusalem, injuring six policewomen, police say.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
It happened on the seam of East and West Jerusalem, on the same junction as a previous attack last year.
Police say the driver tried to stab people before he was shot and seriously wounded by a security guard.
The incident came shortly after Palestinian officials voted to halt security co-operation with Israel.
Police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld described it as a "terrorist attack", adding that the injured officers are in a "light, moderate condition" in hospital.
Local media have identified the attacker as Mohammed Salaymeh and there are reports of clashes between Palestinians and Israeli forces around his home in East Jerusalem.
The attack took place as the streets were busy with people celebrating the Jewish holiday of Purim.
The Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) voted to suspend co-operation, part of 1993 peace accords with Israel, at a meeting on Thursday night. The move requires the stamp of Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas in order to be put into effect.
It follows Israel's decision to suspend the transfer of taxes to the Palestinians after they applied to join the International Criminal Court to pursue war crimes allegations against Israel.
Last year, Palestinian militants killed three Israelis and an Ecuadorian woman in attacks using vehicles in Jerusalem as tensions soared between Israel and the Palestinians.
Israel has occupied East Jerusalem since the 1967 Middle East war and annexed it in a move not recognised internationally.
It regards the whole of Jerusalem as its "eternal and indivisible" capital, while the Palestinians want East Jerusalem as the capital of a future Palestinian state.
Correction 13 March 2015: The article has been amended to make clear that a suspension of security co-operation with Israel is not automatic.
