"It's going to be a tough game. When we faced Barnsley earlier in the season, it wasn't easy even after we started very well.
"After we had a player sent off, it was hard. They're a good team with lots of ability, as well as physique and pace.
"But to be fair, every game we play is going to be hard, so we need to be sharp to get a result on Saturday against Barnsley."
BBC Radio Berkshire's Tim Dellor:
Here are two in-form Championship teams. A couple of weeks ago, they were also two teams vying for a play-off spot.
But some Reading fans are now getting carried away with life, and are wondering if they can catch second-placed Brighton.
Based on the last 10 years, to reach the Championship play-offs, you need 73 points. The automatic promotion figure is an average of 86 points.
If the next 16 games go as well as the most recent 16, then Reading will move beyond the 86-point mark. Both Barnsley and Reading will be optimistic as they move into the last three months of the season.
