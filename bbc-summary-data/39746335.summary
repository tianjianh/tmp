Formula 1 teams and drivers are showing their support at this weekend's Russian Grand Prix with #BillyWhizz stickers on their cars and helmets.
An online fundraisier for the 17-year-old has raised more than Â£760,000.
"It really hit home," said Hamilton. "Just to see a kid, I've been there, been in that position of racing."
The three-time world champion added: "He was doing well fighting to get to Formula One and then such a horrific incident.
"I think I was affected more by Billy's incident than I probably have been by most, with the exception of what happened in Formula One."
Monger hit the back of another car on 16 April during the Formula 4 British Championship at Donington Park in Leicestershire and had to be airlifted to hospital.
Mercedes driver Hamilton, 32, pointed to the example of former Formula 1 driver Alex Zanardi, who had both legs amputated after crashing in the American Memorial 500 CART race at Lausitz, Germany, in 2001.
The 50-year-old Italian returned to racing less than two years after the accident, competing in the World Touring Car Championship.
He then took up hand-cycling and won four Paralympic gold medals.
"My mind just shines onto Zanardi and showing what he was able to do," added Hamilton. "I have all the belief, or hope, that Billy will be able to do something similar."
