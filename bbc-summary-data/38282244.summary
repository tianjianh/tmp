As well as the African Player of the Year and Africa-based African Player of the Year  shortlists which were announced last month, a range of other awards will also be handed out.
Continental successes feature heavily in the categories including nods to Nigeria's women's Nations Cup winners and Uganda's Gabon 2017 qualifiers.
Arsenal striker Asisat Oshaola, who finished as the top scorer with Nigeria at the women's Africa Cup of Nations in Cameroon, is amongst the names on the Women's Player of the Year shortlist.
The Super Falcons coach, Florence Omagbemi, is rewarded for Nigeria's triumph with a nomination for Coach of the Year.
She will face competition from, amongst others, Uganda coach Milutin 'Micho' Sredojevic, who guided the Cranes to their first Africa Cup of Nations finals in 39 years.
Also on that list is Pitso Mosimane who coached South Africa's Mamelodi Sundowns to the African Champions League title.  Sundowns are also on the Club of the Year shortlist.
Other names in the frame for an award are Manchester City's Nigeria striker Kelechi Iheanacho who is up for the Most Promising Talent prize, and fellow Super Eagle Alex Iwobi who features in the Youth Player of the Year category.
The winners will be announced at an awards ceremony in Abuja, Nigeria on Thursday, 5 January 2017.
