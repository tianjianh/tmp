A group of "grey graffiti artists" have been flagging up potential pavement hazards with spray paint.

The project in Levenshulme, Manchester hopes to highlight difficult areas for elderly or vulnerable people.
The biodegradable paint reveals parts of the pavement which might trip up those with mobility problems.
The "graffiti" volunteers are all connected to Manchester's Age Friendly team, which aims to raise the concerns of older people.
Levenshulme Inspire, which works to make the area more accessible for the elderly, said the paint is temporary and will wear off naturally.
"While it's there it does at least show people where we think potential hazards could be," added co-ordinator, Kate Williams.
Manchester City Council called the project "art with heart" and said it was "gratifying to see communities getting involved in looking after one another."
