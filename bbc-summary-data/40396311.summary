[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
It is the second time the hooker has skippered the Lions during the tour, having led them to a win over the Chiefs.
Coach Warren Gatland made the decision after the Lions lost the opening Test against New Zealand 30-15 on Saturday.
The second Test against the All Blacks is on Saturday, 1 July.
"We are obviously hugely disappointed with the result but it is important to regroup," said Gatland.
"We know there are a lot of players motivated to go out and get a result for the whole group.
"A few players put their hands up for selection from the Chiefs game and played their way into the Test team so they know that there is another opportunity for them on Tuesday against the Super Rugby champions."
Wing George North and centre Jonathan Joseph will both start against the Hurricanes, while Jack Nowell is at full-back.
Lock George Kruis is on the bench having played the whole 80 minutes of the first Test against New Zealand.
The All Blacks have released Julian Savea, Jordie Barrett and Ngani Laumape back to the Hurricanes for the game, while Nehe Milner-Skudder also starts.
