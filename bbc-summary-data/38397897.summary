20-year-old Tutton finished in fourth place in the 200m breaststroke at Rio 2016, missing out on a bronze medal by 6/100ths of a second.
She ended her season with a bronze at the World Short Course Championships.
"This time last year it was just a dream that I would have swam how I did and achieved the things I did," she told BBC Wales Sport.
"It's great to have lived it. I've set myself some more dreams."
The Rhondda swimmer secured a bronze in the 200m breaststroke at the World Short Course Championships in Windsor, Canada in December and set a new British record in the 100m breaststroke final.
Tutton was still a teenager when she broke the British 200m breaststroke record with a stunning display at the British Swimming Championships in April.
The City of Cardiff swimmer's performance in Glasgow impressed selectors and she was included in Great Britain's swimming team for Rio 2016.
"I had to keep pinching myself to remind me this is what you've been training for your whole life," Tutton said.
"It just felt like a dream the whole time if I'm honest.
"I still kick myself because it was so close and it was just a fraction just a flinch on the block that could have changed the position of the draw."
Tutton competed in Rio alongside three other Welsh swimmers, Jazz Carlin, Georgia Davies and Ieuan Lloyd.
Commonwealth gold medallist Carlin won two silvers at Rio and shared an apartment in the athletes' village with Tutton.
"We shared the same sort of programme because we were racing on the same days, seeing how she relaxed and how she prepared for things it was kind of nice," Tutton added.
"I was on the same page as Jazz. She was doing her own thing but I was doing mine alongside. She's an inspirational woman.
"I'm so proud of being Welsh, just getting to talk to one another in the team."
