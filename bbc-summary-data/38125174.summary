Arsenal right-back Mathieu Debuchy fears he has a "severe" injury, says manager Arsene Wenger.

The 31-year-old made his first Gunners appearance since November 2015 in a 3-1 win over Bournemouth, but a hamstring injury forced him off after 16 minutes.
"I have to speak to medical people, but you can only assess it really after 48 hours," said Wenger.
"You have to let it bleed and usually they have an MRI scan 48 hours later to see how big the damage is."
Two goals from Alexis Sanchez and one from Theo Walcott gave Wenger's men victory over the Cherries.

Debuchy's previous outing for Arsenal came when he was a late substitute in a Champions League win over Dinamo Zagreb before he went on loan to French club Bordeaux.
He played 70 minutes for the Arsenal Under-23s before Sunday's game.
"When I picked the squad, I imagined that something could happen to Debuchy because he's had many setbacks," said Wenger.
"He is devastated. He is such a great guy and puts such a commitment into his daily preparation.
"He started very well and was sharp. He did it on a backheel pass that is quite dangerous for the hamstring."
Arsenal had drawn against Tottenham, Manchester United and Paris St-Germain - the first two of those results in the Premier League - before the win over Bournemouth.
"We are happy," said Wenger. "To win for us was vital because it was after the Champions League and as well because we didn't win for a few games.
"We had a few draws and that is a bit frustrating. It played on the mind of the players."
