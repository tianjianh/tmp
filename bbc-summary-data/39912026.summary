Demi Mitchell, Angel Gomes, Josh Harrop and Scott McTominay could make their senior bows, while Paul Pogba and Timothy Fosu-Mensah will play.
Marouane Fellaini and Chris Smalling have minor injuries and may be rested ahead of the Europa League final.
James Tomkins should be fit for Crystal Palace after an ankle problem but Yohan Cabaye is a doubt due to a foot injury.
Andros Townsend will miss the game because of an Achilles injury, while Scott Dann is expected to be absent with a knee problem.
Steve Bower: "So it's the game Jose Mourinho didn't want, on the day he didn't want; the week ahead will determine if it turns out to be the season he didn't want, with events in Stockholm on Wednesday determining whether he has restored the Champions League nights for Manchester United.
"Before that, some of his players will get important minutes ahead of the Europa League final and some will get their first experience of the Premier League.
"Crystal Palace are just delighted that they aren't heading to Old Trafford full of nerves and in need of some sort of result to secure their top-flight status.
"They will be determined that in 12 months time, after a full season under Sam Allardyce, they will be higher up the table."

Manchester United manager Jose Mourinho: "For the kids it will be a great experience to play in the Premier League in the last match of the season.
"It will be a big occasion but I think the best [scenario] for a young player is in the middle of an experienced structure, where he can be supported.
"We have tried to bring the guys who are more adapted to playing at this level at the moment. Lots of them [starting] together, no."
Crystal Palace manager Sam Allardyce: "Whether Jose plays a weakened side or not, it will always be a difficult task because the younger players at Manchester United are definitely very talented.
"The higher you can finish in the league, the bigger and better the prize money, so if we can get a result at Old Trafford then that will be fantastic.
"The club should be interested in the money because it gives us a bigger budget. But the players shouldn't be interested in the money until they've won."
I have no idea what sort of team either manager will put out, so it is very difficult to predict the outcome.
Jose Mourinho will make lots of changes before Wednesday's Europa League final, but he has such a big squad that it could still be a strong Manchester United side, if he wants it to be.
