Jessica Galyon, 29, was arrested in February after she allegedly sexually assaulted a 16-year-old boy during school hours.
The victim's family filed a lawsuit on Monday against the school district and the contractor who employed her.
The boy dropped out of school after the alleged incident.
The lawsuit accuses Roane County Schools and Compass One of gross negligence in allowing the alleged rape to occur.
Ms Galyon began talking to the Midway High School student in August, when she allegedly asked for the student's phone number and for him to become her friend on Facebook, the Knoxville News Sentinel reported.
She then began sending "flirtatious and sexual messages" to the teenager, who rebuffed her advances, according to the lawsuit.
In September Ms Galyon invited the boy to a hotel room to have sex, but he rejected the offer and said he did not want "any further contact", the lawsuit said.
He later confronted her about her behaviour and she allegedly took him into a room and raped him during school hours.
"This was the first ever sexual encounter of any kind that (the boy) had ever had in his life," the lawsuit said.
Ms Galyon's alleged harassment of the teenager was reportedly known around school.
The boy left to enrol in home schooling after the incident.
A month after the alleged rape, a school faculty member alerted administration officials, which led to the janitor's arrest.
