England v Malta - How the players rated

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
England dominated the match against Malta but could only score twice in interim manager Gareth Southgate's first game in charge.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Southgate gave a debut to Manchester United's Jesse Lingard, while deploying captain Wayne Rooney in a midfield role.
Who impressed? Who struggled?
Barely had anything to do apart from one late save from Andre Agius.
Nothing to do defensively and wasted too many good crossing positions.
Almost a night off. Missed a first-half chance.
Hardly tested but immaculate when required.
Only lasted 18 minutes after suffering a hamstring injury.
Been critical of him in the past but easily England's best here. Busy and created opportunities.
Industrious. Scored one goal, could have had others and missed badly near the end.
Sat deep and sprayed passes around as well as having a couple of shots but not the driving force of old. Lucky to escape heavier sanction for a bad first-half challenge.
Worked hard with little end result. Missed a good second-half chance.
Had a first-half header saved by Malta goalkeeper Andrew Hogg and almost set up a goal for Walcott in the second half. Decent debut.
Scored his first England goal at Wembley for two years and could have had others - a reminder of his class and threat.
Decent performance as a substitute. Did his prospects no harm.
Clearly a big favourite with England's fans. Lively and Alli should have scored from his perfect cross.
Quiet - little impact.
