Polish national Daria Pionko, 21, was found seriously injured in Springwell Road, Holbeck, on 23 December and died later in hospital.
Det Supt Simon Atkinson said Miss Pionko had been the victim of a "sustained and vicious attack".
A 38-year-old man arrested in connection with the incident was released without charge.
A post mortem examination found Miss Pionko died as a result of head and facial injuries.
She was found in a defined managed area where sex workers operate during set hours.
Mr Atkinson said: "This was a sustained and vicious attack and it is absolutely vital that the person responsible is caught and taken off our streets."
The managed area has been in operation since 2014.
It was introduced by the police, council and other agencies in an effort to reduce the impact of prostitution on residents and better engage with sex workers.
Speaking last week, Supt Sam Millar said it had seen some "significant successes", including improving relationships between sex workers and police.
