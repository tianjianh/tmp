Supporters were complimentary of the "wonderful" capital city, but they were not happy to swap their native lager for its Welsh counterpart.
Koen Gutschoven from Bruges said: "The lager here has no froth. It's like the pint is dead."
Nicholas Huwairi from Brussels added: "Belgium lager is the best in the world."
The match kicks off at 19:45 BST at Cardiff City Stadium.
