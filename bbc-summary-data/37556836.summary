The 27-year-old denied the offence which happened in the 32-12 defeat on 23 September, but was found guilty by an independent Rugby Football League disciplinary tribunal on Tuesday.
Fifita, who was fined Â£300, can serve the suspension in pre-season matches.
The Tongan is out of contract having joined from Cronulla Sharks last June.
