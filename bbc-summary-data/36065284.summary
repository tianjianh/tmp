Finn Russell says a top-two finish must now be the aim for Glasgow Warriors to guarantee a home Pro12 semi-final.

Russell was instrumental in their 46-10 demolition of Scarlets, scoring two tries and 21 points in an eighth straight win for the champions.
"It's definitely the goal of ours to get a home semi-final," Russell said after their biggest away win this term.
"If we play like we did today, keep building on the momentum that we've got, we'll hopefully get it."
Wing Lee Jones also bagged a brace of tries, with scrum-half Henry Pyrgos, centre Mark Bennett and wing Tommy Seymour also crossing as Glasgow ran riot in Llanelli.
The win keeps Warriors breathing down the necks of Leinster and Connacht - who beat Munster on Saturday - at the top of the table, and Russell believes the momentum is with his side.
"Six weeks ago we were mid-table with a couple of games in hand," the Scotland fly-half told BBC Scotland.
"I think beating Leinster and then beating Zebre was a big help for us. Getting a couple of bonus points over in Italy over the last couple of weeks, and then today, the home semi-final is definitely reachable. It's in our hands I'd say."
Head coach Gregor Townsend agrees that Glasgow are now in control of their own destiny with two matches of the regular season left, at home to Zebre on 29 April before finishing with a trip to Connacht on 7 May.
"If we do win next week it probably gets us there (into the play-offs)," Townsend said.
"It'll be down to that Connacht game whether we get a home semi-final or not. We know Connacht is going to be a really tough game.
"The fact we've hit form is really pleasing for us as coaches. We know we've created an opportunity now and it's up to us to take it."
Townsend was effusive in his praise for man-of-the-match Russell, who excelled on his return to the side.
''Finn was in the zone today," he added. "His first try is a touch of class. To notice that there's nobody in behind, and to then actually have the conviction, the courage to go for that chip and execute it really well was fantastic. He played well throughout.
"I thought he defended very well. He had some big tackles which really helped us. It was great to see him in form."
