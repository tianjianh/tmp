The women have been named as friends Mhairi Convy, 18, and Laura Stewart, 20 - both students in Glasgow.
They were struck, along with a 36-year-old man, on Friday morning in North Hanover Street, close to the Buchanan Galleries shopping centre.
Police said it was thought the Range Rover came off the road and hit the pedestrians on the pavement.
Ms Convy from Lennoxtown, East Dunbartonshire, and Ms Stewart, from Cumbernauld, were students at Glasgow College of Commerce.
Emergency crews were called to the scene and the two women were taken to Glasgow Royal Infirmary where they died.
The male pedestrian and the 50-year-old male driver of the Range Rover were being treated in hospital.
The driver is said to be in a stable condition while the injured pedestrian has been released.
Strathclyde Police have appealed for any witnesses to come forward.
Officers said the cause of the crash was unknown and an inquiry was under way to establish the exact circumstances.
They added that it would be inappropriate to comment or speculate on the cause until the investigation had been carried out.
