[SN]TITLE[SN]
Ex-Radio 1 DJ Chris Denning in court over sex offence charges

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Former BBC Radio 1 DJ Chris Denning has appeared in court charged with 41 sex offences against 22 boys.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The charges relate to alleged offences between 1967 and 1985 against boys aged nine to 16.
Mr Denning was a member of the original Radio 1 team when the station was launched in 1967.
The 73-year-old from Basildon spoke only to confirm his name, date of birth and address as he appeared in the dock at Westminster Magistrates' Court.
Dressed in a grey sweatshirt at court, Mr Denning was initially arrested under Operation Yewtree in June 2013.
He worked as a music producer for The Beatles and helped launch the Bay City Rollers. He also ran his own music and video production business.
He was the first announcer heard on BBC Two when the television channel launched in 1964.
On Thursday, the Crown Prosecution Service said there was sufficient evidence for a realistic prospect of conviction and that a prosecution was in the public interest.
Prosecutors found there was not enough evidence to prosecute in connection with three further alleged victims.
Mr Denning is the fifth person to be prosecuted as part of Operation Yewtree.
