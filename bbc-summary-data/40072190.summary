[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Paul Catherwood, 27, from Mourneview Park, Lisburn, is accused of attacking another man at a house party at Rathmore Gardens on Saturday morning.
Mr Catherwood claimed he acted in self-defence after he was targeted in a hammer attack.
He is also charged with assault occasioning actual bodily harm, common assault and having an offensive weapon.
On Monday, Belfast Magistrates' Court was told that the man who was stabbed required surgery for multiple wounds and that the most severe was when his chest was punctured close to his heart.
The court heard that Mr Catherwood also slashed a woman on the arm, adding:  "Another said she had to take evasive action to stop him when he was approaching her with the knife, making a slashing motion."
A detective constable said the incident was aggravated by alcohol and involved an alleged element of sectarianism.
Mr Catherwood's lawyer said he was acting in self defence following a hammer attack.
He is due to appear again in court by video-link on 6 June.
