Windy Edge wind farm refusal recommended

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Planning officers have advised councillors to refuse plans for a wind farm south of Hawick due to concerns over its adverse landscape impact.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Infinis UK wants to put up nine turbines in the Windy Edge project north of Hermitage Castle.
The project has attracted more than 300 letters of opposition, along with more than 100 in support of the scheme.
Planning officials have recommended refusal, saying the wind farm would be "incongruous and anachronistic".
Supporters of the scheme claim the turbines would have less of an impact on the landscape than forestry, and that it would help combat climate change.
Opponents believe there would be adverse visual impacts on areas like Hermitage Castle and the wider landscape.
