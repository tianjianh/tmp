[SN]TITLE[SN]
London memorial service to remember Charles Kennedy

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Senior political figures are expected to attend a memorial service in London for former Liberal Democrat leader Charles Kennedy.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 55-year-old, who had led the party for more than six years and was a former MP for Ross, Skye and Lochaber, died in June.
Mr Kennedy died at his home in Caol, near Fort William.
Tuesday afternoon's service is to be held in Southwark with friends, family and political colleagues expected.
Mr Kennedy died after suffering a major haemorrhage as a result of a long battle with alcoholism.
A Mass was later celebrated at St John's Roman Catholic Church in Caol before Mr Kennedy's body was buried at his family's cemetery at Clunes, Achnacarry.
The University of Glasgow held a memorial service to the Inverness-born politician earlier this year.
Mr Kennedy was a former student of the university and was also its first rector to be re-elected for a second term since former prime minister Benjamin Disraeli in the 1870s.
