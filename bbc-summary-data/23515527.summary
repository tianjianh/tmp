The 24-year-old, who made six appearances during one season at the Valley, has signed a two-year deal with the League One side.
Bees manager Uwe Rosler told the club website: "With Simon Moore going out the door, there is an opportunity for someone to come in.
"We decided David was the perfect choice for us."
He added: "He is at the right age and he is very hungry to make the number one spot his own.
"David will face strong competition for the goalkeeper spot from Jack Bonham and Richard Lee, when Richard is fit again."
"Goalkeeper is a crucial position and David is a very good player."
Former England Under-20 international Button came through the youth ranks at Tottenham but only made one senior appearance for the Premier League club before joining Charlton last summer.
Since turning pro in 2005, Button has had loan spells at 11 different clubs.
