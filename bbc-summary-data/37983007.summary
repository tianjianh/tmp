League Two: Yeovil Town P-P Crawley Town

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Tuesday's League Two match between Yeovil Town and Crawley Town has been postponed after a pitch inspection at Huish Park.

Standing water on the pitch meant the game was called off shortly before 11:00 GMT, with further rain expected in the afternoon.
A Yeovil statement said: "Both Town manager Darren Way and Crawley boss Dermot Drummy were present and happy with the decision."
A new date has yet to be confirmed.
