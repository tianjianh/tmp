[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A colliery which once scarred the landscape and caused health problems for miners is being transformed into a site to promote health and wellbeing.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Coegnant Colliery and Maesteg washery in Bridgend county have been renovated by Natural Resources Wales (NRW).
The Spirit of Llynfi Woodland Project includes walking and cycling trails among 60,000 broadleaf and fruit trees.
NRW's Geminie Drinkwater said the idea was to give people a place "to relax and exercise in a tranquil setting".
It is hoped the project will help improve the health of people living in the area.
It is jointly funded by the Welsh Government's nature fund and Ford.
Ms Drinkwater, a community engagement officer, said: "Research by Public Health Wales discovered that if you are over 50 and live in this area your healthy life expectancy is 20 years less than if you lived just nine miles away in Bridgend.
"The inspiration for the Spirit of Llynfi woodland has come from the community and is all about bringing people and nature closer together and getting them actively involved in the countryside on their doorstep."
In a nod to the industrial past, the site has 'The Keeper of the Colliery', a 9ft (2.7m) one-and-a-half tonne oak sculpture of a miner, created by Newport artist Chris Wood.
Plans for the future include a pond to encourage amphibians to the area, dog-walking trails and a sensory park for people with disabilities.
