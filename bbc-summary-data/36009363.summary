The 23-year-old victim from Brighton was hit by a Tesco lorry when the fight spilled on to Western Road.
He was found lying in the road by emergency services at 02:40 BST and died at the scene.
A 27-year-old Hove man arrested on suspicion of murder is in police custody, Sussex Police said.
Western Road from Montpelier Road to Norfolk Square was closed for investigations but has since reopened.
Det Ch Insp Tanya Jones from Sussex Police said: "This has been a fast-moving investigation and we have arrested a man on suspicion of murder.
"However, we are still appealing for witnesses who may have seen the fight which spilled into Western Road and then the victim being hit by a lorry."
In a statement, Tesco said: "We were deeply shocked to hear about this incident and our thoughts go out to this young man's family.
"We are co-operating fully with the police in their investigation.
"Clearly, this is a very difficult time for our colleague but we will provide him and his family with all the support they need."
