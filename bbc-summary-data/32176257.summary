Lionel Messi and Luis Suarez were on target as La Liga leaders Barcelona won their ninth match in a row to stay in control of the title race.

Following heavy pressure, Messi curled Barcelona into the lead from the edge of the penalty area before the break.
Former Liverpool striker Suarez doubled the lead as he rifled the ball into the top corner from 18 yards.
The win was sealed by Marc Bartra's close-range header before Suarez slotted in a close-range second.
Luis Enrique's men have won 20 out of their last 21 matches in all competitions and remain four points ahead of second-placed Real - who beat Rayo Vallecano 2-0 later in the evening.
Barcelona, who face Paris St-Germain in the Champions League quarter-final and play Athletic Bilbao in the Copa del Rey final, are chasing a treble.
But they will have to be more clinical than they were against relegation-threatened Almeria, with a host of chances spurned during a dominant first half.
Messi's brilliant curler from the right, his 33rd goal of the season, was all they had to show for a half in which they had 68% of possession.
Former Barcelona defender Sergi, who made more than 250 appearances for the Catalans, was taking charge of Almeria for the first time and their hopes of a shock result were effectively ended by Suarez.
The Uruguayan, who had been guilty of poor finishing in the opening half, cut inside on his left foot before drilling the ball into the top corner for Barcelona's second.
By the time Bartra headed home the third from Xavi's corner and Suarez converted Pedro's pass, Almeria already knew the game was lost.
