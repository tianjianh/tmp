Ian Bell: Warwickshire aim to build for Lancashire game on 'massive' Lord's high

Warwickshire captain Ian Bell says the 'massive high' of beating Surrey at Lord's in Saturday's One-Day Cup final can help their County Championship Division One survival battle.

"To win so convincingly was unbelievable," 34-year-old England batsman Bell told BBC WM.
"But we've now got a big week ahead of us against Lancashire.
"We want to stay in Div 1. We're eight points ahead of Hampshire and we want to make sure we finish well."
He added: "It has been frustrating, as we've been playing good cricket. But winning at Lord's again is a massive high for the club.
"Hopefully there were some young kids in the crowd who will have gone home desperately wanting to be Warwickshire players in the future, like I was, when I first saw us win here at Lord's back in 1993."
The club's fourth trophy in seven years put some silverware in the trophy cabinet at the end of a frustrating season at Edgbaston.
But Saturday night's feeling of post-match euphoria could quickly turn sour if eighth-placed Hampshire beat already-relegated Nottinghamshire - and Warwickshire do not get enough points from their home game with Lancashire.
Two months ago, the Bears still had half an interest in events at the other end of the table. And, less than a month ago, the Lancashire game this week was being lined up as an experimental fixture which might be played with a pink ball under lights if both teams were safe.
But a winless six-match run for Warwickshire has left them in seventh place, six points behind sixth-placed Lancashire, who are on an even worse Championship run, having not won in 10 matches since May.
First-choice wicketkeeper Tim Ambrose is expected to play despite nursing an injury in Saturday's final, but his stand-in Alex Mellor is expected to keep his place as an opener, having done well in the Bears' last Championship game, a narrow 31-run defeat by Somerset.
The Bears have named three spinners in the squad, including one of Saturday's Lord's heroes, Ateeq Javid.
If Warwickshire lose, a Hampshire victory would keep them up - irrespective of the number of points.
If Lancashire and Warwickshire draw and each take a maximum of 13 points, Hampshire would need to win with at least 21 points to relegate Warwickshire.
If Hampshire draw and take a maximum of 13 points, they would not be able to catch Lancashire and could only stay up if the Bears take five points or fewer.
