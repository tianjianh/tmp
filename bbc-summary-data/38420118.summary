Schools closed as Storm Barbara hits Scotland

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Strong winds, cold showers, and ice have caused power cuts and made it difficult to travel in parts of Scotland as Storm Barbara starts crossing the country.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Almost 120 schools have been forced to close, with more than 8,500 pupils missing their last day before the Christmas holidays.
The Western Isles, Skye, and the north west coast and Northern Isles are expected to experience winds as strong as 80-90 miles per hour.
Meanwhile, in Edinburgh, high winds led to the Big Wheel getting closed down to keep people safe.
