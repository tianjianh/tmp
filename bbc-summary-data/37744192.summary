Queen's University survey suggests lack of leadership

Fewer than a third of staff at Queen's University believe it is being led effectively, according to a survey conducted by the university itself.

The BBC has obtained details of the major survey.
Almost 70% - 2,479 - of the university's 3,600 staff took part in the survey earlier this year.
Only 29% of staff who responded agreed senior leaders provided "effective leadership". One in five said the university managed change effectively.
Fewer than a third gave positive responses to questions about leadership and direction.
Queen's recently introduced major changes to some faculties and more than 140 staff left under a voluntary redundancy process in 2015-16.
However, staff were more positive about other aspects of the university, with two-thirds saying they were proud to work there.
Almost nine in 10 who responded said Queen's had a high standing in Northern Ireland, while two-thirds would recommend it as a "great place to study".
The vast majority of respondents - 89% - said that they found their work interesting.
While only a quarter of staff agreed that "Queen's works as one university", more than three-quarters said it was "committed to world class research".
However, fewer than a third of staff believed any action would be taken as a result of the survey.
In a statement, a Queen's spokesperson said the university was committed to "staff engagement and a positive work environment".
"The positive results highlight a number of key strengths, including staff respect, interesting work and a sense of personal accomplishment.
"The university is now working in partnership with staff in the development of action plans in response to the results.
"This process will enable staff to initiate change in those areas highlighted as challenges and to build on the strengths identified in the survey."
The survey was carried out in April, but the results have just been circulated.
