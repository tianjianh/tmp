But Giants lost to Newcastle Eagles, Sheffield Sharks and London Lions, Flyers beat fellow rookies Force.
"It means everything," said Flyers guard Greg Streete.
"We don't want to be waiting on other teams' results, we want to know we are in the top eight because we put ourselves there.
"It sends a clear message to the rest of the league that we are a legitimate club and we are here to win."
With several injury concerns and having already clinched the title, BBL Championship winners Eagles rested key players and fell to Cheshire Phoenix and Leicester Riders.
