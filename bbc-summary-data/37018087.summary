[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Defender Carl Magnay struck twice as Hartlepool hit back with two goals inside four second-half minutes to salvage a point at Crewe.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Chelsea loanee Alex Kiwomya provided the ammunition on his first start as the Railwaymen eased into a 3-1 lead before the hour mark, only to be denied late on.
Captain Billy Paynter blew an early chance to hand Pools the lead when he clipped wide with only goalkeeper Ben Garratt to beat.
George Cooper struck the outside of the post before Kiwomya tore to the byeline and pulled the ball across goal for Chris Dagnall to flick home on 32 minutes.
Carl Magnay hit back with a superb left-footed curling effort into the top corner in the 42nd minute but Crewe were ahead again on the stroke of half-time when Kiwomya showed a neat turn inside the box and finished into the bottom corner.
Crewe appeared set for their second win of the season when Cooper's shot-come-cross deceived Trevor Carson and flew into the far corner in the 56th minute.
But Pools hit back as Padraig Amond lobbed Garratt on 73 minutes before Magnay struck again with a far-post header after Nathan Thomas' free-kick was flicked on.
Ryan Lowe wasted the chance to win it for Crewe, firing wide when through on goal.
