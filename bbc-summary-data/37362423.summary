Lee Orton, who runs charity Goals 4 Hearts, spoke out after defender Daniel Wilkinson's death, on Monday.
Wilkinson, 24, who played for Shaw Lane AFC, collapsed during a cup game at Brighouse Town FC's stadium.
Mr Orton, 33, said many smaller clubs are still without defibrillators because they can cost up to Â£1,000.
The former Brighouse player, who survived a heart attack while playing with Aimbry in the Huddersfield District League in 2013, supplied the defibrillator in use at the club.
Media reports indicated staff at the St Giles Road ground used the equipment on Wilkinson, but he was pronounced dead after being taken to hospital.
Mr Orton said despite the tragic outcome, defibrillators are very important.
"Without one, a person's chances of survival decreases by 15% each minute," he said.
"It can make all the difference."
The charity raises awareness of sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) and ensures the correct equipment is available in all public places.
Earlier, players and supporters from both clubs laid flowers on the pitch in tribute to Wilkinson, who had a suspected heart attack.
As a mark of respect, Brighouse has announced Saturday's home fixture against Colne FC has been postponed.
Wilkinson started his career at Hull City, before loan moves to Harrogate Town and North Ferriby United.
He later played for Loughborough University, Scarborough Athletic and Goole, joining Shaw Lane from Rushall Olympic in the summer.
"The club would like to thank everyone for their heartfelt messages," said Shaw Lane chairman Craig Wood in a statement.
The Evo-Stik Northern Premier League has asked fans, players and officials to observe a minute's silence at fixtures this week to mark Wilkinson's death.
