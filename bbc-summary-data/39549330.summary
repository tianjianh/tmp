Both players finished on nine under par after 72 holes, setting up a sudden-death play-off on the 18th.
Garcia, 37, holed a birdie putt for victory after his European Ryder Cup team-mate could only manage a bogey.
Charl Schwartzel was three shots back, with England's Paul Casey and Northern Ireland's Rory McIlroy in the top 10.
Jordan Spieth, one of the pre-tournament favourites, and fellow American Rickie Fowler both capitulated on the final day to finish tied 11th on one-under.
Garcia finally won one of golf's four majors - the Masters, the Open Championship, the US Open and the US PGA - after 22 previous top-10 finishes.
He became the third Spaniard to win the Masters - after Seve Ballesteros and Jose Maria Olazabal - on what would have been the 60th birthday of Ballesteros, who died in 2011.
"To join Seve and Jose - my two idols - is something amazing," said Garcia.
Shot one: Rose teed off first, pushing his drive right into the trees, only for his ball to bounce back towards play and reappear in the pine needles.
Garcia thumped his drive almost 300 yards down the fairway.
Shot two: Rose could only punch his way out of trouble onto the fairway, while Garcia to land his approach on the green.
Shot three: The Englishman responded by landing his ball about 10 foot to the right of the hole - on a similar line to his putt in regulation play about 15 minutes earlier.
After Rose pushed it left, Garcia had two shots for victory - making no mistake with his first attempt and his ball rounded the lip before dropping in.
