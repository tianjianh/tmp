The Liverpool-born 31-year-old, who has three caps for Scotland, ended a two-year spell with the Blades this summer.
McEveley played 42 times for the English League One club last season.
The left-back started his career with Blackburn Rovers and was transferred to Derby County in 2007 before joining Barnsley, but he also played for six other clubs on loan.
He has had short-term spells at Burnley, Gillingham, Ipswich Town, Preston North End, Charlton Athletic and Swindon Town during his career.
McEveley becomes the fourth defender signed by County manager Jim McIntyre this summer.
In addition of Christopher Routis from Bradford City, Kenny van der Weg from Breda and Erik Cikos from Slovan Bratislava, former Wolverhampton Wanderers goalkeeper Aaron McCarey agreed a deal with the Scottish Premiership club.
