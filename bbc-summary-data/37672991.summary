[SN]TITLE[SN]
Chievo 1-3 AC Milan

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
AC Milan ended Chievo's 12-match unbeaten home run to move up to third place in Serie A with a fourth win in five games.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Juraj Kucka put Milan ahead just before half-time with a 25-yard shot into the top corner before M'Baye Niang drove home the second in the 46th minute.
Ex-Milan midfielder Valter Birsa curled home a free-kick to pull a goal back.
But Dario Dainelli's own goal in injury-time sealed the win for Milan, who last lost to Chievo in 2005.
Chievo, who would have gone third in the table themselves with a victory, had failed to score in their five previous home games against Milan in a barren run stretching back to 2011.
Birsa's third goal of the season ended that sequence but Milan would have won more comfortably but for fine second-half saves from Stefano Sorrentino, who kept out a Niang free-kick and denied Gianluca Lapadula a first Serie A goal.
Sorrentino was finally beaten again in stoppage time when a wayward shot from Carlos Bacca hit Dainelli and rebounded into the net as Milan moved to within five points of league leaders Juventus.
