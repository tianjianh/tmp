The man, who has not been named, was crossing Manchester Road near the junction with Hollins Road in Failsworth, at 22:20 GMT on Friday.
The 59-year-old was taken to hospital but died a short time later.
Police said he was hit by a red Honda Jazz. The driver stopped at the scene but police have asked for witnesses to contact them.
In particular they would like to speak to the occupants of a light-coloured Hackney cab and a Mitsubishi Shogun waiting to turn right on to Hollins Road at the time.
