Couch and Toulson were in contention for bronze but came up 16.74 points short of third-placed Canada.
Malaysia claimed silver and North Korea finished above GB in fourth.
Before the event there was confusion about the colour of the water in the pool, which had turned green.
"I've never dived in anything like it," Couch told BBC Sport.
"We noticed it in the warm-up and then by the competition it was even more green, but if anything it actually made it a bit easier to spot [where the water was], so it didn't make a difference."
The diving pool had looked much more blue on Monday, when British pair Tom Daley and Dan Goodfellow won bronze in the men's event.
Commentators and media were at a loss to explain the change in colour, but a representative from the Maria Lenk Aquatics Centre said: "Tests were conducted and there was found to be no risk to athletes' health.
"We're investigating what the cause of the situation was, but we're happy to report the competition was successfully completed."
Couch and Toulson, who had only become partners at the end of last year, had hoped to end Britain's 56-year wait for a medal in women's diving.
That was a possibility after a big-scoring fourth dive, but they lost synchronicity as they hit the water on their final attempt.
China's Chen Ruolin, who is world champion with her partner Liu Huixia, has now equalled the Olympic record of her compatriot Wu Minxia by claiming five gold medals in diving.
