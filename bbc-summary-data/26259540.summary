BBC Cymru Wales is looking to cut 16 jobs as part of a long-running plan to reduce costs.

The posts will be lost in the Factual and Music department which currently has 110 members of staff.
BBC Wales said the changes reflected a reduction in output as a result of the Delivering Quality First (DQF) programme of savings.
Savings of more than £10m are required by 2017.
A BBC Wales spokesperson said: "This has been a very difficult decision and we will work closely with staff to try to minimise the personal impact of these changes.
"The proposed post closures in the 110-strong department (which includes 80 permanent posts) reflect the changing production requirements for local and network TV production, and follow a review of future staffing levels.
"The changes also reflect an overall reduction in local production output as a result of the DQF savings introduced after the last licence fee settlement."
The spokesperson added that the department had a strong track record in local and network production across television and radio, including X-Ray, Crimewatch and The One Show.
The BBC is briefing unions on the proposals and will look for opportunities to redeploy staff affected wherever possible.
As part of the DQF savings plan, BBC Wales is required to deliver savings totalling £10.7m by 2017.
In 2011, BBC Wales announced that it expected almost 100 posts to close over a four-year period.
To date, the broadcaster has successfully redeployed 46 staff members facing the potential risk of redundancy as a result of DQF.
