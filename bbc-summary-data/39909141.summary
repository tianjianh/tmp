St Mirren: Stevie Mallan subject of 'misdirected' bid from Barnsley

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
St Mirren midfielder Stevie Mallan is a target for Barnsley - but the English Championship side sent their offer to a fans' site by mistake.

The 21-year-old was a stand-out performer as the Buddies preserved their place in Scotland's second tier.
Barnsley emailed a bid for the player earlier this week, but it was sent in error to fans' site stmirren.co.uk.
The website's editor, who also owns the popular Scottish football site Pie and Bovril, passed the bid on to the club.
Saints sources insist Mallan has not signed for Barnsley, who finished 14th in the English Championship this season.
A 1-1 draw at champions Hibernian last Saturday ensured St Mirren stayed in the Scottish Championship, after losing only one of their last 10 league games.
