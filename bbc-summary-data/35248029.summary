Man Utd recall Januzaj from Borussia Dortmund loan

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Manchester United have recalled Adnan Januzaj from his season-long loan at Borussia Dortmund.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
United have requested the 20-year-old Belgium international forward's return because of a lack of games.
Januzaj has made 12 appearances for the Bundesliga club, which has included only three starts.
His six league outings have all been as a substitute and he has not featured since a Europa League defeat by PAOK Salonika on 10 December.
Januzaj played four times for United in August, scoring the winner at Aston Villa.
His Old Trafford contract runs until 2018.
