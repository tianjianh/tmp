Ladimeji Benson, 27, was attacked in Baddow Road, Chelmsford, Essex, on Tuesday afternoon.
He was taken to hospital after a group of men flagged down an ambulance three miles from the scene but later died from his injuries.
The 20-year-old man, of no fixed address, was arrested on Saturday.
Two men, 22 and 25, from Chelmsford, were arrested earlier this week on suspicion of assault and affray.
Both men have been bailed until 6 January, pending further inquiries.
In a statement, his family and girlfriend said: "Ladi was a special person with a beautiful heart. He was a wonderful father to his baby daughter and step-son, and a loving partner, son and brother.
"He was taken from us too soon and we are all left with a huge hole in our hearts. Our lives will never be the same without him.
"We will never see that cheeky grin again and his daughter will never know the father she adored. She had almost learned to say the word 'Dada', but now her Dada will only be a photo or a story."
