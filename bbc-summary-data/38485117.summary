He becomes boss Paul Hurst's first signing at Shrewsbury, having previously played for him at Grimsby.
Nsiala, 24, who left the Mariners to join Pools in June, has made 25 appearances this season.
"I think he's someone who can step up the levels and be a big asset for this football club," said Hurst.
Shrewsbury are waiting for confirmation from the English Football League as to whether Nsiala will be able to make his debut in Monday's League One game against Fleetwood Town.
