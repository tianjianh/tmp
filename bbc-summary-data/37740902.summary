United States Grand Prix: Daniil Kvyat retained by Toro Rosso

Red Bull have decided to retain Daniil Kvyat at their junior team Toro Rosso for 2017, ending doubts about the Russian's Formula 1 future.

Kvyat's place at Toro Rosso had been in doubt after a loss in form following his demotion from the senior Red Bull team in a swap with Max Verstappen.
But a revival in the past few races has secured his position.
"I always told Daniil his future was in his hands and he has stepped up to the mark," said team boss Franz Tost.
"In recent races, it has been clear that Daniil is back on top form."
The 22-year-old thanked Red Bull "for their support and the faith they have shown in me since I returned to the team earlier this year".
He added: "I'm very happy to stay with a team that feels like home to me. I'm really looking forward to continuing the hard work together in 2017 and I'm really aiming high.
"I will always be fully dedicated, giving my '200%', and I will be pushing as hard as I usually do."
The decision is a blow for Frenchman Pierre Gasly, the next Red Bull junior in line and the team's reserve driver. Gasly is in contention for the GP2 championship.
Team-mate Carlos Sainz's position was confirmed as long ago as June, but both drivers have been of interest to other teams in recent weeks.
Renault made a move for Sainz and Force India have talked to Kvyat since Nico Hulkenberg's decision earlier this month to move to the French team next year.
Toro Rosso's decision leaves relatively few teams without confirmed driver line-ups and the main interest is now in Williams, Force India and Renault.
Williams are to promote the Canadian rookie Lance Stroll and are expected to retain Valtteri Bottas as his partner, although the Finn has been in talks with Renault, who are also keen to sign him.
The identity of team-mates for Sergio Perez at Force India and Hulkenberg at Renault remains the subject of speculation.
Renault will decide between their current drivers Kevin Magnussen and Jolyon Palmer, and Manor's Esteban Ocon.
Force India are also interested in Ocon, while Palmer and the other Manor driver Pascal Wehrlein are in the frame as well.
