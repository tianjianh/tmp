Totnes traffic flow to change after judge quashes appeal

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Traffic flow through a Devon town centre is set to change after a judge decided a council cannot appeal against a ruling to scrap the scheme.

Devon County Council reversed traffic flow through Totnes in 2013 to make the area safer.
But some traders began legal action claiming their businesses had suffered.
The council wanted to contest a decision that the scheme should be dropped but a judge at Exeter County Court said it could not appeal.
The authority could take the case to the Supreme Court, but will still have to reinstate the original traffic flow in the meantime.
In March, the decision to reverse traffic flow through Totnes town centre was quashed in the High Court.
BBC presenter Jonathan Dimbleby was among campaigners who marched with protesters against the traffic changes which meant vehicles could no longer be driven up the High Street from the bottom of the town.
The changes reversed the previous system, in which traffic was allowed up the High Street and brought in alternative routes.
Devon County Council said: "We are disappointed by today's decision and will now consider our options."
