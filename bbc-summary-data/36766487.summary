The striker was wearing the red number 10 shirt as he scored his famous Wembley hat-trick against West Germany.
It was expected to fetch up to £500,000, but Sotheby's said the bidding failed to meet the reserve price despite "a great deal of interest".
The victory, 50 years ago, remains England's only World Cup win.
Hurst's third goal, scored in extra time, prompted Kenneth Wolstenhome's BBC commentary: "They think it's all over… it is now!"
Hurst was a prolific goal-scorer at club level, scoring 40 goals in 59 games for West Ham during the 1965-66 season, but he began the 1966 World Cup as a squad member.
He was awarded a place in the starting line-up only when the nation's top goal-scorer, Jimmy Greaves, suffered an injury ahead of the quarter-finals.
Hurst went on to score in the 18th minute of the final, and then twice again in extra time, in England's 4-2 victory.
Sotheby's estimated the shirt would sell for £300,000-£500,000.
It is believed to have been first auctioned at Christies in 2000, when it was sold for £91,750 to a private collector.
It was then bought in 2008 by an Oxfordshire-based property investor Andrew Leslau for an undisclosed sum on behalf of international investors.
Mr Leslau insured the shirt for £1m, calling it "the most important shirt in English football history".
Gabriel Heaton, from the auctioneers, said the shirt represented a "legendary moment in the annals of English football, and a sporting achievement that has never been repeated in half a century."
