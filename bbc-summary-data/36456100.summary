The Northern Ireland Fire and Rescue Service (NIFRS) received a call to a house in Westland Mews in the Bogside at about 02:45 BST on Sunday.
District Commander Kevin Lynch said that when the crews arrived at the scene, a car was alight and house was beginning to catch fire.
"Some of the crew went to establish that there was no one in the property.
"As they were doing that and dealing with the fire, a strut at the rear of the car exploded and hit one of the fire fighters, injuring him."
The fire fighter was treated in hospital and later discharged, however Mr Lynch warned that arsonists are putting lives at risk.
"I'd just like to remind the public that when they set light to things, they should be mindful of the consequences - it can put the public and indeed the emergency services in danger as they go about their work."
