Mist caused problems early in the day but Dunlop was quickly on the pace with a speed of 121.65mph on his Superstock.
The Ballymoney man then secured pole on the BMW Superbike with 131.783, just faster than Peter Hickman's 131.063.
Neil Kernohan won the Dundrod 150 Lightweight race, with Christian Elkin taking the Ultra-Lightweight honours.
Ballymena rider Kernohan finished ahead of runner-up Davy Morgan, Paul Robinson, Paul Owen and Olie Linsdell.
Elkin repeated his Armoy success of two weeks ago, coming home first on his Moto3 machine, followed by Sam Wilson and Derek McGee on 125cc bikes.
Gary Dunlop, son of the late, legendary Joey, claimed a creditable fourth place on his debut at the event, with female competitor Melissa Kennedy fifth.
Graham Kennedy took the flag in the National race and David Jackson in the Challenge event.
The Dundrod 150 Superbike race was cancelled due to deteriorating visibility after the initial race had been red-flagged following an incident, which was not serious.
The leaders had completed two laps, with Michael Dunlop just in front of Bruce Anstey, Ian Hutchinson and lap-one leader Conor Cummins when proceedings were brought to a halt.
Meanwhile, New Zealander Anstey clocked the fastest time for Saturday's two Supersport races, edging out Yamaha-mounted Hutchinson by 1.7 seconds, with Manxman Cummins third.
The 600cc qualifying session was halted prematurely after an incident at Flow Bog, which resulted in a rider being taken to hospital with non life-threatening injuries.
A seven-race programme is scheduled for Saturday, with roads closing at 09:30 BST.
