The German air raids took place over two nights in December 1940, killing and wounding more than 2,000 people.
A recreation of life in the blitz, including recordings of the raids, has been unveiled at the National Emergency Services Museum.
It was opened by 98-year-old Doug Lightning who worked as a firefighter during the bombing attacks.

Historian and writer Neil Anderson started the campaign to open the exhibition.
He said he was inspired after he found a memoir written by his late grandmother about life in wartime Sheffield.
"It brought to light to me just how little there is to see in Sheffield to commemorate it," said Mr Anderson.
"The fact that nearly a 10th of the city was left homeless. I thought there really should be more to mark these attacks."
The exhibition features World War Two bomb shelters and a fire engine and other equipment used to tackle the fires during the raids.
