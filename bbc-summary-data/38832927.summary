[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The car initially failed to stop for police on Belfast's Falls Road. It was reversed into a police car, injuring two officers inside.
The car was then driven out of Belfast towards Nutts Corner then across country, via Moira and Banbridge.
It was followed by police vehicles from several stations, before being stopped near Newry with a stinger device.
The police helicopter was also used in the pursuit.
PSNI Newry and Mourne said its officers "stung the subject vehicle and a short time later the pursuit ended on Craigmore Way".
In a Facebook post, the force said the cross-country pursuit involved officers from Belfast, Craigavon, Lisburn, Newtownhamilton and Newry.
Officers posted three pictures of the car on social media, adding "When first spotted this car was towing a trailer, not sure what it was connected to tho!"
A 35-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of burglary, driving whilst disqualified, dangerous driving, having no insurance, criminal damage and failing to stop, report and remain at a road traffic collision.
Police think the car may have hit other vehicles and say anyone affected should come forward.
