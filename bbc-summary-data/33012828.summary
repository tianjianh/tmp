Jack Tweed, the widower of reality TV star Jade Goody, has been sentenced for assaulting a McDonald's staff member.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Tweed admitted four offences including assault by beating and criminal damage at Chelmsford Magistrates' Court.
The 27-year-old, from Buckhurst Hill, Essex, was given a community order, 100 hours of unpaid work and told to pay compensation to the staff member.
He was also ordered to pay Â£2.50 to McDonald's to cover damage to cups and napkins at an outlet in the city.
During an appearance at the same court in January, prosecutor Phil Pearson said Mr Tweed had been to the McDonald's outlet in Boreham at around 03:30 BST on 9 October while "under the influence of alcohol".
Mr Pearson said Tweed started to become disorderly and began throwing cups, napkins and other items around with his friends.
Tweed married Big Brother contestant Jade Goody, 27, days before she died from cervical cancer in March 2009.
