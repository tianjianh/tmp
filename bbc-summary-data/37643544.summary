Cronulla Sharks: Five former players receive backdated doping bans

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Five former Cronulla Sharks players have been given 12-month backdated bans for breaching anti-doping rules.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The offences by Paul Aiton, Colin Best, Stuart Flanagan, Ben Pomeroy and John Williams date back to the 2011 National Rugby League season.
Aiton, 31, currently plays in Super League with Catalans Dragons.
An NRL statement said the players "bore no significant fault in the breaches" and the bans have "now expired" owing to the length of the investigation.
A total of 17 players have now been sanctioned following the investigation by the Australian Anti-Doping Authority (Asada).
