Brexit appeal: Crabb comfortable with giving MPs say on Article 50

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Former Welsh Secretary Stephen Crabb has said he is "very comfortable" with the idea of MPs being consulted on when to launch the Brexit process.

The UK government is challenging a High Court ruling that ministers should refer to Parliament before triggering Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty.
That starts the formal two-year process for the UK to leave the European Union.
Mr Crabb said he did not want the process "bogged down" but insisted MPs had the right to scrutinise ministers.
Speaking to The Wales Report on BBC Wales television, the Preseli Pembrokeshire Conservative MP said:  "I am very comfortable with Parliament having a say, 'yes or no', on triggering Article 50 - beginning the process.
"But what I don't want to see is this whole thing getting bogged down with Parliament trying to do what it's not their job to do.
"It's not their job to make the strategy for Brexit but it's their job to scrutinise."
The Supreme Court is allowing the Welsh and Scottish governments to have their say in the four-day appeal hearing due to start on Monday.
Counsel General Mick Antoniw has said that allowing the UK government to act without reference to Parliament could put the powers of the Welsh Assembly at risk.
Mr Crabb said it was right for the Supreme Court to hear this particular case.
"On big constitutional questions, yes, there's an argument on whether Parliament should give the explicit say-so and that's the argument that's going to be happening in the Supreme Court about Brexit.
"As I say, I am comfortable if the outcome is that Parliament should have an explicit vote on that.
"But I don't see that stretching to lots and lots of other areas about governing."
