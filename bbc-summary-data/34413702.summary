[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Daniel Ritchie, 25, of Carrbridge, had earlier admitted causing Greg Anderson's death by driving dangerously on 6 July 2013.
Twenty-one-year-old Mr Anderson was from Kingussie.
Ritchie has also been disqualified from driving for five years. The crash happen on the C1119 near Carrbridge.
Judge Lord Boyd of Duncansby told Ritchie he had driven while his ability to control the car was impaired by the consumption of alcohol, and he drove at grossly excessive speed.
The judge said if Ritchie had been convicted of the offence after a trial he would have jailed him for five years.
Lord Boyd said that he took into account that Ritchie was a first offender, that the person who died was a friend, that he had shown remorse and was also injured in the incident.
The judge said: "You stand in the dock of the High Court because through your actions on 6 July 2013 you are criminally responsible for the death of Greg Anderson."
The judge said he had heard of the impact the death had on Mr Anderson's family and added: "In a small community however his death would have been keenly felt far beyond his family."
Ritchie had written a letter expressing his remorse and Lord Boyd told him: "I have little doubt that if you could turn the clock back you would do that."
The judge said the vehicle involved in the collision, a Vauxhall Corsa fitted with a two-litre engine, was a powerful car.
Lord Boyd said: "He owned it and he drove it. I accept he himself did not modify it."
Mr Anderson and his girlfriend had gone to Carrbridge to attend a 21st birthday party and spent the night socialising.
Ritchie was also at the party and during the course of it mentioned to one witness that he was "feeling quite drunk", the court heard.
One person at the event recalled that Ritchie had offered to show Mr Anderson his car. The two of them then left the party.
A witness noticed a light gold car passing on Carr Road, Carrbridge, at speed and another heard it accelerate.
Sirens were heard a short time later.
Ritchie lost control of the car on the single track road, struck a fence and hit a tree.
