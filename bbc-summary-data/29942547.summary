They're not ready to download yet but we thought we'd mark the moment by telling you some of the week's big stories - in emojis, of course.
Can you work out them out? If you get really stuck, we've put the answers at the bottom of the page.
1 - Beyonce named top-earning woman in music
2 - Benedict Cumberbatch announces engagement in The Times
3 - One Direction criticised for using chimp in Steal My Girl video
4 - David James declares himself bankrupt and auctions possessions
5 - Taylor Swift's entire back catalogue removed from Spotify
6 - Republicans make historic gains in US mid-term elections (In the US the Republicans are often represented by an elephant, while the Democrats are associated with a donkey - or in the case of available emojis - a horse)
7 - Man surfs on dead whale in Australia
