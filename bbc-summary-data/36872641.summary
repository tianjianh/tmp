Allardyce, 61, has signed an initial two-year contract after the FA agreed compensation with Sunderland.
Manchester United striker Rooney, England's all-time leading goalscorer, was part of the squad knocked out of Euro 2016 by Iceland in June.
"He will probably bring a different way of playing to England," he said.
"Hopefully it's a good way and we can be successful under him."
The 30-year-old said he had no intention of retiring from international football.
"Am I going to carry on?" said Rooney, who has scored 53 times for England in 115 appearances. "It was asked of me after the Euros, but yes, I'll be there."
The former Everton striker was speaking during United's pre-season tour of China, which they started with a 4-1 defeat by Borussia Dortmund.
