The collision involving a Toyota Yaris and a Mercedes minibus happened in Avonmouth, Bristol, on Tuesday morning.
Mircea Husarencu, 46, has been bailed to appeal before Bristol Crown Court at a later date.
Natasha May Packman's family described her as a "beautiful daughter" who brought "such smiles and pleasure to those that she encountered".
Their tribute added: "On Tuesday morning we had our little girl, Natasha, taken from us.
"Our only consolation in all of this terrible sadness is that our beautiful daughter did not feel any pain and that she did not suffer during the last few hours of her precious life."
The family said they were grateful to friends and family for their support.
"In all of this there is a heart-breaking sadness for us all, but a knowledge that the world is a good place, full of good people, who show love and kindness."
Police had previously reported the girl was aged three, although her age has now been confirmed as two.
A woman and another child were also injured in the collision and received hospital treatment.
