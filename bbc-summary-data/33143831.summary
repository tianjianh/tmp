Paul O'Connell: Ireland forward signs two-year Toulon deal

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Ireland's Paul O'Connell has completed his two-year deal to join European champions Toulon after the World Cup.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Toulon confirmed on Monday night that the contract had been finalised, just hours before the French transfer deadline.
The 35-year-old second row's farewell match in a Munster shirt was the Pro12 final defeat by Glasgow in May.
He will quit internationals after the World Cup, having won a Grand Slam plus two Six Nations Championships.
The Limerick man had been contracted until June 2016 but the IRFU and Munster agreed to his request for an early release.
O'Connell made his senior Munster debut in August 2001 and won two European Cups, three League titles and a Celtic Cup with the Irish province.
