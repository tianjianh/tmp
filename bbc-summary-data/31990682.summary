[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Antonio Boparan, 28, of Little Aston, Sutton Coldfield and son of the head of the 2 Sisters Food Group, pleaded guilty to violent disorder and assault.
The 22-year-old victim was injured at the Nuovo Bar, Birmingham, last April.
Theodore Mullings-Fairweather, 25, of Dawlish Road, Selly Oak, was jailed for eight years, after pleading guilty at Birmingham Crown Court.
Edward Ansah, 24, of Westwood Road, Sutton Coldfield and Nathan Pringle, 32, of Welshman's Hill, were both jailed for 18 months, after also pleading guilty to the same offence.
The Boparan family issued a statement after the hearing saying the altercation was something their son "deeply regrets" and that he "sincerely apologises for his actions".
Boparan was jailed for dangerous driving in April 2008 after he rammed into a car in Sutton Coldfield in November 2006.
A baby in the car when the crash happened was left paralysed and Boparan, then 19, spent six months in prison.
