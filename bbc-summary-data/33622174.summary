A mystery hero who made a "wheelie-bin ladder" to rescue a woman from a burning house in Greater Manchester has been praised by firefighters.

The man spotted smoke coming from an upstairs window at the house in Tower Street, Heywood about 03:50 BST.
He kicked the door in and rescued one woman, aged about 50, who was trying to extinguish a chip pan fire.
After leading her to safety, he stacked up the bins to help her daughter, 29, as she dangled from a window ledge.
Greater Manchester Fire Service watch manager Colin Moran said: "This guy did a very good job to lead the woman to safety and try and rescue her daughter.
"He had gone to investigate a smoke alarm he could hear. He kicked the door in and kept his head below the smoke as he tried to make contact with people inside."
Firefighters used two hose reels and a high pressure fan to deal with the fire, which damaged the kitchen and caused smoke damage in the rest of the house.
The women were treated for smoke inhalation.
