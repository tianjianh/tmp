Gloucester's Kings Square redevelopment in doubt

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The planned redevelopment of Gloucester's Kings Square is in doubt, the BBC understands.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
It is believed developer Stanhope PLC is considering pulling out of the scheme to create new shops, restaurants and a bus station.
Gloucester City Council unveiled the company in 2011 as a developer and says it is "working with Stanhope" to find a solution.
The company has not commented on the development.
Stanhope signed a contract with the council in 2012 and has until March 2016 to put in a planning application.
That application had been expected in March.
City council leader Paul James said both parties have "obligations" and they are "trying to find the best and the quickest way to deliver a scheme".
Mr James confirmed that the redevelopment of the city's bus station will go ahead as planned.
I've been told that Stanhope PLC is seriously considering the viability of the King Square development.
In 2011 the firm was unveiled as the big hope to finally deliver a scheme for this unloved gateway into Gloucester.
But to make it work the development needed an "anchor" store and the names bandied about from Ikea to John Lewis have not materialised.
Gloucester City Council's leader wouldn't be drawn on if the deal was about to collapse.
But what we do know today is the council is looking at a "plan B" and that plan could see cafes, restaurants and a social space and, dare I say it, the fountains might return.
