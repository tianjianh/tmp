Our season this year featured two weeks of stories about awe-inspiring girls and women - from Siberia, to the US, Venezuela to Palestine - to celebrate 100 of some of the most exciting women in the world, as named by the BBC.

This year's series marked the third year of the 100 Women season, which seeks to better represent women in the BBC's international news output.
It concluded with a live page online, unprecedented in its size.
More than 120 groups across the world came together on the BBC News online to debate the pressures on women to conform, especially around image, leadership and relationships.
Highlights from our live page included:
Our season included a rare glimpse into life as a woman in Raqqa, the so-called Islamic State's (IS) capital inside Syria. We also heard about what it was like to finally be given a name from the girls in India named 'unwanted' at birth.
Nurses in conflict zones from Gaza, Caracas and the Central African Republic told us what is is like working in some of the world's most challenging environments and the numbers behind the profession were bought to life in this neat animation.
Teenagers from Siberia to Syria told us what it means to fit in as a 'good girl' in their society, and revealed what their lives are really like.
We also included several high-profile interviews, such as with US make-up mogul Bobbi Brown. South Sudanese supermodel Alek Wek and American actress Hilary Swank.
And we explored some of the issues facing women today, such as a largely guilt-free abortion, or the decision not to have children.
Our list of the 100 most inspirational women across the world in 2015 included 30 entrepreneurs under the age of 30 and inspiring women over the age of 80.
It spanned the world, from Li Tingting, an openly gay women's rights activist in China, to Eveles Chimala, a midwife in Malawi, Jana el-Hassan, a Lebanese novelist and Megan Grano, an American comedian.
Leaders in science, politics, education and the arts were also included.
