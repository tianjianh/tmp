Kieran McAree, 23, is thought to have gone into the water in Enniskillen, County Fermanagh, on 17 December.
Police divers, as well as voluntary search teams, have extended the search area to beyond Devenish Island.
His family said they have not given up hope that his body will be found.
Martin McAree, his father, said: "Every day seems to be different. You come down with so much hope and then you just leave but the amount of support from home, from people from Enniskillen, everybody - it's been great.
"It's carrying us through this. We just can't thank people enough. People from home, from around here, have given up Christmas, they've given up New Year and now we're into the working week again and they're still turning out.
"It's just unbelievable."
Geraldine McAree, Kieran's mother, said: "We're going to bring Kieran home. Whatever length it takes to find him, we'll take him home where he belongs.
"It just shows here what friends Kieran has, because around north and south of the border they are all here supporting him. That just shows what kind of fella he was.
"If he's sick and wandering around, we'll still put our arms around him and tell him to come home, we love him.
"Not knowing is eating us up inside."
Kieran had been suffering from mental health problems and had raised 5,600 euro for Aware Defeat Depression.
Mrs McAree said: "The first year when he was sick he didn't say anything about it but the second year he told people.
"He helped young people who had problems to notify if they had a problem, to go and see about themselves.
"That's the type that Kieran was -  to help others and never think of himself sometimes just to help somebody else along."
Kieran's uncle, Sean Treanor, paid tribute to the "bus loads" of volunteers who had joined the search, as well as local people who were providing them with food.
He said volunteer search teams had come from as far as Coleraine, County Londonderry, and Athlone, County Westmeath.
