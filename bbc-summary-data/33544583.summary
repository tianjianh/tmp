There's a female humanoid and a dinosaur robot at reception to welcome and check guests in.
Another robot is on hand to carry the guest's bags.
The Henn na Hotel, which in English means weird hotel, has a facial recognition system, which allows guests to enter their room without having to use a key.
And a high-tech system in the rooms senses how hot or cold guests are and adjusts the room temperature accordingly.
