Williams, who plays for Scottish Premiership side Inverness Caledonian Thistle FC, was with the team for this summer's tournament in France.
His canvas portrays the team's celebrations at winning a historic appearance in the semi finals.
Williams' other artwork has been inspired by the landscape and culture of Dyffryn Nantlle, where he grew up.
It includes paintings of slate quarries near where he lived in north west Wales.
Since moving to Inverness, he has also created paintings of Highland cattle.
Williams spent five months planning and painting the Euro 2016 canvas called Together Stronger.
