[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The striker's penalty, which went in off the inside of the post, doubled the Daggers' lead in the first half after Corey Whitely had been illegally checked inside the area.
Jordan Maguire-Drew's shot also went in off the frame of the goal in only the second minute, setting the tone for the hosts to dominate.
Dagenham did not have it all their own way, and striker Fejiri Okenabirhie had to be sharp to clear off his own goal line from a scramble in the second half.
