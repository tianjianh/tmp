The retail giant has spent almost 90 years on the British high street, but went into administration in April.
Attempts to find a buyer were unsuccessful and BHS was wound up in June with the loss of 11,000 jobs.
Carmarthen's BHS is one of 30 UK stores closing on Saturday. It follows 20 store closures last week, including the one in Newport.
BHS also has stores in Swansea, Cardiff Bay, Wrexham and Llandudno.
Speaking to BBC Radio Wales, customers in Carmarthen said they were "sad to see it go."
One woman said the closure was "a disaster" for the town.
"They (BHS) had a big store, and who is going to take on a store of this size?" she asked.
Retail expert Kate Hardcastle told the programme that "retail has changed phenomenally" over the last 20 years with the emergence of out-of-town and online shopping.
"15 to 20% of all of our purchases are now online and that's growing day by day," said Ms Hardcastle.
"We only need to see the success of organisations like Amazon to know that."
She described the downfall of BHS as "a very sad spectacle" for the people who shopped there, the people who worked there and those that supplied the brand.
Ms Hardcastle added that she did not think that most people would miss BHS on the high street.
She put that down to consumers "embracing the freedom and power they have to find the items they want, to buy the best price and to accept deliveries from all types of organisations with worldwide offerings."
