[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Clattenburg, 41, is to become the new head of referees in Saudi Arabia and was expected to leave immediately.
However, the Premier League has confirmed he will take charge of Saturday's match between West Brom and Bournemouth at The Hawthorns.
Clattenburg, a Fifa referee since 2006, is widely considered to be one of the best officials in world football.
He took charge of the Euro 2016 final, the Champions League final and the FA Cup final last season.
