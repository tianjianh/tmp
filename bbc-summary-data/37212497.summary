Oliver Dearlove collapsed on Tranquil Vale, Blackheath at 00:45 BST on Sunday after he was hit while waiting for a pre-booked taxi with friends.
The 30-year-old from Eltham was taken to an east London hospital where he died at 22:30 that evening.
The Met said it had made "significant progress". No arrests have been made.
The force said it had spoken to the four women who were speaking to Mr Dearlove and "witness accounts indicate that a man approached the group and then struck Oliver".
Det Ch Insp Lee Watling has appealed for any witnesses who were in Blackheath to come forward.
"Oliver's family, his girlfriend and friends have been left devastated by his death and deserve to know what happened to him," he said.
Comedian Rob Beckett tweeted that Mr Dearlove was his best friend growing up and urged anyone with information to contact police.
A post-mortem examination gave a provisional cause of death as intracranial haemorrhage (bleeding within the skull), the Met said.
