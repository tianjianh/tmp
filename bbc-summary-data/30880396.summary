Yvonne Davies, 46, was found stabbed in the kitchen at the property in Meadway Road, Cheadle Hulme, on Friday.
Post-mortem tests found she died from multiple stab wounds and Andrew Davies, 45, was deemed to have died of asphyxiation due to hanging.
Paying tribute, Ms Davies's family said they were "heartbroken".
"Yvonne was a wonderful wife, mother, sister, daughter and friend.
"She had a successful career but still managed to be a devoted mother who raised an amazing, beautiful daughter who is an absolute credit to both her parents."
Ms Davies was a magistrate at Manchester Magistrates' Court and head of communications and PR at the Central University Hospitals Trust in Manchester, where she had worked for more than 20 years.
Greater Manchester Police said they did not believe there was any "third-party involvement" in the deaths.
A statement from Mr Davies's family said he was an "incredibly loving father who took five years out of work to spend time caring for his daughter.
"What happened that day was totally out of character for Andrew and none of us, family or friends can believe what has happened.
"Our hearts go out to Yvonne's family, we are devastated for them."
Mr Davies's family also said:  "We are also heartbroken for our niece Emma, who has lost two loving parents."
