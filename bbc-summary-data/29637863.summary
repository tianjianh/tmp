And from next year Friends fans, well those based in North America at least, will be able to binge on all 236 episodes on Netflix.
The site told Newsbeat there are "no plans for it in the UK as of yet".
The announcement, which was made on Twitter, comes weeks after the series celebrated its 20th anniversary.
The Netflix post featured The Rembrants performing the theme song I'll be there for you, as well as Gunther, who is played by James Michael Tyler, in a familiar pose behind the coffee bar at Central Perk.
The sitcom will arrive on Netflix is the US and Canada on 1 January 2015.
Currently repeats of the show are shown on Comedy Central in the UK and the channel celebrated 20 years of the comedy by counting down the top 50 episodes.
So whether you're a mega-fan or just dipping your toe in for the first time, it looks like UK viewers will have to wait to stream the whole 10 seasons online.
