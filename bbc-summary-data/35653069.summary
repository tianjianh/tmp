Mark Coshever, 39, of Eaton Place, Beaconsfield, Buckinghamshire, admitted "affray" and entering the field of play at the Southend Roots Hall ground earlier this month.
Coshever was given an eight-week sentence, suspended for 12 months.
Southend magistrates also gave him a five-year football banning order.
