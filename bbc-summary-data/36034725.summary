Souths won their first premiership in 43 years in 2014 and have the English trio of Burgess brothers - Sam, George and Thomas - in their side.
The Australian has spent seven years at the RFL, of which the past two were served as general manager.
"This is a fantastic opportunity to join one of the best," Solly said.
"South Sydney Rabbitohs are a powerhouse on and off the field, the most successful club in NRL history with a passionate fan base and extremely strong board.
"It will be tough to leave a great group of people at the RFL and Super League, and I would like to thank the staff, clubs and fans for their support."
Rabbitohs chairman Nicholas Pappas said: "His experience in managing one of the code's largest professional bodies internationally, coupled with his background in the legal profession, is a perfect mix for our club."
Solly will replace interim chief executive Shannon Donato at Redfern, and will link up with former Gateshead Thunder owner Shane Richardson, who is general manager.
Marketing director Mark Foster serve as interim Super League general manager while the RFL begin the search for a successor.
