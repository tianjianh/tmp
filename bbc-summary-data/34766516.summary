Commonwealth Games gold medallist Libby Clegg has lost her funding from UK Athletics after pulling out of the recent IPC World Championships.

The 25-year-old visually-impaired sprinter was not selected for the 2015-16 world class performance programme.
Anguilla-born sprinter Zharnel Hughes, who had his GB eligibility confirmed in June, was granted full funding.
Scottish steeplechaser Eilish McColgan said it is "no wonder athletes cheat" after her own funding was cut.
Clegg pulled out of the IPC World Championships in Doha last month after injuring her foot during a warm-up, having also been forced out of last year's European Championships through illness.
Fellow Scot McColgan, 24, has endured a similarly tough year, missing the entire 2015 season after breaking her ankle in January.
Selection for UK Athletics' world class performance programme (WCPP) is based on an athlete's potential to win Olympic or Paralympic medals and funded by the National Lottery through UK Sport.
The WCPP is split into two levels for both Olympic and Paralympic athletes:
Sprinter Dina Asher-Smith has been rewarded for her breakthrough 2015 season by receiving full funding for the first time.
The 19-year-old finished fifth in the 200m at the World Championships in Beijing in August, one month after she also became the first British woman to run under 11 seconds in the 100m.
Former 400m hurdles world champion Dai Greene, who failed to qualify for Beijing, is one of 21 athletes chosen for the Olympic podium programme.
He is joined by London 2012 gold medallists Jessica Ennis-Hill, Mo Farah and Greg Rutherford.
Hughes, 20, was born in the British overseas territory of Anguilla but opted to compete for Great Britain with his home country not recognised by the International Olympic Committee.
The highly-rated sprinter receives full funding at the first attempt, having won the Lausanne Diamond league 200m race in July.
Paralympic gold medallists Richard Whitehead and Jonnie Peacock are on a list of 25 Paralympic athletes receiving podium funding, with world championship medallists Georgie Hermitage, Kadeena Cox, Dan Bramall, Toby Gold and Abbie Hunnisett also included for the first time.
Alongside Clegg and McColgan, middle-distance runner Hannah England and 110m hurdler Lawrence Clarke lost their Olympic level funding.
Perri Shakes-Drayton, a former European indoor 400m gold medallist, and European 100m champion James Dasaolu also saw their support cut back from the Olympic level to the relay programmes.
Six-time Paralympic gold medallist David Weir is not included after opting out of the funding system last year.
Former 3,000m steeplechase British champion McColgan revealed UK Athletics' decision on social media prior to the official announcement, adding "My current financial status..." above an image of chocolate coins.
Scottish 800m runner Lynsey Sharp was also critical of the governing body despite making the podium programme, saying she had received "no email" to confirm her selection.
