A man is due to appear in court over the death of student Karen Buckley, whose body was found on a farm near Glasgow four days after she was reported missing.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 21-year-old man is expected to make a brief appearance during a private hearing at Glasgow Sheriff Court later.
Miss Buckley went missing following a night out at the Sanctuary nightclub in Glasgow's West End on Saturday.
Her body was found by police at a farm to the north of the city.
A candlelit vigil will be held in Glasgow's George Square from 17:00 on Friday in memory of Miss Buckley, who was from Cork in Ireland.
Organisers said the vigil would show that the people of Glasgow stood with Miss Buckley's family. Those attending are being encouraged to bring flowers and candles.
An explanation of the vigil, organised via Facebook, reads: "As folk will have seen Karen Buckley from Cork in Ireland was taken from her family and friends this week.
"Our hearts are breaking for her and sadly we have another enormous painful space in this city."
A separate event titled Silent Vigil For Our Neighbour Karen Buckley has been organised to take place in the Garnethill area of the city, where Miss Buckley lived, on Saturday.
Miss Buckley had been seen on CCTV leaving the Sanctuary nightclub with a man in the early hours of Sunday. Her friends raised the alarm after she failed to return to her flat in Hill Street.
Specialist police divers, a helicopter crew and search dogs were all involved in the search for the qualified nurse, who moved to Glasgow in February to study occupational therapy at Glasgow Caledonian University (GCU).
Her handbag was discovered in Dawsholm Park, in the Kelvinside area of the city, on Tuesday and officers later began searching land around High Craigton Farm near Milngavie.
It was announced in the early hours of Thursday that officers had found a body at the farm, which was later confirmed to be Miss Buckley.
Speaking at a police media conference on Thursday, Det Supt Jim Kerr said: "We cannot imagine the pain and suffering of Karen's family and friends and our thoughts are with them at this very sad and distressing time."
The police officer thanked members of the public in Ireland and Scotland for their assistance, and described their efforts as "very, very helpful".
Det Supt Kerr also read a statement on behalf of Karen's father John.
It said: "Marian and I, together with our sons Brendan, Kieran and Damian, are absolutely heartbroken.
"Karen was our only daughter, cherished by our family and loved by her friends. She was an outgoing girl who travelled the world where she met lots of people and thoroughly enjoyed her life. We will miss her terribly.
"We would be very grateful if we could now be left alone to grieve with her family and friends."
A special prayer service was held near her home in Mallow on Wednesday, and a fundraising page set up by Miss Buckley's former classmates to support her family has raised more than Â£50,000.
