[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Raymond Bell, 29, repeatedly kicked and stamped on David Black's head during the attack in Rutherglen, South Lanarkshire, on 1 November last year.
Mr Black was left in a persistent vegetative state and requires round-the-clock nursing care.
Bell denied the attack but was convicted of attempted murder.
Jailing him at the High Court in Livingston, temporary judge John Morris told Bell: "The jury convicted you of attempted murder and as you'll appreciate that's a very serious offence.
"In this particular case you'll also appreciate the consequences of your actions were very grave indeed for the victim.
"Although the victim is still alive he'll continue to have no quality of life whatsoever. In those circumstances, you'll appreciate only a substantial sentence is appropriate in your case."
Bell was also told he would be supervised for three years following his release from prison.
