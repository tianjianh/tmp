Pre-tax profit for the six months to the end of February was £21.2m compared with £18m a year earlier.
The results are the first under new chief executive Nick Beighton.
Asos said the half-year figure was in line with expectations and maintained its outlook for the year.
The online retailer reported a 17% rise in active customers to 10.9 million people.
The UK market remained its strongest, with sales up 25% to £289.5m, accounting for almost half of the firm's revenue. International sales rose 24% to £359.1m.
Mr Beighton said: "We've had a good start to the year and I'm pleased with progress on a number of fronts. These results demonstrate improving momentum in the business with group sales up 21% (25% in constant currency)."
Nick Robertson, the founder of Asos, stood down in September last year after 15 years at the helm. although he remains on the company's board as a non-executive director.
