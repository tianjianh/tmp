The Frenchman, 35, opted to extend his contract with the Royals in February until June 2018, having joined from Bournemouth in January 2016.
"It's a decision I took with my family, who I've been away from now for 13 years," he told BBC Radio Berkshire.
"We just think it's a good time for me to get back home and start a new life. I'm building a house in France."
Kermorgant, who also played for Leicester and Charlton, has scored 10 goals for Reading so far this season as they bid to secure a Championship play-off place.
He will hope to play a key role when Jaap Stam's side face fellow promotion contenders Leeds at home on Saturday.
"I think it will be a big game," Kermorgant said. "There's every chance we could meet again in May if we both stay in our current positions.
"It will be a good test for us to see where we can be. We want to finish as high as we can and we've been third in the league for a long time.
"If we can beat Leeds, that will take us to fourth and maybe we can push for more."
