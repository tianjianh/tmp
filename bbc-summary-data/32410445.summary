[SN]TITLE[SN]
Agreement in principle in Hial staff pay dispute

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An agreement in principle has been reached on a written offer to resolve a long-running dispute on airport security workers' pay.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Highlands and Islands Airports Limited (Hial) made the offer which was discussed in a meeting with the Prospect union.
More than 120 staff held a 48-hour strike earlier this month which led to the closure of Dundee Airport.
Hial's other 10 sites continued to operate during the action.
Members of Prospect have been in a dispute over their pay and conditions for the past six years.
Hial operates 11 Scottish airports in Dundee, Inverness, Argyll, the Hebrides, Orkney and Shetland and Wick.
Inglis Lyon, managing director of Hial, said: "A revised offer was made to Prospect today which we understand will be the subject of a consultative ballot.
"Both parties have compromised and in so doing have secured some long term stability for the business."
He added: "We are pleased at the progress we have made and believe that the agreement reached today delivers a balanced package of improvements to pay and conditions for security staff."
Prospect said it would begin balloting members at the end of this week, with the ballot closing on 5 May. A work to rule action will be suspended.
Alan Denney, Prospect national secretary, said: "We believe this offer provides a realistic opportunity to settle our long-running dispute with Hial over the unequal treatment of our members.
"If agreed, there will be an alignment of terms and conditions over the next 20 months."
