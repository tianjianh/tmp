The 24-year-old New Zealand international has moved to Wire with immediate effect and is the second mid-season signing in the past week after they brought in Ben Pomeroy.
Hiku started his career at Manly Sea Eagles and was in his second season at Penrith.
"He's a high quality player with plenty of experience," said coach Tony Smith.
"To come up with a quality signing like Peta is very exciting. He will add a lot to the group."
