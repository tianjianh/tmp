England and Pakistan announce UAE tour dates

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
England and Pakistan have arranged October and November dates for their two-month autumn tour in the United Arab Emirates.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The series will include three Tests, four one-day internationals and three Twenty20 internationals, with England arriving in the UAE on 30 September.
The first Test starts at Abu Dhabi's Zayed Cricket Stadium on 13 October.
Pakistan have not played Test cricket at home since a 2009 attack on the Sri Lanka team bus killed seven people.
In May, they hosted Zimbabwe in a five-match series comprising two Twenty20 games and three one-day internationals.
The second Test of the autumn tour will be at Dubai Cricket Stadium from 22-26 October with the third held at the Sharjah Cricket Club, where England have never played a Test.
England's last tour to the UAE in 2012 saw Pakistan win the Test series while England triumphed in the ODIs and T20S.
