[SN]TITLE[SN]
Motherwell 0-0 Hamilton Academical

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Hamilton Academical overcame Darian MacKinnon's red card to hold Lanarkshire rivals Motherwell to a goalless stalemate at Fir Park.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Well's Ryan Bowman squandered a huge first-half chance, before Accies' Alex D'Acol struck the post then cleared Ben Heneghan's header off the line.
MacKinnon saw red after 74 minutes for apparent dissent towards the home fans, but Well could not capitalise.
The Steelmen remain 10th in the Premiership, a point above Accies.

Brace yourself for another couple of days of debate over whether Scottish football should introduce goal-line technology.
The pivotal incident on the half-hour mark came when Heneghan's bullet header from a corner was cleared by Hamilton front-man D'Acol. Whether that clearance occurred on or behind the line was the contentious issue.
Motherwell players surrounded referee Kevin Clancy as play resumed and it prompted a flurry of activity from the home backroom staff - including chief operating officer Alan Burrows - to try and obtain some footage to decide for themselves.
The photo Burrows retrieved suggested the ball was at least partly over the line, but left it hard to tell if it had completely crossed. With the sides only a point apart and battling the threat of relegation going into this contest, the incident certainly happened at a critical juncture of the season.
That controversial moment was in the middle of a first half which Motherwell edged, although Accies had a few decent chances through MacKinnon, D'Acol and Rakish Bingham.
One of the Steelmen's stars was the grafting Bowman, who has only scored one goal in 17 appearances for Motherwell so far, yet contributes in the forward areas in significant ways.
Bowman ran Hamilton ragged at times down the right, with Scott McMann not given enough help in his defensive duties on that flank as the hosts attacked.
The Englishman is tidy on the deck, can pick out a pass and possesses good physicality and heading ability in the air. The likes of Scott McDonald and Louis Moult may have grabbed more goals this campaign, but many of them come because of Bowman's hard work.
In saying that though, Bowman should have had one of his own in this match, screwing wide from five yards after McDonald's 10-yard shot was blocked.
The second half failed to live up to the first in terms of goalmouth action, with the ultimate stalemate the hosts' first clean sheet in 16 attempts.
Motherwell's Elliott Frear watched his tasty half-volley drift wide and Massimo Donati stung the palms of Craig Samson for the visitors.
The next talking point turned out to be the confusing red card issued to MacKinnon, who was dismissed after a break in play while a Motherwell player received treatment.
Speculation in the ground suggested MacKinnon might have got involved in gesturing towards a home fan, which was subsequently spotted by the assistant referee.
Whatever happened, Accies boss Martin Canning will surely be livid that one of his key players has failed to keep his cool at a period of the season he needs everyone to help stave off any threat of dropping down to the Championship.
Motherwell manager Stephen Robinson: "We're happy we've kept a clean sheet - we've become an organised side in the last few weeks. But we had enough chances to put the game out of reach for them.

"We had one potentially that was over the line. Unfortunately until the referees get some help it's an impossible task for them with the speed of the game. It's difficult to take when you know you should've won the game.
"It crossed the line but it wasn't given and we had to get on with it. In the second half we went too long.
"Ryan Bowman was our man of the match - he was outstanding and I'm sure the goals will come."
Hamilton Academical manager Martin Canning: "When you come away from home in a derby and given we finished the last part of the game with 10 men, then I think it's a good point for us. Having won Saturday and got a point tonight, it keeps up the momentum.
"I thought it was a good game and you could see both teams were giving their all.
"Alex D'Acol was of the opinion he managed to get it off the line. It's difficult for linesmen and referees to make these calls but you hope over the season they even themselves out.
"Darian's said that he made a gesture so if that's the case then it's completely silly from a guy of his experience. He knows better than that. One thing Darian's done this season more than any other, is been really disciplined on the park. So he's let himself and the boys down because he'll miss two games. For him to do that was criminal from his point of view."
