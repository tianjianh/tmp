Ray Wong, 22, co-founded the group Hong Kong Indigenous which advocates for more autonomy for Hong Kong from China.
Scores of people have been arrested in connection with the violence.
On 8 February, police tried to clear illegal food stalls sparking a backlash from those who see them as integral to Chinese New Year celebrations.
Mr Wong, who is due to appear in court later on Tuesday, was arrested on Sunday in a public housing flat along with a 28-year-old man.

Local media say more than 70 people have been arrested in connection with the Mong Kok clashes, which saw protesters throwing bricks and bottles while police used batons and pepper spray.
More than 90 people were injured.
The unrest was the largest of its kind since massive pro-democracy street protests were held in 2014.
Hong Kong Indigenous is one of several groups in the city's so-called "localist" movement which stands against what it perceives as Beijing's growing influence over Hong Kong.
The other co-founder of the group, Edward Leung, had earlier also been charged with rioting.
