The 37-year-old man, named locally as Czeslaw Dudek from Feltham, west London, was taking part in the Weybridge 10k run on Sunday.
He collapsed in Walton Lane close to Weybridge Health Club, South East Coast Ambulance Service (Secamb) said.
Mr Dudek was treated by race medical officials and ambulance paramedics about 400m from the finish line.
He was taken to St Peter's Hospital, Chertsey, in a life-threatening condition, a Secamb spokesman said.
He was pronounced dead on arrival, race organisers said.
In an online tribute, his friend Ilona Bienkowska said: "He was a loving and caring dad and husband."
She said he had left a wife and a seven-year-old daughter.
