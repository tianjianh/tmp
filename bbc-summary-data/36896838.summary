Surrey avenged their 2015 One-Day Cup final defeat by Gloucestershire with a thumping 165-run win at the Oval.

Surrey piled up 323-8 thanks to half-centuries from Steven Davies (79), Rory Burns (50) and Sam Curran (57), while Liam Norwell took three wickets.
Curran also shared a stand of 89 with brother Tom to propel Surrey past 300.
The visitors slumped to 158 all out in just the 34th over, with Surrey skipper Gareth Batty taking 5-41 and paceman Jade Dernbach claiming 3-33.
Gloucestershire beat Surrey by six runs in last September's showpiece at Lord's despite Dernbach taking a career-best 6-35 including a hat-trick.
The right-arm fast bowler found himself on a hat-trick once again early in the Gloucestershire chase when he removed Michael Klinger and debutant Phil Mustard, but Ian Cockbain survived the next ball.
Cockbain (35) and Hamish Marshall (55) led a brief recovery from 24-3 with a stand of 85, but both fell when well set and Gloucestershire lost their last seven wickets for 49 with Batty's spin doing the damage.
The Curran brothers showed their ability with the bat in Surrey's innings - their seventh-wicket partnership coming at almost eight runs an over to take the hosts from 215-6 to 304-7.
