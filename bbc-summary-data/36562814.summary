Man admits role in Scottish Cup Final disorder

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man has admitted assault and disorder charges following violent scenes at the end of last month's Scottish Cup Final at Hampden Park in Glasgow.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
At Glasgow Sheriff Court, John Galbraith, 31, from Dumbarton, admitted running on to the pitch and assaulting two opposition fans and a steward.
Sentence on Galbraith was deferred and he was granted bail on the condition he does not attend any football games.
Three other men denied charges at the same court and were granted bail.
Gary Bain, 40, from Pollok, Glasgow, is accused of running on to the field after the final whistle towards an opposition fan, raising his fist and behaving in an aggressive manner towards him.
Mark Hendry, 42, from Shettleston, Glasgow, is alleged to have entered the field, seized a corner flag pole and repeatedly swung the flag and hit opposition fans with it.
Steven Morrison, 21, from Swinton, Glasgow, is accused of climbing a barrier and running on to the pitch, shouting, gesticulating at opposition supporters, singing sectarian songs and fighting with rival fans.
Each of the men were granted bail with the conditions they did go to any UK match and trials were set for January next year.
The scenes of disorder at Hampden unfolded after Hibernian won their first Scottish Cup Final in 114 years.
Thousands of Hibs fans invaded the pitch and there were reports of alleged assaults on Rangers players.
A number of Rangers fans also came on to the pitch and clashed with rival fans.
The pitch invasion delayed the presentation of the trophy and there was no lap of honour for Hibs players.
Rangers players were not able to pick up their cup final medals.
