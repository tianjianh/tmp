[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
David Thompson, 80, was the oldest of the 38 people who died when a gunman opened fire on a beach in the resort of Sousse.
A private funeral service was held in his home village of Tadley.
In his address, the Reverend Richard Harlow said: "there are no words which can soften either the manner or the suddenness of David's death."
The funeral service was held at St Paul's Church, close to Mr Thompson's home on The Green.
A book of condolence had been opened at the church following the death of the retired atomic scientist.
Mr Harlow told the congregation of Mr Thompson's skill as a woodworker as well as his love of keeping fit, dancing and travel.
"We are all left speechless by such evil. We give thanks to God for David's life, love and kindness.
"We treasure the man he was and the memories he leaves behind," he said.
