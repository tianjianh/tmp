The LÉ Róisín was deployed by the Italian Maritime Rescue Co-ordination Centre to find the migrants' boat off the Libyan coast on Thursday morning.
The rescue began at 06.50 local time and within three hours, the crew had taken 111 people on board, giving them food, water and medical treatment.
Two women had died before the rescue.
Their bodies were taken out of the long rubber boat and placed on board the LÉ Róisín.
The Irish naval ship is now sailing to Port of Lampedusa where the survivors will be placed in the care of the Italian authorities.
The LÉ Róisín left Cork in the Republic of Ireland on 2 May to join the international search and rescue operation in the Mediterranean.
Before Thursday's operation, the ship had rescued 782 people to date.
A note on terminology: The BBC uses the term migrant to refer to all people on the move who have yet to complete the legal process of claiming asylum. This group includes people fleeing war-torn countries such as Syria, who are likely to be granted refugee status, as well as people who are seeking jobs and better lives, who governments are likely to rule are economic migrants.
