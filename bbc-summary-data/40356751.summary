East Yorkshire's 'most prolific' fly-tipper jailed

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man described as the most prolific fly-tipper in East Yorkshire has been jailed for a series of offences.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Darren Armishaw, 49, from Hull, advertised as a commercial waste disposal service, but dumped the rubbish across East Yorkshire.
He was jailed for 10 months after pleading guilty at Hull Crown Court to a string of waste disposal offences.
In addition, he was sent to prison for a further five years after admitting a number of distraction burglaries.

The court heard he and another man, Christopher Harrison, 34, drove around west Hull knocking on the doors of elderly people and telling them somebody was trying to break into their garden sheds.
The men then entered the houses. In one case the pair stole Â£1,000 from a man who was saving up the money to take his his terminally ill wife on holiday.
Harrison was jailed for five years for the burglaries.
Paul Abbott from East Riding of Yorkshire Council said he was "really pleased" at Armishaw's jailing.
"Mr Armishaw is the most prolific fly-tipper that we've ever caught," he said.
"He's been dumping at various locations across the East Riding. He's dumped mattresses, freezers, other household items."
Sentencing Armishaw for the fly-tipping offences, the judge said: "You show persistent contempt for the law, the environment, the landowners and the appearance of an area of which people are very proud.
"The public will be bewildered at your callous disregard for the environment in which they live."
