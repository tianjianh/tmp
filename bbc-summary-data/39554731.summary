Psychiatrist Brian Harris cleared of sex assault and rape

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A south Wales psychiatrist has been cleared by a jury of a sexual assault and a rape claim.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Dr Brian Harris, 77, worked for the NHS and in a private practice in Cardiff for 40 years.
His trial at Merthyr Crown Court had heard allegations of rape during consultations and of him getting a patient addicted to prescription drugs.
The jury has yet to reach verdicts on 11 other charges of sexual assault and rape against four other men.
The not-guilty decisions followed 19 hours of deliberation.
Dr Harries was cleared of an indecent assault claim dating back to 1991 and a rape allegation in 2009.
The four-week trial had heard claims a patient at Sully Hospital and the Amy Evans clinic in Barry, Vale of Glamorgan had been assaulted in 1991, and a second man had been assaulted at Sully a year later.
The jury also heard from a third alleged victim who gave evidence he had been raped and sexually assaulted at the Trealaw clinic and the Royal Glamorgan Hospital in Rhondda Cynon Taff between 2009 and 2011.
Dr Harris did not give evidence in his own defence after he was assessed by a psychologist who concluded he was likely to have experienced significant cognitive decline and a fall in his ability to recall.
The judge has told the jury he would accept a majority verdict on the outstanding charges.
