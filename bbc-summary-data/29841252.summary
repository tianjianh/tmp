Museums, business centres and libraries are among the buildings to benefit from the £12.6m investment in Wales.
Other buildings to house the hotspots include Cardiff Castle, Central Library, City Hall and St David's Hall.
Cardiff is the first Welsh city to take part in the £150m scheme to rollout superfast broadband across the UK.
UK Digital Economy Minister Ed Vaizey said: "The digital landscape of the UK is undergoing a period of tremendous improvement and is all part of the government's long-term economic plan.
"For business, visitors and the UK public, accessing wi-fi in our cities is absolutely vital."
Wales Office Minister Alun Cairns said he wanted Cardiff to have "world-class internet connectivity" so the city could take full advantage of the demands of the digital age.
He added: "It's great news that 30 public buildings across the city are set to be fitted with free wi-fi.
"This is a big boost for our capital city and will make Cardiff an even more attractive place to live, work and invest in."
