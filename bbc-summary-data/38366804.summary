Trevor Bayliss: England coach says his side have good times ahead

England coach Trevor Bayliss says his side have "good times ahead", despite their series defeat in India.

England, who have lost five of their past seven Tests, are 3-0 down and face a battle to avoid defeat in the fifth and final Test in Chennai.
"There have been enough good things to come out of this series," said Bayliss, who is returning to Australia on Monday for treatment on a hernia.
"The experience here in different conditions will help our guys."
England's struggle in India has largely been down to being out-performed by India's batsmen and spin bowlers.
The tourists have used five different spinners, while the poor form of Gary Ballance and Ben Duckett resulted in wicketkeeper Jos Buttler being used as a specialist batsman.
"I don't think I'd have done too much different," Bayliss told BBC Sport.
"If you want to win over here, you have to bowl some good spin. We played three spinners in the first three games, but that didn't work, so everyone was calling for an extra pace bowler, so we did that in the fourth game and that didn't work either.
"Sometimes you get it right, sometimes you don't, but whoever you pick, whether it's a batter or a bowler, they've got to play well. We could have obviously batted and bowled a little bit better."
The fourth day of the fifth match in Chennai was perhaps the toughest of the series so far, with Karun Nair making a triple century to take India to 759-7 declared, their highest Test total and the largest made by any team against England.
"It was just one of those days that you hope doesn't happen too often," said Bayliss. "India played extremely well.
"Alastair Cook, the captain, tried everything but you have to bowl to the fields and once India got in it was a fantastic innings.
"It's a difficult day for everyone in the changing room but they will come out on the fifth day and it will be a test of their character."
Though Bayliss has left the Test tour early, he will return to India for three one-day internationals and three Twenty20s after Christmas.
"I had a hernia operation during the season and it's a bit of a follow-up to that," he said.
"I was going home to Sydney on the fifth night, but unfortunately the clinic's shut before Christmas so I've got to get home tonight to get that looked at and then come back over."
