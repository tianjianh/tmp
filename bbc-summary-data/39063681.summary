Rovers accepted a £25,000 fine, of which £20,000 will be suspended, for breaching three operational rules.
The Red Devils were fined £10,000 for two breaches, with £7,500 suspended, but a £3,000 fine has been added from a previous suspended breach after crowd problems in a match at Huddersfield.
Salford won a dramatic game 19-18.
In the final game of The Qualifiers both teams were playing for a place in Super League in 2017, dubbed the Million Pound Game.
Fans invaded the pitch after Salford's Gareth O'Brien kicked a golden-point drop-goal to secure the win in extra time.
Both clubs were also ordered to pay the costs of the investigation, which came to £2,048.86 each.
