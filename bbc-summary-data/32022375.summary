Speaking at Liberty University in Virginia, Mr Cruz is one of several Republican hopefuls to emerge from the Tea Party movement.
He described his mission as "reigniting the promise of America" because "for so many Americans the promise of America seems more and more distant".
He is the first high-profile Republican to officially enter the 2016 race.
Mr Cruz urged Americans to rise up and say: "We demand our liberty."
The speech followed a middle-of-the-night campaign announcement on Twitter.
Making an appeal to cultural conservatives and religious Republicans, he said: "Our rights don't come from man but from God Almighty."
The junior Senator from Texas talked the crowd through his childhood and religious faith before moving on to lay out his political agenda.

Many of the students present at the speech were required to be there, CNN reported.
Since his election to the US Senate in 2012, Mr Cruz has developed a reputation for being an uncompromising conservative willing to challenge Democrats as well as his fellow Republicans and has garnered the adoration of many anti-establishment Republicans.
The Texas senator has proven himself at times to be a thorn in the side of his party's leaders and senior members.
Mr Cruz spoke on the Senate floor for over 21 hours in a marathon speech that contributed to the 2013 government shutdown and was aimed at encouraging his fellow lawmakers to repeal the president's healthcare reform, nicknamed Obamacare.
The speech included a reading of Dr Seuss' "Green Eggs and Ham" to his daughters, who were said to be watching their father on television.
He later joked that the event featured hours of his "favourite sound" - his own voice.
Before entering politics, Mr Cruz worked as a high-profile lawyer representing the State of Texas before the Supreme Court. He also taught law in Texas.
