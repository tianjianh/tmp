The portraits of David Cameron, Ed Miliband, Nick Clegg, Nigel Farage and Natalie Bennett have been drawn by Birmingham artist Annemarie Wright.
Miss Wright said she had used tweets that ranged from compliments to condemnation to create the works.
The portraits will feature in an exhibition at the Woolff Gallery in central London from 30 April to 15 May.
Miss Wright said: "Everybody has their own opinion on this general election and we live in a world made smaller by social media.
"Many of the party leaders themselves used social media so it was an ideal place to find people's thoughts."
She said the exhibition, called What do you think of?, was her attempt to take a snapshot of people's thoughts on what she said was an "exciting" election.
She collected the opinions by setting up a Twitter account for each subject and following relevant hashtags between November 2014 and February 2015.
She then drew portraits of the leaders before writing the opinions over the top of them.
She said the opinions, "range from vaguely complimentary to absolute condemnation".
Each work took her between 30 and 40 hours to produce.
The five party leaders will be joined by life-sized portraits of the Queen, Baroness Thatcher, Winston Churchill and Nelson Mandela, all composed from some of their most famous speeches.
Miss Wright, who studied at the University of Wolverhampton, has previously created a similar portrait of Sir Alex Ferguson made from the names of every player who played for him.
The singer Adele has also commissioned a portrait of herself, written in her own lyrics.
