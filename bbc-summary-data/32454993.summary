The fire broke out at a building in the Dinting Lane Industrial Estate in Glossop at about 14:40 BST.
Derbyshire Fire and Rescue said the factory contained cloth and paper.
A spokesman said the response at the scene had been scaled down and a full investigation into the cause would be carried out.
Local people were advised to keep their windows and doors shut "to avoid discomfort".
Tony Kelzo, from Manchester, who had been working at a nearby school, told the BBC he heard a "loud bang late afternoon" and then "saw black smoke".
