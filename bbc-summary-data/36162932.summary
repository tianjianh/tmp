[SN]TITLE[SN]
Expel Livingstone from Labour Party, says Carwyn Jones

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
First Minister Carwyn Jones is calling for Ken Livingstone to be expelled from the Labour Party, for comments made while defending an MP suspended in an anti-Semitism row.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The former mayor of London has now also been suspended pending an inquiry into "bringing the party into disrepute".
Mr Jones said "enough is enough" and called on Labour to take strong action.
The Welsh Labour leader said Mr Livingstone knew his comments would be "harmful" before elections on 5 May.
Labour MP John Mann faces a reprimand for calling Mr Livingstone a "Nazi apologist" outside a BBC studio.
Mr Mann had been referring to comments Mr Livingstone made about Adolf Hitler.
The row was prompted by the suspension of Labour MP Naz Shah over comments she made about Israel on social media.
Mr Livingstone defended her in a BBC Radio London interview on Thursday, saying he had never heard anyone in the Labour Party say anything anti-Semitic.
Then he added: "Let's remember, when Hitler won his election in 1932 his policy then was that Jews should be moved to Israel.
"He was supporting Zionism before he went mad and ended up killing six million Jews."
Mr Mann later confronted Mr Livingstone over these comments as the latter arrived at Westminster's media studios for a BBC Daily Politics interview.
Mr Livingstone told the programme: "He went completely over the top... I have had that with John Mann before."
But Mr Mann stood by his remarks, saying Mr Livingstone was a "Nazi apologist" and should be suspended from the Labour party.
Mr Livingstone said he was not suggesting Hitler was a Zionist, saying the Nazi leader was "a monster from start to finish", but that he had simply been quoting historical "facts".
During a visit to Swansea University, Mr Jones told BBC Wales: "He knew exactly what he was doing he knew how harmful it would be with an election coming next week in different parts of the UK - he has to pay the price [for his comments]."
On 5 May elections are taking place to the Welsh Assembly, Northern Ireland Assembly, Scottish Parliament, London Assembly and local councils in England.
There are also a London mayoral election and polls for police and crime commissioners across England and Wales.
Mr Jones said Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn would be campaigning in Wales "in the next few days".
