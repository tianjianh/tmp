Thousands were protesting in the slum popularly known as Sodom and Gomorrah.
They blockaded roads after soldiers and police used earth-moving equipment to clear part of the slum.
Authorities say the slum blocks drains taking water to the ocean, causing caused floods at the beginning of June where an explosion at a petrol station killed at least 150 people.
The BBC's Sammy Darko at the scene of the protest says police fired tear gas to disperse the protesters but they seemed to be overpowered by protesters who threw stones and damaged police vehicles.
He also heard gun shots but could not confirm if the police were using live ammunition.
Police spokesman Cephas Arthur told the BBC that the situation had been brought under control, but the police would remain on the scene "for as long as it takes us to ensure that the situation doesn't resurrect".
Protest organiser Osman Alhassan said people now don't have anywhere to sleep.
Some 50,000 people live in the slum which is thought to be the biggest and oldest slum in the country.
