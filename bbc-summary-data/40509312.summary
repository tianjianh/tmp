[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A motorist who led police on a cross-border chase at speeds in excess of 156mph has been jailed for nine months.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Paul Robertson, 28, of Bridge of Don, pleaded guilty to driving dangerously on the A74(M) in December.
A court heard he had been driving out of a service area at Gretna when police tried to pull alongside to speak to him and he sped off southwards.
In addition to his jail term his BMW car was confiscated and he was banned from driving for 18 months.
Dumfries Sheriff Court heard how Robertson had been leaving the service area in Dumfries and Galloway at night when police noticed his car with a damaged wing and headlight.
They tried to speak to him but the driver suddenly accelerated and headed south on the motorway.
Fiscal depute Alison Herald said: "The police car gave chase and reached a top speed of 156 mph, but the taillights of the BMW were pulling away in the distance."
As the chase headed over the border onto the M6 in England, the Scottish officers notified Cumbria Police traffic cars and also a helicopter unit.
The fiscal added: "The 28-mile chase continued south before any trace of the car was lost near Penrith."
Robertson was eventually traced the next day at his home near Aberdeen.
His solicitor told the court that his client had been heading from Aberdeen to Liverpool and had panicked when approached by the police.
Speaking after sentencing, Insp Campbell Moffat said: "To drive at such a high speed over such a distance demonstrates a total disregard for both his own safety and the safety of others using the road.
"Speeding or driving at an inappropriate speed is a serious, dangerous and anti-social activity and is a known contributory factor in many collisions which all too often result in serious injury or death.
"The sentence given in this case clearly reflects the seriousness of the case and Police Scotland will continue to operate a robust policy of putting those who exceed the speed limit before the courts."
