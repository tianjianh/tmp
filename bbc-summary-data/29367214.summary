Recent photos of Major Mariam al-Mansouri in her F-16 jet were released as a report circulated that she had led her squadron in Tuesday's raids.
While the UAE is a largely conservative state, it has seen pioneering efforts to allow women to occupy top jobs.
A son of Saudi Crown Prince Salman, Khaled, also joined the air strikes.
Commenting on the involvement of Major Mansouri, a UAE source told AFP news agency that a "coalition Western officer was surprised when she called in to refuel from [an] aerial tanker".
News of her mission electrified sections of social media, with tweeters hailing her as "the woman of the day" and using the hash tag "ladyliberty" to praise her. Angry Islamist sympathisers denounced her "criminal" act.
