Banton, 24, joined the English League Two side last summer and has made 19 appearances for the club.
"This is a good opportunity for Jason to get games under his belt at a very good level," said Crawley head coach Dermot Drummy.
"Opportunities for him have been limited so he has a chance now to make an impression in Scotland."
Banton has been on the books at Liverpool, Leicester City, Crystal Palace and more recently has been at Wycombe Wanderers, Hartlepool United and Notts County.
