[SN]TITLE[SN]
Middlesbrough v Manchester United

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Middlesbrough's caretaker boss Steve Agnew may have Bernardo Espinosa and Rudy Gestede available after injuries.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Adlene Guedioura returns after being cup-tied, but Daniel Ayala, Calum Chambers and George Friend are out.
Paul Pogba misses out for Manchester United because of a hamstring strain, while Daley Blind received a blow to the head against Rostov and is a doubt.
Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Ander Herrera are suspended, but Wayne Rooney, Luke Shaw and Anthony Martial could be fit.
Guy Mowbray: "With Jose Mourinho stressing that United have 'lots of enemies' this week, it might have been nice for him to catch up with a friend.
"Aitor Karanka's dismissal from Middlesbrough means he'll be one down on that score at the Riverside, with Boro's inability TO score one of the reasons for Mourinho's former assistant going.
"His successor faces a conundrum. Changes are usually made to make a relegation-threatened team harder to beat - something not usually associated with becoming more cavalier.
"Looking at their next fixtures though, caretaker Steve Agnew might as well send a team out to have a free hit against fatigued United - whilst taking Mourinho's 'probably lose' comments with a cellar full of salt."

Middlesbrough's caretaker boss Steve Agnew: "I have to be honest, [Thursday] was a really difficult and emotional day.
"Aitor Karanka put in incredible work over the last three and a half years. I really enjoyed his work and his company during my two and a half years working with him.
"But today the players have trained well and we look forward to the weekend."
Manchester United manager Jose Mourinho on his side's fixture congestion: "I don't think it's a funny situation. When I watch marathons and people go to their limit, I don't think it is funny, and I don't think it's funny some of my players in six weeks play 11 matches.
"Play on Monday with 10 men, enjoying five hours the M6 coming back to Manchester. People can ask why was (Phil) Jones playing on the left with so many difficulties. He was playing on the left because he could run and Marcos (Rojo) couldn't run.
"We are living all these things and let's see if Sunday we get a point. That would be great result."
I think we might see Middlesbrough play with a bit more freedom now Aitor Karanka has gone, which was one of the criticisms he faced.
I would not be surprised if Boro get something from Manchester United on Sunday.
