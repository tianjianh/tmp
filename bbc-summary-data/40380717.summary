The 36-year-old Dimension Date cyclist denied Alex Dowsett a record sixth national time-trial title in the Isle of Man by just eight seconds.
A visibly emotional Cummings said: "This victory is for my wife, who never stops supporting and believing."
It was his first race since he crashed at the Tour of the Basque Country.
In the crash in April he fractured his sternum, collarbone and scapula.
He told British Cycling: "I got emotional because I think it means more to my family because they've given me so much support and always been there.
"It's been really tough for my wife - I couldn't move my arms and she did everything for me, so I need to thank you for all she has done."
James Gullen (JLT Condor) finished 50.79 down on Dowsett in third, while Owain Doull abandoned his challenge because of a puncture.
Meanwhile, Claire Rose also won her first national title in the women's race and the Isle of Man's Anna Christian won the under-23 title and finished seventh overall.
Scott Davies continued his dominance of the men's under-23 category by clinching his fourth straight victory.
