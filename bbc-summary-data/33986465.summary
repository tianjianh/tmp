The first yachts have crossed the finish line at the 90th Fastnet race.

Organisers said it had been one of the slowest races in recent years due to light winds.
The challenge, which takes place every two years, runs 608 miles (1,126 km) from Cowes on the Isle of Wight to the Fastnet lighthouse off south-west Ireland, and finishes in Plymouth.
A record 356 yachts left Cowes on Sunday.
Organisers said the only records likely to be broken at the finish line would be for slowness, but added boat speeds had started to pick up as conditions had become more breezy.
A spokeswoman said nine vessels had already finished but an overall winner would not be announced until all the yachts had returned "over the next few days".
The actual finish times of the boats are corrected to account for handicaps, based on weight and speed, meaning the first across the finish line is not necessarily the race winner.
The teams are competing for the Fastnet Challenge Cup.
Two-handed crew Pascal and Alexis Loison won the last race in 2013, when 336 yachts took part.
The French father and son team completed the course in three days, 18 hours, 29 minutes and 57 seconds.
The first race in 1925 started with seven boats, with four making it to the finish line.
