[SN]TITLE[SN]
Labour peer Lord Foulkes proposes second chamber for Scottish Parliament

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A Labour peer has proposed turning the former Royal High School in Edinburgh into a second chamber for the Scottish Parliament.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The plan by Lord Foulkes of Cumnock would see the setting up of a Scottish Senate to revise Holyrood legislation.
It would consist of 46 members elected using proportional representation.
The peer's idea will be examined by members of the House Lords later who are currently examining the details of the Scotland Bill.
The Scottish National Party said the idea was a "non-starter" and there was "no desire" for such a move.
Lord Foulkes believes elections for the second chamber could be held on the same day as elections for the Scottish Parliament.
At present there are controversial plans to turn the vacant school building into a luxury hotel.
The Calton Hill site was a one-time contender for the Scottish Parliament.
However, that plan was vetoed by senior Labour figures and a new building was constructed at Holyrood instead.
