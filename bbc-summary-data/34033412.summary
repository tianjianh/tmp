Neil Faudemer completed the 32km (20-mile) route in 14 hours 57 minutes. It was his fifth attempt.
The 55-year-old from Jersey, who was stung in the mouth by a jellyfish during the attempt, believes he swam around 45km (28 miles) in total.
"I really wanted to do this because of the history - it's haunted me," he said. Ruth Oldham was the first to complete the swim, in 1962.
Mr Faudemer, who became the first man to swim between Sark and Jersey in 2011, left Guernsey at 11:45 BST on Friday and arrived in Jersey just before 03:00 BST on Saturday.
"My wife and her friend were sat in their cars with their headlights on guiding me in," he said.
"It's taken a while to sink in, especially having got so close to finishing the swim before."
Mr Faudemer was joined on the swim by a support team that included Jersey's Minister for Sport, Steve Pallett and fellow sea-swimmer Wendy Trehiou.
