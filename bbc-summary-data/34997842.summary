Engineers are working to restore supplies, with the worst affected areas Conwy county and Corwen, Denbighshire.
Storm Desmond, the fourth named storm of the winter, may lead to cancelled ferry services, poor driving conditions and falling trees, the Met Office said.
A yellow "be aware" warning runs from 17:00 on Friday to 06:00 GMT on Sunday and more rain is forecast for Saturday.
Faults in the electricity supply have also been reported at Bala, Gwynedd, and Trefriw and Llanrwst in Conwy county.
The wind warning is in place for Conwy, Denbighshire, Flintshire, Gwynedd, Powys, Wrexham and Anglesey with most places expected to see gales of up to 55mph (89kph) but coastal and hilly areas will be worst affected.
In Capel Curig, Conwy, a wind gust of 78mph was recorded on Friday evening.
The bad weather follows on from Thursday night when fire crews attended a number of flooding incidents across Wales.
In one incident, a man was rescued from the roof of his car after getting stuck in flood water in Swansea, while flooding had closed the A490 in Welshpool, Powys, in both directions.
Natural Resources Wales has issued one flood warning covering the Lower Dee Valley between Llangollen and Trevalyn Meadows in Rossett, near Wrexham.
The Dee has already burst its banks on the Wales-Cheshire border, with emergency services checking people are safe in affected areas in Holt and Farndon, near Wrexham.
Supt Rob Kirman, from North Wales Police, said that although the river level had peaked, emergency crews would continue to monitor the situation over the weekend as more rain was forecast.
Arriva Trains Wales has warned of disruption over the weekend because of severe weather, with routes most at risk including Llandudno Junction to Blaenau Ffestiniog and Shrewsbury to Machynlleth on the Cambrian Line.
