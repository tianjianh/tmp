The 25-year-old threw new bests in the first, second and third rounds, setting a new mark of 15.97 metres with his third throw.
And there was more Welsh success when archer Jodie Grinham secured silver with John Stubbs in the mixed team compound.
Cardigan-born Grinham and Stubbs were beaten 151-143 by China in the final.
"John and I have competed together in a few competitions but have never done better than bronze, so to do so at the Paralympic Games is amazing," said 23-year-old Grinham.
Welsh athletes have now contributed four medals to Paralympic GB's total in Rio - after Rachel Morris won rowing gold and Sabrina Fortune claimed a bronze in the F20 shot.
Davies won bronze in the shot at the 2012 London Paralympics, where he also won gold in the F42 discus.
Iran's Sajad Mohammadian claimed silver with a throw of 14.31m, while South African Tyrone Pillay picked up bronze.

The International Paralympic Committee dropped the discus event from its programme afterwards, meaning Davies was unable to defend his title in Brazil.
But the 2013 and 2015 F42 discus and F42 shot put world champion added Paralympic shot put gold to his career medal tally with an impressive display in Rio.
Davies' third-round throw of 15.97 was 16 centimetres short of his world record of 16.13m.
The Welshman, who has a combined disability of Talipese and Hemi-hemilia in his right leg, topped his nearest rivals by more than one metre.
"I'm not really happy with the distance because I'm in shape to throw close to 17m and I really did want to knock it out of the park," said Davies.
"It's the Paralympic Games and, at the end of the day, no-one cares what you throw - it's all about who comes first and I'm just happy I can walk away with that gold.
"I'm so happy now, it's hard to put into words."
