Scallop boat skipper admits fatal accident charges

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The master of a Shetland scallop boat that sank in a fatal accident has admitted failing to preserve his fellow crewman's life.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Leonard Scollay, 40, died after the Diamond hit rocks and sank near Burrafirth harbour on 25 March 2014.
At Lerwick Sheriff Court, Christopher Smith, 39, also admitted neglecting to keep a proper lookout.
A Marine Accident Investigation Branch (MAIB) report said both the skipper and Mr Scollay had taken drugs.
It said their ability to function had been significantly impaired as a result.
It was Mr Scollay's first voyage to sea and he had not had any sea survival training. He was not wearing a life jacket.
It was dark and stormy when the accident happened but procurator fiscal Gary Aitken told the court that the navigation lights leading into the harbour could have been easily followed.
The MAIB report released last year said: "The skipper employed Leonard without ensuring that he was appropriately trained.
"It is likely that Leonard Scollay would have survived had he been wearing a lifejacket.
"However, he had taken heroin before the accident and this would have impaired his ability to survive or to appreciate his predicament."
Smith will return to court for sentencing next month.
