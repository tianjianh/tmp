2018 Winter Olympics: GB men secure curling place

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Great Britain's men have a place in the curling event at the 2018 Winter Olympics after Scotland finished in the top eight at the World Championships.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Scotland rink, who compete as Great Britain at the Olympics, won six and lost five in Edmonton, Canada.
That meant skip David Murdoch's team missed out on the medal matches.
Britain's men, 2014 silver medallists, join Eve Muirhead's women's team, who won a place in Pyeongchang Games with World Championship bronze in March.
Scotland had to win their last three games in Edmonton to salvage Olympic qualification for Team GB. Following a 6-2 victory over Italy on Wednesday and Germany (7-1) early on Thursday, Murdoch's rink achieved the Olympic berth with a dramatic late-night extra-end 7-6 victory over Russia.
With results from the 2016 and 2017 World Championships taken into consideration, Britain secured a place at the 2018 Games by just one qualification point.
GB could also qualify in mixed curling, which will make its Olympic debut in South Korea.
