Nasa releases breathtaking images of stars and galaxies

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Nasa has released a series of breathtaking images of stars and galaxies millions of light years away from Earth.

It's to mark the International Year of Light, which the space agency hopes will "help spread the word about the wonders of light."
The snaps are all taken by the Chandra X-ray Observatory, a special space telescope worth Â£1.1bn.
It explores the Universe in X-rays from high-energy regions.
After a massive star exploded in a satellite galaxy to the Milky Way, it left behind this beauty - an expanding shell of debris called SNR 0519-69.0.
The blue bits are a multimillion degree gas seen in X-rays. The red is the outer edge of the explosion.
This object, known as MSH 11-62. It was formed after a massive star exploded (you'll start to see a reoccurring theme here).
Its centre is made up of highly charged particles, which spin its core.
This supernova remnant is about 16,000 light years from Earth.
This is a galaxy some 700 million light years away, but that makes it the closest powerful radio galaxy to Earth.
Its giant bubble is filled with hot, X-ray omitting gas. The red bits are "hot spots" about 300,000 light years out from the centre of the galaxy.
Guess what? These are the remains an exploded star.
This is the oldest documented example of a supernova and may even have been witnessed by Chinese astronomers almost 2,000 years ago.
RCW 86 is approximately 8,000 light-years away and about 85 light-years in diameter.
This galaxy is nicknamed the "Whirlpool".
It's one of the most famous galaxies in the sky, appearing face-on when viewed from Earth.
It's a spiral galaxy which like our Milky Way is about 30 million light years away.
It's best seen from the Northern Hemisphere during the months of March, April or May.
