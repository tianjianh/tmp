Borders broadband gains and goals outlined

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A report has found good progress is being made in delivering superfast broadband to southern Scotland but "a range of challenging issues" remain.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Digital connectivity is seen as "critical to the economic development and competitiveness" of the area.
Scottish Borders Council has heard how dozens of new superfast broadband cabinets have been installed.
However, it is being advised to raise concerns with the Scottish government about issues affecting rural areas.
The report to the local authority's executive committee detailed the impact of the Digital Scotland Superfast Broadband (DSSB) programme in the region.

70 New superfast broadband cabinets
94% Premises reached
It highlights strong progress but also issues which present a "significant impediment" to allowing access to better services in an "equitable way".
It said DSSB was likely to leave about 6% of premises - mainly in more remote areas - with slow broadband or no service at all.
The report added Community Broadband Scotland (CBS) was now getting involved in areas outside the superfast roll-out.
It is working with more isolated villages to co-ordinate efforts to provide a "critical mass" of premises to allow services to be installed.
The South of Scotland Alliance is also looking at extending the reach of the programme.
Other possible solutions could come from satellite broadband or a new major information technology contract recently agreed by the council.
