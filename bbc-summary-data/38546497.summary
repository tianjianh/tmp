Interior ministry spokesman Saad Maan was quoted as saying a security guard fired on a suspicious vehicle and the driver then blew it up.
It is not yet clear who was behind the blast, but so-called Islamic State (IS) has claimed recent attacks targeting Shia Muslims in the city.
IS is under pressure from an Iraqi government offensive in the north.
Iraqi special forces and their Shia militia allies have been trying to drive IS from its stronghold in the northern city of Mosul. They entered eastern districts in November but IS have since slowed their advance towards the centre.
The Baghdad explosion happened at the main vegetable market, Jumila, in the primarily Shia Sadr City district.
A similar attack took place on 2 January. A suicide car bomb hit a busy square in Sadr City, killing 35 people.
