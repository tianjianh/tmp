County Championship: Yorkshire pile up runs against Warwickshire at Edgbaston

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Gary Ballance took his score to 68 and fellow England player Adil Rashid made 63 as four Yorkshire players passed fifty on a second weather-hit day against Warwickshire at Edgbaston.

Steve Patterson made a career-best 62 to add to Jack Leaning's 51 as the reigning county champions ended another truncated day on 368-9.
Chris Woakes (3-79) and Keith Barker (3-99) were the Bears' best bowlers.
Bears wicketkeeper Tim Ambrose, this year's beneficiary, held four catches.
His miss of Liam Plunkett off Barker first ball, before the England man went on to make 26 out of a 43-run seventh-wicket stand with Rashid, may yet prove costly on a day ended early by bad light.
Warwickshire may feel they have missed a chance having had Yorkshire 85-4 and then 209-6, but the visitors had already begun their recovery by reaching the close on 177-4 on day one, even before overnight and morning rain meant no play before lunch on day two.
Although Woakes quickly found Leaning's edge when they resumed to end a partnership of 102 in 32 overs with Ballance, the Tykes showed their battling qualities.
Given the weather forecast for days three and four, after the loss of almost an entire day's play spread over the first two days, a draw already looks the most likely result.
First on the agenda on day three, with 33 balls left before the 110-over cut-off mark, is whether Yorkshire's last pair of Patterson and Ryan Sidebottom can add the 32 runs needed to claim a fifth batting bonus point.
Warwickshire director of cricket Dougie Brown:
"It's been pretty miserable cricket conditions. We probably bowled better than we did on the first day, but credit to Yorkshire, they got stuck in and have fought hard.
"It was frustrating but we knew that's what they would try to do. They are a very good side for a reason.
"They bat all the way down and have got 11 dangerous batters really. That's what they do. You just hope that you have your day and produce one or two deliveries that knock them over quite quickly."
Yorkshire and England all-rounder Adil Rashid:
"We played exceptionally well there and the lower and middle orders chipped in with crucial runs.
"It wasn't easy, especially with the bad weather around and us going on and off the pitch, but we dug in deep.
"This is a ground we have enjoyed some success at. In the last few seasons we have done exceptionally well here but you can't just look back at the past. Hopefully the wicket will do enough for us to create chances."
