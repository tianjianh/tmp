[SN]TITLE[SN]
Sevilla 2-1 Alavés

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Wissam Ben Yedder's late strike gave Sevilla a 2-1 win over Alaves in a chaotic La Liga game that saw four players and the referee go off injured.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The French striker opened the scoring on 74 minutes after both sides had lost two players to injuries.
Alaves equalised through Victor Laguardia shortly after referee Mateu Lahoz limped off with a calf problem.
However, Ben Yedder backheeled Vitolo's cross past the keeper in the 89th minute to move Sevilla up to second.
Alaves midfielders Kiko Femenia and Daniel Torres were both forced off the pitch inside the first half hour.
Samir Nasri - on loan from Manchester City - and Luciano Vietto were then replaced for Sevilla shortly after the break, before substitute Ganso set up Ben Yedder's first goal.
The fourth official replaced Lahoz for the final stages of the game as Laguardia tapped in a corner to level the scores.
Ben Yedder, who scored the deciding goal in Sevilla's Champions League clash with Lyon on Tuesday, again proved the difference with a crisp finish.
Match ends, Sevilla 2, Alavés 1.
