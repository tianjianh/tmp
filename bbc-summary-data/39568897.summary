Super League: Huddersfield Giants 22-29 Catalans Dragons

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Catalans Dragons twice came from behind to beat Huddersfield Giants and record back-to-back Super League away wins.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Aaron Murphy and Jake Mamo twice put the Giants ahead but Tony Gigot's try and Brayden Wiliame's converted score gave Dragons a 12-10 lead at the break.
Richie Myler, Vincent Duport and Luke Walsh then all crossed to put the visitors in control.
Jermaine McGillvary cut the Giants' arrears but Gigot's drop-goal sealed it before Sam Wood's late consolation try.
Huddersfield have now gone seven games without a win, despite battling draws at both Wigan and St Helens during that run, and remain third from bottom.
But Catalans, who won at Leigh last Friday, climb to seventh, level on points with reigning champions Wigan, who host Saints on Friday.
After an evenly matched first half, Huddersfield were made to pay for Danny Brough being sent to the sin-bin for disputing Myler's score soon after the break.
Duport finished in the corner as Catalans made their numerical advantage count, but once Brough returned to the field, Walsh immediately intercepted his pass to race in.
McGillvary's score briefly gave Huddersfield hope but Gigot's drop-goal with four minutes left put the result beyond doubt, meaning Wood's score off the last play of the game was little more than a consolation.
Huddersfield head coach Rick Stone told BBC Radio 5 live sports extra: "It was a game that was there for the taking for us.
"In the first half we controlled the game but in the first 20 minutes of the second half it was a self-destruct situation.
"Players have key decisions go against them but there is a time when you have to accept the referee's decision and Danny Brough didn't manage that well.
"We could have easily won the game tonight but we made 18 errors and to give yourselves a chance you can't make 18 errors and expect to win the game."
Catalans stand-off Luke Walsh told BBC Radio 5 live sports extra: "After the Wakefield game (Catalans lost 38-18 at home) we knew we had two important games coming up and games we had to win.
"We have a lot of improvement to do but we're getting better and getting our confidence back, which is good."
Catalans dummy-half Richie Myler told BBC Radio 5 live sports extra: "We pinpointed the Easter games to turn our season around.
"We are without a lot of players and we're doing it tough but we are happy with two wins away from home.
"We have not been playing well at the start of the season but we are improving week by week.
"These wins have given us some breathing space from the bottom of the table but now we need to kick on and aim as high as we can."
