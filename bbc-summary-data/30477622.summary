African Dream: Malawian business tycoon Mike Mlombwa on red tape

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Mike Mlombwa is a Malawian business tycoon who, as a teenager, walked about 50km (30 miles) from his village near the southern border town of Mwanza to the commercial capital, Blantyre, because he could not afford a bus fare.

He managed to raise the money to buy two second-hand cars and today owns a car rental company, with a fleet of more than 70 vehicles.
As part of the latest series of African Dream, Mr Mlombwa shares his tips on dealing with red tape, which he describes as one of the major obstacles to doing business in Malawi:
Did you know?
The term "red tape" dates back to the 16th Century when Henry VIII of England besieged the Pope with around 80 petitions regarding the annulment of his marriage to Catherine of Aragon - each one bound and sealed with the obligatory red cloth tape.
Even today, most UK legal documents are bound with pink or red tape.
In the US, the phrase originated from the practice of binding Civil War veteran records in red twill tape.
