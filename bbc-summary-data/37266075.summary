The presenter succeeded Jonathan Ross as host of the revamped weekly show and said leaving "wasn't an easy decision".
Winkleman, who also co-hosts Saturday night show Strictly Come Dancing, said the show "simply deserves someone who can give it their all".
A new series will return this autumn with the new presenter to be announced "in due course", the BBC said.
Winkleman, who lists The Godfather and The Shawshank Redemption as her favourite films, said: "I'm incredibly sad about leaving the film show and it wasn't an easy decision.
"At this time of year I juggle all kinds of things for TV and radio and the show simply deserves someone who can give it their all."
She added that she would miss film critic Danny Leigh, who presents the show alongside her, and the team behind the show.
Mark Bell, BBC head of arts commissioning, said: "We've loved having Claudia on Film 2016 and I'd like to thank her for all her hard work and commitment to the show."
The long-running film show, first broadcast 45 years ago, was fronted by film critic Barry Norman for 26 years. He was succeeded by Ross in 1999, who stayed at the helm for 11 years.
Winkleman will still present the BBC's The Great British Sewing Bee and host a Radio 2 show.
After landing the job on Strictly in 2014 when Sir Bruce Forsyth left, the mother-of-three said of her TV and radio commitments, she would "make it work".
The 14th series of Strictly gets under way on Saturday evening, with Olympians, actors and singers competing for the glitterball trophy.
