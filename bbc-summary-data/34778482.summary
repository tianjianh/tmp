The incident happened at about 17:00 on Monday at the Fernieside Newsagents in Fernieside Crescent.
The men stole a four-figure sum of cash and a large quantity of cigarettes.
A 41-year-old worker was treated at the scene. The first suspect is white, about 19 years old, 5ft 8ins tall and of stocky/heavy build.
He was wearing a dark hooded top, dark grey joggers, maroon skate shoes with a white trim and a dark tartan scarf covering his face.
The second is white, about 19-years-old, 5ft 10ins tall and of slim build. He was wearing dark clothing, and also had his face obscured by a dark garment.
The third suspect is white and was wearing dark clothing with white trainers.
Det Con Jonny Wright, of Police Scotland, said: "Not only was this an extremely frightening ordeal for the shopkeeper, he was also assaulted and robbed of a considerable amount of stock and cash.
"We are pursuing various lines of inquiry to identify these men but would ask anyone who recognises their description to contact police immediately.
"In addition, anyone who remembers seeing anything suspicious around the store on Monday evening, or who has any other information relevant to this investigation should also get in touch."
