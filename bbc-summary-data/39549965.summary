[SN]TITLE[SN]
Fleetwood Town 1-0 Millwall

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Fleetwood cut the gap on second-placed Bolton to just one point with a hard-fought win over promotion rivals Millwall.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Ben Davies' header gave Uwe Rosler's men all three points at Highbury, which kept Fleetwood's automatic promotion hopes alive.
Millwall dominated the opening 25 minutes and played Fleetwood off the park, but ended up paying the price for missed opportunities.
Neil Harris' men carved out seven chances in that blistering spell, with Lee Gregory wasting the two biggest opportunities.
Ben Thompson's effort from outside the box cannoned back off the post into the forward's path, but he fired straight at Fleetwood goalkeeper Alex Cairns when one-on-one.
Jed Wallace steamed down the left flank before teeing Gregory up in space in the box, but the striker's first-time effort crashed into a post.
And the Lions paid for their lack of bite as Fleetwood survived the storm and opened the scoring in first-half injury time.
Amari'i Bell was needlessly fouled on the left flank by Mahlon Romeo and, when George Glendon whipped the subsequent set-piece into the box, Davies nodded in his first goal for the club.
It was an end-to-end second half, with Gregory having an effort blocked on the line by Davies and Cairns making an unbelievable save to stop Jake Cooper's header.
Millwall threw everything at Fleetwood in the dying stages, but some excellent defending from the hosts and a last-gasp Cairns save from Calum Butcher's header denied the Lions.
