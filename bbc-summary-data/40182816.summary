South Australian nurse Kirsty Boden, 28, was confirmed to have died on Tuesday.
The other victim has not been named.
"The Australian government is deeply saddened to confirm that two Australians have been killed in the London terrorist attack," Foreign Minister Julie Bishop said in a statement on Wednesday.
"The Australian government has remained in close contact with the families who have requested privacy."
Ms Boden was from a town called Loxton, about 250km (155 miles) from Adelaide, and had been working in the UK as a senior staff nurse in Theatres Recovery.
Her family said she died after running towards the danger to help victims on the bridge.
"Kirsty was loved and adored by her family, friends and boyfriend," their statement said. "She was the most outgoing, kind and generous person who loved to help people.
"We are so proud of Kirsty's brave actions which demonstrate how selfless, caring and heroic she was, not only on that night, but throughout all of her life. Kirsty - we love you and we will miss you dearly."
South Australian Premier Jay Weatherill said Ms Boden's death was heartbreaking.
"We all know someone who could have been innocently wandering through London last weekend," he said.
"It is the random nature of this heinous crime which makes it so hard to fathom."
Two more Australians, Candice Hedge from Brisbane and Andrew Morrison from Darwin, were among the injured, after both being stabbed.
