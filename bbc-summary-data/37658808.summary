[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Plans to transform part of Pembrokeshire's county town of Haverfordwest have been unveiled to the public.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Fairacre proposes the part demolition and reconfiguration of the existing Wilko store to provide a multi-screen cinema and four restaurants along the River Cleddau.
The company says it will address a lack of leisure provision.
The plans went on show at Riverside Shopping on Monday.
Haverfordwest is already home to the Palace Cinema and an application was made by Conygar earlier this year for a multi-screen cinema and restaurant complex at Slade Lane.
Jeannie Pritchard from Fairacre said: "There is currently a lack of leisure provision within Haverfordwest and this new development will create a vibrant evening attraction for residents and those who visit this historical centre."
The pre-application consultation runs until 4 November.
