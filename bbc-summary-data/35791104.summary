The on-loan Cardiff striker headed in Greg Cunningham's cross in the second minute of added time at Deepdale.
QPR had taken a fifth-minute lead as Sebastian Polter headed in Alejandro Faurlin's cross from close range for his seventh goal of the season.
Preston are 10th in the Championship, nine points from the play-off places with QPR two points behind them.
The hosts dominated after going behind to Polter's early goal, with Jordan Hugill and Daniel Johnson both going close for Simon Grayson's side before Adam Reach squandered one of their best opportunities when he scuffed a volley well wide.
Rangers' top scorer Tjaronn Chery had two opportunities to double the lead in the 83rd minute, curling a 30-yard free kick just wide before going clean through on goal only to be denied by keeper Anders Lindegaard.
Preston continued to be profligate in front of goal before Doyle's late equaliser, and the Irish striker had an opportunity to win it for North End a minute later but his header was straight at Alex Smithies.
Preston manager Simon Grayson: "We've got good character and good spirit about us and I thought it was the least we deserved.
"We played well, passed it well, but just lacked that little bit of quality in the right areas. We kept on asking questions and got a justifiable equaliser.
"We've got some really good results so that breeds confidence. It's another positive result for us. The players have given everything they've got and showed the spirit required to get something out of games."

QPR boss Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink: "We should have got the three points. In the first half they put pressure on us but we soaked it up.
"We passed the ball well and I didn't see them scoring. You have to take chances to make it 2-0 but it wasn't meant to be.
"We take a lot from this performance today. We have to take the result on the chin, decisions went against us, we didn't take some chances but the performance was good."
