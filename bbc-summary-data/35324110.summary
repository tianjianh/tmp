Lucas has had two previous spells with the National League side this season, scoring three goals in 10 appearances.
The 20-year-old made his Bristol Rovers debut in April 2014, but has yet to start a game for the League Two club.
"He has proved already that he is a handful for defences at this level and he gets goals," Wood manager Luke Garrard told the club website.
"He comes into a squad that is growing in confidence and will give me options in the forward areas."
