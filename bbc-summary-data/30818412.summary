Alan Henning murder: Regulator takes over charity amid fears over extremist links

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The aid group with which Alan Henning was travelling when he was kidnapped in Syria has been taken over by the charity regulator amid allegations of possible links to extremists.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Charity Commission is investigating Al-Fatiha Global over "serious concerns about its governance and financial management".
The charity aims to provide humanitarian aid to conflict zones.
Salford taxi driver Mr Henning was murdered by Islamic State in October.
The 47-year-old volunteer aid worker had been held hostage for almost a year after he was kidnapped within minutes of arriving in the country, in December 2013.
The Charity Commission has appointed lawyer Michael King to oversee Al-Fatiha Global as an interim manager while its inquiry - which began in March 2014 - continues.
He will oversee the group's activities while the commission investigates allegations of "inappropriate links between the charity and individuals purportedly involved in supporting armed or other inappropriate activities in Syria".
A statement from Al-Fatiha Global said: "Michael King has been appointed alongside the present trustees to ensure proper control of the charity's funds and to put in place more appropriate governance for the charity following its recent growth in fundraising and activities.
"He also has the responsibility to ensure that the charity's operational risks in Turkey and Syria, including risks to volunteers, are assessed and that necessary food and medical supplies are effectively and safely delivered."
Following his death, a video of Mr Henning's beheading was released by IS, who had previously killed two US journalists and another British aid worker David Haines.
