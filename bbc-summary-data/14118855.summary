Algeria profile

The government exercises broad control over the media. Until 2014, a state monopoly forced private satellite TVs to operate from outside Algeria.

Four private channels are now authorised: Dzair TV, El Djazairia TV, Ennahar TV and Echourouk TV. No opposition-leaning TV stations broadcast from Algerian soil.
State TV and radio report favourably on the president and the government, avoiding criticism or dissenting views.
There is a lively private press. However, the withdrawal of advertising, under government pressure, at titles critical of the government has "played a role in the muzzling of free media", says Reporters Without Borders.
Arabic-language newspapers attract a larger readership, while French-language titles are preferred among the educated elite.
There were nearly 8 million internet users by 2016 (InternetLiveStats.com).
A cyber-crime law gives the authorities the right to block websites deemed "contrary to public order or decency".
Facebook use is on the rise. The most popular accounts are run by politicians, government officials, writers and footballers.
