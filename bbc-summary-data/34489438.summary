Enfield Mini Holland plan: Cycling revolution hits the suburbs

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
London Mayor Boris Johnson has big plans to increase the numbers of journeys done by bike.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
But to do that he needs to encourage more people in the suburbs to take to two wheels.
At the moment, for an example, in Enfield only 0.5% of journeys are done by bike and the ambition is to increase this to 5%.
There is much more emphasis on using cars to get around.
What the mayor and his transport commissioner are doing is focusing money on "three mini Hollands" - three boroughs where Transport for London (TfL) fund council improvements to cycling.
Previously TfL spending in outer London on cycling was £3m, but it will now rise to £100m. Of that there will be £30m each for Kingston, Enfield and Waltham Forest.
But there is opposition.
Take Enfield in north London.
In Enfield Town they want to close Church Street to all traffic apart from buses and bikes.
They also want to create a network of segregated cycle lanes and a much nicer environment for pedestrians.
The argument is it will regenerate the town centre.
TfL and Enfield say these improvements will benefit business and they claim there is evidence funding cycling infrastructure increases turnover.
Some traders though remain completely unconvinced and believe their businesses are intrinsically linked to cars.
They do not want to change the status quo although they are adamant they are not anti-cycling.
Those who live on nearby roads also have concerns the traffic which currently uses the high street will be diverted onto their residential roads.
Enfield Council says it is listening and will change its plans after a consultation.
The reality is City Hall says it could withdraw the £30m if the plans are not up to scratch.
There are various consultations now going on.
If changes are to succeed there is certainly a battle for the hearts and minds of some in Enfield and the suburbs who have no connection at all with cycling and Mr Johnson's cycling revolution - and frankly at the moment don't want it.
