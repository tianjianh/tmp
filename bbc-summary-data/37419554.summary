Yeovil chairman John Fry said they may not be able to fund the Ladies if plans to re-develop Huish Park are rejected.
Sherwood sought to reassure fans of the Ladies team's financial independence.
"Sometimes as a little sister, a big brother can say something he didn't mean - this is what a family is like but be rest assured, our destiny is in our own hands," he told BBC Sport.
"Nothing is begged or borrowed from the men's programme. We control our own destiny. No-one else controls it.
"We are an independent club - we have our financial structures, we have our own board. We have our own coaching staff.
"We are very proud to be part of Yeovil Town Football club because it is a massive football club in the south west.
"But I can assure every single one of our fans that our destiny is in our own hands and that's the way it will stay."
Sherwood's side are top of Women's Super League Two with three matches remaining and host promotion-rivals Everton on Sunday.
