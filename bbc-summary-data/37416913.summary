The move is the latest step in the company's attempts to expand globally.
Pinewood currently has studios in Canada, the Dominican Republic, Malaysia and the US.
The UK studio company has produced international blockbusters such as Star Wars movies and the James Bond franchise.
"Pinewood has been working in China for a number of years and we have forged some strong relationships with film companies, content producers and games developers," said Andrew Smith, president of Pinewood China.
"A permanent presence in China is a key strategic element of Pinewood's overall international strategy."
Pinewood currently already provides consultancy services to a number of Chinese film companies, including advising Wanda Group, the Chinese entertainment and property conglomerate.
Earlier this year, Pinewood's owners agreed to sell the company to a property investment fund for Â£323.3m ($421.9m).
