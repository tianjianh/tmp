Cardiff surgeon Peter O'Keefe appeals gross misconduct sacking

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A Cardiff heart surgeon who was dismissed for gross misconduct has launched an appeal against his sacking.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Consultant Peter O'Keefe, 49, was suspended from University Hospital of Wales in 2012.
In August, an independent inquiry panel dismissed Mr O'Keefe, after finding his "standards of behaviour in the workplace constituted gross misconduct".
He was entitled to appeal under official procedures.
