A large, underground tank built in World War Two to provide water should Lincoln Cathedral be hit by an air raid is to be excavated.

The now redundant tank, buried on the north side of the cathedral is to be removed in a community dig in 2017.
Now pictures have surfaced of its construction and use by firefighters during the war.
The work is part of a Â£16m project to renovate the cathedral and its grounds.
Live updates on this story and others from Lincolnshire
Susan Taylor has found the photographs, some showing her grandfather Frank Brown who was a member of Lincoln Fire Brigade during the war.
The photos show the brigade helping to build the tank and "capture a team working together to help protect our precious cathedral", she said.
A new visitor centre with exhibition space to display some of the cathedral's treasures is planned where the water tank sits.
Cathedral architect and surveyor Nicholas Rank said the dig would reveal historical information from World War Two and from buildings on the site before the water tank was installed.
It would be a chance to see "first-hand the work done to protect the cathedral from threatening air strikes".
Landscaping of Dean's Green is to create a new outdoor space and the West Front is also to be restored under the plans.
The first cathedral on the site built by Bishop Remigius was consecrated in 1092 and building continued throughout the medieval period.
