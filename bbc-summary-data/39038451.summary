Locations on Skye as well as in and around Shieldaig, Kishorn and Applecross in Wester Ross were used for the Guy Ritchie-directed movie.
Due for release in May, it stars former Byker Grove and Sons of Anarchy actor Chris Hunnam in the lead role.
Katie McGrath, Hermione Corfield, Jude Law and Eric Bana also star.
The landscape of the Isle of Skye will also be seen this summer in Transformers: The Last Knight.
VisitScotland has welcomed the expected exposure of Scotland to global cinema audiences.
Chief executive Malcolm Roughead said: "Skye has provided stunning backdrops to a host of high-profile movies in recent years, including The BFG, Macbeth and Prometheus.
"Guy Ritchie's King Arthur: Legend of the Sword is another opportunity to promote Scotland, not only as a wonderful set-jetting destination, but to highlight this country's connection to the man behind the myth."
He added: "It is particularly fitting in our Year of History, Heritage and Archaeology. From World Heritage Sites to ancient monuments, cultural traditions to our myths, stories and legends - the year-long programme will spotlight some of our greatest assets and icons as well as our hidden gems."
