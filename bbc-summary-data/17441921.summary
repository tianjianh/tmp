The LP has now sold more than 4,142,000 copies, making it the seventh biggest-selling album of all-time.
Figures from the Official Charts Company show it is now 12,000 copies away from the sixth best-selling album, Dire Straits' Brothers In Arms.
"As every week goes by, another record seems to tumble in front of Adele," said spokesman Martin Talbot.
"Now, her 21 album has overtaken The Dark Side Of The Moon in the all-time biggest sellers list - and by the end of the week, it may well have overtaken Brothers In Arms, too.
"Then she will have Michael Jackson's Thriller in her sights.
"It has been an extraordinary 12 months or so for Adele, and it looks set to become even more extraordinary as the days and weeks go by."

1 - Greatest Hits - Queen - 5,864,000 copies sold.
2 - Sgt Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band - The Beatles - 5,045,000
