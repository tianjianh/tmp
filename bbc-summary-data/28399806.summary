Kieron Williamson, from Norfolk, saw his watercolours, oils and pastels sell at Picturecraft Gallery in Holt on Friday in just a matter of minutes.
The child prodigy, who is worth about £2m after selling pieces at auction since the age of seven, was exhibiting his latest work alongside pieces by his East Anglian hero Edward Seago.
His mother Michelle Williamson said she was "amazed" at the demand.
"You never know how each year is going to go," she said.
"Keith [her husband] and I are always a little pessimistic, but it's really lovely that people still want his work."
Twenty-nine of the landscapes sold for £265,000 through a pre-exhibition sale on Thursday, with the remaining 11 pieces fetching £125,000 on Friday.
People in New York, Thailand and Germany were among the buyers.
The most expensive lots, including the piece Sailor Boy, sold for £22,675 each.
Gallery owner Adrian Hill said: "It's stunning in this day and age that someone can sell their work at this speed, let alone when they're Kieron's age."
Kieron's next exhibition will be held next year.
