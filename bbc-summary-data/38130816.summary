Notts County: First team avoids reserve game after match called off

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Notts County were unable to go through with their plan to play "all first-team players" in a reserve fixture against Chesterfield after the game was called off because of a frozen pitch.

The Magpies, relegated in 2015, have lost their past four League Two games to slip to 19th in the table.
The club did not comment on whether the team selection plan was related to their recent run of results.
Chesterfield had planned to field a mixture of reserve and youth players.
Following Saturday's 3-2 defeat by Barnet, County assistant manager Mark Crossley told BBC Radio Nottingham that "the performances of late have not been good enough".
He added: "The players have got to show us what they're made of. At the moment they're showing us they're not made of anything."
Last month, manager John Sheridan claimed his team would not have beaten a pub side after a 4-0 loss to Blackpool.
