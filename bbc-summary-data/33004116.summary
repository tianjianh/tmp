A police chief taking early retirement believes the number of forces in England should be cut significantly.

Bedfordshire chief constable Colette Paul said collaboration brought budget savings but force mergers could happen.
The number of forces could reduce if local links could be maintained and forces collaborated on providing expensive specialist units, she said.
Ms Paul said she had decided to step down for family reasons after two years heading the county's police force.
Her family had supported her during her career and she was now going to give them more time, she said.
She told the BBC Bedfordshire Police did not have enough resources and she had supported Police and Crime Commissioner Olly Martins' decision to hold a referendum asking for a budget increase.
This was refused in the vote and Ms Paul said she accepted that and the force now had to bear its share of government cuts.
"Bedfordshire crime levels are more like a London borough and that means we are underfunded," she said.
"My personal view is that there should be a significantly smaller number of police forces and I would always support more collaboration."
Ms Paul said she was proud her force had taken the regional lead on the fight against terrorism, which she saw as a significant risk in Bedfordshire, and it had brought a great deal of collaboration with neighbouring constabularies.
"This helped us to get the right intelligence and to use it to cut the risk," she said.
The force had been criticised over being remote and Ms Paul recruited more officers and based them in local communities "to build confidence" and hold the frontline, she said.
"This local presence is very important. Even forces closer than others to merger retain this important local element."
