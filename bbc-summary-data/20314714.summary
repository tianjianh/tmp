Police said it was taken from Londis on St John's Road, Waterloo, at about 07:30 GMT on Monday.
It was reported to officers on Tuesday after the shopkeeper noticed was missing. CCTV is being examined from the store and nearby area.
The offender is described as aged 25-30 and slim with dark hair. He was wearing glasses, jeans and a black jacket.
Supt Kevin Johnson from Merseyside Police said: "I'm sure members of this community would agree that this was a despicable act and we are working hard to trace the person responsible.
"I would urge anyone who was in the area at the time or who recognises the description of this offender to make contact with my officers, so he can be brought to justice."
