Gerald Jacob's family said he had retired last December and had been planning to "continue his life travelling" with partner.
The incident at Loggerheads is believed to have happened on Saturday at 19:30 GMT. Police were alerted to the crash scene on Sunday just before midday.
"Gerry, as we all knew him, loved life and lived it to the full," they said.
North Wales Police are appealing for witnesses to the incident on Ruthin Road involving a grey BMW car which was found in a hedge.
