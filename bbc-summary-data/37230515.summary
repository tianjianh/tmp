Wedding dresses: What happens next?

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
What did you do with your wedding dress after the big day?

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Did you pack it away safely in storage, or decide to sell it? Have you ever worn it again?
Relationship expert Samantha Burns couldn't bear to see the back of her gown and says she wears it every year to mark her anniversary.
"I had looked forward to the day for so long and couldn't believe in a matter of hours it was over," Samantha said. "It was in that moment that I turned to my husband and told him that I intended to wear my wedding dress for every anniversary as long as I could fit in it.
"I envisioned myself doing the activities we enjoy as a couple, frolicking around restaurants, parks, and ice cream shops in my white gown."
Here is a selection of stories about what your dress did next.
I got married in August 1980, and have worn my wedding dress every Christmas Day since.
It's a white, full-length, jersey dress with a built-in train.
Not only does it still fit me - I now weigh less than I did when I got married - but I can also fit into my husband's wedding suit, which he can't.
I also have my late mother's wedding dress from 1949.  That is a bit big for me now, but I have worn that as well.
My husband and I have just celebrated our 36th wedding anniversary.
We were married in St Mary & Ethelburga's Church in Barking, Essex
I wore my wedding dress on the first Christmas after we were married, as it was such a lovely dress, and you don't often get the chance to dress up.
Everyone in the family thought it was a nice idea, and it's become a family tradition.  I even cook the dinner wearing it, with an apron over it."
It was the most expensive dress I ever bought.
I wouldn't let my dad pay for it, as I wanted to do it myself.
I've had very good value from it. It's probably worked out to be the least expensive item I own, in terms of cost per wear.
I was married in 1994 but separated in 2005 and then eventually divorced amicably.
My dress stayed in a box and moved house with me a couple of times.
I've got two boys, so there was no daughter who might have been interested, and I never got round to selling it.
I saw a post on Facebook about Cherished Gowns UK, which makes gowns out of wedding dresses for babies who have died.
I thought that donating my dress to them was something I'd like to do.
There is a long waiting list, but eventually I sent my dress to them in April this year.
They say to allow six months for the baby gowns to be made, so I don't think "mine" are ready yet.
I got married on the 30 August 2008, we recently celebrated our eighth wedding anniversary.
I am quite small at 5ft 2in so although I'd always imagined a huge dress, when I tried some of them on they didn't suit me at all.
I looked more like an 80s inspired toilet roll holder than a blushing bride.
The bridal shop I used suggested that I try something more tight-fitting. I'd never considered a tight dress and as someone who wanted a traditional wedding, I needed some convincing.
When I tried it on however I loved it. I liked how it seems to float and how light it was.
When it came to what I would do with the dress after the big day I hadn't really thought about it. I didn't want to throw it away and although trashing dresses was becoming a trend, I just didn't want to.
I was coming up to 30-years-old and so went back to Gill at the bridal shop and asked what she thought.
I had a long train on my dress so she made me a beautiful knee length gown with a matching bolero.
Needless to say, with a big hat and some heels to match, I had a fabulous day at the races and felt a million dollars in my "second hand" dress.
I got married in 1974, and again in 1983.
My first wedding dress from Nicholas Bros Seven Sisters Road was a traditional long gown which I kept until about 1988, when I threw it away in the rubbish.
My second dress was a shorter one from Pronuptia Enfield Town - this was also worn by my sister and sister-in-law.
My sister got married in a bit of a rush and on a low budget so we did all the catering and she wore my dress.
My sister-in-law was in a similar position, and again I catered her wedding and she borrowed my dress.
I still have it.
