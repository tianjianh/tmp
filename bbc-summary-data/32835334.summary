More than 200 people died when three trains crashed at Quintinshill in Dumfries and Galloway on 22 May 1915.
One of the trains was a World War One troop transport carrying hundreds of Scottish soldiers who were bound for Gallipoli.
The Princess Royal and First Minister Nicola Sturgeon were among those attending the service.
The scale of the Quintinshill disaster was horrific, the result of two train crashes.
It started at 06:50, when a troop train packed with 500 soldiers of the Royal Scots crashed into a passenger service which was stationary on the main line near the border between Scotland and England.
Just over a minute later, an express train travelling north crashed into the wreckage of the first crash.
Gas from the lighting system of the troop train's old wooden carriages caught fire and it took 23 hours to extinguish.
More than 200 soldiers were killed, as well as 12 civilians, although some remains were never identified and the exact death toll is uncertain.
In addition to the deaths, there were 246 people injured.
The two signalmen controlling the line were both sent to prison.
Gretna Green was the focal point of services on Friday to remember those who died.
Dumfries and Galloway Council leader Ronnie Nicholson said: "As we commemorate the events in World War One, it's important that we take time to respectfully mark the centenary of this momentous event, which took place in our region."
The programme of events on Friday included a march to Quintinshill rail siding, the unveiling of a roll of honour at Gretna Old Parish Church, a commemorative tree planting at Gretna Green war memorial, a reading of a poem about the crash and a wreath laying at Quintinshill Bridge.
On Thursday, a memorial service was held in Larbert, Stirlingshire, when a procession involving the military, community groups and local schools walked from the town's parish church to Larbert station.
The troop train had left Larbert prior to the crash.
During World War One the rail network was put under enormous strain. Old carriages, unsuited to high speed travel, had to be brought back into service to transport the troops.
The carriages which transported The Royal Scots that day were lit by gas. The hot coals ignited the gas tanks and set off a huge fire.
There were reports that some trapped soldiers were shot rather than suffer the pain of being burnt to death.
Those soldiers from The Royal Scots who survived the crash looked so destitute when they returned to Edinburgh that they were taunted by schoolchildren who thought they were enemy prisoners of war.
While the signalmen responsible for the crash at Quintinshill were both jailed, they served just over a year in prison and were reemployed in the railways after their release.

On Saturday, the Princess Royal and Ms Sturgeon will also attend a service at Rosebank Cemetery in Leith. It will also be attended by descendants of those who died in the disaster and former members of the Royal Scots.
After the service, troops will parade along East Claremont Street where Princess Anne will take the salute.
The soldiers who were on the troop train were from the Leith battalion of the Royal Scots.
The service on Saturday will be led by Rev Iain May, minister of South Leith parish church.
Like many people from the city, one of his relatives was caught up in the disaster.
He said: "Around 50 of the soldiers who died in the crash were members of my parish and when I was looking through the names for this service that I discovered my namesake, John May.
"It turned out he was my grandfather's older brother.
"He was 24 when he died, which is the same age as my son, and looking at photographs from 100 years ago he really looks like my son, which really brings it all home to me."
