The band will perform at the festival's new home at Strathallan Castle, in Perthshire, in July.
Pete also revealed details of their new album and the name of a new track when talking to BBC Radio 1's Zane Lowe.
The Libertines broke up after the release of their second album in 2004 but reunited last summer.
Pete spoke to Zane from a studio in Thailand, where he's now living.
"I'm really looking forward to T in the Park, a surging sensation in my gut. Can't wait to play again. Can't wait to get on stage and make some noise. It's always a good afternoon, makes it easy for me to have a good time," he added.
Pete also said that "it was part of the deal that we play some new songs" at the festival.
As well as making new music in Thailand, the 35 year-old has also been in rehab.
"Carl (Barrat) has been over, and we've been putting the new Libertines album together. All but ready to record now, I think.
"I think we might have written the song that we've been trying to write for years, to be honest. It's called Anthem for Doomed Youth.
"We sat by the pool under the coconut tree and we banged it out. And yeah, it's a blooming belter."
Festival Director Geoff Ellis said: "The Libertines are a truly iconic British band, revered as cult heroes by a generation of music fans and adored by the Scottish crowd.
"They chose Scotland as the destination for their live return on home soil last June, and raised the roof of the Barrowlands with two exhilarating shows.
"We can't wait to welcome them back in what is a historic year for T in the Park, as we take up residency at our beautiful new home, Strathallan Castle."
