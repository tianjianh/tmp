The 30-year-old clocked 48.92 seconds to beat compatriot Nicholas Thoman's time of 48.94 set in 2009.
The US led 74-48 after the opening day in Indianapolis and easily retained their 100% record in the event.
Tom Shields and Tyler Clary's first and third in the men's 200m butterfly secured victory with six races to go.
The USA have now won all seven Duel in the Pool contests, beating Australia in 2003, 2005 and 2007 and Europe in 2009, 2011, 2013 and now 2015.
They claimed eight of the day's first nine races but there was some European defiance once the result was determined, with Ranomi Kromowidjojo of the Netherlands equalling her own world record in the 50m freestyle.
Hungary's Katinka Hosszu also clinched her third win of the event in the 200m individual medley with Britain's Siobhan Marie O'Connor second.
Swimming in the final leg, O'Connor also helped Europe secure victory in the 4x100m freestyle relay, but the US easily won the men's 4x100m freestyle.
