[SN]TITLE[SN]
Wall hanging to celebrate Gaelic bard Rob Donn

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A Gaelic bard is to be remembered in needlework.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Born at Alltnacaillich, Strathmore in 1714, Rob Donn could not read or write and dictated his poetry from memory in later life.
A wall hanging depicting scenes from his life and work is to be created in a project led by Strathnaver Museum and Mackay Country Community Trust.
People living in and around Strathnaver are to be invited to help make the piece of craftwork.
Donn's poetry continues to be celebrated and studied today.
Some of his work has turned into music and performed at Glasgow's Celtic Connections Festival.
Strathnaver Museum has been awarded Â£5,400 from the Heritage Lottery Fund's Stories, Stones and Bones programme towards the project.
