[SN]TITLE[SN]
Bury 0-1 Oldham Athletic

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Oldham claimed a 1-0 win at local rivals Bury to register their first League One victory of the season.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Latics had failed to score in their first three league games but took an early lead through Leon Barnett's own goal.
Bury pushed for an equaliser but substitute Nicky Clark missed their best chance with five minutes remaining.
Oldham's early breakthrough came as Paul Green's cross deflected in off the head of Bury debutant Barnett.
The hosts replied with Danny Mayor firing wide but Latics' Lee Erwin then had a low shot superbly turned onto the post by keeper Ben Williams.
Erwin went close twice more before the break and Oldham continued to press after half-time, with Green firing over.
Bury finished strongly, with Clark seeing a close-range effort blocked by keeper Connor Ripley.
Ryan Flynn then broke, only to see Williams turn his shot wide, before Mayor exchanged passes with Zeli Ismail to square for Clark, but the Scottish striker scuffed his shot wide from six yards as Oldham held on for a welcome win.
