The 30-year-old - the first female rider to win the Melbourne Cup - required surgery on her pancreas.
Describing the pain as "pretty intense", the Australian revealed doctors have told her to take it "very easy" for the next month.
She said a return "won't be my focus for at least another month or so".
"I'm going to be guided by my doctors and how I feel in myself," she added.
Payne was dislodged from her mount Dutch Lodge at Mildura racecourse.
She has been ruled out of making her debut at Royal Ascot in June and taking part in the Shergar Cup team event at Ascot in August.
