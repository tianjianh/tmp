[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Four people have died after a storm battered southern Britain, leading to 625,000 homes losing power, and major rush-hour disruption to commuters.

A teenager in Kent and a man in Watford were killed by falling trees.
A man and a woman died in west London after a falling tree caused a suspected gas explosion and a house to collapse.
Many rail companies suspended morning services before running reduced services later. They say operations should be back to normal on Tuesday.
Flights and ferry crossing were also affected as the storm moved across Britain.
BBC forecasters say the storm, which began on Sunday night and saw heavy rain fall across many areas and wind speeds of more than 70mph (112 km/h), moved out of the UK shortly after 12:00 GMT - leaving a "broadly windy day" behind.
The strongest gust of 99mph during the storm was recorded at Needles Old Battery, Isle of Wight, at 05:00 GMT.
Wind speeds of 115mph were recorded during the so-called Great Storm of October 1987.

Bethany Freeman, 17, suffered fatal injuries when the tree came down on the caravan she was sleeping in in Hever, near Edenbridge, Kent, at about 07:20 GMT.
The caravan was next to the house she lived in with her family and she had been sleeping there while renovations were carried out.
Donal Drohan, 51, from Harrow, was pronounced dead at the scene after a tree crushed a red Peugeot 307 at Lower High Street in Watford, Hertfordshire, at 6:50 GMT.
Mark Joseph, who was passing by before the emergency services arrived, said: "We tried to assist, trying to get the tree off, but it was impossible."
The man and woman who died in west London were found after three houses collapsed and two others were damaged following a suspected gas explosion after a tree fell during high winds in Hounslow, the London Fire Brigade said. Three people injured in the incident were taken to hospital.
The Energy Networks Association, which represents power companies across the UK, confirmed 166,000 homes were still without power at 17:00 GMT.

A spokesman said 459,000 households that had lost power earlier had been reconnected, but more had been cut off as the storm moved north and eastwards.
BBC News correspondent Duncan Kennedy, reporting from Berkshire, said engineers had had trouble reaching some of the more remote areas in southern England because of fallen trees and it could be a few days before power supplies were restored to all locations.
Network Rail said the damage to infrastructure had been "worse than expected", with more than 100 trees on lines. Several hundred staff worked through Sunday night and into the morning to monitor conditions and react to damage.
Anthony Smith, chief executive of rail customer watchdog Passenger Focus, said it was "too early to tell if the industry made the right call when cancelling so many services, but the fact that major incidents have been avoided is good news".
Prime Minister David Cameron said the deaths caused by the storm were "hugely regrettable".
Asked whether train companies had over-reacted, he said: "These are difficult things to handle because you don't know for certain just how strong the storm will be."
In the morning, London commuters on the Tube and London Overground services also experienced delays.
The Environment Agency had dozens of flood warnings in place - in areas of south-west England, East Anglia and the Midlands where flooding was expected - but the number fell during the day.
