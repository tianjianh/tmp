More than 4,000 pipers and drummers from across the UK, as well as Canada, Denmark and Ireland, are competing.
The free event, which includes a food village and a children's entertainment zone, could help Paisley's bid to be UK City of Culture 2021.
Thousands of spectators are expected at St James Playing Field.
About 145 bands will take to the competition arena and look to impress the judges from the Royal Scottish Pipe Band Association (RSPBA) in 11 different categories.
After the final band performs the prize-giving will take place before all bands join up for the final march-past which will close the one-day competition.
Paisley 2021 bid director Jean Cameron said: "The sight of thousands of pipers and supporters descending on the town is not only a boost for local traders, but also enhances our bid to be named UK City of Culture as we again showcase our ability to hold large-scale events in the area.
"The winning bidder would host a number of prestigious events in 2021 and we're determined to give Paisley the best chance of a successful bid as we look to bring lasting social and economic change to the area."
RSPBA chief executive Ian Embelton said: "After the success of last year's championships we are all looking forward to an even more exciting event this year.
"Bands have entered in great numbers and everything is in place for a great day out for all the family".
