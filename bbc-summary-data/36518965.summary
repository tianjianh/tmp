Declan Gray was told he must serve at least 25 years in jail.
Judge Griffith Jones said it was a "ferocious and concerted cowardly attack" on Mr Hehir, adding that "using a steak knife was particularly ruthless and vicious".
The defendants, from Nuneaton, were among a group walking along Pool Bank Street in Nuneaton when they shouted abuse at Mr Hehir before an altercation broke out, Warwickshire Police said.
Mr Hehir died in hospital, police said.
A man who stole his wallet and mobile phone as he lay dying in the street was given 12-week suspended prison sentence in April.
