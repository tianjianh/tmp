The Tucson Roadrunners said captain Craig Cunningham had suffered a "medical emergency" before Saturday's home match against the Manitoba Moose.
The 26-year-old was treated by medical staff on the ice before being taken to hospital. The game was postponed.
The Roadrunners also called off their games on Tuesday and Wednesday.
Canadian Cunningham, who is under contract with NHL side the Arizona Coyotes, was skating around after the national anthem when he collapsed.
He is being treated in Banner University Medical Center in Tucson, Arizona.
Roadrunners head coach Mark Lamb said: "It's been a very emotional time for everybody, but I think everything's on the up and up, Cunny's in stable condition, and he's getting great help."
Vice-captain Eric Selleck added: "It was pretty scary for all of us to see first hand, so it's just been an emotional rollercoaster for us."
