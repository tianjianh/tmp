The 26-year-old, who has won 12 international caps for Scotland, has made 81 appearances since joining Sarries from Bedford Blues in 2011.
"I don't think he gets the credit for the wonderful work he can do with and without the ball," director of rugby Mark McCall said.
"His work-rate and contribution to this team is enormous."
Sarries have not disclosed the length of Taylor's new deal at Allianz Park.
