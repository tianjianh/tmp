Tommy Ward sustained a "significant neurological injury" when burglars raided his home on 1 October.
A safety deposit box, thought to have contained about Â£30,000, was stolen during the raid.
In an appeal for new information, daughter Jackie Perry, 52, described his attackers as "animals".
"They've walked away and shut that door knowing how seriously ill my dad was and they left him for dead, for the sake of money," she said.
'Attackers are monsters'
Mr Ward was found badly injured at his home in Salisbury Road, Maltby, near Rotherham, after the attack, which detectives have described as "vicious and cowardly".
South Yorkshire Police have released a graphic picture, which shows some of the injuries suffered by the great-grandfather, as part of their appeal.
Posters have also been distributed across the area in the hope they will jog people's memories and encourage potential witnesses to come forward.
Ex-miner Mr Ward's family - which includes his four children, 12 grandchildren and 15 great-grandchildren - described his attackers as "monsters" following the assault.
Det Insp Richard Partridge urged members of the public to contact police with even "the smallest detail" about the attack.
"What happened to Mr Ward was a brutal attack on a vulnerable man in his own home and those responsible do not deserve to be shielded by anyone," he said.
A box similar to the one reported stolen from Mr Ward was recovered in the Kilnhurst area of Rotherham two weeks after the attack, but Mr Partridge said he could not be sure it was the same one.
Two 19-year-old men arrested on suspicion of attempted murder and burglary have been bailed.
