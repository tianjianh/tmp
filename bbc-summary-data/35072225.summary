[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Paul Simmons-Turner, of East Ham, London, was killed in what police believe was a targeted attack on Tuesday at the Marriott Hotel in Waltham Abbey, Essex.
An inquest into his death has opened and adjourned.
Essex Police said the dead man had been wanted for questioning over an assault in Loughton in May.
Coroner Caroline Beasley-Murray, sitting at the court in Chelmsford, said she was waiting for a full post-mortem examination and toxicology report and the next hearing would be on 9 January.
Mr Simmons-Turner, a father of three, was shot in the hotel car park at about 09:45 GMT and then chased on foot.
He flagged down a passing motorist who drove him to nearby pub The Volunteer, but paramedics could not save him.
Police said a suspect was seen getting into a dark-coloured car being driven by an accomplice following the shooting.
