Five workers at Tata Steel, which is to start the formal process to sell its UK plants on Monday, were invited by the club to take the Save our Steel banner around the ground before kick off.
Swansea City said it was a sign of support during the first home game since the sale announcement.
A spokesman said closure would have a "massive impact".
"We are a Premier League club supporting premier league steelmaking," he said.
Indian owner Tata Steel is selling its entire loss-making UK business. Port Talbot is its biggest UK plant with about 4,000 workers.
