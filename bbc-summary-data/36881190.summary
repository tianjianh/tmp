Arriva Trains Wales said the line between the two stations had to be closed for a time on Monday morning.
The device was found in a garden in St Michael's Close, Ruabon, with a cordon in place and nearby homes evacuated.
North Wales Police said the World War Two bomb turned out to be a training device so did not contain explosives.
The line was close at about 11:20 BST and reopened an hour later, according to Network Rail.
A spokesperson for Arriva Trains Wales confirmed services were suspended while a bomb disposal team was called.
The company said services between the stations faced disruption until about 13:00 BST on Monday.
The device was found by a resident living in a block of flats.
The man, who did not want to be named, said: "We were clearing up at the back of the flats and a water butt was full of old, dirty water.
"We emptied it and found this thing at the bottom. We have no idea how long it had been there."
