[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
West Ham boss Sam Allardyce says he has been advised not to play Diafra Sakho until a row with Senegal is resolved.

Senegal are reported to have complained to Fifa after striker Sakho, 25, missed the Africa Cup of Nations with a back injury, but then played for his club.
Fifa rules say a player cannot play for a club if he is meant to be on international duty.
Allardyce said: "It is not conducive for us to be putting him on the field until it is resolved, sadly."
Sakho played and scored in last Sunday's 1-0 FA Cup win over Bristol City but was not part of the squad for Saturday's 2-0 Premier League defeat at Liverpool.

Allardyce said: "We have covered all the rules and regulations but at this moment in time it is sensible to do the right thing and not get involved any more - that is what I was told yesterday.
"If you speak to the lad you would know how angry and disappointed he is at being denied the opportunity to play football when it is not our fault."
Senegal boss Alain Giresse, who was told Sakho had withdrawn as he could not fly because of a back injury, claimed West Ham had "set a dangerous precedent" by playing him.
With Senegal eliminated, Allardyce hoped Sakho's countryman Cheikhou Kouyate would be on the bench for West Ham at Anfield.
But he said the 25-year-old midfielder told the club he was injured after they went to "great lengths" to get him back to England.
