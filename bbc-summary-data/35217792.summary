Leigh Centurions life president and club stalwart of more than 80 years, Tommy Sale MBE, has died aged 97.

Sale made his first grade debut for the club as a 20-year-old, helped rebuild their then-Hilton Park home and also represented Warrington and Widnes.
After he retired he served as coach, kit-man, administrator and time-keeper.
Perhaps his most crucial contribution was the signing of player-coach Alex Murphy, who led the club to Challenge Cup success in 1971.
His service to the sport and to Leigh was recognised with the MBE in 2011, and a stand at Leigh Sports Village was also named after him.
"I am sure I speak for the whole of Leigh in paying tribute to the legendary Tommy Sale MBE. We won't see his like again. A true gentleman," Labour MP for Leigh Andy Burnham tweeted.
"I will ensure a fitting permanent tribute to a giant of Leigh."
