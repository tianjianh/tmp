Welsh Premiership teams to trial six-point try

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Wales' second-tier rugby clubs will play under an experimental scoring system that awards six points for a try and two points for all kicks.

World Rugby, the sport's governing body, is expected to sanction the move, which will be implemented on Saturday.
New Neath coach Gareth Llewellyn expects it to have a positive impact.
"There will be a premium for tries now, so you'll probably have fewer kicks at goal from within the 22," the former Wales lock told BBC Radio Wales.
"Teams will kick into the corner and you can score tries from driving line-outs.
"I'm not sure it will change the game that much, just make it a bit more positive in the scoring zone so people will not just take two points when you can get eight for a converted try."
Currently, a try is worth five points, with a conversion two points. Penalties and drop-goals are both worth three points.
Rugby's scoring system has been subject to change throughout its history, with the try rising from three points to four in the northern hemisphere in 1971 - followed worldwide in 1973 - and the value being increased again to five points in 1992.
It is understood the Welsh experiment is part of an ongoing review of the game's laws.
The Principality Premiership is made up of semi-professional teams and includes some of the biggest clubs in the history of the Welsh game. Pontypridd, Llanelli, Cardiff and Newport all play in the league.
Llewellyn, who played for Neath before the introduction of regional rugby in Wales and played 92 times for his country, says his preparations for the new season have taken account of the points change.
"We will kick off with that on Saturday and we looked at it and how it will affect the game," he added.
"People have asked if it's going to lead to teams giving away more penalties because it's only two points for a penalty, but then you are going to end up defending more driving line-outs which you don't want to do."
The Welsh Rugby Union and World Rugby have not commented.
