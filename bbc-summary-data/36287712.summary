Some of Leeds' most well-known buildings have been recreated in cake for an edible art exhibition.

City of Cake includes baked models of the The Corn Exchange, Leeds Town Hall, Kirkgate Market and other landmarks.
The exhibition at Trinity Leeds shopping centre is part of Leeds Indie Food festival and runs until 20 May.
Ellie Andrews, City of Cake organiser, said: "It's a walkthrough, edible installation of some of the buildings that gives Leeds its cultural identity.
"It's to get people thinking, talking and appreciating their city."
Other featured buildings, which took several weeks to design and build in cake form, include independent cinema the Hyde Park Picture House and university building Broadcasting Tower.
Eddie Amon-Lebeau, food artist at Tattooed Bakers, said: "We start with a non-edible structure inside, then we layer up bits of cake around it and then decorate it in sugar paste.
"We estimate there is about 5,500 portions over all seven cakes, so that's quite a lot of cake."
