The chief executive of British Triathlon, Jack Buckner, said it was clear it had "disappointed" some people.
One participant said waiting to get his belongings back was frustrating after a long day.
More than 5,000 athletes took part in the competition.

Kalpesh Mistry, one of the athletes taking part, said: "This was not an issue at first because we were initially told to allow two hours from the time we start for the bags to make their way into town.
"However when starting at 09:20 and still not having my belongings by 15:30 I was beginning to get a little frustrated, especially with us then later being told we had to go back to the park and collect them ourselves."
Mr Buckner said: "Our ambition was to make this a really amazing event but it's clear we have disappointed some people.
"I want to apologise to Sunday's competitors who we let down through the mismanagement of the bag returns and I would like to thank everyone for their patience in collecting their bags at both the city centre and Roundhay Park."
The event, held in Leeds for the first time, attracted crowds of around 80,000 according to the city council.
The men's race was won by Alistair Brownlee, with his younger brother Johnny in second place, while Gwen Jorgensen took the women's title.
