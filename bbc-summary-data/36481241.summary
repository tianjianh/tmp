[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Chris Froome remains third overall in the Criterium du Dauphine behind leader Alberto Contador and Richie Porte.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
There is no change as Team Sky's Froome trails Tinkoff's Contador, by 13 seconds and BMC's Porte by six.
Stage three of the Tour de France warm-up race was won by Astana's Fabio Aru - also a Tour de France contender.
Aru broke away from the peloton with 12 kilometres to go, crossing the line a few metres ahead of the chasing sprinters.
Froome, 31, finished in the peloton in 23rd place along with Contador, 33, who had made a late bike change with a team-mate before returning to the pack, finishing 39th.
Froome won the Criterium du Dauphine last year and will attempt to defend his Tour de France title from 2 July, ahead of his bid for Olympic gold in the road race in Rio in August.
