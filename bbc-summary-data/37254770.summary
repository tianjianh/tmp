Rotherham abuse whistleblower Jayne Senior investigated

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An investigation is being held into complaints against the woman who first exposed the child sexual abuse scandal in Rotherham.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Jayne Senior was made an MBE in the Queen's Birthday Honours list in June for services to child protection.
Rotherham Council said it had received three complaints, and "an independent investigation is now under way".
Ms Senior is yet to comment to the BBC and the council said it was unable to "comment further" on the allegations.
The BBC understands the complaints are in relation to Ms Senior's role as a support worker for survivors of child sexual exploitation at the Swinton Lock Activity Centre.
Ms Senior helped reveal a pattern of exploitation in the town that saw large numbers of children and young people groomed, gang raped and tortured by groups of men.
At least 1,400 children were subjected to appalling sexual exploitation in Rotherham between 1997 and 2013, the Jay Report found.
Children as young as 11 were raped by multiple perpetrators, abducted, trafficked to other cities in England, beaten and intimidated, it said.
Ms Senior was elected as Labour councillor for Valley ward in Rotherham in May.
