The 28-year-old, from Banchory in Scotland, competed in two Winter Games - Vancouver in 2010 and Sochi in 2014.
Kilner also won a World Cup halfpipe bronze at Calgary in 2010 and had three other top 10 results.
He retired after winning the halfpipe at this week's British freestyle skiing and snowboarding championships in Laax, Switzerland.
Kilner set up his own gym business last year and told BBC Sport: "I would be lying if I said it was an easy decision to retire but I'm so busy with the gym, I couldn't commit to trying to qualify for the 2018 Winter Olympics.
"The elite level has really moved on and they're really pushing the boundaries. I'm just proud to have had a 19-year career doing something I love.
