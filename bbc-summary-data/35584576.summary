Kayden Jackson took full advantage of a defensive slip by Kelvin Longmead to fire home his first goal for Wrexham.
Jackson bundled home at the far post from Lee Fowler's pass to seal the win.
Goalkeeper Dean Snedker denied Jackson a hat-trick early in the second half while at the other end Rhys Taylor parried Arthur Gnahoua's effort.
Wrexham extended their unbeaten run to six games to move up to fourth in the National League.
Kidderminster, with only one away win all season, drop to the bottom of the table and nine points off safety.
Wrexham manager Gary Mills told BBC Radio Wales: "We had to work hard for the win. I was pleased for Kayden, he's got two goals.
"Three points, three wins, three clean sheets - it's what we've been after for a while and you've got to keep backing it up.
"We're not getting carried away, but a lot of people were writing us off a few weeks ago and not really thinking we could get in there.
"I always did. I always believed and I want to keep believing and I do believe that come 30 April we can still be in that top five."
