[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Burnley defender Michael Keane could miss his first league game of the season on Saturday because of an unspecified injury.

Ben Mee is another doubt with a badly-bruised shin but Stephen Ward and George Boyd should both recover in time from knee problems.
West Brom remain without Hal Robson-Kanu and Matt Phillips, who are both still nursing hamstring injuries.
Youngsters Jonathan Leko and Sam Field could feature at Turf Moor.
Alistair Mann: "This could be a weekend of celebration for Burnley, for whom a victory would confirm their first-ever successful negotiation of a Premier League season.
"Having already earned their greatest points tally and highest number of wins, it does seem that the security of their top division status is now only a formality - but there's no better feeling than achieving it in euphoric style.
"West Brom reached that similar target more than a month ago but, without a point in four matches or even a goal in five, will be keen to bring those runs to an end against a side they've lost to just twice in 16 league meetings."

Burnley manager Sean Dyche on West Brom: "They've shown over many years they're developing; they're a bigger version of Burnley.
"They had a head start in terms of their future planning.
"There was a time at the beginning of their journey where they put a lot of money in to get where they've got to.
"We're in the mix. Every club will have their own way of looking at how their business is done."
West Brom head coach Tony Pulis on being linked with a bid for Jermain Defoe: "When you say he's a free agent, effectively he's a free agent, but that still brings an enormous cost to whichever club takes Jermain.
"We've got our fingers in the pie on quite a few players and we'll see how we go on those players.
"If Jermain's one of them, we'll be pushing on that one if we can."
I see this being a battle between two teams who always put in maximum effort, and I think they will both have something to show for it at the end.
