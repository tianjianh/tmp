The chorus of Taylor's new single Look What You Made Me Do follows the same rhythmic pattern as I'm Too Sexy.
After the song was released overnight, the duo tweeted: "Thank you Taylor Swift, what a marvellous reinvention!"
The group's spokesman confirmed to the BBC they were approached by Taylor's team in advance of the release.
