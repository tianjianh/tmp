[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Mr Sultan, 32, was found at the back of the Herbs n Spice Kitchen in Lake Avenue on Tuesday night.
A large red performance style bike with a black seat was seen leaving Lake Avenue straight after the shooting.
Officers said witnesses saw one man get off the bike and fire a gun at Mr Sultan.
Northumbria Police said they believe the killing was pre-planned.
The shooter is described as being white, wearing tight fitting black clothing and a motorcycle helmet with a visor and gloves.
He was carrying a black bag, possibly a bin bag, that contained the firearm and spoke with a north east accent, police said.
The second man, who stayed on the bike during the shooting and was driving, was smaller than the passenger, was wearing all black motorbike type leathers, motorcycle boots and gloves.
He was also wearing a helmet with the visor down.
South Tyneside Superintendent Sav Patsalos said: "Anyone with any information, no matter how insignificant or small they believe it to be, should pass it on to the investigation team and let us follow it up.
"Our enquiries so far lead us to believe that this wasn't a random attack and that there was some element of pre-planning involved.
"We are still trying to establish a motive behind the murder and continue to have extra officers in the area.
"Last night local officers visited takeaways and businesses in the area to speak to owners and staff and reassure them."
