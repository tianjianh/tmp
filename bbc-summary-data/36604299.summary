Wladimir Klitschko: Tyson Fury comments 'sounded like Hitler'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Tyson Fury should be banned from boxing for comments which made him sound "like Hitler", Wladimir Klitschko says.

Britain's world heavyweight champion apologised last month for a video he posted online containing homophobic, sexist and anti-Semitic comments.
But ex-champion Klitschko, who fights Fury in Manchester on 9 July, said: "I was in shock at his statements.
"When he got to the Jewish people he sounded like Hitler. The man is an imbecile."
The 40-year-old Ukrainian, who lost to Fury in November to suffer his first defeat in 11 years, added: "We cannot have a champion like that. Either he needs to be shut up or shut down in the ring, or just suspended, because you cannot create more hate.
"I'm fighting a guy who can't hold his mouth on certain things."
The Campaign Against Antisemitism has also called for Fury to be banned and complained to the British Boxing Board of Control.
The undefeated 27-year-old, who took the WBA and WBO heavyweight titles from Klitschko in their first bout, later said he was sorry for causing offence and promised to improve his behaviour "as an ambassador of British boxing".
He was also criticised shortly after his victory over Klitschko last year, when comments on homosexuality, paedophilia and women saw more than 100,000 people sign an online petition seeking to have him removed from the BBC's 2015 Sports Personality of the Year shortlist.
