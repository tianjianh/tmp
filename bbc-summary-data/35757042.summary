[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Warrington shrugged off the loss of prop Mitchell Dodds to a potentially serious leg injury with a hard-earned Super League win at Catalans Dragons.

George King's try was awarded by the video referee with three minutes to go, before Chris Sandow completed the win with his late effort.
Rhys Evans' double and Ben Currie's effort added to the Wolves' total.
Catalans, already beaten by Hull on home soil, scored through Todd Carney, Pat Richards and Vincent Duport.
The victory was Warrington's fifth in succession, with themselves and Wigan the only two sides to retain 100% records so far this season.
It was a disappointing reunion with his former club for Catalans half-back Richie Myler, who saw his new side beaten and was involved in a heavy tackle by Chris Hill that saw the Wolves skipper placed on report.
Dragons head coach Laurent Frayssinous was visibly frustrated by the late video referee call for King's try.
However, there was little debate about Sandow's try that finished the game, which made it three defeats for the hosts in the opening five fixtures.
Catalans Dragons head coach Laurent Frayssinous:
"I think that there are rules in rugby league, you cannot move forward until the foot touches the ball at the play the ball. It's hard to kick, it's hard to play, it's hard to run, win the ground and get a quick play the ball when you have the opposition straight in your face.
"I think the guys had a dig defensively, but offensively we couldn't play tonight.
"I would be happy at some stage to have some feedback from the referee about some decisions he made tonight, but there is no point in me telling my players to work on combinations and create space when there is a game played like that."
Warrington Wolves head coach Tony Smith:
"We're oozing with character at the moment. We're probably not oozing with execution or smarts (smart play) at times, and we're coming up with a few too many errors.
"But we were pretty confident that we could get ahead in the game, but we needed to control the ball and use the wind in the second half and we didn't do that in the early stages of the second half.
"But about 20 minutes into the second half we felt like we were going to come home even stronger.
"Some of that was down to good defence, some good fitness and good execution. I thought our kicking game for the last 20 minutes was very good."
