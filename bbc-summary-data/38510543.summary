NIE Networks worked to restore power to the affected businesses - many shops in Royal Avenue were affected over lunchtime on Wednesday.
It said power had now been restored to all the properties.
"A fault in an underground electricity cable left around 240 customers in Belfast city centre without electricity," NIE Networks said.
"NIE Networks' emergency teams responded immediately, restoring power to all but 33 properties within an hour.
"Engineers are continuing to work to restore power to the remaining properties."
NIE Networks later said the remaining 33 properties had power restored at 14:24 GMT.
