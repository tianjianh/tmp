After talking to a local university to be looked at by a professor he learned it was something much more valuable; the bones of a 1.2 million year old Stegomastadon!
A Stegomastadon is an ancient mammal - a distant relative of the elephant, which used to live in North America.
With Judeâ€™s help, the Professor put together a team of experts to dig up the fossil in a way that wouldnâ€™t damage it.
It is now being prepared so that it can go on exhibition in a museum.
