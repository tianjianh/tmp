[SN]TITLE[SN]
Newport's Classy Cutz salon owner fined for playing music

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A Newport hair salon owner caught playing background music without a licence has been banned from playing any more tracks.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
An inspector visited Classy Cuts in Ridgeway Avenue, Newport, last September and heard songs including Photograph by Ed Sheeran being played.
The case against owner Sharon Staples was found proven in her absence at London's High Court.
The ban applies to any other premises she runs until she gets a licence.
Licences apply to any premises where music is played publically and royalties are collected by Phonographic Performance Ltd (PPL).
Fiona Clark, representing PPL, told the court letters were sent to the salon informing Staples she had infringed its copyright.
She said the letter invited her to get a licence, but she did not respond.
Speaking after the case, Christine Geissmar, PPL's operations director, said: "There is an intrinsic value that recorded music adds to businesses, and this judgement acknowledges that the performers of the music and record companies should be fairly rewarded.
"Businesses that choose to play recorded music without a licence may face legal action and financial and other consequences as a result."
