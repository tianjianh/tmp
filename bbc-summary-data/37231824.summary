Birmingham City: Bournemouth's Rhoys Wiggins & Burnley's Lukas Jutkiewicz join

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Birmingham City have made two loan signings by bringing in Burnley striker Lukas Jutkiewicz and Bournemouth defender Rhoys Wiggins until January.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Southampton-born Jutkiewicz, 27, began his career at Swindon before moving to Everton as a teenager, then on to Coventry City and Middlesbrough.
Uxbridge-born former Charlton Athletic man Wiggins, 28, has four times made moves to Bournemouth, twice on loan.
He arrives at St Andrew's with a view to a more permanent move.
The former Wales Under-21 international, who has made the full squad before, started his career with Crystal Palace.
Meanwhile, forward Nicolai Brock-Madsen, 23, has joined Dutch Eredivisie side PEC Zwolle on a season-long loan deal.
Birmingham City's deadline day activity has addressed a couple of significant needs. Jutkiewicz offers both competition and support for the hard-working Clayton Donaldson up front, while Wiggins becomes the first serious challenger to Jonathan Grounds at left-back in two years.
The fact that both signings are loans until January reflects the budgetary constraints that remain in place at St Andrew's, but also bear in mind the takeover of the club by Trillion Trophy Asia should be complete well before the next transfer window in January.
That does not necessarily mean Blues will suddenly become cash-rich, certainly not by current standards, but it may loosen the purse-strings slightly.
