It is believed to be the first time a Sinn FÃ©in leader and police chief have shared a platform in Northern Ireland.
"A vital element in moving the peace process forward was the change from the RUC to the PSNI," Mr McGuinness said ahead of the event.
"People like George have played a very valuable role in that journey."
He added: "Gone are the days when we had a police force, now we have a police service."
Mr McGuinness said politicians should support the police in the face of attempts by dissident republicans to murder officers.
"There are still people out there, who are a very tiny minority, who have little or no support within the community for violence, who are continuing to try to kill, particularly police officers," he said.
"In my own city, we had an attempt to kill a husband and wife - both police officers - just a few weeks ago, we had a further attempt to kill police officers in Lurgan and we've seen in Strabane in the course of the last couple of days yet another attempt to kill police officers.
"We as politicians have to be very concerned about that, I don't want to see anybody killed, I don't want to see any police officers killed."
However, Mr McGuinness also echoed comments by Sinn FÃ©in colleague John O'Dowd about the relationship between MI5 agents and dissident republicans.
"If we have concerns around what is a strong belief within mainstream republicanism that there are elements within theses tiny, unrepresentative armed groups who could in any way be manipulated by people who themselves have not come to terms with the peace process and the changes that there have been then I think it's quite legitimate to raise those concerns," he said.
