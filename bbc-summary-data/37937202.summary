[SN]TITLE[SN]
Aberdeen school knife strategy set to be approved

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A strategy aimed at preventing knives and weapons getting into Aberdeen schools will soon be approved.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
It has been drawn up following the death of 16-year-old Bailey Gwynne, who was stabbed during a fight with a fellow pupil at Cults Academy.
The council strategy has a number of aims, including raising awareness of the dangers of weapons.
Pupils, including some of primary school age, would be told about the consequences of carrying weapons.
And staff would be given clarity on how and when to search children.
The strategy, due to be approved in the next few days, could also see street workers deployed in so-called "hot spots" of anti-social behaviour, in a bid to engage with children.
An independent review into the death of Bailey in October last year found his death was "potentially avoidable" if teachers had known his attacker carried a knife.
The review, conducted by child welfare professional Andrew Lowe, made 21 recommendations.
The schoolboy's killer is serving nine years detention for culpable homicide.
