An unveiling ceremony took place at Bradford City Football Club's stadium off Manningham Lane.
The stadium was home to the Manningham side that won the first Rugby League championship in 1895. The club later switched to Association Football.
The game was called the Northern Union before it changed to the present name in the 1920s.
It was at a meeting at the George Hotel in Huddersfield that 22 clubs broke away from the Rugby Union to form the Northern Union on 29 August, 1895
Nigel Wood, the Rugby Football League's chief executive, said: " Bradford has played a significant role in the history and development of Rugby League.
"It is fitting that this contribution should be recognised."
Bradford Bulls play at the city's Odsal Stadium.
Councillor Abid Hussain, the Deputy Lord Mayor, unveiled the blue plaque before Bradford City's game against Sheffield United.
