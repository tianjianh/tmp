Police responded to reports of cars being driven dangerously near Marrowbone Millennium Park on the Oldpark Road late on Wednesday.
Officers found one abandoned car in the area and a second car leaving the scene at speed.
The police gave chase and the helicopter was called in when speeds reached in excess of 100 mph.
The car, a Volkswagon Golf, sped off through Newtownabbey, Doagh, Ballymena, Broughshane and Carnlough.
The pursuit ended when the vehicle crashed on the Munie Road, between Glenarm and Ballymena, at about 01:10 BST.
The occupants of the car made off as police arrived at the scene, but the vehicle was seized and is being examined by forensic officers.
Insp Paul Noble said: "The car has now been recovered and will be forensically examined.
"The gates to the Millennium Park were damaged as a result of the earlier incident and the abandoned car set alight in the grounds of the park.
"Enquiries are ongoing at present and I would appeal to anyone with any information to contact 101."
