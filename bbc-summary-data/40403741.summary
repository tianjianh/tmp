The 21-year-old made six first-team appearances after coming through the Royals' youth system but has spent much of his professional career out on loan.
Stacey played 38 times for Exeter City last season, helping them reach the League Two play-off final.
"He fits the profile of what we want from an attacking full-back," said Hatters manager Nathan Jones.
"He's young, he's hungry and wants to get better, so added to the experience we've already brought in, he's another exciting one for us."
