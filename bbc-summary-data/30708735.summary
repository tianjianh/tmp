Celebrity Big Brother 2015: The recipe for who goes in

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The 15th - yes 15th - series of Celebrity Big Brother's about to begin.

Since switching to Channel 5, the show has been broadcast twice a year.
Names being mentioned this year include US gossip columnist Perez Hilton, model Calum Best and reality TV judge Michelle Visage.
Even though the line-up is never confirmed until transmission, you can normally have a good guess at who's in it.
So here is the definitive "recipe" for a classic Celebrity Big Brother.
They're used to having their lives micro-managed on TV so getting an already established reality star to go on CBB is usually no trouble.
TOWIE, Made In Chelsea and Geordie Shore have all been well represented in recent years.
The alumni list includes Mario Falcone, Kirk Norcross, Lauren Goodger and Ollie Locke.
This time round, that box could be ticked by Ex On The Beach star Chloe Goodman.
Celebrity Big Brother LOVES getting a Loose Woman panellist to take part, presumably in the knowledge they're a little bit gobby.
Carol McGiffin, Denise Welsh and Coleen Nolan have all taken part before.
This year's representative could be Nadia Sawalha, who had an early stint on the ITV show between 1999 and 2002, before returning to the panel in 2013.
CBB's US stars aren't exactly known for their A-list blockbusters.
Instead, they're best remembered for their retro TV and straight-to-DVD films (although they're often dressed up as the "star billing").
For Series 12, producers got Dustin Diamond who used to play Screech in Saved By The Bell. Diamond is currently facing a different type of confinement - he's been charged with  stabbing a man in a bar fight on Christmas Day.
Meanwhile, on CBB series 5 it was Dirk Benedict from The A Team representing the US.
Verne Troyer (Mini-Me in Austin Powers), Michael Madsen and Gary Busey all fitted that bill too.
This year could be filled by Jeremy Jackson, who played Hobie Buchannon in Baywatch.
There's a formula for this one. Normal person gains infamy, notoriety or racks up the column inches in the tabloids.
After weeks in the headlines, Celebrity Big Brother comes around and said person goes into the house.
Deirdre "White Dee" Kelly went on the most recent series after getting everyone's attention on Benefit Street.
And former boxing promoter Kellie Maloney got signed up soon after she revealed herself to be transsexual.
The person to fill those shoes this time could end up being Katie Hopkins, whose comments - on anything from Ebola to overweight people - send Twitter into a tailspin around twice a day.
If you're too young to remember the days of Top Of The Pops and Smash Hits then don't worry because CBB likes to remind you of the stars who were HUGE in the pop world when you were playing with Lego.
Claire Richards from Steps, Abz Love from 5ive, Edele Lynch from B*Witched and Ben Adams from A1 have all taken part.
The rumour this year is that Boyzone's Ronan Keating could be making an appearance with Brian Harvey from East 17 and Kavana also being mentioned.
Putting a glamour model into the Celebrity Big Brother house means certain tabloids can plaster pictures of the model into into their papers for weeks.
Usually, when they're announced the biggest reaction is: "Who? unless you're a regular reader of lads' mags.
Recent signings include Lacey Banghard, Casey Batchelor and Nicola McLean.
The buzz this year is that model Cami Li will be going into the house. She was previously engaged to TOWIE's Kirk Norcross.
