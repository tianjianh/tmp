Steven Cook, 20, from Sandbach, Cheshire, was last seen outside a pub in Malia, Crete, asking for directions.
Cheshire police said Greek authorities had now confirmed the remains found in a well belonged to him after forensic examination.
The force said its priority was to ensure Mr Cook "is flown home to the UK as soon as possible".
The family said on Facebook they had learned their "much loved and missed son, brother, uncle, nephew, and friend will be finally coming home to be with us once again".
He brought "laughter, love and happiness" over 20 years and "shone amongst us," they said.
"Whilst we always carried hope in our hearts that Steve would come back much sooner and once again be able to share in our lives... sadly we will be bringing him home to say our farewells," the statement on social media added.
Det Insp Gary McIntyre said the family was "very appreciative" of all the support the media and the public had given them over the years.
Mr Cook's remains were taken to a nearby hospital after being found.
