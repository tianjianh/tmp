The other semi-final will see St Patrick's Dungannon up against St Patrick's Maghera.
Dungannon avenged their final defeat by Pat's Cavan last year by earning a 0-12 to 1-8 extra-time win on Saturday.
Cormac O'Hagan's free proved to be winning score at Corduff.
Thomas Edward O'Donohue hit Cavan's goal in the first half as the sides were level at 1-4 to 0-7 at the interval.
After Dungannon were reduced to 13 players and Cavan also had a man sent off, the holders fought back from two points down to move one ahead late in the contest.
However, a Ryan Coleman point ensured extra-time and O'Hagan's free secured Dungannon's victory.
