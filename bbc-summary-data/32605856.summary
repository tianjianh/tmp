Tennis star Andy Murray and an islands council have exchanged tweets about what is dubbed as Scotland's most remote tennis court.

Responding to a tweet from a fan about Bunabhainneadar tennis court on Harris, Murray asked if the place was real.
Comhairle nan Eilean Siar messaged the former Wimbledon champion to say that it was an actual place and that he should ask his mother Judy.
She played tennis on the privately owned court last year.
The comhairle confirmed the tweet had been sent to the tennis player.
Following Murray's Wimbledon win, the owner of Bunabhainneadar tennis court said the Scot would have to pay to play there, but rival Roger Federer could play for free because he was a Federer fan.
Murray will face Philipp Kohlschreiber at the Madrid Open later on Wednesday - just two days after beating him in the Munich Open final.
Murray won his 32nd ATP title - and first on clay - with a gripping three-set victory over the German on Monday.
The British number one is also building up to the French Open later this month.
