[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Luke Charteris says he would be happy to play in all four of Wales' autumn international matches if required.

The Bath second row played every minute of the 32-8 defeat by Australia and the 24-20 win against Argentina.
Wales face Japan on 19 November followed by South Africa a week later.
"I'd love to [play every game]. I'll play as much as I can and whenever I can for sure - after two 80 minutes on the bounce I'm enjoying it," said the 33-year-old Charteris.
"I had a bit of stop-start beginning to the season with a couple of injuries at Bath but I had three or four games on the bounce for them before coming in to this.
"I'm enjoying this and the more games you play consecutively the better you feel, within reason, but after 10 or 15 games you may need a bit of a rest but at the moment I'm feeling good."
"It is tough. My body is still pretty battered three days on from Argentina.
"I think the Japanese are probably smaller but it will be a faster more high tempo game so which will be a different challenge."
Japan beat Wales 23-8 the last time the teams met in June 2013, with eight of interim coach Rob Howley's current squad involved.
Liam Williams, Dan Biggar and Bradley Davies were among the players who started in Tokyo, when a large contingent of players were missing on British and Irish Lions duty in Australia.
"There's quite a few boys now who are regular players or in the squad who played on that Japan tour," Charteris said.
"It was some of the boys' first tour and they were disappointed with the result and I think certainly a lot of boys have stepped on from there and become regular starters for us now."
