The 19-year-old swimmer has already won the 400m freestyle and is favourite in the 800m later this week.
Sweden's Sarah Sjostrom secured silver with Australian Emma McKeon taking bronze.
Ledecky has taken her tally of medals at Rio to three, having won 4x100m freestyle relay silver this week.
Should she defend the 800m title she won as a 15-year-old at London 2012, she will become only the second woman to achieve the freestyle treble since compatriot Debbie Meyer completed the full set in Mexico 1968.
Ledecky, world champion in the 200m, 400m, 800m and 1,500m freestyle, will attempt to complete the sweep when she goes in the 800m heats on Thursday, with the final taking place on Friday.
