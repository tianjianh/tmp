[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Geoff Corkish confirmed the members of office staff at postal headquarters in Douglas have been given notice.
It comes after a decline in business from one of the organisation's main clients, Vivat Direct, formerly known as Reader's Digest.
Mr Corkish said: "We will try and find alternative jobs where possible."
He added: "We are hopeful a small number of staff will remain employed to undertake response and payment processing work."
The Isle of Man Post Office hope to keep business links with Vivat Direct as parent company, Better Capital attempts to restructure its magazine business.
"This news sadly highlights the difficulties businesses continue to face in this economic climate," continued Mr Corkish.
