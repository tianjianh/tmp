Three Britons have flown home after being arrested by police in China with other members of their tour group, the UK embassy in Beijing has said.

The trio were the among the last of 20 foreigners to be deported following their detention in Ordos, Inner Mongolia, on 10 July.
A family spokesman said there had been an "unfortunate misunderstanding".
The group was accused of watching terrorist videos but had only viewed a BBC Genghis Khan documentary, he said.
It was "to further their understanding of the region they were in at the time, and this may have mistakenly been deemed as 'propaganda' material", he said.
The tour group members were held at Ordos airport 30 days into their 47-day visit to the sites of ancient China and taken to a detention centre in the city.
Six Britons and five South Africans had already been released on 15 July.
The remaining nine tourists - three Britons, two dual UK-South African citizens, three South Africans and an Indian national - were freed two days later.
The final Britons to be released included Hoosain Jacobs, 74, and his wife Tahira, 68, from west London.
Explaining the circumstances behind their arrest, the Jacobs family spokesman added: "While the experience was distressing in the first instance, they say they were looked after at all times and treated well.
"The group is a mixture of multi-faith men and women from Islamic, Christian and Hindu religions who knew each other well and had travelled the world together in the past, including Israel and the USA."
He said the arrests came the day after a visit to the Genghis Khan Mausoleum at Ordos.
He added that nobody in the group had been charged after they were detained.
"It can only be assumed that junior officials who made the initial arrest in Inner Mongolia made a mistake, due to perhaps their unfamiliarity of the English language.
"The Jacobs family wish to thank the senior Chinese authorities in Beijing for the swift manner in which they have resolved this unfortunate misunderstanding."
A Foreign Office spokesman on Friday confirmed officials had been informed that the final three British nationals were to be deported.
He added: "Our consular staff have visited the group and have received assurances from the Chinese government about their health and treatment.
"We are in regular contact with the Chinese authorities both in Ordos and Beijing."
