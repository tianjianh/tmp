Riyad Mahrez wary of Leicester City's rising expectations

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Riyad Mahrez has insisted Leicester City will not let their fine start to the season alter their expectations.

The 24-year-old Algeria international has scored seven goals in 10 Premier League games to help City climb to third in the table after 11 games.
Mahrez, who has been linked with a move to Paris St-Germain and Manchester United, told BBC Sport: "We just take it game after game.
"We just want 40 to 42 points first, then after maybe we can speak more."
The Foxes - under new manager Claudio Ranieri - have won six and drawn four of their 11 matches, with their only defeat coming against Arsenal.
Winger Mahrez also has five assists to his name, while England striker Jamie Vardy has scored in eight consecutive games and is the league's top scorer with 11 goals.
Mahrez has backed Vardy to equal - or better - Ruud van Nistelrooy's Premier League goal record which he set when scoring in 10 successive matches for Manchester United in 2003.
Vardy can make it nine in a row if he scores in Saturday's game against Watford at the King Power Stadium.
"I think he can do that," Mahrez added.
"He has a very good character, he runs always for the team and he can make this happen. That would be fantastic and we will see the next game and the next game."
