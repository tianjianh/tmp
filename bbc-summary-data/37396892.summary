Inside Business: Recycling group ARC21 calls for 'circular economy'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Northern Ireland could receive a major financial boost if it implemented a "circular economy", a leading recycling group has said.

A circular economy is one in which the design of products is based around reusable parts, making them more sustainable and much easier to recycle.
ARC21's Ricky Burnett said the system, which drastically reduces waste, could provide an economic stimulus and jobs.
He was speaking on the BBC's Inside Business programme.
"We certainly have been pressing government to introduce that into the programme for government," he said.
"For instance, the Scots and the Welsh have really embraced it.
"In fact, in Scotland they have produced a circular economy strategy and there was a report produced in September last year that indicated that if Northern Ireland was to embrace the circular economy, that could equate to something like 13,000 new jobs."
Ricky Burnett's interview will be broadcast as part of Inside Business at 13:30 BST on BBC Radio Ulster.
