Lange will return to the role she played in London during 2000, for which she was nominated for an Olivier Award.
She will play Mary Tyrone, a matriarch addicted to morphine, opposite Irish actor Gabriel Byrne next year.
This is her third appearance in New York's theatre district, said the Roundabout Theatre Company.
The 66-year-old previously starred in Tennessee Williams' A Streetcar Named Desire in 1992 and The Glass Menagerie in 2005.
The play, widely considered to be a 20th Century American classic, will start previews on 31 March and open to the public on 19 April, said the company.
Lange, originally from Minnesota, won an Oscar for best actress in 1994 when she appeared opposite Tommy Lee Jones in Blue Sky, a period drama about a family moving to a military base.
She also picked up an Academy Award for supporting actress in 1983 for Tootsie, when she starred opposite Dustin Hoffman.
