[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Southern Vipers closed in on a Super League Finals Day spot and knocked out Yorkshire Diamonds in the process after a convincing 54-run win at Southampton.

Vipers' Charlotte Edwards fell for a first-ball duck in her first innings since her international retirement.
But Suzie Bates and Arran Brindle both made 45 not out, adding 99 to help the hosts recover from 19-4 to 118-4.
Linsey Smith's competition-best 4-10 saw the Diamonds dismissed for 64, handing the hosts a bonus-point win.
In a tie that pitted first against last, it was the winless Diamonds who took the early initiative when Katherine Brunt had former England captain Edwards caught behind and Sara McGlashan caught at first slip for six.
The returning Katie Levick (1-10) had Lydia Greenway dismissed on a slow pitch before Bates and Brindle slowly rebuilt, with just two boundaries coming off the bat in the first 16 overs.
New Zealand captain Bates and ex-England all-rounder Brindle eventually accelerated as both finished unbeaten on 45.
Diamonds skipper Lauren Winfield hit Morna Nielsen for two boundaries off her first over but was caught well by Brindle off Bates for just eight as the away side started their chase poorly.
With the Vipers spinners - Smith and Nielsen - claiming 6-28 between them, only Beth Mooney (17) could manage double figures as the visitors were bowled out for the lowest score in the inaugural Super League.
The unbeaten Vipers remain on course to top the table, with two matches remaining.
