The 58-year-old, who worked at Friends of the Elderly in Bridlington, is also accused of making a gain for herself through fraudulent execution of a will.
Two of the charges relate to allegations that she used the money to buy a house in Trowbridge, Wiltshire, in April 2014 and Scarborough, in September 2014.
Ms Sayles, of Sewerby Road, Bridlington, is due to stand trial at the same court in June and was bailed.
