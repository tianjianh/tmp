Rural areas in north east Wales to share £6m regeneration cash

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Rural areas in north east Wales are set to receive £6m over the next five years to help their regeneration.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The search is now on for volunteers to help target the money in rural parts of Denbighshire, Flintshire and Wrexham.
They will form local action groups with the regeneration agency Cadwyn Clwyd administering the scheme.
Cadwyn Clwyd manager Lowri Owain said: "The main qualification will be that they have their finger on the pulse of their area."
