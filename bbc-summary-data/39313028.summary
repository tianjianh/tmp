[SN]TITLE[SN]
Tranmere Rovers 1-0 Braintree Town

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Andy Cook scored the only goal as Tranmere kept the pressure on top two Lincoln and Forest Green with a 1-0 home win over Braintree.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Tranmere were denied the opener by some fine defending from the visitors as the first half came to a close.
A 25-yard free-kick from Jeff Hughes was palmed away by Ben McNamara into the path of Cook whose shot hit the post before James Norwood hit the loose ball straight at McNamara.
Tranmere broke the deadlock 10 minutes into the second half when Cook made up for his earlier miss.
The home side were denied a second with 20 minutes to go when McNamara saved a penalty from Hughes.
McNamara also saved the follow-up from Norwood, the player he had brought down for the spot-kick to be awarded.
