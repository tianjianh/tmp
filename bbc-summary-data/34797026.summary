That money includes £11,559 spent on shredding and £2,152 on skip hire - including £30 by Labour's Ed Balls.
MPs who lost their seats will have had to destroy confidential correspondence, and lay off their staff.
Other big areas of claims in the claims for May and June were for travel as well as home and office removal costs.
