Tom Daley and Dan Goodfellow earned Team GB a synchronised 10m platform berth for this summer's Olympic Games with a solid performance at the Rio World Cup.

Daley, who claimed an individual berth with World Championship bronze in 2015, scored 446.40 with Goodfellow at the World Cup to finish third.
Freddie Woodward earned GB a second individual 3m springboard Olympic place by reaching the semi-finals.
Team GB now has 10 Rio diving spots.
Georgia Ward, who attained an individual 10m platform berth on Saturday, achieved a career-best result by reaching her first final at a major event.
Daley finished fourth alongside now retired Peter Waterfield at the London 2012 Olympics, but told the BBC last year he would not contest the synchronised event unless he believed there was a genuine chance of winning a Rio medal.
He and Goodfellow decided to pair up at the end of 2015 and showed some potential in their competitive debut together at the National Cup in Southend in January.
Their performance in Rio was much improved - only bettered by gold medallists China and runners-up Germany.
With another five months of training before the Olympics, they will be confident of being in medal contention given the event will only feature eight nations.
With Jack Laugher having secured Team GB an individual 3m springboard place by winning bronze at the 2015 World Championships, it was left to his diving partner Chris Mears and Freddie Woodward to secure Britain a second berth.
A poor second round dive ruined Mears' prospects, but Woodward produced six impressive routines to reach the semi-finals and attain the Olympic standard.
There was also 3m springboard success for former British divers Yona Knight-Wisdom and Oliver Dingley.
Knight-Wisdom is set to become Jamaica's first-ever male Olympic diver after qualifying his nation a place, while Dingley claimed a Rio berth for Ireland.
The Team GB diving squad for Rio 2016 will not be revealed until after the Olympic trials in June.
