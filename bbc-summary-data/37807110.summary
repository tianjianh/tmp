Early goals from Paul Anderson and skipper Marc Richards put the League One outfit on their way to a straightforward success.
Harrow started brightly but were rocked in the sixth minute when they failed to clear from a Northampton attack and the ball fell kindly for Anderson to fire into the top corner from the edge of the box.
The Cobblers doubled their advantage five minutes later when David Buchannan crossed for Richards to nip in and score from close range.
Zander Diamond should have increased Northampton's lead from Matt Taylor's free-kick but he missed from close range.
The visitors recovered and had a couple of chances before the break, Josh Webb firing wide before Marc Charles-Smith tested keeper Adam Smith.
Richards scored the third in the 54th minute, heading home a cross from substitute John-Joe O'Toole.
O'Toole headed wide and Sam Hoskins was also off target before he rattled the bar from 25 yards, but O'Toole put the tie beyond doubt in the 70th minute when he headed home after being found by JJ Hooper's flick-on.
Taylor added a trademark fifth goal in the 82nd minute, curling home another free-kick from 20 yards before substitute Alex Revell crossed for Hooper to grab a sixth goal in stoppage time.
