[SN]TITLE[SN]
Essex firefighters accused of degrading recruits

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Two senior firefighters took part in initiation ceremonies that degraded recruits who were also indecently assaulted, a court has been told.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Recruits to Tilbury station in Essex were singled out and endured physical and indecent abuse in the late 80s and early 90s, Basildon Crown Court heard.
Anthony Benham, 50, of Stanford-le Hope, and Ian Maguire, 55, of Benfleet, pleaded not guilty to indecent assault.
They also denied 10 counts of false imprisonment between 1988 and 1997.
Firefighters have claimed they were tied to a stretcher and hung up in the air, locked in a small room which was filled with water and then urinated upon through a skylight window.
One firefighter alleges he was cling-filmed to a lamppost and had ice blocks attached to his private parts.
In another "extreme prank", a man claims he had a muscle relaxant rubbed over his private parts.
The court was told what happened at the station "went beyond any acceptable practical joke".
Prosecutor Stephen Rose said: "Both of these defendants took advantage of that culture of practical jokes and intimidation to engage and indulge in acts of indecent degradation to new recruits.
"This occurred in a climate of fear in which none of these young recruits felt able to challenge the senior firefighters.
"It would be obvious to both defendants throughout that none of these young men were consenting to any of these incidents of restraint or indecency."
Both defendants no longer work for the fire service, but Mr Maguire later joined the police and Mr Benham retired from ill health, the court heard.
Tilbury fire station closed in 1997.
The trial continues.
