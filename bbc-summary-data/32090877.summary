[SN]TITLE[SN]
Goole police station closed by unexploded Boer War device

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Staff at a police station in East Yorkshire got a shock when an unexploded device from the Boer War was handed in at the front counter.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Goole police station had to be evacuated as a result of the unusual donation, which was at first thought to be a World War Two shell.
Humberside Police said the offending item was a live explosive round about 6ins (15cm) long and 2ins (5cm) wide.
Army experts made the device safe and the station reopened at 17:15 GMT.
It was closed for about three hours.
The first Boer War was in 1880-81 and the further war of 1899-1902 is sometimes also called the South African War.
