The woman is in a critical but stable condition and her baby - delivered after the attack - is described as "doing well", police said.
Witness Daniel Birch said the 40-year-old had been "stabbed quite a lot" in the Sutton Coldfield attack shortly after 15:00 GMT on Friday.
A man was arrested in the "domestic" attack and he remains in custody.
Mr Birch said: "I ended up going towards the woman and holding her wrist because [it] was spurting out with blood."
He described "the biggest wound being in her stomach, where the bump was".
Passers-by flagged down police on Trinity Hill shortly after the attack.
A 41-year-old man, who police believe knew the woman, was arrested on suspicion of attempted murder and police have been given extra time to question him.
Mr Birch stayed with the woman until paramedics arrived and she was airlifted to hospital.
Police praised up to five men who "bravely" went to her aid in a "dangerous and volatile" situation.
Chief Insp Julian Harper, incident manager for West Midlands Police, said:  "They (the man and woman) are believed known to each other so this was what we call a domestic-related situation.
"As such, no other members of the public should be alarmed and should be reassured that we have what we believe is the only person involved in this incident."
He confirmed a knife was used in the incident and said one man initially went to help the woman before being joined by four other men.
"[They] bravely stepped into what was a dangerous and volatile situation, with complete disregard for their own safety and I commend them for their actions," he said.
