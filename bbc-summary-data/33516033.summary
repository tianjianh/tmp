It shows the pair being punched, and having their bags taken and emptied by another girl in Northfield, Birmingham.
The mobile phone footage has been widely circulated and viewed more than six million times, police said.
At one point the victims are ordered to their knees by the older girl and made to say "sorry" to another female.
Detectives have already spoken to two of the group involved, including a male youth who filmed the incident, and plans are in place to arrest the two female offenders, the spokesman said.
Inspector John Askew, from West Midlands Police, said: "The response from members of the public, clearly disgusted by what they've seen online, has been overwhelming and we've had lots of people getting in touch to provide names of those responsible.
"We have identified the two main suspects and plans are in place for one of the girls, a 16-year-old, to attend a police station for questioning later today.
"We understand the other main suspect is out of the country on holiday but we will speak to her upon her return."
The "unprovoked attack" was reported to police on Saturday night.
The force said it happened on Hilary Grove, although in the video a bag can be seen being thrown on to a dual carriageway road.
Det Con Dean Gordon said the violence shown against the girls was "completely unacceptable".
