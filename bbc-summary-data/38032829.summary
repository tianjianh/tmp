[SN]TITLE[SN]
Restored Cold War Vulcan bomber goes on display

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A British bomber plane used during the Cold War has gone on display after its restoration.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Built in 1963, the Avro Vulcan XM603 was one of 136 Vulcan bombers.
All of the planes, which were made at the Woodford airfield in Stockport, Greater Manchester, were retired after the Falklands War between Argentina and the UK in 1982.
The Avro Heritage Museum said the restoration was its "largest renovation project" since its opening in 2015.
Making its maiden flight for the Royal Air Force in 1952, the Vulcan bombers caused a stir every time they flew due to their unique shape and earth-shaking roar.
In 2015, the last airworthy version toured the UK with a series of flypasts to mark its final year of flight.
