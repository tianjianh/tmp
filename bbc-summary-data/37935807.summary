Wood recycling firm fined £20,000 for Newport docks fire

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A recycling firm has been fined £20,000 following two fires at separate sites.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A woodchip fire broke out in Alexandra Docks, Newport, on 15 December 2015, and three months later there was another in Maesteg, Bridgend county.
South Wales Wood Recycling admitted three environmental charges at Cwmbran Magistrates' Court on Thursday.
The firm was ordered to pay £29,120 in fines, legal and investigation costs.
Company director Dennis Burke, 67, of North Cornelly, Bridgend county, had two charges against him dismissed, as well as a fourth charge against the company.
The court heard the fire at Newport burned for six weeks after a pile of wood chips exceeding 8,000 tonnes caught fire.
The company's permit specified the piles should not have exceeded 7,500 tonnes and be split into two piles with a fire break between them.
Adam Vaitilingam, defending, said the pile built up after two ships which were due to export the wood chips out of the dock were cancelled.
He added that strong winds at the time caused the fire to spread quickly and nearly caused "a loss of life for several members of the team".
In Maesteg, South Wales Wood Recycling had paid a now defunct company to take about 3,000 tonnes of wood chips in anticipation of a new biomass plant being built on the site of the old Llynfi Power Station.
The company said it was under the impression the necessary permit had been secured by that company in order to store the wood chips on the site.
Aled Watkins, prosecuting, said Natural Resources Wales made repeated visits to the Newport site and warned about the dangers of storing the wood in one pile.
Over the course of the six-week blaze at the Newport site, South Wales Fire and Rescue Service crews made 106 visits totalling 888 hours of labour, plus 218 hours spent on the site by fire officers costing a total of £181,524.
The company said it had taken on board the advice from NRW in Newport and "far from ignoring" it, was in the process of trying to rectify the situation when the fire broke out.
The Maesteg fire burned for 10 days and was not on the same scale as Newport, the court heard.
That site is in the final stages of being cleared.
District Judge Martin Brown said: "The company had the foresight of the danger in keeping the material in the form that it did [in Newport]."
The firm was fined £16,000 for the two Newport offences plus £4,000 for Maesteg.
It was also ordered to pay £9,000 in legal and investigation costs and a £120 surcharge.
