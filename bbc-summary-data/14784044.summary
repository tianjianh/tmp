The Los Angeles-based director was admitted to a hospital early on Friday after suffering from chest pain and low blood pressure. He died on Sunday.
Mundhra was a director who made a diverse range of films, tackling many genres such as horror, erotic thrillers and social dramas.
Among his best-known films are Kamala, Bawandar and Provoked.
A graduate from India's leading Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Mundhra earned a Phd in motion pictures from Michigan State University before embarking on his film career.
Over the years,  he made films tackling affecting social issues such as Kamala and Bawandar, and erotic thrillers like Night Eyes and Sexual Malice.
Bawandar tried to bring to life the true story of an illiterate social worker in Rajasthan, who was raped three times but did not give up her fight for the truth.
Mundhra also made Shoot at Sight, a film based on the 7 July 2005 suicide bombings on London's transport system, starring Naseeruddin Shah and Greta Scacchi.
In 2006, the Congress party served a legal notice on Mundhra to prevent him from making a film about the life of party president, Sonia Gandhi.
"If some were too keen to hail him as a genius, others were equally enthusiastic in dismissing him as nothing more than a purveyor of sleaze. The reality lay somewhere between," wrote The Hindu newspaper.
