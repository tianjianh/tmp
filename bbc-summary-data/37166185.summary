[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Damien Menzies, 25, from Bathgate, attacked the child at a dance show in Deans Community High School in Livingston on 10 October 2014.
Menzies was convicted of attempted murder following a trial in June 2016. He had denied harming the child.
Sentence had been deferred for reports about Menzies' character.
The High Court in Livingston heard how the incident has left the child, who cannot be named for legal reasons, unable to walk or talk.
The court heard how medics have been unable to ascertain what effect the injuries will have on the baby's future life.
They will not know until the baby's brain is fully developed.
On Tuesday, at the High Court in Edinburgh defence solicitor advocate Ian Bryce told judge Lady Scott that Menzies maintained his innocence.
The lawyer also said the violence for which Menzies was convicted of was "out of character."
However, passing sentence Lady Scott said: "Mr Menzies, you have been found guilty of the crime of attempted murder.
"The jury found that you acted in a reckless and wicked manner.
"You lost control and you you shook a child violently.
"The child's life is immeasurably reduced. However, the full extent of the child's injuries are not yet known and will not be known until the child's brain is fully developed."
