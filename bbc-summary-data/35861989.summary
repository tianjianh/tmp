David Humphreys: Gloucester top-six finish in doubt after consecutive defeats

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Gloucester's director of rugby David Humphreys admits a top-six Premiership finish is slipping away after two "unacceptable" performances.

The Cherry and Whites lost 23-18 to basement side London Irish on Sunday, eight days after defeat at Worcester.
Humphreys' seventh-placed side host local rivals Bath on Saturday in search of a first win in three matches.
"We will bounce back, but these last two weeks have not been acceptable for this club," said Humphreys.
"To produce two of the worst performances of the season back-to-back is hugely disappointing and frustrating."
Gloucester are five points behind sixth-placed Harlequins but Sale and Bath both have a game in hand.
"We have been architects of our own downfall," added Humphreys. "The top six is now a long way off and we understand that. If you want to be a top six place, you have to come to places like Worcester and win."
