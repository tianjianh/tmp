Community fear Mallaig pool threatened by council cuts

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A community in Lochaber is fighting to save its swimming pool.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
One of the reasons for the opening of Mallaig and District Swimming Pool in the 1990s was to help fishermen to learn to swim.
More than 1,400 people have signed a petition to stop the potential closure of the building.
Highland Council could withdraw annual funding of Â£85,000 as part of its money savings plans. The local authority is consulting on its spending proposals.
The swimming pool is run by a not-for-profit organisation and funding from the council helps to cover the site's running costs.
