Carlisle United midfielder Gary Dicker says it has been "devastating" to see the impact of floods in Cumbria caused by Storm Desmond.

More than 2,500 homes across the region remain without power, with eight rescue centres open to the public.
Following Carlisle's 5-0 FA Cup win at Welling on Sunday, players offered to help anyone affected by the flooding when they finish training on Tuesday.
"It's the least we can do," Dicker told BBC Radio Cumbria.
"There were people after the game when we went over to clap the fans in the stands who've been affected - there was one or two who said their houses were flooded and they still made it to the game.
"It hit home on the way back, all of the foreign lads said they've never seen anything like it.
"To be so close to it and see how it's affected so many people is devastating."
