Members of the public not going to the Scottish Open should try to find alternative routes and avoid the A198 through Gullane, organisers have said.

This year's Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open runs between 8 - 12 July.
Spectators are also being urged to make travel plans in advance and stick to organised routes as they make their way to Gullane Golf Club in East Lothian.
More than 50,000 people are expected to flock to the event. There will be no public parking at the course.
Free park and ride services will be available to get to the event.
There is a regular train service from Edinburgh to North Berwick and a free shuttle bus will run from North Berwick Railway Station.
Tournament director Peter Adams said: "Every effort has been made to minimise travel disruption, both for spectators and local residents.
"The event is amongst the most prestigious in world golf and increasingly popular, attracting some of the biggest names in the sport to Scotland."
John McMillan, East Lothian Council's spokesman for economic development and tourism, said: "The village and surrounding area are very much open for business and I'm sure if everyone follows the traffic advice, spectators will be able to get to the course easily and local businesses can benefit from the influx of visitors."
