A young otter has been found "dazed and wandering" around an industrial estate in Port Talbot, the RSPCA says.

The animal was discovered by the industrial units at the Kenfig industrial estate, near Afon Cynffig.
"The otter was found cold and lethargic, although once I had put him in my warm van he started to perk up," said RSPCA inspector Nic de Celis.
"It's a young cub that may have been displaced due to flooding, following the heavy rain."
The cub has been taken to the RSPCA'S West Hatch Wildlife Centre for rehabilitation.
The RPSCA are warning people that before touching any baby wild animal, they should first monitor it as there may be a mother waiting nearby.
