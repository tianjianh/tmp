Staff at five recycling centres in Sheffield will strike next week in a row over pay and conditions.

More than 90% of GMB members employed at the five sites voted in favour of taking industrial action.
The first strike will take place on 1 October with a further five days of action later in the month.
French firm Veolia, which is contracted by the council to run the city's waste services, said it wanted to "sort any issues out speedily".
The city's recycling service is subcontracted by Veolia to the Green Company, which run the sites and employ the workforce.
Pete Davies, from the GMB union, said staff were working on reduced hours and received no extra pay for working at weekends.
"I wish that we didn't have to do this," he said.
"I wish that the decision-makers in this city would get round the table and resolve this and I have been begging them to do that."
The second day of industrial action will take place on 6 October, with a further four days starting on 10 October.
In a statement, Veolia said discussions between the union and the Green Company were still taking place.
The company added: "If strike action does occur we will do everything we can to minimise disruption and keep as many sites open as possible."
The Green Company said it was making no additional comment and referred the BBC to Veolia's statement.
