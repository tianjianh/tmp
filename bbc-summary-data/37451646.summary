The Blues drew with Swansea and lost to Liverpool in their last two league games before coming back from 2-0 to beat Leicester City 4-2 in the EFL Cup.
"It is normal when you start work in a new team and you bring a new idea and method of football you need time," said the 47-year-old Italian.
"But I'm confident about this and trust in the work. We can improve a lot."
Chelsea face London rivals Arsenal on Saturday at 17:30 BST and Gunners boss Arsene Wenger will celebrate 20 years in charge of the Emirates outfit on 1 October.
Conte will be the 12th Chelsea manager Wenger has faced in the Premier League.
"It is fantastic if someone is able to stay for 20 years in the same club," added Conte. "There is satisfaction in both sides.
"Sometimes I think it is important to value a manager not only if he wins, loses or draws.
"Sometimes if you judge only if they win you make a big mistake and you pay for this in the future."
Chelsea, who let in 53 league goals last season, have kept just one clean sheet in seven games this campaign.
"When we concede a goal, all the team concede a goal, not only the defenders," said Conte, who will be without injured centre-back John Terry against Arsenal.
"It means we must work together to improve the defensive situation. This problem was already there last season.
"We must work a lot on this aspect because if you want a great championship you mustn't concede so many goals."
