[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Alex Arthur believes victory for compatriot Ricky Burns over Julius Indongo on Saturday in Glasgow would be "massive" for the Scot.

Namibia's IBF world super-lightweight champion Indongo takes on Burns, who holds the WBA version at 10st, in a super-lightweight unification bout.
"It is a fight that could potentially lead on to a few huge unification fights," said ex-WBO champion Arthur.
"It is a very difficult weight class with some of the world's top names."
Burns is making the second defence of the title he picked up in May.
"For Ricky to leave with both the IBF and the IBO title on top of his WBA title on Saturday could lead to some massive fights," said Arthur, who also won British, Commonwealth and European titles across light welterweight and super featherweight divisions.
"But, of course, first and foremost, he has to take care of Indongo. He's just picked up two world titles basically with one punch, so he knows he is a dangerous puncher.
"If it looks like the fight is going the distance, I think Ricky will try to pick up the points, stay out of harm's way, stay safe and not walk into any of Indongo's huge punches and coast out a points decision.
"If the opportunity arises, I think Ricky will put his foot on the gas and he will go for the knock-out if he sees the opportunity.
"But, if he doesn't, I think he'll coast and box out a really comfortable 12-round decision."
Burns, 34, has won 41 of his 47 professional fights, including 14 by knock-out and has never lost by knock-out.
"He has to be considered one of the greatest Scottish boxers of all time," Arthur added.
"If you look at his record, even his amateur career, spanning over 100 fights, and the 40-plus professional fights he's had now, world titles at three different weight divisions, you have to rank him up their amongst the best.
"He gets smarter fight by fight and he realises he's not a young pup any more who can bounce all over the ring for 12 rounds swinging hundreds of punches.
"He is very picky about how he chooses his punches now and his tactics. He does a little bit less than he used to, but he makes it work for him.
"There's some massive names in his weight class - Terence Crawford, who he's fought before, Adrian Broner. They are talking about Anthony Crolla, the former world lightweight champion from Manchester, moving up to light welterweight - that's a massive fight in the UK.
"The potential of some massive fights in America must be really appealing to Ricky at this stage of his career.
"He would be wanting to win these lesser unification fights against lesser name opposition before going back into the ring with the likes of Terence Crawford, who he lost on points to."
