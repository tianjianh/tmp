Salford Red Devils still have money available in their salary cap to bring in players, says head coach Ian Watson.

The Super League side brought in Josh Jones last week after the centre was released from his short stint in rugby union with Exeter Chiefs.
Jones, 22, became the 10th new signing ahead of the upcoming season.
"Tim Sheens (director of rugby) was always keen on keeping something in the background, keeping your powder dry as he calls it," said Watson.
The 39-year-old told BBC Radio Manchester: "Obviously you like to have your squad in place, but it was also making sure we didn't panic and rush into it.
"We got what we needed to get in. From there we can pick if something becomes available, and luckily for us Josh has become available and we've been able to move on that.
"I believe we still have room in the cap if the situation arrives again now."
One of Salford's new arrivals is half-back Robert Lui, who has joined from NRL premiership winners North Queensland Cowboys on a one-year contract.
Asked what the biggest change has been since his move to England from Australia, Lui said: "To be honest, it's just catching the footy.
"When you're training it's real cold - your hands freeze. When I first came over the first two or three weeks were tough.
"I'm not going to say I'm used to it, it froze over on the weekend when I was playing, but I try not to think about that as this is what I sign up for."
