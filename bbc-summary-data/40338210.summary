The Northern Ireland Housing Executive has confirmed that the cladding systems it has used are not the same as the one on the Grenfell Tower block.

A total of 79 people are either dead or missing presumed dead after a huge fire engulfed the west London tower block last week.
Following the tragedy, the NI Housing Executive carried out an inspection of its 32 tower blocks for fire safety.
Concerns have been raised about the cladding installed on Grenfell Tower.
The Housing Executive confirmed cladding was used during the refurbishment of Eithne House and Cuchulainn House in the New Lodge area of north Belfast.
Whincroft House and Carnet House in east Belfast are currently being clad.
Last week, Colm McQuillan of the Housing Executive said the type of cladding on Grenfell Tower had not been used on tower blocks in Northern Ireland as far as he was aware, but that this was being checked.
"We have rigorously tested the cladding that has gone onto our buildings to an extent that it fits and meets all fire safety regulations," he said.
The Executive has now said that the cladding used in Northern Ireland is of a different type.
