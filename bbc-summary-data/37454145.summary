[SN]TITLE[SN]
No trial for St Asaph man accused of harassing priest

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man from Denbighshire who was accused of harassing a Catholic priest who he claimed abused him will not face trial.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Mark Murray from St Asaph will instead have to pay 1,700 euros - nearly Â£1,500 - in legal fees.
He went to Italy last year to face Father Romano Nardo, who taught him in Yorkshire in the late 1960s and told him the impact he had on his life.
The encounter was filmed by Italian newspaper La Repubblica and posted online.
In the film, the priest can be seen sinking to his knees and begging forgiveness.
Mr Murray was summoned to court in Verona earlier this year over the encounter and a hearing took place last week in his absence.
The judge found Mr Murray had not persecuted Father Nardo and his behaviour was not considered criminal - the case was dropped but Mr Murray will have to pay legal fees.
He is one of 11 men who settled out of court with the Comboni Order, formerly the Verona Fathers, for alleged abuse suffered during the 1960s and 1970s at Mirfield in Yorkshire, where he was studying to be a priest.
The settlements were not an acknowledgement of guilt by the Church.
