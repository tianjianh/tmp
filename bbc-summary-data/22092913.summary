Isle of Man TT star John McGuinness said he feels "emotional" about having a corner section of the 38-mile Mountain circuit named after him.

The road markers have been commissioned by organisers to honour some of the event's most successful riders.
So far only two have been unveiled, one for McGuinness, who has 19 TT wins behind him, and the other for Dave Molyneux, winner of 16 side car races.
McGuinness said: "I was nearly in tears when I found out - really emotional."
He added: "It seems unreal, when I am long gone, it is still going to be McGuinness's corner, I am dead proud, my mum and dad are too."
The 40-year-old former bricklayer from Morecambe is the outright lap record holder at the TT races and is the second most successful rider in the event's history.
John McGuinness and Dave Molyneux lie second and third behind Joey Dunlop in the success ratings.
The point of the course now known as McGuinness's is at Shoughlaigue and Molyneux's corner is at the end of Cronk-y-Voddy straight.
In 2002 the 26th Milestone on the TT circuit was renamed "Joey's" in memory of 26 times TT winner Joey Dunlop, who died in a racing accident two years earlier.
The previous road markers for the races have gone up for auction on eBay, in a move to raise funds to run the event and the first, from Ballaugh Bridge, fetched more than Â£1,000.
