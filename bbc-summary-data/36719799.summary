[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Ryan Hampshire gave Cas an early lead but Justin Horo restored parity and Thomas Bosc kicked Catalans ahead.
Hampshire went over again to edge the hosts in front before Frankie Mariano and Paul McShane extended their lead.
Fouad Yaha and Remi Casty gave Catalans hope of a comeback but Oliver Holms and Luke Dorn sealed it for the hosts.
Victory, which ended a run of five league defeats for Castleford, lifted them into sixth in the Super League table and ensured a second successive season in the top eight.
Catalans remain fourth place following their eighth defeat of the season.
Half-back Rangi Chase, who re-signed for Castleford this month, has yet to play for the Tigers again after failing to make the matchday line-up.
Castleford Tigers coach Daryl Powell:
"Clearly it's an important win for us. If you look at the way things have been going - Hull KR could easily win their next two games - so in terms of the whole season so far, it was a crucial game.
"We were a little bit scratchy at times but we've got to be happy we've been able to get the two points that releases a bit of pressure on us and gives us an opportunity to kick on for the rest of the season.
"There is a lot of improvement on what we did today but the frustration and the anxiety dies a little bit after today because we know where we're going to be."
Catalans coach Laurent Frayssinous:
"I wanted a response from last week and I thought for the first 20 minutes we were pretty good. The last 10 of the first half cost us the game. They were too good for us.
"It's a concern and it's up to me to find the solution. We need to fix some issues, the first point to get some boys back on the pitch and we also need to manage a few sore bodies who keep on playing.
"Hopefully we'll have some boys back in the next few weeks."
