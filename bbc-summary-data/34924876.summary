An exhibition of photographs displaying an "animated landscape" inspired by the Highland boundary fault line has gone on display in Glasgow.

The Island Drift exhibition shows trails of light photographed at dusk and night around Loch Lomond.
One image has a long line of light that leads the eye towards the boundary fault islands which span the loch.
The project, by public art company NVA, was in partnership with the Loch Lomond and Trossachs National Park.
NVA have produced public art displays like the Ghost Peleton and light displays at the 2012 London London Olympics.
The Island Drift exhibition, which took nine months to make, was created by designer James Johnson, photographer Alan McAteer and NVA's creative director Angus Farquhar.
Rangers from the national park and the crew of the Loch Lomond rescue boat also helped with the project.
Mr Farquhar said NVA wanted to "invert" the public art displays the company usually produced and make something purely for the camera.
"Looking in depth we realised where the Highland boundary fault ran, with the islands that cut across the reach of Loch Lomond, and became interested in the geology."
He told the BBC that 50 light units were manipulated to make the trail of light that mimics the fault along the spine of Conic Hill near Balmaha.
"We had some phenomenal light conditions. There's no digital manipulation at all. You got these incredible purples, oranges and slightly uncanny blue glows. They look hyper-real," he said.
"There's a complexity, beauty and unearthly quality to the art. It was worth spending those cold, wet and windy nights out in the national park to make it."
Gordon Watson, chief executive of Loch Lomond and The Trossachs National Park, said "It was an unusual and fascinating experience for our rangers to help the artists light up the landscape of the park to create these stunning images.
"The exhibition provides a unique perspective on the striking geology of Loch Lomond and we are thrilled that it will be on show. I would encourage people from the national park area and across Scotland to head to Glasgow for this unique exhibition."
The photographic installation at Street Level Photoworks in Glasgow runs until 24 January.
