Two weeks after the calf's birth, zookeepers are pleased with his progress, saying he's putting on up to half a kilo per day.
An adult pygmy hippopotamus typically reaches around 70-80cm tall and weighs around 250kg, about a quarter of the size of a full-sized hippo.
They are classified as an endangered species, so the zoo are delighted with the new arrival.
