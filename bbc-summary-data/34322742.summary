Car parks and camping areas at the Belladrum festival will open early next year in an effort to avoid a repeat of this summer's traffic problems.

There were three-mile tailbacks and waits of three hours to get into the site on the Belladrum Estate near Beauly on the opening day of the event.
This year for the first time the festival had three days of entertainment instead of two.
Bella's organisers have stuck to the three-day format for 2016.
The opening night of this August's event, a Thursday, coincided with the main day of the Black Isle Show at Muir of Ord and resulted in heavy traffic in around the two nearby events.
Bella attracts a crowd of between 15,000 and 20,000, while the Black Isle Show has up to 30,000 visitors over its two days.
Ahead of Thursday's launch of ticket sales for next year, organisers said the car parks and camping areas would open from 10:00 instead of the usual 13:00.
They said this would encourage people to "arrive in a steadier flow throughout the day and to reduce traffic congestion".
Organisers added: "Arena opening times will also be brought forward for the Thursday and details will be released in due course."
Belladrum in 2016 will be held on 4, 5 and 6 August.
Headline acts this year included the Proclaimers, Manic Street Preachers and Kaiser Chiefs.
Honeyblood, a support act to Biffy Clyro's headline performance at Edinburgh's Hogmanay celebrations this year, also featured.
