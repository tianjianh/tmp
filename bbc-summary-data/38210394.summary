The 20-year-old joined the Chairboys in August on a deal until January, and scored a hat-trick in Saturday's 5-0 FA Cup second-round win at Chesterfield.
The ex-Leyton Orient player has started just four games for Wycombe, but is their top scorer with nine goals.
"We are building something special here and of course we want to keep our best players," said boss Gareth Ainsworth.
