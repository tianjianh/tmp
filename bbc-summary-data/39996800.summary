[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Imtiaz Ul Haq, 58, suffered serious injuries to his throat during the incident at the Costcutter store in Queensferry, Flintshire, last December.
One man, Matthew Whelan, 29, from Mancot, has already pleaded guilty to robbery and attempted murder.
His alleged accomplice Leslie Peter Baines, 47, from Connah's Quay, is on trial for robbery at Mold Crown Court.
The prosecution's case is that Mr Baines was aware of Whelan's attack on Mr Ul Haq but did nothing.
The court was told the men had spent the night before the robbery drinking together at a house in Queensferry.
The pair walked to Costcutter just before 18:30 on 8 December, with CCTV showing Mr Baines entering the shop followed by Whelan who was armed with a knife.
Whelan went behind the counter and attacked Mr Ul Haq but Mr Baines remained at the scene, the court was told.
He told a police officer that his fingerprints would be found on Mr Ul Haq's mobile phone as he used it to phone 999 for an ambulance.
Whelan was arrested within the hour at a nearby caravan park.
Police viewed CCTV and then Mr Baines was arrested at 01:30 on 9 December.
A search of a garden shed found clothing including a black jacket appearing to be stained with blood.
The trial continues.
