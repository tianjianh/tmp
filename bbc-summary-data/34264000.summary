Culture Secretary Fiona Hyslop quizzed on T in the Park payment

Culture Secretary Fiona Hyslop will appear before a Holyrood committee to explain why the T in the Park festival was given £150,000 of public money.

The one-off payment was given to event organisers DF Concerts to help the music festival re-locate from its Kinross venue to Strathallan Castle.
A Scottish government spokeswoman said Ms Hyslop was "looking forward" to giving evidence.
Scottish Labour has called for a full statement to Parliament.
The row about the money centres on a meeting former SNP adviser Jennifer Dempsie set up between Ms Hyslop and DF Concerts.
Ms Dempsie was working on a contract for DF Concerts as a festival project manager at the time of the meeting, which took place ahead of the grant being awarded.
A Scottish government spokeswoman said: "Culture Secretary Fiona Hyslop looks forward to giving evidence to the Education and Culture Committee further to the full answer provided to Parliament on August 14, 2015.
"T in the Park is one of Scotland's most popular and successful cultural events, generating £15.4m for the economy last year and supporting tourism and jobs."
Scottish Labour have questioned why money was given to such a successful company as DF concerts.
The party's business manager James Kelly said: "The questions around this deal are much bigger than the political ambitions of a former SNP adviser.
"I welcome that the culture minister is to face a Holyrood committee but there should be a statement to the full chamber.
"T in the Park is a successful business, at a time when our public services are facing unprecedented cuts from Holyrood gifting £150,000 in taxpayer cash seems very hard to justify."
Conservative culture spokeswoman Liz Smith said it was "imperative that the Culture Secretary puts the full facts on the table".
She added: "For far too long, the funding of T in the Park has been clouded in mystery with the inevitable result that the public felt the Scottish government had something to hide.
"Before any decision is made about T in the Park 2016, everyone needs a categorical assurance that there will be full transparency over the decision-making process which was so absent for T in the Park 2015."
Liberal Democrat MSP Liam McArthur, a committee member, said: "It is still unclear as to why the Scottish government granted a profitable company £150,000 in state aid for an event that had already taken place.
"Statements from the Culture Secretary so far have told us next to nothing, so I welcome the fact that the Education Committee has agreed to take action."
