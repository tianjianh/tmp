[SN]TITLE[SN]
London's Crossrail to be called the Elizabeth Line

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Crossrail, the new railway which will run beneath London, is to be named the Elizabeth Line in honour of the Queen, Boris Johnson has announced.

London's mayor revealed the line's name and purple logo as he visited Bond Street station with the monarch.
Trains on the railway will travel under the centre of the city, linking parts of Berkshire and Buckinghamshire to Essex when it opens in December 2018.
Mr Johnson said it was "wonderful" the line had "such a significant name".
"The Elizabeth Line will provide a lasting tribute to our longest-serving monarch", the mayor said.
The Queen visited a station construction site 28m (92ft) below ground where she viewed part of the tunnel and met construction apprentices.
Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin, who was also at the event, said the name was "very fitting" given the Queen's long association with UK transport.
About 24 trains an hour will travel both ways on the new Elizabeth Line when it opens.
