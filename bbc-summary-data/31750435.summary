[SN]TITLE[SN]
Extra pub hours suggested for taking spirits at Halloween

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Highland Licensing Board is asking the public whether extended opening times should be available to pubs and clubs on Burns Night and Halloween.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The board generally grants premises extended hours at Christmas and New Year, unless there are reasons for refusing permission.
It has now started public consultation on a plan to apply the same approach to other times of the year.
Extended hours may also be made more readily available during big events.
These include the Royal National Mod.
Board chairwoman Maxine Smith said: "We are looking for as many people as possible to take part and let us know their views."
The consultation period runs until 17 April and the board will consider the responses at a meeting in Inverness on 12 May.
