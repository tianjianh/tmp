Rudimental: Behind the scenes on their UK tour

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
On Thursday night, East London dance band Rudimental played their first ever headline show at London's O2 Arena. They gave the BBC exclusive access to the rehearsals and revealed why their London shows are "cursed".

When it's empty, the O2 Arena is cold. Stupidly cold.
That's why, on Thursday afternoon, you could find Rudimental on stage in scarves, trench coats and hoodies, warming up for their first headline show at the venue.
"It's like Rudimental: The Winter Collection," observes their press officer from the side of the stage.
The soundcheck lasts a couple of hours, as the band rehearse hits like Waiting All Night, Rumour Mill and Bloodstream (with touring vocalist Tom Jules standing in for an absent Ed Sheeran).
It's all very serious. The singers have their heads bowed in concentration, trying to acclimatise to the arena's booming acoustics; while musical director Andy Gangadeen interrupts the band with advice - watch the tempo, turn the guitars up, try that section again.
From time to time band members abandon their instruments, climb down from the stage and check out the sound mix.
"It's one of the real opportunities of being in such a big band," says Leon Rolle, aka DJ Locksmith. "There's times when you're not playing, so you're able to go out to the front and hear how it sounds, then go back up and say 'that doesn't seem right'."
Four hours later, with the O2 packed to the rafters, the trenchcoats have been abandoned and the band bound onto stage with the energy of 10,000 Duracell bunnies.
"Make some noise," screams keyboard player and chief rabble-rouser Kesi Dryden. Some noise is duly made.
The adrenalin levels don't drop over the next two hours, as the band race through the highlights of their two number one albums, Home and We The Generation.
"It's crazy," Rolle says. "I'd love to say we're tremendous athletes - I used to be a semi-professional footballer - but being on stage is like a release.
"Whether you're working in Tesco or a musician striving to become the best, you're going to have your down moments, and sometimes you feel like there's a lot of them.
"So when we get to that pinnacle moment when we're on stage, all our energy explodes."
"It comes naturally," adds Dryden. "Even if you've been on the road for days, as soon as you play the first couple of notes and see all your mates around you, the energy just comes to you."
The O2 gig is the latest achievement for the London-born band, who went from playing their first gig to being festival headliners in just three years.
They honed their skills by watching videos of funk acts like Parliament and James Brown - studying their on-stage dynamics and ability to bridge the gap between performers and fans.
"We like to take you to church," says producer and multi-instrumentalist Amir Amor.
Before every show, hypeman Dryden gives a motivational speech to his bandmates: "Rudimental has a massive message to send," goes a typical speech. "And we're doing it. We're making a story right here."
The message is one of unbridled positivity, says Rolle. "It's all about peace, love, good vibes. It doesn't matter what you look like, or how many toes or non-toes you have. It's all about standing up for what you believe in, and going out there and achieving it."
Their refusal to accept boundaries is born of experience. Rudimental's core members - Dryden, Amor, Rolle and Piers Aggett - are childhood friends, raised in Hackney. They set up their own studio, talent-spotted singers (John Newman, who fronted their breakout hit Feel The Love, was discovered at a pub open mic night) and created their own sound - a blend of dance, rave, drum and bass and reggae.
Success has been rapid, but not always welcome.
"Rudimental are just like your average Joes," says Rolle. "We don't quite know how to deal with getting stopped in the street. We shy away from all that. But we love making music and we love playing music."
What keeps them "humble", he says, is the band's "family vibe".
That's also why, when one of the vocalists leaves to pursue a solo career - as happened with Ella Eyre, John Newman and Becky Hill - the group can put a newcomer on stage in front of 18,000 people without worrying that nerves will make them freeze up.
"It is a tough one, introducing new vocalists. And it's tough for them to step up," says Dryden. "But we've got some amazing singers with us at the moment and they're great mentors."
"I think it's just the Rudimental schooling and the Rudimental family vibe," adds Rolle. "As soon as you walk into the dressing room, you feel welcome."
The band are already looking for a new singer as Anne-Marie, who sings on their current single Rumour Mill, finishes her debut album.
She won her place in the band after bringing a tray of home-made brownies to her audition. So is baking the best way to secure a place in the Rudimental squad?
"It might be," laughs Dryden. "But it's quite funny. Anne-Marie's been on the road with us for two years now and she's never baked anything again.
"Those brownies might have been from Sainsbury's. They tasted a bit too good!"
A day after the O2 show, the band are ecstatic.
"It was amazing. Definitely a moment to remember," says Dryden. "Every now and again when I was half-way through a song, I'd take a glimpse at the arena and see all these people and think, 'wow, this is pretty special'."
What they didn't reveal ahead of the show, however, is that Rudimental's London shows are "cursed".
"Something always goes wrong with one of our vocalists, or a band member," confesses Rolle,  "whether it be a throat infection or someone getting ill."
Last night, it was Rolle and Anne-Marie who suffered - both of them contracting a throat infection before the show.
"It was looking like they might not be able to get on stage with us," reflects Dryden.
"The funny thing is, that's why we scheduled the London date half-way through the UK tour. Usually it comes at the end, and by that point everyone's losing their voice.
"So we thought let's have it half-way and everyone would be fresh and ready to go. It didn't quite work out like that."
"We always manage to get through it though," says Rolle. "We're such a big family on stage that people can take other people's parts and whatnot.
"I suppose that's one of the plusses of having a big band."
Rudimental's tour continues around the UK, ending in Manchester on Tuesday, 8 March.
