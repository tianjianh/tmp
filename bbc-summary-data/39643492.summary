World Championship 2017: Stuart Carrington 'amazed' to join three-ton group

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Stuart Carrington said joining an elite group to score three consecutive centuries at the World Championship was one of many positives from his first-round defeat against Liang Wenbo.

He followed John Higgins, Mark Selby, Ronnie O'Sullivan and Neil Robertson into the triple-ton record books with breaks of 124, 101 and 107.
"To be in that bracket is amazing," the 26-year-old Grimsby potter said.
But the world number 48 described the 10-7 loss as a missed opportunity.
Carrington trailed 2-0 before a magnificent response on his second appearance at snooker's showpiece event saw him score two 50s and three centuries to take control at 5-2.

China's Liang hit back to go in 5-4 down at the end of the first session and his matchplay began to grind down his less experienced opponent in an increasingly scratchy second session.
"It was pretty good up until the last few frames, when I went so flat," Carrington added."I wasn't nervous but I played so many careless shots.
"He didn't play exceptional to win it. At the end I sort of gifted it to him and I don't know why.
"I came into tonight full of confidence from the first session, but the match didn't really flow; we both missed a few and ran out of position. I hit so many safety shots all wrong and I was just leaving him free shots.
"But it's all good experience. There are a lot of positives.
"Overall, it's been a great season."
