Jamie Mines was injured at the Kendrick Industrial Estate in Swindon just before Christmas.
A fund to help the semi-professional football player from Frome has already raised £113,000.
Local people have also organised a football tournament at his former club - Frome Town - to raise more funds.
Mr Mines, who also plays for Radstock, Larkhall and Paulton football clubs, is well-known locally where he is described as a "goal machine".
Following the accident, into which the Health and Safety Executive is investigating, the 33-year-old was placed in an induced coma at Southmead Hospital in Bristol.
He also missed his first Christmas with his five-month-old twins Isabella and Savannah.
Family friend Billy Wright said he was "doing really well" and undergoing "intensive rehabilitation" at a specialist centre in Oxford.
"There's no doubt that the support the town of Frome, the entire country and the footballing community have shown James, has really, really helped him," he said.
"He's completely overwhelmed - the support that's come through has really given him the positivity to fight."
