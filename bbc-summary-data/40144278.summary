The Bennetts Suzuki rider's lap was faster than BMW  pair Peter Hickman (130.63) and Ian Hutchinson (130.33).
Manxman Dan Kneen and Michael Rutter were also over the 130mph mark.
Hutchinson remained quickest Superstock with 129.53, while William Dunlop moved top of the Supersport leaderboard with a lap of 125.30.
Martin Jessopp headed the Supertwins thanks to a speed of 116.53 on Saturday, while Ivan Lintin and Peter Hickman were close behind.
The action was punctuated by a series of red flag incidents, with Lee Johnston, Danny Webb and Paul Jordan all recovering from minor injuries in hospital.
TT organisers decided to use Saturday as a further practice session after qualifying had been disrupted throughout the week because of adverse weather.
As a result, the opening race of the meeting, the Superbike will now take place more than 24 hours later than scheduled on Sunday at 14:00 BST.
