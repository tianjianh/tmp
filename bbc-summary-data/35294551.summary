James Anderson: England veteran still excited by Test cricket

Veteran England seamer James Anderson says he is still fully dedicated to Test cricket but that it faces pressure from the rising popularity of Twenty20.

England's leading wicket-taker made his Test debut in 2003 - two years before the first T20 international.
The 33-year-old, who returned from injury in the second Test against South Africa, said: "It still excites me. I prioritise it in my head and my heart.
"It is what I will concentrate on doing for the foreseeable future."
While Test cricket is finding it difficult to compete with the huge crowds and big salaries in the shorter format of the game, a stadium-record 85,095 fans turned out for the drawn match in Cape Town, where Ben Stokes scored the fastest double-century in Tests by an Englishman.
Another bumper crowd is anticipated at the Wanderers in Johannesburg for the third Test on Thursday as the Proteas attempt to prevent the tourists clinching the series after their first-Test victory.
Anderson has 427 Test wickets in 111 Tests, but played the last of his 19 T20 internationals in 2009, against South Africa in Centurion.
He added: "There is a slight worry with the domestic T20 competitions doing so well.
"But speak to players and there is a still a passion to play Test cricket. It's a real test of someone's character and skill, to perform in this form of the game.
"Hopefully it's not just players but fans too, because we need people to keep supporting the game so that it does flourish."
