[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Michael Davies, 71, from Blaina, Blaenau Gwent, was staying at Hotel Maria in Sandown with his wife Pat when he disappeared.
Hampshire Constabulary said Mr Davies wandered off from the hotel at 21:30 BST on Tuesday 26 May and was later seen less than half a mile inland.
Two of Mr Davies' granddaughters have urged him to return.
Ellinor Trigg, 24, and Kelly Davies, 31, said in a statement: "We'd like to say to Granch that everyone is thinking about you, we all miss you and want you to come home.
"We feel like we're in limbo right now, we can't do anything until we know where you've gone.
"Please get in contact to let us know you're alright."
"Our appeal to anyone who sees him is to introduce yourself gently to him.
"Talk to Mike about his many interests and hobbies. He has a passion for old British motorbikes, pocket watches, cycling in Wales, old coin collections, and making ginger beer.
"He likes to watch the TV comedy programmes Only Fools and Horses and Rab C Nesbitt."
Mr Davies is described as white with cropped white hair and was wearing a blue T-shirt, a blue Reebok jumper, jeans and a baseball cap when he went missing.
