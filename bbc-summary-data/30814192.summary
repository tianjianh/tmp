One Direction's tweet now more popular than Obama post

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A tweet from One Direction's Louis Tomlinson to Harry Styles has become the second most retweeted post of all time.

It's overtaken Barack Obama's famous "four more years" tweet.
When Obama sent the message after being re-elected in 2012, he made history by being retweeted more than half a million times in a few hours and smashed previous records.
It's now been shared more than 750,000 times.
But the One Direction tweet from 2011 in which Louis said Harry was "always in my heart" is now more popular, having been retweeted more than 780,000 times.
Both still have a long way to go to beat the famous Oscar selfie posted by Ellen DeGeneres. So far that has been retweeted more than three million times.
