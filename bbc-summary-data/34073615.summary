An AM has called for a meeting with high street bank bosses to oppose the closure of a NatWest branch in Powys.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Kirsty Williams, AM for Brecon and Radnorshire, said the planned closure of the bank in Crickhowell in November was "very bad news".
The bank said it was making provision for customers at nearby post offices. It also said it was investing Â£600,000 at the nearest branch at Abergavenny.
NatWest is to close 11 branches in north Wales in September.
It blamed the closures on a "wide range of factors" including usage.
