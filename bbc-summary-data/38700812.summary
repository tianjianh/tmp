[SN]TITLE[SN]
Preston North End 1-1 Ipswich Town

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Jordan Hugill scored a last-minute goal for Preston to rescue a point against Ipswich, a side that has twice attempted to sign the striker in the past two weeks.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Tom Lawrence had put the visitors ahead, cutting in from the left to curl beyond goalkeeper Chris Maxwell.
Ipswich keeper Bartosz Bia≈Çkowski made a series of saves from Paul Gallagher, Callum Robinson and Aiden McGeady.
Preston continued to press, with Hugill pouncing with a close-range equaliser.
Preston's leading scorer Hugill started for the hosts just two days after Ipswich's second approach for the striker was turned down the Lilywhites.
He threatened early on and earned Simon Grayson's side a share of the spoils in a tense climax, which also saw Jermaine Beckford threaten.
The draw moves Preston up a place to 10th in the Championship table, while Mick McCarthy's side earn their first point away from home in three games to stay 14th.
Lawrence's sixth goal in six games means that only one of Ipswich's seven goals since the start of 2017 has not been scored by the winger.
Preston North End manager Simon Grayson:
"It was always going to be tough against Ipswich. They're resilient and well-organised, and we struggled to break them down.
"It wasn't our best performance, but we kept plugging away and asking questions, and in the end we gained our reward.
"I hope he [Hugill] keeps scoring goals, of course. He did well to follow up his couple at Villa with another well-taken one here."
Ipswich Town manager Mick McCarthy:
"We're disappointed, to be honest. Of course we thought we'd done enough to hang on, but the late goal was a big blow.
"It wasn't the best of crosses at the end, and then sod's law the ball falls to Hugill. To be fair to the lad he tucked his shot away well.
"We defended really well throughout the game, but then to concede so late is frustrating.
"We could have done with a bit better concentration at the back there, but I can't complain too much."
