Former England captain Steven Gerrard has backed the Football Association to "get it right" with their next managerial appointment.

Sam Allardyce has held talks with the FA about replacing Roy Hodgson, who quit after England exited Euro 2016 in the last 16 to Iceland.
Gerrard, capped 114 times, said that pressure from the media created "huge fear" among the players.
But the 36-year-old insisted "it won't be long before fans are smiling again".
Sunderland manager Allardyce is favourite for the role, with Hull City saying on Thursday no approach has been made for another rumoured candidate, Steve Bruce.
Allardyce, 61, has not returned to the club's training camp in Austria after talks on Tuesday, but is said to be working on transfers from his desk.
United States head coach Jurgen Klinsmann and Bournemouth boss Eddie Howe have also been linked with the post.
Regardless of who gets the job, ex-Liverpool captain Gerrard - now at LA Galaxy - has "every confidence" that the national team can take it "to the next level".
He told Laduma: "The FA and the players and the new staff coming in will get it right. It will improve and it won't be too long before the fans are smiling again.
"This experience and this hurt will help all of those players moving forward because they won't want to experience it again.
"There's a huge fear amongst the group at the moment. The expectations are very, very high. But they will be used to it in years to come."
