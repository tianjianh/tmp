Since taking charge in 1999, the 61-year-old has led Britain to four successive Olympic team medals, as well as five European team titles.
"His knowledge, experience and advice will be sorely missed," said British Equestrian Federation performance director Dan Hughes.
The BEF will start the search for a new performance manager later this year.
Breisner said: "Having decided after London 2012 that I would step down as eventing performance manager following the Rio 2016 Olympics, now is the time to start the process of appointing my successor.
"However, my full concentration and focus remains on our preparations for Rio."
