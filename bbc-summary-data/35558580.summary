Some lifelong supporters missed out when UEFA allocated the tickets on Tuesday.
About 800 extra tickets were later made available. Now more than 400 more have been added.
However, there is no sign yet of  more tickets for Northern Ireland's matches against Germany and the Ukraine.
On Wednesday, the Irish Football Association (IFA) announced a portal would be created for Northern Ireland supporters to apply for extra tickets.
The portal, for the match against Poland, is open to supporters on a priority list who were were informed they had missed out on Tuesday.
Northern Ireland are  to play Poland, Ukraine and Germany in France in June.
The Football Association of Ireland (FAI) announced on Friday that 832 extra tickets had been released by UEFA for Republic of Ireland fans.
FAI chief executive John Delaney said: "We are continually in talks and correspondence with UEFA for more tickets, and this policy has proven successful up to now.
"There are still 2,000 extra tickets which we will draw on to try and satisfy those who have missed out on the current process.
"I'd like to thank UEFA for its work so far in freeing up more tickets, but we, of course, would like more.
"Republic of Ireland supporters will represent one of the biggest groups of supporters at EURO 2016, and accordingly we have a huge fan base to try to satisfy."
