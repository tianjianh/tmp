England manager Roy Hodgson says he wanted to invite Jack Grealish to train with the national team but was blocked by Aston Villa boss Tim Sherwood.

Villa midfielder Grealish, 20, has chosen to represent England rather than Republic of Ireland but must wait for international clearance to play.
"We wanted to induct him into the England way," Hodgson told BBC Sport.
"Tim made it clear it wasn't a good idea as far as he was concerned because he is behind after missing pre-season."
Hodgson said he had "no problem" with Sherwood's view.
Grealish represented the Republic at under-21 level but turned down a call-up to their senior squad for a friendly against England in June.
The Birmingham-born player qualifies for the Republic through his grandparents.
Hodgson added on BBC Radio 5 live: "The Football Association wanted him to come up to show that they were pleased that he had chosen England.
"We often have young players training with us when we are up there. It wouldn't have been a problem.
"But the thing he has to do now of course is to make certain through his performances for Aston Villa that he merits selection. Hopefully when November comes around he will be available."
England have already qualified for Euro 2016 before their final two group games - against Estonia at Wembley on 9 October and in Lithuania three days later.
