Hungry Jack's: Corpse lay undiscovered in Australian fast food outlet toilet for days

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The authorities in Western Australia are trying to determine how a man's dead body went unnoticed for nearly three days in the toilet of a fast food outlet in a suburb of Perth.

It is thought the man died from a drugs overdose, and the death is not being treated as suspicious.
Customers at the store have expressed concern about hygiene standards.
Hungry Jack's, the Australian franchise of Burger King, said they were co-operating with the authorities.
When contacted by the Australian news broadcaster ABC, Hungry Jack's head office did not address questions relating to the cleaning schedule of the bathrooms, but issued a short, unattributed statement.
"Hungry Jack's is co-operating with all relevant authorities regarding the matter at its restaurant in Balga, Western Australia," the statement said.  "Our thoughts are with all concerned."
The man, believed to have entered on Friday night, was found on Monday morning. The store was reported to have been open at the weekend.
Customers said they were concerned the toilets had apparently not been checked for three days.
"It's unfortunate, and you have to worry about... how often they check their facilities," customer Felix Davis told ABC.
"Three days is a pretty long time, poor guy."
It is understood the toilet cubicle had a floor to ceiling door with a single vent.
