Wrexham striker James Gray has resumed full training following a month on the sidelines after he was bitten by a false widow spider.

Gray was at home when he was bitten on his right arm, but thought nothing of the spot which appeared.
But the 23-year-old had to have surgery after a bite by Britain's most venomous spider left him with a gaping hole in his arm.
"At first it [appeared] a harmless sort of spot you would get," Gray said.

Gray also believed he was feeling run down because of training and travel commitments with the National League side.
"I didn't think anything of it until the following Tuesday when I went to see the club doctor," Gray told BBC Radio Wales' Jason Mohammad programme.
"Then it got worse and worse and I think that's when the doctor realised the infection was spreading to my upper arm and my whole arm was flaring up and getting red.
"That's when it got quite serious and I got rushed into hospital."
Gray, who joined Wrexham in June 2015 following his release by Accrington Stanley, was admitted to Wrexham's Maelor Hospital.
He had surgery to cut out the infection and was put on an IV drip before he was released two days later.
"They cut the infection out of my arm and that why I had the hole in my arm," Gray added.
"When I got out of theatre they said it was a spider bite. I had to keep going back to the clinic to get it packed so it would heal the correct way.
"Because I was getting it wrapped up and protected, that's why I couldn't have any contact with other players. The doctors frowned upon me sweating as well because the infection could come up again but I'm back now.
"The lads had a bit of a joke about it. I've been called Spiderman and all sorts."
Wrexham host cross-border rivals Chester in the National League on Saturday, 19 March.
