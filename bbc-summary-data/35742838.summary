About 20 houses were evacuated at 17:00 GMT on Sunday after the discovery of a suspicious object.
Residents were allowed back into their homes four hours later. Army bomb experts are now examining the object.
Police do not believe the motive was sectarian nor is it being linked to recent attacks in other parts of Northern Ireland.
The SDLP MLA, Gerard Diver, said he understood the device to be a pipe bomb. He described the incident as "disgusting".
"Clearly, whoever put this device (there) had no regard for the safety and well being of the people of Gelvin Gardens," said Mr Diver.
"These are lethal devices. This is a device that could kill people very easily or maim people.
"It's disgusting, repugnant and something I think this entire community rejects."
Speaking during the alert on Sunday evening, community worker Geraldine Doherty said people were very angry.
"The anger is palpable," she said.
"You have to condemn attacks like this at all times."
