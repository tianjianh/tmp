Police in India say they have no evidence to charge Amnesty International with sedition after some people allegedly raised "anti-India" slogans at its event recently.

Amnesty said its event in Bangalore aimed "to seek justice for human rights violations" in Kashmir.
But a right-wing student group said the event was "anti-national" and filed a complaint.
In February, two students were arrested in Delhi on sedition charges.
Reports said some Kashmiri students started raising "anti-India" slogans after a participant praised the Indian army at the event in Bangalore.
The police said it had examined unedited video footage of the meeting held on 13 August where a few participants allegedly chanted the slogans.
"As things stand now, we can say prima facie that no charge of sedition can be made out against Amnesty International India. We can say that we are not getting substantive evidence to prove that charge," senior police official Charan Reddy told BBC Hindi.
He said there was "some slogan shouting regarding freedom from India and we have identified some people".
"We will be questioning those people. We need to await the translation by experts of the proceedings of the meeting," Mr Reddy said.
More than 60 people have been killed and more than 5,000 injured in Indian-administered Kashmir in recent weeks as protesters have repeatedly clashed with the security forces.
The recent upsurge in violence has been triggered by the killing of militant leader Burhan Wani.
Disputed Kashmir is claimed in its entirety by both India and Pakistan and has been a flashpoint for more than 60 years, sparking two wars between the neighbours.
Within the Muslim-majority territory, some militant groups have taken up arms to fight for independence from Indian rule or a merger with Pakistan.
