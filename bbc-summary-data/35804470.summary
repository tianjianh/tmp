Port workers at Grangemouth begin two-week strike

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A two-week strike has begun at Scotland's largest container port in a dispute over shift patterns.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The union Unite called the strike after members based at the Port of Grangemouth voted overwhelmingly for industrial action.
The union claims new rotas being introduced by port owners Forth Ports amount to a "de facto pay cut".
Forth Ports  called the strike "unjustified" and said the changes reflected the needs of customers.
The strike action is due to run until 00:01 on Tuesday 29 March, after which a complete ban on overtime is due to start.
The strike involves operatives such as crane drivers and loaders.
Ahead of the start of the action, Unite regional officer Sandy Smart said: "We are on the verge of a prolonged strike action at Scotland's biggest port because of Forth Ports' draconian approach to employment relations.
"The basics of good relations are consultation and negotiation but Forth Ports completely ignored this to impose a range of measures that will cause significant financial detriment to their employees."
The Port of Grangemouth handles more than 150,000 containers annually, with daily sailings to Rotterdam, Antwerp, Felixstowe and Hamburg.
