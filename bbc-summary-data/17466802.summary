Plans for a cull of 200 Canada Geese on Windermere have been shelved.

The Windermere Geese Management Group (WGMG) said the birds had been causing environmental problems on the lake and other control measures had failed.
However, after concerns were raised by members of the public and the RSPCA, the group has now decided to put the plans on hold.
Neil Ryding, who organised a signed petition against the cull, said he was "absolutely delighted" with the news.
When the group announced the plan for the cull last month, it said it would be carried out "professionally, quickly and humanely".
However, on Monday, RSPCA chief executive Gavin Grant said there were alternative solutions and warned if the cull was not carried out lawfully it would consider prosecution.
Mr Grant said such a cull would be a "bloody stain" on Windermere.
Following the RSPCA's comments, wildlife experts submitted a proposal to the group recommending a 12 month moratorium.
The proposal argued that much more could be achieved with regards to both the resident and migratory element of the population.
At a meeting on Tuesday, The Windermere Geese Management Group decided to "defer" the proposed cull, allowing them to "fully explore newly presented options which have recently emerged".
While culling remains an option, the group intends to meet with the organisations and individuals in the near future to discuss alternative approaches to management.
Non-lethal control measures will continue to be used during 2012.
Mr Ryding said: "I am absolutely delighted with the brilliant news.
"It seems they have finally listened to the reason that was being put to them.
"So many people have worked so hard on this and when I started the petition originally I never dreamed so many people would be on board in such a short space of time. It's fantastic news."
