Groove Loch Ness, a one-day one-stage festival for 18s and over, will be held in a field at Dores on the shore of the loch near Inverness on Saturday.
Groove Armada, 2 Many DJs, Eli & Fur and Radio 1 DJ B Traits will be performing.
RockNess, which drew up to 35,000 people, has not been held since 2013.
Groove Loch Ness has been organised in just eight months by four people working in the music industry in Scotland.
Caroline Campbell is director of the Ironworks venue in Inverness, while Dougie Brown, Sam Barker and Joe Gibbs are involved in the running of the Belladrum Tartan Heart Festival near Beauly. Mr Gibbs was a co-founder of RockNess.
The stage for Groove has been custom-built by Highlands-based firm MacDonald Scaffolding, which normally receives contracts from the construction industry.
Banners decorated with the festival's logo will be draped around the scaffolding during the day.
After dark, the banners will be dropped to reveal a white covering on to which images will be projected while the DJs and other acts perform.
Mr Brown said: "We can't wait to welcome everyone to our first outing of Groove Festival.
"The site is looking incredible and when darkness descends on the loch and the full visual show comes to life it is going to feel like the best nightclub ever under the stars."
RockNess was one of Scotland's biggest music festivals and grew from a one day to a three day event.
Its organisers cancelled 2014's event after failing to find dates that did not clash with the World Cup and the Commonwealth Games.
The cancellation of this year's festival was announced in January.
Before 2014, the event had been held at Dores, every June since 2006.
A festival for truck and vintage lorry enthusiasts has been held on the site since 2013, but Groove would be the first music event.
