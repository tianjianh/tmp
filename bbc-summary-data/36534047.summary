The body of Ian Goodall, 54, was discovered at a property in Minto Cresent at 09:40 on Saturday.
A 25-year-old man appeared in court on Monday charged with murder.
Mr Goodall's relatives have urged anyone who can help police with their inquiries to get in touch.
In a statement, they said: "We are devastated by the sudden loss of Ian who was a loving father, grandfather and brother.
"We will miss him and didn't expect him to be taken from us so soon."
Det Insp Stuart Wilson, of Police Scotland's major investigation team, said: "An investigation is still ongoing to establish the full circumstances leading up to Ian's death.
"We're appealing for those with any information that may help with our inquiries to contact us."
