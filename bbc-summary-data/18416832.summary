Pembrokeshire council leader's child protection meeting in 'padded room' row

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The leader of Pembrokeshire council is to meet ministers to discuss a final warning after the authority was accused of failing to safeguard children.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
There are complaints about children with behaviour problems being locked in padded "time out rooms".
On Tuesday the Welsh government said it was "gravely concerned" and has threatened to force the council to comply with its duty.
Ministers say progress has been "worryingly slow".
Council leader Jamie Adams said the warning's timing was perplexing as he had been due to meet ministers on Wednesday.
A panel of experts was sent into the authority last year after a report into child abuse allegations.
Ministers are considering giving the board the power to issue instructions so the authority meets its safeguarding duties.
In a letter to the council's leader on Tuesday they said they continue to be very concerned about the authority.
Their letter says despite an initial investigation and police recommendations, no disciplinary investigation has been carried out into complaints about the small padded "time out room" at a unit for children with special educational needs and behaviour problems.
Ministers say they have since heard about at least five rooms at schools in the county in which children were locked "and there may be several more".
There are separate allegations about a boy at another infant school having his hands tied behind his back.
In a joint statement, Education Minister Leighton Andrews and Deputy Social Services Minister Gwenda Thomas said: "We have waited long enough and we are not prepared to give another warning."
Jamie Adams, the council's independent leader, said he was "perplexed" by the timing of their statement as he had a long-standing appointment to meet ministers on Wednesday.
He said he was also "surprised at the content of this letter" as there had been "positive discussions" with the ministerial board since local elections in May.
"As elected members, we will support staff so that we continue to take all steps to meet the expectations of ministers and, most importantly, the children of this county who continue to be our primary concern," he said.
He has been given a deadline of 17:00 BST on 22 June to respond before ministers decide what action to take.
Sue Perkins, the council's cabinet member for safeguarding and children's services, said: "In my short time as cabinet member I feel we have made strides forward.
"I am sure that following tomorrow's meeting, the ministers will be reassured about the progress that has been made and will agree that safeguarding is top of the Pembrokeshire county council agenda."
Des Mannion is the NSPCC's national head of service in Wales said: "There seems to be emerging concerns and emerging new pieces of information, all cumulatively concerning.
"There does seem to be something systematic. There seems to be a failure that's running through the local authority."
He added: "Irrespective of the policies, we have to remember there are children involved in all of this. All children need to be protected."
Paul Davies AM for Preseli Pembrokeshire said it was important that Pembrokeshire council responds "positively" to addressing some of the failing identified.
He added: "What is important now is that we need to see proper mechanisms in place, we need to see a proper framework in place.
"I think we need to see proper reporting in place that is confident in achieving what we all want to see and that is the protection of our children in Pembrokeshire.
"I've made it quite clear that I support the Welsh government in scrutinising this very serious situation.
"I hope it doesn't come to the Welsh government needing to intervene in this matter and I hope that Pembrokeshire county council and the Welsh government now work together from today onwards to address some of these failings."
Simon Thomas Plaid Cymru's education spokesman at the assembly, says there should be "sweeping changes" in the culture of the council's childrens' department.
He does not believe the council should be given "another day" to put their house in order.
