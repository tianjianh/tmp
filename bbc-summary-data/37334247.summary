Francesco Totti: Roma legend scores late winner against Sampdoria in rain-hit Rome

Club legend Francesco Totti scored a late winner on his first appearance of the season as Roma beat the weather and Sampdoria to secure a 3-2 victory.

The start of the second half of the match at Roma's Olympic Stadium was delayed due to a saturated pitch.
Sampdoria led 2-1 at the time but following the resumption Roma scored twice, including Totti's 90th-minute penalty to stay unbeaten in Serie A.
Totti, 39, has now scored in 23 consecutive Serie A seasons for Roma.
Sampdoria had won their first three games of the season and hit back after Mohamed Salah's early goal for Roma to lead through goals from Luis Muriel and Fabio Quagliarella.
But former Manchester City striker Edin Dzeko made it 2-2 after 61 minutes before fellow substitute Totti secured victory from the penalty spot with his 249th goal in Serie A after Dzeko had been fouled.
"That was the first time I've ever felt afraid of taking a penalty.  You just can't afford to miss under the Curva," Totti told Sky Sports, with reference to the popular Curva Sud end at Roma's home ground.
Totti has started what is expected to be the 25th and final year of his career at Roma, where the former Italy international is the club's record appearance maker with 759 games and highest goalscorer with a total of 305 in all competitions.
Elsewhere, inclement weather also affected Genoa's match against Fiorentina, which was abandoned after 28 minutes when the surface became unplayable.
