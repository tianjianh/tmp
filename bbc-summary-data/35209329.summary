The boys, aged six and 10, were taken from Hemming Way on the Britwell estate at around 07:00 GMT on New Year's Eve.
The pair were ordered into a white van and driven around for several minutes.
Two people, possibly an adult and a child, seen walking in the area near the time of the kidnap are being asked to contact police.
Police said the boys were later allowed out of the van and were able to run back home uninjured.
