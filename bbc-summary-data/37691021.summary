The lives of some of Britain's military families have been captured on camera to show the experiences of children who have a parent serving away from home.

The charity Little Troopers estimates there are more than 150,000 children who have a parent serving in the British armed forces who may be away from home for up to nine months.
Louise Fetigan, the charity's founder, said: "The pictures show many of the emotions experienced by a military family from waving goodbye to Daddy's ship, the happiness when they come home and the tough times while they are away."
The images are being used in a charity calendar and include families from the Army, Royal Navy and RAF. The charity says its Military Moments calendar shows a side of forces life very rarely shared.
The BBC has gathered some of the most beautiful and interesting photographs from across England on its Pinterest board.
