The 19-year-old has played one first-team game for the Lions since joining them from Irish club Bohemians in July.
"He's a player I came across when on a scouting mission a few weeks ago," Torquay player-manager Kevin Nicholson said. "It's a great opportunity for him to come and test himself."
Rooney could make his Gulls debut in Saturday's FA Trophy tie at Braintree.
