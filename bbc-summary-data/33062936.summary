One man is said to be in a serious condition.
A man has been arrested and is being questioned by police.
Paul Reynolds, a reporter for Irish state broadcaster RTÉ, said:
"Gardaí [Irish police] are still trying to establish the facts, but it appears that, just before 4am, on Tuesday morning, a large number of people got into a fight on Kennelsfort Road.
"Weapons were used and a number of people were injured.
"It is understood this may have been a fight among members of the Travelling community."
