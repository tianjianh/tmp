They were on their way from Norway to the Carribbean when they experienced problems at about 23:30 BST on Friday.
Their 20ft (6m) yacht was headed for Belfast when they raised the alarm after the engine failed.
Larne RNLI brought the women and their yacht to safety at Larne harbour.
Coxswain Norman Surplus said: "The three women did the right thing and raised the alarm when they got into difficulty.
"Thankfully, all three are safe and well and we would like to wish them a safe onward journey.
'We would encourage anyone visiting the coast this summer to remember to respect the water," he added.
"When sailing, always have a means for calling and signalling for help and ensure everyone onboard knows how to use it. Always check the weather forecast and tide times.
"Make sure someone ashore knows where you are going and who to call if you don't return on time. Learn how to start, run and maintain your engine and always carry tools and spares."
