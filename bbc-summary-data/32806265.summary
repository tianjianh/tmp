[SN]TITLE[SN]
Council supports listing of Danske Bank and Belfast Telegraph buildings

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Belfast City Council has voted to support the listing of Danske Bank's headquarters and part of the Belfast Telegraph's building.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Northern Ireland Environment Agency (NIEA) is proposing to give both buildings a B listing.
This recognises them as having local importance or being good examples of a period style.
It had asked the council's planning committee to give its opinion on the proposals.
The committee voted to support the listing of Danske's building and the oldest parts of the Telegraph's building.
The final decision on the listing will now be taken by the NIEA.
Danske Bank's building on Donegall Square was constructed in 1972 to a design by architects BDP.
The NIEA assessment described it as "a bold exercise in 20th century modernism" and "one of the strongest expressions of 1970s architecture in Belfast".
The Belfast Telegraph building on Royal Avenue dates from 1886 and was designed by Henry Seaver.
The NIEA said the building was among Seaver's first works and retains "much historic fabric and detailing".
Both Danske and the Belfast Telegraph had raised concerns about the proposed listings saying they had the potential to  impose "unnecessary constraints" on their operations.
