Newspaper review: Egypt coup mulled

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The ousting of President Mohammed Morsi in Egypt is the lead for the Times, the Daily Telegraph, the Guardian and the Financial Times.

The Guardian has the headline: "Egypt's second revolution."
It says large numbers of Egyptians who, after the fall of Hosni Mubarak, saw the military as a roadblock to democracy, are now casting the army as its champion.
But the Times says even those desperate to see the back of Mr Morsi's Muslim Brotherhood are wary about the precedent of removing a democratically-elected government.
The Financial Times says the intervention sweeps aside two parliamentary elections, two constitutional referendums and a presidential election.
The Daily Mail leads with a Home Office report that, it says, lays bare the full impact of mass immigration on British life.
It reports that the study found half the population lived in a town or city that had experienced high levels of immigration over the past decade,
This "uncontrolled" flow, the paper goes on, had caused a number of problems for wider society.
They ranged from pressure on maternity services, high rates of infectious diseases and a squeeze on school places, to disproportionate levels of some types of crime, inflated rents and immigrants living in "beds in sheds".
The Financial Times has called on the government to cut its losses and abandon "Britain's white elephant" - the HS2 rail scheme.
"The economic justification for this multi-billion pound train set has always been flimsy at best," it says.
It adds that numbers have been "massaged" in a way "that magnified the benefits out of proportion to the reality".
And it thinks Britain would be better off financing smaller transport improvements "that offer fewer good news headlines but more value for money" - including an upgrade of the west coast line.
There is plenty of interest in the Belgian king's decision to abdicate.
The Telegraph says Albert II is known to be unwell and exhausted after a difficult five years for Belgium where deep divisions between its Flemish (Dutch-speaking) north and French-speaking south have pushed the country to the brink of break-up.
The paper adds that the king has faced a number of royal scandals that have damaged the standing of the monarchy, including a current court case brought by a 45-year-old artist alleging she is his illegitimate daughter.
Andy Murray's nail-biting victory in the quarter finals at Wimbledon brings a collective sigh of relief.
He came back from the dead, the Independent says.
The Mail found his struggle with Fernando Verdasco sheer torture.
The Daily Mirror says he sent the country into a nervous meltdown.
The Telegraph congratulates Murray but adds: "Please don't put us through that again."
The Times, which has a picture of Murray venting his frustration at one point during the match, sympathises: "We felt your pain too, Andy."
