Corrie Mckeague, 23, based at RAF Honington in Suffolk, vanished after a night out in Bury St Edumunds two weeks ago.
Suffolk Police said it had identified three young people they had been looking for.
The force said they were being spoken to as potential witnesses.

CCTV showed they had been in the town centre when Mr Mckeague, originally from Dunfermline in Fife, went missing on 24 September.
Footage revealed the area was "comparatively busy" between 3am and 6am and the force wants to speak to anyone who was there during that time period.
Officers have carried out further checks in the Brentgovel Street and Short Brackland area over the weekend and spoken to a number of people to identify possible new lines of inquiry.
Mr Mckeague was wearing distinctive light clothing - a pink shirt and white jeans or trousers - when he was last seen on CCTV walking alone and eating fast food at 03:20 BST.
It is thought he stopped for a brief nap in a doorway before setting off to walk the nine miles (15km) back to the RAF base alone.
