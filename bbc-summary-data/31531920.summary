[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A ball that disappeared in the middle of Royal Shrovetide Football, bringing the game to a confused end, has been discovered lodged in a hedge.

The annual game is played between Up'ards and Down'ards in Ashbourne, Derbyshire, over two days.
This year, the Up'ards took the honours on Tuesday but Wednesday's game ended when the ball was lost in Mayfield.
Some suspected foul play but organisers said it was an "ill-fated attempt" to launch the ball towards goal.
Shrovetide committee member Mike Betteridge, who turned up the ball on Wednesday, said: "There was frantic searching for nearly an hour before a group of Up'ards found it.
"It had lodged itself in the upper branches of the hedge, which was a leylandii, and no-one could see it."
Because nobody goaled the ball, Mr Betteridge gets to keep it.
