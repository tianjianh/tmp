The Scottish government will be given almost £4m to help households and businesses affected by last weekend's flooding, it has been announced.

It is part of a £50m UK-wide fund announced by Chancellor George Osborne.
Communities in the Borders, Dumfries and Galloway, Tayside and Moray were among those hit by Storm Desmond.
Scottish Secretary David Mundell said Scotland would receive £3.94m, under the terms of the Barnett formula.
He added: "The chancellor is absolutely right to provide financial help to those affected by the terrible flooding in England.
"In the UK we share risks and resources in a way that means Scotland will now also receive extra money from the Treasury.
"People in Scotland who had their homes flooded in the past week will expect the Scottish government to use this new money to help them in the same way the UK government is helping those south of the border.
"I hope the Scottish government will confirm that this is what they plan to do.'
About 600 people were evacuated from their homes in Hawick as the River Teviot burst its banks on Saturday.
Peebles, Selkirk, Coldstream, Jedburgh and Kelso were also affected.
The Met Office said that about 100mm of rain fell in the area throughout Friday and Saturday.
In Dumfries, businesses were flooded when the River Nith flowed on to the Whitesands.
The effects of the storm were also felt in Newcastleton, Langholm, and in Annandale and Eskdale.
