Police Scotland said it was consulting on a move there from the current base on Merchant Street.
It said it was part of a wider review into the police estate, which was launched last year.
A spokesperson confirmed: "Police Scotland is in discussion with various partner agencies in relation to the relocation of the police office."
The statement added: "These discussions form part of a wider estates strategy and are in the early stages of consultation.
"We continue to assess the best options for our accommodation needs within the Peterhead community, to meet the needs of the community.
"It's important we capture the views of the local community and those affected by any potential relocation of the police office and when we reach the point of agreement this will be shared publicly."
