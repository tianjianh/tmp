What it's like to be in a boy band, by former star

The gruelling schedule the One Direction boys have been put through are no secret.

It was highlighted when Zayn Malik left the Asian leg of the band's On the Road Again tour last week and was signed off with stress.
But Newsbeat wanted to know what life in a boy band is really like.
So we spoke to Scott Robinson from 1990s band Five, who left the group when he was just about to turn 22. Here is his story in his own words.
It is very difficult being in a boy band.
What it is, is people from the public just see the glamour side of it and obviously they see you doing the big shows and Top of the Pops on the telly and living a certain lifestyle.
They think it's amazing. And it is, but you're worked very, very hard. It is tricky and you get very tired.
So, for example, during a week, we could be starting off in London. We might be on the Big Breakfast Show, say for six in the morning. So we'd be picked up at four in the morning or maybe earlier.
We'd go straight into make-up, we'd go on the show. We would literally finish the Big Breakfast and we could be jetting off to America. And we could be in America for two days doing promo.
Then we could leave America after two days and go to, anywhere, Norway, Sweden, anywhere. It could be writing, it could be recording, it could have been touring.
It was non-stop and we didn't get any breaks.
I remember sometimes we'd set an alarm and you'd be given two hours kip and then we were up doing another round of promo or whatever.
Speaking to the manager of One Direction, who used to work at the record company that we did, he said that they're worked pretty much the same, although they are given scheduled breaks.
They will have a certain amount of time to relax. But in that relaxation time, obviously you can't go anywhere, so you're still very much in the bubble of One Direction or Five.
You never really get any time to yourself. I remember having to call off the end of a tour because we were just so tired.
I'm a really fussy eater, so I could never find anything to eat, ever, anywhere.
I remember there were four days left in our world tour and we said, 'Look, we just can't do it' and we were all very, very unwell because we'd been worked so hard.
I had four days off, and that was the longest I ever remember having off during the band.
When I got to America, my now wife and mum and dad looked at me, and said, 'Wow, you look so ill'.
I slept for the first three days of the holiday. I hadn't eaten properly, I was very skinny. It was horrible to be in the situation where you are that tired.
You had to be happy all day long. There were points where you were so incredibly tired you almost didn't know your own mind.
You would be interviewed and you were being asked exactly the same question again and again and you've got to be enthusiastic about that question.
I used to fall asleep in the make-up chair. I used to go to sleep in the make-up chair, for 10 minutes and I'd wake up looking like a pop star. But I promise you I didn't look like a pop star before I sat in the chair.
It was literally 24/7 and that's no exaggeration and I do genuinely remember times when we had no sleep. Like, you know, none. None whatsoever.
Five are back on tour from 16 April.
