After last year's powerful coverage that saw Ellie Goulding admitting she'd like a wheel for a foot, you'll be glad to hear Dan and Phil are returning to present coverage at this year's Brits.

The Radio 1 presenters will host a YouTube stream from the red carpet at the event at the O2 next month.
They'll also be hosting a series of videos backstage at the nominations event on 15 January.
Jessie Ware, Clean Bandit and FKA Twigs will perform on the night.
Critics' Choice winner James Bay will also play at The Brits Are Coming, which will be filmed on the night before airing on ITV at 22:40 GMT.
The main coverage of the launch night will be hosted by Reggie Yates.
The 2015 Brit awards, which will include performances from Ed Sheeran, Sam Smith and Taylor Swift, will take place on 25 February.
Having hosted the event between 2011 and 2014, James Corden will be replaced by duo Ant and Dec.
It's 14 years since the last time the duo presented the ceremony.
