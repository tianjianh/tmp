[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Galatasaray have signed striker Bafetimbi Gomis from Swansea City for an undisclosed fee.

The 31-year-old France international spent last season on loan at Marseille.
Gomis scored 21 goals in 33 games for the French club and they were keen to keep him, but he has opted for Turkey.
"I have a lot of friends from Turkey, and also [Didier] Drogba and [Aurelien] Chedjou have told me that the best team in Turkey is Galatasaray," Gomis told the Galatasaray official website.
The move is subject to international clearance.
Gomis joined Swansea on a four-year contract from Lyon in 2014 as back-up to former Swans striker Wilfried Bony and the Frenchman scored 10 goals in his first campaign, including five in his last six games.
But his scoring rate dropped and after 17 goals in 71 games, Gomis was loaned to Ligue 1 side Marseilles last summer.
