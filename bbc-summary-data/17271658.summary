Profile: Rahul Gandhi

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Rahul Gandhi, heir of the powerful Nehru-Gandhi political dynasty that has dominated Indian politics for decades, has accepted responsibility for the party's worst ever election performance.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Appointed second-in-command of Congress in January 2013, Mr Gandhi led the party into the general election and managed its campaign.
He criss-crossed the length and breadth of India, addressing election rallies and holding meetings with party workers and supporters.
But the race was extremely tough for him - Congress bore the brunt of voter unhappiness over a slowing economy, high inflation and a string of damaging corruption scandals.
Mr Gandhi has long been seen as a prime-minister-in-waiting but with the charismatic and populist BJP candidate Narendra Modi having declared his hand, Congress refrained from naming Mr Gandhi as their prime ministerial candidate.
Analysts said the move was aimed at protecting one of the party's main assets ahead of the drubbing the party received.
Many in the party ranks had long clamoured for a bigger role for Mr Gandhi.
But there had also been questions about how eager he was to embrace this role. Critics have often described him as the "reluctant prince" who has been the de facto number two for a long time, wielding the power, but shying away from responsibility.
Also, his campaigning in last year's crucial state elections failed to deliver the votes, raising further questions about his leadership abilities.
In his only television interview earlier this year Mr Gandhi gave the impression he was leading the party because his birth gave him no choice, rather than because of any ambition.
The son of murdered former prime minister Rajiv Gandhi and his Italian-born widow Sonia, Rahul has been steadily building up his own political profile as he strives to emerge from his parents' shadow.
He was born on 19 June 1970 and went to the finest Indian schools, going on to study economics in the US and work in London before returning to work in Mumbai in 2002.
Rahul was seen as a shy man whose interests lay more in cricket matches and the outdoors than in political life.
His charismatic and popular sister Priyanka was thought to be more likely to take over the family's mantle of power.
His decision to enter formal politics before the 2004 general election therefore took many by surprise.
That year, Mr Gandhi stood for parliament and won the traditional family constituency of Amethi in Uttar Pradesh, which his father had once held.
In September 2007 Rahul was named as the party's secretary general, with his mother Sonia remaining as president, and in January last year, he was appointed the vice-president of the party.
He represents the fourth generation of the Nehru-Gandhi dynasty that has led the Congress party, and India, for much of the time since independence from Britain in 1947.
His grandmother, Indira, was another prime minister, also assassinated, while his great-grandfather, Jawaharlal Nehru, was independent India's first leader.
Why Rahul, rather than Priyanka, answered the party's call for a new generation of Gandhis is still not fully clear.
Many within the Congress party saw his move into politics as positive, although the decision was seen by some as highlighting the party's lack of alternatives and its continuing reliance on the Nehru-Gandhi family for leadership and direction.
Whatever the concerns, expectations were high that he would play a major role in the government and the party. Despite his "dark horse" image, he is said by some analysts to have a detailed political knowledge and to be a practised backroom operator.
Although he turned down previous roles to take a prominent role in the party, by 2008 he had kicked off a campaign called the "discovery of India", aimed at winning over hearts and minds and projecting himself as a future leader.
In his campaigning in Uttar Pradesh in the 2012 state elections, he addressed more than 200 rallies, slept in villagers' huts and even grew stubble to give himself more of a "man of the people" look.
