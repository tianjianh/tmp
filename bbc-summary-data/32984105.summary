Lt Jenkins, from Colwyn Bay, Conwy, collapsed at the Commando Training Centre, Lympstone, Devon, while on a 30-mile (48km) march on Thursday.
An investigation into his death is being carried out.
A Royal Navy spokesman said: "The thoughts and sympathies of the naval service are with his family and friends at this time."
Lt Jenkins, who was in his mid-20s, died during the so-called "30-miler" march, the last major test undertaken as part of the 32-week Commando course.
Trainees must complete it carrying at least 32lbs (15kg) of equipment in a maximum time of eight hours.
