Conservatives promise 'dignity and security' in old age

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Elderly people would have "dignity and security" under Welsh Conservative rule, leader Andrew RT Davies has told his party conference in Llangollen.

Mr Davies outlined plans to cap the cost of residential care and allow people to keep more of their assets if they move into a care home.
His was the only party to rule out propping up another Labour government after May's assembly election, he said.
Later, David Cameron told party members that Wales could be a "powerhouse".
Describing the assembly poll as "the most important in a generation", Mr Davies made repeated references to Labour's UK leader Jeremy Corbyn, saying the party wanted to "take a trip down memory lane to the 1970s".
Mr Davies said the 2015 general election result - when the Tories won Gower and the Vale of Clwyd from Labour - showed there were enough Conservative votes in Wales to stop Labour keeping power in Cardiff Bay.
If they win the assembly election, the Tories say people will be able to keep £100,000 of their assets before paying to go into a care home.
The current limit is £24,000.
They would also cap the weekly cost of care at £400 - about £100 less than the current weekly average.
Mr Davies promised "a government that delivers dignity and security in old age".
He said the NHS was the party's top priority, accusing Labour of being "bad for your health".
Welsh Tories would increase spending on health over a five-year term, he said.
Under the Conservatives he promised: "No reorganisation, no hospital closures and never privatising our beloved NHS."
His speech promised that the Tories would use tax powers that are set to be devolved to the assembly to make Wales the UK's "low-tax capital".
However, there was no detail on how proposed tax cuts would be paid for.
His speech also did not mention the EU referendum on June 23 - Mr Davies has said he will vote to leave.
This was a far more structured speech from Andrew RT Davies than we have come to expect from a man who usually likes to veer off script.
As expected, the NHS was the dominant theme - he said it was the "single biggest challenge" facing Wales.
The pledge to cut income tax once it is devolved was described as a "game-changer" and a reason not to put Labour in charge.
Jeremy Corbyn was mentioned at least as many times as the first minister but on the whole I was expecting attacks on the UK Labour leader to play a far more central role.
What was new today was the pledge to cap residential care home fees at £400 a week and that people would be able to keep £100,000 of their assets before having to pay care home fees.
There was also a new tactical approach which was to stress that every vote counts - or that Labour was "only one seat away from losing control".
There was one glaring omission from the speech - not one mention of the EU referendum.
Mr Davies obviously wanted to use the speech as his platform to focus on devolved issues, but the failure to even talk about it once will leave him open to the "elephant in the room" accusation.
