The 28-year-old England international has made 193 appearances for Quins since joining them from Leeds in 2006.
"The re-signing process was done very quickly as there was never any doubt in my mind to go anywhere else," the scrum-half told the club website.
"Harlequins is a club that I love; I'm very proud and honoured to play for and captain the team."
The club have not disclosed the length of Care's new deal at the Twickenham Stoop.
Care, who has won 53 caps after making his England debut in 2008, was appointed Quins skipper this summer.
"Danny is the ultimate game-changer and has matured and grown in front of us all," Harlequins director of rugby Conor O'Shea said.
"In Danny we see the Harlequins style stamped all over the way he approaches the game.
"Captaincy is another natural progression for him and I am looking forward to watching him become an even better player."
