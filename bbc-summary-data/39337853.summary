Yellow ranger Trini, played by actress and singer Becky G, is depicted as having "girlfriend problems" in the film, according to early reviews.
Director Dean Isrealite told The Hollywood Reporter that Trini is "questioning a lot about who she is".
It comes as the live-action version of Beauty and the Beast features a gay character.
LeFou, played by Josh Gad, is seen in a brief scene described by the Disney film's director as a "gay moment".
Isrealite said of Trini's sexuality: "She hasn't fully figured it out yet. I think what's great about that scene and what that scene propels for the rest of the movie is, 'that's OK'.
"The movie is saying, 'that's OK' and all of the kids have to own who they are and find their tribe."
David Yost, who played the blue ranger in the 1990s TV series on which the film is based, told The Hollywood Reporter that "so many people in the LGBTQI community are going to be excited to see that representation".
The film version of the children's TV show is out on Friday.
