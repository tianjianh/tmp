Two songs featuring Scottish DJ Calvin Harris have missed out on the chance to become the "celebration song" of a Serie A football team.

The Dumfries record producer's hits My Way and Glows, with David Guetta, were part of the fan vote at Fiorentina.
However, supporters selected Blur's Song 2 to be played every time the team from Florence scores at home games.
The winning tune was used for the first time during Sunday night's 2-1 win over Palermo.
