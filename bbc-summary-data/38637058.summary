Trump interview quotes - and the reaction

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Donald Trump has given his first UK interview since being elected US president, speaking to Conservative MP and Times writer Michael Gove. Here are a selection key quotes, and some of the reaction to them.

"I'm a big fan of the UK, uh, we're gonna work very hard to get it done quickly and done properly - good for both sides."
Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson says: "It's great to hear that from President-elect Donald Trump. Clearly it will have to be a deal that's very much in the interest of both sides, but I have no doubt that it will be."
The Financial Times's Shawn Donnan argues that Mr Trump and Theresa May could be in for a "rude awakening", with any deal potentially taking years and some UK economic sectors, such as farming, questioning whether the terms of US-UK free trade would benefit them.
Theresa May's spokeswoman says: "We welcome the commitment to have a deal quickly and it highlights one of the opportunities of leaving the EU. We welcome the enthusiasm and energy the president-elect is showing."
"Basically [the EU is] a vehicle for Germany. That's why I thought the UK was so smart in getting out and you were there and you guys wrote it â€” put it on the front page: 'Trump said that Brexit is gonna happen'."
The Guardian's Jonathan Freedland writes that Mr Trump gave "the Brexiteers just enough to keep them happy", adding that, when asked directly about a trade deal, Mr Gove was given a "non-answer: 'I think you're doing great!'"
The Daily Telegraph says: "The comments in The Times newspaper will be a boost for Mrs May, who is preparing a major speech on Tuesday to set out her plans for Brexit."
"It's obsolete because it wasn't taking care of terror."
"And the other thing is the countries aren't paying their fair share so we're supposed to protect countries but a lot of these countries aren't paying what they're supposed to be paying, which I think is very unfair to the United States. With that being said, Nato is very important to me."
Conservative MP Michael Fabricant tweets: "#Trump is NOT anti #Nato. However, like the #UK, he believes more countries like the #UK should pay their fair whack into Nato."
German foreign minister Frank Walter Steinmeier says: "His comments have caused worry and concern even here in Brussels. I've just had a conversation with the Secretary-General of Nato, Jens Stoltenberg, who has expressed concern at the comments made by Donald Trump that Nato is obsolete. This is in contradiction with what the incoming American defence minister said in his hearing in Washington only some days ago and we have to see what will be the consequences for American policy."
Nicholas Burns, professor of the practice of diplomacy and international relations at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government, tweets: "Europe is our largest trade partner, largest investor in our economy and strongest ally-NATO. And Trump just declared it obsolete?"
"Well, I'll be there - we'll be there soon - I would say we'll be here for a little while but and it looks like she'll be here first. How is she doing over there, by the way?"
Guardian political editor Heather Stewart writes: "Michael Gove's latest excursion into controversy, pipping the prime minister - and her Foreign Secretary, Boris Johnson - to a personal meeting with Donald Trump, is just the latest in a series of headaches created for May by the powerful figures she dispatched to the back benches."
Theresa May's spokeswoman says: "We have already established good relations with the president-elect. The prime minister has spoken on the phone, her team has gone out there for discussions, the foreign secretary has had discussions." She adds: "If the British press succeeds in interviewing world leaders, we should be proud."
"Well, I start off trusting both [Vladimir Putin and Angela Merkel} - but let's see how long that lasts. It may not last long at all."
The Independent says: "President-elect Donald Trump has avoided saying who he trusts more - German Chancellor Angela Merkel, a long-time US-ally, or Russian President Vladimir Putin."
Nikolai Patrushev, secretary of Russia's Security Council, says: "If Donald Trump's administration is interested we will be ready to resume full-format consultations with our American partners through the Russian Federation's Security Council."
Angela Merkel says: "I am personally waiting for the inauguration of the US president. Then of course we will work with him on all levels."
