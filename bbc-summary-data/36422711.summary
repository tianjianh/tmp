Emirates said on Tuesday the stowaway had been found on Flight EK303 from Shanghai last Friday and had been handed over to Dubai police.
The airline did not name the stowaway but China's official Xinhua news agency said he was a 16-year-old boy named Xu.
The boy is reported to have said he was "very comfortable" in the hold.

However, he said he had eaten nothing during the nearly nine-hour flight. Gulf News said the cargo hold was pressurised.
He said he had heard that even beggars in Dubai could make a lot of money, Xinhua reported.
"We are co-operating fully with authorities in Dubai and as this is a police matter we are unable to comment further at this time," Emirates said in an emailed statement.
Xinhua said that consulate staff had been sent to the airport to learn more about the situation.
According to a translator appointed by prosecutors, the boy said he had jumped over a fence at Shanghai airport and climbed into the cargo hold while a security guard looked away, Xinhua added.
