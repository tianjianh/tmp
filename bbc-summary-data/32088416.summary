Funding for new carbon capture power station research

The Scottish and UK governments have committed more than £4m to researching a proposal for a new power station in Grangemouth.

The £4.2m of funding will help inform plans to build a 570 megawatt coal-gasification power plant using green carbon capture storage technology.
Detailed research will be carried out by Seattle-based Summit Power Group.
The Caledonia Clean Energy Project would be one of the first to integrate the green technology into the station.
Researchers will spend 18 months undertaking detailed research and feasibility studies with the ultimate objective of designing, siting, financing and building the new power plant.
The proposed facility would be the first time carbon capture technology would be combined with a coal-gasification power generator in a single facility.
Up to 90% of carbon dioxide emissions from the plant would be captured and transported through under-sea pipelines to be stored under the North Sea.
The Scottish government has contributed £2.5m to the project, while the Department of Energy and Climate Change has contributed £1.7m.
Holyrood energy minister Fergus Ewing welcomed the new study.
He said: "Carbon Capture and Storage has the potential to be one of the most cost effective technologies for decarbonisation of the UK's power and industrial sectors, as well as those of economies worldwide.
"In the power sector, CCS can contribute significantly to the diversity and security of electricity supply, and also has a unique role to play in providing a continuing supply of flexible fossil fuel capacity that is able to respond to demand in the way that other low carbon technologies are not able to.
"The Scottish government will work with the Summit Power Group with the aim to bring this cutting edge, innovative project to Scotland."
A previous plan for a carbon capture project at Longannet power plant in Fife was scrapped in 2011, while a project to install the technology at Peterhead power station is being developed.
