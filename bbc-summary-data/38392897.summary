Caroline Mckay, 33, endured 18 hours of darkness during the challenge to finish in just over 24 hours on Saturday.
The committee of the West Highland Way race, which is held in the summer, said it was the first time they had recorded a woman completing the route in winter.
The route travels from Fort William to Milngavie in Glasgow.
Miss Mckay, originally from the Isle of Mull, told the BBC Scotland news website that despite having completed several 100-mile races she was shocked at how hard the challenge had been.
She said: "It was the darkness that made this so hard. I underestimated how tough it would be.
"I have to admit I was scared when I was on my own on Rannoch Moor and would have died if I had met anyone.
"At first I kept glancing behind me but it was making me stumble as the terrain is quite stony there so I put my iPod on and played a podcast so I could hear talking to help me get through it.
"I didn't want to play music though as I thought that would take too many senses away from me when it was already hard to see. Playing a podcast meant I could still listen out for noises.
"There were big boulders too next to the trail with white markings on them, which I kept thinking were other things and I saw eyes of what turned out to be a deer at one point."
Miss Mckay said she would never do the route again and found doing it in the winter made it one of the hardest ultramarthons she has done.
She said she felt "horrendous" for the last five miles and was sick for several hours after completing the challenge.
She also ended up taking some wrong turns in the darkness due to a forestry diversion which meant she actually ran 101 miles.
She completed the official race in the summer in 19.5 hours.
Along the route she had several friends including Jamie Aarons and her boyfriend Giles Ruck running sections of the route with her.
The donor development manager was running to raise money for the African education charity she works for, Link Community Development.
Miss Mckay stopped for a few minutes at the same support points used by the West Highland Way Race, about 12 in total, just for a few minutes at each.
The longest stop was 15 minutes when she changed clothes and shoes.
On the route she ate homemade falafel, pasta, veggie burgers, oat and fruit snacks, flapjacks and a few caffeine gels near the end.
Ian Beattie, who is the race director of the West Highland Way official race in the summer and Scottish Athletics chairman, said it was an "incredible achievement".
He said: "I think we ultramarathon runners forget how hard it is to run such distances and we become quite blasÃ© but this is an incredible thing to do especially in only about six hours of daylight.
"Running in 18 hours of darkness is tough as even with a torch you don't have the perspective you would have in daylight. It is quite tough and you have to slow down.
"We believe Caroline is the first woman to have completed the West Highland Way in a oner in the winter as we don't know of anyone else that has recorded it.
"Completing challenges like this shows what is possible and resets boundaries."
