Descent into hell: Mumbai's dehumanised sewer workers

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
About 30,000 conservancy workers, also known as sweepers, are employed by the civic authorities in the Indian city of Mumbai.

The workers, all of them Dalits - formerly known as untouchables - collect garbage, sweep the city streets, clean the gutters, load and unload garbage trucks and work in the dumping grounds.
And "without exception, all of them despise their work", says photographer Sudharak Olwe who documented their lives over a period of a year.
