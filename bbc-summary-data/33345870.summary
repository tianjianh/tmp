Thirty-eight people died after a gunman opened fire on a beach in Sousse on Friday. Thirty are known to be British.
Adrian Evans, 44, a council worker from Tipton, died along with his 78-year-old father Patrick and nephew Joel Richards, 19, from Wednesbury.
Joel's brother Owen, 16, survived the attack.
In a statement, their family said they had been left "heartbroken and devastated" and would "never get over losing them".
Joel and Owen's mother Suzanne Richards said the "jolly boys' outing" to Tunisia had been arranged to celebrate Joel finishing his second year at the University of Worcester and Owen completing his GCSEs.
"Their holiday lasted less than 24 hours and their futures and lives ended tragically," she said.
She described her brother Adrian and father Patrick as "our rocks".
"They were so close that even in those minutes of pure panic the four of them stayed together.
"We would like to say how overwhelmed we are with everyone's tributes, flowers, cards and generosity. They were pure diamonds and will never be forgotten.
"As a nation we must fight this evil together and smile for Joel, Ade and Pat."
