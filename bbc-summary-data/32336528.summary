The first Duke of Wellington's handwritten orders from the conflict will also be featured in two exhibitions at Wellington Arch, at Hyde Park Corner, and nearby Apsley House.
British and Prussian forces defeated the French emperor Napoleon Bonaparte during the battle on 18 June 1815.
English Heritage said the events would explore the battle's significance.
Josephine Oxley, keeper of the Wellington collection, said visitors to the exhibitions, which open on Saturday, would be able to find out about the man behind the battle.
She said: "We've brought together a fascinating collection of surviving objects from the 19th century's most important battle, the 'Great War' of its age."
At Apsley House, which was the London home of the first Duke of Wellington, visitors will be able to see the Waterloo Gallery with a table laid out as it was when the duke hosted annual banquets to commemorate the battle.
Visitors will get an insight into the world depicted in a painting by William Salter of one of the feasts, which hangs in the property.
The first Duke of Wellington commanded the allied army in the Battle of Waterloo in what is now modern day Belgium.
At Wellington Arch, which was built to mark Wellington's victories over Napoleon, a new exhibition will feature a pair of original boots, made for the duke to give added protection in battle, his sword and handwritten notes on velum giving instructions on the conduct of the battle.
