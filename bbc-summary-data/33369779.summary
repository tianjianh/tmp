It is part of a research project run by campaigning charity WWF and local organisations.
The charity says the turtle was followed during the filming and the camera collected at the end. It says the animal was not harmed in any way.
It says hundreds of turtles have been found dead near the reef over the last four years, and it hopes the project may help find out why.
