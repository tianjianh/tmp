One-Day Cup: Durham out of competition after Lancashire game washed out

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Durham were eliminated from the One-Day Cup after their match against Lancashire was abandoned and other results went against them.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
In a match reduced to 17 overs per side at Old Trafford, only seven were possible with Lancashire on 39-0.
But Warwickshire's win at Yorkshire and Worcestershire's victory over Notts saw the 2014 champions finish fifth in the North Group with a worse net run-rate.
Lancashire remain bottom of the group with just two wins.
Following a delay of more than four hours, play eventually got under way at 18:15 BST with each innings reduced to 24 overs, and Lancashire's Karl Brown raced to 30 not out.
The players went off for rain 30 minutes later, but it was hoped they could start again at 19:45 BST, with the match now 17 overs for each team.
However, the weather closed in again and they did not return - meaning both sides take one point.
