The world number nine pulled out of the tournament shortly before her second-round match against Wang Qiang.
Konta currently occupies the final qualifying position for the season-ending WTA Finals in Singapore.
But the 25-year-old, the first British woman in the top 10 since 1984, could be overtaken by Dominika Cibulkova if the Slovak makes the Linz Open final.
"I was really looking forward to making this week last as long as possible. It wasn't as long as I would have liked, but I need to look after my body first," said the Briton.
"I need to make sure I make the right decisions for my health."
