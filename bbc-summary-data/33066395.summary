The Yorkshire rider, 35, followed up his emotional Supersport success on Monday by taking victory by 17 seconds over early leader Michael Dunlop.
Riding a PBM Kawasaki, Hutchinson beat the race record by 32 seconds and posted the fastest lap at 130.924mph.
"Beating Michael Dunlop makes it more special," said Hutchinson.
"Michael dominated things during the four years I was unable to push at the front."
The Bingley rider overhauled Dunlop midway through Tuesday's race to take his 10th career TT win.

Hutchinson went close to losing a leg after a serious crash at Silverstone in 2010 and was out of action for a couple of seasons as he had a total of 30 operations on the injury.
Dunlop, still struggling with injuries sustained in Sunday's Superbike race, produced a courageous ride and led the eventual victor by two seconds as the riders refuelled after two laps.
However, Hutchinson moved into the lead on lap three as Dunlop's physical condition began to take its toll and the Yorkshireman was 9.4 seconds in front with one lap to go.
A disappointed Dunlop was left to ponder what might have been as he was unable to match the speed of his rival.
"I was fighting fit at the start of the fortnight but the team I was with were not giving me the tools I needed to do the job," added Dunlop.
"I had that 'off' on Sunday, through no fault of my own, and I've struggled ever since. I put everything into the first lap and then it all just fell apart."
Dunlop is considering pulling out of Wednesday's Supersport Race 2 to allow his body to recover ahead of Friday's Senior TT.
The Ballymoney man's brother William pulled out of the remainder of the meeting on Monday after breaking a rib in a practice crash on Monday.
Fermanagh rider Lee Johnston clinched his first TT podium by taking third place on the East Coast Construction BMW thanks to a flying last lap of 130.85mph, his fastest-ever on the Mountain Course.
James Hillier, Peter Hickman and David Johnson made up the top six on the leaderboard, while Guy Martin had to settle for seventh after losing time as his machine failed to fire into life after his pitstop.
