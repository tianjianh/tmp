Swindon Town 0-0 Southend United

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Swindon goalkeeper Lawrence Vigouroux produced a spectacular string of saves to earn his side a goalless draw at home to Southend.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The draw for the Shrimpers was enough to see their unbeaten streak in League One extend to 13 games but it could have been even better.
Swindon created the first chance after six minute when Anton Rodgers' corner found Raphael Rossi-Branco unmarked but the defender had his shot saved by Ted Smith.
The home side let another opportunity go begging in the 27th minute after John Obika leapt above Michael Timlin at the far post but he was unable to direct his header on target.
Southend should have taken the lead seven minutes later when Anthony Wordsworth played a cross in to Simon Cox but he was unable to reach the ball for a tap in.
Vigouroux produced a heroic double save in the 77th minute, firstly denying Jason Demetriou from close range and then substitute Zavon Hines.
The Frenchman was on hand again four minutes later to parry Hines' left-foot shot on to the post.
