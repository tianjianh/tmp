The financially troubled Sauber team is to miss the first in-season test in Spain later this month.

The Swiss outfit said they did not have a car update at the Spanish Grand Prix - which precedes the test - nor a young driver who meets the requirements.
Teams must use a driver who has raced in no more than two grands prix in two of the four days of in-season testing.
Sauber have lost two senior technicians since March and have admitted salaries have been paid late twice this year.
The team lost technical director Mark Smith in March and head of track engineering Tim Malyon in April.
Both had been in their jobs only for a matter of months and statements from Sauber cited personal reasons for their departure.
Last month, Sauber team principal Monisha Kaltenborn denied speculation within F1 that the outfit might not make it to the end of the season.
At the Russian Grand Prix last weekend, sporting director Beat Zehnder admitted Sauber faced a "really difficult time" as a result of the costs inherent in designing a new car to meet major rule changes for 2017.
"The financial impact is a massive one and for a small team like Sauber it's really difficult," Zehnder said.
"It's not only the cars and not being able to carry over parts from one year to the other, it's the list of investments you have to make.
"We're talking about millions and millions here, so for a smaller team it's really a difficult time."
