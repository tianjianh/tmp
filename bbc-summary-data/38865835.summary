[SN]TITLE[SN]
Notts County 2-1 Cheltenham Town

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Notts County maintained their unbeaten home record under new boss Kevin Nolan as they secured victory over fellow League Two strugglers Cheltenham.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Magpies started well and could have been a goal ahead in the opening 10 minutes when Mark Yeates smacked the top of the bar with a wonderful long-range drive.
Notts took the lead in the 24th minute and the architect was Michael O'Connor, who produced a wonderful pass which picked out the run of Jon Stead who ran on to smash beyond Scott Brown.
It was no more than County deserved for a vibrant display and they gave themselves a cushion when Richard Duffy's header from Yeates' corner squirmed over the line just past the half-hour mark.
That prompted Robins boss Gary Johnson into a tactical switch as he ditched a 5-4-1 system to play 4-4-2 and the new shape seemed to kick-start Cheltenham.
The extra man up front made it more of a contest and, after Jonathan Forte hit the post for the hosts, Manny Onariase grabbed a late goal.
