He will visit Washington DC in October for events linked to the Orlando 2016 Invictus Games.
In November and December, he will open a Lesotho children's centre and fulfil a "programme of engagements" in South Africa on behalf of the UK government.
The prince, 30, left the Army in June after 10 years' service.
He is currently working on conservation projects in southern Africa.
He is due to return to the UK in mid-September, when he will do voluntary work helping injured soldiers with their rehabilitation.
The visit to Lesotho will be on behalf of Harry's charity Sentebale. During the visit he will officially open its Mamohato Children's Centre, which will help vulnerable children.
His trip to South Africa is at the request of the Foreign Office, and while there he will represent the UK government.
Judith Macgregor, British High Commissioner to South Africa, said: "The visit will showcase the wide range of co-operation between our countries as well as offer an excellent platform to further develop the partnerships between the UK and South Africa and Lesotho."
Harry had the idea for the Invictus Games, which was first held in London in 2014.
The 2016 games will be held from 8-12 May next year in Orlando, Florida.
