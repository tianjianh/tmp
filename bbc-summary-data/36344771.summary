But No 10 said while it was traditional to meet US candidates visiting the UK, no invitations had been issued.
A spokeswoman said there were "no confirmed dates" for visits as party nominees had not yet been chosen.
The PM previously called Mr Trump's proposal for a ban on Muslims entering the US "stupid, divisive and wrong".
Last year Mr Trump, who is now the presumptive Republican nominee for the presidential election, said many Muslims nursed a "hatred" towards America and a ban should be in force "until our country's representatives can figure out what is going on".

While it is true that hopefuls like Scott Walker, Chris Christie and Marco Rubio met the prime-minister when they were passing through London - that was before they had declared they were candidates for the Republican nomination.
A senior source said the PM would be happy to see Mr Trump once he becomes the official nominee - that will happen after the Republican Convention in July.
Four years ago the then Republican nominee, Mitt Romney, visited Downing Street - and caused consternation when he criticised Britain's preparedness for hosting the London 2012 Olympics.
Responding to Mr Trump's comments at the time, Mr Cameron said: "I think his remarks are divisive, stupid and wrong and I think if he came to visit our country I think it'd unite us all against him."
Downing Street has since said the PM stands by his criticism of but will work with whoever is elected US president.

In an interview with US news channel MSNBC, Mr Trump said: "I will do just fine with David Cameron. I think he's a nice guy. I will do just fine."
He added: "But they have asked me to visit 10 Downing Street - and I might do it."
Speaking on Friday, Mr Trump said he had been invited to Downing Street two days ago.
Downing Street said: "It's long-standing practice for the PM to meet with the Republican and Democrat presidential nominees if they visit the UK.
"Given the parties have yet to choose their nominees, there are no confirmed dates for this."
