The 30-year-old, currently sidelined with a shoulder injury, played the last of his 126 games for the Warriors in a win over Leinster last month.
"Some of the memories I have out on the pitch are unbelievable," said Eddie, who has been with Glasgow for 10 years.
"It's amazing to see how much the club has grown and how the supporters have really got behind the team."
Eddie has featured for Scotland A and was in the sevens side which competed at the Glasgow Commonwealth Games in 2014.
"James has been a great role model for what the Warriors are all about - working hard every day to improve himself and also doing all he can to get the best out of his team-mates," said head coach Gregor Townsend.
"He has also been a great ambassador for the club and is rightly held in high regard from our supporters.
"We will miss his positive influence around the group and he is someone who will be remembered fondly by everyone at the club."
