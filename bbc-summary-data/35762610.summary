Trunki firm loses Supreme Court case over design

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A company that sells children's ride-on suitcases has lost a court battle with a rival over product design.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Magmatic - which sells Trunki suitcases decorated to look like animals or insects - said PMS International's Kiddee Case range infringed registered design rights.
Five Supreme Court judges who analysed the dispute at a hearing in November have now ruled against Magmatic
Lawyers said the ruling will have "profound" design implications.
Magmatic founder Rob Law appeared on BBC Two television show Dragons' Den in 2006, unsuccessfully seeking investment for his Trunki case.
After he was rejected by the Dragons, he went on to sell more than two million of the suitcases in more than 60 countries.
