A chapel and 10 homes and businesses, next to the Regent Circus complex in Swindon, were affected by construction work by developers ISG.
MP Robert Buckland set up a meeting for residents and ISG after complaints ISG had not "fulfilled its promise".
The BBC has contacted ISG, which is yet to comment.
Rehoboth Baptist Chapel and people living near the Regent Circus complex, which opened fully in February, are still waiting for their properties to be fixed, despite reassurances from ISG at a meeting in March 2014 that any damage would be "put right".
Residents claim subsidence and cracks have affected their homes since the start of the work in April 2013.
Swindon South MP Robert Buckland arranged the meeting after local residents complained to him that ISG had still not repaired the damage.
Mr Buckland said ISG had "agreed a two-week timetable within which they would write to the 10 properties that are covered by the Party Walls Act with details of the remedial works that they will carry out".
He said: "The lack of action on behalf of the developers to help local residents who have been adversely affected by their work concerns me, however.
"By bringing ISG directly to the table, I hope that progress can finally be made to rectify any damage caused, and I will be doing all that I can to ensure that this happens."
Peter Green, from the Back Garden residents group, said: "We are pleased that ISG are again talking to residents. Only time will tell if ISG will this time deliver on their promises."
