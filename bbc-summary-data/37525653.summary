Bruce Springsteen signs young student's absence note

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A schoolboy from the US city of Philadelphia who skipped class to meet his musical hero handed his teacher an absence note with a difference.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The typewritten note was signed by rock legend Bruce Springsteen.
Fifth-grader Michael Fenerty met the star at a "meet-and-greet" in the Free Library of Philadelphia.
Springsteen, known to his legions of fans as "The Boss", was in town signing copies of his new autobiography, Born to Run.
Michael's father, Mike Fenerty, told the Philadelphia Inquirer that he wanted to follow school rules for his son's absence and was told that he would need Bruce Springsteen to sign an absence note.
So he typed out a letter to the principal that read: "Please excuse Michael Fenerty for being late or absent today. He came to the Free Library of Philadelphia to meet me and get a copy of my book."
When fifth-grader Michael met the singer, he asked him: "Bruce, would you sign my absence note?"
Mr Fenerty told the Inquirer: "[Springsteen] lit up. He said: 'I have to read it first, that's how I got in trouble with my first contract.'
"My son was very star-struck - it was a very cool experience."
Mr Fenerty said he had handed the school a photocopy of the note, keeping the original as a souvenir.
