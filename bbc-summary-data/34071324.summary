Reaction: UK migration reaches record high

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Net migration to the UK reached a record high of 330,000 in the year to March, official figures show. Here is some of the reaction.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
"These are very stark figures that show how we've been knocked off course by EU migration and how equally the impact that students who don't leave at the end of their studies has, and the reliance that business continues to place on migrant labour.
"There are significant issues that we have to challenge as a majority government to bring net migration down to those sustainable levels that existed before the last Labour government."
"These figures show David Cameron needs to stop the dishonesty over his failed immigration target and replace it with a sensible plan instead which properly separates immigration and asylum.
"All his overblown rhetoric has achieved is a decline in public confidence as the electorate are faced with more broken promises.
"At the same time he has failed to tackle the exploitation by dodgy employers and agencies which is driving low skilled migration, undercutting wages and jobs and at its worst creating modern slavery.
"Meanwhile universities and businesses are finding the system too rigid to get the top international talent they need."
"These record-breaking figures are shocking. Only one month ago [Home Secretary] Theresa May told the home affairs committee that net migration of under 100,000 was her target.
"This is clearly not going to happen. Broken promises on migration do not build confidence with the public. We need a radically different approach."
"We've admitted countries like Bulgaria and Romania into a political union with us. I said two years ago this would lead to a very large number of people coming into the country.
"I was laughed at but I'm afraid it's proved to be true. The minimum wage in Britain is nine times higher than the minimum wage in Romania, so these are the main drivers."
"These highest-ever net migration figures highlight how fundamental it is that the prime minister must secure physical control of our borders as a key red and blue line in his renegotiation exercise with Europe.
"The failure of all the political parties in not making this a key demand will mean that they will never ever be able to tell the British electorate that they can bring immigration under control and deliver."
"What this means for the UK is subjective. There is no objective way to decide what the "right" number of migrants is, and reasonable people will disagree.
"What is clear is that reducing net migration to below 100,000 remains a distant prospect, at least under current economic conditions and policies."
"Net migration at one third of a million a year is clearly unsustainable.
"Nearly half of the inflow is now from the EU, including 50,000 from Romania and Bulgaria as we have long predicted."
