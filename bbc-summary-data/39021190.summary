Celtic Dragons are aiming for the top four in this year's Superleague despite an opening day defeat to Team Bath.

An impressive first quarter saw the Dragons take the lead 11-10, but the title record holders fought back with the game ending 51-41 in their favour.
"The second quarter let us down and that meant we were chasing the game," captain Suzy Drane told BBC Wales Sport.
"But the rest of the three quarters were really tight and competitive."
Dragons faces Scottish Sirens in their next game on 25 February in the new Super Ten event in Birmingham.
Sirens are one of three new franchises for the 2017 season and head coach Trish Wilcox is relishing the challenge as she targets an impressive campaign.
"It's a great challenge and I think it's a very exciting league this year because there is so much unknown which really levels the playing field," she explained.
We're not coming here to participate and we want to get (into the) top four."
