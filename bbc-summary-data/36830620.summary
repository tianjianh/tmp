[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 25-year-old has agreed a two-year contract after leaving Australia A-League side Newcastle Jets.
Last year, Birighitti spent six months on loan at Varese, where he worked with Swans coach Gabriele Ambrosetti.
He is the fourth goalkeeper on Swansea's senior books, alongside Lukasz Fabianski, Kristoffer Nordfeldt and Gerhard Tremmel.
Birighitti was named in the A-League's 2015-16 team of the season after impressive displays for Jets, and has made one appearance for Australia - against China in 2013.
He was an unused substitute in the 2-1 defeat by England in May.
Birighitti has also represented his country at under-17, under-20 and under-23 level.
