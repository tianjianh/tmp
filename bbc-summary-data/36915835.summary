The 26-year-old Senegalese, who joined QPR from Arsenal in 2011, was released from Loftus Road in June, having not made a QPR appearance since April 2015.
Traore, who played 93 games for the Rs, helped them win the Championship play-off final against Derby in 2014.
After moving to Arsenal from Monaco in 2005, Traore played 35 games and was also loaned to Portsmouth and Juventus.
France-born Traore's three-year contract at the City Ground will run from 1 August.
His signing comes on the same day that the Championship side announced the retirement of midfielder Andy Reid, at the age of 34.
Traore becomes the sixth summer addition made by new Forest boss Philippe Montanier, four of which have been defenders.
He follows Finland's Thomas Lam from Dutch Eredivisie side PEC Zwolle, Poland's Damien Perquis and Hildeberto Pereira, on loan from Benfica, goalkeeper Stephen Henderson and former Everton striker Apostolos Vellios from Greek club Iraklis Thessaloniki.
