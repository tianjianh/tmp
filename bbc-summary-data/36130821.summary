Cardiff City defender Sean Morrison insists his side can cope with the pressure ahead of Saturday's must-win Championship encounter at Sheffield Wednesday.

Cardiff are four points behind the sixth-placed Owls, who occupy the final play-off spot with two games left.
The Bluebirds must win at Hillsborough to have a chance of leapfrogging Wednesday on the final weekend.
"A lot of us have played in big-pressure games," said Morrison.
"Most of us in this changing room have been playing in this game long enough to deal with those kind of things.
"It will just be work as normal, we'll have a normal week.
"If we go out there and all do our jobs properly I'm sure we'll come back with the win, hopefully."
An injury-time penalty from Peter Whittingham gave the Bluebirds a 2-1 win against Bolton on Saturday after Wednesday's 1-1 draw at Derby earlier in the day.
If Russell Slade's side beat Wednesday, they will trail the Yorkshire club by just one point ahead of the final round of matches.
Cardiff will be at home against Birmingham City, while Wednesday visit Wolves on Saturday, 7 May.
The Sheffield side only need a draw against Cardiff to seal their place in the play-offs, but Morrison does not expect Carlos Carvalhal's side to sit back.
"Their philosophy of playing football with their manager is to pass the ball and try and create opportunities.
"I don't think they will sit back and go for the draw. I think they will come at us and we'll come at them. I think it will be a very entertaining game.
"We need to go out there and get a win. If we don't get a win, then it's game over, season done.
"We haven't worked this hard to just give up there.
"It's going to be a tough place to go. I expect they are going to have a sell-out and it's going to be an intimidating crowd."
