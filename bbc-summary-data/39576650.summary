Cruise liner AIDAvita gets 'potentially record' Invergordon season under way

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The first liner to visit Invergordon in 2017 has launched what could turn out to be its best ever year for cruise tourism.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
About 1,200 German tourists are expected to make their way ashore from the AIDAvita.
Cromarty Firth Port Authority believes it will be a record year for cruise liner business.
Invergordon's projections are based on 91 scheduled calls by cruise liners and more than 142,000 passengers.
It would represent a 45% increase in trade compared to last year.
It is estimated the influx could bring in Â£14m for the local economy.
