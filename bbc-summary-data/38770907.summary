[SN]TITLE[SN]
Savings protection limit raised

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Savings of up to £85,000 will be safe if a bank or building society collapses from now - following a £10,000 rise in the protection level.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The weakening of the pound against the euro since the Brexit vote led to the change in the threshold.
The amount of compensation payable is set at €100,000 across the European Union, so significant currency moves can alter the level for UK savers.
The change means the protection returns to its pre-July 2015 level.
It covers money in current accounts, savings accounts, and cash ISAs.
Under the Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS), up to £85,000 per person, per institution is now protected if a bank, building society or credit union goes bust. In other words, if the bank collapses, savers will get any money in these accounts up to £85,000 paid back in compensation.
Joint accounts have a protection level of £170,000.
Mark Neale, chief executive of the FSCS, said: "The limit increase will protect even more of peoples' savings. The new limit will protect about 98% of people so it is worth people knowing their limits."
The scheme has a protection checker for savers.
Some MPs have been critical of the way the limit has fluctuated and have called for a settled level to maintain public awareness.
At the start of the banking crisis in 2007 the maximum payout for depositors was just £31,700 per person, made up of 100% of the first £2,000 and then 90% of their next £33,000.
