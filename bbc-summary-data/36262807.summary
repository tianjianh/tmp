The 41-year-old will be assisted at Milan's San Siro stadium by fellow Englishmen Simon Beck and Jake Collin.
Clattenburg, who will also referee the FA Cup final, said he was "stunned but absolutely delighted" by his call-up.
The additional assistant referees will be England's Anthony Taylor and Andre Marriner. Hungarian Viktor Kassai has been named as the fourth official.
"It will be a huge challenge but ultimately one that I'm massively looking forward to," said Clattenburg.
"I'm going to be representing my country and the 27,000 referees in England and the great thing is that I can share the success with my team of officials."
