[SN]TITLE[SN]
Gloucestershire v Durham: Late wickets peg hosts back after Will Tavare hits 61

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Will Tavare and Chris Dent hit half-centuries but late wickets helped Durham peg Gloucestershire back.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Tavare and Dent shared an 83-run second-wicket stand before the latter was caught behind off Paul Collingwood.
Captain Collingwood completed a double-wicket maiden as Graeme van Buuren fell for a duck as the hosts fell to 97-3.
Chris Rushworth had Tavare caught behind for 61 before Keaton Jennings took two wickets in two balls to leave the hosts 265-7 at Bristol.
Wicketkeeper Phil Mustard made a useful 38 in his first innings against his former club, and shared a 64-run sixth-wicket partnership with Jack Taylor as Gloucestershire looked to push on following Tavare's dismissal.
But Jennings had Mustard and Craig Miles caught at first slip by Collingwood to leave honours even as bad light brought play to an early close on day one.
