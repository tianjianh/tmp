[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Olympic champions Hannah Mills, Owain Doull and Elinor Barker along with Paralympian Hollie Arnold have become MBEs in the New Year Honours list.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Sailor Mills, cyclists Doull and Barker, all from Cardiff, and field athlete Arnold, from Hengoed, Caerphilly county, struck gold in Rio.
Ex-Arts Council of Wales chairman Prof Dai Smith and assembly standards chief Gerard Elias QC were appointed CBEs.
There was also an OBE for Monmouthshire council leader Peter Fox.
Martyn Hooper, who founded the Bridgend-based Pernicious Anaemia Society said he was "privileged" to have been appointed an OBE in the honours.
The 57-year-old started the society in 2004 after being forced to take early retirement from teaching after developing irreversible nerve damage which left him permanently disabled.
"The honour shows that the society that I started 12 years ago is now an established and respected patient group that is able to raise awareness of the issues faced by patients with pernicious anaemia and their families and friends," he said.
"There is great variation in how the disease is treated, not only in the UK but throughout the world, and we now know the current one-size-fits-all treatment is not suitable for all patients and this is what we are now trying to change."
There were also OBEs for Cardiff trio Dr Siriol David, for services to offender management, Oxford University emeritus professor of education, Prof John Furlong, for services to research in education, and government and Bernadette Jones for her work with unemployed people in south east Wales.
Christopher Nott, from Cardiff, has been appointed an OBE for services to business and economic development in Wales, as was Monmouth's Dr Arthur Steiner who founded Hands Around The World, which helps disadvantaged children abroad.
Other CBEs included Prof Anita Thapar from the institute of psychological medicine and clinical neurosciences at Cardiff University and Prof Hywel Thomas for services to academic research and higher education.
Among the MBE appointments:
Campaigner June Thomas from Oakdale, Caerphilly county, whose 15-year-old son Jack died in 2012, has been awarded a BEM for her work that led to defibrillators being installed in Welsh schools.
BEMs have also been received by Janet Jeffries from Cardiff, for her work with LGBT people in Wales, and Gweneira Baty from Cowbridge, for services to young and elderly people in the town and Llanblethian.
