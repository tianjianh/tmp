[SN]TITLE[SN]
Nile Ranger was 'crazy sex pest', court hears

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A former Premier League footballer accused of raping a woman in a hotel acted like a "crazy sex pest animal let out of his cage", a court has heard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Former Newcastle United striker Nile Ranger, 22, denies rape in January last year.
Newcastle Crown Court heard that the alleged victim sent him a text message calling him a "predator".
The player, who is now with League One Swindon Town, responded by saying she made him sound like Jack the Ripper.
The jury was read an exchange of text messages Mr Ranger sent the women in the weeks prior to the alleged incident.
He repeatedly asked her to be his girlfriend, or to meet him or go out for a drink, but she refused, saying she already had a boyfriend.
In one exchange she said: "No, you're a sex pest, told you I would be mates, nothing more."
Another read: "You're like a crazy sex pest animal let out of its cage on a monthly cycle."
She also referred to him as "a predator, can't deal with that" and described him as "Nile Ripper".
The trial had earlier heard that the pair had been out together in Newcastle, and she woke up naked next to Mr Ranger not knowing where she was.
CCTV footage has also been shown of the pair arriving in a taxi at the Carlton Hotel in Jesmond, Newcastle, where the alleged victim could be seen falling out of the car.
After being arrested, Mr Ranger told police they had had sex twice and she had consented "wholeheartedly" and "enthusiastically".
The prosecution had earlier said that on previous occasion she had gone back to a hotel with him as he said he wanted to talk to her, but she left after he started kissing her neck and touching her leg, the court heard.
The trial continues.
