The Preston-born 21-year-old had made 14 appearances on loan for Rovers this season, keeping four clean sheets.
The England Under-20 international has had previous loan spells at Scunthorpe, Yeovil and Walsall, but has yet to play for the Old Trafford club.
"We tried to do something in the summer with him," said boss Simon Grayson.
"When a player comes available who you think is going to improve the squad, regardless of what you have already, then it's something you go and do."
As well as being born in the town, Johnstone's father Glenn played 10 games for the Lilywhites in the 1990s.
"If anyone else other than Preston had shown an interest in me, the likelihood would have been I would have stayed at Doncaster, who have been very good to me, but this being my hometown club it was difficult to turn down," said Johnstone.
His departure leaves Doncaster short of goalkeeping options for Tuesday's FA Cup third-round replay at Bristol City.
Marko Marosi, who was on the bench for the  is Rovers' second-choice keeper, but is yet to start a first-team game.
