Radio 1's Big Weekend 2015: Swot up on Norwich

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Nick Grimshaw has announced that Radio 1's Big Weekend 2015 will take place in Norwich.

Thousands of music fans will descend on Earlham Park for the station's flagship event on 23 and 24 May.
Last year's event in Glasgow was headlined by Coldplay and Katy Perry. Taylor Swift is the first name on this year's line-up.
But before you pack your bags for East Anglia, here's a chance to swat up on some local knowledge.
Steve Coogan's fictional radio host may have helped to boost the profile of the city.
But Alan Partridge is far from the only big name with connections to the East Anglian county.
Hugh Jackman is a big fan of Norwich City football club, which is part owned by TV chef Delia Smith.
And of course Stephen Fry is a supporter of the Canaries too, having been on the club's board since 2010.
Tim Westwood went to Norwich's Hewett School, as did TV presenter Jake Humphrey whose mum used to teach there too.
Former Hear Say singer Mylene Klass also went to school in Norwich, while S Club 7's Hannah Spearritt is from just down the road in Gorleston.
Ed Balls, yes the MP who wrote his own name on Twitter, and beauty vlogger Tanya Burr were born in Norwich too.
Did you know both Colemans mustard and Kettle chips are made in Norwich?
The Big Weekend will see him returning to the city where he started his presenting career on University of East Anglia's (UEA) student station Livewire and community station Future Radio.
This year's Big Weekend will be in the grounds of the campus.
In 2011 Norwich played host to the final leg of the station's student tour which saw Coldplay playing at the UEA.
Fearne's show was live from a student bar every morning for a week, and then Zane joined Noah and The Whale, Example, Kasabian and Coldplay for four one-off gigs.
Yes, the puppet man.
His real name is David Perry and he's a street performer armed with a karaoke machine and a set of hand puppets.
The puppet man has become such a cult figure in the city that he has his own website and Wikipedia page and local folklore will tell you he almost had a cameo in Hollyoaks.
But he's got no connection to the city's Puppet Theatre.
A standard sightseeing tour of Norwich will include the castle, the cathedral, the river Wensum and the recently renovated market near City Hall.
But if you want to go off the beaten track there's a whole novel painted on a building.
Getting to the Big Weekend shouldn't be too much of an issue as Norwich's train and coach stations have services running to and from major cities across the UK.
But if you're planning on coming from further afield there's also the option of getting a flight to Norwich's international airport.
