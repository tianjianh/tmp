Ethan Houghton, 13, from Dunstable, died, together with his mum and brother, in the crash on the A34 on Wednesday.
The teenager had played for the under-14 team at Dunstable Football Club.
The club said tributes would be paid at its next first team home match.
"The club is deeply shocked," said the club's Simon Reilly. "He was a very popular lad who will be sorely missed."
He said the players would wear black armbands in memory of Ethan during their Emirates FA Cup preliminary round match against Chesham United on 20 August.
A photo of Ethan will also be put on the front page of the programme and the under-14 team will walk on the pitch together with the first team.
The crash happened between Chieveley and East Ilsley at about 17:10 BST on Wednesday.
Ethan was with his mum Tracy Houghton, 45 and brother Joshua, 11, along with an 11-year-old girl.
Thames Valley Police declined to comment on reports Ms Houghton's partner was driving behind in a separate car at the time of the crash.
A 30-year-old man from Andover, who was driving one of the lorries involved in the crash, was arrested on suspicion of causing death by dangerous driving. He has been bailed until 5 October.
Thames Valley Police said a further 12 people were injured.
