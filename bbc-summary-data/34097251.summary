[SN]TITLE[SN]
Royal Black Institution on parade in Northern Ireland

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
About 17,000 members of the Royal Black Institution have taken part in demonstrations across Northern Ireland.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Parades were held at five locations on what is known within the institution as Black Saturday.
The largest parade was held in Kilkeel, County Down.
Earlier, Belfast preceptories marched past St Patrick's Catholic Church on Donegall Street to a single drum beat.
Restrictions were imposed by the Parades Commission, following controversy at previous loyal order demonstrations.
The last Saturday in August is traditionally the most important day in the Royal Black Institution's year.
