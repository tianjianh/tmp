Luke Williams: EFL Cup tie v QPR can give Swindon Town belief, says head coach

Swindon Town boss Luke Williams says an EFL Cup first-round visit to Queens Park Rangers can give his squad belief.

Championship side QPR will host League One Swindon at Loftus Road in August.
The Robins won 2-0 at QPR in round two in 2013-14, starting a run of seven wins in 11 games, and Williams knows a similar result could lift his squad.
"A game like that can turn your fortunes for you and give people that extra bit of belief and confidence," Williams told BBC Wiltshire.
"It is a good situation to be in. You're not really expected to win, but you can certainly give everything.
"It's a freebie, if you like. If we did (win), people would consider it a big achievement. We can certainly look forward to that one."
Swindon, winners of the League Cup in 1969, lost 2-1 at home to Exeter in the first round last season.
