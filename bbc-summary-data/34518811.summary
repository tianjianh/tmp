BBC Wales Today commissioned graffiti artist Bradley Woods to create an image of Gareth Bale on the side of the Hearing & Mobility shop in Whitchurch to mark Euro 2016 qualification.
In Brazil, graffiti is a popular way of honouring football players.
Passers-by were impressed with the artwork.
Any Vaughan-Davies from Llandaff, Cardiff, said: "It's awesome. Very striking. I saw it earlier on today and I think all the detail he's added in is fantastic."
Elaine Bissenden from Rhiwbina, Cardiff, said:  "It's fantastic. I'm amazed. You can tell who it is."
Chris Davey from Penarth, Vale of Glamorgan, added: "Now that you tell me I can see it's Gareth Bale. It's really good. Not garish with bright colours like some graffiti."
Cardiff-born Bale became the world's most expensive footballer when he transferred from Tottenham to Real Madrid for Â£85.3m in September 2013.
On Tuesday, BBC Wales Today has a special programme from 18:30 BST ahead of the Wales v Andorra game at Cardiff City Stadium.
