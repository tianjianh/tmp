Portsmouth 4-2 Wycombe Wanderers

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Portsmouth came from behind against Wycombe at Fratton Park to earn a fourth league victory in a row.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Wycombe went ahead when Paul Hayes found the back of the net from close range after 10 minutes.
The home side hit back when defender Christian Burgess bundled the ball over the line before Gary Roberts put Pompey ahead from the penalty spot after Sido Jombati blocked Gareth Evans' header with his hand.
Hayes fired in his second goal with an impressive finish to equalise in first-half stoppage time.
But Conor Chaplin immediately restored Portsmouth's lead, lifting the ball over Anthony Stewart in the area and heading past the onrushing Jamal Blackman.
Carl Baker got on the end of an Enda Stevens cross to volley in Pompey's fourth to seal victory.
