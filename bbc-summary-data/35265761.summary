Paula Banks began fundraising for Bristol Children's Hospital after her son Jack was diagnosed with leukaemia in 2003. He died in 2008 aged nine.
The fund also supports Captain Jack's toy box - which allows sick children to choose a toy ahead of an operation.
Ms Banks said the Points of Light award was "an absolute honour".
The mother-of-two who lives near Bristol is already working towards her next fundraising target to help refurbish 10 isolation rooms where bone marrow patients spend months recovering.
The Wallace & Gromit's Grand Appeal supports sick babies and children at Bristol Children's Hospital and at St Michaels Hospital.
The Points of Light award recognises outstanding individuals who make a change in their community.
