Carmarthen Park, which opened in 1900, will be turned into a training and competition venue for cyclists.
Carmarthenshire council agreed on Monday to give £286,000 to the project, after Sport Wales pledged £296,000.
The local authority hopes it will increase interest in cycling and bring high class racing to the area.
With an original grandstand, bandstand and lodge, it has been used for a wide range of sports, eisteddfodau, circuses and concerts.
The investment will see the track upgraded and improved safety fencing put in.
The council's executive board member Meryl Gravell told Monday's meeting that "cycling was on the up" in the county and across Wales and the project was "worthy of support".
