[SN]TITLE[SN]
New town of Tornagrain to grow over 60 years

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A planned new town in the Highlands will take up to 60 years to build, the site's owners have said.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Tornagrain would be constructed on a site between Inverness and Nairn. The land is owned by Moray Estates.
The 5,000-home development near Inverness Airport would begin with a first phase of 190 properties.
Highland councillors gave the project outline planning permission in 2012. Once completed, the town could accommodate more than 10,000 people.
To mark out the site, a group of standing stones has been erected in a ceremony attended by John Stuart, the Earl of Moray, and Business, Energy and Tourism Minister Fergus Ewing and Provost of Inverness Helen Carmichael.
