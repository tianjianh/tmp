Jamie Donaldson was pleased with his opening-round score at the WGC-Cadillac Championship but acknowledged there was room for improvement.

Welshman Donaldson carded a two-under opening round of 70 at the Trump National Golf Club in Miami.
The 40-year-old is four shots behind joint-leaders Scott Piercy of the USA and Australia's Marcus Fraser.
"I'm happy with the score but I didn't really play that good," Donaldson said.
"I don't really know where I'm going to hit it, which is interesting so I'm just literally pegging it up and smashing it.
"I've hit left and right all over the place so I'm happy with two under.
"The last couple of weeks in the last two tournaments over here I've hit in places that I didn't even know were there on golf courses.
"It's good because it gives your short game good practice and if your short game is good then generally you're going to get up and down more times than you're not."
