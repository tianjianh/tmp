[SN]TITLE[SN]
Nurse suspended over school uniform request to patient

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A mental health nurse who asked a patient to return to her next appointment wearing her school uniform has been suspended.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Gary Snape was working for North Essex Partnership Trust when he committed a string of patient care failings.
A Nursing and Midwifery Council conduct panel heard Mr Snape had also asked "inappropriately" a patient to tie material around her body.
The panel suspended Mr Snape from working as a nurse for six months.

The panel heard how in 2009, Mr Snape had used drama therapy techniques with a patient, who at the time was of school age, without being suitably qualified.
He also told her he wanted to wear her school uniform at their next appointment. However, the panel's report on the case did not indicate why Mr Snape made this request of the girl.
The panel said Mr Snape had shown "developing insight" and an "open and honest approach" to the proceedings and had tried "to remedy his practice".
However, the panel also found Mr Snape, who is not currently working as a nurse, had "behaved in such a way that could have foreseeably resulted in harm to the patients in his care".
