Changes to how Instagram content will appear in the app's feed have sparked a backlash among some of its users.

The app plans to switch to "algorithmic timelines" - sorting posts according to users' interests - rather continuing to list them chronologically.
Celebrity posters, who are worried their photos may no longer be seen by as many people, have urged their followers to "turn on notifications".
But Instagram said there was no reason to panic.
"We're listening and we assure you nothing is changing with your feed right now," the photo-sharing app said in a tweet.
The shift will bring the app in line with the way news feeds are ordered on Facebook, which is owned by the same company.
By turning on notifications for a celebrity, their followers should receive an alert every time the star posts something.
Celebrities including the reality star Kylie Jenner and the supermodel Cindy Crawford have in recent days requested their fans turn on their notifications settings.
"I hate this new update Instagram is slowly trying to introduce," Jenner said in a post that drew more than 17,000 comments.
"If it's not broke, don't fix it - I don't really understand it and there has to be another motive because you follow people for a reason."
Portuguese clothes vendor New Fangle Clothing posted: "It's still happening - Instagram is changing and if you don't want to miss any of our updates please turn on post notifications."
"If you like my works and still want to see my illustrations, turn on the notifications please," appealed illustrator Julio Cesar, who has close to 130,000 followers.
An online petition called Keep Instagram chronological also emerged, drawing more than 317,000 signatures.
While the movement has grown into a top trend on the site, others users have begun to express their frustration at "annoying" requests, with many saying they would not be turning on any notifications.
"I'm tired of everyone telling me what to do on Instagram today," tweeted one US-based user, who added she would be leaving her notifications switched off.
"Oh, Instagram isn't going to be instant anymore? Who cares, there's an unfollow button for a reason," said a user in Japan.
"No thanks - My phone will not be ringing off the hook for your selfies and food posts," another user posted.
