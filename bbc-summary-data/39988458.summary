A groin injury ruled Wales' Webb out of the encounter at Thomond Park.
He told Clwb Rygbi: "I picked up a little groin spasm on Thursday and couldn't make it for today.
"Just one or two days more and I would have been fine. You have to look after yourself. I don't want to make it worse."
The injury prevented Webb taking on Lions rival Conor Murray, of Munster and Ireland.
