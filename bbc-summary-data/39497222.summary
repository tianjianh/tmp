The trio will set off at 15:12 BST on Thursday, with Knox aiming to improve on missing the cut in his Augusta National debut last year.
Sandy Lyle plays alongside English amateur Scott Gregory and Sean O'Hair.
England's Danny Willett begins his Masters defence alongside Matt Kuchar and Australian amateur Curtis Luck.
Northern Ireland's Rory McIlroy plays alongside Spain's Jon Rahm and Japan's Hideto Tanihara at 18:41, while world number one Dustin Johnson is in the final group with two-time winner Bubba Watson and Jimmy Walker at 19:03.
The 31-year-old Knox, ranked No 23 in the world, has won twice on the PGA Tour and in 2015 became the first Scot to win a World Golf Championship.
Knox and 1988 champion Lyle are the only Scots in the field, which contains a record 11 Englishman.
