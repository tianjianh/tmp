Captain Eoin Morgan hopes England can reach the final of the one-day tri-series to aid their preparations for the upcoming World Cup.

The winners of Friday's game with India in Perth will go forward to meet hosts Australia at the same venue on Sunday.
Morgan told BBC Sport: "I don't think it's added pressure.
"If we win and go through to the final it will give us momentum and confidence going into the World Cup. I think that's key within itself."
England have lost both of their games against Australia in the tournament but beat India by nine wickets in their first meeting on 20 January.
Left-handed batsman Morgan added: "We can't look too far ahead. We'll focus on tomorrow's game and hopefully produce our best.
"I don't think you can ever be happy with where you're at as a side or as an individual, so I think it's important that guys keep striving to improve.
"Tomorrow is a new day and another chance to go out and prove themselves and for every individual to go and strive to win man of the match.
"It's something we've talked about in the past, and it's something we'll look to do throughout the World Cup."
England are expected to name an unchanged side for the game.
Meanwhile, Morgan has confirmed that he will enter the auction for this year's Indian Premier League (IPL).
The IPL, which runs from 8 April until 24 May, clashes with England's three-Test tour of the West Indies - although Morgan has not played a Test since February 2012 - and the start of their home Test series against New Zealand.
Morgan missed last year's IPL to concentrate on trying to win back his Test place, but admits those hopes have now been "scaled down."
The 28-year-old said: "The ambition still is to play Test cricket, absolutely, but given where I'm at the moment, I think the IPL is the best thing for me."
All-rounder Ravi Bopara and batsman Alex Hales, who are also in Australia as part of England's tri-series and World Cup squad, have also put themselves forward for the auction, which takes place on 16 February.
Bopara has also been out of the Test side since 2012, while Hales is uncapped in the five-day format.
Both players were unsold in last year's IPL auction, when Kevin Pietersen was the only current or former England international to be purchased.
The World Cup, co-hosted by Australia and New Zealand, runs from 14 February until 29 March.
England (from): Ian Bell, Moeen Ali, James Taylor, Joe Root, Eoin Morgan (capt), Ravi Bopara, Jos Buttler (wk), Chris Woakes, Stuart Broad, James Anderson, Steven Finn, Alex Hales, Chris Jordan, James Tredwell.
