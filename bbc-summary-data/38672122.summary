£200m A55/A494 Deeside roads revamp consultation in March

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Plans for a £200m overhaul to ease congestion on the A55/A494 dual carriageway in Flintshire are to go out to public consultation.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Proposals to tackle hold-ups on the Deeside corridor between Queensferry and Northop date back over 10 years.
One option includes a new link road to the A55 at Northop via Flintshire Bridge on the A548, and the second involves improving the existing road.
The 12-week consultation starts in March, the Welsh Government announced.
Economy Secretary Ken Skates said: "The road is consistently carrying more traffic than it was designed to do and this is causing regular congestions issues.
"There is clear need for the road to be upgraded and brought up to modern standards.
"Both options in this consultation will deliver a safer, more sustainable, better connected road, with improved capacity, reliability and journey times."
