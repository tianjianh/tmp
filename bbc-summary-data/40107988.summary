The 23-year-old, who made 18 league starts during two years at Vale, has agreed a two-year deal with the Mariners and is manager Russell Slade's third signing of the summer.
"Russell has been a manager at some great clubs and is a big name in football," he told Grimsby's website.
"When I got the original call from my agent, I couldn't turn down the opportunity to work with him (Slade)."
Grimsby recently also signed midfielder Mitch Rose from Newport County and youngster Siriki Dembele from the Nike Academy.
