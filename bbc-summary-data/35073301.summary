[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Malorie Bantala, 22, gave birth at 32 weeks to a stillborn boy following the assault in London in June this year.
Kevin Wilson and a 17-year-old youth allegedly attacked her when she refused a termination.
Both defendants deny child destruction and causing grievous bodily harm.
The Old Bailey has heard how Mr Wilson became angry after Miss Bantala refused to have an abortion and told him she would keep their child.
Giving evidence in his defence, the teaching assistant apologised for his behaviour towards her but maintained he was "napping" at home in Bermondsey, south-east London, when Miss Bantala was assaulted.
He told jurors he was "shocked and surprised" when he found out about the pregnancy, and he had lied to Ms Bantala by saying he planned to go to Ghana because he did not want to "play happy families".
He said: "I told Malorie that I'm too young to have a child [and to] have an abortion."
Between May and June, Mr Wilson told jurors he had no contact with Miss Bantala after they rowed over her telling friends he was the father and accused her of sleeping with other men.
Mr Wilson told jurors that in the months before Miss Bantala lost the baby, he had "moved on" with another girlfriend.
He confirmed that the young woman had fallen pregnant but she did not have a child.
On June 15, the day of the attack, the defendant said he had worked at a school for children with behavioural problems and walked home afterwards.
Miss Bantala was left with life-threatening internal bleeding following the attack in Peckham, south-east London.
Her stillborn baby boy was delivered by Caesarian section.
The trial continues.
