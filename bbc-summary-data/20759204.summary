Cook, 27, scored three centuries to inspire England's 2-1 win in his first tour since becoming Test captain.
"There were handshakes, hugs, embraces and slaps on the back all around in the England dressing room. They have worked so hard in this series. What odds were there on us witnessing that? It's quite remarkable. They have done it the hard way, through outstanding leadership on and off the pitch."
"He is a most impressive young man and leads from the front," Clarke told BBC Test Match Special.
"He changed the whole series with his second innings in Ahmedabad. I have the greatest admiration for him."
He added: "It's going to be tremendous watching him evolve as one of the greatest batsmen in the world and as a captain.
"There's no doubt this is Alastair Cook's team. There were very big boots to fill but it looks like he has got the right-sized feet."
Clarke was also full of praise for Kevin Pietersen's performance following his reintegration into the team.
Pietersen made a match-winning century in the second Test to help England level the series.
"He has had an outstanding tour," said Clarke. "His innings in Mumbai changed the context of the entire series.
"He played brilliantly and has been an integral part of the team. They are all delighted to have him here and great credit to everyone involved.

"There's a calmness and comfort about the team when they are in each other's company."
Clarke also commended team director Andy Flower on his planning for the series.
"We wanted to treat the series like an Ashes series and were absolutely determined that no corners would be cut in the planning," he said.
"If you don't embrace India with all its culture and fascinations you won't make it. That meant a lot of planning and the team's performance has demonstrated the quality of Andy Flower's work."
