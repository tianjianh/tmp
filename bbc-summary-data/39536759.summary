[SN]TITLE[SN]
Dumbarton 0-2 Dunfermline Athletic

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Dumbarton's Scottish Championship survival hopes were dealt a blow after two late goals condemned them to a home defeat by Dunfermline.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Sons had the best chance of the first half when Gregor Buchanan shot meekly at Pars goalkeeper Sean Murdoch.
That miss proved costly when Dunfermline's Rhys McCabe and David Hopkirk struck in the final 10 minutes.
With a poorer goal difference than St Mirren, the loss leaves Dumbarton second-bottom with three games to play.
