State-owned First Channel TV is the government's main media conduit.
There are around two dozen radio stations, most of them privately-owned. Only a handful broadcast nationwide. Four newspapers publish three or four times a week.
The media usually enjoy greater editorial freedoms than their regional counterparts. But journalists often encounter pressure from private media owners or the authorities, says US-based Freedom House.
Internet users make up 24 per cent of the population (Internetlivestats.com, 2014). Mobile phones are used extensively to access the web.
Facebook use is on the rise - the platform is used by around 26 per cent of internet users. Russia's Mail.ru and Odnoklassniki.ru are popular social media platforms.
