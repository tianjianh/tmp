Ed Joyce (73), Luke Wright (50) and Ross Taylor (50) all made half-centuries as Sussex totalled 271.
But Ryder then made a round 100, sharing a key 83-run fifth-wicket stand with Essex skipper Ryan ten Doeschate, who went on to finish on 49 not out.
He helped his side then get home on 275-5 with an over to spare.
Essex's win maintained their fine record at Hove, where they have only lost three times in 15 visits, a run dating back to 1986.
Essex got their One-Day Cup campaign off to a winning start in Southampton on Sunday when they chased down 311 to beat Hampshire in the final over.
They do not play again until Somerset's visit to Chelmsford this Sunday (22 June, 11:00 BST), while Sussex play Glamorgan in Cardiff on Wednesday (18 June, 14:00 BST).
