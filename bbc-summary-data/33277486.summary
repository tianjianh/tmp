Actor Dean Gaffney is reprising his role in the BBC One soap for six episodes later this year.
"All they've told me is that Robbie, as always, is hapless in love and business, so I think this trend is continuing," said Gaffney.
"And I believe he comes back with a son," he added. The actor, who was last seen on the show in 2010, returns as part of his mum, Carol Jackson's, exit.
Actress Lindsey Coulson will leave the show later this year, five years after making a comeback - although she has appeared on the soap, on and off, since 1993.
"I would actually surrender me coming back for Lindsey to stay," said Gaffney who could not reveal any details about her departure from the show.
"I think it's a shame for the show she's leaving, but I think she'll go on to bigger and better things."
Executive producer Dominic Treadwell-Collins said: "EastEnders has always been so lucky to have an actress of Lindsey's calibre in the company - but we always knew that it wasn't indefinitely.
"Lindsey's nuanced, brave and utterly real performance rightfully won her an award and praise from viewers, charities and women who have been through similar experiences to Carol.
"The door will always be open for Carol's return."
Gaffney's character Robbie was last seen walking his sister Bianca down the aisle, before heading off to India to be with his pregnant wife, Nita.
He revealed he was with his friend, Coronation Street's Ryan Thomas, when he learnt he was to return to the square. He added that the first person he phoned with the news was former co-star Natalie Cassidy, who plays Sonia Fowler.
