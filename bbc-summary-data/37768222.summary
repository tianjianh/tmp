The 21-year-old made his league debut for the Seagulls as a substitute in the 1-0 win over Burton in September.
Hunt came through the Championship club's youth academy and has made a total of four senior appearances.
"Ultimately, we will look for an opportunity to get him out on loan," Albion manager Chris Hughton said.
