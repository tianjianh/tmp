"What I find depressing about the current debate at present is that everyone seems to think it is absolutely obvious what the answer is - the only thing is half of them seem to think we should stay in and the other half think we should leave," said Lord King.
People want to be given the arguments and the facts so they can make up their own minds, he explained, adding that this was not possible, if the campaign takes the form of slogans and PR.
Lord King said he had not made up his own mind over the referendum.
