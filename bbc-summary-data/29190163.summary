The Frenchman turned sharply into Heidfeld as they battled on the final lap, allowing Audi Sport's Lucas Di Grassi to triumph.
"I feel very bad about the incident... I understand that I am responsible," Prost wrote on Twitter.
Prost has been handed a 10-place grid penalty for the next round in Malaysia.
Pole-sitter Prost initially accused ex-F1 driver Heidfeld of making a "suicide move" but backtracked after watching a video of the incident.
"I just did not see him. I feel very bad," Prost added.
"The most important thing is that my friend Nick Heidfield is OK, sorry again Nick, you know I would never do something like this."

Venturi driver Heidfield welcomed Prost's apology, adding that he accepted his rival would not "drive anybody off on purpose".
The two drivers are team-mates at Rebellion Racing in the World Endurance Championship and are due to compete together at the next round of that series in Austin next week.
The crash paved the way for Brazilian Di Grassi to come through for an unexpected win.
Frank Montagny was runner-up for the Andretti team, while Britain's Sam Bird finished third for Virgin Racing.
There was disappointment for Bruno Senna - nephew of the late Ayrton Senna, the great rival of Nicolas Prost's father Alain - who failed to record a lap in qualifying after battery problems.
Forced to start from near the back of the grid, he collided with another car during the opening lap.
Another son of an F1 great, Nelson Piquet Jnr, came eighth.
Di Grassi, meanwhile, was left to reflect on his good fortune after being gifted the win on a circuit located just outside the Bird's Nest Stadium, site of the 2008 Olympics.
"When I realised that they were off it was like a dream come true," he said. "I was alone and have won the race, and I am really, really really happy to be in this position."
The 10-race season concludes in London's Battersea Park next June.
