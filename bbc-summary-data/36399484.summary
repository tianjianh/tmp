Text service launched to cut nuisance calls to mobiles

A new service has been launched that allows mobile phone users to block nuisance calls by sending a simple text.

From Friday, owners can register with the Telephone Preference Service (TPS) by texting "TPS" and their email address to 78070.
That should stop many nuisance calls, although it won't block nuisance texts.
At the moment 85% of UK landlines are registered for the TPS, but only 3% of mobiles have been signed up.
Those who register will receive a confirmation message. They can then expect a gradual reduction in unsolicited sales and marketing calls after a few days.
However, it can take up to 28 days for the service to become fully effective, according to the regulator, Ofcom.
Sending the text will be free for some users, but not everyone.
"Texting will make it easier for people to register their mobile numbers on the TPS, which is the only official no-call list, and help us stamp out rogue callers once and for all," said John Mitchison, head of the TPS.
The Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) currently receives 175,000 complaints about nuisance calls every year.
Last year one claims management company in South Wales made 40 million nuisance calls about PPI claims, and had its licence suspended.
Laws to stop unwanted sales and marketing calls were tightened in April 2015. Firms that do not display their number when calling can be fined up to Â£500,000.
