Hull City manager Steve Bruce says he does not know for certain if he will still be in charge of the club at the start of the new Premier League season.

Hull's owners are trying to sell the club, while Bruce has also been linked with the vacant England manager's job.
The 55-year-old said in June he would stay with the club, but he admitted new owners could replace him when asked if he was certain of his position.
"I really don't know that. I'm quietly confident," he said.
"If that's not the case and the club can get better then I'll accept it like a big boy and that's football, it happens.
"Any potential buyer would need to have deep pockets to compete in the Premier League. We've just seen two giants of clubs, Newcastle and Aston Villa, slip out of it, so we know how difficult it is.
"So let's hope that if they come, then that can move the club forward. If the club moves forward and is bigger and better, even if that's without me, then so be it."
Bruce is one of the outsiders to take over as England boss, but has been backed by BBC pundit Alan Shearer as his favourite to replace Roy Hodgson.
The former Manchester United midfielder, who was never capped by England, said he was flattered to be linked with the job, but said no approach had been made.
"I think the top of the FA in my opinion should be English. I've always said that, there's nobody more patriotic than I am," he told BBC Radio Humberside.
"If they're going to go English it's highly flattering and I'm honoured to be linked with it.
"It's the pinnacle to go and manage your country. What bigger job in the world is there?"
