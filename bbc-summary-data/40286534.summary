[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man who was tied up by his sexual partner and left with a gas mask on his face died as a result of an "awful, tragic accident", a court has heard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Dohoon Kim, 36, was found dead on the bedroom floor after meeting friend Kevin Adams, 52, at Mr Adams' home in Swindon for sex in June 2015.
Bristol Crown Court heard the pair had taken drugs before engaging in "extreme" sexual activity.
Mr Adams denies manslaughter by failing to ensure safety and wellbeing.
The court heard Mr Adams, of Exmouth Street, Swindon, met Mr Kim on a dating website two years earlier.
Jurors heard that in the early hours of 12 June, Mr Adams called 999 saying Mr Kim, from Slough, Berkshire, was unresponsive and not breathing.
When paramedics arrived, they found Mr Kim had been dead for some time with a gas mask to one side of him and a pile of ropes and restraints nearby.
Pavlos Panayi QC, representing Mr Adams, said his client had not chosen to fall asleep but had "passed out" due to drugs and physical exhaustion.
"Kim died as a result of what everyone in this case will agree is a terrible, awful, tragic accident," he told the jury.
He said the pair "met to have sex" and had taken the drugs and "had the same kind of fun" in the past.
"They had met 12 times before. This was the awful, unlucky 13th time."
A post-mortem examination found Mr Kim had an "excessive" level of mephedrone - sometimes known as M-Cat - in his body, prosecutor Adam Feest told the jury.
Mr Feest said Mr Adams failed to remove the gas mask or restraints or check the condition of Mr Kim, who was left lying on the floor, before he went to sleep.
"Many things that could have been done that could have been potentially lifesaving but not done in this case," he added.
The case continues.
