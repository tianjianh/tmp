Third of Londoners cannot afford basic costs, charity warns

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A third of Londoners cannot afford a decent standard of living, a report has found.

The charity Trust for London defined "decent" as being able to afford food, shelter, clothing and items such as a child's birthday present or a cheap meal out up to twice a month.
Researchers asked 21 groups of between six and eight people about their living standards.
It compared their answers to the rest of the UK.
Research by Loughborough University found it costs some people 50% more in the city to reach an acceptable living standard compared to the rest of the country.
It said a single person in Inner London spent Â£410 a week to live, including housing and childcare, Â£130 more than the UK average.
The research concluded more expensive food, travel and rent in the capital all added to the total.
However, it did also indicate the minimum cost of clothes, household goods, and toiletries is similar across the country.
But, housing, childcare and transport costs in London had risen sharply since 2008, the study said.
Mubin Haq, director of policy and grants at Trust for London, said: "This is not about just food, clothing and having a roof over your head. It's about the difference between people being able to participate in society or not.
"It raises important questions about whether London is for everyone or does it become a city for the wealthiest?"
Mr Haq said a two-pronged approach was needed to tackle low incomes and the high costs of housing, transport and childcare.
The trust said although the average wage is higher in London, the difference between salaries across the UK and London decreases the further down the income scale you go.
