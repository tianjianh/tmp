The 20-year-old was part of the Cherries side that lost at Millwall in the FA Cup last week, but is yet to make a league appearance.
"I've had a couple of people watch their games and their reports have been good," Gulls boss Kevin Nicholson said.
"They've got a very good history of players coming through and they want them out to get that experience."
Torquay have also extended the loan spell of AFC Wimbledon winger David Fitzpatrick until the middle of February.
The 21-year-old has scored two goals in his last three games.
