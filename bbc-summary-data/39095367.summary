The 24-year-old, who was from the Newtownards area, died after an assault at a house on Bangor Road in the town at about 05:30 GMT.
Mr Miskelly was found lying on the road. He was treated by ambulance staff but died at the scene a short time later.
Two 19-year-old men arrested on suspicion of murder remain in custody.
Mr Miskelly's body was still at the scene at lunchtime, when reporter Kevin Sharkey spoke to the BBC's Sunday News programme.
"There is a police forensic tent about 50m off the main Bangor Road," he said.
"A number of entrances along this road have been cordoned off.
"Police are still there, as are forensics experts who are working around the scene in very difficult weather conditions."
The reporter said there had been "torrential rain" in the area at around noon on Sunday.
Police said a post mortem examination would be carried out to help determine the cause of death.
The officer leading the investigation, Det Ch Insp Justyn Galloway, said the incident had "resulted in the tragic death of a young man".
"I would like to thank the local community for their support in this investigation," he said.
"I would appeal to anyone who has any information that they think could help but hasn't yet contacted us to get in touch with detectives."
