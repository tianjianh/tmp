Flt Lt Jon Egging, 33, died when his Hawk T1 jet crashed after completing a display at the annual festival in 2011.
His mother will attend the opening of the air show later this morning, with a ceremony also planned at his memorial.
Red 4 was one of nine Red Arrows aircraft that had earlier taken part in a display over the seafront.
The ceremony, on the anniversary of the crash on Saturday, will see ribbons tied on to the memorial sculpture on Bournemouth's East Overcliff.
Dawn Egging said: "I'm delighted that Jon's memory is being celebrated at the sculpture in such a poignant way.
"I only wish Jon could be here to see what has been realised in his name - he would absolutely love it and be so proud."
The memorial is currently behind barriers after a stretch of East Cliff fell away in April.
Speaking on BBC Radio Solent, Mrs Egging said the 5m-high artwork which features three glass Red Arrows planes and stainless steel contrails is to be moved to a new site.
She said: "We are working closely with the council to find an alternative site.
"The sadness is the position its in now is very significant because of the way the display is structured, so we need to find somewhere equally significant."
Following his death, the Jon Egging Trust (JET) was set up by his widow, Dr Emma Egging, his mother Dawn, childhood friend James Godley, and former Red Arrows team-mate Ben Plank.
The trust runs two youth programmes - Blue Skies an aviation-themed project aimed at helping engage young people, and Inspirational Outreach which offers visits and motivational talks at schools by former pilots and serving military personnel.
A Red Arrows spokeswoman said the team would be performing their full display at the festival at 15:45 BST on all four days, but warned the display was dependent on the weather.
