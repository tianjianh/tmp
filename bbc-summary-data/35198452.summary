Thousands of drug cases unsolved due to cuts, say Scottish Labour

Thousands of drug cases remain unsolved due to cuts in forensic service, according to Scottish Labour.

MSP Graeme Pearson said the Scottish Police Authority (SPA) Forensic Services currently have 2,500 unsolved drugs cases.
Mr Pearson, the former director general of the Scottish Crime and Drug Enforcement Agency, said it could take a year to clear the backlog.
A Scottish government spokeswoman said the claims were "misleading".
Mr Pearson, Scottish Labour's justice spokesman, said: "People need to know the police will be there when they call and that cases will be dealt with swiftly."
He said the number of full-time equivalent (FTE) police support staff working in forensic services had fallen by nearly 50 (almost 10%) since 2011, while the budget had been cut by more than Â£350,000 since 2007.
"Scottish Labour want to reform the system so that the needs of the victims are put first. An investigation dragging on can only add to a victim's anxiety" he said.
"The SNP say we should judge them on their record. Their record on forensics is one of staffing cuts and stalled cases."
But the Scottish government said drugs cases were being dealt with efficiently, making maximum use of Scotland's world-class forensic services.
A government spokeswoman said: "The SPA works closely with Police Scotland, the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service to manage the testing of drugs and prioritise cases appropriately.
"We have invested Â£73m to create the Scottish Crime Campus at Gartcosh and Scotland now has one of the leading DNA facilities in Europe as a direct result of that investment."
The SPA said the demand for forensic science drugs services was increasing with a growing complexity on analysis with the rise of psychoactive substances otherwise known as "legal highs".
A spokesman for the SPA said legal highs accounted for 10% of drugs submitted for testing compared with only 1% just a few years ago.
"The Scottish Police Authority has to work within the public spending challenges all public bodies face but the revenue budget for forensics in 2015-16 has seen a slight increase this year" he said.
