South Yorkshire Police officers were called to Queen Mary Road at about 16:00 BST on Saturday after a gun was fired in the street.
No one was injured but it caused "damage to the window of a nearby house", officers said.
The force said it had started an investigation and would be carrying out extra patrols in the area to reassure local residents.
Detectives have appealed for witnesses to come forward.
