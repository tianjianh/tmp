After an inconsistent group stage, England bowled out semi-final opponents South Africa for 175 on their way to a dominant seven-wicket victory.
"I hope we are peaking," the 32-year-old batsman said. "There's a lot of cricket left this summer, and I hope it will be a great one for England."

The Ashes series starts on 10 July.
England began their Champions Trophy campaign with an impressive 48-run win against upcoming Test opponents Australia, before a seven-wicket defeat by a Kumar Sangakkara-inspired Sri Lanka put their knockout stage qualification hopes in the balance.
A tense rain-affected 10-run win against New Zealand followed in their final Group A fixture, with South Africa then being comprehensively beaten in the last four.
"It's been a fantastic tournament [for England], with regards to coming back from a loss against Sri Lanka," Trott reflected.
"We had the high of beating Australia first up, and then the game against New Zealand - a tight one in the end, but I thought we played really well - and to beat South Africa at The Oval was a great performance."
With the first of two back-to-back Ashes Test series against Australia beginning at Trent Bridge in less than a month, Warwickshire batsman Trott said a win in the Champions Trophy decider at Edgbaston - his home ground - would be the ideal preparation.

He told BBC Radio 5 live: "It would be sort of having your cake and eating it. It is an amazing opportunity to play five games and win a Champions Trophy.
"We deserve to be in the final. We have played some good cricket, under pressure as well. India are a fantastic team, so we have to play our A-game."
England toured India in the winter, sealing their first Test series victory there in 27 years.
But in the last two one-day series between the sides, both in India, the hosts have won 5-0 and 3-2.
In September 2011, England won the last one-day international series played in England against India 3-0.
