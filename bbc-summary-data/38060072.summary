[SN]TITLE[SN]
Sutton United 0-6 Dover Athletic

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Moses Emmanuel scored a hat-trick as Dover extended their National League winning run to four matches by thrashing 10-man Sutton at Gander Green Lane.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Ricky Miller opened the scoring just seven minutes in with a header at the far post before the hosts were reduced to 10 men when Dean Beckwith was shown a straight red card midway through the first half.
Summer signing Emmanuel was on target with his first just after the half-hour mark as his close-range effort doubled Dover's score.
Ross Lafayette then added a third and Emmanuel collected a misplaced pass to fire beyond Sutton goalkeeper Ross Worner on the stroke of half-time to make it 4-0.
The 27-year-old completed his first hat-trick for the club as he chipped the ball past Worner to claim his eighth goal of the season after 53 minutes, and Miller wrapped up the scoring with 20 minutes remaining as the visitors moved up a spot into fifth.
