[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
David Lee Stewart, from Grays Park Avenue in Belfast, appeared at Belfast Crown Court on Tuesday.
He pleaded guilty to a total of five charges arising from an incident which claimed the life of the 18-year old.
The architecture student from Killyclogher, County Tyrone, was in his first year at Queen's University.
He was walking along the Malone Road to his student accommodation when he was struck by a white van, driven by Stewart, in October 2014.
On Tuesday, Stewart admitted causing Mr Dolan's death by dangerous driving, as well as four other motoring offences, including dangerous driving and failing to provide a specimen of blood.
Stewart's defence barrister asked that a pre-sentence report be compiled on his client ahead of sentencing.
He will be remanded in custody until sentencing.
