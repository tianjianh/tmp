[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Alastair Main, 35, attacked her at the London Rowing Club in Putney, south-west London, in December 2015.
His trial heard how he called the woman a "slut" and referenced her nationality after she refused to hug him.
The former England rower was also told to sign the sex offenders register.
Main, who was convicted earlier this month of one count of racially-aggravated assault and one of sexual assault, will be on the register for five years.
Main, from Kingston, south-west London, was sacked from his job as a solicitor at investment firm Schroders two days after he was convicted at Wimbledon Magistrates' Court.
Magistrates were told he had smacked the woman about five times on the backside after following her into the ladies' toilets.
She told the court that during the night out on 16 December his demeanour changed after he overheard her talking about her plans for the evening.
She said: "Something had snapped, and there was this anger about him."
Defending, Eloise Marshall told the court that Main, father to an eight-week-old baby and the family breadwinner, had lost his job, sold his car and would most likely have to sell his home.
District Judge Barbara Barnes made him the subject of a restraining order, banning him from contacting the woman for five years.
She also also ordered him to carry out 200 hours of unpaid work and pay Â£1,000 in court costs.
