Financial forecasts for the Crichton Estate in Dumfries are predicting a significant leap in profits.

The site is home to higher and further education institutions, business premises and conference facilities.
Draft figures from the Crichton Trust, which runs the estate, show turnover of £2.6m and a net profit of £20,000 for the financial year 2015/16.
Its budget for 2016/17 predicts turnover to rise by £500,000 and profit to increase to £323,000.
The figures will be reported to Dumfries and Galloway Council's Crichton sub committee when it meets on 10 June.
It will also receive a progress report on plans to develop the estate.
It highlights a £40,000 profit forecast for a new spa, bistro, restaurant and bar which opened last year.
The report also flags up increased costs for a proposal to create a visitor centre in the crypt of the Crichton Memorial Church after preparatory works revealed the need for further works.
Talks are ongoing about plans for the number of student residences on the site.
Universities and colleges on site are said to be "reviewing their curriculum offering" which could see the need for accommodation change.
The potential for the Scottish Rural College to relocate its operations to the site could also have an impact.
