The victim had been on a number 3 Lothian bus, which was travelling east along Princes Street at about 17:00 on Friday, when the man started causing a disturbance.
Both men got off the bus outside the Apple store and the 27-year-old was punched in the face.
As he walked up Waterloo Place towards Regent Road he was hit on the head.
He noticed that the same man from the previous disturbance was responsible.
The suspect then ran off up the steps towards Calton Hill.
The suspect was described as being black, in his early 20s, 5ft 11in tall, of slim build. He was wearing a white baseball cap with a red brim and a white top with blue diagonal stripes on the shoulders.
Police have asked anyone who can help to identify him to come forward.
Det Sgt Neil Spowart said: "We believe this attack stemmed from the victim's involvement in trying to stop the suspect causing a disturbance on the bus and are keen to hear from other passengers who were on-board at the time.
"In addition, members of the public who witnessed the altercation outside the Apple store or the second assault on Regent Road are also asked to contact police immediately."
In a separate incident, a 36-year-old man was seriously assaulted in the Allan Terrace area of Woodburn, Dalkeith, at about 16:50 on Friday.
The man received a number of cuts to his arm and back and an injury to his ear.
He was treated by ambulance staff but declined hospital treatment.
Police said inquiries to establish the full circumstances of the assault were ongoing and asked anyone with information to contact them.
Det Insp Paul Batten said: "At this time, we are trying to determine the full nature of this attack and establish who was involved.
"I would ask anyone who believes they saw anything suspicious in the Allan Terrace area on Friday afternoon to contact police immediately."
