[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Shrewsbury eased their relegation fears with a vital League One victory over fellow strugglers Bury.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Goals from Tyler Roberts and Freddie Ladapo, two strikers on loan from Premier League clubs, gave Shrewsbury breathing space before Jacob Mellis pulled a late goal back for Bury.
The visitors started brightly and James Vaughan's early header was comfortably saved by goalkeeper Jayson Leutwiler before a half-volley from Vaughan, Bury's top scorer, drifted wide.
Reece Brown then lifted a shot just over for the Shakers before Shrewsbury started to carve out opportunities.
Junior Brown exchanged passes with Alex Rodman and fired over from 20 yards before two chances fell the way of lively winger Shaun Whalley in quick succession.
Whalley cut into the box from the right and Bury goalkeeper Rob Lainton did well to dive low to his right to save a well-struck shot.
Whalley then unleashed a volley from the edge of the penalty area which was straight at Lainton.
Shrewsbury took the lead in the 47th minute when Roberts, on loan from West Brom, was picked out by a cross from Brown and the striker rifled home a powerful low shot from 15 yards.
Ladapo then fired wide of the near post and Toto Nsiala's header was nodded off the line by Vaughan before the hosts doubled their advantage in the 77th minute.
A shot from Roberts was blocked and substitute Ladapo, on loan from Crystal Palace, pounced to turn in the loose ball from close range.
Bury cut the arrears in the 87th minute, substitute Mellis slotting in after Leutwiler was unable to claim a cross, but Shrewsbury were not to be denied as they extended their unbeaten run to five games.
