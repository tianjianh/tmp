Fabrice Bregier said he was committed to its UK workers which includes 6,000 at its wing-making factory in Broughton, Flintshire.
His comments come after the UK boss of Airbus said it would reconsider future investment in the event of an EU-exit.
The referendum will not take place next 5 May, the government says.
At the Paris Air Show, Mr Bregier did say that in a new post-referendum environment, he would have to make a judgement about what the consequences would be for the competitiveness of his business.
