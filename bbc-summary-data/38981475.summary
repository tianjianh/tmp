Hartlepool midfielder Brad Walker says he was happy to change his role to centre-back and enjoys seeing the "whole picture" of the game.

Walker, 21, had to switch his position following an injury to defender Matt Bates after just 14 minutes of the 3-0 defeat by Luton Town on Tuesday.
The change was not something manager Dave Jones had spoken about previously.
"It's the first I knew of it," Walker told BBC Tees. "But as long as I'm on the pitch, I couldn't care less."
Hartlepool were 2-0 down to goals from Danny Hylton and Luke Gambin before Walker was moved into defence, with Ollie Palmer adding the third nine minutes before the end.
"I thought I did ok," added Walker. "With my physique, I should not be getting bullied in the air.
"With the people in the team and midfield, we didn't have another centre-half on the bench. I thought my physique and stature would go well at the back and I'd just slot in."
Hartlepool have only one win in eight League Two games so far in 2017, and have conceded 14 goals in those matches.
"We can say all we want about how well we played, but we need to start winning games and doing it quickly," said Walker.
