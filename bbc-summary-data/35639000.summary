Bath electric cars: Broken charging points to be replaced

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Some electric car charging points in Bath are to be replaced following complaints from drivers they do not work.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Several public charging points in the city, which are owned by Bath and North East Somerset (Banes) Council, have recently been reported as broken.
One driver told the BBC "only three of about 15" were working last week.
Banes said it was "aware of some issues" and it planned to install new units by the end of March.
The BBC found at least three charging stations - at Charlotte Street car park, and at Lansdown and Newbridge park and rides - were currently out of service.
Electric car owner Will Guyatt said: "To find a public charge point is not working, you really are stuffed, because you then need to find somewhere else to charge."
Calvey Taylor-Haw, from Charge Your Car - which oversees charging points in the UK, said there had been problems in Bath for a while.
"We've had numerous calls about those particular charging stations and they are very unreliable.
"We've taken the decision to mark them as 'off-line' on our map."
Erik Fairbairn from the charging point supplier POD Point, which supplied many of the machines in the city, said reliability was "not perfect" and said discussions were taking place with the council about upgrading them.
"These were charge points sold a number of years ago to the council. They haven't necessarily had the relevant support contract in place.
"Now a number of them are not perfect. We're hoping the council will say 'come in and sort them out'."
A council spokesman said Banes was "in the process of switching its supplier and replacing electric charging points" in the Charlotte Street car park and Lansdown park and ride.
