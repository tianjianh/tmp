Guernsey's head of cricket Ashley Wright says the island must send a side to the Sussex League next season.

Guernsey Sarnians won three and lost four of their 10 matches in the Sussex Cricket League's Second Division this summer, the first time a Channel Island side has played in an English league.
"It's an absolutely priceless experience," Wright told BBC Guernsey.
"If we can take a development team there, mixed with a few of the senior guys, then I think we have to go."
Wright took over as the head of cricket last December, after the decision to join the Sussex League had been made.
He was initially sceptical of the move, but says last weekend's performances have persuaded him it is right to carry on.
"If I look at the team that I'm looking to get forward, there are potentially five lads who have been exposed to cricket that they never would have done," he said.
"It's changed my opinion from midway through the season to the end of the season.
"It was absolutely brilliant the way the boys gelled together and the learning they got from the experience and we put up a really good fight."
