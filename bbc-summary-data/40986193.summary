Vehicles have been left dangling from the edge of a city centre car park after it partially collapsed.

Part of a wall came away at the NCP Nottingham City site in Cumberland Place shortly after 04:00 BST.
A spokesman for NCP said the front facia had "fallen" and road closures were in place.
Structural engineers are at the scene assessing the situation. No-one was injured in the collapse.
George Cook, of Scunthorpe, had parked his car at the site and was staying nearby.
"I heard a bang at about 03:30 BST," he said.
"I was not sure what it was, I looked out the window, but couldn't see anything.
"I came back and cars were over hanging the car park. It was a bit of a shock. Thankfully one was not mine."
The spokesman for the NCP said staff were on site helping any customers who had cars inside the building.
It is not yet known when the car park will reopen, but people are being allowed in to collect their cars.
A spokesman for Nottingham City Council said as it is a privately-owned car park the council was not involved in the investigation.
