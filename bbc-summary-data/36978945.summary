"The Olympics is one of the highest-profile sporting events in the world, and is a tremendous opportunity to compete against the best sportsmen and women in the world.
"I will be cheering on all of them throughout the games and I hope that the hard work and dedication these athletes have put in will pay off."
Ms Sturgeon said she wished the Scottish Olympians and the whole of Team GB the "very best of luck".
