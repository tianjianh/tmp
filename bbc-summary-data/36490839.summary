The Coleraine rowers were medallists in London four years ago.
Peter Chambers is selected men's lightweight four for Rio while Richard partners Will Fletchers in the Lightweight Double Scull.
Meanwhile, Hillsborough's Clare Abbott has been named in the Ireland Eventing Team for the Olympics.
The 29-year-old will ride chestnut gelding Europrince at the Rio Games.
Campbell, who won bronze in 2012, is delighted to make history as Northern Ireland's first four-time Olympian.
"I feel very honoured, it's very special and I'm just so happy," said Campbell.
"Sport is something very special in Northern Ireland and to carry the flag for a fourth time is unbelievable.
"The Olympics is the pinnacle, what makes all those horrible mornings, driving snow and sleet worthwhile.
"It brings together the best of the best and I'm glad I will be there once again."
