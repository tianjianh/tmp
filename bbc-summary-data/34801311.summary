Rotherham Council selects new chief executive candidate

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Rotherham Council has announced its preferred candidate for the role of its new chief executive.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Sharon Kemp, currently strategic director at Manchester City Council, is expected to take up the Â£160,000 position from March.
The council's elected members have until Monday to give reasons on why a formal offer should not be made.
Government commissioners currently run the council after a report over its handling of child sexual exploitation.
The five commissioners replaced the cabinet in February following the Casey Report's criticism of its woeful response to child exploitation.
Last year the Jay Report found 1,400 children had been subjected to abuse.
The authority said it had received 15 applications and Ms Kemp was chosen following a "rigorous assessment process", with final interviews on Wednesday.
She has worked at Manchester City Council since 2009, and before that was assistant chief executive at Haringey Council in the aftermath of the Baby P case.
Ms Kemp, who was born and lives in Lancashire, said she looked forward to working with Rotherham Council to "make a positive difference".
