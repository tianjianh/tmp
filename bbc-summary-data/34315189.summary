BTP said the collision was "accidental" and no-one else was involved.
The injured man, who is 56 and from Crewe, remains in hospital with damage to his legs and back.
It happened as tens of thousands of fans left Twickenham Stadium on Friday after England's victory over Fiji.
The train had been slowing at the time the man was hit.
BTP said crowd control was not an issue and no-one was touching the man when he fell.
Services between Twickenham and London Waterloo were suspended while the man was treated but later resumed.
A spokeswoman for South West Trains said: "Our immediate thoughts are for the welfare of the person involved."
The train company added that it had 50 staff at Twickenham station on Friday and a queuing system was in operation.
The station in south-west London was evacuated while the man was treated. The ambulance service said he was later taken to St George's Hospital.
