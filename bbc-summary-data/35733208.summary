Dagenham manager John Still told BBC Radio London: "We started slowly, but once we got that out of the way I thought in the first half we were the dominant team.
"It's about both boxes. We didn't defend our box well enough in the early part of the game and found ourselves 2-0 down.
"I was delighted with our response, we got the goal back and I thought finished the second half in the ascendancy."
