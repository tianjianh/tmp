General election 2017: Ken Clarke to stand again

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Former Conservative chancellor Ken Clarke is to stand again to be an MP in the 8 June general election.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Mr Clarke, who has represented Rushcliffe in Nottinghamshire since 1970, had suggested he would step down in 2020 after 50 years as an MP.
But with an early poll confirmed by MPs, his office confirmed the 76-year-old would stand again.
Mr Clarke, a staunch Remain supporter, is Father of the House - an honour bestowed on the longest-serving MP.
Speaking in June 2016 to China Daily, Mr Clarke said: "I have told the officers of my constituency association that once we have finished the boundary changes they had better start choosing my successor.
"I will not stand again. This is my last Parliament."
However, a general election will take place sooner than expected after MPs gave the go-ahead to Theresa May's request for an early poll.
And Mr Clarke's office confirmed: "He's putting himself forward to be the Conservative candidate for Rushcliffe in June."
