A number of law firms have come under fire for their "bad taste" adverts in the wake of a crash at Alton Towers.

Four people were badly injured as two carriages collided on the Smiler ride on Tuesday.
Solicitors Broad Yorkshire Law, based in Sheffield, posted a message on Twitter on Tuesday, but quickly removed it.
The firm apologised, blaming a junior member of staff, who has been reprimanded.
Lois Bayliss, of Broad Yorkshire Law, said she did not blame people for being "horrified" at the tweet and that it "would never try to profit in such a way from such a terrible accident".
The advert was described by one Facebook user as "insensitive, tactless, inconsiderate, thoughtless, cold, unsympathetic, heartless and callous".
Solicitors Molesworths Bright-Clegg, based in Rochdale, tweeted a similar message, but has since removed it.
The firm apologised, saying: "We jumped the gun trying to be topical before knowing how serious things were.
"It's obvious now we reacted too quickly without checking all the facts. As stated above, we unreservedly apologise to anyone who took offence at our tweet and, again, send everyone involved in the accident our best wishes for a speedy recovery."
One Twitter user, Karl Gunton, said he had been blocked by the business after complaining about its "bad taste".
Cohen Cramer Solicitors, based in Leeds, also took to Twitter to apologise.
While its original post was deleted, it tweeted: "Apologies to all concerned - it was crass and insensitive and we unreservedly apologise for the offence  it undoubtedly caused #AltonTowers."
Meanwhile, Norwich City goalkeeper John Ruddy has apologised after a joke appeared on his Twitter account about the accident. He claimed his account was hacked after the post appeared hours after the crash.
It read: "Buzzing for @altontowers next weekend...at least I won't need a fast pass for smiler!"
The Alton Towers hashtag has been used thousands of times in the last 24 hours, with many people following news of the crash on Twitter.
Two men, 27 and 18, a woman, 19, and a girl, 17, suffered serious leg injuries and were trapped along with other passengers on the ride for several hours.
They are currently being treated at nearby trauma centres.
Alton Towers was closed on Wednesday while an investigation continues into the crash.
