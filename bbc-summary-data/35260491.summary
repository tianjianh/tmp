PC Dave Phillips: Clayton Williams denies officer's murder

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An 18-year-old man has denied murdering a Merseyside Police officer who died after being struck by a vehicle.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
PC Dave Phillips, 34, died after a pick-up truck mounted a central reservation in Wallasey, Merseyside, in October last year.
Appearing at Liverpool Crown Court, Clayton Williams, of Wheatland Lane, Wallasey, denied PC Phillips's murder and attempting to wound his colleague.
Mr Williams is due to stand trial at Manchester Crown Court on 7 March.
Married father-of-two PC Phillips had been responding to reports of a burglary in Woodchurch Road, Birkenhead, when he died in the early hours of 5 October.
He and a colleague had been attempting to stop a vehicle using a tyre-puncturing "stinger" device, police said.
Fellow officers tried to save his life before he was rushed to hospital, but he died shortly after arrival.
PC Phillips' widow Jen attended the hearing.
