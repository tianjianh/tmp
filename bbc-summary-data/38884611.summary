[SN]TITLE[SN]
Aberdeen City Council warns of £21.5m cuts and staff reduction

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Aberdeen City Council has warned it faces making cuts of more than £21.5m.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
It could mean the number of staff may have to be reduced by about 200, although the local authority is hoping to avoid compulsory redundancies.
The authority could generate money by raising Council Tax.
However no final decision has been taken on that option.
