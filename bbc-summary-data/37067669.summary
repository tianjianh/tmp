[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Newport rescued a point against Crewe Alexandra thanks to summer signing Sean Rigg.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Rigg headed home Jazzi Barnum-Bobb's cross to earn parity for Warren Feeney's side.
The visitors made a strong start at a sodden Rodney Parade, which hosted a Wales women international on Friday evening.
Chelsea loanee Alex Kiwomya put Crewe ahead in the first period after cutting inside and smashing home.
Marlon Jackson missed a late chance to earn all three points for the hosts.
Newport County manager Warren Feeney told BBC Radio Wales Sport: "I am pleased with a point but also disappointed, but we gave ourselves a mountain to climb in the first half.
"We conceded a silly goal, we should deal with it better, but in the second half we camped in their half and dug deep and we are disappointed not to win it.
"Last season, we would have lost that game. There is good character here now."
