How much news can you report in 60 seconds? Five students find out

How many news stories can you fit into 60 seconds?

That was our task when we went to New Broadcasting House in London to produce and record a special edition of the BBC Minute on School Report News Day.
On our news agenda: Rhino poaching, missiles, 3D video games, grumpiness, and a cat in a washing machine.
We met Jonathan Richards, who is in charge of BBC Minute, which goes out internationally and is produced by the World Service team.
First we had an editorial meeting to decide what things we would put into the minute. Some of the stories already had a script prepared so we read those out.
We had to write the script for the story about how grumpiness could shorten your life. "It was difficult to keep the script very short," says Charlotte. "We had to pick out two main points."
Mr Richards is going to edit our programme into one minute and give us a copy.
"It will be weird hearing our voices back," says Charley. "But we're looking forward to listening to it."
Some of us were also interviewed on camera by Tony Hall, the BBC director-general. He asked us why we were here and what we had enjoyed.
We told him it was a great experience to come to the BBC and that we enjoyed everything.
After all the hard work of making a programme, we had a tour of the BBC and even saw the gallery for BBC London television.
We think the BBC is one of the most desirable places to work - it looks fun!
The students are all part of the Erith School Radio Club, which they were inspired to set up after taking part in BBC School Report News Day in 2015. They managed to persuade their head teacher to fund the project.
