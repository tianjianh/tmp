Motorcycle injuries and deaths at seven-year high

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The number of motorcyclists killed or injured on roads in Wales has risen for the fourth year in a row and is at a seven-year high, official figures show.

Incidents recorded by the police reveal 28 people died in 2014, up from 17 in 2013 - but the figure is only slightly higher than the previous three years.
The total number of those killed, seriously or slightly injured in 2014 was 749 - the highest for seven years.
Road safety campaigners called the figures "disappointing".
Dave Nichols, spokesman for road safety charity Brake, said: "Every road casualty causes appalling suffering, and every one can be prevented, but only if we make the right moves.
"Everyone who uses the road has a responsibility to look out for each other, whether a rider or driver, and make sure we slow down and keep well within the limits.
"Politicians can also play their part by lowering the default speed limit on country roads from 60 to 50mph, and even lower where there are particular risks."
The Welsh government said it was committed to improving road safety and had awarded nearly Â£4m to 30 road safety improvement schemes in 14 local authority areas.
It has also given Â£180,000 to help motorcyclists improve their skills.
A spokesman added: "Our road safety framework identifies measures to protect the most high risk and vulnerable road users, however, everyone has a part to play and needs to take some responsibility."
Chris Hume, of Wales' road casualty reduction partnership GoSafe, said: "The continuing overall drop in fatal and serious injuries across all road user types is encouraging.
"However, with regard to motorcyclists in particular, we want them to enjoy the roads but most of all we want them to ride safely and responsibly."
On Monday, the three Welsh fire services launched a joint road safety strategy,â€‹ which set out how they will support the Welsh government to cut road deaths and injuries.
Chief fire officer for Mid and West Wales Fire and Rescue Service, Chris Davies, said motorcyclists accounted for 37% of those killed or seriously injured on the roads.
That is despite making up just 1% of road traffic in Wales.
He said: "Motorcyclists are not necessarily at fault for collisions, their vulnerability means that they are far more likely to be killed or seriously injured."
Motorcycle deaths made up 22% of those killed or seriously hurt in Wales
Swansea and Powys local authority areas had the most casualties, while Blaenau Gwent, Merthyr and Anglesey had the fewest
Since 2004, about 90% of the casualties have been men
Since 1998, casualties aged over 30 has exceeded the number under 30
