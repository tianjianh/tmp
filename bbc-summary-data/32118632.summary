Officers were called to the Xscape retail park in Castleford where up to 30 men were fighting.
Security staff at the retail park broke up the fight. One man was injured, but not seriously.
West Yorkshire Police said there had been no arrests and appealed for help identifying those involved.
Eyewitness Carl Carritt said: "I was in the soft play area with my son - a three-year-old - and we were looking out of the window.
"We saw it all kicking off, there was fighting in pockets all over. It really was something out of the Wild West - I was shocked.
"It's not an environment I'd be wanting to be taking my son to in the future. We were a bit scared."
Ch Insp Darren Williams said: "Inquiries are ongoing today regarding the circumstances of the fighting at Xscape and officers are also viewing CCTV and available footage on line.
"Clearly this would have been a distressing incident to witness for those attending the leisure park at the time and this sort of behaviour is totally unacceptable and will not tolerated.
"It must also be stressed that this sort of large scale incident is very unusual for the centre.
"I would ask anyone who can help identify those involved, or who has filmed the incident themselves and has footage which they can provide, to contact Sgt Alex Macleod at the Castleford Neighbourhood Policing Team on 101."
In a statement, Xscape Yorkshire said: "We do not tolerate this kind of behaviour at Xscape Yorkshire, and we are working closely with West Yorkshire Police in their investigations of the one-off incident."
