Prison sentences: Plans 'to encourage' early guilty pleas

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
All criminals who plead guilty at the earliest opportunity could have their sentences cut by a third, even if the evidence against them is overwhelming, under new plans in England and Wales.

Currently, judges are able to grant a smaller reduction in such cases.
The Sentencing Council said its plans - now being consulted on - would encourage early guilty pleas and spare more victims the trauma of a trial.
The Ministry of Justice said no decisions had been made.
Under the new draft guidelines, the sliding scale for sentencing reductions would be:
No reduction in sentence would be offered to someone pleading guilty to murder where the judge determines they should receive a whole life jail term.
The Sentencing Council said it recognised that making a one-third reduction mandatory for all offenders pleading guilty as soon as possible was "controversial" and could be seen as an "erosion of judicial discretion".
"There is an understandable reluctance to provide those who are guilty with a 'reward' for pleading guilty, especially when they have little or no prospect of being acquitted," it said.
"However, it is important to recognise that the guilty plea reduction is in place to provide an incentive and not a reward.
"For it to work effectively, it is important that it is a clear and unqualified incentive to the defendant."
The council said the new guidelines provided "a much tighter framework" and "much less scope for offenders to 'play the system' and still receive the maximum discount".
Chairman Lord Justice Treacy said: "We want those who have committed crimes to admit their guilt as early as possible.
"When they do, it means victims and witnesses can be reassured that the offender has accepted responsibility for what they have done and that they are spared having to appear at court to testify.
"It also means that the police and Crown Prosecution Service can use their resources more efficiently to investigate and prosecute other cases."
The council stressed that nothing in the new guidelines "should be taken to suggest that an accused person who is not guilty of an offence should be pressured to plead guilty".
Mark Fenhalls QC, chairman of the Criminal Bar Association, said "clarity and consistency" in sentencing was welcome, but flexibility was also vital.
"There has to be a proper balance between the interests of the public, victims and the rights of defendants to fair process, without undue pressure being placed on defendants who are often vulnerable.
"Defendants who plead guilty early must always receive more credit than those who game the system. But guidelines must not become straitjackets that prevent judges from making the right decision in individual cases."
A Ministry of Justice spokesman said: "The changes in the consultation would lead to stricter sentences as those pleading guilty later in the process will get a smaller reduction.
"There would be no change to the reduction for those pleading guilty at the earliest point in the process.
"Following the spending review, there is no financial need to cut prison numbers over the next five years. Protecting the public will always be our top priority."
The Sentencing Council was set up by Parliament to promote consistency in sentencing while maintaining the independence of the judiciary.
It recommends sentences according to the relative seriousness of different offences, and the seriousness of the offender's behaviour relative to that of others convicted of the same crime.
