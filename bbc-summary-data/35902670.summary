Sunderland 0-0 West Bromwich Albion

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Sunderland remain in the relegation zone after they failed to turn their dominance into goals against West Brom.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Despite a first clean sheet in 17 league games, the Black Cats took only a point, wasting two excellent chances to win the game in the closing minutes.
First Fabio Borini forced a sprawling save from Ben Foster, before the keeper denied Jermain Defoe from five yards.
Then the hosts had a goal disallowed in injury time when Dame N'Doye netted, but was correctly adjudged offside.
It could be a significant missed opportunity for Sunderland, who are now four points from safety after Norwich beat Newcastle.
West Brom - who came closest when an overhit Darren Fletcher free-kick tested Vito Mannone - remain 11th.
Sunderland boss Sam Allardyce will be hugely frustrated, having seen his side pegged back from winning positions in drawing their previous three matches. They finally kept it tight at the back - only to misfire up front.
The Black Cats had 22 shots - their most in a league game this season - hitting the target with seven, but could not find a way past Foster.
Much of the optimism about Sunderland's survival prospects has centred on the goalscoring nous of Jermain Defoe, but after netting in the past two games, the striker endured a poor day.
The 33-year-old had eight shots, but directed only three on target.
In addition to his late chance, he shot wide on the turn when played in by Patrick van Aanholt, and failed to make contact at all when found unmarked eight yards out by Wahbi Khazri's superb cross.

It was a largely lacklustre showing by West Brom, who were perhaps fortunate to earn the point that takes them to the 40-point mark widely presumed to represent safety from relegation.
Their star performer was goalkeeper Ben Foster, who made a number of excellent saves.
It was a complete performance from the 32-year-old, who used every part of his body to deny Sunderland: repelling Defoe's late shot with his feet, sticking up a hand to save a first-half effort from Lee Cattermole and even blocking with his face when Jan Kirchhoff found a way through.
And with back-up England keeper Jack Butland set to miss Euro 2016 after fracturing his ankle against Germany, Foster - who has eight England caps - could hardly have chosen a better moment to remind former Baggies boss Roy Hodgson of his class.
Sunderland manager Sam Allardyce: "It was the best performance since I've been here. It was outstanding, particularly in the second half.
"We controlled the game, we played with composure and huge ability to break a very stubborn defensive unit. We richly deserved the victory, but just couldn't find the back of the net."

West Brom manager Tony Pulis: "I was concerned today, I think the players thought we were safe - but we showed that wherever we go, we're West Bromwich Albion and we give a performance. We must never lose that doggedness that I love as a coach.
"Hopefully [in the summer] we'll be able to bring a few players that will give us a little bit more going forward."
Sunderland face league leaders Leicester next Sunday (16:00 BST), while West Brom visit Manchester City on Saturday (17:30 BST).
