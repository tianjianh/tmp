Arran, Skye, Lewis and Harris among 'best UK islands'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Scottish isles have made it on to a TripAdvisor list of the UK's best islands for travellers compiled from tourists' reviews.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Arran has been put in fourth place, Skye fifth, mainland Orkney sixth and Lewis and Harris joint eighth.
Jersey, a British Crown Dependency, was rated by TripAdvisor as the UK's top island followed by the Isle of Wight and St Mary's in the Isles of Scilly.
No Scottish island made it on to a top 10 list of best European isles.
The top European island was Santorini in Greece.
Jersey is part of the British Isles but not the UK. However, it and other Channel Islands featured in TripAdvisor's search for tourists' favourite UK islands.
Last year, Lewis and Harris were jointly named as the best islands in Europe by the international travel website.
The isles also beat rivals in Thailand, Chile and Madagascar to be included in the site's top five islands in the world in 2014.
Orkney and Mull were also named in the European top 10 last year.
