The 27-year-old was dismissed for shoving Jonathan Viera early in the second half of Wednesday's draw.
The Wales international reacted angrily after he was pushed and received just his second sending off of his career.
Speaking to Real Madrid TV, Bale said: "I don't believe that it was deserving of a red card."
He continued: "I was shown the yellow for the foul, I was then pushed and I just pushed him back. I want to apologise to the team and the fans. I hope to learn from my mistake".
Bale could miss Madrid's three remaining league games prior to the international break later in March but will still be available for Real's Champions League Round of 16 second leg against Napoli on Tuesday.
It was his first sending off since he was red carded in Tottenham Hotspur's 2-1 defeat by Stoke City in October 2008 but he will be available for Wales' World Cup qualifier against the Republic of Ireland in Dublin on 24 March.
"He wasn't happy. Obviously playing with 11 is better but it's part of the game that we cannot change. We have to move on," Real Madrid boss Zinedine Zidane said.
Real goalkeeper Keylor Navas added: "He has spoken to everyone to apologise and he feels bad. We're a united group and we win and lose the games all together. He is part of that and he can't be blamed for anything."
