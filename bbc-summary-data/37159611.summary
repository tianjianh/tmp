Jim Bentley: Morecambe manager plays down good start

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Morecambe must not get carried away despite sitting top of League Two, says Shrimps boss Jim Bentley.

The Shrimps lost their opening game of the season at newly-promoted Grimsby but then knocked Championship side Rotherham out of the EFL Cup 5-4 and have won three straight league games.
"It's nice but it is early days," 40-year-old Bentley told BBC Radio Lancashire.
"You're never too high and never too low and I keep saying that."
He added: "It's important everyone keeps their feet on the ground - likewise when you have a sticky spell that everyone keeps check and sticks together."
Kevin Ellison, 37, got the only goal of the game as Morecambe's 1-0 win at Yeovil on Saturday moved them to the top of the league.
"People say about his age and this and that but if you work with him day in, day out you see how he rubs off on other people," added Bentley on Ellison. "His desire, his attitude towards training and his own recovery and own professionalism, he's a credit to himself and his family.
"A lot of young people should look at him up and down the country because he is that good at what he does."
