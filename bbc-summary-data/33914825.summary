Both phones have 5.7in (14.5cm) screens and are going on sale earlier in the year than their previous generations.
The launches follow five successive falls in Samsung Electronics' quarterly profits.
Analysts say the popularity of mid-range phones from Chinese rivals, and Apple's shift to bigger iPhones, have dented demand for Samsung's devices.
The BBC's New York Business Correspondent Michelle Fleury went hands on with the new devices at the launch event.
