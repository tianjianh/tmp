Farah, 34, said last year that he will focus on marathons after this year's World Championships in London, which run from 4-13 August.
But he will now compete in the Diamond League at the Alexander Stadium in Birmingham on the track on 20 August.
"I'm sure it will be a day I remember for the rest of my life," he said.
Farah won the 5,000m and 10,000m golds at both the London 2012 and Rio 2016 Olympics.
And he will attempt a third successive 5,000m/10,000m double at the World Championships next month.
He ran at the Anniversary Games on Sunday at the London Stadium as he finalised his World Championships preparations with a win the 3,000m with a time of 7:35.15.
The five-time world champion added: "I'll be looking for a good final performance to thank the fans for all their support over the years."
