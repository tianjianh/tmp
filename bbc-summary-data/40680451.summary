Ray Dare died when his bike and a van were involved in a collision on the A41 Ashton Clinton bypass, near Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire, at about 14:45 BST on Wednesday.
He had belonged to the Surrey-based Kingston Phoenix Road Club for more than 60 years.
A statement on the club's website expressed "huge sadness and shock".
It said Mr Dare had been "attempting to set a new national record for a 91-year-old".
A post on the Timetrialling Forum said: "Other riders have spoken of him riding well and steadily before.
"As yet there are no further details but police, of course, are conducting a fatal accident investigation.
"I am sure all riders will be as shocked as the officials were at this news."
Circumstances surrounding the crash are being investigated and Thames Valley Police is appealing for witnesses to come forward.
The driver of the van was uninjured. No arrests have been made.
