The route between Belfast International Airport and Newark is the only direct link between Northern Ireland and the United States.
The service did not operate between 6 January and 11 March this year but will fly three times a week during that period in 2016.
Belfast International Airport said the decision was "wonderful news for Northern Ireland".
Graham Keddie, the airport's managing director, said: "United's commitment is both welcome and substantial.
"We have been working with stakeholders to achieve this outcome and we are delighted it is now being delivered."
Bob Schumacher, United's managing director of sales in the UK and Ireland, said: "We're pleased to offer our Northern Irish customers a year-round direct link to New York."
