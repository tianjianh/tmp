[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Shakespeare Birthplace Trust has voted to sell a small parcel of land near Anne Hathaway's cottage to a housing developer.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Bloor Homes and Hallam Land Management has permission to build 800 homes across two sites in Shottery and link them with a relief road.
Stratford-on-Avon District Council's appeal against the development was turned down by the High Court.
The trust says it will seek further negotiations to protect the setting.
The proposal includes 280 affordable homes, a primary school and a health centre.
Campaign group Save Shottery had called on the trust to stop the development by refusing to sell the land.
But at a meeting on Saturday, trustees agreed in principle to sell for an undisclosed sum.
The board instructed its executive team to enter into further negotiations with the developers including detailed traffic calming measures in Cottage Lane.
Bloor Homes and Hallam Land Development were not immediately available for comment.
