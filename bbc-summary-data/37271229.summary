County Kildare: Body of Philip Finnegan found in woodland

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Irish police have released the name of the man whose remains were found in woods in County Kildare on Friday.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The body of Philip Finnegan, 24, was discovered by people walking in Rahin Woods, near Carbury, at about 20:45 local time.
It was partially buried and covered by undergrowth near two trails through the woods.
Mr Finnegan was reported missing from his home at Mary Aikenhead House in Dublin on 10 August.
Police said a post-mortem examination had been carried out but they would not be releasing any details for operational reasons.
The area where Mr Finnegan's remains were found is still sealed off.
Police had earlier said they believed he may have died violently.
One line of inquiry is that the victim may have had a falling out with gangland criminals over money.
