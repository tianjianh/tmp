She took part in The Daily Show as part of her first official visit to the United States.
Ms Sturgeon began by questioning her billing on the show's website as a "comedian".
She told host Jon Stewart: "You billed me on your website as a comedian - so you've raised all these expectations that I'm going to be funny."
The first minister added: "I'm a politician, and as you know, politicians are rarely very funny."
Stewart explained to the US audience that the SNP had won an "unprecedented" 56 out of 59 seats in Scotland at the general election.
Nicola Sturgeon joked: "I have ordered an inquiry into why the SNP did not win the other three. It's reporting directly to me."
Stewart said: "What do you think you are, Saddam Hussein? You get 99%? 56 out of 59 is pretty good."
Sturgeon said: "Always aim for more."

Ms Sturgeon is on the second day of a four-day trip to America where she is undertaking a series of engagements in New York and Washington.
She followed in the footsteps of Tony Blair and Gordon Brown by making an appearance on the late-night chat show, although the former Labour leaders were interviewed after they left office.
Amid laughter from the audience Stewart reassured Ms Sturgeon she would be fine, saying: "You need not worry. They thought I was going to be funny for 17 years."
Other topics touched on during the broadcast included the SNP's success in the general election, the Edinburgh Fringe Festival and the taste of haggis.
American viewers were generally positive in their reaction to the Scottish first minister's contribution.
US journalist Skylar Baker-Jordan, who covers UK politics, said: "Sturgeon is on top of her game as usual. Insightful, delightful and charming."
Minnesota-based Ashley Follmer tweeted: "I wish America had more delightful politicians such as Scotland's Nicola Sturgeon."
The first minister's engagements for Tuesday include hosting a reception to launch the US fundraising appeal for the Glasgow School of Art.
