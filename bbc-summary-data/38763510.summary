The 23-year-old former Middlesbrough trainee has scored seven goals in 44 matches for the Iron, but has started just one league match this campaign.
He missed three months of this term through injury.
Williams comes in following the season-ending injury to Sam Hoskins and Alex Revell's calf problem.
"I think he is a player who will fit perfectly into the style of play we are implementing," said manager Justin Edinburgh.
"He has some good experience of this level and above, he is a very gifted footballer with plenty of natural ability and he will be a good fit."
