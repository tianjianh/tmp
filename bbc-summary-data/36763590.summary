The proposals for the Shadycombe car park in Salcombe, Devon, are part of South Hams Council's plan for house building over the next 20 years.
Businesses in Salcombe and nearby Kingsbridge, where there are similar plans, say trade could suffer.
South Hams Council insists it will provide alternative parking elsewhere if spaces are taken away.

Property website Rightmove claims the average price of a home in Salcombe is about Â£550,000, more than twice the national average according to a Halifax survey.
Salcombe businesswoman Liz Hore said: "The car park is totally full with the cars of visitors coming to spend money. It is just beyond belief.
"Where will they park when it's a housing complex?"
Conservative councillor Judy Pearce said: "We are trying to get people's opinions on whether what we are proposing is a good idea.
"Nothing is set in stone at this stage. These are only proposals and that needs to be quite clear to people."
