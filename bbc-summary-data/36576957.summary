Mitch Claydon caused havoc in the afternoon session on day two with a hostile three-wicket spell as Glamorgan slumped to 137-6.
But Wagg (83) and Meschede (78) launched a counter-attack, adding 160 for the seventh wicket.
Claydon completed his five-wicket haul late in the innings, before Kent reached 10-0 at the close.
There were also five victims for Kent wicketkeeper Adam Rouse, a late call-up.
The partnership between Wagg and Meschede was a record for Glamorgan's seventh wicket against Kent, beating the previous mark of 107 between Arthur Francis and Eifion Jones in 1982.
Meanwhile, David Lloyd provided a Championship rarity as he got off the mark with a hooked six off Claydon with the first ball he faced.
Glamorgan all-rounder Graham Wagg told BBC Wales Sport:
"We were under pressure with six down but they went off their strategy of line and length, and it did give us a few scoring options- we had to put the bad ball away, and Meschy (Craig Meschede) played really well.
"Disappointed not to get three figures, it was quite a loose shot, but at the start of the day we would have bitten their hand off to be in this position.
"There's plenty in that wicket, plenty of seam movement, and I think if we bowl as partnerships, there's ten wickets to be taken."
