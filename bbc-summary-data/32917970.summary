Thirty-nine fans died when people were crushed against a wall that then collapsed at the ground in Brussels before the 1985 European Cup final between Liverpool and Juventus.
The disaster unfolded after a surge by Liverpool fans drove supporters of the Italian club towards the wall.
Memorial events have taken place at Liverpool's Anfield stadium as well as at the scene of the tragedy in Belgium.
Representatives from Liverpool, including club ambassador Ian Rush - who also played for Juventus - also paid their respects during a special Mass at Chiesa della Gran Madre di Dio church in Turin.
In Brussels the ceremony at the now-renamed King Baudouin Stadium included the laying of wreaths and families of those who died releasing balloons.
Phil Neal, who captained the Reds on the night of the disaster, laid a wreath at the Heysel Memorial in Anfield's Centenary Stand.
The stand will remain open for the rest of the day to allow people to remember those affected by the tragedy.
A ceremony at the site of the disaster in Brussels, now known as the King Baudouin Stadium, included the laying of wreaths. Relatives of those who died released balloons to remember their loved ones.
After a five-month trial which followed the disaster, 14 Liverpool fans were found guilty of manslaughter and jailed for three years.
An investigation in Belgium recommended that some of the blame be laid on the police and the football authorities.
What happened at Heysel also led to English clubs being barred from European competition for five years, with Liverpool serving an extra year.
