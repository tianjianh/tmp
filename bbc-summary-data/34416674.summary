Man with learning difficulties died on day trip to reservoir

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man with learning difficulties died on a day trip to a reservoir after going for a walk with a carer, an inquest has heard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Majid Akhtar, 28, from Nottingham, was on an activity day from Springwood Day Centre in Mapperley.
Nottingham Coroners' Court heard Mr Akhtar had gone for a walk around the perimeter path of Kings Mill Reservoir in Nottinghamshire.
He was found later by passers-by and attempts were made to resuscitate him.
Opening the inquest, assistant coroner Andrew McNamara said the family had been waiting an "awfully long time" to find out the circumstances of Mr Akhtar's death.
A jury of eight men and three women were told Mr Akhtar was taking part in water sports with other people at the centre when he died in September 2012.
He had joined in with the activities in the morning, but it was suggested he did not want to go back on the water in the afternoon as he had taken his buoyancy aid off.
Mr McNamara said: "He set off with a care worker... around the perimeter path of the reservoir.
"He travelled about three-quarters of the way around... and at some point, unfortunately, he fell out of view and he was then subsequently found by two people who were walking their dog at the reservoir."
Paramedics were called to the scene and attempts were made to revive him but Mr Akhtar was pronounced dead at King's Mill Hospital, Sutton in Ashfield.
Earlier on Thursday jurors were taken on a visit to the reservoir.
Majid Akhtar's father Aktar Hussain later told the inquest how his son needed basic care and help with things such as getting dressed and cooking.
However, speaking through a translator, he said: "He loved going out and he loved swimming. He could swim without an aid."
The inquest is expected to last two weeks.
