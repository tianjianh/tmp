Woodburn, 17, made his senior debut for the Merseysiders off the bench late in their win over Sunderland.
Klopp said there were many positives about Woodburn, but that the Wales Under-19 international needed time.
"There is really always a way, even when the first team is a really strong side," said Klopp.
Against Sunderland, Woodburn became the third youngest player ever to make a senior appearance for Liverpool, aged 17 years, one month and 11 days.
Klopp admitted it was a special moment for him and Woodburn.
"I thought it was a good moment, not only for Ben, but to show it for all the other boys in the Academy," said Klopp.
"There is a way [to the first-team], especially for you, whoever you are, as long as you are here and train hard and work hard, everything can be possible."
Cheshire-born Woodburn has pledged his future to Wales, and recently starred as they narrowly missed out in the U19 Euro 2017 qualifiers, but he still remains eligible to play for England.

He remains very highly-rated at Anfield and recently signed a new long-term professional contract at the club.
But Klopp admitted that when it came to a regular run in the first-team for Woodburn, he was yet to make up his mind.
"I'm not sure. Ben is a wonderful boy, but I am not sure," Klopp added.
"A lot of signs are very positive signs, not only with him. That's good to have.
"We can all speak a lot of times about opportunities for the young boys in our squad, and all that stuff, and sometimes we have to show it."
