[SN]TITLE[SN]
Bring back Craster kippers to East Coast mainline, says peer

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A plea for a Northumberland delicacy to return to a train company's menu has been made in the House of Lords.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Lord Mackenzie of Framwellgate said during question time that he remembered dining on Craster kippers while travelling on the East Coast Mainline.
The Former Durham Police chief superintendent asked the transport minister to use his influence to bring them back.
Lord Ahmad of Wimbledon said he would suggest it to the rail minister.
Lord Mackenzie said: "I remember regularly dining on Craster kippers from Northumbria.
"Could you use your undoubted influence to bring that menu back?"
To laughter, Lord Ahmad described contributions to the Lords as "an education in terms of history, and rail history in particular".
He said: "I'll certainly take that back and suggest to the rail minister that he puts it on his list to do."
The fishing village of Craster is famous for its kippers.
The North sea herrings, known locally as "silver darlings", are soaked in brine then cured over oak shavings for 16 hours.
When Lord Mackenzie was raised to the peerage in 1998, the East Coast rail franchise was held by GNER. It is now held by Virgin.
