The 27-year-old won all her bouts by ippon on her way to beating Croatia's Marijana Hasanbegovic in the final.
Israeli-born Schlesinger, who last won a Grand Slam title in 2012, gained 500 qualifying points for this summer's Olympics in Rio de Janiero.
On Friday, Britain's Nekoda Davis (-57kg) and Ashley McKenzie (-60kg) took silver and bronze respectively.
Speaking about Schelsinger, elite performance coach Kate Howey said: "After a disappointing Europeans she came back in style. This should put her in a seeding place for the Olympics."
The final day of the Baku Grand Slam on Monday will see Britons Gemma Gibbons (-78kg), Natalie Powell (-78kg) and Ben Fletcher (-100kg) going for gold.
