The 24-year-old joined Rangers aged 18 after starting out at Tamworth, and has also had spells at Cowdenbeath and Barnsley.
Hemmings scored 28 goals in 44 games in all competitions for the Scottish Premiership side.
"He is the proven goalscorer that we've talked about and he enjoyed a fantastic season," said boss Michael Appleton.
"There were a few clubs looking at him but we have talked to him, told him what we are about down here in Oxford and we are delighted to welcome him to the club."
Hemmings was on the four-man shortlist for PFA Scotland player of the year last season, along with club-mate Greg Stewart.
At the weekend, Dundee defender Darren O'Dea said the duo would be "virtually impossible" to replace in the short term.
