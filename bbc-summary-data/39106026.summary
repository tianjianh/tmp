Duvan Zapata put the hosts ahead when he burst past Leonardo Bonucci before firing between Gianluigi Buffon's legs.
Bonucci equalised when he headed home Paulo Dybala's free-kick - ensuring Juve's first league draw in more than a year - although Udinese almost won when Danilo's header hit the post.
Elsewhere, Inter Milan beat Cagliari 5-1 with Ivan Perisic scoring twice.
Andrea Belotti scored a hat-trick in the last 17 minutes as Torino came from behind to beat his former club Palermo 3-1.
The seven minutes and 15 seconds between his goals made it the fastest Serie A hat-trick since Andriy Shevchenko for AC Milan against Perugia in 2000.
Genoa scored twice in the last two minutes to beat Empoli 2-0. Atalanta drew 0-0 with Fiorentina, with Crotone v Sassuolo also goalless.
In the late game, Lazio beat Bologna 2-0 thanks to Ciro Immobile's double.
