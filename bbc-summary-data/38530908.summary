Matthew Liam Whelan, 29, from Mancot, appeared via a video link at Mold Crown Court charged with attempted murder after the alleged attack at a Costcutter store in Queensferry.
Shopkeeper Imtiaz Ul Haq, 58, suffered serious knife injuries to his throat in the incident.
Co-defendant Leslie Baines, 47, from Connah's Quay is accused of robbery.
It is alleged a till drawer containing an unknown amount of cash was taken in the incident on 8 December.
Judge Rhys Rowlands agreed that the defence should have the opportunity to view the CCTV footage from the shop before formal pleas were entered.
The hearing was adjourned and a trial will take place on 22 May, and is expected to last five days.
Both accused men remain in custody.
