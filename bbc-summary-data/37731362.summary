[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Michael Freshwater, 49, was found stabbed to death at a property in Westridge Road on 29 April.
Two men, aged 23 and 21, from London, and a 17-year-old boy from Kent, were arrested on suspicion of murder.
Hampshire Constabulary said, after submitting a file to the Crown Prosecution Service, it was told "no further action should be taken".
A spokeswoman said: "This is a complex case and although we are still appealing for information, we are not looking for anyone else."
A reward of Â£10,000 from the Crimestoppers charity, for information that leads to the successful conviction of anyone responsible for Mr Freshwater's death, remains on offer.
More than a dozen people have been arrested in connection with the investigation.
Hampshire Constabulary said it was believed there was a dispute at the property.
