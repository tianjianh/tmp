Mark Done, 51, died when Peter Tootle's Volvo lorry crashed into stationary cars on the M53 near Woodchurch, Wirral, on 30 September 2014.
Two other people were seriously injured, one being left with "life-changing" injuries, police said.
Tootle, of Blacon, Chester, was jailed for two-and-a-half years at Liverpool Crown Court.
The 61-year-old, who admitted causing death by dangerous driving, was also handed a 25-month sentence for causing serious injury while driving dangerously, to run concurrently.
He was also banned from driving for five years.
The crash, which damaged eight vehicles, happened close to the M53 turn-off at Bebington, where traffic had been at a standstill due to an earlier accident.
A further eight people received minor injuries.
PC Darran Doyle, of Merseyside Police, said the collision had had a "devastating impact" on several families.
He added: "All this could have been avoided if the driver had heeded the warning signals which were clear to be seen."
