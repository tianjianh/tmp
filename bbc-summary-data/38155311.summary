[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Exeter City right-back Pierce Sweeney has been ruled out until January after injuring his ankle in the 0-0 draw with Luton Town.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 22-year-old is the latest defender to get a long-term injury after Jordan Tillson and Troy Archibald-Henville.
Sweeney is awaiting the results of a scan to discover if he needs surgery.
He has played more games than any Exeter player this season after moving to the League Two club from Reading in the summer.
