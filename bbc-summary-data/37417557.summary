Taking the pulse: How healthy is Scotland?

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Scottish Health Survey attempts to measure key facts about the health and wellbeing of people living in Scotland. It indicates Scots have better teeth, drink less - and fewer smoke. But what else does it reveal about the nation's health?

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Levels of wellbeing were significantly lower for women aged 16-24 than for other age groups of men and women. Self-harm, including attempted suicide, was most commonly reported by this age group.
A total of 23% of young women reported self-harming.
Poor health was strongly associated with living in deprived areas.
Multiple health conditions were reported by 34% of people in these areas, compared with just 18% of those in the least deprived areas.
More Scots are keeping at least some of their natural teeth - 92% now, up from 88% in 2008.
Older men are more likely to have their own teeth than women of the same age.  In the age group 65-74, 85% of men but just 77% of women had some of their own teeth.
A key measure of binge drinking indicates it has declined from 24% of the adult population (in 2003) to 20%.
Overall consumption of alcohol has also declined. But 36% of men and 17% of women report drinking more than 14 units a week - the government's advised safe limit.
Adults who say they smoke make up 21% of the population, down from 28% in 2003.
The proportion of children exposed to second-hand smoke at home fell from 11% in 2014 to 6% in 2015.
Men are more likely to be physically active than women.
Overall, there has been little change in levels of activity, with 26% of adults meeting guidelines for both moderate of vigorous physical activity (MVPA) and muscle strengthening.
There has been a slight decline in the proportion of children taking part in sport, from 71% in 2008 to 68% now.
Among adults, 65% are overweight, including 29% who are obese.
The survey reported 15% of boys and 14% of girls as being at risk of obesity - figures identical to those recorded in 1998.
