World stock market investors endure volatile year in 2015

Investors in stock markets around the world endured a volatile year in 2015.

In some cases they lost money on their investments as individual markets ended the year lower than they started.
The 100 share index dropped by 5% during 2015, the Dow Jones average in New York fell back during the year, and so did the Hang Seng index in Hong Kong.
But despite wild volatility, the Shanghai Composite index in China ended up over the year.
Events in China had the most potent impact on world stock markets.
A combination of slower economic growth, bungled management of its country's exchange rate, a plunge in world commodity prices linked to reduced Chinese demand, and huge gyrations on the Chinese stock market - the handling of which was also bungled by the Chinese authorities -  all spilled over to other stock markets around the globe.
Ben Kumar at Seven Investment Management in London said: "China was nothing but a wild ride all year - the market was up 50% at one point and down 15% at some points."
"China has always been volatile but this year people outside the country paid attention."
Foreign ownership of shares in China is very restricted and most shares traded there are owned by domestic investors.
Even so, events in the country had a big impact on other stock markets and June, July and August were particularly uncomfortable.
"Events in Asia and the emerging markets conspired to undermine other markets," said Steve Clayton, head of equity research at the UK investment form Hargreaves Lansdown.
Mr Kumar added: "The US equity market took a big pause and suffered its worst year since 2008".
Probably the most fundamental economic trend of the year was the huge fall in the price of oil.
In May the price of a barrel of Brent Crude oil had crept back up to $67 a barrel from earlier low points in the year, but since then it has fallen steadily to end the year at just $37 a barrel.
Although this has brought some welcome relief to many consumers who buy products made from oil, the new low price threatens to undermine the economies of the world's oil producers, and is disrupting the businesses of the huge oil and gas companies that dominate the industry world-wide.
