Leah Washington, 18, was joined by Joe Pugh, 19 - who was also involved in the crash - for the annual Barnsley Hospital Charity Rainbow Dash.
Ms Washington's left leg was amputated following the Smiler crash at the Staffordshire park last June.
Mr Pugh shattered both his kneecaps when the ride crashed into an empty carriage.
