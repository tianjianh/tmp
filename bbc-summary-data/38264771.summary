Demitre Clarke-Oliver, 24, of Kennet Walk, Reading, admitted causing grievous bodily harm to PC Raymond Tse on 1 October in Oxford city centre.
He threw a single punch and ran away but was detained by another officer using pepper spray, Oxford Crown Court heard.
PC Tse had two plates and eight pins inserted in his jaw after it was fractured in two places.
Superintendent Joe Kidman said: "To attack a police officer is a cowardly and despicable act."
