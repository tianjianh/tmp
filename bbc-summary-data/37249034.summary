[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The case against a teacher accused of stopping Christmas and Diwali celebrations at a school has not been proven, a disciplinary panel has ruled.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Asif Kahn, who worked at Oldknow Academy in Birmingham, had faced allegations of misconduct.
A National College of Teaching and Leadership panel heard the allegations against him in November, although Mr Khan did not appear at the hearing.
The Professional Conduct Panel has said it did not find the case proven.
Oldknow Academy was one of several schools investigated amid claims of a Muslim hardliners' plot to control them; known as the Trojan Horse affair.

Mr Khan had been accused of agreeing "to the inclusion of an undue amount of religious influence in the education of pupils" at Oldknow, on or before 31 July 2014.
The accusations had included telling some male pupils to change for PE in a cupboard so they would not show their thighs, banning children singing during a production of The Wizard of Oz and turning his back on a woman as she offered to shake his hand.
He was also accused of sharing his personal beliefs with the children, for example telling the children they were not allowed pet dogs as they were Muslim.
A fellow teacher, former-acting head teacher Jahangir Akbar, was banned from teaching indefinitely in January, although he can apply to have his ban set aside in five years time.
