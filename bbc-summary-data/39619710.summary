The Carrickfergus rider had worked his way up to fifth place in the second race before coming off on lap 22 of 30.
Michael Laverty was eighth in race one and 11th in race two to occupy 10th in the overall standings after two rounds.
David Allingham was second in Monday's feature Supersport event to lie 40 points behind leader Tarran Mackenzie.
The Scot maintained his perfect start to the season by winning at Brands to make it four wins and 100 points from four outings.
Clogher rider Keith Farmer was sixth on Monday and is fourth in the championship on 57 points, with Andrew Irwin from Carrickfergus fifth on 50 after taking a seventh position.
Alastair Seeley is unable to score points on his Spirit Moto2 machine but underlined his good form by adding a third position to his fifth and second-place results on Sunday.
In Sunday's opening Supersport sprint race, Irwin was runner-up, with Farmer third, Seeley fifth and Allingham sixth.
Irwin was unable to start race two as his team were unable to repair his machine in time for the re-start after his crash had brought out a red flag.
Seeley was second, Farmer third and Allingham fourth, behind dominant McAMS Yamaha pilot Mackenzie.
For race two, poleman Irwin slipped off on the opening lap after being caught out by a rain shower, with Farmer also coming off as the red flags came out.
Bournemouth JG Speedfit Kawasaki rider Luke Mossey was a double winner in the Superbike class and now trails team-mate Leon Haslam by five points at the top of the championship.
Carl Phillips was 12th and 14th on his MD Racing BMW in the two Superstock 1000cc races, Robert Kennedy ninth in the Superstock 600cc class and Scott Swann 21st and 23rd in the British Motostar events.
