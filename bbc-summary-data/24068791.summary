Scottish League Two ins and outs summer 2013

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The most significant movements involving clubs from League Two this summer have been departures, with Queen's Park being the biggest losers.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Talented teenagers Andrew Robertson and Aidan Connolly headed for Dundee United, while Lawrence Shankland also moved up to the Premiershipship with Aberdeen from the decimated amateurs.
With Junior football providing stiff competition in terms of finances, not so many well-known professionals are filtering down to the senior game's lowest tier.
Notable exceptions include Kenny Arthur, the former Scotland B goalkeeper, and one-time Morton goal machine Peter Weatherson, who have both joined Annan Athletic, while Shane Sutherland, the former Inverness Caledonian Thistle striker, is now with Elgin City.
Annan had the biggest influx of new players, while Albion Rovers, East Stirlingshire, Montrose, Peterhead and Stirling Albion also had a high turnover of on-field talent.
