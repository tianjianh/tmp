[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Gareth Bale scored his first Champions League goal since 2014 as holders Real Madrid comfortably beat Legia Warsaw.

Moments after Vadis Odjidja-Ofoe had struck the post for the visitors, Bale cut inside and found the bottom corner.
A Marcelo shot saw Tomasz Jodlowiec deflect in for an own goal but Miroslav Radovic pulled one back from the spot.
Marco Asensio smartly side-footed in from 18 yards, and after the break substitutes Lucas Vazquez and Alvaro Morata completed the scoring.
Cristiano Ronaldo was on target as Zinedine Zidane's side won 6-1 at Real Betis on Saturday but he remains stuck on 98 goals in Europe despite having nine shots at the Bernabeu, finding the target twice.
Ahead of kick-off in Madrid, three Polish fans were arrested for incidents in the city. The reverse fixture on 2 November will be played behind closed doors after Legia were punished for crowd trouble in their 6-0 loss to Borussia Dortmund.
Zidane admitted he hoped to improve upon the number of chances his side gave the Polish champions and Danilo's needless foul on Radovic for the penalty perhaps summed up some of Real's slack defensive work.
But Los Blancos are now unbeaten in 24 competitive outings and move second in Group F, level on seven points with leaders Borussia Dortmund, who won 2-1 at Sporting Lisbon.
CSKA Moscow goalkeeper Igor Akinfeev has now gone 40 Champions League matches without a clean sheet.
Akinfeev, who has 92 caps for Russia, thumped the ground in frustration when Monaco's Bernardo Silva made it 1-1 with just three minutes remaining in their Group E match in Russia.
Lacina Traore, a Monaco player on loan at CSKA, had opened the scoring but the Russian side are now bottom of Group E and winless in seven Champions League matches.
Monaco lead the group on five points, one clear of Tottenham who drew 0-0 at Bayer Leverkusen.
Like Bale, Samir Nasri had not scored in the Champions League since 2014 but his calm near-post finish earned Sevilla a 1-0 win at Dinamo Zagreb.
The Frenchman is on loan from Manchester City and now has three goals this season, one more than he managed for his parent club in 2015-16.
Sevilla are on seven points, trailing Juventus on goal difference at the top of Group H after the Italian side secured a late 1-0 win in Lyon through Chelsea loanee Juan Cuadrado's superb strike.
There was also late drama in Group G where Andre Silva's injury-time penalty completed a comeback as Porto beat Club Brugge 2-1 to move third, five points behind leaders Leicester.
