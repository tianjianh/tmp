Matt Ogston, 36, from South Yardley, walked from London to Birmingham in eight days after the death of his partner, Dr Nazim Mahmood, 34.
An inquest heard Dr Mahmood killed himself after jumping from the balcony of his apartment in West Hampstead, London, on 30 July.
Mr Ogston has set up a charity to help gay people from faith backgrounds.
Mr Ogston's charity, the Naz and Matt Foundation, aims to support people with counselling and work with faith communities to raise awareness.
The walk - which Mr Ogston organised with friends - finished in Handsworth Cemetery in Birmingham, where Dr Mahmood is buried.
Mr Ogston said he had been contacted by several gay people of faith backgrounds since Dr Mahmood's death.
"They have had to leave their families, change their names, move to different parts of the UK all because of the way they were born," he said.
