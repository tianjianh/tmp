League One bottom club Coventry City are weighing up the signing of much-travelled former Nigeria international striker Yakubu.

The 34-year-old is training with Russell Slade's Sky Blues with a view to being pitched into their fight for League One survival.
"He's had his first training session," Slade told BBC Coventry & Warwickshire.
"He's not played for a while. That's the only concern. But he's got a great pedigree," added the City manager.
"He's a one in every two games man, goals-wise, so if that's the sort of thing he can do for us we've got to be interested."
In a decade in English football, Yakubu scored 114 times in 250 league starts, plus 43 substitute appearances, mostly in the top flight, at Portsmouth, Middlesbrough, Everton, Leicester City, Blackburn Rovers and Reading.
He was a target for National League side Boreham Wood earlier in the season after returning to England following a spell in the Turkish top flight with Kayserispor.
Coventry made four loan signings in the January window, including strikers Michael Folivi (Watford) and Charles Vernam (Derby County).
Derby also loaned them defender Farren Rawson, while midfielder Callum Reilly came from Burton Albion and another forward, Stuart Beavon, arrived on an 18-month deal.
Coventry are currently bottom of League One, five points behind Chesterfield - and eight points adrift of safety.
They have 17 games left to avoid the prospect of being relegated to the fourth tier of English football for the first time since 1959
They are not helped by ongoing feelings of discontent among City supporters towards the club's owners.
But those feelings will be put to one side on Tuesday when Slade's team take on Wycombe Wanderers in the semi-finals of the EFL Trophy.
Victory would book only their third-ever visit to Wembley - and their first since their two visits in 1987, when they famously beat Spurs in the FA Cup final in May, then lost 1-0 to Everton in the Charity Shield in August.
But City boss Slade is more intent on ending the club's 13-game winless run in the league which goes back to 1 November, six weeks before his appointment as manager.
"We have to do something about it now," he said. "Not in three or four weeks' time. By then it could be too late. We have to address it now to give ourselves a chance."
If Coventry make it to Wembley, they would meet the winners of the semi-final between Oxford United and whoever wins Tuesday's quarter-final between Luton Town and Yeovil Town.
