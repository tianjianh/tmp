Ukraine: Your chance to debate its future

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A year on, and Ukraine's post-revolution government is still struggling to bring stability to the country while pushing for wide-sweeping reforms and rebuilding a crippled economy.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Away from the bitter conflict in the East, the government faces a daunting array of other challenges.
Can it push through economic reforms and confront the notoriously powerful oligarchs? And how will it define its future relationship with the West and, crucially, with Russia?
We want you to join the BBC's "Global Questions" in Kiev on 1 July and put your question to our panel which includes Ukraine's Finance Minister Natalie Jaresko, journalist and commentator Nataliya Gumenyuk, Opposition Bloc MP Yuliya L'ovochkina and President of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, Sir Suma Chakrabarti.
Thank you
Moderated by BBC presenter Zeinab Badawi "BBC Global Questions Ukraine" will be broadcast across BBC World News TV and World Service Radio.
It will be recorded in Kiev on the evening of 1 July 2015 in English, with a second discussion held by the BBC's Ukrainian language service on the same day - all audience members are invited to stay for both.
Thank you for taking part and getting in touch with us about the issues that concern you. We will post a clip of the event here shortly.
