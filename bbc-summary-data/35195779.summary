[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Dundee Sheriff Court heard Kevin Enticknap modified shower gel containers and a washbag in order to conceal recording equipment.
He also made videos of women and children using his bathroom.
He was caught when police searched his home after a tip-off he had been downloading indecent images.
Enticknap, 42, from Forres, Moray, pleaded guilty on indictment to one charge of taking or making indecent photographs of children, one of sexual assault, and seven further offences under the Sexual Offences (Scotland) Act.
The court heard he had drilled holes in the walls of the bathroom and his bedroom and run cables between them to make the films.
An investigation found Enticknap had spycam software on his mobile phone that allowed it to be used as a "motion triggered video recorder" that switched on when people came in to his bathroom.
Fiscal depute Eilidh Robertson said: "A total of 249 indecent images and 75 indecent videos of children were found across his devices.
"Photos and videos of women using the toilet and shower were also recovered."
Sheriff Elizabeth Munro imposed a two-year extended sentence on Enticknap that will monitor him upon his release from jail, and placed him on the sex offenders register indefinitely.
