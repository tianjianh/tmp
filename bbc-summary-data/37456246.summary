Brian McKandie murder: Case to feature on Crimewatch

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The murder of a 67-year-old man at his home in Aberdeenshire is to feature on BBC One's Crimewatch.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Brian McKandie was found beaten to death with a "heavy weapon" in his home in Rothienorman on 12 March.
Police believe Mr McKandie may have known his killer.
The case will feature on Crimewatch on Monday night. Crimestoppers has already offered a reward of up to Â£10,000 for information that leads to conviction in the case.
It was revealed earlier this month that DNA evidence has been found at Mr McKandie's home but no arrests have been made.
His brother Bill will make an appeal on the programme.
He will say: " We just can't put our finger on the reason for it happening. There seemed to be no apparent reason. Somebody, somewhere, knows what happened."
Det Ch Insp Iain Smith said: "We continue to appeal for information from the public to assist with this extremely unusual and distressing case, and I can only hope that the programme will encourage people to come forward and assist us in determining the full circumstances of Brian's death."
He added: "Brian was a 67-year-old man who lived alone, who worked hard as a self-employed mechanic and was friendly to everyone he knew.
"Why anyone would want to hurt him remains a mystery, however somebody, somewhere, knows what happened to him and I would urge them to look into their conscience and come forward.
"A dedicated team is investigating this incident with the assistance of a number of specialist officers and departments, however we are relying on information from the public."
