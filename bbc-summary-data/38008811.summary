Ms McCann has been an MLA since 2007 and also served as a junior minister.
She will now take up a new role assisting Michelle O'Neill with major transformation of the health service.
In a statement, Ms McCann said she was looking forward to the challenges ahead.
"My party colleague and Health Minister Michelle O'Neill is currently involved in the biggest transformation of the health service in more than seven decades," she said.
"That is a huge task and she requested additional support form the party to deliver this important transformation. The party agreed and I was honoured that I was asked to take up the role as a party advisor to the minister."
