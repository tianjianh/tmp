Former West Ham striker Jonathan Calleri headed the hosts back into the game.
But Spain international Koke curled home a fantastic 20-yard effort, before adding an acrobatic volley and Thomas Partey lashed in a late fifth.
Atleti keeper Jan Oblak saved a late penalty from Jonathan Viera.
Elsewhere in Spain, Girona - who are now part-owned by Manchester City's parent group - picked up the first La Liga win in their history, with Pedro Alcala scoring the only goal against Malaga.
