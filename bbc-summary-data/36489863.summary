The 40-year-old, who has fronted three series of the programme since 2014, said she was "absolutely delighted to be back".
However, she will host the show on her own, as BBC co-presenter Marvin Humes will not return.
Last November ITV confirmed it had signed a three-year deal to broadcast The Voice, after outbidding the BBC.
Humes had co-hosted the singing competition with Willis since 2014 and said he would "miss working with Emma and the team".
"I've loved every minute of working on The Voice for the past three series," he told the BBC.
"It's one of the best shows on TV and I'll definitely be tuning in to see the new series. I wish the new team the best of luck and look forward to working more with ITV in the near future."
In a statement, ITV confirmed Humes departure from the show: "Marvin won't be appearing on next year's series, but remains very much a part of the ITV family, and we look forward to working with him on other projects in the near future."
ITV has yet to announce who the celebrity coaches will be on the new series, due to air in 2017.
Auditions are set to begin next week in Cardiff, with the eventual winner awarded a record contract with Polydor Records, home to music stars such as Take That and Ellie Goulding.
Former Liberty X singer Kevin Simm won the last edition of The Voice UK, which aired on BBC One earlier this year.
