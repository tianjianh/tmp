The American, 65, who is leaving LA Galaxy to take up the post, led his country to the 2002 World Cup quarter-finals in his first spell in charge.
Arena also boasts the best win rate of any US manager, with 71 victories from his 130 games between 1998 and 2006.
He has also won five MLS Cups with LA Galaxy and DC United.
Klinsmann, 52, steered the United States to the last 16 at the 2014 World Cup in Brazil, but they have lost their first two games in the qualifying campaign for 2018.
They sit bottom of the six-country qualifying group, below teams including Panama and Honduras, albeit only a fifth of the way through the process.
"Any time you get the opportunity to coach the national team, it's an honour," Arena said.
"I'm confident that we'll take the right steps forward to qualify for the 2018 World Cup in Russia."
Arena's first day in charge will be 1 December, and his first match will be a qualifier at home to Honduras on 24 March 2017.
