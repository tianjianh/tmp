The 21-year-old made eight appearances for Stanley on loan from Huddersfield earlier this season and was released by the Terriers last month.
Crooks, who has also played as a defender and a striker, made just one appearance for Huddersfield.
"Sometimes you can be a victim of your own versatility and Matt's keen not to do that," said manager John Coleman.
"I think he gives us strength, he can play in quite a lot of positions and I'm delighted with that signing for both this year and next year."
Stanley have also extended the loan spell of West Ham striker Sean Maguire until the end of the season, after his four goals in 22 appearances so far.
Both players available for Accrington's game against Burton on Tuesday evening.
