[SN]TITLE[SN]
AFC Wimbledon 1-2 Cambridge United

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Cambridge came from behind to beat AFC Wimbledon and preserve their unbeaten start to the League Two season.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Dons took the lead when Jake Reeves' drive found its way to Tom Elliott and the former U's striker fired home off the crossbar.
However, almost immediately after the restart Leon Legge headed home an equaliser from a Ryan Donaldson corner.
Two minutes later Barry Corr fired in a volley - this time from Harrison Dunk's corner - to seal the turnaround.
