RNLI lifeboat changes for Pwllheli, Barmouth and New Quay

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The RNLI has announced changes to the lifeboat service covering Cardigan Bay.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Pwllheli and Barmouth stations in Gwynedd are each getting the charity's "most agile and manoeuvrable" Shannon class all-weather lifeboat at a total cost of £4.4m.
New Quay station in Ceredigion will have its Mersey class all-weather lifeboat replaced with a much smaller inshore one, costing £214,000.
The RNLI said the decision was the result of a five-year coast review.
All three stations currently run Mersey class all-weather lifeboats, which are said to be "nearing the end of their operational life".
The charity said the new lifeboats will allow volunteer crews to "respond quicker and travel further to help those in trouble at sea".
Pwllheli and Barmouth will receive their new lifeboats once building work to modify their stations is complete, and the change at New Quay will happen in 2020.
