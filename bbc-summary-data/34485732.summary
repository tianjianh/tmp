Guernsey evacuees to unveil plaque in Derbyshire

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
World War Two evacuees who left Guernsey in 1940 are to unveil a plaque in Derbyshire marking the 70th anniversary of the island's liberation.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
About 650 schoolboys from Elizabeth College lived in the county during the occupation of the Channel Islands.
Rob Champion, 85, was one of them and will give a reading at the service at Tideswell Church later.
Mr Champion said it had been tough as he had little contact with his parents but his time in Derbyshire was special.
The 85-year-old was one of about 4,000 schoolchildren who left the island following the collapse of France.
"It was quite an upheaval," he said. "[But] when you're 10 years old you don't really understand the implications... it was an exciting time actually. I have very special memories.
"It was tough but we had a happy time [in Buxton]."
Children had little contact with their parents apart from a telegram of 25 words sent with the help of the Red Cross, every few months.
Mr Champion will give the address that was made by his former headmaster in the pupils' final assembly before they made the journey to England.
17,000
people fled the island out of a population of 42,000
4,000 school children evacuated
2,000 islanders deported to Nazi internment camps
34 civilians killed when St Peter Port Harbour was bombed
8 islanders known to have died resisting the Nazi occupation
Bruce Parker, a former BBC Antiques Roadshow presenter and teacher at Elizabeth College, will also be at the service.
He said: "The government decided they couldn't defend the island so plans were hurriedly made to get the school population off the island immediately.
"The boys were lucky enough to be taken in or around Buxton and there they stayed for five years."
"[The people of Guernsey] have always been grateful for what the people of Derbyshire did for them and this weekend is a chance to express that."
The stone plaque will be unveiled at Tideswell Church, where the college held its main services from 1940-45.
