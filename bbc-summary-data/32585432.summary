Former Wales rugby league captain Lee Briers has spoken of his "shock" and "devastation" at the death of former international team-mate Danny Jones.

Keighley Cougars player Jones, 29, died of a suspected cardiac arrest after collapsing in a League 1 game at London Skolars on Sunday.
Briers says he has been "inundated" by messages from other former Wales colleagues over Jones' death.
"We can't get our heads around it. It's crazy," Briers told BBC Radio Wales.
Jones made 12 Wales appearances, the last against the Cook Islands in the 2013 World Cup, at which ex-Warrington and Wales star Briers was assistant coach to Iestyn Harris.
Wales were winless at that tournament and Briers says Jones' presence helped maintain morale among the squad.
"It's just something you'd never think would happen in this day and age. Everybody's just in shock," he said.
"Danny was genuinely one of the best people you'll ever meet and I'm not just saying that because he's passed.
"He was the funniest bloke in camp. He kept all our spirits high and it needed to be at times in the World Cup.
"I feel so sorry for his family, for his young twins and for his wife. It's just devastating."
Keighley have announced they are retiring Jones' number six jersey in his memory.
Former Wales coach Clive Griffiths was also among those to pay tribute to Jones.
