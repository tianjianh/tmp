A member of the public raised the alarm when they spotted two women struggling near Belhaven Bay shortly after 17:00 on Saturday.
One of the kayakers was in trouble at rocks near the Winterfield Golf Course.
The inshore lifeboat (ILB) was launched to bring the women to safety. They were then checked over by ambulance staff at the harbour.
Dunbar coxswain Gary Fairbairn, from the RNLI, said: "We want people to enjoy the water but when things go wrong it's very important to be able to raise the alarm.
"In this case a member of the public spotted the danger and we were able to respond. However, we urge all kayakers to prepare for every eventuality and call for help if in trouble."
