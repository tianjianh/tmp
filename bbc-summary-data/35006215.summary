The 22-year-old will be the White Rose's youngest skipper since limited-overs games were introduced in 1963.
Lees led the side for the last few games of last season after Championship skipper Andrew Gale stood down.
"After considering a number of candidates, we feel Alex is the right fit for us as captain," coach Jason Gillespie told the county's website.
"He learnt a lot on the job last season and we think he can develop as a leader further. We are delighted to afford him this opportunity and believe that he will do a fantastic job for our club."
