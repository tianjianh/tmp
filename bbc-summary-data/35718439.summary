Paralympian David Smith has undergone nine hours of life-saving surgery to a tumour just 8mm (0.3in) from his spine.

The 37-year-old said the surgery went well, but said he had been left temporarily paralysed on one side and was unable to use his left arm and leg.
The athlete, from Aviemore, won gold in rowing at the London Paralympics in 2012 and hoped to compete in Rio this summer in cycling.
However, the need to have another operation ended his dream.
If the tumour was left, there was a risk it would crush his spinal cord and stop him breathing.
In a video recorded from his hospital bed, Smith said: "I feel very good. [I'm] still here. I'm going to push on with the rehab now and get going.
"I need to learn to walk again, learn to stand and anything. Thank you so much for all the messages. Thank you everyone for the energy, it worked."
