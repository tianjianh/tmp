Smith, 27, has agreed a three-and-a-half-year deal at Loftus Road after scoring nine goals in 53 appearances for the Whites.
Morrison, 23, helped the R's win promotion to the Premier League in 2014 while on loan from West Ham.
He made just four Serie A appearances as a substitute in 18 months in Rome.
Meanwhile, forward Pawel Wszolek has had his loan deal from Hellas Verona made permanent, triggering a contract that expires in the summer of 2019.
Poland international Wszolek, who has joined for an undisclosed fee, has three goals in 18 games for the R's, having signed on loan in the August transfer window last year.
"I think every team needs a big, strong centre-forward and Matt fits that bill for us," Rangers boss Ian Holloway told the club website.
"He's hungry, he's hard-working and he's got a massive personality.
He added: "Pawel has been wonderful for me since I've been back here so I'm absolutely delighted we've exercised the option."
