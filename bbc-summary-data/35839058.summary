The visitors led through Louis Dodds' header off the underside of the bar from six yards after JJ Hooper nodded on Carl Dickinson's left-wing cross.
But Town levelled on 73 minutes when Kaikai cut in from the right to fire in a brilliant 20-yard left-foot shot.
The hosts went down to 10 men in injury time when skipper Nat Knight-Percival was sent off for shoving Dodds.
But highly-rated on-loan Crystal Palace man Kaikai's 10th goal of the season was enough to stretch Shrewsbury's unbeaten League One run to nine games.
Micky Mellon's men are now nine points clear of trouble in 17th, seven places below Vale, who remain three points shy of a play-off place.
