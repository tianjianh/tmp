'Selfies' with Sir Winston Churchill, King Henry VIII and Laurel and Hardy are being offered to raise money for Wiltshire Air Ambulance.

The life-sized wax figures are due to be auctioned in Chippenham on Saturday.
But before the lots go under the hammer, people have been offered the chance to take a 'selfie' with the waxworks, for a £1 donation.
Auctioneer Richard Edmonds, said: "Churchill is the most realistic, it's uncanny, you imagine he's going to move."
The wax figures are part of a 1,100-lot sale of the entire contents of the Yesterday's World attraction in Great Yarmouth.
The Norfolk museum, dedicated to the Victorian era and early 20th Century, closed down in November, after it failed to sell as a going concern.
"They formed various exhibits around the museum and Winston Churchill stood proudly at the entrance to welcome people as they came through the door," said Mr Edmonds.
In total, 32 waxworks including a "quite frighteningly realistic" Chelsea Pensioner, "stylised characters" of Laurel and Hardy and Charlie Chaplin, are due to be auctioned off on Saturday.
"We've not sold 'Winston Churchill' before so we've got nothing to compare it to," added Mr Edmonds.
"But a waxwork of Paul Daniels made £6,500 a few years ago, so we're thinking an estimate of £5,000 to £7,000 could be appropriate for Winston."
The waxwork figures will be available for 'selfies' on Thursday and Friday, ahead of their sale on Saturday at the Chippenham Auction Rooms.
