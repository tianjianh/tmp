Arsenal midfielder Jack Wilshere is running again and could return to competitive action by the middle of March, says boss Arsene Wenger.

England international Wilshere has not played this season after fracturing his left fibula in August.
The 24-year-old was initially expected to be out for three months.
"Jack is starting to run," said Wenger. "Once you move outside, from the first day you count six weeks to be competitive and build up stamina."
Wilshere's career has been plagued with ankle problems since he first sustained a stress fracture during pre-season in 2011, which left him sidelined for 15 months.
He had two operations last season after injuring his left ankle against Manchester United in November 2014.
Meanwhile, Gunners striker Danny Welbeck has returned to full training after knee surgery which has also kept him out for the season.
