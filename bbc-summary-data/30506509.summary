The 54-year-old was arrested after "clashing" with a teenager at the store in Camden on Friday 17 October.
In a statement posted on his website following the incident, Mr Joyce claimed he had asked for the police to be called after he had "detained a youth".
He is due to appear at Highbury Corner Magistrates' Court on 30 December.
The Metropolitan Police said the former Labour MP, who is now an independent, had been charged with two counts of common assault and one count of criminal damage.
