The theme park at the empty Tropicana building is now being dismantled after the five week exhibition.
The previous tourist information centre at the Winter Gardens closed at the end of last month.
Mike Jackson, North Somerset Council's chief executive, said discussions were taking place with the town council about using the location.
"The future of tourist information is going to be quite heavily online based, but we are exploring whether the new possibilities created by the interest in Dismaland means we can perhaps provide something at the Tropicana," he said.
Mr Jackson said the Tropicana site could also now be used for further events and exhibitions by "local and regional" artists.
Dismaland attracted about 200,000 visitors during its five-week run, and brought about Â£20m to the local economy, according to tourism bosses.
Street artist Banksy's website stated that timber and fixtures from the dismantled exhibition will be sent to a migrant camp in Calais to build shelters.
