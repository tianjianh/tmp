He was named as Abu Daigham al-Baritani or Abu Daigham al-Britani - the suffix adopted by those who have travelled from the UK to fight in the country.
He is said to have been part of the Rayat al-Tawheed, a group of British combatants linked to the rebel Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIS).
A statement apparently issued on the Rayat al-Tawheed Instagram account said the man was killed "a few nights ago".
The Foreign Office said it was unable to confirm the death.
Shiraz Maher, senior fellow at the International Centre for the Study of Radicalisation at King's College London, tweeted that the man, who was reportedly from London, has "featured regularly in Rayat Tawheed vids".
Tens of thousands of people have been killed in the Syrian conflict and millions displaced.
An estimated 500 Europeans are now fighting in the country, according to the EU's anti-terror chief.
A Foreign Office spokeswoman said: "The UK has no representation in Syria, and we are not able to provide consular services.
"While we look into reports we receive of British nationals being killed or injured in Syria, these are often very hard to verify because we have no in-country presence."
