The two men could not be separated after completing the 31.8-mile (50 km) race in five hours, two minutes and 47 seconds on Sunday.
James Quirk completed the top three, finishing 10 minutes behind the leaders, with Karen Chiarello the leading lady, in fifth.
The course shadows the Parish Walk from Peel to Bride and on to Ramsey.
The event was renamed in 2016 with all proceeds going to the Firefighters Charity, which provides assistance to serving firefighters, retired firefighters and their families.
