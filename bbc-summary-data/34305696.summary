The Belfast Giants completed an overtime victory over the Edinburgh Capitals on Saturday night - 24 hours after the Challenge Cup contest began.

On Friday, officials blundered by ruling the game had ended in a 3-3 draw when it should actually have gone into a sudden-death additional 10 minutes.
It was decided the overtime would be played before the teams' league clash at the SSE Arena the following night.
Kris Beech scored the winner with just 10 seconds remaining.
In Saturday's Elite League match, the Giants ran out 5-2 winners with James Desmarais netting his first two goals for the team.
Desmarais got a tip-in goal in the first period when both sides were a man down due to penalties.
Six minutes into the second period he doubled his and the hosts' account, firing home with Edinburgh again a man down due to a penalty.
The Capitals pulled one back through Craig McCallum with a sharp finish but, in the last minute of the period, Mike Forney restored the two-goal lead for the home side when he squeezed the puck in from a tight angle past former Belfast netminder Carsen Chubak.
Two goals followed in the space of less than a minute in the final period as Everett Sheen scored for the visitors, after 46 minutes, only for Forney to get his second of the night within 40 seconds.
Jonathan Boxill made it 5-2 by meting Beech's fine centring pass with 10 minutes remaining.
It is now three wins out of three in the league for Belfast.
