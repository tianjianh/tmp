It happened on a service road outside A&E on Wednesday at about 08:10 GMT, South Wales Police said.
The Cardiff and Vale health board confirmed the dead man was one of its nurses.
Royal College of Nursing in Wales director Tina Donnelly paid tribute to the nurse after the "tragic accident".
She said: "Each day our organisation works to protect and support our nursing workforce.
"Tragic accidents such as this, which took place not too far from our headquarters, reminds us how precious life is.
"We would like to offer our sincere condolences to his loved ones during this time."
Colleagues of the man paid tribute to his work.
Ruth Walker, the Director of Nursing at UHW said: "We would like to extend our deepest sympathy to his family, friends and colleagues at this time."
"I have spoken with colleagues who worked closely with him who are shocked and devastated by this tragic death.
"They talked affectionately describing him as much loved by staff and patients alike, with such a kind and compassionate way with those he cared for."
"He was hard working and dedicated. He'll be greatly missed."
Cardiff and Vale University Health Board said staff from UHW had been working closely with South Wales Police to investigate the incident.
The man's family has been informed and the coroner has been notified.
