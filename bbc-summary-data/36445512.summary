The rare European Wolf cubs, which were born four weeks ago, were filmed playing by a keeper at the centre.
The cubs' arrival came as a surprise as their parents successfully bred only two months after their arrival at the zoo.
Staff thought the pair would not breed until next year at the earliest as part of the European breeding programme.
The mother, Aurora, was born at the Highland Wildlife Park in 2013 and the male, Loki, was born in 2012 in the Netherlands.
Kellie Ross, the keeper who looks after the wolves, said: "We have set up cameras with motion sensors and I was down changing the memory card.
"I was lucky enough to be there at the same time the cubs were out playing.
"I feel really privileged that the parents trusted us enough to let the siblings stay out of the den at this early stage while I was close by.
"It is lovely to see them playing like normal puppies. It really is something special."
Bradly Yule, the zoo's network manager, said staff were "very excited" to see the wolves with the cubs, which have yet to be named.
He said: "This is an important event in the role of our zoo and these pups will enhance the population.
"They will also serve as ambassadors to help reduce the pressure on wild environments where these wolves come from.
"The first-time parents have taken to parenthood extremely well and have adopted comfortable roles in upbringing their cubs.
"Our male, Loki, has been feeding and sharing food with female, Aurora, who has been carefully rearing her young"
