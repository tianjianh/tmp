[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Workers at the drinks giant Diageo have voted to take industrial action in a dispute over pensions.

Unions said the action could affect all of Diageo's 50 sites in Scotland, as well as other locations in Northern Ireland and Cheshire.
The dispute is over plans to move staff from a final salary pension scheme.
Diageo described the move as "clearly disappointing", adding that it was "premature" as talks between the company and unions were ongoing.
Both GMB Scotland and Unite members voted in favour of action, which could take place in the run-up to Christmas.
In Scotland, Diageo runs 29 distilleries and two bottling plants at Leven in Fife and Shieldhall, Glasgow.
Its brands include Johnnie Walker, Bells, Talisker and Dalwhinnie.
GMB Scotland, which has 1,200 members working with Diageo in Scotland, said members voted for strike action by a majority of 63% and action short of strikes by a majority of 69.7%.
Scotland organiser Louise Gilmour said: "Our members have sent a strong message to Diageo that the company needs to think again if it wants to avoid damaging strikes across Scotland.
"Diageo is happy to significantly increase executive pay in the wake of billions of pounds of profit but they won't protect the pensions of the workforce who have contributed massively towards the success of the business."
Unite, which has more than 700 members at Diageo sites around the UK, said its ballot showed 82% in favour of industrial action short of a strike, and 77% in favour of strike action.
It said sites in Scotland, Northern Ireland and Runcorn, Cheshire, could be affected by the dispute.
Unite regional officer Pat McIlvogue said: "We are proud of our members, who have sent a clear message to Diageo that they must keep their pension promises.
"No-one takes industrial action lightly - especially with Christmas coming up - but Diageo is behaving like Scrooge."
Diageo said it had been holding a consultative review with employees of its final salary pension scheme since February this year.
In a statement it said: "This process has involved detailed discussions on the future of the scheme and employee pension priorities as well as a proposal for change.
"More recently the company and union representatives concluded discussions at ACAS which resulted in an alternative proposal for change."
On the outcome of the ballots, Diageo said: "This is clearly disappointing and the company feels premature whilst we were in ongoing discussions.
"The company and employees are in a consultative process and have not yet moved into consultation on the alternative proposal.
"It is also far from the positive industrial relations of past decades that the company has had with its employees and which has helped build the reputation our supply business has today."
It added: "If and when strike action is taken the company will focus on ensuring that our business continues as usual as far as possible."
