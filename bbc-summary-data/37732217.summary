The 20-year-old has made five appearances for the Lions this season without scoring.
"It's a great chance for me to prove myself and show the manager (Neil Harris) I'm capable of making even more appearances for Millwall," he said.
Philpot is expected to receive clearance to make his debut for the Ravens against Wrexham on Saturday.
