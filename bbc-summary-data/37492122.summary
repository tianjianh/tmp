Phil Walsh: Son of Adelaide Crows coach not guilty of murder

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The son of Adelaide Crows coach Phil Walsh has been found not guilty of his murder on the grounds of mental incompetence.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Walsh, the popular coach of the Australian Football League team, was stabbed at least 20 times at his home in Adelaide in July 2015.
Cy Walsh has been detained in a psychiatric facility ever since.
But the South Australian Supreme Court ruled the 27-year-old could not be held criminally responsible for the killing.
Justice Anne Bampton said he had been "suffering from a psychotic episode as a result of schizophrenia, which at the time of the conduct was undiagnosed".
Walsh is expected to remain in detention in the secure facility and is subject to a lifetime mental health supervision order.
