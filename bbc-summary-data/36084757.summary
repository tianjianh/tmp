Norwich City and Sunderland have been charged by the Football Association for failing to control their players and staff during Saturday's Premier League match.

Players and staff from both sides clashed on the touchline early in the lunchtime kick-off at Carrow Road.
Both clubs have until 18:00 BST on 21 April to respond to the charge, the FA said in a statement.
Sunderland won the game 3-0 to boost their relegation survival hopes.
They remain 18th in the division but are now just a point behind the Canaries with a game in hand.
Sunderland manager Sam Allardyce was heavily involved in Saturday's incident, which came after Norwich winger Robbie Brady's challenge sent Sunderland defender DeAndre Yedlin head first into the advertising hoardings.
After the match, Allardyce said: "I got a bit carried away, but the Norwich players were encroaching my box - I was always going to protect my players and my mob."
