[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Gray opened the scoring in the 52nd minute with a fine solo goal before Slimani doubled the lead shortly after.
The Algerian scored his second four minutes later as he bundled home Gray's cross from close range.
Caolan Lavery's fortuitous late strike cut the deficit but Musa fired home in stoppage time.
The first half was largely uneventful as both sides made eight changes from the weekend's league matches.
Gray's goal was the first moment of quality in the match as he collected the ball 30-yards from goal on the left wing, drove in field and beat three defenders before slotting through Blades' goalkeeper Jake Eastwood's legs.
Slimani then scored a four-minute brace which looked to have settled the tie as the striker - signed for Â£29m in 2016 - showed excellent movement and composure.
But, Lavery pulled a goal back in the 83rd minute as his miscued cross beat Ben Hamer at the near post before the Blades pushed further with 19-year-old Foxes debutant Josh Knight making a fine block to deny Billy Sharp.
The Leicester defence continued to hold strong and in the 93rd minute Musa powered through the United defence and drove home to confirm the result.
