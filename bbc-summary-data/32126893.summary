[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A new housing development is to be built on the former Balmoral Show grounds at the King's Hall complex in south Belfast.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Balmoral Show has not been held at the site in 2012.
The former Maze prison site near Lisburn, County Antrim, now hosts the annual agricultural event.
The land at the King's Hall complex is owned by the Royal Ulster Agricultural Society (RUAS).
Nineteen houses are expected to be built on Harberton Park initially, with prices ranging from £500,000 to £700,000.
The development is a joint project between Hillmark Homes and Blue Horizon.
The chief executive of the RUAS, Colin McDonald, said: "The development is making use of the pedigree of land we have and we'll be digging on the site at the end of summer.
"You'll see the first houses coming on stream towards the end of the year or the beginning of next year."
