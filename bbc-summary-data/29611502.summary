Should a convicted rapist be allowed to return to his career as a professional footballer?

It's the question on many people's lips as ex-Sheffield United striker Ched Evans nears the end of his sentence.
More than 140,000 people have signed a petition asking his former club not to resign him. But several others are rumoured to be chasing his signature.
If he does return to the pitch, he won't be the first convicted criminal to do so.
The Queens Park Rangers midfielder has a violent past.
In 2007, when he played for Newcastle, he was was caught on CCTV punching a man.
He served two months of a six-month sentence at Strangeways prison in Manchester.
His boss at the time, Kevin Keegan, publically backed him.
Barton went back to Newcastle, had a spell at French club Marseille and is now back playing Premier League football with QPR.
In recent times he's appeared on Question Time, finished his UEFA 'A' coaching licence and started a philosophy degree.
The 34-year-old is no stranger to a courtroom.
The former Barnet, Gillingham, Nottingham Forest, Leeds United, Watford, Wigan Athletic, Hull City, Middlesbrough, Coventry City, Sheffield United and Birmingham City striker is currently serving an 18 month jail term for dangerous driving.
But he has a long list of previous offences, which include violence against women.
In 2009 King was sentenced to 18 months in jail for groping a woman and then breaking her nose.
Although he was sacked by his club Wigan, on release from prison he was snapped up by Coventry City, where he went on to win their Player of Year.
In 2004 the former West Bromwich Albion striker was sentenced to six years for causing death by dangerous driving.
After Hughes was sentenced, the Midlands club announced it had terminated his contract, which had two years left to run.
When he was released in 2007 Oldham Athletic picked him up.
In his first press conference with his new club he spoke of "having to live with myself, hating myself, every day".
The family of the man who died in the crash criticised Oldham for signing the striker.
Hughes went on to score 25 goals in 55 appearances for the club.
His career was littered with awards.
He won Premier League titles and FA Cups with Arsenal, even captaining the side to their famous Invincibles season in 2003/04.
But back in 1990 he served two months of a four-month sentence for drink-driving, after crashing his Ford Sierra into a wall after a lunchtime barbecue.
It didn't seem to have an adverse effect on his career though.
Adams was back playing for Arsenal reserves within 24 hours of his release and made the England squad just a month later.
The former Portsmouth manager, who suffered with alcoholism, then started his own Sporting Chance charity for sportsmen and women with addictive illnesses.
The Columbian goalkeeper, known as 'El Loco,' was a revolutionary during the 1990's.
He reinvented the role of shot stopper with his silky skills and eccentric style.
One of football's most colourful characters he played in the 1990 World Cup.
But it all started to go wrong for Higuita in 1993, when he was sent to jail for acting as a go-between in a kidnapping case involving an 11-year-old girl.
That meant he missed the 1994 World Cup.
But upon his release he returned to football and his most famous moment, the "scorpion kick", which he used to make a save against Jamie Rednapp in an England friendly at Wembley in 1995.
