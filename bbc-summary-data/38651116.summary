[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 18-year-old, who can play as a striker or winger, spent the first half of the campaign on loan with Town's League One rivals Oxford United.
Oxford were keen to extend the deal for the entire season, but the Wales Under-19 international has opted instead to move to Shropshire.
He has scored twice for Oxford this term, both in knockout competitions.
Roberts, who has made 14 substitute appearances in League One this season, made his Albion debut as a 17-year-old on the final day of last season as a 73rd-minute substitute in the 1-1 home draw with Liverpool.
