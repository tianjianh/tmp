More than 600 incidents were recorded in June and July in 2016.
The figures show a similar rise in the number of racially motivated hate crimes.
Portuguese community activist Iolanda Viegas told BBC Wales reporter Jordan Davies: "People said, 'out, out , out - you have to go back to your country.'"
First Minister Carwyn Jones is calling on people in Wales to abandon the "abuse" unleashed by the referendum campaign.
Gareth Cuerden, manager at the Wales Hate Crime Unit said figures had "increased a lot more than expected racially".
