[SN]TITLE[SN]
Campaigners end Fenton Town Hall occupation

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Campaigners who occupied a former town hall to try to stop it being sold have called off their month-long action.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Save Fenton Town Hall action group moved in on 9 November after the Ministry of Justice (MoJ) put it on the market for Â£500,000.
They argued a sale of the building could put at risk a World War One memorial inside.
The group had been due in court earlier after being served an MoJ eviction notice.
Fenton resident Jane Jones, whose great grandfather is one of 498 names listed on the memorial as one of those who died in World War One, said: "We've achieved what we wanted to by bringing the Ministry of Justice to the table, now we're saving the taxpayer money by not going to court."
The MoJ said a covenant would make sure the memorial would be preserved.
The protesters wanted the building, which was also once a magistrates' court, to be used for exhibitions, meetings and businesses.
