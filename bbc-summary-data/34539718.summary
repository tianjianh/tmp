Todd, 34, was handed the role on an interim basis after Richard Hill stepped down on 23 September.
The former Torquay and Exeter defender takes permanent charge of the National League side having led them to three wins in his four games as caretaker.
"Chris has got all the attributes we're looking for. He'll give us a young, fresh feel about the club," chairman Stewart Donald told BBC Radio Solent.
Eastleigh, who defeated league leaders Forest Green Rovers on Tuesday and are eighth in the table, face Cheltenham on Saturday.
The Spitfires are currently two points off the National League promotion play-off places.
"Chris interviewed extremely strongly," Donald added. "He demonstrated his strong character and he was enthusiastic.
"He's well connected and I think he can take us to the next level."
Eastleigh have also named former Bristol Rovers and Cheltenham Town first-team coach Shaun North as assistant to Todd.
Todd's first signing as manager has also been confirmed, with former West Ham midfielder Matthias Fanimo joining the club having previously signed for Bishop's Stortford on a free transfer in August.
