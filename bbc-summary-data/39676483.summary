Dagenham & Redbridge 1-1 Woking

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Woking left nothing to chance when it came to their National League survival by drawing with play-off hopefuls Dagenham.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Max Kretzschmar opened the scoring with a deflected free-kick after 12 minutes and Dagenham struggled to impose themselves in response before the break.
Kretzschmar forced a fine save out of Mark Cousins as the visitors continued to ask questions of Dagenham's much-changed side, but the hosts equalised in the 83rd minute as Scott Heard scored his first goal for the club.
Woking finish in 18th place, three points above the drop zone, while Dagenham finish fourth and will now prepare to face Forest Green in the play-off semi-finals next week.
