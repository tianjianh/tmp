One man in County Kerry parted ways with his false teeth during a wild night at the annual Puck Fair in the Republic of Ireland.
They were discovered by staff at Kingston's bar who posted a social media appeal that has since gone viral.
"The atmosphere was electric on Monday night," said bar manager Erwin Kingston.
"It was almost closing time and testament to the Puck Fair, there was a good party going on, with a few stragglers left."
As the crowd drifted outside, Mr Kingston said a staff member made an unusual discovery.
Forty winks
"They were cleaning the toilet and came out with a set of teeth and said 'look at this, you'll never believe what I found'".
Mr Kingston took a picture of the teeth and posted them on Facebook.
"Within five minutes, I was getting likes and comments."
The owner did not have to wait long to be reunited with his teeth.
"I spotted one guy in the bar earlier that night who went for 40 winks - I had a feeling they could be his."
Mr Kingston spotted him outside and handed him the teeth.
"He didn't say a whole pile."
"I'd say a good snore is what caused him to lose his teeth."
The annual Puck Fair in Killorglin, County Kerry, attracts about 100,000 visitors over three days.
A wild goat is captured three weeks before the event and "reigns over the town" as King Puck for three days and nights in a tradition dating back 400 years.
The festival begins with a horse fair on Monday and ends with fireworks and the taking down of the goat on Wednesday.
