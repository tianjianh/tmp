[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The patrolling officers were targeted in Brixton at about 19:30 GMT on Saturday by a man driving a Citroen C4.
The Met said the officers had been approaching the car on Plato Road having identified the occupants as "behaving suspiciously".
As police approached, the car was driven at them. No-one was injured.
The car also collided with several parked cars before the 22-year-old driver got out and tried to run off.
He was arrested by the officers, as were the two other occupants of the car.
The Met said knives, a small quantity of cannabis and Â£1,000 in cash was confiscated from the group.
