The deal was agreed last month, with international clearance now in place for the 23-year-old.
Mandiangu has been training with Accies for the past three weeks and goes into the squad for Saturday's Scottish Cup visit to Annan Athletic.
His contract will initially be until the end of the season
Mandiangu, most recently with Eindhoven in the Dutch second tier, began his career with Borussia Monchengladbach and had spells with Neustrelitz and Berliner Dynamo in Germany's regional leagues before moving to the Netherlands in August.
"Christopher definitely wants to get on the ball and commit people, so hopefully he can add something," manager Martin Canning told BBC Scotland in mid-December.
