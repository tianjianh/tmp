A man who sexually groomed 13 boys on Facebook has had his sentence more than doubled by appeal judges.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Christopher Hodder set up a fake online profile and pretended to be a girl to trick his victims into providing intimate images of themselves.
The 31-year-old, of Kirkby Stephen, admitted 19 offences and was jailed for four years at Carlisle Crown Court in March.
The Court of Appeal has increased the sentence to eight years, four months.
He will spend five years and four months in custody and the remaining three on an extension period.
Det Insp Jenny Beattie, of Cumbria Police, said: "Hodder is a predatory, dangerous offender, I am pleased that the original sentence was ruled as being too lenient and that the sentence has been increased.
"I would hope that this acts as a deterrent to those who offend and gives those who have been abused the confidence to come forward."
