[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A primary school in Swindon has closed because of a gastroenteritis outbreak.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
About 45 of the 297 pupils and four teachers at Holy Family Primary School have been struck down by the virus, which can cause diarrhoea and vomiting.
Head teacher Karen Bathe said the decision to close had "not been taken lightly" but they had to "contain the outbreak as much as possible".
The school is due to reopen on Monday following a "thorough deep clean of the premises".
"This morning, there were a greater-than-normal number of children poorly and, as the morning progressed, more and more children were being ill and having to be sent home," said Ms Bathe.
"Closing a school is a very important decision, however I feel, after advice from Environmental Health, that this warrants it."
Gastroenteritis is highly contagious and can be transmitted through contact with an infected person or contaminated food and drink.
Symptoms can include vomiting, fever and stomach ache.
