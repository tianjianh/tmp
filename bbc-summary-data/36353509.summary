British Swimming head coach Bill Furniss:
"Our aim was to be on the front foot and swim tactically good races. We paced our races well."
"You have to put the competition in context [with the recent Olympic trials]. You can't do everything and have eight weeks of disrupted training.
"This was a great opportunity to swim in front of a home crowd and we take whatever we get. I am a happy man."
