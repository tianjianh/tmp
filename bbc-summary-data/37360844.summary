Four trees planted in memory of the longest battle in World War One have been traced after a nationwide search.

Acorns and seeds gathered from the site of the Battle of Verdun were planted in commemoration of the fallen across England.
But the exact locations of some of the trees were unknown.
The Woodland Trust has now discovered trees in Berkshire, Cumbria and Yorkshire with the aim of planting woodlands from the oaks across the UK.

Oak and chestnut forests were devastated during the 302-day battle, which claimed at least 299,000 lives.
The Woodland Trust said the Mayor of Verdun sent boxes of acorns to Britain as "a poignant act of remembrance" of the battle between French and German forces.
The trust already knew of eight trees before they began a search in February, but as acorns were sold across the country there was no definitive record of where trees were planted.
Those now traced are one oak in Forbury Gardens, Reading, two horse chestnuts in Beaumont Park, Huddersfield, and an oak in the grounds of Corby Castle, Carlisle.
The organisation will cultivate acorns and seeds from the trees to create four First World War Centenary Woods in Surrey, Londonderry in Northern Ireland, Carmarthenshire in Wales and Dreghorn Woods near Edinburgh.
A plaque at Corby Castle reads: "The oak was brought from the battlefield of Verdun and planted by Philip J C Howard of Corby May 1919 to commemorate the signing of peace."
Anyone with information relating to the potential location of other trees planted from Verdun seeds are asked to contact the Woodland Trust.
