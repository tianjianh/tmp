The British number five, ranked 226 in the world, had never played in Grand Slam qualifying before.
But he did not drop a set over three matches, beating Alexander Bublik, Sekou Bangoura and then Soeda.
The 22-year-old joins compatriots Andy Murray, Kyle Edmund, Aljaz Bedene, Johanna Konta and Heather Watson in the main draw.
GB's Naomi Broady and Katie Boulter both lost their qualifiers.
American Nicole Gibbs beat Broady 6-4 4-6 6-2 while Boulter lost 6-7 (7-5) 6-2 6-2 to Turkey's Ipek Solyu.
Norrie made his Grand Slam debut as a wildcard at Wimbledon, losing in the first round to Jo-Wilfried Tsonga.
"I'm a lot more comfortable on the hard courts," he said. "I have earned [a place in the main draw] and I feel a lot more confident going into this week than I did into Wimbledon.
"I love the UK and being there. The weather gets me down a little bit but I feel really comfortable out here on the courts and I love the heat."
Norrie will play the world number 642 Dmitry Tursunov - a 34 year old Russian, who returned at Wimbledon after virtually a year out with injury.
The US Open gets under way at Flushing Meadows in New York on 28 August.
