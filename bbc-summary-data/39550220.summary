Accrington Stanley 1-0 Crawley Town

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Shay McCartan scored his 11th goal of the season to keep Accrington's League Two play-off hopes alive victory over Crawley.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The forward dinked home three minutes into the second half as 11th-placed Stanley extended their unbeaten run to 15 games to keep in touch with the top seven.
Crawley's 20-goal top-scorer James Collins had a third-minute chance when he pounced on a defensive error but he fired wide.
Stanley grew into the game with goalkeeper Glenn Morris denying Matty Pearson at the near post.
In-form McCartan then claimed the winner, riding the challenge of Morris and finding the net for his sixth goal in seven games following a pass from Sean McConville.
Accrington could have made the scoreline more convincing but a free header from Omar Beckles was easy for Morris.
Josh Payne almost equalised when his curling effort was repelled by Stanley keeper Marek Rodak 10 minutes from time, before Collins blasted over from the rebound.
