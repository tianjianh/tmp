Royal Navy holds 'first' memorial service for horses

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Royal Navy has held "the first of its kind" memorial service to reflect on horses lost and injured in conflict.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The service was held at the Royal Marines Riding Stables at Bickleigh Barracks in Devon.
Five horses wore poppy garlands for the ceremony, including a horse named Rocky with the rank of sergeant major.
The service honoured not just the eight million horses which died in World War I, but the many others used in battles since.
A horse named Anoushka represented horses used in the Battle of the Somme, cobs horses were represented by a horse named Bob, a horse named Zabor represented Russian horses and a horse named Tango represented the officers' horses.
Stables chairwoman Cathie Gillespie said: "The service is one of a kind and it is the first time that anything like this has been held in the Royal Navy.
"Eight million horses and countless mules and donkeys died in the First World War.
"They were used to transport ammunition and supplies to the front and many died, not only from the horrors of shellfire but also in terrible weather and appalling conditions.
"We thought it only fitting that in this month of remembrance we remember the animals too and what better place to hold a memorial service but at the Royal Navy Stables."
