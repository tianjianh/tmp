In a video appeal, the footballer urged anyone with information about the death of Adam Jones to contact police.
The Wednesbury teenager was hit by a blue Volkswagen Bora which was abandoned at the scene.
A 21-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of causing death by dangerous driving and bailed, police said.
"As a father, it's difficult to understand what the parents of Adam Jones are going through," said Mr Foster, who has eight England caps.
Adam was killed as he crossed the junction of Beacon View Road and Walsall Road in West Bromwich with his bike at about 19:30 on 26 March 2015.
He was a "huge football fan" and West Bromwich Albion had pledged their support to his family, police said.
Sergeant Paul Hughes, of West Midlands Police said: "We remain determined to bring some closure to Adam's family."
