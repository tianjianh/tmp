Russell Slade: I've done my best for Cardiff City, says manager

Russell Slade believes he has done his utmost to ensure Cardiff City reach the Championship play-offs, but insists his future does not depend on the outcome.

Cardiff have to win at play-off rivals Sheffield Wednesday on Saturday to have any chance of finishing in the top six.
Slade, whose contract expires at the end of the season, says he has done a decent job in difficult circumstances.
"I am an honest person. I can look in the mirror and know I have done my best," Slade said.
"That might not be good enough for some people."
Cardiff trail Wednesday by four points and realistically have to win both their remaining games to claim sixth place given their inferior goal difference.
Slade, appointed in October 2014, has had to cope with slashing the wage bill and a transfer embargo in his efforts to achieve the club's play-off target.
But the former Leyton Orient manager did not believe reaching the play-offs or not would have an effect on his long-term future.
"All I would say is any success going forward is only going to help the situation, for sure," Slade added.
"We will have clarity before long anyway on what is happening."
Slade said reaching the play-offs would be a "very decent achievement" for the players and the management team.
"Making cutbacks and at the same time attempting to be competitive on the pitch, which is what was required here, is not sometimes an easy thing to do," Slade said.
"But we have managed to do that to an extent, what that extent turns out to be is very much still alive.''
Cardiff have been hit by injuries, with forward Lex Immers, midfielder Joe Ralls and Brazilian defender Fabio all ruled out of the game at Hillsborough.
Slade will take a 20-man squad to Sheffield, including Icelandic midfielder Aaron Gunnarsson and Gabon international Bruno Ecuele Manga, who is recovering from malaria.
Striker Kenneth Zohore, who has scored twice in his last two outings, is also available.
