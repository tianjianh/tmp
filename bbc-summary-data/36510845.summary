[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Sylvia and Peter Stuart, aged 69 and 75, were reported missing on Friday 3 June. Mr Stuart's body was found near their home in Weybread, Suffolk, later that day.
Ali Qazimaj, 42, of Tilbury, is wanted over the murder and disappearance.
A group is due to set off from The Bell in Wortwell later.
Suffolk Police are aware of the search.
Wortwell is near Harleston in Norfolk and about five miles from Weybread. It is an area of fields, hamlets and the River Waveney, which is the county border.
On Friday, police searched fields near the couple's home in Mill Lane.
Police believe Mr Qazimaj boarded a ferry from Dover to Calais on 4 June, the day after Mr Stuart was found dead.
His car was found on a terraced street within sight of the ferry terminal.
Any connection he may have to the Stuarts is not known.
The couple's son-in-law Steve Paxman, 61 and from Leicester, was arrested on 5 June in connection with Mr Stuart's death, and released on police bail until 3 August.
