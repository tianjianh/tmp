[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) is investigating the death of a 15-year-old boy who was hit by a police car.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Harry-James Kirkham, from Kingstanding, Birmingham, was struck outside a police station in Erdington on 18 March.
He died in hospital the following day.
The male officer who was driving the car was on a routine patrol and was not responding to an emergency call, police said.
The IPCC said its investigation would examine the circumstances of the "tragic incident" and the actions and decisions of the officer involved.
The teenager was with his younger brother and a friend at the time of the crash.
They had just left the Potters House Christian Fellowship Church near the police station on Sutton New Road.
Police said CCTV in the area was being analysed.
Harry's family paid tribute to him, describing him as a "cheeky chappie" with a "huge heart".
In a statement they said he had died from severe brain damage.
They said they were "devastated" but had "comfort in knowing that he has donated his organs to continue to help others continue with life, something which we know he would have wanted".
