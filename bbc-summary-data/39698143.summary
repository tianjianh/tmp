[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A soldier who has denied breaking into his ex-girlfriend's flat and cutting her throat from ear to ear has offered to undergo a lie detector test.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Lance Corporal Trimaan "Harry" Dhillon is accused of murdering Alice Ruggles in her Gateshead flat last October.
Giving evidence at Newcastle Crown Court earlier, the Edinburgh-based signaller asked prosecutor Richard Wright, QC, to give him the test.
Mr Dhillon said Miss Ruggles fell on the knife during a row.
The 26-year-old claims he drove from his barracks near Edinburgh to retrieve clothes from the flat when Miss Ruggles, 24, attacked him with a carving knife.
He told the court he tried to get the knife off her and that she accidentally stabbed herself in the neck.
Mr Wright challenged the version of events and claimed Miss Ruggles died after the knife was drawn against her neck six times.
But the accused said: "If you are that confident, why not give me a lie detector then, sir?"
Mr Wright replied: "Lie detectors are the stuff of television programmes.
"Who knows? Maybe the defendant is so deluded he believes some of this himself."
Mr Wright told the hearing the defendant did not ring 999 to get help.
But Mr Dhillon claimed he tried to ring an ambulance, but panicked.
Mr Wright said Miss Ruggles suffered 24 injuries, while the defendant did not have any knife wounds.
Mr Wright said: "Alice wanted to live and she fought for her life that afternoon and you killed her."
Mr Dhillon replied: "No, I did not kill her."
The trial continues.
