One eye witness said she was woken by the raid.
"They were in balaclavas and they seemed quite aggressive," she said.
"They were trying to definitely get the ATM machine out, they were ramming it against the wall
"It frightened me so I ran straight back in, but I could see somebody was holding some sort of weapon in their hand."
The van was later discovered on fire at a nearby farm.
It is thought at least one other vehicle was used in the raid.
