Woolworths was selling the product ahead of Australia Day on January 26, but Tasmania, south of Victoria, was nowhere to be seen.
Woolworths said an Australian-based company supplied the inaccurate caps, but that they were expected to be taken off the shelves by late Wednesday.
But Tasmanians took to social media to voice displeasure over the error.
While some people said they were "disgusted" and threatened to take their business elsewhere, others saw the funny side of the situation.
"I was thrilled to see you forgot my favourite holiday destination from your Australia Day Caps. Keep on keeping Australia's best kept secret a secret," another Facebook user said.
It is not the first time the island state has been forgotten.
Performers created a map of Australia during the Opening Ceremony of the 1982 Commonwealth Games, but forgot to include Tasmania.
Pictures of native Australian animals obscured Tasmania on training swimsuits used at the 2014 Commonwealth Games.
At the time Tasmanian Premier Will Hodgman described the oversight as "unforgivable" and "un-Australian".
