Surrey and England opener Jason Roy hit a fine century to set up a 17-run win over Kent in a rain-affected One-Day Cup quarter-final match at the Oval.

Roy struck 112 off 116 balls, but his dismissal sparked a collapse which saw the hosts lose their last eight wickets for 81 as they were bowled out for 273.
Kent reached 22-2 before rain saw them set a revised 251 off 40 overs.
Matt Coles smashed a career-best 100 to take Kent close but was last man out as they were dismissed for 233.
Kent looked to be heading towards a big defeat at 169-9, before Coles hit nine sixes in his magnificent 73-ball innings as he put on 64 for the last wicket with Matt Hunn, who scored only one.
However, just as the visitors sensed pulling off a stunning victory, Coles nicked Tom Curran (3-22) behind.
Earlier Roy, who has been named in England's ODI and T20 squads to face Australia, was the mainstay of a Surrey innings which saw no other batsman pass fifty.
Once the 25-year-old was caught by Alex Blake off James Tredwell (3-47) in the 36th over, the rest of the batting line-up folded as the innings ended with one ball remaining.
Teenage paceman Sam Curran then continued his fine debut season removing Kent openers Daniel Bell-Drummond and Joe Denly, before a heavy rain shower led to a delay of more than an hour.
Once play resumed at 20:00 BST, older brother Tom Curran took two quick wickets and Zafar Ansari removed Sam Billings cheaply as Kent slumped to 49-5.
Darren Stevens showed some resistance with 37 off 35 balls before he edged James Burke behind to leave Kent eight down and still needing 111 to win off 77 balls.
Coles then provided the late fireworks, but couldn't quite get his side over the line as Surrey set up a semi-final clash with Nottinghamshire at the Oval on Monday, 7 September.
