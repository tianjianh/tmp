[SN]TITLE[SN]
Judge to quiz missing boy Mani Dad's Kettering uncle

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A salesman from Kettering is to appear before a High Court judge over what he knows about his missing nephew, who vanished six months ago.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Judge Mr Justice Peter Jackson is investigating the disappearance of seven-year-old Mani Dad.
Mani was living in Poland with his mother, Leyla Dad, when he vanished. He is thought to be in the UK with her estranged husband.
His uncle, Mohammed Chaudhry, is to appear before the judge on Thursday.
Ms Dad's estranged husband, Zayn Dean, 47, is also known as Dholtana Dad, lawyers say.
She has launched family court proceedings in a bid to find her son.
Another judge raised questions about Mr Chaudhry at an earlier court hearing.
Mr Justice Newton said at a hearing in June that his preliminary view was that Mr Chaudhry had not told him "everything that was going on".
He has told of his "grave anxiety" for Mani's welfare.
Lawyers for Ms Dad, 33, say Mr Dean has links to Kettering, Bedford, Birmingham and Manchester.
Ms Dad - who uses her middle name, Paulina - made a direct appeal to Mr Dean and wrote an open letter to Mani, saying: "I promise we will be together again soon, my baby."
Lawyers said she has begun legal proceedings under the terms of the 1980 Hague Convention on Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction.
