Swindon Town striker Nicky Ajose has defended boss Luke Williams' decision to substitute him in Saturday's defeat by Port Vale.

Williams was criticised by a section of the travelling fans when he replaced goalscorer Ajose after 75 minutes.
Vale, who were 2-1 up at the time, won the game 3-2 to move above the Robins.
"Luke getting pelters when I got took off surprised me a bit. I'm not (Cristiano) Ronaldo, I'm allowed to be subbed," he told BBC Wiltshire.
"A player can't come back from a fatigue-based injury and play 90 minutes the next week. It was meant to be 60 so I think Luke pushed me a bit playing me for 75."
Former Manchester United trainee Ajose has scored three goals in seven games since returning to the County Ground on loan from Charlton.
Despite back-to-back defeats leaving them four points adrift of safety, the 25-year-old is confident the Robins can avoid relegation to League Two.
"We probably need to win half our games to stay up. It's still in our hands, we've just got to put some wins on the board," he added.
"We've got enough quality to beat anyone. We just need to find the consistency."
