'Forever home' search for heart condition dog

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An abandoned dog with a potentially life-limiting heart condition is a "special dog" who deserves a forever home, say staff at a Conwy county animal sanctuary.

German Shepherd Orion arrived at the RSPCA's Bryn-y-Maen centre in Colwyn Bay in January.
But a check-up discovered a surprise heart murmur,  and she may need costly treatment in the future.
Staff say they were "devastated" by the news.
Orion was found abandoned in the Anglesey area in January along with another German Shepherd Sirius, who has since been re-homed.
The RSPCA said they are struggling to find a home for Orion because of her potentially costly vets bills.
Mel Kermode, the centre's deputy manager, said: "We can't tell whether her condition will or won't develop in the future.
"She could potentially live for years but it would be wrong if weren't honest with people about her condition.
"It takes a special person to take that on, but then she is a very special dog."
