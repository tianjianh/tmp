Euro 2017: Scotland players need to earn place in squad - Anna Signeul

Scotland head coach Anna Signeul has warned her players that they may have just two games left to earn their place in her Euro 2017 squad.

Signeul's side take on Romania in a friendly at the Falkirk Stadium on Friday evening, then travel to face Sweden on Tuesday.
Seven days later, Signeul will name her squad for the finals in the Netherlands.
"Players need to play for a starting place," Signeul told BBC Scotland.
"No-one has a place, and that's in the squad of 23 as well.
"After these two games and then maybe a weekend of club games we are going to select the squad."
Scotland open their European Championship campaign against England on 19 July in Utrecht, before games with Portugal (23 July) and Spain (27 July).
It is the first time the Scots have made it to a major finals, and the last one in charge for the Swedish-born coach, who will step down after the tournament to take up the same position with Finland.
She says the friendly games with Romania and Sweden will provide two very different challenges.
"Sweden will be the physical team, and we have to learn to play against these kind of teams," Signeul said.
"We know we have had problems in the past against Sweden standing up to their speed and physicality.
"This game against Romania we will play a team that has fast strikers, and are technically very good. You will be surprised at their tactical ability. They will come very prepared, they are almost like a club side."
One player missing from the squad is Arsenal midfielder Kim Little, who will miss the finals after she ruptured her anterior cruciate knee ligament.
The 26-year-old, who has 117 senior caps, sustained the injury in training with her club.
"It will be huge for us, but we can't do anything about it," said Signeul.
"I feel sad for Kim, I feel sad for the team. I also feel sad for the fans who don't get the opportunity to see such a fantastic player.
"But there will be opportunities for other players to step up and show they are of that calibre as well.
"The good thing with Kim is she's young, she's very fit, she's strong, she will come back. She's missing her first finals but it will just be the first, she will be in the next finals."
