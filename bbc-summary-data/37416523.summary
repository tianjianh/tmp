Joey Barton: Rangers midfielder investigated over betting claim

Rangers midfielder Joey Barton is being investigated over claims he gambled on Celtic's 7-0 defeat by Barcelona.

Scottish Football Association rules prohibit players, coaches, referees and officials from betting on football anywhere in the world.
The SFA says it cannot comment on the matter, which threatens 34-year-old Barton's future at the club.
On Monday, the former England and QPR player was suspended by Rangers after a training ground disagreement last week.
SFA rules state: "No club, official, team official or other member of team staff, player, match official or other person under the jurisdiction of the Scottish FA shall gamble in any way on a football match."
Hampden chiefs and the Gambling Commission are looking into the claims following Brendan Rodgers' side's 7-0 defeat in their Champions League Group C opener at the Nou Camp.
BBC Scotland senior football reporter Chris McLaughlin:
"Few would now argue against the feeling that Joey Barton's career at Rangers is over, but it appears to be ending in quite spectacular fashion.
"Less than 24 hours after he was suspended by the club after a training-ground bust-up, a front-page story suggests he broke football gambling rules by betting on a match. If the club is gathering evidence to prove the 34-year-old is in breach of contract, it certainly goes some way to helping their cause, if true.

"Just a day before the launch of his book, for the publishers, it's the perfect storm. Add into the mix a few lines from the man himself about his regrets at signing for Rangers and claims that Celtic tried to sign him first, and you have the Joey Barton circus in full swing."
