As well as learning more about Tim Peake's mission to the International Space Station, Destination Space aims to get people interested in all the different jobs involved in space exploration.
Some of the jobs include an engineer, who helps to build rockets and other space equipment, or a scientist who looks at the research sent back from space.

I might be a engineer.

I would definitely be an astronaut because astronauts have the opportunity to see the wonders of the solar system which I find very lucky.
