[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Two men, including a friend of one of the killers of Fusilier Lee Rigby, have pleaded guilty to charges of encouraging terrorism and disseminating terrorist material.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Ibrahim Hassan, 28, also known as Abu Nusaybah, was arrested after speaking to the BBC's Newsnight in May 2013.
Hassan was charged along with Shah Hussain, 31.
After pleading guilty in a hearing at the Old Bailey, the pair will be sentenced on 2 May.
Hassan, of Carr Road, Walthamstow, and Hussain, of Cannon Street Road, Whitechapel, were remanded in custody.
While appearing on Newsnight, Hassan claimed one of Fusilier Rigby's killers, Michael Adebolajo, had been offered a job by MI5.
The judge Nicholas Hilliard QC ordered reports be prepared on both defendants to assess their attitude to the offences and their risk of reoffending.
He warned them they faced jail for the offence of encouraging terrorism on or before 24 May last year - two days after the soldier was murdered.
The charge of disseminating a terrorist publication, which both admitted, related to an audio file of a speech called The Dust Will Never Settle by the deceased radical cleric Anwar al-Awlaki.
Hassan had previously admitted encouraging terrorism related to five video lectures entitled In Pursuit of Allah's Governance on the Earth and Hussain had pleaded guilty to promoting to a video lecture entitled Signs of a Good Death in Islam.
Hassan's lawyer Mozammel Hossain told the court his client had already been in custody for eight months and it had been "a time of reflection".
But prosecutor Riel Karmy-Jones told the court that a previous conviction was an aggravating factor in the case.
He said the pair made speeches at a mosque in Regent's Park in 2004, leading to Hassan being convicted of inciting terrorism and Hussain of fund-raising for terrorism abroad.
The prosecution agreed to allow remaining counts to lie on file.
Last month Michael Adebolajo, 29, was found guilty of murdering Fusilier Rigby outside Woolwich Barracks last May and is currently serving a whole-life sentence.
Michael Adebowale, 22, is serving a life sentence for the murder, with a minimum term of 45 years.
