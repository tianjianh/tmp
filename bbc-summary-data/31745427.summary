How your favourite authors are celebrating World Book Day

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Today is the one day in the year when it's not (that) weird to see Dennis the Menace food shopping with Where's Wally and the Gruffalo.

That's because it's World Book Day and kids (and adults) are dressing up as their favourite characters.
And, if you've been on Twitter, you'll realise that it's the UK's top trend #WorldBookDay.
So let's take a look at how your favourite authors are celebrating World Book Day on social media.
It's not surprising that the most followed children's author on Twitter is JK Rowling - especially when she posts messages of dogs in wizard costumes.
This World Book Day she's been sharing some of her favourite images of kids dressing up as Harry Potter characters - including a mini-Hagrid.
Not content with celebrating World Book Day from the comfort of his sofa, David Walliams is flying across the country as part of #WalliamsWhirlwind.
So far he's been to schools in Buckinghamshire and Bristol.
He's got a solid fan base who have been putting in some pretty good efforts when it comes to dressing up as characters he has devised.
Neil Gaiman has been retweeting some of them, including a Doctor Who based on the cover of the volume Gaiman wrote.

When she spoke to Newsbeat about World Book Day, she shared some pretty inspirational thoughts about why books matter.
She's also promoting Teen Fest, which takes place on Thursday and features lots of top authors talking to fans on social media.
You might be forgiven for thinking that, because of the name - World Book Day - it's celebrated across the globe.
But actually authors in the other parts of the world mark it in April.
We've included John Green here because he is, after all, massive on Twitter - and he really loves his fans.
Hmmmm, so the poet and broadcaster hasn't perhaps made the best effort with his own costume for World Book Day.
But we'll let him off, because what it lacks in creativity, it makes up for in authenticity.
For all you Oompa Loompas and Little Mermaids out there - it's absolutely fine if these are your costumes of choice.
