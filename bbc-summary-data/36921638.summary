Khizr Khan told a rapturous crowd that his son Humayun had sacrificed his life to save those of his fellow soldiers.
If it had been up to Mr Trump, he said, his son would not have been in America.
Mr Khan asked if Mr Trump had "even read the United States Constitution", and offered to lend him his copy.
Appearing on stage in Philadelphia with his wife, Mr Khan, 65, paid tribute to their son who was killed by a car bomb in 2004 at the age of 27.
"Tonight we are honoured to stand here as parents of Captain Humayun Khan and as patriotic American Muslims with undivided loyalty to the country,"
He said Mr Trump, by contrast, had "sacrificed nothing and no-one".
"Donald Trump consistently smears the character of Muslims," he continued.
Mr Khan, a Pakistani-born legal consultant, moved to the US with his family in 1980.
As delegates cheered, he said: "Donald Trump... have you even read the United States Constitution?"
Waving his copy of the document, he said he would gladly lend it to Mr Trump, and invited him to look for the word "liberty" and the 14th amendment on equal protection before the law.
The Democrats have focused on the themes of diversity and inclusiveness during the campaign.
They have consistently accused Mr Trump of sowing discord, notably with his plan to build a wall along the Mexican border and his threat to ban Muslims from entering the US.
In her final speech at the convention, Hillary Clinton - who will face Mr Trump in November's presidential election - said the Republican candidate "wants to divide us - from the rest of the world, and from each other".
Mr Trump tweeted that the speech had failed to address the threat posed by radical Islam, making the former secretary of state unfit to lead the country.
