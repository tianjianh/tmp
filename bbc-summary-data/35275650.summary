[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man who conned families out of thousands of pounds with empty promises of pilgrimages to Mecca has been jailed.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Mudassir Shaheen, 30, of Green Lane, Bolton, offered Hajj package trips at an average of Â£3,000.
He was convicted on 10 counts of fraud at Bolton Crown Court in December, with his bogus enterprise landing him a 30-month prison sentence.
Judge Graeme Smith said Shaheen had still not accepted responsibility.
The sham packages, which were advertised on a TV channel on Sky, saw Shaheen accrue Â£36,000 in total, but families were left without tickets or refund.
A victim's statement read in court said: "I cannot believe that a Muslim would cheat another Muslim.
"I had my bags packed and was preparing to leave any day.  This is not just about the money, it's a matter of my faith."
Soheil Khan, defending, said his client was effectively a single parent to his young sons as his wife was in Pakistan looking after their daughters and he seemed to have spent the money on groceries.
He added: "This is not a case of this man stealing the money and spending it on any sort of lavish lifestyle."
