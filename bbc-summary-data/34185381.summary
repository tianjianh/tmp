Controversial app-based taxi service Uber plans to expand into 100 Chinese cities over the next 12 months.

Uber chief executive Travis Kalanick announced the move at an event in Beijing held by one of Uber's Chinese investors, Baidu.
The service is already available in around 20 cities in the country.
The expansion puts it head-to-head with local rival Didi Kuadi which recently raised $3bn in funding.
China's internet-linked transport market is rapidly becoming the world's biggest and is proving lucrative for Uber.
Mr Kalanick said the firm had gone from a tiny 1% share of the lift-hailing market in China nine months ago to its current 30%-35% market share.
He did not specify what percentage of this was for private cars and what for taxis, where it faces tough competition from dominant player Didi Kuadi.
New regulations governing lift-hailing services in China are expected later this year.
Mr Kalanick said he welcomed the new rules but in other parts of the world, regulation is proving a thorn in its side.
Last week, a judge in California paved the way for Uber drivers to sue the company over their status. Some drivers claim they are employees rather than contractors and, as such, should be allowed to claim expenses and receive tips.
