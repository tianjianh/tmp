She said that she thought "farmers, certainly in my very early discussions with them, are perhaps not the best people to run a business".
"They haven't that kind of business perspective also, and they want to work with us in relation to that," she said.
"This is just some of the farmers I've spoken to early in the portfolio. I'm not saying all farmers at all."
