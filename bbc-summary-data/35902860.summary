Alan Stubbs' side took the lead when Jason Cummings struck midway through the first half.
Rocco Quinn fired in for the Buddies amid claims of offside from the visitors but the goal stood, leaving the sides level at the break.
Lawrence Shankland's shot turned the match in St Mirren's favour only for Farid El Alagui to level for Hibs.
The Easter Road side are now six points behind second-placed Falkirk and 20 off leaders Rangers.
However, Hibs have three games in hand over the Bairns and have played two games fewer than Rangers, who can clinch the title and promotion with one more win.
Stubbs' men started brightly in Paisley and Cummings latched on to John McGinn's threaded pass to palce an effort underneath Jamie Langfield.
Quinn found space in the penalty area and steered his effort home from close range, to the dismay of the Hibs defenders hoping for the flag to be raised.
Shankland drilled his effort low into the bottom corner to put the Buddies ahead for the first time and went close again soon after when he blasted over from the edge of the area.
Anthony Stokes tested Langfield before setting up El Alagui for the equaliser in the penultimate minute.
