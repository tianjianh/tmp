Christian Wolmar has been named as the Labour Party's candidate in the Richmond Park by-election.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The poll was triggered when sitting Conservative MP Zac Goldsmith resigned after the government backed building a third runway at Heathrow Airport.
Both the Tories and UKIP are not fielding candidates, while Sarah Olney is standing for the Lib Dems.
Mr Wolmar said the vote "gives us an opportunity to expose the disastrous policies of this government".
Mr Goldsmith, who is standing as an Independent candidate in the poll, won the south-west London seat from the Lib Dems in 2010 and held a 23,015 majority at the 2015 general election.
Mr Wolmar, a writer and broadcaster who specialises in transport, said it was a "great honour to stand for Labour".
He accused Mr Goldsmith and the Lib Dems of supporting "every terrible decision taken by the last coalition government."
"The only way to send a message to this government that we do not accept what they are doing to our country is to vote Labour," he said.
The vote will take place on 1 December.
