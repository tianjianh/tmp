Trump petition: Areas most opposed to US President's visit

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
More than one in 20 voters in some parts of the UK signed the petition against a state visit for US President Donald Trump.

The petition on the Parliament website passed one million signatures earlier and will now be debated by MPs.
It came amid mounting protest to the President's clampdown on immigration to the United States.
Constituencies with the most signatures were in London, apart from Bristol West and Brighton Pavilion.
As of 10:00 GMT the single largest number of signatures came from voters in the Bristol West constituency.
At that point there were more than 6,600 signatures, equivalent to 5% of people in the constituency. But it has since climbed to above 7,700.
Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn's Islington North constituency and shadow home secretary Diane Abbott's Hackney North and Stoke Newington were also in the top 10.
Mr Corbyn has called for Mr Trump's state visit to be postponed.
However, Downing Street insisted the visit would go ahead and said the "special relationship" between the UK and the US allows for "frank conversations at all times".
Mr Trump is expected to visit the UK and be hosted by the Queen later this year after being invited by Prime Minister Theresa May.
Constituencies in Northern Ireland and Na h-Eileanan an Iar in the Outer Hebrides were among those with the lowest number of signatories.
In England, Walsall North in the West Midlands accounted for just 430 signatures as of 10:00.

The petition had five times as many signatures as any other open on the Parliament website at the point it exceeded a million names.
However, it still has a long way to go before it passes a petition calling for a second EU referendum.

After signatures from the UK, the next highest number of names came from the United States, more than 5,000 of the total. All but about 30,000 signatures were from the UK.
BBC News took a snapshot of the petition at about 10:00 GMT, just as it reached one million signatures.
Since then the number of people signing it has continued to grow and the petition will stay open until 29 May.
A breakdown of signatures by constituency is published via an interactive map on the Parliament website.
