It is thought John Knott, 71, and his 70-year-old wife Elizabeth - who was known as Anne - died over the weekend.
Police were called to the house in Bosbury, near Ledbury, on Monday after relatives became worried.
The priest at the village church, the Rev Nicky Seabright, said Mrs Knott had a progressive form of dementia.
A post-mortem examination has confirmed each died from a single gunshot wound.
A shotgun registered to Mr Knott was recovered from the scene, West Mercia Police said.
The last confirmed sighting of the couple was at about 12:00 BST on Saturday.
Det Insp Richard Rees said: "We would like to speak to anyone who saw Anne and John Knott prior to Monday 11 August.
"At this stage of our investigation there is no evidence of any third party involvement and we can confirm we are not looking for anyone else in connection with the shootings."
Paying tribute to the couple, Ms Seabright said: "The community in Bosbury is deeply shocked by the death of this couple as they were well known locally, not least as plant growers and supporters of many events in the village."
