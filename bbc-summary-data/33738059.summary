A new deal to try to avert the Tube strike has been offered to four unions.

London Underground (LU) approached the Rail, Maritime and Transport (RMT) union, Transport Salaried Staffs Association (TSSA), Unite and Aslef.
Unite has turned the deal down which aims to improve the "work-life balance".
The details are not yet known but BBC London's transport correspondent Tom Edwards said the other unions would decide early next week.
The walkout was set to start at 21:30 BST on 5 August and follows a strike that closed the entire network at the beginning of July.
Staff are striking over pay and the new night-time services as LU and the unions have so far failed to agree on a deal.
Manuel Cortes, of the TSSA, said: "We shall be consulting our reps over the weekend and give our response first thing on Monday morning.
"As of now, however, the strike still remains on."
Steve Griffiths, London Underground's chief operating officer, said "detailed discussions" had been held about the original pay and Night Tube offer which the unions had turned down.
The offer had included a 2% rise this year and Â£2,000 for drivers on the weekend Night Tube service.
He said: "While we have explained that we could not increase its value, we have worked with the unions to re-shape it in response to their concerns over work-life balance.
"We have now provided a revised offer, which we believe addresses all of their concerns, rewards our hard-working staff and remains sustainable and affordable."
Talks at conciliatory service Acas will resume on Monday.
