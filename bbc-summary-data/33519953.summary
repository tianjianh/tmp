Robert Noble's March Street Mills in Peebles will close by the end of the year, after its parent company failed to find a buyer.
Moorbrook Textiles managing director Ian Laird said they received "no credible offers" for the business as a going concern.
"We will cease manufacturing at the site by the end of this year with the loss of all jobs," he added.
"We are disappointed that we have not managed to secure a better outcome."
Robert Noble can trace its history back almost 350 years. It was established under the David Ballantyne name in Galashiels in 1666.
In May Moorbrook Textiles, which is based in Ayr, announced a 30 day consultation on possible plans to close the mill.
It claimed the "seasonal and volatile nature of the business", as well as changes in global demand were to blame for the decision.
Tweedale West councillor Keith Cockburn said the closure of the plant will be a "big blow" for Peebles.
"I am saddened and disappointed that this historic and well-kent local employer will cease manufacturing in Peebles," he said.
"This will come as a big blow to the work force and their families as well as the overall economy of the town.
"We are all aware that it will be difficult to find full employment locally for such a large number of skilled workers."
