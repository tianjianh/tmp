The Daily Mail and General Trust (DMGT) said its full-year results would come in at the lower end of market expectations.
The company blamed a "marked deterioration in the UK print advertising market".
Shares in DMGT fell more than 8% in morning trading on Thursday.
DMG Media, which includes the Daily Mail and Mail on Sunday, saw revenues fall 3% in the third quarter.
This follows falls in revenue of 6% and 7% in the first two quarters respectively.
The group said MailOnline digital advertising revenue growth of £1m in the third quarter - an 8% rise - had partly offset a £7m decline in Daily Mail and Mail on Sunday revenues.
"Given the weaker than anticipated UK print advertising market for DMG media and the more challenging market conditions for B2B [business to business publishing], the outlook for the group's full year results is now towards the lower end of market expectations," it said in a statement.
City analysts expects DMGT to report revenues of between £1.82bn and £1.93bn and pretax profit of between £275m and £292m.
DMGT join rivals Trinity Mirror and Johnston Press in warning of weaker ad markets.
