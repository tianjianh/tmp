Columba McVeigh,  19, from Donaghmore, County Tyrone, was abducted, murdered and secretly buried by the IRA in 1975.
In April, a search for his body resumed in Bragan, County Monaghan.
His brother, Oliver, said: "We need specific information and the proper information is not coming forward and there's somebody out there has it."
He added: "If I was involved in the abduction, murder and disappearance of a teenager it would be embedded in my mind where he was buried. And I would have nightmares about it."
The first search for Columba McVeigh began 14 years ago. There have been a number of searches at Bragan near Emyvale in County Monaghan.
The previous operation by the Independent Commission For The Location Of Victims Remains was halted last autumn due to extreme weather conditions.
Oliver said:  "If I thought there was a pot of gold at the end of the rainbow I could wait for a long, long time but sometimes I have my doubts.
"The people who are giving information need to get more proactive. It's just going on and on and on and on.
"It wears people down. I get quite depressed when I come up here."
John Hill from the Independent Commission For The Location Of Victims Remains said he was "firmly of the belief" that the teenager is buried at the current search site.
"I believe that the people who have provided the information that bring us here are doing so truthfully. Are they accurate enough? That's a different matter. But I don't think it's out of design, I think they are trying."
Columba's mother, Vera McVeigh, campaigned tirelessly for the return of his body. She died in 2007, aged 82.
The Disappeared are those who were abducted, murdered and secretly buried by republicans during the Troubles.
In 1999, the British and Irish governments established the commission in an effort to gain confidential information about the location of their bodies.
