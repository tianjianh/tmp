The 45-year-old was arrested on 22 June on suspicion of assault with a deadly weapon at the University of California.
He was held in jail before being released on $160,000 (Â£102,500) bail.
The district attorney has referred the case to the Los Angeles City attorney's office to decide if Combs will face lesser charges.
"We are thankful that the district attorney rejected felony charges in this matter," said Combs's lawyer, Mark Geragos.
"This case never should have been part of the criminal justice system to begin with."
At the time of the incident, officials did not identify the victim of the alleged assault or say what led to the incident.
However, media reports said Combs was involved in an altercation with the university's football coach at the campus's athletic facility.
Combs claimed he was defending himself and his son, Justin Combs, who is on the college football team and had been working out at the time.
Head football coach Jim Mora called the encounter "an unfortunate incident for all parties involved" following Combs's arrest.
University officials have said little about the confrontation, except that no one was seriously hurt.
A spokesman said the school had no comment on the district attorney's decision.
Justin Combs, 21, has played just a handful of games for the UCLA football team since joining three years ago.
