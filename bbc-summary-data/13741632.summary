William Wilberforce statue in £10,000 restoration

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A statue of anti-slavery campaigner William Wilberforce is to be restored after almost £10,000 was donated by the public in his home city of Hull.

The statue stands outside the Wilberforce House Museum in Hull, where money for the project was collected.
Hull city councillor Terry Geraghty said: "William Wilberforce is one of Hull's most famous sons.
"The fact the work has been paid for by public donations shows how highly regarded he is in his home city."
The restoration work, which is due to be completed by the end of June, is being carried out by professional conservators.
Robin Diaper, the council's curator of maritime and social history, said: "We are very grateful to the public who donated towards this important conservation work.
"As a result, this iconic statue will be enjoyed by many people for years to come."
The statue will receive specialist cleaning, including a coating that will help to protect it for several years, rather than using a sand-blasting technique.
This will prevent damage to the surface of the stone statue that would have made it vulnerable to future mould growth.
