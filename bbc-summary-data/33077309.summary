FAI boss outlines Fifa payment in letter to Irish TDs

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The FAI's chief executive has written to TDs (MPs) on an Irish parliamentary committee to disclose details of a 5m euros payment from Fifa.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Last week, it was revealed that Fifa paid the FAI 5m euros (Â£3.6m) after France controversially beat Ireland in a World Cup play-off.
FAI boss John Delaney said a deal was made to drop a claim against Fifa.
TDs are due to decide on Wednesday whether to call Mr Delaney to answer questions before the committee.
Mr Delaney sent his letter to members of the transport and communications committee.
The FAI believed it had a case against Fifa after French striker Thierry Henry's handball in the build-up to a decisive goal in the 2009 match in Paris which caused Ireland to miss the 2010 World Cup in South Africa.
The payment from Fifa to the IFA was agreed in 2010.
Fifa said it entered into an agreement with the IFA to "put and end to any claims" against it.
Fifa is facing criminal investigations after allegations of "systemic and deep-rooted" corruption within the organisation, and its president Sepp Blatter is stepping down.
