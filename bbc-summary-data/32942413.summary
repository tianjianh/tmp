E. coli 055 in Dorset: Two further cases confirmed

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Two new cases of an E. coli infection in Dorset have been confirmed.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Public Health England (PHE) said they were from the same family as two children being treated in hospital for serious kidney problems following E. coli 055.
PHE has informed schools and workplaces linked to the household. Results on another possible case are awaited.
A cluster of cases of the bacterial illness in Dorset was investigated last year but no common source was found.
The two children are currently in hospital with haemolytic uraemic syndrome (HUS) - a complication of E coli infection.
Verocytotoxin-producing Escherichia coli (VTEC) 055 has been confirmed in one of the children in hospital, with test results still awaited on the second child.
PHE has also said it is reviewing the places the family had visited and the food they had eaten in the last two weeks.
GPs and hospitals have also been alerted about the infections.
Parents in the county are being urged to make sure their children wash their hands thoroughly, especially after playing outside or with pets, and to cook meat well.
Ten people in the Blandford area of Dorset were diagnosed with E. coli 055 between July and November 2014.
A further two cases were identified in Portland, four in Bournemouth and Poole as well as three cases outside the county which had links to people from Dorset.
Nursery children were among those infected with the bacterial illness, which can lead to kidney problems in some cases.
Earlier this week PHE said the strain seemed to be "particular to Dorset" and it would most likely remain in the general environment.
