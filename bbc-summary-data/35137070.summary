[SN]TITLE[SN]
Income tax devolution date demand by Plaid Cymru

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The UK government should make it clear when income tax powers will be devolved, Plaid Cymru has said.

In November Chancellor George Osborne said the need for a referendum on the issue had been scrapped, prompting the Welsh Tories to pledge tax cuts.
Plaid said announcing the tax cut policy without saying when the powers would be devolved was "clown-like".
The Wales Office said it was discussing the timetable for devolving income tax powers with the Welsh government.
In response, a Welsh Conservatives spokesman called Plaid Cymru's comments "simply bizarre".
He said: "Not only has the Conservative UK Government delivered a funding floor for Wales, it has brought forward two historic bills to transfer responsibility to the Welsh Government and the National Assembly for Wales."
Welsh ministers will take over responsibility for stamp duty and landfill tax in April 2018, but no date has been set for the handing over of some degree of responsibility over income tax.
Carmarthen East and Dinefwr MP Jonathan Edwards said: "Due to Tory dithering and inaction, it could be several more years before Wales actually gets the income tax powers that were agreed to by all political parties back in 2012."
The Welsh Conservatives have already said they would cut the higher rate of income tax in Wales from 40p to 35p, and cut the basic rate from 20p to 19p.
The Liberal Democrats have said they too would cut the basic rate by a penny.
Labour First Minister Carwyn Jones has said it was not yet clear when income tax powers would be devolved, but he wanted the UK Treasury to agree to fair funding for Wales before it happened.
