Jay Liptrot, 43, from Prestatyn, Denbighshire, was on trial for manslaughter but the case was dropped after he admitted a lesser charge.
Lee-Anna Shiers, 20, Liam Timbrell, 23, their son Charlie, Ms Shiers' nephew Bailey, four, and niece Skye, two, died in his flat in Prestatyn in 2012.
He was sentenced at Caernarfon Crown Court on Friday.
Melanie Smith was jailed in 2013 for their murder after starting the fire in a row over Ms Shiers' pushchair, which was left in a shared hallway.
Landlord Liptrot denied manslaughter but admitted one count of failing to take general fire precautions, exposing people to risk, which the prosecution accepted after consulting the family of the victims.
The court heard he was one of the firefighters who "was at the forefront of brave efforts" to rescue the five from the flat after the blaze was started.
In a statement read in court, Steve Allen, who lost two children, his sister and nephew in the fire, said: "We hope Jay learns his lesson, not just for him but all landlords."
Ms Shiers' father Peter Shiers also read a statement which said: "That night was horrendous. But Jay has been a great guy to the family for 18 years. He's been an honest and loyal friend.
"We don't think he's to blame for the fire but was responsible for the safety measures."
Liptrot's defence barrister Gordon Cole said all of his client's other properties have now been brought up to the required safety standard but said he will never forget the events of that night.
Passing sentence, Mrs Justice McGowan said: "Jay Liptrot has generally been a good and conscientious landlord. However, his culpability must be categorised as high."
North Wales Fire and Rescue Service's chief fire officer Simon Smith said Liptrot would now be the subject of an internal investigation, adding a custodial sentence meant he "cannot continue as an employee".
"As a responsible employer whose priority is the safety of the public, it is of course of deep concern to us that an employee, as a landlord, failed to take precautions to ensure this property was safe which not only goes against legislation but also against the core values of our service," Mr Smith said.
