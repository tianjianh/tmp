The full-back for Pro12 side Scarlets appeared with four team-mates in fancy dress where he posed as Wilfried Bony.
Mr Williams was criticised by Show Racism the Red Card, which said it was "disappointed to see the image".
The photo has been removed and he said he was not a racist and there was "no malice behind it".
A statement from the Scarlets said: "Scarlets is fully committed to eradicating discrimination and promoting equality for both staff and our customers by treating people fairly and according to their needs.
"Scarlets is proud of its record in promoting equality and non-discriminatory behaviour amongst all our employees and this applies to the way we behave to members of the public and to other employees."
