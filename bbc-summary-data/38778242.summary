Aberdeen manager Derek McInnes is hopeful that Niall McGinn will sign a new deal to stay at the club.

The Northern Ireland international is out of contract in the summer and is considering his options.
McInnes says the club have made McGinn "a strong offer" to remain at Pittodrie, and hopes the player will still be there beyond the summer.
"We certainly hope Niall is part of the squad for next season," McInnes said after his side's 3-0 win over Dundee.
The Dons boss believes the temptation to try a new experience at a different club, rather than money, could be the key reason for McGinn's indecision over whether to stay at Aberdeen.
"We've made Niall what we feel is a strong offer," McInnes explained.

"It's not so much the contract offer for Niall. I think it's just maybe weighing up more what he wants to do next, whether he wants to stay for a bit longer, which we certainly hope is the case, or whether he wants to try something different.
"He's quite within his rights and we respect that. What is clear is Niall has never at any point said that he wants to leave.
"He's always indicated his love for the club and how much he's enjoying it. We're hoping that side of it, as well as a strong contract offer from us, will get the job done but everything will become a bit clearer for everybody over the next few weeks.
McGinn was in fine form as Aberdeen swept aside Dundee to move up to second in the Premiership.
The forward scored two and laid on the other in a terrific individual display that impressed his manager.
"We head to wait longer than we hoped to get in front but once we made the breakthrough we brought some real quality," said the Dons boss.
"Niall's first goal was top drawer. I thought it was a fantastic piece of individual play. It just comes out of nothing. He scored quality goals like that throughout his time here."
It was a difficult evening's viewing for Dundee manager Paul Hartley, who says his team made life too easy for the hosts.
"The start was promising but after that we didn't defend properly," Hartley said. "For us tonight not to defend balls coming in, they seemed to switch off and not do their jobs.
"We've got to do the basics properly. For me, we've got to try and make it as difficult as possible. We didn't do that.
"We want to try and bring some players in. It's not going to be easy. Financially it's going to be difficult. We've enquired about some players, we can't get them because of the financial side of it.
"We want to add quality and we need to add quality."
