Djokovic, the world number one, said he was unfit to play ahead of the final of the exhibition event on Saturday.
"I've been sick today with a fever and I'm not fit to play," said the Serb, who beat Switzerland's Stan Wawrinka 6-1 6-2 in the semi-final.
The Australian Open gets under way in Melbourne on 19 January.
Djokovic's withdrawal handed the Abu Dhabi title to Murray, who had looked in good form as he beat Feliciano Lopez in round one and then swept aside Rafael Nadal 6-2 6-0 in the semi-final on Friday.
Murray, 27, had revealed after that match that he felt pain in his left shoulder, but he was reassured by the results of a scan on Saturday.
"It's fine," he said. "There aren't any tears, just soreness."
After collecting the trophy, Murray confirmed that he would fly to Perth on Saturday and continue his build-up to the Australian Open at  next week's Hopman Cup.
The Scot will team up with Heather Watson to represent Great Britain at the mixed team event, with their opening match against France on Monday.
