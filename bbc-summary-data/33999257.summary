His exhibition is called Dismaland and features the work of lots of other famous artists.
The art works are all meant to look like the sorts of things you would normally expect from a theme park, but with a twist.
Banksy keeps his identity a secret and police and some local councils, think his work is graffiti and remove it.
But the owners of some of the buildings he has worked on make lots of money from selling it at auction.
This latest attraction by Banksy and his friends is his biggest event yet and is already attracting lots of people.
