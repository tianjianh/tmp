We would like you or any of your female friends or family who experience harassment between Friday 2 December and Sunday 4 December to share your story with us.
We only need a brief description of the incident and the city where it happened. Tweet it using the hashtag #mappingharassment or if you prefer, email bbc.100women@bbc.co.uk.
Do not put yourself at risk or try to take any pictures of the incident. Also do not give us further elements that could lead to your full identification, like your name, or address. Only post a brief description, the city and the hashtag.
