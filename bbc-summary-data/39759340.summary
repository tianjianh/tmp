Netball: Late Manchester rally denies Celtic Dragons

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Celtic Dragons came agonisingly close to claiming their second win of the season as they lost 55-53 to Manchester Thunder in the Netball Superleague.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Welsh team led at the end of the first and second quarters but Thunder's experience told in the later stages.
The scores were tied 51-all with two minutes to play, but Manchester took advantage of a miss shot to take the lead and run the clock down.
Celtic Dragons play Hertfordshire Mavericks on Monday, 1 May.
