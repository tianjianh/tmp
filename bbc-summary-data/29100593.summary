Thousands of people have welcomed the return of the Scottish Airshow to the skies above Ayrshire after a 22-year absence.

The two-day event was being held at Low Green, in Ayr, and at Prestwick Airport on Saturday and Sunday.
Highlights included a Vulcan bomber, the Blades aerobatic team as well as helicopter and parachute displays.
A planned flypast by two Lancaster bombers on Saturday had to be cancelled because of bad weather further south.
Heavy rain in Lincolnshire meant the planes were unable to take off.
In its heyday in the 1980s, the Scottish air show attracted up to 100,000 spectators to Prestwick.
Organisers said the revival would fill the gap left by the Leuchars Airshow which took place at the RAF base in Fife until last year.
The Scottish Airshow was put on in partnership with Homecoming Scotland and organisers hope it will become a regular event.
