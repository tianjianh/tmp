[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A shared space scheme in which vehicles and pedestrians have equal priority has been delayed amid concerns from visually-impaired people.

Work was due to begin on the project in the Stobhill area of Morpeth on Monday.
But after a protest by blind and visually impaired people in the area, Northumberland County Council has agreed to further consultation.
The authority is due to spend about Â£300,000 on the project.
As part of the plan, pavements, crossings and traffic lights would be removed from the Shields Road, First Avenue and Jobling Crescent areas of Stobhill.
The Northumberland Low Vision Action Group branded the scheme dangerous and said many visually impaired people would avoid the area.
Guide dog user Ace McCollum said: "I think people will have accidents. I think people will be afraid.
"I don't think the young drivers who rip round in their fancy cars are going to bother about people like me."
