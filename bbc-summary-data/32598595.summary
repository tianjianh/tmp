Developers PSL Land said they hoped the 86 acre site at Straiton would host a world-class production facility, film academy with student residence, visitor attraction and hotel.
The plans also include eight sound stages up to 70ft tall.
It is estimated the Â£135m development will create 600 jobs and open in 2017.
Keppie Design has designed the studio, which is planned for a site about four miles south of the city.
Jim O'Donnell, PSL Land development director, said: "We look forward to creating a world-class facility to complement Scotland's existing studio spaces and stunning locations.
"Situated on the outskirts of one of Europe's greatest cities, the proposed studio will place broadcast, indigenous and international film production needs at the forefront, whilst retaining the character and integrity of the local area and its natural beauty."
A Midlothian council spokesperson said: "The council has received a planning application in principle for a film and TV studio and other associated developments.
"As part of the planning assessment, we will undertake a neighbour notification and consultation process to seek the views of interested parties. We will be looking to determine the application later in the year.''
