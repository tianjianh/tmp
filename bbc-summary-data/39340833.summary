South Wales Police has instructed its community support officers to be aware of the spate of the "illegal" cat attacks around Gorseinon.
Tigger is the latest victim and his paw has become infected, which has angered owner Nicola Lewis.
"I can't believe someone would do something like this," said the 33-year-old. "I'm furious."
The RSPCA is investigating the "deeply worrying and disturbing reports" and has made a public appeal for further information.
"Declawing a cat is an illegal act which is classified as mutilation," said Keith Hogben, an inspector at the animal cruelty charity.
Ms Lewis only realised Tigger had fallen victim to the attacker after reading a warning on Facebook telling owners in the area to check the paws of their cats.
"I thought I had better check my cat and I discovered one of his claws was missing," she said.
"Then a few days later there was blood on the floor and it looks like the paw has become infected.
"My friend said the same thing had happened to her cat."
