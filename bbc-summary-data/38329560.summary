[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A Celtic fan, who joined the Edinburgh celebrations after Hibernian beat Rangers in the Scottish Cup Final, has been jailed for 16 months for  assault.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Anthony Lewis, 24, from Coatbridge, pleaded guilty last month to assaulting Rangers supporter Greg Elliot, 27, to his severe injury and permanent disfigurement by punching him.
The attack happened at Haymarket Station on 21 May.
He was sentenced at Edinburgh Sheriff Court.
Sheriff Fiona Tait heard that Lewis and a friend, another Celtic supporter, had been watching the Cup Final in a pub in Airdrie.
They decided to travel to Edinburgh by train to join in the celebrations.
Mr Elliot, who had been at the game, was also on the train and was wearing a Rangers' Football Club scarf.
At Haymarket, Lewis and his friend got off the train after Mr Elliot. As they were walking along Platform 3, Lewis punched Mr Elliot in the face, knocking him unconscious.
Lewis and his friend walked away. Mr Elliot was taken to the Royal Infirmary where he was found to have bruising and bleeding to the front of his brain and a cut on his head which needed five stitches. He was kept in the hospital for 12 hours.
He is likely to suffer quite significant migraines for the rest of his life.
Defence solicitor, Simon Whyte, told Sheriff Tait Lewis had been affected by alcohol, but he had handed himself in to the police.
He had a consistent work record and a stable background.
Sentencing Lewis, Sheriff Tait said: "While it was a single punch, you knocked him unconscious and you left him unconscious.
"Having regard to the circumstances of the offence I am not persuaded a non-custodial sentence is appropriate".
