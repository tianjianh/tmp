Winger Kay Wilson scored seven tries - a Women's Six Nations record - and Amy Cokayne got a hat-trick as England crossed 12 times at Twickenham Stoop.
Danielle Waterman and Emily Scarratt, who missed 10 of her 12 conversions, were the other try-scorers.
Ireland beat Wales 12-7 to set up a grand finale in Dublin on 17 March.
The world champions have not won the Six Nations since 2012, but the bonus-point win means they leapfrog Ireland into first place on points difference, going into Friday's decider.
England secured their bonus-point try in under 20 minutes as Wilson showed lightning pace and Amy Cokayne twice crossed from a line-out drive as Scotland chose not to compete at the set-piece.
England led 40-0 at the break and it was the first time since 2002 that a team had ran in eight tries in the first half of a Women's Six Nations match.
Scotland managed to improve slightly after the break but Wilson led the charge at the end as her side surpassed the 11 tries scored against Wales earlier in the tournament.
Scotland came into the game having beaten Wales 15-14 last month, their first win in the tournament since 2010.
But they were comprehensively outplayed and even turned to the Italy men's team's tactic of not competing at the breakdown in an attempt to stop the rout.
Their tactics fell short as England dominated in every area of the field and restricted Scotland to just two meaningful attacks in the first 40 minutes.
Scotland entered the England 22 for the first time on 53 minutes - and almost came away with seven points - but the television match official ruled Chloe Rollie had failed to ground the ball.
And England, having been sloppy for 20 minutes, eventually destroyed a tired Scotland defence.
Wilson said: "It was so much fun. As a team we wanted to build on last week's performance against Italy. We did our basics well and we're looking forward to Ireland next week."
