Uefa has confirmed the game - one of the biggest in European club football - will be held at the Millennium Stadium in 2017.
Prime Minister David Cameron praised the decision as "fantastic news".
Secretary of State for Wales Stephen Crabb said the fixture would bring with it "an economic boost that reaches the whole of Wales".
The Football Association of Wales (FAW) led the bid to host one of Uefa's major finals with support from the Welsh Rugby Union (WRU), and the owners of the Millennium Stadium.
Mr Crabb said the decision was "another ringing endorsement" of the Millennium Stadium's "credentials as a world class sporting venue".
"The FAW's bid has had the full backing of the UK government and we should be rightly proud of all the efforts that have gone into securing this pinnacle match," he said.
"Hosting this prestigious fixture is another opportunity for one of Europe's most exciting capital cities to shine in front of an audience of millions, bringing with it an economic boost that reaches the whole of Wales."
Mr Cameron called the stadium "one of the best in Europe" and added: "It is fantastic news that this has been recognised by Uefa and that the 2017 Champions League final will be in Cardiff."
UK Minister for Sport Tracey Crouch said: "I am pleased the UK government could help secure the biggest match in club football for Wales that will bring both economic and sporting benefits to the country."
