Bypass calls to tackle Llandeilo air pollution

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Carmarthenshire council wants action to be taken over air pollution in Llandeilo.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A motion asked why the Welsh Government is "not complying with their legal obligation" to reduce high levels of nitrogen dioxide in the town.
Full council voted to write to the government calling for a bypass, despite concerns most transport funding will be spent on an M4 relief road.
The Welsh Government has been asked to comment.
Cllr Edward Thomas put forward the motion.
He said: "The Welsh Government must recognise that the only viable solution is to commence detailed planning of a strategic road improvement as recommended by the several reports submitted by this council to Welsh Government."
