Two homes caught fire after being struck at about 02:05 BST on Saturday in Nelson Crescent, Longstanton.
One of the owners said he rushed up to the third floor, where his six-year-old son was sleeping, after hearing a "loud bang", before leaving the property.
It was "heartbreaking" to watch his home burn, he said. The roof and top floors of both homes were gutted.
Four crews from Cambridgeshire Fire and Rescue Service tackled the blaze.
At one point they were forced to withdraw as the roof was unstable. The fire service confirmed the blaze was caused by a lightning strike.
Neighbours rallied round to help the occupiers. Lucy Frost, who lives nearby the stricken homes, said they provided them with food and drink and took in the man's child.
"The place looks devastating, now," she said.
