It happened at El Fahes, about 60km (40 miles) south-west of the capital, Tunis, during the morning rush hour.
Eyewitnesses have described seeing mangled wreckage at the scene and dead bodies across the tracks.
Ambulances have been sent from neighbouring areas to the crash site to transport the wounded.
The number of dead could rise, Health Minister Said Aydi said.
"This is horrible, there is blood... everywhere," one witness told the private Shems-FM radio station, the AFP news agency reports.
"There are people still trapped under the carriage, which overturned."
The driver of the lorry who survived the accident is being questioned by police, a local official told the station.
