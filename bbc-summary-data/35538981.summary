Dublin: Thousands face disruption in Luas tram strike

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Thousands of commuters in Dublin face disruption over the next two days if a strike by workers on the Luas tram lines goes ahead.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Services, Industrial, Professional and Technical Union (Siptu) workers plan to stop work for 48 hours in a dispute over pay.
Both sides are being urged to re-engage to avoid strike action.
If there is no resolution, the strike is due to begin at 05:30 local time on Thursday.
Normal services would resume at 06:30 local time on Saturday.
Transdev, the private company that operates the Luas, said a workers' pay claim of up to 53% was not sustainable and would add 6m euros (£4.65m ) to its costs.
The union said its members believe they are underpaid, particularly when compared to workers doing similar jobs in Irish Rail.
Transport Minister Paschal Donohoe told Irish state broadcaster, RTÉ, on Wednesday that major efforts had been made to avert a strike.
He urged both sides to return to the Labour Court and called for reasonable negotiations.
