[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 23-year-old, who plays for Paris St-Germain, denies the charge and has himself filed a complaint against the police for violence, reports say.
He was originally arrested and placed in police custody early on Monday morning after an incident in Paris.
The incident occurred in the Champs Elysees area in the early hours of Monday as Aurier left a nightclub.
Paris St Germain officials said the club will wait for further information before making any comment.
Coach Laurent Blanc briefly suspended Aurier in mid-February after the defender posted a video online in which he insulted Blanc and fellow PSG players, including Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Angel di Maria.
