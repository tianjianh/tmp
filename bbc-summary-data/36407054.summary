Murray, 29, will be seeking a repeat of the form that saw him overcome Ivo Karlovic in the third round on Friday.
But Isner is a much stronger all-round player than Karlovic and has pushed Murray hard in previous meetings.
The match is scheduled third on Court Suzanne Lenglen but could be delayed because of rain.
The American, seeded 15th, accepts Murray would have benefitted from his match against Karlovic.
"He's definitely got some reps in against a pretty big serve," he said. "But my serve is a little bit different. I think I can back it up better, as well.
"He's played the big points better than me, which is one of the reasons why he's number two in the world. So I'm going to have to step up when I get opportunities - if I get them.
"It's a match I would love to win, and a match I believe I can win."
