Lukasz Robert Pawlowski, 33, had pleaded guilty to sexual assault by grabbing and kissing a shop assistant.
Pawlowski, of Bush Street, Pembroke Dock, was appearing for sentence at the Pembrokeshire court when the incident happened.
He has been taken to a Swansea hospital by air ambulance.
Following the incident, an emergency call was made from the court at 10:20 GMT.
It is unclear where and how Pawlowski gained access to the weapon. The court complex has airport-style security scanners and guards in place at both entrances.
It is understood he lost consciousness and blood after the incident. A Wales Ambulance Service spokesman described Pawlowski's injuries as "serious".
A Western Telegraph reporter was in court and witnessed the incident.
The online edition of the newspaper reported Pawlowski asked to leave the dock to go to the toilet, but when he returned he slit his throat.
They said: "He came into the dock, then asked to go to the toilet.
"He went out, came back, muttered something then started slashing at his throat.
"The court room was then cleared out, and first aid was given by paramedics in the dock."
Dyfed-Powys Police said: "Officers attended and found an injured man at the scene, who was receiving treatment by paramedics.
"He has been conveyed to Morriston Hospital by air ambulance. The extent of his injuries are unknown at this time. The court has been closed in order for inquiries to take place.
"Police are not looking to speak to anyone else in connection with this incident at this time."
An HM Courts and Tribunal spokesman said: "A man has been taken to hospital following an incident at Haverfordwest Magistrates' Court on Wednesday 11 January. There were no injuries to staff or other court users.
"There is an ongoing police investigation so it would be inappropriate to comment further at this stage."
Preseli Pembrokeshire MP Stephen Crabb tweeted his concern at the events, saying: "Disturbing news. No one should be in a position to harm themselves or others in a court room."
