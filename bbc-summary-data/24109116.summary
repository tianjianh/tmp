Relatives and friends of 13-year-old Lindsey Inger, who was killed by a tram in November, have campaigned for it.
Lindsey's foster mother said she was glad the bridge had finally been installed, but said it was too late to save her daughter's life.
A woman and her grandson were killed at the Moor Bridge crossing, in Nottinghamshire, in 2008.
Marlene Starling, Lindsey's foster mother, said: "If you see something and it's a danger you are going to make it so it's safe, so why have we had to lose all these lives before they've done it?
"But we are thankful now that they have anyway, so we are hoping and praying nobody's going to lose any more lives."
The Transport Salaried Staffs' Association (TSSA) union has accused Network Rail and the Office of Rail Regulation (ORR) of ignoring safety warnings 14 months before Lindsey was killed.
Network Rail said it had closed hundreds of level crossings because it recognised they can be dangerous, and safety features had been introduced at thousands of level crossings.
The ORR said it was pushing for the closure of level crossings where possible.
