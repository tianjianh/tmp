Non-League Day 2016: Five things you may have missed

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Though there may be no Premier League or Championship football to enjoy this weekend as the international break rolls around, fans of lower-league clubs have been celebrating the seventh annual Non-League Day.

With a full slate of fixtures in the National League, the National League North and South, and the FA Cup first qualifying round, there was no shortage of action to follow outside the EFL.
Here, BBC Sport picks five of the biggest stories you may have missed today.
The biggest winners of the day by quite some distance were Chippenham Town, who thumped Moneyfields FC 9-0 in front of a crowd of 252 people to keep alive their hopes of reaching the first round proper for the first time since 2005.
There were nine goals at Ashton Athletic too, where the hosts ran out 7-2 winners over Mossley AFC, while AFC Sudbury won 6-0 at home to Halstead.
Meanwhile, any hopes Dunkirk FC may have harboured of Wembley glory took a major hit when they conceded the first goal of the 15:00 kick-offs in the very first minute of their first qualifying-round tie at Lincoln Town, as Matt Cotton's shot put the hosts ahead.
And it was all downhill from there, with Town scoring a further five goals to seal their place in the next round and pick up the Â£3,000 prize money on offer.
While fans across the country were being treated to high-scoring action, some decided to take it upon themselves to generate the headlines.
Stockport brought an impressive support with them for their 3-2 National League North win at Altrincham, but the result was marred by a delay in play caused by a smoke-bomb being thrown onto the pitch at Moss Lane.
Unruly support also caused problems at Kellamergh Park, where AFC Fylde hosted Gloucester City in the same division, with six fans thrown out of the ground following a fight in the stands.
Fortunately, those still able to watch the game were treated to a good contest, as City twice came from behind to earn a very creditable 2-2 draw.
It's a grudge match that few will have heard of, but Buxton FC were out for revenge having lost all five of their previous FA Cup meetings with Witton Albion.
This year would surely be when they would finally end the hoodoo, with the Bucks leading the Evo-Stik Premier League and facing opposition one league below them in the First Division South.
Albion had other ideas, however, taking a 2-0 half-time lead with goals from Brad Bauress and Tom Owens, before Rob Hopley rubbed a bit more salt in the wound with his second-half effort.
In August 2007, Nicky Shorey's career could not have been going too much better, winning his second England cap against Germany and playing regular Premier League football with Reading.
Since then, the left-back has had spells with nine clubs, including National League South side Hungerford Town, who he joined on Friday following his release by Colchester in summer.
"He's not here for money," manager Bobby Wilkinson said of his new arrival.
"He's coming here to play and to help me out. He's a great lad and still a great player."
Shorey was left to watch from the sidelines on Saturday, as his new Crusaders team-mates played out a 1-1 draw at Margate.
Guiseley have endured a dreadful start to the National League season, losing their first seven league games and sacking manager Mark Bower after the fifth of those losses.
They finally earned their first point of the season at the third attempt under temporary boss Adam Lockwood, holding fellow strugglers Braintree to a 0-0 draw at Nethermoor.
The Lions are already six points adrift of safety at the foot of the table, having avoided relegation by just one point in their first season in the division last term.
