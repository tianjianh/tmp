Earlier, Joshua Bonehill-Paine, 23, of Yeovil, was found guilty of inciting racial hatred at Southwark Crown Court.
He posted links to offensive material on Twitter in June before a rally planned in Golders Green, north London, an area with a large Jewish population.
The event was later moved and held in central London.
Bonehill-Paine, who has described himself as "a rising star of the right-wing community" was arrested at his Yeovil home in Hudson Road on 26 June.
He was jailed for three years and four months and ordered to pay a victim surcharge of Â£120 and Â£1,200 in court costs.
Det Ch Insp Andy Barnes of the Met Police, who led the investigation, said Bonehill-Paine "posted vile, anti-Semitic material online".
He added: "There are challenges in attributing such material posted online to the originator but our digital forensic examiners worked tirelessly, carrying out extensive analysis of the material, phone data and online activity to prove that Bonehill-Paine posted the material from his laptop.
"The Met fully understands the hurt that is felt in communities affected by this type of crime.
"It is only by continually working with communities that we can ensure they are safe and free from fear."
In 2014 Bonehill-Paine admitted posting hoax messages about a pub in Leicester banning military personnel in a bid to generate racial tension.
He was given 180 hours of community service and a two-year supervision order for malicious communication.
