Police were called to reports of an altercation at Morrisons on Norwich Road, Wymondham, Norfolk, at 20:00 BST on Monday.
A local man in his 20s was treated by paramedics at the scene before being airlifted to hospital.
Three men in their 20s to mid-40s and a woman in her late teens, all from the local area, have been arrested.
Police said no weapons were used during the assault and believe all those involved are known to each other.
The supermarket was closed just after midnight for investigation work to be carried out.
A police officer stood guard outside the store and officers put up a cordon around a checkout near the battery aisle.
The store reopened as normal on Tuesday morning.
The victim is being treated at Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital.
