Dundee 7-0 Forfar Athletic

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Greg Stewart grabbed a double as Dundee eased to victory over Forfar Athletic, with both teams failing to make the next round of the league cup.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Paul McGowan and Michael Duffy fired the Dens Park side ahead before Stewart grabbed his first on the rebound.
Julen Etxabeguren made it 4-0 before Stewart fired his second - his sixth in three games.
Headers from Rory Loy and Yordi Teijsse capped a chastening day for the League Two visitors.
Stewart, who has been the subject of sustained speculation about his future, floated a ball through to McGowan who made a terrific run through the heart of the Forfar defence to clip the ball over the advancing Grant Adam.
Number two for the home side was a thing of beauty and came just after the half-hour mark.
On-loan Celtic striker Duffy decided to have a crack at goal from fully 35 yards and the ball thundered into the net off the underside of the crossbar. A magnificent strike by Duffy as the home fans come to terms with the departure of Kane Hemmings to Oxford United.
Another debutant for Dundee, Dutch striker Yordi Teijsse, also looked sharp and an acrobatic overhead kick was saved by Grant Adam in the Forfar goal low to his left hand post.
The game was over as a contest before the break when Stewart notched Dundee's third.
A header by Teijsse was blocked by Adam but Stewart was first to react and knock the ball home underneath the legs of the keeper.
The home side continued their pressure on the Forfar goal in the second half and goal number four came after 55 minutes.
Darren O'Dea knocked a header towards goal that was blocked by Adam but Extebeguren was there to tap the rebound into the empty net.
And the crowd were on their feet applauding when Stewart thundered the ball beyond Adam from fully twenty five yards out. A stunning goal.
The sixth goal duly came when a Cammy Smith cross was met by the head of substitute Rory Loy to nod the ball into the corner.
With two minutes left the scoring was complete when Teijsse completed a move he began in his own half, his header from close range wrapping up a comprehensive victory for Paul Hartley's side.
