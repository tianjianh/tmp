The 24-year-old, named supporters' player of the year last season, has extended her existing deal at the WSL 1 side by 18 months, until June 2019.
"I've been here five-and-a-half years and I'm so proud of how far the club has come in such a short space of time," Jane said.
The former Chelsea player made 18 appearances for the club last season.
