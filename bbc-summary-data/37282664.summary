[SN]TITLE[SN]
League One: Bristol Rovers 1-1 Walsall

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Walsall goalkeeper Neil Etheridge produced a string of fine saves to earn his side a 1-1 draw with Bristol Rovers at the Memorial Stadium.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The visitors took a 16th-minute lead when Hiram Boateng's poor touch on the edge of his own box set up Erhun Oztumer to curl a left-footed shot past Kelle Roos from 20 yards.
Rovers were level on 27 minutes after a foul by Adam Chambers on Billy Bodin. It was borderline whether it was inside the box, but Matt Taylor hammered in the resulting penalty for his sixth goal of the season.
Walsall had a loud penalty appeal of their own rejected when Simeon Jackson went down under challenge from Tom Lockyer in a first half that saw fine saves from both goalkeepers.
Former Rovers loanee Etheridge did brilliantly to keep out a deflected Taylor header, while Roos smothered a close-range effort from Jackson after a superb through-ball from Oztumer.
In the second half Etheridge made more superb stops from Taylor and Bodin twice as Rovers piled on the pressure.
