Calvin Marchant, 48, was diagnosed with acute pancreatitis by doctors at the Royal Devon and Exeter Hospital.
Assistant coroner Lydia Brown said there were a number of errors and omissions that contributed to his death in January 2015.
The hospital said it had "carried out a full internal investigation" and "taken a number of actions".
Lawyers for his family said there were "missed opportunities" by the hospital.
Mr Marchant died on 3 January, a Saturday, after getting up out of his ward bed, disconnecting his oxygen supply and collapsing in a main corridor.
The coroner ruled there was an absence of a weekend management plan, inadequate monitoring, failure to allocate him a correct consultant and an absence of further clinical examination and review.
She said Mr Marchant, from Sidmouth, Devon, was in a confused state when he removed the oxygen he was on and left the ward and collapsed.
He died from acute cardio respiratory failure, vomiting, and pneumonia which had developed in the days before his death.
The coroner said: "There were enough nurses. He was in the right place. But one-to-one nursing was not utilised."
The coroner added she would not be making any recommendations because the Trust had conducted a thorough investigation and "no stone has been left unturned".
Afterwards Mr Marchant's family said: "We cannot accept claims by hospital staff that Calvin appeared to be coherent and doing well during his final days.
"When we spoke with him we found him to be very confused and unable to hold a conversation.
"Despite our raising this with the nursing staff, this aspect of his condition seems to have been ignored."
A hospital spokesman said it had "taken a number of actions including strengthening our clinical handover process" following Mr Marchant's death.
