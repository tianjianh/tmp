[SN]TITLE[SN]
Michael McLaughlin: Londonderry man offered ex-wife 'bribe'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A 52-year-old man who tried to bribe his ex-wife has been put on probation for two years at Londonderry Crown Court and ordered not to contact her for the next five years.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Michael McLaughlin, from Hollymount Park, Londonderry, offered his ex-wife Â£13,000 not to give criminal evidence against him in a trial.
On 3 February, two days before his ex-wife was due to give evidence against him, Michael McLaughlin offered her the money by text message.
The father of four was married for 12 years and had 37 previous convictions, most of them for domestic-related issues.
Michael McLaughlin pleaded guilty to a charge of attempting to pervert the course of justice.
The judge said that his offending had caused his ex-wife great distress and the five-year restraining order also related to his ex-wife's new partner.
