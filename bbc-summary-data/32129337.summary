The wife and adult children of late actor Robin Williams have agreed to meet outside of court to try and resolve a dispute over his belongings.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A judge has instructed lawyers to take eight weeks to work out disagreements over money and property, including clothes, photographs and movie awards.
Widow Susan Schneider Williams wants the contents of her home to be excluded from items left to his three children.
They were married for five years until the actor's suicide in August 2014.
Schneider Williams filed court papers in December claiming some of her husband's personal items had been taken from the home they shared in Tiburon, California. without her permission.
However his daughter Zelda Williams said in a post on the blogging site Tumblr that she and brothers Zachary and Cody - Williams' children from previous marriages - had not visited the address since their father's death or removed anything from it.
Schneider Williams is seeking items including the tuxedo her husband wore to their 2011 wedding and art and furniture that were wedding gifts.
There is also a dispute over allowances to maintain the house, where she still lives.
Other items under discussion include clothing, watches, photos taken prior to Williams' marriage and memorabilia - including his 1998 Oscar for Good Will Hunting.
San Francisco Superior Court Judge Andrew Cheng told lawyers for both sides to meet before 10 April and enlist the help of a mediator if necessary before returning to court on 1 June.
One of the trustees for the estate, Andrew A Bassak, told the judge that the comedian had decided to establish trusts for his heirs and had never meant for a list of possessions to be debated over in public.
Schneider Williams' attorney, James Wagstaffe, told the judge: "We're amicable and no one is raising their voices. It's just that there are 1,200 items on a long spreadsheet which we saw in final form only last week."
Outside court Wagstaffe told reporters: "Robin Williams didn't mean for the house to be gutted, furniture removed and art taken off the walls.
"This is a normal process and there's nothing unusual about this. If the estate is a lake, what Susan is seeking is a bucket."
Williams' children said Schneider Williams was "adding insult to a terrible injury" by trying to change the trust agreement and rob them of items that their father clearly intended them to have.
"This has dragged on so long," their lawyer Meredith Bushnell told the judge.
"It's been eight long months since his passing. We'd like to see this wrapped up as soon as possible so they can move on with their lives and continue the grieving process."
