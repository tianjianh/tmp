The 26-year-old, who joined Manchester City in 2015 but did not play a game, is the Magpies' second summer signing after winger Christian Atsu.
Former France youth international Lejeune has also had spells at Girona and Villarreal.
"When you have a manager like Rafa Benitez who wants you, you are very happy to come," he said.
Benitez added: "If he settles well into English football then I am sure he will be a success and will give us a lot of competition in this area."
