Jack Cork headed the Clarets in front, converting Robbie Brady's cross.
Republic of Ireland international Brady then weaved through to fire past Rovers keeper David Raya in added time at the end of the first half.
A spectator ran onto the pitch after Cork's opener and confronted some Burnley players before being removed.
League One side Blackburn started the game brightly against their Premier League opponents, but faded after Cork's opener.
Burnley's record signing Chris Wood, who joined from Leeds for a reported Â£15m this week, made his debut as a first-half replacement for Jon Walters, who had received lengthy treatment for an ankle injury early on.
The New Zealand striker drew a good save from Raya just before Brady's strike.
Burnley have now won four successive east Lancashire derbies against their rivals, having previously gone 35 years without victory between 1979 and 2014.
