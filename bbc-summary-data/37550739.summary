England 8-1 Germany: U17s thrash rivals in Croatia Cup win

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
English football has endured a turbulent week in which Sam Allardyce left as manager of the senior national side after 67 days - but it can at least celebrate thrashing an old rival.

Steve Cooper's under-17s squad cruised to an 8-1 victory over Germany in the Croatia Cup on Monday.
The Young Lions took a 6-1 lead within the first 40 minutes of the game.
Manchester United's Angel Gomes found the net after four minutes, followed by goals from six different players.
Jadon Sancho of Manchester City got the second four minutes later, followed by two goals from Liverpool's Rhian Brewster. Phil Foden (Manchester City), George McEachran, Callum Hudson-Odoi (both Chelsea) and Danny Loader (Reading) all added to the scoreline.
Germany, with the score already 2-0, pulled one back through Luca Schlax in the 12th minute.
The match had to be contested at a local training ground after torrential rainfall rendered the pitch at Pula's Aldo Drosina Stadium unplayable.
It is the team's third victory in the competition, after beating hosts Croatia 5-0 and Greece 3-0 last week.
The squad are preparing for the first qualifying round of the 2017 European Championship in Croatia.
There are two qualifying rounds, with England due to play Romania, Azerbaijan and Austria later in October. All of England's matches in the first qualifying group will be held in Romania.
