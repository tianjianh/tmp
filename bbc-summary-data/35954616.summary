The world number seven claimed eight consecutive frames on his way to a 10-4 victory over Walden, 33, who is three places below him in the rankings.
It was the second final in a week for Walden, who lost 10-6 to Mark Allen in the Players Championship last Sunday.
Bristol-born Trump, 26, won the first of his five ranking titles in Beijing in 2011 at the age of 21.
Walden had found himself 3-1 up, but Trump began to dominate the match and raced into an 8-3 lead.
A run of 69 helped Trump pull further ahead, and, although Walden rescued one frame to make it 9-4, Trump sealed victory in the next with a break of 55.
Trump claimed the £85,000 top prize, while Walden picked up £35,000.
The China Open is the penultimate event of the season, and builds up to World Snooker Championship which starts on 16 April in Sheffield.
