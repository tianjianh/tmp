[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A fishing vessel contacted the UK Coastguard just after 07:00 BST on Thursday saying they had seen a body in the water just outside Aberystwyth Harbour.
Police, the ambulance service, the RNLI and the lifeboat all attended and the body was brought to shore.
Dyfed-Powys Police is making enquiries to identify the man.
Police said the discovery was not related to an incident on Wednesday when a man died after an empty speedboat was spotted circling in the harbour.
