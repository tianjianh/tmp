England's Lauren Winfield (44) and Sri Lanka's Chamari Atapattu (41) survived several dropped chances to put on 72 for Yorkshire's first wicket.
Katherine Brunt and Alice Davidson-Richards accelerated late on to get the hosts to 162-4 from their 20 overs.
Davidson-Richards then took 3-20 as Lancashire were restricted to 134-7.
New Zealand's Amy Satterthwaite top-scored for Thunder with 28 off 26 balls, but the efforts of Katie Levick (3-30) and Davidson-Richards with the ball meant the visitors were always well behind their required run rate.
Yorkshire and Lancashire finished fifth and sixth of the six teams in the inaugural competition last year, both winning only one of their five group games.
