Archaeologists discover an ancient mummy in Peru

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Archaeologists in Peru have uncovered a 4,500-year-old mummy that experts hope will help them to learn more about an ancient civilisation called 'Caral'.

The discovery was made in Aspero, an ancient fishing village in Northern Peru, in South America.
The director of the Caral Archaeological zone, said that the mummy was probably a woman, aged between 40 or 50.
She was buried with objects carved with images like birds and monkeys, which suggest she was probably an important rich-woman.
