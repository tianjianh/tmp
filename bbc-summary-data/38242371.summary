The Glasgow club said the employee, who is now dead, had worked at Partick for two years.
When the alleged abuse was raised in 1992, he was dismissed "with immediate effect", the club said.
Police Scotland and the Scottish Football Association have been informed.
In a statement, Partick Thistle said: "As far as Thistle's current management can ascertain, no other allegations were made to the club at that time with regard to him or any other employee.
"The club has contacted the SFA and Police Scotland to advise them of what they know to date and will fully comply with any investigation."
"In the meantime, Partick Thistle would urge anyone who may have been affected to contact Police Scotland, the SFA, the club or the NSPCC helpline (0800 0232642) set up to support and advise victims of abuse.
"In the last 24 hours, we have been approached by an anonymous individual asking for advice on who to contact with concerns relating to historic events. No details were given. The club advised he ring the NSPCC hotline in line with SFA guidance."
The club added that it regarded the safety and wellbeing of the children and young people who have contact with the club as being of "paramount importance".
