A Tesco worker who emailed himself copies of customer details from the supermarket giant's database has been fined.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Thomas Wengierow, 47, admitted a charge under the Data Protection Act committed when he worked at the company's Baird Avenue centre in Dundee.
Dundee Sheriff Court heard he knowingly or recklessly obtained or disclosed personal data from a Tesco database.
Wengierow then copied the details into an email and sent it to himself.
Solicitor David Duncan, defending, said: "It is an unusual offence but nonetheless serious.
"It seems to have come at a time when he was losing his grip on his life.
"He was unfulfilled and unhappy in his employment and went on this strange adventure as a result.
"He is now unemployed and he's going to have to try and get back on track."
Sheriff Lorna Drummond QC fined Wengierow Â£230 and told him: "You can't use information in the way that you did."
