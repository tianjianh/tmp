Salford led twice through Junior Sa'u's brace, but Mike McMeeken's two scores and another from Jake Webster gave the Tigers a 18-12 advantage at half-time.
Denny Solomona (twice) and Paul McShane crossed after half-time for the hosts, with Robert Lui replying.
Castleford, the 2014 finalists, are into Sunday's quarter-final draw.
Solomona's first score early in the second half was awarded by on-field official James Child and video referee Richard Silverwood, despite later television replays showing the Tigers winger had failed to ground the ball correctly.
Salford's Challenge Cup exit was compounded by the loss of Sa'u, who took his tally of tries to eight in three matches, to a head injury midway through the second half.
The centre collided with team-mate Gareth O'Brien while attempting to stop McShane's try, a score that took Castleford to a 10-point lead which they did not relinquish.
Salford, who are in the process of appealing against a six-point deduction for breaching salary cap rules, must now concentrate on finishing in Super League's top eight.
With 10 matches left to play before the start of the Super 8s, they are five points behind eighth-placed Castleford.
Castleford's Paul McShane: "Our togetherness is there for all to see week in and week out, and today proved it.
"We've got some key players missing but Daryl Powell has told us to keep things simple and it worked for us.
"These boys are hungry after missing out in the final the other year, so to get there this year would be amazing."
