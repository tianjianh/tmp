Swansea City striker Fernando Llorente says they must be more aggressive to avoid Premier League relegation.

The Spaniard was speaking after Saturday's 3-0 defeat at Middlesbrough left the Swans second from bottom.
Match of the Day pundit Danny Murphy criticised Swansea's recent form, saying they "lacked tenacity".
"If we battle, fight, be aggressive, we can be in a good situation, like [in their 3-0 win] at Sunderland," Llorente told BBC Radio Wales Sport.
Llorente joined compatriot Angel Rangel in emphasising the importance of festive home games with Bournemouth and West Ham.
"The games at the Liberty will be so important, we have to win the next two games though, or the situation will be bad," Llorente said.
"We need work, work, work, nothing more.
"All the players together have to be a strong unit.
"We have to react now. This final month of the year is important, we need to win the next two matches."
The World Cup winner admits defeat to a potential relegation rival at the weekend was a bitter blow to the Swans' chances.
"Yeah, it is a difficult moment, because today was a very important day, like a final," he said.
"They (Middlesbrough) are one of the clubs with us. And we started very well in the match.
"But then, with the first goal, the team gets down.
"Then the huge second goal, it makes it difficult. But we have to continue the work and try to improve the things we are doing badly."
