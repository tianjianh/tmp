The 1960s-set drama, based on Philip Roth's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel, premiered at the Toronto film festival.
McGregor also stars in the film, alongside Jennifer Connelly and Dakota Fanning.
Speaking to the BBC, McGregor said: "On the one hand it's been the most incredible experience and I would long to do it again.
"And on the other hand, it's a very costly experience - 16,17,18 months of your life - carrying something very precious."
He highlighted the challenge of juggling directing with "trying to be a husband and a father and a human being".
"It's quite a costly thing to do," he said. "I can only assume that's why it's taken me 15 years of wanting to do it, to do it."
The Scottish star said he needed a story he was "burning to tell" to justify that commitment.
"I hope very much to find the next story. I'm not going to rush into it. I hope the story will find me or I find the story and that I do get the opportunity to do it again."
In American Pastoral, McGregor plays a successful businessman whose seemingly perfect family life falls apart after his daughter Merry (Fanning) becomes politically radicalised.
The actor admitted he had been "very nervous" about taking on the directing role but was sure he had the film-making experience to carry it off.
McGregor revealed that one tip he had learned from Danny Boyle, who directed him in Trainspotting, was to rehearse with the actors alone on the set before shooting.
McGregor will be seen in Boyle's Trainspotting 2 next year.
"As an actor we have a unique position in that we do witness lots of directors," McGregor said.
"Directors don't really get to see other directors' work. Danny Boyle doesn't spend an awful lot of time on Martin Scorsese's film sets."
The Toronto International Film Festival runs until 18 September.
