Floyd Ayite put the hosts ahead from close range, but the Latics drew level when Scott Malone turned Stephen Warnock's cross into his own net.
Michael Jacobs slid in Max Power's cross to put the visitors ahead in first-half stoppage-time.
Denis Odoi's superb 35-yard shot found the bottom corner for Fulham and Kebano curled home in a dramatic finish.
Fulham, looking to extend a club record 16-match unbeaten run against Wigan, started brightly but the visitors fought back and could have been further ahead at half-time after Omar Bogle hit the side-netting with only keeper David Button to beat.
Wigan lost goalkeeper Jakob Haugaard to injury at half-time, with Matt Gilks taking over, but again went close to a third goal when Bogle was denied by Button.
Sone Aluko hit the crossbar with a shot for the hosts before Odoi's stunning strike levelled the scores.
The match looked likely to become the 11th draw between the sides in the last 17 meetings until Kebano struck on his return from Africa Cup of Nations duty with DR Congo.
Fulham move up a place to ninth - within six points of the play-off places - following their win, while Wigan remain next to bottom and five points from safety.
Fulham boss Slavisa Jokanovic:
"I can be proud about my team on one hand that we scored goals and won the game, but on the other hand I am really disappointed with some parts of the game.
"We have to be more solid, we did not show enough of a good attitude, and we did not play well without the ball.
"At 1-1 it can be a simple lottery, they can win the game too. Then we scored the goals and we go home satisfied with the points. But I am not satisfied with what we offered today."
Wigan manager Warren Joyce:
"It's bitterly disappointing, we didn't deserve to lose. At 2-1 we were comfortable, really. It was a rush of blood, the free-kick for Fulham's equaliser was avoidable.
"It was a silly free-kick to give away. It was a long way out but we were not organised. It was a poor goal to give away.
"It didn't rattle us, we kept going even though the home crowd is up for it, and I still think we had good opportunities."
