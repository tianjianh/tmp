NHS Grampian has been issued with a series of improvement notices over its performance in preventing infections, injuries and falls.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Health and Safety Executive (HSE) issued six improvement notices to the health board, following inspections at hospitals in Aberdeen and Elgin.
It said measures to prevent the spread of hepatitis B were not strong enough.
It also said more training was needed in the safe handling of sharp equipment.
Work was also needed in the prevention of patients suffering falls, the HSE said.
It followed inspections carried out in July at Aberdeen Royal Infirmary, the children's and maternity hospitals, Aberdeen's Woodend Hospital, the Aberdeen Health and Care Village, and Dr Gray's Hospital in Elgin.
NHS Grampian said staff were working hard to implement the improvements required, and a number of staff briefings had taken place.
A spokesperson said: "We have accepted the need for action and given a commitment to addressing the issues which started immediately on the receipt of the feedback.
"We have been impressed at the level of engagement around this issue."
