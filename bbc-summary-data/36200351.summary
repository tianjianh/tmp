Norwich were relegated to the Championship despite a thumping victory over Watford at Carrow Road.

Sunderland's 3-0 win over Everton consigned the Canaries to the second tier, as they are now four points from safety with just one game remaining.
Troy Deeney had given Watford the lead, but Norwich responded through Nathan Redmond's strike, Dieumerci Mbokani's tap-in and a Craig Cathcart own goal.
Odion Ighalo pulled a goal back, but Mbokani dinked in Norwich's fourth.

BBC Radio 5 live In Short: I feel I've let Norwich fans down - Neil
Although Alex Neil's side came from behind to score four - and hitting the post twice - against Watford, the damage had been done before the match.
The Canaries went into the game on the back of a four-game winless run in which they had not scored, and their top-flight destiny was out of their own hands.
It had looked good for Norwich on 2 April when they beat Newcastle - who also go down - but their poor recent form saw them drop into the relegation zone.
Before this game, they had scored just 35 goals in 36 games, conceding 62, with deficiencies in defence their downfall - demonstrated again by John Ruddy's fumble which allowed Deeney to net the opener.
At the full-time whistle, the Norwich players were given a round of applause by the home supporters, with one hugging boss Neil as he left the pitch.
Despite avoiding relegation and reaching the FA Cup semi-final, there have been doubts about the future of Watford boss Quique Sanchez Flores.
Having performed brightly until February, their form has tailed off - with two wins from their past 11 league games.
The slump coincided with Ighalo's loss of form, although the Nigerian finally ended a run of 12 league games without a goal when he slotted in Deeney's cutback in the second half.
Despite going in front, the Hornets were awful on the whole at Carrow Road. Midfielder Mario Suarez struggled badly, while keeper Heurelho Gomes was beaten at the near post for Norwich's opener.
The third goal was a calamity of errors as Allan Nyom slipped while trying to incept the ball, as Cathcart followed up Wes Hoolahan's cross by poking into his own net.

Norwich boss Alex Neil: "It is severe disappointment. The story for us is that, as a club, we have dropped short for a variety of reasons. We have made vital errors in games at crucial times and the recruitment has not been as good to strengthen the squad.
"I am here to do a job, the club will be bigger than me and I am not fearing for my job."

Watford boss Quique Sanchez Flores: "If we didn't worked really hard in the season then we may have been in Norwich's position. The level between Norwich and Watford is not too much. We recognise we have a good season.
"We will resolve my situation very quickly. We have enjoyed the season and the teams at the bottom have fought very hard recently. We didn't have that pressure."
Norwich have just pride to play for on Sunday at Everton, while Watford will look to end the season on a high at home to Sunderland (both at 15:00 BST).
