For the first time in their history, Wales moved above England in September's Fifa world rankings.
Roy Hodgson's men have already reached the Euro 2016 finals, while Wales need one point from their remaining two qualifiers to secure their place.
"There will be a bit of banter between me and some of my (English) team-mates at Arsenal. It is always a great game, a committed game," Ramsey said.
"I have been involved in two before. So yeah, why not play them? If it does happen, it will be a great game."
Should Wales qualify for France, it opens the prospect of both sides being drawn against each other in the group stage at the 24-team tournament.
The old rivals could also choose to arrange a friendly as part of their preparations for the finals. England are already scheduled to face France and Germany in friendlies before the tournament.
Wales are yet to arrange any friendly games for next year.
The most recent games between the two side came during the Euro 2012 qualifiers, when England won 2-0 in Cardiff and 1-0 at Wembley in 2011.
Wales' last success was a 1-0 win in Wrexham in 1984, which was only their 14th win in 101 attempts.
A goalless draw with Israel in Cardiff on Sunday meant Wales could not yet celebrate qualification.
The result means Chris Coleman's men need a point in their remaining games in October away to Bosnia-Herzegovina and at home to Andorra.
But Wales striker Hal Robson-Kanu believes they were wrongly denied an opportunity to seal qualification against Israel when the additional official behind the goal line failed to award a penalty when defender Eitan Tibi appeared to handle the ball in the second half.
"It was a blatant handball," said the 26-year-old Reading forward, who was being marked by Tibi when the defender touched the ball.
"I was shocked to see the official standing so close, so it was surprising he didn't give it, but it was just one of those days.
"The official I was looking at - he obviously didn't want to put his neck on the line and if he had done he would have made the right decision, but there you go."
Wales remain unbeaten in eight matches and top of the qualifying group, and Robson-Kanu is confident they will finish the job and qualify for the finals of a major tournament for the first time since 1958.
"We'll be fully focused on getting the job done and I'm sure we will," he added on BBC Radio Wales Sport.
"And when we get there we'll be looking to achieve something special."
