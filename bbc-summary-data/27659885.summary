Melanie Lakin, from Glascote, Tamworth, died in a collision on the A458 Llanfair Caereinion to Welshpool road on Sunday.
Her family said she was returning from a picnic at Bala lake with her boyfriend on separate motorbikes.
Ms Lakin's death has been voluntarily referred to the police watchdog.
Dyfed-Powys Police voluntarily referred the case to the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) because a police vehicle was nearby at the time of the crash.
A marked police motorcyclist was conducting vehicle checks in the area and police say a number of cars were stopped in a line of traffic behind the stationary vehicles.
Initial investigations show the motorcyclist collided with a car in the line of traffic.
The crash happened at about 16:30 BST.
In a statement, Ms Lakin's family said she was "a keen motorcyclist who loved life, people, nature and animals especially her cats Hector and Cleo".
She has completed her first year in diagnostic radiography at Birmingham City University and was looking forward to a successful career in the NHS "combining her love of helping people and a technical, visual subject".
"She had a keen eye and appreciation for photography, music and art and managed to combine all three on many occasions by photographing some of her favourite bands and musicians at music festivals," the family's statement added.
They said she would be sorely missed by her mother Pam, father Nigel, brother Jody, his partner Elena, boyfriend Oliver and the many friends and colleagues who had known her.
