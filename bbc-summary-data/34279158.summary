Steve Coogan's character posed the question "what do you think about the pedestrianisation of Norwich city centre?" during an intimate scene in I'm Alan Partridge in 1997.
Eighteen years later, the council has approved plans to pedestrianise more parts of the city.
All Saints Street and Westlegate could be closed to traffic by 2017.
Under the plans, Red Lion Street will be open only to buses, cycles and taxis - apart from deliveries.
In the episode of the BBC comedy, Partridge said: "I'll be honest, I'm dead against it. People forget that traders need access to Dixons.
"They do say it will help people in wheelchairs."
Norwich actually lays claim to being the first city in the country to fully pedestrianise a road - London Street in 1967.
In July, a virtual tour was released, showing what Norwich's city centre could look like after the Â£2.5m redevelopment.
Work is due to start in January.
