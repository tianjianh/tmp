Leslie Sedibe, former South African Football Association chief executive, has been banned from football-related activities for five years.
He has also been fined Swiss Francs 20,000 (Â£14,100).
Two former Safa referees' chiefs, Steve Goddard and Adeel Carelse, have each received two-year bans.
The sanctions relate to the proceedings against Lindile Kika, who last October was banned from all football-related activity for six years. Kika denied being involved in match-fixing.
Fifa found the officials guilty of infringements of its code of ethics relating to general rules of conduct, loyalty and duty of disclosure.
All bans come into force immediately.
The South African FA said it welcomed the sanctions.
"We are glad this matter has ultimately reached this stage since Safa reported the matter to Fifa almost four years ago," said Poobalan Govindasamy, chairman of the Safa ethics committee.
"It had dragged on too long for our liking and was starting to have an impact on us as an association and our valued stakeholders.
"At Safa we have a zero-tolerance policy for any corrupt activity which impacts negatively on this beautiful game and for that reason we welcome strong measures against any individual who is found guilty of such offenses."
