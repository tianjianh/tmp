A man who violently abused three female partners over a 15-year period has been jailed at the High Court in Edinburgh.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Fraser MacDonald, 45, was sentenced to six years and four months for the series of offences.
The court heard they took place in Edinburgh and West Lothian between 2001 and 2016.
Police Scotland said MacDonald had "proven himself to be a violent and callous individual".
Det Insp Kevin Harkins said: "As a result of the courage of his victims in coming forward and providing their testimony, combined with the evidence gathered during police inquiries, he is now going to jail for a significant length of time.
"This custodial sentence will hopefully send a message that domestic abuse will not be tolerated and every report to Police Scotland will be thoroughly investigated."
He added: "Police Scotland is committed to tackling domestic violence and associated offences through the Domestic Abuse Investigation Unit.
"I hope this sentence will give his victims some sense of closure and of justice being done.
"Victims coming forward to report crimes of this nature can rest assured that they will be treated with the utmost sensitivity, compassion and professionalism."
