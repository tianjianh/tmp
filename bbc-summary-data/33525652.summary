Suffolk MP tells BT superfast broadband must go faster

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Was Dr Dan Poulter MP speaking for many businesses and households in the region when he called on BT to "go further and faster and more quickly" when there is capacity?

"That should be something which is enabled and encouraged, not slowed down by BT," he told the House of Commons on Tuesday evening.
The MP for Central Suffolk and North Ipswich had called a debate about the roll out of superfast broadband which he called: "The single most important issue facing rural Suffolk and many rural businesses and homes."
Many schools and farmers in his constituency were served by poor broadband provision, he told MPs. Some places had been waiting for more than two years for superfast broadband, while those who had it found that it didn't live up to its name.
Suffolk and Norfolk were two of the first counties in the country to sign up to the superfast broadband roll out: a deal between the government, county councils and BT to provide better broadband to homes and villages in rural areas.
Dr Poulter conceded that the scheme is going well with 100,000 new properties due to be upgraded by this September, but his concern was that BT was dragging its feet and was slow to prioritise coverage in hard to reach areas.
"Suffolk has had issues with getting BT to prioritise coverage of industrial estates and business parks which are vital to the Suffolk economy," he said.
"In general BT tend to ignore Suffolk's priorities in favour of their own." Other MPs from Suffolk agreed.
Peter Aldous (Waveney) claimed BT had under invested in its commercial roll-out. His colleague Jo Churchill (Bury St Edmunds) called superfast connectivity "the fourth utility".
He said: "It disables our constituents if we do not give them the facility."
Dr Poulter had another gripe which many broadband users may also share - "superfast broadband is only superfast at times of low usage," he said.
"Businesses will obviously be using the internet and broadband services at peak times and if the superfast broadband service they have bought into is not superfast, then it is not fit for the purpose for which it was intended."
This is not the first time that MPs from the East have expressed concern about the speed of the broadband roll out and the role of BT.
Several from the region were present at another Westminster debate a few weeks ago on the provision of broadband in the South West. South Norfolk MP Richard Bacon expressed his frustration with BT by accusing the company of "talking crap".
The Culture Minister Ed Vaizey told this week's debate he was unstinting in his praise for BT but believed "it does have some problems with customer service".
He added that it was slow to keep its promises and explain to customers why delays occur.
"When BT gets on the ground and does the mapping exercises, it might find that getting to a particular village is more complicated than it had thought, so it revises its plan," he said.
This, he accepted, caused "great consternation" and he said BT should be better at keeping customers informed. Although he added that people should remember: "We cannot deliver it overnight."
A spokesman for BT told us:" We are committed to making superfast fibre broadband as widely available across Suffolk as quickly as possible.
"It's a huge task with around 100 engineers and support staff involved, and we have already connected 367 green roadside fibre broadband cabinets and laid more than 1,700km of fibre cable".
