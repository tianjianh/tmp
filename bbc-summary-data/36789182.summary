Cummings, 20, has scored 48 goals over the past three seasons, including 25 last term.
"I am delighted to have signed the new deal with Hibernian," said the Scotland Under-21 cap.
"There was never any doubt in my mind over where I wanted to be this season, and I'm relieved to get it over the line."
Last season's Scottish Cup winners Hibs begin their competitive campaign with a Europa League second qualifying round first-leg tie against Danish side Brondby on Thursday evening.
And Neil Lennon's side play their first Championship game of the new season away to Falkirk on 6 August.
"I feel my game has developed a lot over the last few seasons, and I'm looking forward to continuing to progress under the new manager," added Cummings.
"Everyone is buzzing after the Scottish Cup win, from the players to the supporters, and I'm sure we can achieve more over the coming years."
Speaking ahead of the announcement of the deal, Lennon said: "He had a great season last year. I like the kid, he has a very infectious personality.
"I think it will be good for him to stay another year here, mature and improve his game, but he has really good attributes already."
