Ospreys defence coach Brad Davis says he remains upbeat despite recent blows to their ambitions of a home draw in the Pro12 play-off semi-finals.

Ospreys are third in the Pro12 table following a narrow 20-18 defeat by Leinster on Saturday.
With three games left they seem likely to face an away trip to either Munster or Leinster in the play-offs.
"I'm really positive in the fact, that we are completely in charge of our affairs," said Davis.
Losing at home to Leinster was preceded by a shock 13-5 loss at Italian strugglers Treviso.
Against Leinster, Wales fly-half Dan Biggar missed a late penalty to win the game and later said he was "dazed" at the time following a blow to the head.
Biggar is being monitored for concussion ahead of their Pro12 Judgement Day game against Cardiff Blues at Cardiff's Principality Stadium on Saturday.
Davis added: "If someone had asked me at the start of the season whether with three games to go you'd be two points clear at third position I would have snapped their hand off and said 'I'll take that'."
He also remains upbeat in the event of going away to either Leinster or Munster in the last four.
"I think there are going to be a few more little permutations that are going to happen between now and then," the Australian said.
