[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Fundraiser Derek Russell, 53, who regularly helped himself to collection cash, was reported to police by wife Jacqueline.
Russell, of Clover Court in Willesborough, Kent, stole £605 from the Royal British Legion.
He was given a six-month sentence, suspended for two years, and ordered to repay the money.
Magistrates in Folkestone also sentenced him to 250 hours' community service.
Russell organised the annual appeal in Ashford from 2014 until November last year, collecting money on the streets and knocking on people's doors.
The court heard how the father-of-three, who had recently lost his job, regularly helped himself to £10 and £20 notes last year.
He spent the money on a mobile phone, dolls and a pram.
Emma Wright, defending, said he had been under great stress after losing his cleaning job, and had wanted to support his young family.
"He bitterly regrets what he's done. He's absolutely ashamed and disgusted in himself for betraying the trust invested in him," she told the court.
Russell said: "I've betrayed the trust to (sic) the Royal British Legion, and I'm very, very sorry."
Mrs Russell said "It was very hard for me to drop my husband in it."
