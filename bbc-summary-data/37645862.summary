The NI deer population are 'sensitive creatures, easily spooked'

Deer are not an uncommon sight in rural Northern Ireland, but in built up areas like Newry, County Down, they are a rare image indeed.

The appearance of a single stag on the loose in the city on Thursday may be linked to the fact that the rutting season reaches its peak in the first two weeks of October.
"Young males are chased by older ones in the bid to mate with the females at this time of year," said USPCA spokesman David Wilson.
"The competition for females can get very aggressive and although you can only speculate, it may be that this stag was ostracised and got disoriented and lost."
However, the Ulster Wildlife Trust's nature reserve manager, Andy Crory, said any number of factors could cause deer to wander onto roads or urban areas.
"They're sensitive creatures, so it could have been spooked by anything - a car, a dog, a person," said Mr Crory.
"In most forest parks, you'll find people walking dogs and unfortunately they often let them off leads, which unnerves the deer. When they're afraid, they can easily walk onto roads.
"Throughout the winter, you'll find them on roads more often as it's darker and they tend to come out at night, when they're more likely to avoid people.
"They don't like to be seen, so they hide, and if they get onto a road, they panic."
This stag was filmed wandering along a country road in County Down last weekend - Saintfield woman Anita Black provided the footage.
The USPCA advice, for those who come across deer outside their natural habitat, is to call the police and not to approach the animals.
Private herds are maintained at Colebrooke Estate in County Fermanagh; Baronscourt Estate in County Tyrone; Shanes Castle Estate in County Antrim and the Clandeboye Estate in County Down.
But for enthusiasts who wants to spot them in the wild, Tollymore Forest Park is a good place to start.
Although the exact number is unknown, the deer population in the County Down beauty spot is believed to be about 150.
Fallow - which are native to Europe - have been in the area since the 1970s.
It is one of three deer species that inhabit Northern Ireland, the others being Red and Japanese Sika.
Wild deer generally originate from the deer parks of large estates both past and present. Sika are generally confined to counties Fermanagh and Tyrone.
The National Trust maintains a small enclosed herd of Fallow deer at Crom Castle in County Fermanagh, while Sika can be spotted in Gortin Glen Forest, County Tyrone, and Red deer roam Gosford Forest Park in County Armagh.
The Forest Service carries out deer culls each year to keep the population from becoming too large.
"Woodlands need to regenerate and if the deer population got out of control, the woodland that provides for them and other animals would be destroyed," said Mr Crory.
He added that wildlife enthusiasts should look for signs of deer if they want to spot them.
"Look for deer tracks or signs that they've been rubbing up against trees, and you need to be still - their senses are better than ours so if you're spotted first, they'll be gone."
