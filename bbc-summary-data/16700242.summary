What is Holocaust Memorial Day?

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Millions of Jews and others killed during the Holocaust are being remembered in services across the UK, as part of Holocaust Memorial Day.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
In the UK, Holocaust Memorial Day takes place on 27 January.
It marks the anniversary of the liberation of the Auschwitz concentration camp by soldiers of the Soviet Army in 1945.
The day is a national mark of respect for all victims of the Holocaust as well as victims of other genocide around the world.
It helps to educate people about the terrible events and it shows how important it is to be tolerant of other people and their beliefs.
Marking the day also makes sure the Holocaust is not forgotten and can help to stop anything like it ever happening again.
