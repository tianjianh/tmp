[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
L/Cpl Scott Hetherington, 22, from Middleton, Greater Manchester, died at Camp Taji, north of Baghdad, on 2 January.
He served as a vehicle commander with the 2nd Battalion, Duke of Lancaster's Regiment.
L/Cpl Hetherington is the first UK soldier to die in Iraq in almost eight years.
The 22-year-old, who was nicknamed "Snowball", had only been in Iraq for a month when he died and had only recently become a father to a daughter.
Friends hailed him as a "true hero" and a "brave lion" on Facebook.
The soldier's commanding officer Lt Col Rob Singleton said:  "L/Cpl Scott Hetherington was a superb soldier and a first-class leader."
"Utterly professional and talented, he was full of character, fun and his enthusiasm was infectious."
L/Cpl Hetherington was a member of Blenheim Company and was a vehicle commander in the Force Protection Platoon.  His regiment was based at Weeton Barracks near Blackpool.
The British Army is in Iraq as part of the UK's effort to combat so-called Islamic State militants.
About 150 soldiers from the battalion are being deployed to Iraq for six months.
They form part of a 500-strong Army force being sent to train Iraqi and Kurdish security forces.
