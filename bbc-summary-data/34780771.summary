The 25-year-old Samoa international joined Salford on a two-year deal this week after leaving Brisbane Broncos.
Vidot has previously spoken about considering a career in wrestling.
"We'd actually spoke about him and then three weeks later we were told that he was going to be signing for the WWE," Salford head coach Ian Watson told BBC Radio Manchester.
Salford's director of rugby, Tim Sheens, then looked into it further to see if Vidot was definitely going to be joining the world's biggest wrestling company.
"Tim said he was going to do a little bit more digging and find out how true everything was with that," Watson added.
"Tim's gone back there and said he's hoping to be looking at a contract so that's when we moved forward with our plans."
With Watson and Sheens planning for next season there could be more arrivals at the AJ Bell Stadium ahead of the new season.
"There's a couple at the moment that we're speaking to and in negotiations with but we'll have to see whether they come off," added Watson.
"At the moment we're building a good, solid squad here with people who are going to be competitive and work hard for each other."
