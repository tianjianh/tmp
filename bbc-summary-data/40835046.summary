[SN]TITLE[SN]
Port Vale 2-3 Wycombe Wanderers

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Adebayo Akinfenwa helped fire Wycombe to their first League Two win of the season as they beat Port Vale at Vale Park.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
First-half strikes from Akinfenwa and Paris Cowan-Hall put Vale on the back foot in their first league game at home since being relegated from League One last season.
Gareth Ainsworth's men made the best possible start when Akinfenwa nodded in a Joe Jacobson free-kick with just two minutes on the clock.
The Chairboys doubled their lead 10 minutes later when Cowan-Hall cut in from the left side of the box and curled an effort past Valiants keeper Sam Hornby.
Wycombe made it three when a Luke O'Nien volley at goal was met by the head of Akinfenwa, who doubled his tally for the day.
Vale got a goal back in the 88th minute when substitute Dan Turner headed in a Lawrie Wilson cross.
Two minutes later fellow substitute Ben Whitfield made it a nervy finish for the visitors, smashing a shot into the top left corner, but it proved in vain.
