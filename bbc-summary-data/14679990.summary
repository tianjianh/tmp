[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Michael Rogers, 31, suffered "life changing injuries" and was left hospitalised by Logan Usher, 21.
Usher was jailed following a trial at Oxford Crown Court in May after he denied grievous bodily harm.
The police and Crown Prosecution Service are now deciding whether he should face more serious charges.
The assault took place at The Red Lion in Kidlington, Oxfordshire, in June 2010.
A Thames Valley Police statement said: "Mr Rogers suffered life-changing injuries as a result of the assault and has been hospitalised ever since.
"As a result of recent complications, Mr Rogers' condition deteriorated and he was sadly pronounced dead after life support systems were switched off."
According to police, Mr Rogers died in Nottingham at his mother's house.
