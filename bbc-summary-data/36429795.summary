[SN]TITLE[SN]
Newly-extended First Minister's Questions to take place at Holyrood

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Nicola Sturgeon is due to take part in the first newly extended First Minister's Questions at the Scottish Parliament.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Last week MSPs voted to extend the Thursday Q&A from 30 to 45 minutes.
Ms Sturgeon had called for a longer session, as well as more chances for committees to quiz her, following her election as first minister.
The longer sessions will be tried out for the next two Thursdays and then evaluated by the parliament.
