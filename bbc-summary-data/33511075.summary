Also joining the Scottish Premiership club is former Banik Most midfielder Gramoz Kurtaj, while 19-year-old striker Carlton Morris arrives on loan from Norwich City.
Accies have sent midfielder Nico Sumsky on loan to Airdrieonians until January.
Nade, 30, returns to the top flight after two seasons in the Championship.
The Frenchman scored seven goals in 33 games for Rovers last season.
Having started his career with Troyes, he first arrived in Scotland to join Hearts in 2007 after leaving Sheffield United and spent the first six months of 2014 with Dundee following spells with Alki Larnaca in Cyprus and Samut Songkhram and PTT Rayong in Thailand.
Nade said on Twitter: "Thanks to Hamilton to gave me the opportunity to be back to the top league. I will work work to stay in that league."
Kurakins, who has three international caps, has spent the last four years with Ventspils, helping them win the Latvian title in the last two seasons.
Prior to that, the 25-year-old was at Celtic for three years, having signed from Blazma Rezekne, but failed to make a first-team appearance and had loan spells with Brechin City and Stranraer.
He has been an ever-present in 11 games for Ventspils this season, with the reigning champions lying second in the table behind Liepaja but with a game in hand.
Kurtaj, a 24-year-old Yugoslav-born German, spent last season with Banik as they finished 12th in the Czech Republic's second tier.
He started his career with Hertha Berlin's second team before spells with Neustrelitz and Carl Zeiss Jena in the German regional leagues.
Morris, who has made one senior appearance for Norwich as a substitute, had loan spells last season with Oxford United and York City in England's League Two, scoring once in 19 appearances.
He is the first young Canaries player to move to New Douglas Park since manager Alex Neil promised to send some of his emerging youths to Accies after his own switch to Norwich last season.
Morris, who subsequently signed a new two-year deal with Norwich, said on Twitter: "Can't wait to get started with my opportunity in the SPL with Accies."
Hamilton had previously also signed midfielder Chris Turner from Dumbarton and former Clyde goalkeeper Alan Martin, while Brazilian defender Lucas agreed a new contract after a short-term deal last season.
Meanwhile, 21-year-old Czech midfielder Sumsky heads out on loan to Airdrieonians having failed to break into the Accies side since arriving from Slovakian club Dukla Banska Bystrica in January.
