The Keelman's Way, close to Ryton Golf Club, has been closed off, after what is thought to be coal waste from an old colliery caught fire.
Council officials fear some sections of the path could collapse.
Tyne and Wear Fire Brigade believe the blaze may have started in November and could continue burning for several months or even years.
