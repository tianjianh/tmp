It comes as Prime Minister David Cameron prepares to outline UK government plans to accept more families fleeing Syria.
Local authorities in Wales have said they are willing to "play their part" but asked for help to meet the costs.
The Welsh government has said the UK government should pay as the matter is not devolved.
Representatives from charities and local government are expected to be invited to the summit, at a date and location to be confirmed.
Public Services Minister Leighton Andrews and Communities Minister Lesley Griffiths will also attend.
A spokeswoman for the Welsh government said: "The First Minister believes the Welsh government has an important co-ordination role in how Wales responds to the refugee crisis.
"We want to bring key agencies and service providers together in one room, so everyone can have a clear idea of the challenges and responsibilities we are facing, and so we can jointly develop the most effective and collective response.
"We have said that Wales stands ready to play our part in responding to the crisis, and that will be the starting point for discussion."
