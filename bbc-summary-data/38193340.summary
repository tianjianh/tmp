Stephen Dobbie put the visitors on front before Myles Hippolyte equalised for Falkirk on the stroke of half-time.
The Falkirk winger scored his second of the game before Derek Lyle headed home an equaliser for the Dumfries side.
It brings and end to a run of seven straight defeats for Queens as the Bairns are now five matches unbeaten
After a fairly dismal opening 30 minutes the game burst into action.
Queens top scorer Dobbie was allowed to stride forward towards the home goal. The striker played a one-two with Derek Lyle before clipping the ball into the net from 16-yards out, his 15th goal of the campaign.
Falkirk drew level when James Craigan was bundled to the ground on the edge of the 18-yard box and Hippolyte curled a free-kick around the wall into the bottom corner of the net.
The home side took the lead after a sustained spell of pressure, however there was a fair slice of fortune that came with the goal.
Hippolyte made space on the left hand touchline and sent a deep cross into the box. The ball drifted over the heads of both strikers and defenders and with Queens keeper Lee Robinson rooted to the spot the ball crept into the bottom corner of the net.
However, the visitors would not be denied and Darren Brownlee strode down the right hand side and sent a cross into the box that was met by Derek Lyle, who nodded the ball home from just six yards out.
Falkirk manager Peter Houston: "Maybe we should be grateful for a point given the way we played today. If that is our standard we will be no where near the play-offs.
"In the past two games we have taken four out of six points but quite frankly we have been lucky to get them. Days off will be cancelled. I am not happy tonight. I am going to a Christmas night out tonight - I am as well cancelling it.
"Our standards have dropped since last season. Our consistency levels are no where near as good as they were last season. If other teams are showing more desire and more commitment to win football, matches than us I have to question myself. I am the manager and I will need to change it."
Queen of the South manager Gary Naismith: "The biggest thing today was to try and stop the rot. It can be soul destroying as a player when you are on that type of run. The players today were different class.
"I thought Falkirk had more possession but we were the better team. Our next step is to get the win.
"We wanted to stop the rot now we need to get a win and that today will have given the players a bit of confidence."
