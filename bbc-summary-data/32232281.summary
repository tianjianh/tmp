England full-back Sam Tomkins says he will sign for a Super League club "in the next few days" after confirming he will leave New Zealand Warriors.

Wigan, the 26-year-old's former club, have first refusal to sign him.
Tomkins says he has not agreed a deal with any side, but has confirmed he will not be switching codes to union.
"I'm definitely going to be in Super League, I can say that. I can't say exactly where because I've not put pen to paper," he told BBC Radio 5 live.

Tomkins had previously hinted he would be keen try rugby union at some point in his career.
He played a game in the 15-man code for the Barbarians against Australia in 2013, while his older brother Joel spent three years at Premiership side Saracens before returning to Wigan last season.
But Tomkins, who cited homesickness as his main reason for wanting to return to England, will remain in rugby league and Wigan are strong favourites to sign him.
"Everyone's going to think that's going to happen, aren't they?" added Tomkins when asked about a move back to the Warriors. "That was predictable that everyone would assume that.
"It's one of those where I can't say anything until I do sign somewhere and it will all be out of the way.
"Once it gets released it will be a lot easier for me wherever I am," continued Tomkins. "I don't think the announcement will take too long and hopefully it will be out of the way, not only for me but for people asking questions."
Before his move to the National Rugby League at the end of 2013, Tomkins scored 144 tries in 152 appearances for Wigan after coming through their youth system and was voted Super League's Man of Steel in 2012.
If he returns to Wigan, he will part of a squad that also includes two of his brothers - forward Joel, 28, and hooker Logan, 22.
Meanwhile, Salford owner Marwan Koukash has said he would back any move for Tomkins if Red Devils head coach Iestyn Harris wanted to sign him.
Salford failed with a bid for the England back, who can also play stand-off.
Writing in his column in the Manchester Evening News, Koukash said: "I am pleased it looks as if Sam Tomkins is coming back to Super League and if Iestyn wants him, then we will go for him.
"It is down to the coach, we will back him to the hilt."
