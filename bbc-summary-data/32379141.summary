Ambulance bosses brought in the doctor, usually on call for major disasters, at Worcestershire Royal Hospital.
Now, the NHS Trust Development Authority had said it will appoint an improvement director at the hospital.
It confirmed that despite pressures, staff had "high levels of commitment to patient safety".  The trust itself has not commented on the move.
The doctor, known as a medical incident officer, cared for eight patients at the hospital, on 10 April.
West Midlands Ambulance Service, which decided to call in the doctor, said the decision was "unprecedented" and "not taken lightly".
Last week, the hospitals trust said a peak over the previous two weekends was caused by a 15% increase in blue light ambulance calls, a figure disputed by the ambulance service.
The development authority said the hospitals trust was "facing considerable challenges" and additional senior clinical support would be provided.
It added the support staff being brought in would work with the hospitals trust "on immediate and sustainable changes to overcome the current challenges" it faced.
The authority said it had commissioned reviews into how emergency care could be improved and to investigate allegations around bullying and harassment and these reviews were expected to report shortly.
A spokesperson for the authority said: "Despite significant pressures, staff in the emergency departments and ambulance service are demonstrating very high levels of commitment to maintain patient safety.
"We will support the trust and its staff as they work with local health and social care partners to deliver necessary improvements."
The authority provides support, oversight and governance for NHS trusts.
