What are your memories of the Battle of Britain? Were you involved in the campaign? Or do you know someone who was?
The Battle of Britain was the German air force's attempt to gain air superiority over the RAF.
The battle lasted throughout the summer of 1940. It was the first major battle in history fought entirely in the air and was the first significant strategic defeat for the Nazis during World War Two.
Their ultimate failure was one of the turning points of the Second World War and prevented Germany from invading Britain.
To mark the 75th anniversary of the Battle of Britain we would like to hear stories and memories from the time. If you are happy to share your family stories please get in touch.
