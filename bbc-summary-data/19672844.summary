Roger Davies, who farms near Llanwrtyd Wells, discovered two dead ewes on 10 September.
A further three dead ewes have also been found on the farm, which he believes have also been targeted.
Meanwhile, two sheep were found seriously injured on Wednesday although one is expected to recover. Dyfed-Powys Police have been informed.
Mr Davies said a neighbour saw two men wearing camouflage clothing, armed with a crossbow, in a Forestry Commission picnic site on the weekend of the 8 and 9 September.
The pair had a dark coloured tent but there was no sign of a vehicle, he added.
One of the dead sheep found on 10 September had been hit by a crossbow bolt in the stomach, the other had been struck in the head.
Mr Davies, who farms at Traws Nant on the banks of Llyn Brianne, believes they were killed over the weekend of 8 and 9 September.
One of the sheep found injured on Wednesday is expected to recover after treatment, but the second is expected to be put down.
Mr Davies is concerned that whoever has carried out the crossbow shootings is either still in the area or has returned more than once. He has urged people to be vigilant and to look for signs of suspicious activity.
"It's devastating in as much as it's totally unnecessary," he said.
"It's not even though they're doing it for food, which is illegal but at least I could understand it."
He said it appeared they were being targeted "for sick reasons".
Inspector Andy Reed of Dyfed-Powys Police said the force has received a report from a concerned farmer.
"Appropriate advice has been given and I would ask anyone who has seen anything suspicious in the area that they think we should know about to please contact us on 101," he said.
