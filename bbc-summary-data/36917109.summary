Ginnelly, who joined the Clarets from Shrewsbury Town in August 2015, started in the academy system at Aston Villa.
Coventry-born Ginnelly, who made the first of three league appearances for Shrewsbury in August 2014, scored five times in 20 games on loan at National League side Altrincham last season.
The 19-year-old becomes the League One club's 10th signing of the summer.
Ginnelly is the third new loan recruit from a Premier League club, following Southampton defender Jason McCarthy and West Ham United midfielder George Dobson.
Simeon Jackson, Franck Moussa, Joe Edwards, Kacy Milan Butterfield, Erhun Oztumer, Florent Cuvelier and Theo Vassell have all signed on a more permanent basis.
"This is a great move for me," said Ginnelly, who is yet to make his Burnley debut. I'm a young player who is still learning but I back myself to do well.
"I was in the National League last year and I couldn't have asked for a better loan. I learned a lot from it. Now I've come to a club who were going for promotion in League One."
