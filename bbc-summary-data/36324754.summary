The 23-year-old, who had only recently joined Whitehaven RLFC, tested positive for nandrolone in an out-of-competition test on 27 November 2015.
Former Elbra amateur prop Todd admitted to the anti-doping rule violation.
His ban is backdated from 18 December 2015 to 17 December 2019.
"This case continues to highlight the worrying and growing trend of steroid use amongst young men," UKAD director of legal Graham Arthur said.
"UKAD works alongside the Rugby Football League (RFL) to provide players with vital anti-doping education and resources to ensure that they are aware of the risks that steroid use poses to both their health and their sporting careers."
