Director of rugby Dean Richards says he does not feel any pressure, despite Newcastle Falcons failing to win any of their opening three Premiership games.

Falcons have also conceded an average of 40 points per game, including last weekend's 41-3 defeat by Exeter Chiefs.
Inferior points' difference leaves Newcastle bottom, below London Irish who are also yet to record a victory.
"I don't feel it at all, I just don't like losing and neither do the players," Richards told BBC Newcastle.
"You boys [the media] probably like to put pressure on, in a Jose Mourinho situation you boys thrive on it."
Newly-promoted Worcester are next up for Richards' side, having already picked up their first win of the campaign in a shock home victory against Northampton.
The former Leicester and Harlequins boss says the Warriors are a "good side" but says the answers to addressing their form lie in their own preparation.
"We've got too good a squad to languish," he added.
"We have to look at our own performances, it's understanding how we want to play and making it happen.
"We haven't won yet but we will do, we're three games into a 22-match season."
