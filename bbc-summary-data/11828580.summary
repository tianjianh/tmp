Edinburgh to trial 'pee pod' street urinals

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Portable urinals are set to be trialled in Edinburgh in a bid to cut down on late-night revellers urinating in the street.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The open air plastic structures would be set up in the city centre over Friday and Saturday nights before being removed the next day.
Edinburgh City Council said the Grassmarket was a particular 'hot spot' for people urinating in the street.
It would cost about Â£9,000 to buy the temporary urinals.
There would be further ongoing costs for servicing, installation and removal.
They may also be trialled at taxi ranks, where there is usually a marshal.
An Edinburgh City Council spokeswoman, said: "Urinating in the street accounts for a third of all fixed penalty notices for anti-social behaviour and a large amount of residents' complaints.
"We are keen to address this issue with temporary urinals at some of the 'hotspots' around the city."
