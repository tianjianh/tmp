That was slightly lower than 2014 and turnover was also down from £24m to £22m, however, margins improved.
A note in the accounts said the profitable performance came despite "difficult ongoing market conditions".
The company has 50 stores across the UK and Ireland, as well as a significant online business.
The accounts show it employed 320 people in 2015, paying total salaries of £4m.
In 2016, the company plans to open further stores in Scotland, England and the Isle of Man which should see staff numbers rise to more than 500.
Argento was founded by Pete Boyle from Strabane, County Tyrone, who started the business from a stall on Royal Avenue in the 1990s.
It is still controlled by Mr Boyle and his wife -  the accounts show that they received a £4m dividend in 2015.
