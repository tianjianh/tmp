[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Prince of Wales opened the new head office of risk management firm Alcumus in Cardiff.
And he met community members at St Michael's Church in Llandovery.
He made a donation to help save White Park Cattle from extinction during a visit to a herd at Llandeilo, Carmarthenshire.
During his visit to Dinefwr Park in Llandeilo, the prince pledged support to the National Trust's Save the Herd campaign to help its effort to safeguard the White Park Cattle which have grazed the area for more than 1,000 years.
About 750 White Park breeding females exist in the world, said the trust, which aims to raise Â£36,000 to buy a new bull and cows.
Prince Charles also learned about the work of climate change charity the Size of Wales in Cwmbran, Torfaen, and he met with pupils taking part in its education programme at Blenheim Road Community Primary.
The charity runs programmes to demonstrate the importance of rainforests and encourages young people to take action against climate change.
The Duchess of Cambridge visited Torfaen and Caerphilly on Wednesday in her new role as royal patron of children's charities.
