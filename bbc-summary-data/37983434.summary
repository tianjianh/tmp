[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Elliott Whitehouse scored on his first start for Lincoln as they beat York to extend the Minstermen's winless run in the National League.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The visitors opened the scoring when Whitehouse turned the ball past York shot-stopper Scott Flinders at the near post.
Nathan Arnold's 20-yard free-kick five minutes later saw Lincoln take a 2-0 lead into the break.
York came close to pulling a goal back when Sean Newton hit the bar, before the visitors extended their advantage three minutes later when Luke Waterfall fired in from close range.
The home side got one goal back when Yan Klukowski found the net after his initial effort had been saved by Paul Farman - but Lincoln restored their three-goal lead five minutes later thanks to Bradley Wood.
York were reduced to 10 men in added time when substitute Daniel Nti was dismissed.
