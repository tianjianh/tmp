They will play at Rotherham United's New York Stadium on 8 April (19:55 BST), the Football Association said.
England have won their two qualifiers so far, thrashing Estonia 8-0 before a 1-0 win against Bosnia-Herzegovina.
"Belgium will be one of our toughest games in this campaign," England captain Steph Houghton said.
"Hopefully we'll get a good win and take another step towards qualification."
Mark Sampson's side, who finished third at the 2015 World Cup, are currently third in Group Seven.
Eight group winners and the six best runners-up advance to the final tournament alongside hosts the Netherlands. The other two runners-up will contest a play-off for the final spot.
