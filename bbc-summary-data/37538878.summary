Smyth struck in the 12th minute, but Artem Besedin scored the equaliser for the hosts three minutes later in Kiev.
Michael Duffy and Smyth were denied by Dmytro Bezruk in the second half, while Mark Sykes' 25-yard shot from 25 yards was just wide of the top corner.
Northern Ireland, who have two points from their nine games, finish their campaign at home to France on Tuesday.
Ukraine lie fourth in Group Three on 11 points, while Northern Ireland are certain to finish bottom.
Jim Magilton's side went into the match having lost seven of their last eight qualifiers, their only previous point coming in their second fixture in Iceland.
Smyth scored after a counter-attack against the run of play, while Besedin turned home after being set up by Oleksandr Zubkov.
Zubkov failed to find the net with a stoppage time free-kick.
