Woking 3-3 Eastleigh

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Woking came from behind twice to grab a share of the spoils from a six-goal thriller against Eastleigh at Kingfield Stadium.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The in-form away side took the lead early on, as midfielder Luke Coulson netted his fourth goal from the last three games from close range after finding himself in plenty of space in the box.
Debutant Matthew Tubbs flicked in an equaliser for the Cards midway though the first half but goals from Adam Dugdale and Joe Partington put the visitors back in control at the break.
Partington turned from hero to villain on the hour mark as he felled Anthony Edgar inside the Eastleigh half and Delano Sam-Yorke poked home the resulting free-kick to reduce the deficit before second-half substitute Luke Chike Kandi fired in an equaliser to make it 3-3 for Garry Hill's hosts with 10 minutes remaining.
