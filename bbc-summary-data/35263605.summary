A shop in a small village in Berkshire was ram raided by a vehicle.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Budgens in Victoria Road, Mortimer, was damaged in the raid.
Owner Charlie Hills said a 4x4 reversed in to the front of the shop. Nothing of value was stolen due to the security system in place.
He said: "There is a lot of mess but we are clearing up. It's a lot of damage and a lot of trouble for nothing effectively."
Thames Valley Police confirmed the shop was raided between 03:30 and 04:00 GMT.
Mr Hills said: "The community have been fantastic. We have had lots of support."
