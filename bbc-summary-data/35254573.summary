Hatton Garden raid: Accused 'were trusted by ringleaders'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Four men accused of being part of the Hatton Garden raid were trusted to be involved because of their "connections to the ringleaders", a court has heard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
In his closing speech, prosecutor Philip Evans told Woolwich Crown Court the men had given "lies" and "half truths" as evidence during the trial.
Carl Wood, William Lincoln, Jon Harbinson and Hugh Doyle all deny being part in the Â£14m theft.
Four other men have already pleaded guilty to taking part in the raid.
Summing up the case against the accused men, Mr Evans said the robbery had involved a "staggering sum of money" and had been a carefully planned operation by men who knew what they were doing.
He asked the jury to consider whether the "ringleaders" - who had already pleaded guilty - would have trusted those on trial to look after their jewel-laden bags and not take a "peek" inside.
"The men who have pleaded guilty were a group who thrived on acquisitive crime - taking people's money and possessions, greed in reality.
"What they needed were people who wouldn't question that," he said.
Referring to Mr Lincoln's claim that he did not know what was in the bags he helped move, he asked the jury whether they could "believe that for one second?"
"They were never going to let that significant commodity go into the hands of someone they did not trust," he said.
Mr Evans insisted the four men had not told the truth to the court.
"On each of the four occasions that you have heard the defendants give evidence, each of them have told you lies," Mr Evans said.
He added that it did not matter what size role each of the men had played because "if you take part knowingly, you're guilty".
The case continues.
Daniel Jones, 60, of Park Avenue, Enfield; John Collins, 75, of Bletsoe Walk, Islington; Terry Perkins, 67, of Heene Road, Enfield, and Brian Reader, 76, of Dartford Road, Dartford, have all previously pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit burglary.
