Shred 3 was made by Cut Media over the last two winters.
Ski-Scotland, which promotes snowsports tourism, hopes the short film will draw more visitors to ski centres such as The Lecht, Glenshee and Nevis Range.
Since being uploaded to YouTube in October last year, The Ridge, which was shot on Skye, has been viewed more than 39 million times.
Heather Negus, of Ski-Scotland, said: "We have been stunned by how well the impressive aerial footage of dramatic snow-covered landscapes captures just how immense and challenging Scotland's snowsports areas can be.
"It also shows what a great place this is for kids and adults learning to ski or trying their first tricks and jumps.
"Our aim is to inspire skiers and snowboarders to head for Scotland's slopes rather than overseas, perhaps for the first time, and to show what a great, fun activity they have right on their doorstep."
Macaskill returned to his home turf of the Isle of Skye to make The Ridge.
The Scot took a bike on to the Cuillin Ridge, including to the top of the challenging rock formation known as the Inaccessible Pinnacle.
