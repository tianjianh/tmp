Elizabeth Bowe, 50, was found badly injured in Bobby Jones Place in St Andrews at about 21:00 on Saturday 17 September.
She was taken to Ninewells Hospital in Dundee but she died three days later.
Her brother Charles Gordon, 51, appeared at Dundee Sheriff Court on Tuesday facing a single charge of murder.
He made no plea or declaration and was remanded in custody.
The police were called out to Ms Bowe's home before the incident.
The Police Investigations and Review Commissioner's (PIRC) investigation was ordered by the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service (COPFS).
A spokesman for the PIRC said: "The investigation will focus on the initial police response leading up to the incident.
"A report on the Commissioner's findings will be submitted to the COPFS in due course."
