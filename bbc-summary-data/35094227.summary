[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A total of 51 refugees will arrive in Belfast from Lebanon, under the Vulnerable Persons Relocations Scheme.
Eleven of them are children under the age of five, including a baby.
Cards and drawings by local children to greet the refugees are on display at a special welcome centre where they will spend their first few days.
After the initiation process, the families will move into housing in the private rental sector until alternative arrangements are made.
This is the first time Northern Ireland has participated in a refugee resettlement program.
The first group will be settled in the Belfast area.
The second group of refugees will arrive in the first quarter of 2016 and will be settled in the north west.
Prime Minister David Cameron announced the expansion of the Vulnerable Persons Relocation Scheme on 7 September.
The scheme will resettle up to 20,000 Syrian refugees across the UK over the next five years.
Refugees from countries neighbouring Syria will also be resettled under the scheme, mostly Turkey, Jordan and Lebanon.
It does not extend to those who seek asylum in Europe or countries like Libya.
