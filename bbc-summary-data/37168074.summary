Essex Police said the pair, both aged 13, had walked from The Stow in Harlow and got into difficulty after going through marshland off Eastwick Road, Gilston, at 15:45 BST on Monday.
They called police and were found by the force helicopter before members of the public tried to pull them out.
Officers eventually used a broom handle and shovel to dig the girls out.

"The girls had stepped off the main canal path and down a grass bank onto what they thought was a bridleway," said Pc Tom Lennon, one of those who was called to help.
"Unfortunately they stepped into a peaty bog and one of the girls tripped, causing her to fall into the mud up to her waist.
"It was fortunate they had a mobile phone to dial 999 as they were not sure of their location and were found in a secluded spot."
Police warned walkers of the importance of staying on established footpaths when exploring marshy or coastal areas.
