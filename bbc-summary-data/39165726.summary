Emergency services were called to the four-storey block in Brougham Place at about 06:50 on Saturday.
The fire service said a blaze in the stairwell had caused "heavy smoke logging" and trapped people in upper-level flats.
They were rescued from second and third-floor properties using a turntable ladder and given oxygen.
The six were then treated by paramedics who took them to hospital for further treatment.
