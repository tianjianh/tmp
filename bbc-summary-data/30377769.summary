Girl Online, Zoella's debut novel, was written with "help" from her publisher, the YouTuber has admitted.

In a post shared on Twitter, she said: "Of course I was going to have help from Penguin's editorial team in telling my story.
"The story and characters of Girl Online are all mine."
Another author, Siobhan Curham, who is thanked in the book's acknowledgements, has been responding to Twitter comments about the Girl Online revelations.
It has not been suggested by either the publisher, or Ms Curham herself, that she wrote the book - but Ms Curham has thanked followers for their concern.
One such exchange included a reference to "this writer's books" having Zoella's name on the cover.
Neither Penguin, nor Ms Curham, have responded to Newsbeat's request for a comment.
Many of Zoella's fans sent positive messages to the YouTube star after her announcement, saying that they still "loved" the book.
More than 78,000 copies of Girl Online were sold in its first week of publication.
After the figures were released, Zoella, whose real name is Zoe Sugg, tweeted: "I'm legit blown away by this. I never in a million years thought that so many of you would pick up a copy of Girl Online. Almost want to cry."
The record is the highest since Nielsen BookScan began collecting information on the book market in 1998, according to The Bookseller.
It is the first of a two-book deal Zoella has with Penguin.
