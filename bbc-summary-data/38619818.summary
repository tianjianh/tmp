[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Adebayo Akinfenwa scored late on to rescue a point for Wycombe Wanderers against fellow promotion-hopefuls Luton Town.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Hatters would have leapfrogged their opponents in the League Two table with victory, but their poor discipline came back to haunt them, with Johnny Mullins' sending-off their eighth of the campaign.
Luton came within inches of taking the lead when Danny Hylton played in strike partner Jack Marriott but his rising shot clipped the top of the crossbar on its way over.
The deadlock was broken by the visitors in the 56th minute when skipper Scott Cuthbert attacked Jake Gray's corner at the near post and goalkeeper Jamal Blackman could not keep out his header.
The Hatters then had Mullins sent off for a wild lunge on Wycombe substitute Scott Kashket with 15 minutes left and the visitors could not hold on.
The Chairboys played to a big strength in the 82nd minute as striker Akinfenwa rose at the back post from Joe Jacobson's deep cross to thump a brilliant header past Christian Walton.
