Plans to build a major floating wind farm off the Aberdeenshire coast have taken a step forward, it has been announced.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Crown Estate, which manages the seabed, has granted a lease to the Norwegian firm Statoil which allows the construction of the Hywind project - 15 miles off Peterhead - to begin.
The first power is expected to be generated towards the end of 2017.
Marine Scotland granted consent for the five 6MW turbines last year.
WWF Scotland director Lang Banks said: "Successfully developing floating turbines could enable Scotland to secure even more clean energy from offshore wind in the future."
