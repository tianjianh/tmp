Three games were held at Newcastle United's St James' Park and a dedicated Fanzone was created at Science Central.
NewcastleGateshead Initiative said hosting the event had brought a windfall to the city and hotel occupancy reached 99% on match days.
Chief executive Sarah Stewart said the "memorable event" had been a "huge success" for the region.
Ms Stewart said: "I think it's fair to say Rugby World Cup 2015 in Newcastle has been a huge success. From the games themselves to the atmosphere inside the Fanzone, we've had a remarkable two weekends.
"We've welcomed thousands of international visitors who have all contributed to the estimated £43m of economic impact hosting the tournament has brought to Newcastle.
"I have no doubt we'll be feeling the positive effects Rugby World Cup 2015 for many years to come."
The third and final game at the stadium was held on Saturday with Scotland beating Samoa 36-33.
Northumbria Police said there had been "exceptional behaviour" from all those who attended, with very few low-level arrests throughout the event.
Ch Supt Steve Neill said: "I can't thank the fans, visitors and local people enough for their excellent behaviour and patience.
"I am exceptionally proud to have been a part of it myself.
"This is not something that happens on our doorstep every day but everyone in the region has welcomed this opportunity and reaffirmed that the North East is one of the friendliest, most vibrant and safest places to be."
