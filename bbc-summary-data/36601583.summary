[SN]TITLE[SN]
Construction workers win 2.5% pay increase

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Unions have struck a pay deal that will see 400,000 construction workers receive a pay rise of 2.5% this year.

The two-year pay deal, which is well above inflation, will rise to 2.75% next year.
The UK's inflation rate stood at 0.3% in May, as measured by the Consumer Prices Index.
However, the unions said the deal, which covers the largest number of workers in the industry, is increasingly "unfit for purpose".
Unions GMB, Ucatt and Unite reached the Construction Industry Joint Council (CIJC) agreement, which kicks in on 25 July, with a range of builder federations.
Brian Rye, acting general secretary of Ucatt, said: "This deal ensures that workers will enjoy above inflation increase for the next two years.
"However, employers need to understand that the CIJC agreement does not meet the needs of the workforce and unless it is radically reformed it will soon cease to be relevant to the industry."
The London Living Wage, rates of pay and the impact on supply chains are issues that still need to be resolved, the unions said.
GMB rejected a deal in March that would have spread a 3.5% pay increase over two years.
