[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Singapore Airlines is investigating a recent incident when one of its planes lost power in both engines mid-flight.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Flight SQ836 was flying from Singapore to Shanghai on Saturday night when the plane hit bad weather.
The engines of the Airbus A330-300 cut out, but pilots managed to restore the engines' operations, and landed the aeroplane safely at its destination.
It was carrying 194 people at that time. A subsequent inspection found no engine anomalies, the airline said.
Engine manufacturer Rolls-Royce and Airbus are now working with Singapore Airlines in its investigation.
Power loss in both engines is considered rare in the aviation industry, but pilots are trained to respond to it.
