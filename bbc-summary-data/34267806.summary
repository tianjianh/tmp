President Rafael Correa said he had contacted the Venezuelan authorities for help extinguishing 17 major fires across the country and that they had promised to send helicopters.
He said he would also ask Brazil, Colombia and Peru for support.
Ten people have been arrested on suspicion of setting fires in the vicinity of the capital.
The government has asked people to denounce firebugs and has offered a $50,000 (Â£32,500) reward for information leading to their capture.
One of the biggest fires is burning in the hills of Auqui, north-east of Quito.
Dozens of firefighters are trying to stop the flames from spreading to residential areas.
Three firefighters were killed last week and many more injured.
