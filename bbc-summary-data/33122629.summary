Officers said they were aware of an event at Runnymede Eco-Village, in Egham, and were "committed to ensuring the safety of the public".
In a statement, the force said it was taking action to halt proceedings "to prevent any disturbance, disruption or distress to the local community".
It added there was a concern about "increased crime and threat to safety".
"The force will not tolerate unregulated, unlicensed events... officers will direct people preparing, gathering or waiting for the rave to leave the land.
"In addition the act gives police powers to seize property in relation to an event," it said.
The Eco-Village is close to the site of the sealing of Magna Carta where celebrations are taking place this weekend to mark its 800th anniversary.
