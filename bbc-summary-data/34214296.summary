Claire Duck, 31, captains the British team, which consists of senior women, junior men and junior women's teams.
"I'm really honoured to have been asked to be team captain," she said. "To represent your country at a global championships is hugely exciting, so to add a team captaincy role to that is unbelievable.
"I think there is a lot to be excited about; the juniors on the team have shown a lot of promise on the domestic and European stage, and the senior women accompanying myself have all worked extremely hard to achieve this opportunity."
She is joined in the team for the senior women's race (12:55 BST) by Emily Hosker-Thornhill, Rebecca Murray and Louise Small.
