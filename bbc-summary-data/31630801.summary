Madonna fell down some steps on stage during a live performance at the Brit Awards.

She tumbled backwards over her cape as she sang Living For Love, her new single.
Video and still pictures show the 56-year-old momentarily on her back before she recovers to finish the song.
She hit the ground "with a loud thwacking noise" and the room "fell silent" according to Newsbeat reporters who were just metres away.
As the singer got up again, she got tangled in her cloak and "looked furious".
It's the talk of Twitter with "Madonna" and the hashtag #shefellover trending top worldwide.
It appears the star lost her balance after a dancer in goat horns tugged at her ruby-lined cape.
Madonna later posted on her Instagram saying "my beautiful cape was tied too tight! But nothing can stop me and love really lifted me up! Thanks for your good wishes! I'm fine!"
There is a clear pause in the song, so at least we all now know she was singing live.
