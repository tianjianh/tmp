Graham Westley: 'Bringing David Pipe back a 'no-brainer'

Newport County boss Graham Westley says bringing David Pipe back to the club was a 'no-brainer.'

Pipe, 33, returns to the club he captained to promotion in 2013 on a loan deal from Eastleigh.
Westley believes the midfielder is just the man to help his side in their League Two relegation battle.
"He's got experience and defensive qualities and leadership qualities, everything we need in the situation we are in right now," said Westley.
Pipe first joined Newport in September 2011 and went on to make more than 100 appearances for the Exiles over three seasons.
He was an integral part of the Newport side that was promoted back to the Football League via the then-Conference play-off final at Wembley in 2013.
But he departed the Welsh club in May 2014 for Forest Green Rovers before joining National League side Eastleigh in May 2016.
With Newport now at the bottom of League Two and currently five points from safety, Westley said Pipe had the attributes his side needed right now.
"Sometimes a player comes along who's got a history with a football club," said Westley.
"A history of success. When you've got a player you know is going to be strong in the dressing room, who understands winning standards and demands them, it's a no-brainer to bring them back."
A former Wales under-21 skipper, Pipe earned a full Wales cap in a 2003 friendly international against the United States.
Having begun his career at Coventry, Pipe had spells at Notts County, Bristol Rovers and Cheltenham.
In June 2010 he was convicted of wounding with intent after hitting a man with a wine bottle. He was sentenced to 38 months in prison.
Westley said what had gone on before had no bearing on his decision to sign Pipe.
"I've had a lot of players, who have been part of very successful sides who have allegedly had their problems in the past," added Westley.
"I judge people on what I see, on what is in front of me. I don't judge people on where they've been or what they've done because that would not be fair.
"David is looking forward with his life and career and very much wants to be a part of Newport County."
