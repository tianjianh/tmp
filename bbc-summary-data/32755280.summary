Plans to mark the Queen's 90th birthday next year will celebrate her "love" of horses and "deep involvement" with the Armed Forces, organisers have said.

Four events will be held inside the grounds of Windsor Castle between May 12 and 15, with members of the Royal Family due to attend each night.
The Queen will herself attend the last event, a theatrical show that will be broadcast live on TV.
The birthday events will feature more than 1,200 participants and 550 horses.
Performers will include singers - including Katherine Jenkins - musicians and dancers as well as actors, actresses and artists.
The event is also expected to celebrate her "dedication to the Commonwealth", with international performers due to come from New Zealand, Fiji, Canada, Oman, South Africa and Chile.
Event producer Simon Brooks-Ward, who was responsible for the Diamond Jubilee Pageant in Windsor, said there would be "a very happy and celebratory feel" to the event.
"We have been delighted with the level of response from funders and participants. It should be a very special and memorable occasion," he added.
Any proceeds from the event will be donated to a number of the Queen's charities, which will be selected by an advisory committee.
