How do ants clean themselves?

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Scientists have discovered that ants clean themselves a unique way.

By using powerful microscopes, scientists from Cambridge University now know how ants keep themselves clean.
They use parts of their body which look a lot like small combs and brushes.
Ants and most other insects all have antennae.
They look like hairy feelers coming out of their head and face.
They rely on their antennae for lots of different tasks: smelling food, finding mates and also, very importantly, communicating with each other.
If the sensitive hairs which cover their antennae get dirty, then the insects find it really hard to find food and reproduce.
Up until now scientists have been uncertain about how exactly ants keep their antennae clean.
Dr Alexander Hackmann and  from the University of Cambridge made the discovery with his colleagues.
They were using microscopes to look at, camponotus rufifemur, ants.
The microscope helps the scientist see really small details on the insect's body which are not visible to the naked eye.
Dr Hackmann says:  "Ants have a special cleaning structure on their front legs that is used to groom their antennae. A notch and spur covered in different types of hairs form a cleaning device, similar in shape to a tiny lobster claw.
"During a cleaning movement, the antenna is pulled through the device which clears away dirt particles using 'bristles', a 'comb' and a 'brush'."
The scientists think that this discovery could actually help the technology industry in a big way.
Contamination can be a big problem for technological devices, especially as the parts which make up the devices and technology we use every day, get smaller and smaller.
This discovery could help scientists and engineers develop new ways to clean those really small parts.
