The 21-year-olds have agreed four-year deals with the Black Cats.
McNair, who represented Northern Ireland at Euro 2016, made his United debut in September 2014 and played 27 times for the club.
Scot Love, who spent time on loan at Wigan last season, played twice for United, the first of which was against the Black Cats in February.
BBC Sport NI understands a number of clubs were interested in McNair, who will link up again with former Red Devils boss David Moyes.
Love, meanwhile, is a Scotland Under-21 international who can play at full-back or in midfield.
"I want to add some young players to the squad as well as some senior players and both of them have got really good potential and the opportunity to improve," said Moyes.
"I want to bring in players who are here for the long term as well as the short and hopefully these two are here for the long term."
Moyes succeeded new England manager Sam Allardyce at Sunderland last month.
He made his first signing last week by bringing in defender Papy Djilobodji from Chelsea for £8m.
Adnan Januzaj, who has also been linked with Sunderland, may join McNair and Love in leaving United, with the Belgian wanting a permanent transfer.
