Talbot started his career at Sheffield Wednesday, and has also had spells with Scunthope, Luton and Plymouth.
"I've worked with Drew before and he's a fantastic signing," Portsmouth assistant manager Leam Richardson told the Portsmouth website.
"He's everything that our fans like about a player - he's robust, works hard and is very fit."
Pompey finished sixth in the League Two table last season, but suffered a 3-2 aggregate defeat by Plymouth Argyle in the play-off semi-finals
