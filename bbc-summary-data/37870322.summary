[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
South Africa fast bowler Dale Steyn is out of the Test series in Australia after fracturing his shoulder on day two of the first Test in Perth.

The 33-year-old, who is second in the ICC Test bowling rankings, pulled up while bowling shortly before lunch.
Steyn will return to South Africa to see a shoulder specialist and it is expected he will have surgery.
South Africa closed day two at the Waca on 104-2 in their second innings, leading by 102.
Proteas team manager Dr Mohammed Moosajee said: "An injury of this nature is rare and will in all likelihood require surgery but that will only be confirmed once we receive an opinion from the specialist."
South Africa say he will bat in their second innings "if absolutely necessary". A decision on whether a replacement will be called up has yet to be made.
Steyn's injury marred what was otherwise a superb day for the tourists, who fought back brilliantly after Australia reached 158-0 in reply to South Africa's first-innings' 242.
Before his injury, Steyn took the first wicket to fall, Australia opener David Warner, who top-scored with 97.
Seamer Vernon Philander took 4-56 and debutant left-arm spinner Keshav Maharaj 3-56 as Australia's 10 wickets fell for 86 runs in 35 overs.
