Barry Bennell: Ex-football coach charged with 14 further offences

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Ex-football coach Barry Bennell has been charged with a further 14 counts of historical sex abuse against boys, the Crown Prosecution Service has said.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The charges, which include indecent assault and sexual assault, involve four boys, who were aged between 11 and 14 at the time of the alleged offences.
The ex-Crewe youth coach is accused of a total of 55 offences between 1979 and 1991 against young boys.
The 63-year-old denied all accusations during previous court appearances.
Mr Bennell - who also coached a number of junior teams in north-west England and the Midlands, some with associations to Manchester City and Stoke City - will appear at South Cheshire Magistrates' Court via video-link on 28 June.
The latest accusations include four counts of indecent assault on a boy aged 11-14, four counts of indecent assault on a boy aged 11-12 and two counts of indecent assault on a boy aged 11-13.
He is also charged with four counts of sexual assault on a boy aged 11-14.
Last month, Bennell appeared at Crewe Magistrates' Court, where a further 21 child sex offences were put to him, but he did not enter a plea, and was remanded into custody.
