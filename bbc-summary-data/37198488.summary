Chris Porter reportedly damaged both ankles when jumping from a second-storey window to flee the knifeman who killed 21-year-old Mia Ayliffe-Chung.
Frenchman Smail Ayad, 29, has been charged with murdering Miss Ayliffe-Chung, from Wirksworth in Derbyshire.
In a Facebook post, Mr Porter described Mia as an "absolute gem".
"I'm truly devastated and heartbroken about what has happened and I'm still in shock," he wrote.
"Never thought I'd be heading back through that airport without Mia."
Mr Porter, from Kent, has been discharged from hospital and flown back to the Gold Coast.
He also wrote "get well soon" in reference to 30-year-old Tom Jackson, from Congleton in Cheshire, who was seriously injured when the knifeman struck at his head.
A 46-year-old local man, named by a friend as Grant Scholz, who ran the hostel also suffered non-life threatening injuries in the attacks.
As well as the murder charge, Mr Ayad has been charged with two counts of attempted murder, one count of serious animal cruelty and 12 counts of serious assault, in relation to 12 police officers.
The attacks happened at Shelley's Backpackers accommodation in the Home Hill area of Queensland at about 23:15 local time on Tuesday.
Police are investigating reports that Mr Ayad had an unrequited romantic interest or an "obsession" with Miss Ayliffe-Chung.
Supt Ray Rohweder, of Queensland Police, also said there was an indication that he had taken cannabis on Tuesday evening.
Police have confirmed he shouted "Allahu Akbar" during the attack but said there is no indication that radicalisation or political motives were involved.
Mr Ayad was due to before Townsville Magistrates' Court on Friday by video link, but did not appear as "he had caused a disturbance".
