The 23-year-old was sent home on Sunday from a training camp, with a replacement yet to be named.
"Boufal has left after examination of his injury showed he would not be capable of playing," the national team said in a statement.
Morocco have already lost midfielders Younes Belhanda, Oussame Tannane and Watford's Nordin Amrabat to injuries.
They play Finland in a friendly on Tuesday before heading to the tournament in Gabon, where their first match is against the Democratic Republic of Congo in Oyem on 16 January.
