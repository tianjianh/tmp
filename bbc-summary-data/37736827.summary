[SN]TITLE[SN]
Walsall 1-1 Coventry City

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Coventry City moved out of the League One relegation places, despite sharing the spoils with Walsall at the Bescot Stadium.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
City went closest in a hectic opening period, Ruben Lameiras curling inches wide from the edge of the box.
The Sky Blues took a deserved lead after 37 minutes as Andy Rose reacted quicker than the Walsall defence to turn home Marvin Sordell's low cross from 10 yards.
Walsall almost levelled before the break as Lee Burge spilled Adam Chambers' 30-yard shot, only for the City keeper to then recover and stop it crossing the line.
Coventry could have sealed the points early in the second half but Daniel Agyei's fierce near-post strike was kept out by Walsall goalkeeper Neil Etheridge.
And Walsall made City pay by levelling in the 76th minute with a delightful goal from Erhun Oztumer, who exchanged passes with Simeon Jackson before sliding his shot into the bottom corner from 15 yards.
Burge tipped over a Kieron Morris rocket two minutes later before both sides could have won it at the death.
Sordell lashed over from 15 yards for City before Oztumer teed up Liam Kinsella in stoppage time, only for the Saddlers substitute to drill wide.
