Yassar Yaqub, 28, from Huddersfield, was shot when police stopped a car near junction 24 of the M62 on Monday.
Dee Collins, West Yorkshire Police chief constable, said she understood the desire of Mr Yaqub's family "for answers to their unresolved questions".
She also extended sympathy to the dead man's family.
Her comments come on the day Mr Yaqub's funeral was held at the Jamia Masjid Bilal mosque in Huddersfield.
An inquest into his death was also opened and adjourned in Bradford.
The force's boss set up the meeting after protesters carrying banners saying "stop the killings" on Tuesday evening brought traffic to a halt in Leeds Road, Bradford.
During that protest earlier in the week, a police car was kicked and its wing mirror broken during the protest, although no arrests were made.
"I completely understand and empathise with the heightened community tensions and people's wish to peacefully demonstrate", Ms Collins said.
The police chief said she had met "politicians and community representatives" to discuss their concerns and how "to work together in the public interest" . Ms Collins said the discussions would continue.
However, she also said she could not "comment directly on the policing operation".
Monday's operation at Ainley Top, near junction 24 of the M62, is being investigated by the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC).
Ms Collins said its investigation had to "run its course, properly and thoroughly".
The IPCC has said post-mortem tests showed Mr Yaqub died of gunshot wounds to his chest. He was was shot by a West Yorkshire Police firearms officer.
Mr Yaqub was in the front passenger seat of a white Audi stopped by police. The IPCC has said a gun was found in the car.
On Wednesday about 100 people, including the dead man's parents, gathered near the site to lay flowers and light candles.
Meanwhile, Mohsin Amin, 30, from Dewsbury, who was arrested as part of the operation, has appeared in court charged with firearms offences.
