Fresh from getting an OBE in the New Year Honours, Coleman will join about 1,500 other runners for Nos Galan.
The race is held in Mountain Ash, Rhondda Cynon Taff, every 31 December.
Coleman, 46, called the race a "fantastic tradition" and said he was "very excited" and looking forward to a "great night".
He told BBC Wales he was glad not to have to complete the whole 3.1 mile (5km) race, adding: "We'd be there all night."
Nos Galan, founded in 1958, celebrates the life of Welsh runner Guto Nyth Bran, who died in 1737, aged 37.
Coleman will lay a wreath at the runner's grave in Llanwonno graveyard.
The mystery runner is meant to represent the spirit of Guto Nyth Bran and previous participants include rugby player Shane Williams, sprinter Linford Christie and cyclist Nicole Cooke.
"The tradition's fantastic, a huge history and I'm in great company with the people who've done this before me," said the Wales boss.
Traditionally, the race ended at midnight, but this was later changed to accommodate families wanting to watch and take part, so it now finishes at about 21:30 GMT.
There is a children's race, an elite race and a 3.1-mile (5km) adult fun run.
Chairwoman of the Nos Galan Committee, Ann Crimmings, said: "The appearance of such a sporting icon as Chris Coleman will no doubt boost the popularity of our event even further as he has decided to bring such a memorable year for himself and the Wales team to a close on the streets of Mountain Ash."
