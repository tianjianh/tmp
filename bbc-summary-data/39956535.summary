Gylfi Sigurdsson says he is happy at Swansea City despite speculation linking him with a move away.

Everton are among the clubs to have shown an interest in the 27-year-old Iceland midfielder.
But such links have not unsettled Sigurdsson, who was named Swansea's players' and supporters' player of the year for a second successive season on Wednesday.
"I'm not trying to leave or want to leave," he said.
"I signed a new contract in the summer and I've got three years left, so it's down to the club if they want to sell me.
"It's down to them, but I'm very happy here."
Sigurdsson's accolades at Swansea's end-of-season awards ceremony were reward for a campaign in which he scored nine goals and assisted 13.
That tally was particularly impressive given the fact the Swans have spent the season deep in relegation trouble, before eventually securing survival with one game to spare.
"It has been easy in the last couple of months because we've been in a very serious position in the league, so it's been easy to concentrate on that," Sigurdsson added.
"I think it'll continue to be like that because whatever happens, happens.
"I'm not desperate to go or anything. It's not like I want to go, it's just very calm and I'm not focused or concentrating on what people are writing."
Sigurdsson joined Swansea from Tottenham in 2014, having previously played for the Welsh club on loan.
He played a prominent role in Iceland's run to the Euro 2016 quarter-finals and, with his form attracting interest from other sides, Swansea sought to secure his future by making him the club's best paid player with a new four-year contract last summer.
After this season's flirtation with relegation, Sigurdsson believes the Swans will improve in the next campaign.
"You only have to look at the coaching staff who came in. They're top notch and Paul [Clement, Swansea's head coach] knows what he's doing," he said.
"You could see that from the first day. He's been outstanding and he managed to change the mood, the atmosphere and the confidence of the team.
"I think for as long as he's here the club is in really good hands."
