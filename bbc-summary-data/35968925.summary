Jazz Carlin targets Rio Olympic place after London heartache

Jazz Carlin hopes four "rollercoaster" years will culminate in qualification for her first Olympics at the British trials in Glasgow next week.

The Welsh swimmer, 25, missed London 2012 after suffering glandular fever ahead of those trials, before missing out on a 2013 World Championship medal.
A historic 2014 Commonwealth gold and maiden Worlds honour followed in 2015.
"A lot of people say 'oh you're already going to the Olympics,' but you need to perform at the trials," she said.
"Unlike last time [in 2012] the preparation has been great and I've had a solid block over in Australia training outdoors with the warmth which gives you a great boost."
With Carlin's long-term coach Bud McAllister opting to move to Australia the swimmer took the bold move to leave her base in Swansea and relocate to Bath under Dave McNulty in late 2014.
The move paid dividends with 800m world bronze in 2015 and she is edging closer to Rebecca Adlington's British record of eight minutes, 14.10 seconds - which was the former world record - in the event.
"It was nerve-wracking moving programmes to be with a new coach and setup but it was great to come away with a World bronze and two European short course golds," she said.
"It's all about the Rio Olympics though, the trials are a stepping stone and I'm excited to get racing."
In addition to the 800m she will also contest the 400m and 200m freestyle races in Glasgow.
The next major event following the trials will be the 2016 European Championships, back at the venue where she missed out on Olympic selection - the London Aquatics Centre.
"The journey since 2012 has been a rollercoaster, but I think home support will be great and the European competition is world class," said Carlin.
"It's every athlete's dream go to the Olympics and London will be great build-up.
"I just have to swim well, eat well, rest well, look after myself and hopefully that will be enough."
