The 25-year-old joins the Shrimpers after two seasons with the Scottish Championship side.
Oxley, who started his career at Rotherham, will compete with Ted Smith for the number one jersey at Roots Hall after Dan Bentley joined Brentford.
He still had a year to run on his deal with the Hibees but decided to take up an option to leave Easter Road.
It is the second time Oxley will work with Southend boss Phil Brown after playing under him at Hull City.
"I paid a fee for Mark when he was a kid at Rotherham and I could see the potential in him from a young age," Brown told the club website.
"I've always kept an interest in him and after having an operation about four years ago he has played over 120 competitive matches at a very good standard of football."
