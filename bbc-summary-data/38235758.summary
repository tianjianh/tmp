A sculpture made out of tons of old horseshoes has been put up in the home town of Olympic showjumping gold medallist Scott Brash.

The 10ft (3m) high design stands on the Edinburgh Road in Peebles.
Commissioned by the Bonnie Peebles committee it took Kev Paxton and his team at Edinburgh-based ArtFe thousands of man hours to complete.
The sculpture includes four horseshoes from Hello Sanctos, the horse on which Brash won gold at the 2012 Olympics.
Brash became the first person to win showjumping's grand slam last year aboard the same horse.
Community group Bonnie Peebles said they wanted to "recognise the amazing achievements of local lad Scott Brash who has gone on to be world number one showjumper".
Artist Mr Paxton said: "We try to make everything we do unique and as soon as we were approached about this project, we knew the direction we wanted to take.
"I have Borders blood in me and felt connected to the idea right from the start."
The Bonnie Peebles committee raised all the funds for the project via private donations and local fundraising.
