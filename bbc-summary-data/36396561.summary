The former Leicester City trainee, 29, was Vale's longest-serving player, with 56 goals from 332 appearances in over eight seasons at the club.
He netted eight goals in 44 games this season, his second-best scoring return.
Dodds is Town manager Micky Mellon's third summer signing, following Gary Deegan and Oliver Lancashire.
"I have some of the greatest memories at Port Vale which made the decision to leave the hardest one I've ever had to make," said Dodds.
"I am truly grateful to the club, the coaching staff, the players and the fans for how I've been treated and what I have learnt from my time here."
As well as releasing eight players, Mellon has also placed midfielder Richie Wellens on the transfer list.
"I've spoken to Richie about the situation," said Mellon. "We've decided it is best if we make him available for a free transfer.
"I get on very well with him and felt that it was best that he goes onto the next chapter of his career."
