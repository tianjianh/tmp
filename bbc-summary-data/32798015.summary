The proposals for Shifnal were awarded outline approval last year and councillors have now backed the detailed plans.
It will also see new roads, footpaths and green areas built near Coppice Green.
The development by Barratt West Midlands and David Wilson Homes forms part of a plan to build 1,600 homes in Shifnal by 2026.
Shropshire Council received 13 objections to the scheme, including concerns about additional traffic in the area and pressure on services.
The head of nearby Idsall School did not object to the proposals but raised concerns about lack of classroom space.
