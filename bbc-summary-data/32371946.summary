Crackdown on caravans being used as permanent homes

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A campaign to stop caravans being used as permanent homes is being stepped up in Denbighshire.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Councillors are concerned about people using caravans as their main residences and avoiding council tax while still using services like schools.
In 2013 the council estimated there were 6,000 static pitches and 900 touring pitches in the county.
The council is to consider a report that says caravans provide sub-standard accommodation for permanent residence.
