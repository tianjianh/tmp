South West Water (SWW) said it was working to fix the Gannel sewage station in Newquay after it became aware of a problem at 23:30 GMT on Thursday.
Sewage is affecting the sea at beaches around Towan Head as well as Crantock and Fistral, said SWW.
The company tweeted: "Sorry if this affects your NYD plans."
Operations manager Mike Galligan said: "We are sorry if this affects anyone's plans for a New Year's Day dip or surf.
"We are working night and day to fix the issue as quickly as possible."
