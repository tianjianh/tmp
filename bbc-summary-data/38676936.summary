[SN]TITLE[SN]
Plan for Edinburgh tourist tax next spring

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A tourist tax could be in place in Edinburgh from spring 2018 if a City Deal for the region is given the go-ahead, according to the council leader.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Councils in Fife, the Lothians, and the Borders have joined together to bid for up to Â£2bn from a scheme aimed at stimulating investment that involves both the UK and Scottish governments.
The deal would grant councils the power to introduce a levy on visitors.
It is likely that the money would be ringfenced for culture and leisure use.
A final decision on the City Deal - similar to those signed in Glasgow and Aberdeen - is expected in March.
