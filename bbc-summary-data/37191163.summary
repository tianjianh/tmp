[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A baby girl found dead in a black bag on an footpath was stillborn, a coroner has ruled.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The infant, still with its umbilical cord attached, was found by a member of the public in Marston, Oxford, on 29 February.
Thames Valley Police has still not traced her mother and have continued to urge her to come forward over concerns for her health.
The baby was discovered with no signs of injury in bushes on Edgeway Road.
A police spokesman added it was not believed the baby, who weighed 8lbs, was born there.
A funeral will be held for the child, but a date has not yet been announced.
