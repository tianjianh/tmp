The 23-year-old will rise to 169th from 218th in Monday's updated rankings.
Her career has been blighted by three years of wrist problems and she has not played in the main draw of a WTA event since August's US Open.
Robson, who was ranked as high as 27th in 2013, has dropped down to a level below the WTA to regain form.
