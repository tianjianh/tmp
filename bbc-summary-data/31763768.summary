Bestival has revealed an all-female line-up in its second wave of announcements for this year's Isle of Wight event.

Charli XCX, Ella Eyre and Lianne La Havas will appear alongside The Chemical Brothers and Underworld.
Other festivals have been criticised for the lack of women on their bills.
Last week, music blog Crack in the Road posted images of edited posters removing all the names of male performers.
The rather blank-looking page was shared on social media, with the bills at Reading and Leeds, Download and T in the Park also a focus for criticism.
Neneh Cherry, Andreya Triana and Radio 1 DJ B.Traits are among other female acts to be announced by Bestival.
Organiser Rob da Bank said: "There are shed-loads of amazing people making some startlingly good music at the moment and look, lots of them are female."
This year's Bestival theme is Summer of Love.
It takes place at Robin Hill Country Park on the Isle of Wight between 10 and 13 September, with 25 stages on offer.
