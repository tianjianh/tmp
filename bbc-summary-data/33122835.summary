Glastonbury Abbey 'halfway' in appeal to save ruins

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Bosses at Glastonbury Abbey have said the site still needs to raise around £240,000 to save its ancient ruins.

The abbey launched its Rescue Our Ruins appeal in May 2012 with the goal of raising £500,000 - a pound for every person living in Somerset.
Events co-ordinator James Stone told the BBC there was "a long way to go" in funding efforts.
The appeal has already helped restore key features including the Lady Chapel and the Abbot's Kitchen.
It also wants to save the North Wall, the oldest standing part of the abbey, dating from the Norman period.
The Abbot's Kitchen, in the grounds of the abbey, was built in the 14th Century, and is one of the world's few surviving medieval kitchens.
It reopened in April last year following a year of conservation work.
Mr Stone said: "The abbey itself has had to raise about £500,000 and we're about halfway there.
"We've still got a long way to go and we're still looking to raise money.
"It's been about a three-year project to conserve and keep these beautiful buildings here for future generations to enjoy."
