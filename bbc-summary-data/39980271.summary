The 22-year-old, who can play at right-back, centre-half and in midfield, scored twice in 33 appearances in 2016-17 as the Magpies finished 16th.
Hewitt began his career at Macclesfield, and joined County in August 2015 after leaving Ipswich.
"I would like to say a big thank you to the manager and chairman for the faith they've shown in me," said Hewitt.
