[SN]TITLE[SN]
Poland 2-2 Scotland

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A ferociously-struck Arkadiusz Milik equaliser denied Scotland a famous win in Warsaw, but a hard-fought point was an impressive result for the visitors.

Poland threw everything at the Scots in the second half after going 2-1 behind to a clever Steven Naismith finish.
Earlier, Krzysztof Maczynski's cooly-converted opener was cancelled out by Shaun Maloney's equally calm strike.
But Milik earned the Poles a deserved point and Kamil Grosicki almost struck a winner when his effort struck a post.
The result ensured Poland kept pace with the Republic of Ireland at the summit of a delicately-poised Group D after Martin O'Neill's side drew 1-1 with Germany.
The world champions - who were beaten in Warsaw on Saturday - are level with Scotland three points back, with the Irish travelling to Celtic Park in November.
Another surprise appeared to be on the cards when Gordon Strachan's side took the lead early in the second half on Tuesday, but there was to be no repeat of the friendly win in March.
There was, however, plenty of poise about Scotland's performance, a trait that is becoming more and more evident under Strachan.
And though they were put under significant pressure as the game wore on, a combination of stout defending and poor finishing meant that they left with a point.
It will be a cherished point, too, given that Milik had already passed up three chances before he scored and Robert Lewandowski had a shot saved superbly by Marshall.
The Poles came into the match in buoyant mood and their confidence was enhanced after a rare Scottish defensive lapse allowed them to take the lead.
Alan Hutton the guilty party, his heavy touch on the edge of his own box presenting Maczynski with the chance and the midfielder took it in clinical fashion, side-footing off the inside of Marshall's left-hand post and over the line.
But the home fans had scarcely stopped celebrating when the Scots drew level with a wonderfully crafted goal.
Steven Fletcher switched play to Ikechi Anya on the left and the winger's cutback was slotted expertly past Wojciech Szczesny by Maloney from 10 yards.
Steven Whittaker was a surprise inclusion ahead of Andrew Robertson at left-back but the defender prevented a seemingly certain second Polish goal, nipping in ahead of Lewandowski to clear with the goal gaping.
That seemed to have paved the way for Naismith to give the Scots victory when he guided a James Morrison free-kick past Szczesny, but Milik had other ideas, ripping a strike past Marshall after Artur Jedrzejczyk's reverse pass.
