Wrexham-based Sgt Laura Salisbury-Jones has received North Wales Police's diversity champion award.
Ms Salisbury-Jones can use sign language and is able to engage with the deaf community and identify those in need of police support.
She will now teach officers basic tips to assist communication and deliver an introduction to the language.
"It is important that all communities are able to access the services North Wales Police provides and I would like to thank the deaf community for their willingness to engage with us," she said.
Greg George, head of diversity at North Wales Police, said: "In her own time, she has completed levels 1, 2, 3 and 4 in BSL (British Sign Language) and plans to continue this amazing achievement by becoming the force's first fully qualified BSL interpreter.''
