The English National Ballet's Lest We Forget - inspired by the centenary of WWI - is up against The Royal Ballet and Ballet Black for the dance award.
The awards will be hosted by South Bank Show presenter Melvyn Bragg in June.
He praised the high standard of nominees: "Yet again we turn up with a cracking range of talent across the arts. At present, British artists are on song. Many of those nominated are not only British, but world class artists."
The South Bank Sky Arts Awards recognise the best in genres of the arts including dance, opera, comedy, TV drama, literature, classical music, pop, film, visual art and theatre.
Lord Bragg will host the event at The Savoy Hotel on 7 June, with the ceremony being aired on Sky Arts 1 on 10 June at 8.00pm.
The film award will see sci-fi hit Under the Skin (starring Scarlett Johansson) fight it out with Paddington and the uplifting gay rights film Pride.
The Almeida/Wyndham Theatre's King Charles III will take on both his ancient ancestor Henry IV (Donmar Warehouse) and The Young Vic's A View from the Bridge for the theatre award.
The BBC has been nominated five times in the TV drama and comedy category with BBC Two's The Honourable Woman, Line of Duty, W1A, The Trip to Italy and Happy Valley all nominated. Sky Living's Doll & Em is also up for the comedy gong.
The Royal Opera House's Die Frau Ohne Schatten, David Nicholls' tale of a marriage in crisis Us; and the Arditti Quartet's 40 Years Young compete amongst their peers for the opera, literature and classical music categories respectively.
This year's award has been designed by Miriam Woolf, a 22-year-old student at The Glasgow School of Art.
Phil Edgar-Jones, Director of Sky Arts, said: "Arts and Culture in the UK and Ireland is as vibrant and exciting and popular (and fun) as it's ever been, and there really is no other awards event that celebrates the range, diversity and sheer brilliance of Arts talent across the spectrum.
"I am doubly thrilled this year that the award itself has been designed by a student from the Glasgow School of Art, recognising the great work the school has done over the years."
