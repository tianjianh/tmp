Esteban Gutierrez: Ex-Haas driver to race in Formula E

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Former Haas driver Esteban Gutierrez will compete in the Formula E race in his native Mexico after losing his seat for the 2017 Formula 1 season.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Gutierrez, 25, failed to score a point in 2016 and was replaced by Kevin Magnussen as Romain Grosjean's partner.
Any hopes he had of staying in F1 for next season were dealt a blow by Manor entering administration last week.
The former Ferrari reserve has not revealed which team he will represent in the electric race on 1 April.
