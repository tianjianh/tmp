The 22-year-old, who becomes the Royals' eighth signing of the summer, has agreed a three-year deal at the Madejski Stadium.
Harriott came through the youth ranks at Charlton and scored 12 goals in 95 appearances for the Addicks.
"Callum is difficult for opponents to predict and will be a great asset," Reading boss Jaap Stam said.
Harriott made 21 appearances for Charlton last season as the south-east London club were relegated to League One.
