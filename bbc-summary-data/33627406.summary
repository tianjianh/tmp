A cricketer who lost his leg to bone cancer is back playing the sport.

Tom Carter, 21, had to take two years off after being diagnosed and having his leg amputated above the knee.
Now he is back playing for Newport Cricket Club's fourth team and coaches the under-13s B team.
Mr Carter said: "I'm just happy to be back on the pitch playing for Newport. I'm still adapting my batting now I've got one leg as I can't play certain shots the way I used to."
The former seconds player's prosthetic leg is fitted with a microprocessor to give him more mobility and stability.
Mr Carter is allowed to have a runner when batting and fields in the slips or other positions close to the wicket.
He is also involved with the Wales disability cricket team.
Cricket Wales chief executive Peter Hybart said: "Tom is a real inspiration. He has come through an awful time, but thanks to the support of family, friends and the cricket community, he is again able to play the sport he loves."
