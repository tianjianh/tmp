The sea front manager for Weston-super-Mare has told the BBC he is "confident" all of the town's 24 new beach huts will be let for this year.

The first phase of year-long leases were offered on an online auction site earlier this year - 21 sold but three failed to reach the reserve price.
The unfurnished buildings, all in pastel shades of blue, green and lilac, are on the promenade at Royal Sands.
The first lease sold online in April for Â£2,650.
Darren Fairchild said permission was initially granted for 97 huts this year, but it may now change.
"I think the reality is we're always trying to strike a happy balance between the residents' views and the open areas that we like to create," he added.
"I don't think we're going to go for 97 [beach huts]. I think there maybe another phase next year.
"We'll see at the end of the year how popular they are again, how many people want to renew, and how many new applications we'll get."
In March, North Somerset Council granted permission for more than 100 beach huts - 28 at Marine Parade and a further 97 on The Promenade - each with no fixed price.
One man from Bristol, who has already picked up the keys to his hut, said: "When we saw that the beach huts were available it seemed like a great thing - to be on the beach, have the views, and the ability to pop inside when it rains a bit too much."
Beach huts were first introduced in Weston-super-Mare in the 1930s, in exactly the same place as the huts are now, Mr Fairchild said.
