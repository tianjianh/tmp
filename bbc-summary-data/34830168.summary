The teenager was found on a towpath near Burrows Court, Eldonian Village, in the Vauxhall area of the city, by a member of the public at about 23:10 GMT on Sunday.
He was taken to the Royal Liverpool University Hospital, where he died a short while later, police said.
Police have launched a murder investigation and forensic examinations are being carried out.
The boy's next of kin have been informed.
Updates on this story and more from Merseyside and Cheshire.
Officers said they are trying to establish a motive for the shooting and high visibility patrols have been stepped up in the area to reassure the public. House-to-house inquiries are under way.
At the scene

The Leeds-Liverpool canal, which runs through the Eldonian Village, has been cordoned off at both sides and there are plenty of police vehicles here, with many people having to alter their walk to school.
Burrows Court residents tell me youngsters do come here to smoke but there's very little trouble normally and they are mystified by what's happened.
