Mr Hamilton said the UKIP MEP for the North West of England and deputy leader was "streets ahead" of anyone else in the contest.
He said he would not support UKIP Wales leader Nathan Gill, who has not ruled himself out.
A contest was triggered after Nigel Farage announced he would resign from the leadership of the party.
Mr Hamilton, when asked how he would feel if Mr Gill was to run, he said: "Personally, he wouldn't be my candidate."
"I'm backing Paul Nuttall. I've known him for a very long time," Mr Hamilton told the BBC's Good Morning Wales programme.
"I think the future of UKIP is to hoover up the votes of disgruntled ex-Labour voters.
"Paul as an authentic Scouser from Liverpool is an authentic voice of northern working class England.
"I think he will appeal to Wales as well.
"Paul has a big presence, and he's a very good platform speaker as well. I've seen Paul campaigning up and down the country. I think he is streets ahead of anyone else in this contest."
