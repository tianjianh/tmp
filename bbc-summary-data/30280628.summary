The woman collided with a car at 08:50 GMT on Broad Street, Teddington. Ambulances were sent but both were diverted to other incidents.
Lib Dem London Assembly Member Stephen Knight said he was "horrified".
London Ambulance Service (LAS) said it was "sorry" but had remained in contact with the patient until paramedics arrived at 10:27.
Writing about the incident, Mr Knight tweeted: "Horrified that a cyclist was left in the middle of the road in central Teddington this morning for over an hour before the ambulance arrived."
LAS said it had "remained in contact with the patient throughout who had lower back pain but was not in a serious condition" and it knew she was "conscious, breathing and alert".
The woman was taken to West Middlesex Hospital where her condition was described as "stable".
LAS added: "We are very sorry we couldn't be there sooner and for any distress or discomfort this may have caused but we have to prioritise patients in a serious or life-threatening condition."
