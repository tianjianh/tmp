The charges relate to two incidents during Saturday's west London derby, which ended in a 1-1 draw.
The first was a clash between the two clubs' coaching staff in the 91st minute, with the second a melee involving players in the 94th minute.
QPR assistant Marc Bircham and Fulham's medical manager Marco Cesarini have received improper conduct charges.
All parties have until 18:00 GMT on Thursday, 26 January to respond.
Both clubs have been charged with failing to "ensure their players and/or officials conducted themselves in an orderly fashion".
Fulham pair Tom Cairney and Chris Martin and QPR defender Joel Lynch were all booked by referee Keith Stroud following an off-the-ball incident in the 94th minute.
