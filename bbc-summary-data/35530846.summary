He will replace Bill Turnbull who announced in September that, after 15 years, he was leaving the programme.
Walker currently hosts Football Focus, BBC One's Saturday lunchtime football show, and Afternoon Edition on BBC Radio 5 live.
He'll co-present the daily morning programme from Monday to Wednesday with Louise Minchin.
Walker said he was "thrilled" to be joining the BBC Breakfast team.
"I have watched the show avidly over the years and am even looking forward to setting my alarm clock and doing what I can to make it even more successful," he said.
His career began on Sheffield's Hallam FM Radio, before moving to Manchester's KEY103 radio station.
After stints at Granada TV and BBC North West Tonight, he went on to join BBC Sport.
Turnbull will present his final show on 26 February with Walker starting his duties on 29 February.
He joins a roster of presenters that also includes Louise Minchin, Charlie Stayt and Naga Munchetty.
Speaking about his predecessor, Walker said: "It is an honour to be given this opportunity and to follow in the footsteps of someone like Bill Turnbull.
"The man has significant shoes to fill so I hope I can do as good a job as he did waking up the nation."
Walker will continue presenting Football Focus but will no longer be hosting Afternoon Edition on BBC Radio 5 live in light of his new role.
Turnbull has fronted the programme for the past 15 years, but announced he was leaving the programme last year.
BBC Breakfast is broadcast daily on BBC One from 06:00.
