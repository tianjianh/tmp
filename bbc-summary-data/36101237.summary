Carlisle United boss Keith Curle has said playing away could benefit his side as they bid to maintain their slim chances of a League Two play-off place.

The Cumbrians lie seven points off the last play-off spot with two of their final three matches away from home.
"Sometimes you think it might be a slight advantage playing away from home," Curle told BBC Radio Cumbria.
"Supporters get nervous which affects the players. Anxiousness can creep on and players go into their shell."
Carlisle travel to Crawley on 23 April, face Oxford at home on 30 April and play their final League Two game of the season away at Notts County.
"We will do what we have done all season and take each game as it comes," Curle continued. "The opposition will be given the respect they deserve but ultimately we can be competitive in every single game.
"The important thing is we keep our own house in order and what the others do is down to them. We've got a full squad and I've got to pick the right team and the players have got to perform."
Despite being forced to play home matches at Preston, Blackburn and Blackpool after their Brunton Park home was flooded in the aftermath of Storm Desmond, Carlisle's fortunes have fared better on the pitch this term.
He added: "As a football club we've come a very long way in a short space of time. It's a massive turnaround, not just from the players and coaching staff, but everybody associated with the football club.
"There's been a lot of distractions this season but we're on an upward spiral."
