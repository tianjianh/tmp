Equality progress in Wales still 'leaves many behind'

Life for many young, disabled, or poorer people is failing to improve despite greater equality in Welsh society, a senior official has warned.

Ann Beynon, equality and human rights commissioner for Wales, said "the gateway to opportunity remains harder to pass through for some groups", including ethnic minorities.
It follows a review of progress on equality over the last five years.
Education, employment and mental health services were said to need improvement.
In a report - Is Britain Fairer? - the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) said life had become better for many people but worse for others.
It highlighted key challenges for Wales:
Ms Beynon said: "This report shows that progress towards equality has been made for some people in certain areas of life.
"However, many people are being left behind."
She promised a fuller report on Wales in December, adding:  "We want to see political parties responding to the challenges set by the evidence we are presenting.
"The Equality and Human Rights Commission has a crucial role in ensuring our evidence is a catalyst for change but everyone has an important part to play in achieving a fairer Wales."
Public consultation events on the commission's work will be held in November and December.
Responding to the report, a Welsh government official said the review showed good progress on areas such as homelessness and decreasing mental health stigma.
They added: "While the UK Government's ongoing austerity measures are hitting Welsh families hard, we will continue to do all we can to increase prosperity and promote fairness and equality across Wales."
