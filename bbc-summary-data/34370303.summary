Residents and businesses near a proposed new link road are being asked to give their views on the scheme.

It will connect the Slyfield Industrial Estate with Clay Lane, in Jacobs Well, Surrey, and cost an estimated Â£7.3m.
Residents have said while improving access to the estate, it will cross green belt land and a flood plain, with low lying properties at risk of floods.
Guildford Borough Council said the link road would attract new businesses, and help retain and create new jobs.
It said the industrial estate, north of Guildford, was an important economic hub providing more than 2,000 jobs.
As part of a consultation process, which closes on 6 November, there will be four drop-in events around the borough during October allowing people to view the plans.
Members of the project team will also be available at the events to discuss specific aspects of the proposals and listen to comments.
The council plans to submit a planning application early next year, and hopes to have final approval by the summer.
