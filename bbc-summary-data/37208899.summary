Moses John: Police call on clergymen and churchgoers for help

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Detectives believe clergymen and churchgoers could have clues to the whereabouts of a vulnerable teenager missing for more than a year.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Moses John and his mother Pauline Watson disappeared from their home in Northamptonshire in May 2015 and are thought to be in London.
Moses, 14, who has special educational needs, was at the centre of family court litigation.
Police have now said it is likely Ms Watson has attended church services.
Investigating officers want church ministers or members of congregations to come forward if they have information.
Det Sgt Nickie Deeks of Northamptonshire Police said: "It is likely that Moses' mother has attended church services
"It may even be that she has asked a clergyman for help or advice."
Moses is black and about 5ft 9in (178cm) tall. His mother is also black and around 5ft 7in (174cm).
They said Ms Watson is from Jamaica and is thought to have links to areas of London including Croydon, Islington, Merton, Sutton, Southwark and Lambeth.
Det Sgt Deeks added: "We would urge all clergymen, church ministers and churchgoers - particularly in the London area - to think very carefully about whether they might have seen or had contact with Moses or his mother.
"They may have been faces in a congregation, they may have been at church events, they may have needed help.
"We would urge anyone who thinks they might have any information to please get in touch."
Mr Justice Keehan said in May that Moses was vulnerable.
"I am gravely concerned for his welfare," the judge said.
"It is imperative, in his welfare best interests, that his current whereabouts are made known."
