Middlesbrough believe they can avoid relegation from the Premier League this season despite their precarious league position, says head coach Steve Agnew.

Boro, in 19th place, are currently six points adrift of safety with seven games remaining.
The last of the Teesiders' four league wins was on 17 December last year and they are the lowest scorers with only 22 goals from 31 matches.
"It's a massive run in for us," Agnew, 51, told BBC Tees.
"We're six points off with a game in hand and it's all to play for. The players are determined to stay with it, and a break is something we deserve."
Boro's home crowd for Saturday's goalless draw with Burnley almost topped 30,000 - a show of support despite the struggles on the field.
While the team were unable to turn their 12th draw of the season into a win, Agnew, who wants the head coach's job permanently, appreciates the influence of supporters on the performance.
"You could feel that the 12th man is everything we need right to the end," Agnew said.
"I know for a fact we'll have that support to the very end. If we stay together and get the goal we're more than capable of picking the three points up that will virtually change everything."
Boro do have a superior goal difference to their main rivals for relegation - Sunderland, Swansea City and Hull City - and take on Arsenal at home in the their match on Monday, 17 April.
