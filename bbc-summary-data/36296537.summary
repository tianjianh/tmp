The 27-year-old flyweight became the fastest Welsh boxer to win a British title with a points victory over Louis Norman at Ice Arena Wales in Cardiff.
It was the Barry fighter's fifth outing as a professional, having made his debut in October 2015.
"I want to be world champion, but there is no rush," said Selby, brother of IBF featherweight champion Lee Selby.
"Get some more 12 rounds in, maybe defend it, go for the European [title].
"There is no point chucking me into the deep end straight away because I have only had one 12-round fight."
No Welsh fighter has claimed a Lonsdale belt in fewer bouts and in less time since turning professional.
Norman, 32, had lost only one of his previous 13 contests.
Norman weighed in 0.9lbs over the eight-stone limit, but made the weight with seconds to spare after stripping completely naked.
The fight was on the undercard of Lee Haskins' successful IBF world bantamweight title defence against Ivan Morales and Selby says it was a great occasion at Wales' new boxing venue.
"It's the belt I've always wanted since I was a little kid," he said.
"Winning in my home town, in front of all my friends and family, you couldn't ask for better. It's a dream.
"You could just hear everyone screaming... I'd enjoy fighting here again."
