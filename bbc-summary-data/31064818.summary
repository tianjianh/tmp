[SN]TITLE[SN]
Bid to restore Powis Castle's crumbling east front

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The crumbling former main entrance of a mid Wales castle that once welcomed King George V could be reopened to the public for the first time in half a century.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The National Trust has asked for help to raise Â£300,000 towards the Â£500,000 needed to restore Powis Castle's eastern front.
It has been hidden behind locked gates since the trust took it over in 1952.
It is now closed off because it is unsafe and to prevent further damage.
The trust said repair work was urgently needed because damp was eroding the wall holding up the high terrace, which could soon affect the structural stability of the castle's east side.
Work is scheduled to begin in summer and it is hoped the necessary funds will be in place by 27 February.
