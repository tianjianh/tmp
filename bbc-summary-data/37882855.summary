A fund set up to support jockey Freddy Tylicki after he was paralysed from the waist down in a fall at Kempton on Monday has raised more than £100,000.

Tylicki suffered a T7 paralysis in a four-horse pile-up riding Nellie Dean.
James Fanshawe, who trained the Tylicki mount Speedy Boarding to victory in May's Prix Jean Romanet at Deauville, was among paying tribute.
"Freddy has a tremendous character and this will help him with the battle ahead," he said.
The sport was united in support for Tylicki, said Professional Jockeys Association chief executive Paul Struthers.
"Racing may have many issues and flaws but its biggest strength is how it pulls together in difficult, tragic times," he said.
"Freddy is one of the most popular members of the weighing room and will not lack for support, with offers already flooding in."
At The Races presenter Matt Chapman set up a GoFundMe page to raise money for Tylicki's recovery, which has already far surpassed its target of £20,000.
He wrote on the page: "We all know the risks jockeys take, and we all know they know the risks. But when one gets badly hurt those of us who love the game, bet on the game, need the game, have the opportunity to come together and say: 'You know what? We can help this person.'
"Freddy Tylicki is going to need loads of help."
Steve Drowne, who avoided injury when his mount, Skara Mae, was brought down in the same incident, added: "He is everyone's friend and he loved doing what he was doing and had just had his best year ever, getting a couple of Group Ones in the book. But racing is probably the last thing he is thinking about now."
Emerging Newmarket-based trainer Charlie Fellowes said he would always be thankful to Tylicki for providing him with his first winner on a day that he described as the "happiest of my life".
Tylicki rode Barbary to victory in a seven-furlong handicap at Lingfield in February 2014.
Fellowes said: "He is the happiest, most genuine guy you will come across. He always came in with a smile on his face and he would never be in a bad mood."
Rod Millman, who employed Tylicki more than any other trainer this year, believes the rider's character will help him in the future.
"This was the news we were dreading all week and the whole yard is devastated. He does, though, have great spirit and I'm sure that will see him through," he said.
The stewards on duty at Kempton on Monday concluded the incident was accidental, and the British Horseracing Authority has no plans for a further review.
"Thankfully, incidents such as these are a rare occurrence but we are not complacent and the issue of racecourse safety is one that we keep under constant review," said a spokesman.
