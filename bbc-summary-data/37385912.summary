Agustin Sula, 18, struck Mateusz Szleper, 21, seven times in the chest with a seven inch (20cm)-long combat knife and then fled the scene near Spring Bank.
Mr Szleper had been collecting food from a takeaway when Sula followed him and attacked him in February, Hull Crown Court heard.
He will be sentenced later this month.

The court heard Mr Szleper was a stranger but Sula, described as being fascinated with knives, had thought he had bumped into him earlier that evening.
He was described by a witness as being in a "very volatile state of mind" afterwards and went to search for Szleper.
After the murder, Sula, of no fixed abode but from Albania, hid the knife in bushes and washed his clothing.
He fled Hull and was arrested 10 days later while working at a car wash in Birmingham.
Two other men were also accused of murder.
Abdullah Ali Haydar, 18, of Alexandra Road, Hull was found not guilty.
The jury was discharged after failing to reach a verdict in the case of his Sula's brother, Ermal Sula, 24, of no fixed abode.
