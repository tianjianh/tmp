[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
May Lewis, 96, was killed after falling 20ft (6m) at Pontcanna House Care Home in Cardiff in 2012.
Carer Carol Conway, who walked backwards into the lift with Mrs Lewis in a wheelchair, also sustained life-threatening injuries.
On Tuesday, Shirwan and Nasik Al-Mufti admitted two serious health and safety breaches at Cardiff Crown Court.
The court heard the lift had been locked due to a fault but an emergency key was regularly used by staff to manually open the doors which would override the safety features.
Ms Conway had waited for the bell to sound but the platform for the lift had not arrived and the pair fell down two floors.
Prosecuting, Cardiff council said both Mr and Mrs Dr Al-Mufti were legally responsible for the safety of their staff and residents.
The court was told health and safety fell below the expected standards, that Mr and Mrs Dr Al-Mufti failed to adhere to warnings that the emergency key should not be used and they failed to have adequate risk assessments or training for their staff to use the lift.
