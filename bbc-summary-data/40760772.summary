[SN]TITLE[SN]
Aston Villa 1-1 Hull City

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Jarrod Bowen scored his first Hull City goal as the Tigers came from behind to draw at Aston Villa, who gave a debut to former England captain John Terry.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Bowen, 20, deservedly levelled on the hour mark, sending a smart volley past Villa goalkeeper Sam Johnstone.
The hosts had created numerous opportunities before the break, but only had Gabby Agbonlahor's far-post tap-in to show for their dominance.
Terry, who joined in the summer after leaving Chelsea, played the full game.
The 36-year-old, capped 78 times by England, took the captain's armband and looked assured in marshalling the home side's backline - but he was unable to cap his debut with a clean sheet.
Having spent large periods of the second half camped in Villa territory without carving out a clear sight of goal, Bowen eventually found space in the area to send a sharp finish into the bottom corner.
The Tigers, relegated from the Premier League in May, still nearly conceded a late second but Andre Green could only send a header bouncing over with the goal at his mercy.
