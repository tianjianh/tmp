National League leaders Lincoln have signed midfielder Tom Champion on a 93-day loan from League Two side Barnet.

The Barnet-born 30-year-old began his career at his home-town club, but joined Cambridge in July 2013.
He helped the U's to promotion to League Two and win the FA Trophy, before moving back to Barnet last year.
Lincoln are currently two points clear of second-placed Forest Green and Champion goes straight into the squad for Tuesday's match with Solihull.
