Mr Kumar told the court he was sitting at a table in a meeting room when two gunmen entered the warehouse at about 18:30 GMT on 3 February.
Giving evidence with the help of a Hindi interpreter, he said they had seen a car pull up in the car park before one of the men showed them a gun.
"At first we thought somebody was making fun of us and they showed it to us again and at that time we just raised our hands," he said.
Mr Kumar said Mr Javeed was bound by the wrist and taken outside while he was tied together to two other staff members in a separate office.
He told the court he then heard gunshots before the men left the scene.
He said: "I was frightened and after that I was frightened for months, even when in the house I was scared."
The prosecution told the court Mr Mistry, of Laundon Way, Leicester, and Mr Zarif, of Osmaston Park Road in Derby, were the men filmed entering the warehouse, with Mr Wali, also of Osmaston Park Road in Derby, acting as the driver.
As well as facing a charge of murder, Mr Mistry and Mr Wali are also accused of conspiracy to rob the warehouse and possession of a pistol with intent to cause fear or violence.
The trial continues.
