Ruddington dog walkers 'stealing' dog poo bags

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
"Militant" dog walkers could be responsible for stealing large quantities of dog poo bags, according to a councillor.

Ruddington Parish Council faced some opposition when it decided to install dog poo bag dispensers around the Nottinghamshire village.
Now, some of the bags disappear almost as soon as they are restocked.
It is costing the council hundreds of pounds a year, so it has decided to remove some of the dispensers.
Nick Tegerdine, chairman of the council's environment and policy committee, said: "I really do worry what it is all about.
"There's a militant fringe of dog walkers in Ruddington who take the view that their dog can go wherever it likes and do whatever it likes, and I did get some opposition when we first proposed putting these dispensers in."
Other theories are that people are stealing them to use as nappy sacks, or taking dozens at a time and stockpiling them.
"What's happened is that certain dispensers are emptied systematically almost as soon as they are full," said the councillor.
"You're certainly barking if that's the attitude you take."
Like many areas, Ruddington has had an ongoing problem with dog poo not being cleaned up.
Last year, the council handed out chalk and asked residents to draw sad faces on the pavement next to dog mess to encourage owners to clean up.
