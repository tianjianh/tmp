The blaze took hold of the Royal Victoria Hospital building in Craigleith Road at about 16:20 on Monday.
Firefighters remain at the scene. There were no casualties.
The Royal Victoria Hospital was closed in 2012, but later temporarily reopened to deal with seasonal demand.
One witnesses said: "The fire raged all night."
Firefighters fought the blaze externally to bring it under control. They are now carrying out "damping down operations".
Nine fire appliances, one height vehicle and two water carriers were used at the scene.
The fire was reported by a significant number of people as smoke rose from the abandoned building.
