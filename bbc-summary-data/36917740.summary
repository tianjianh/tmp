The Premiership club will travel south to take on City, with Saints stressing there will be "no public access".
"It has come out of the blue through a contact of mine and we were, as you can imagine, delighted to accept the opportunity," said Wright.
"It will be a fantastic experience for the players."
Guardiola's City travelled to China to prepare for their Premier League season and beat Borussia Dortmund on penalties in Thursday's friendly.
However, Monday's planned meeting with Manchester United was called off after heavy rain in Beijing left the pitch unplayable.
Saints' domestic season has already started with Scottish League Cup first-round group fixtures, the fourth and final of which is against Stirling Albion on Saturday.
