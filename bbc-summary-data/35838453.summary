Doctor Claire Sheppey was rescued by firefighters from her burning second-floor flat on Crowland Terrace in Islington early on Wednesday morning but died later in hospital.
Dr Sheppey was a consultant paediatric anaesthetist at the Royal London Hospital in Whitechapel.
Tributes paid to her came from as far afield as New Zealand.
The 7 July attacks on a bus and three London underground trains killed 52 people and injured hundreds more in 2005.
Dr Sheppey was part of the Royal London Hospital's response team to the attacks.
Six fire engines and 35 firefighters from Islington and nearby stations tackled the blaze at her home on Wednesday morning for three hours before bringing it under control by 04:31 GMT.
A spokesman for the London Fire Brigade said: "A woman has sadly died following a fire in a house converted into flats on Crowland Terrace in Islington.
"Firefighters brought the woman out of a second-floor flat. She was taken to hospital by London Ambulance Service crews where she later died. The fire badly damaged the second-floor flat and also spread to the third floor and roof."
The cause of the fire is under investigation, the brigade added.
Doctor Jane McNeill, clinical director for perioperative medicine and consultant anaesthetist said Dr Sheppey was "a very valued colleague and important part of our department with a joie de vivre that will be so missed".
She added: "Personally I will miss a great colleague, but also a dear friend who enriched the lives of so many around her, with her tales of her travels across the world and a passion for life in general.
"She was an amazing woman and doctor."
