An image of the assassination of Russia's ambassador to Turkey, Andrei Karlov, has taken first prize in the 2017 World Press Photo awards.
Taken on 19 December 2016 at an art gallery in Ankara by Associated Press photographer Burhan Ozbilici, it shows gun-wielding off-duty Turkish policeman Mevlut Mert Altintas shouting, after fatally shooting the ambassador.
The jury chair, Stuart Franklin, praised Ozbilici's image. "I think it is an incredibly hard-hitting news photograph, great spot news story. It wasn't just a photograph, it was a spot news story and I think that Burhan was incredibly courageous and had extraordinary composure in being able to sort of calm himself down in the middle of the affray and take the commanding pictures that he took."
Ozbilici also triumphed in the Spot News, Stories, award for his series on the event, titled An Assassination in Turkey.
