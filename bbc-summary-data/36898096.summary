[SN]TITLE[SN]
Anthony Grainger police shooting inquiry to be 'open and fearless'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A public inquiry into the death of an unarmed man who was shot by police will be "open and fearless", Liverpool Crown Court has heard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Anthony Grainger, 36, of Bolton, was shot in the chest during a Greater Manchester Police (GMP) operation in Culceth, Cheshire in 2012.
Judge Thomas Teague QC said the inquiry would look at the police operation, the decision to send armed officers and any failures in gathering intelligence.
It will begin on 16 January next year.
The public inquiry was "not a trial", the court heard.
Judge Teague said he would ask the Attorney General to allow immunity for those giving evidence, so that "no evidence he or she gives to the inquiry will be used against them in criminal proceedings, or to start criminal proceedings".
The purpose of this was that witnesses did not "fear" giving any evidence to the inquiry,  he added.
The partner, brother, mother and stepfather of Mr Grainger, along with "GMP officer Q9" were named as  "core participants".
The judge said Mr Grainger's family had his "sympathy and condolences", adding that they will never be able to forget the way in which he died.
He said it was of the "utmost public concern" when an unarmed person was shot dead by police.
Judge Teague said some evidence may not be made available to the public, due to the "nature of the documentation".
A total of 370 witness statements had been taken so far, the court heard.
A preliminary hearing is due to be held on 14 November.
