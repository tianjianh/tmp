The 31-year-old has been out since February with a cruciate knee ligament injury but is close to full fitness.
After beginning his career at Tottenham he spent time on loan at Swindon, QPR, Gillingham and Norwich and joined Hull in 2006, before switching to the Clarets four years later.
"I'm over the moon to secure my future for the next couple of years," he said.
"I love it here. If it was for five years to stay here, then I would have signed that."
