£12,000 malt stolen in Blackford distillery raid

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A bottle of malt whisky worth £12,000 has been stolen in a raid on a Perth and Kinross distillery.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The rare malt was among seven bottles of whisky taken from Tullibardine Distillery's shop in Blackford at the weekend.
About £14,000 worth of whisky and two glasses were stolen from the shop during the break in.
Police want to trace a man seen walking with two bags near the A9 at Blackford at about 21:55 on Saturday.
He was described as between 25 and 35-years-old, of medium build, and was wearing a red top, light-coloured shorts and worker boots.
Police Scotland said the Stirling Street shop was broken into between 17:00 on Saturday and 09:25 on Sunday.
A typical branded whisky sold in a UK supermarket can cost about £14. Cheaper blends can be bought for less, a single malt would be about twice as much.
But, at the top end of the market, a rare bottle might fetch many thousands of pounds.
In some examples, luxury packaging (think crystal decanter, encrusted with jewels) makes up much of the cost.
In others, the rarity of the drink itself, from casks matured decades ago, pushes up the price tag.
The top prices in auction can match works of art. In 2010, an auction house in New York sold a decanter of whisky for $460,000 (£353,000).
