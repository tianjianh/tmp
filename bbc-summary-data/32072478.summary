Knightswood Park, in the city's north west, has been selected as the preferred location for the Â£2m track.
The announcement came as Glasgow and Berlin were named co-hosts of the first European Sports Championships in 2018.
The event, which includes the European Cycling Championships, will see more than 650 top cyclists compete in road, track, mountain bike and BMX championship events across Glasgow.
The new BMX track must be ready for summer 2018, although Glasgow City Council hopes to have it open before then.
Glasgow City Council leader Gordon Matheson said: "I'm delighted that we intend to bring an Olympic standard BMX track to Glasgow, a first for the city and for Scotland.
"BMX is a fast and entertaining sport and one which is gaining popularity in terms of participation and spectators and we want to take advantage of this by providing the facilities and opportunities to enjoy the sport and join in.
"This BMX track will be an excellent addition to our already world-class sporting facilities and a great resource for professional and aspiring athletes, schools, community groups alike."
