Northamptonshire Police tweeted live on Saturday night to show the problems in the county's town centres.
During the evening officers dealt with fights, drink-drivers and more than 100 999 calls after midnight.
The force said it hoped the tweets "highlighted the impact on the police".
Using the hashtag #alcoholharm, the force tweeted into the early hours about incidents in towns including Northampton, Daventry and Kettering.
Officers dealt with criminal damage, fights in the street, people assaulting nightclub and hotel staff and drink-drivers, including one man who was three times over the alcohol limit.
The force said since midnight its control room had received 187 calls, more than 100 of them via 999.
It added it dealt with 129 incidents in total, many of them drink-related.
After the night officers tweeted: "#alcoholharm is a social issue we all have a stake in solving.
"Hopefully tonight has highlighted the realities of dealing with drunkenness & the impact on the #police."
