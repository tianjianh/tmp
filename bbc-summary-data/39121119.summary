Newly crowned commonwealth flyweight champion Jay Harris believes his stablemate Liam Williams is leading a new boxing boom in Wales.

Williams faces former WBO super welterweight champion Liam Smith on Saturday, 8 April in Manchester.
"Liam Williams is flying the flag at the moment and kicking on all the Welsh fighters under Frank Warren with him," Harris told BBC Wales Sport.
"We are getting opportunities and TV time we wouldn't otherwise be getting."
Harris, who is managed by Gary Lockett, trains part-time with the likes of Liam Williams and Chris Jenkins in Lockett's stable when he is not working with his father, former British champion boxer Peter Harris.
And the Swansea boxer has no doubts Williams is heading for the big time.
"Him (Liam Williams) beating Liam Smith, which I am sure he will do, will take Welsh boxing onto another level again," he said.
"There are a lot of Welsh boxers coming through, it is booming at the moment. There is a lot of good Welsh talent coming through."
Harris is looking forward to gaining more experience after he won the Commonwealth flyweight title in just his tenth professional fight with a victory on points over Thomas Essomba at York Hall.
But he says winning his first title means even more coming from a family steeped in boxing heritage.
Father Peter was a British champion, uncle Mike was a Welsh champion and both professionals were trained by their father, himself a prodigious amateur talent.
"It was overwhelming (to win the title), brilliant, I have never had a feeling like that in my life, it was the best feeling in the world," he said.
"The family are over the moon, so proud, they were going crazy and my dad and uncle are chuffed to bits for me.
"Boxing has always been in my blood, my grandfather did it as well and trained my father and uncle and it has carried on with my father training me.
"He is always making sure I don't repeat any mistakes he made when he was younger."
