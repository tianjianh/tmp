Indian rail's plan to hire disabled people backfires

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Indian Railways' decision to be inclusive and hire more disabled people backfired on Thursday when candidates were called to sit for a test in a building with no lifts or ramps.

Some candidates were not able to reach the examination hall on the second and third floor of the building in Delhi.
The state-run transporter had arranged the test after the Supreme Court asked it to be more open to disabled people.
Railways Minister Suresh Prabhu has ordered an inquiry.
The Times of India reported that railway officials admitted to "some problems" at 10 of the 142 centres across the country.
Manish Bhardwaj, one of the candidates, told the paper that he had to drag himself to his allotted seat on the second floor of the building.
"The government wants us to beg. First, we have to fight the case till the Supreme Court to get vacancies in the disability quota filled. Then, we have to struggle to reach the examination centre," he said.
The rail network said that the candidates who faced difficulties would be allowed to reappear for the exam.
India is not known for being friendly towards the disabled and most public places still lack basic facilities to help them in everyday life.
