The left-back was caught in the mouth by Aberdeen striker Jayden Stockley during the first half of the 2-1 triumph at Hampden Park.
Tierney, 19, is in the Scotland squad for the home 2018 World Cup qualifier against England on 10 June.
He has indicated on social media that the win had been "worth a broken jaw".
"I think he needs an operation," Celtic boss Brendan Rodgers told BBC Scotland. "It wasn't nice, and I'll have to speak to the medics on that."
Stockley's left arm connected with Tierney as the pair turned in pursuit of an aerial clearance and the defender was replaced by Tom Rogic, who would score Celtic's winner in stoppage time.
"I'll have to see [the challenge] again," Rodgers said. "There's two challenges he's had on Kieran - there was one up at Aberdeen which was questionable.
"I'll have a look at this one, and take it from there."
Rodgers' Aberdeen counterpart Derek McInnes believes his player did not intentionally make contact with Tierney.
"Nobody even appealed for a foul," McInnes said. "Kieran Tierney is an honest boy, he's a brilliant boy how he plays the game and I think he's got his eye on the ball and just ran into Jayden.
"Jayden was under strict orders not to be flaying elbows or whatever. I think it is just an unfortunate accident. I don't think there's a foul there and not many Celtic players appealed for that either."
