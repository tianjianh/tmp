Isla Wiggin, from Fleet in Hampshire, died in a collision on the A34 in Hinksey Hill, Oxfordshire, on 25 August.
Her unborn brother also died as a result of the collision.
Isla's family issued a statement saying she was "a loving and caring" daughter who "would have made an amazing big sister".
A lorry and seven cars were involved in the accident, which closed the northbound carriageway for almost 10 hours.
The family statement said: "Isla was as perfect a daughter as you could ever wish for. Beautiful and witty, yet cheeky and mischievous, she was a character that you couldn't help but love with all your heart.
"Isla put her heart and soul into everything and all of her friends were 'best friends' who she adored. She and her mummy were like two peas in a pod who did everything together, she even loved to help out around the house.
"Her loving and caring nature would have made her an amazing big sister and she was so excited at the prospect.
"Although adamant that the baby was a girl, Isla said she'd like to call the baby Harry if it was a boy, so it seemed only right to do so.
"We were extremely proud to find out that we were going to have a son, who would have completed our family. He had big hands and strong arms and no doubt would've grown into a strapping young man who would have loved and protected Isla.
"We are so sorry that we didn't get the chance to meet him properly and get to know him.
"We are very grateful for all of the love and support we have received over the last week. Although nothing can ever make up for the heartache that we feel, it is comforting to know that our beautiful children never witnessed any evil in the world.
"Not a day will go by where we won't think of them and all the happy memories that we have shared."
A 58-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of causing serious injury by dangerous driving and released on bail until 2 October.
