QPR: Championship club's Financial Fair Play sanction set for resolution

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Queens Park Rangers' three-year battle with the English Football League over their Financial Fair Play sanction is due to be resolved next month.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
An arbitration panel will determine if the EFL were within their rights to lodge a heavy fine against the London club for exceeding spending limits.
The EFL have never said what fine they planned to impose after QPR's promotion to the Premier League in 2014.
However, it was anticipated at the time it could be as much as £58m.
QPR were limited to making losses of £8m for the season in question. Their actual loss was £9.8m, but owner Tony Fernandes and other shareholders also wrote off £60m in loans as an "exceptional item".
The Loftus Road club were relegated back into the Championship after one season.
