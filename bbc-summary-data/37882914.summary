Bournemouth Borough Council said there had been several collisions on the eastbound exit slip road from Richmond Hill roundabout on to the A338 Wessex Way in the last five years.
The trial will provide vehicles using the slip road with a dedicated lane by closing the carriageway's inside lane.
The change will be made on a temporary basis for three months.
Work to install traffic management took place overnight.
A decision on whether to make the change permanent will be taken at the end of the trial.
Highway Design and Road Safety Manager Richard Pearson said: "I am confident that this trial will significantly reduce the risk to drivers using the slip road.
"However, it is important to properly evaluate the impact on traffic flow on this key strategic route before we confirm the change."
