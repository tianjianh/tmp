League One club Oldham Athletic have appointed Motherwell and Northern Ireland assistant manager Stephen Robinson as their new manager.

Robinson, 41, has been working at Euro 2016 as Michael O'Neill's number two.
The Latics have been looking for a new manager since the departure of John Sheridan, who left to take over at Notts County.
"When I came down, I felt like this was the right club. I really like what the owner said to me," Robinson said.
"He sold me his ideas and ambitions and I had demands of my own. He has been really good with that and it's an exciting time for the football club.
"I'm more than ready for this job. It's a club that has massive tradition and I want to get an identity back to the club."
Robinson is set to appoint Ian Baraclough as his assistant after they worked together when Baraclough was manager of Motherwell between December 2014 and September 2015.
Last week, Oldham added former Bournemouth and Nottingham Forest boss Sean O'Driscoll to the coaching staff and gave him a role in helping the board appoint a new manager.
Steve Evans, most recently of Leeds United, rejected the offer to manage Oldham despite agreeing personal terms.
