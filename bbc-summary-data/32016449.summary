The Griffin family is moving home - to ITV2.

The channel's signed a deal with 20th Century Fox to show new episodes of Family Guy from later this year.
The agreement also includes other Seth MacFarlane animated comedies American Dad, The Cleveland Show and new series Bordertown.
Family Guy has been a major part of the BBC Three schedule since 2006, becoming one of the channel's highest rating shows.
But it's not the last we'll see of the Griffins on the BBC as the corporation has one more new series to show - the one currently being broadcast in the States.
The BBC also still has rights to repeat episodes from previous series - for the moment.
The BBC says Family Guy will be on the BBC for "at least the next two years".
There's been discussion over what would happen to the offbeat comedy, given plans to move BBC Three online.
More than 270,000 people have signed a petition against the move.
The BBC said: "We are incredibly proud that the BBC has successfully aired Family Guy for the past nine years and built the series into such a hit in the UK.
"However, when a show becomes so successful it often becomes a target for other broadcasters.
"We are sorry that it will not have a long term home on the BBC."
