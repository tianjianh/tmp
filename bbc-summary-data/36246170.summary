Jeanine Christelle Djomnang, 26, became ill before a Femina Stars Ebolowa match in southern Cameroon on Sunday, and died on her way to hospital.
The federation says initial reports suggest she died of a heart attack but it is now awaiting a medical report.
It comes days after Cameroon player Patrick Ekeng died in Romania.
Djomnang complained of chest pains as she prepared to take on Louves MINPROFF Yaounde in the Cameroon elite league and was taken to hospital.
Cameroon's African Women Footballer of the Year Gaelle Enganamouit, who now plays in Sweden, was one of the first to react to the news.
"It's with sadness that I have learnt of the death of my team-mate Djomnang Jeanine Christelle of Femina Stars Ebolowa, may her soul rest in peace," she wrote on social media.
On Friday, it was confirmed that Dinamo Bucharest and Cameroon midfielder Patrick Ekeng had died aged 26 of a suspected heart attack after collapsing on the pitch.
The 26-year-old fell to the floor in the 70th minute of a televised Romanian league match between Dinamo and Viitorul. He died later in hospital.
A book of condolence has been opened at the Cameroon Football Federation headquarters for both Ekeng and Djomanang.
