Port Vale 3-0 Crewe Alexandra

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Crewe Alexandra's four-season stay in League One was ended by their local rivals as Port Vale sentenced them to relegation.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Louis Dodds scored both goals as Vale's victory confirmed their neighbours' return to League Two.
Dodds hit the opener in only the third minute before sealing victory seven minutes from time.
JJ Hooper then curled a superb third for Vale in injury time to relegate Crewe with still five games remaining.
Having flirted with relegation for the past two seasons, the Alex have struggled particularly over the second half of the season.
This was a sixth straight defeat for Steve Davis's side, who have now won just once since late November - and only six times all season.
The Valiants got off to a flier, when Crewe failed to clear Michael O'Connor's left-wing corner and Dodds pounced to drive in a low left-foot shot off the post from 14 yards.
Crewe improved after making a double substitution at half-time, but Vale wrapped up the points with Dodds' second goal when he smashed into an empty net after Hooper's shot had been saved by Alex keeper Ben Garratt.
Hooper then received a pass from Michael Brown to curl in Vale's third with a terrific right-foot shot from 16 yards which flew inside the stranded Garratt's left-hand post.
Port Vale manager Rob Page told BBC Radio Stoke:
"it was an excellent performance, as it was a difficult test for us in many aspects. I know Crewe are rock bottom and they have gone down today but he made changes.
"Every time they play against us he changes it and goes more physical, and sort of goes away from what he normally does where they get the ball down and play.
"So, we knew we had to match that. We got off to the best start and that's what I asked them to do. Start fast come out of the traps and get an early goal. We certainly did that.
Crewe manager Steve Davis told BBC Radio Stoke:
"It's a sad day for the football club, but we've not gone down because of today. It's because of what has happened over the course of the season. We've not been able to win enough games.
"I've been talking to the players about what we can learn, tried to be diplomatic with them and realise what it means.
"We're disappointed that we've not taken it to the death like we have before. We all share the emotions of being relegated. It's not a nice feeling. It hurts just as much as a manager as it did as a player."
