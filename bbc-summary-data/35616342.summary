[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Non-urgent patients have been told they face longer waits at a Cardiff hospital this weekend.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
University Hospital of Wales said a high number of seriously-ill patients were admitted through the week, putting services under pressure.
Doctors will prioritise these cases, resulting in longer waits for others.
Alice Casey, from Cardiff and Vale University Health Board, asked people to "think carefully" if they needed to go to the emergency unit.
The health board said there were 5,310 visits to the emergency unit in January, up 13% on the previous year.
On Friday, patients were told to stay away from Bronglais Hospital in Aberystwyth, Ceredigion, after several patients fell ill with symptoms associated with the norovirus.
