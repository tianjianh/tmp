Thirty-six puppies found in Dublin by police on Tuesday were being sent to the UK from puppy farms in the Republic of Ireland, it is believed.

The puppies, including cocker and springer spaniels, Labradors and Jack Russell terriers, were recovered in two cars on Malahide Road.
Animal welfare officers said they suspected the animals, which were found in boxes, were being trafficked for sale in the UK.
Two men were arrested at the scene.
Officers from the Dublin Society for Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (DSPCA) took the puppies into quarantine and secure accommodation following their discovery.
Some of the puppies are suffering from a number of treatable conditions including mange, ear mites, fleas, eye infections and parasitic infections.
"They are doing very well today compared to the condition they were found in," said DSPCA spokesperson Gillian Bird.
"We don't believe they were puppies for the Christmas market as it's too early. This is an example of animal trafficking which can happen at any time of the year.
"Several of the puppies are receiving special care as they were too young to be removed from their mothers."
Many of the pups had had their tails docked and their dew claws removed and are receiving treatment for minor infections.
The DSPCA has confirmed that none of the puppies are available for new homes until DSPCA inspectors have concluded their investigations.
"When the dogs are ready to go to new homes, we will put it up on our website and our Facebook page" said Ms Bird.
