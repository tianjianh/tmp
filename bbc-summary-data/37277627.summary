Kevin Kerger gave the visitors a shock first half lead.
Luxembourg could have extended their lead from the penalty spot but Billy O'Brien denied Ricardo Pinto after Tom Lockyer had handled the ball.
Gethin Jones hit the crossbar before Charles' injury time equaliser.
Charles bundled home from close range from Harry Wilson's cornet to spare Wales' blushes on a frustrating evening for Geraint Williams' side who cannot now qualify for next summer's finals in Poland.
Wales' hopes of automatic qualification were ended by their 4-0 defeat to Denmark in Wrexham the previous Friday.
