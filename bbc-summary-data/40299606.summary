The new singing programme, Pitch Battle, started last night and we want to know what you thought about it!

The first episode featured six singing groups competing against each other for a place in the final.
Leeds Contemporary Singers became the first group to reach the final.
Mel Giedroyc was back on our screens presenting the show, after leaving the Great British Bake Off.
