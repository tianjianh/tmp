The 16-year-old, from Manchester, had previously admitted two terror offences including possessing "recipes for explosives" and a bomb-making guide.
She was first detained by anti-terror police in April.
At Manchester Youth Court she was given a 12-month referral order with youth offending teams to address her radicalisation.
The court heard she had intended to hack into the White House and became obsessed with suicide bombings after becoming radicalised online.
Sitting in court, flanked by her mother and an aunt, she told the judge: "I deeply regret what I have done. I wish to make changes if I get the chance to prove I am not a terrorist."
Passing sentence, District Judge Khalid Qureshi said: "It must be every parent's worst nightmare to discover their child has been accessing material they should not, of whatever type."
The girl had used her school's IT system to search for information on the so-called Islamic State (IS) group, the IS militant known as "Jihadi John", and images of Michael Adebolajo, who killed Fusilier Lee Rigby in Woolwich in 2013.
Analysis of her mobile phone found instructions for producing a timed circuit, a document about bomb-making and the Anarchist Cookbook 2000.
She was detained by anti-terror police in April along with a 14-year-old boy, who admitted involvement in a plot to attack police in Australia.
The boy, now 15, was jailed for life at the Old Bailey after pleading guilty to inciting terrorism abroad.
Phone data retrieved by police showed the pair exchanged more than 2,000 WhatsApp messages a day before they were arrested.
The girl, who cannot be named, pleaded guilty at an earlier hearing to two offences under section 58 of the Terrorism Act 2000, of possessing documents likely to be of use to anyone preparing or committing an act of terrorism.
No evidence was found that she was aware of the Anzac Day plot or any plan to harm others or incite terrorism in the UK or elsewhere, the court heard.
