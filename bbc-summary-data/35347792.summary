The jump jockey made headlines last year with his return to the saddle, two years after sustaining life-threatening injuries in a fall at Perth.
Toomey, 26, has not ridden a winner since his comeback in July, but will continue riding in the short term alongside his training duties.
Newland won the Grand National at Aintree with Pineau De Re in 2014.
Toomey was given a 3% chance of survival by doctors after a horrific fall from Solway Dandy in 2013. He was reported to have died for six seconds before being resuscitated by paramedics.
A large section of his skull was removed as his brain swelled in an induced coma and he spent 157 days in hospital before being released.
Previously based with Phil Kirby in North Yorkshire, Toomey will join the Newland team in Worcester on 1 February. He has been riding for the David Pipe stable since August,
"I had hoped to get going a bit more but it's been hard," said Toomey. "I'm starting off as assistant trainer there and will remain riding for a bit longer.
"He doesn't have many horses but what he does have are decent."
