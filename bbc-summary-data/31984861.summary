A pub sign commemorating the work of fantasy author Sir Terry Pratchett has been unveiled in Somerset.

The creator of the Discworld series died on 12 March following a public struggle with Alzheimer's disease.
The sign on Uncle Tom's Cabin, in Wincanton, was created by Discworld Emporium illustrator Richard Kingston.
Landlord Antony Yateman, who commissioned the sign before the author's death, said: "I was hoping that Sir Terry would unveil it."
Wincanton was "twinned" with the fictional Discworld city of Ankh-Morpork in 2002.
The sign references Ankh-Morpork's most famous watering hole, the Mended Drum.
"Both men were regulars. They used to come here after creative meetings at the Discworld Emporium a few doors down the street," said Mr Yateman.
"I commissioned the new sign, and was hoping that Sir Terry would unveil it himself. Sadly he died, but the sign is now up and serves as a memorial to a great author and character."
