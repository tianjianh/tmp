Chris and Colin Weir, from Largs in North Ayrshire, won Â£161m when their numbers came up on 12 July last year.
The pair have already given large donations to several causes, including Â£1m to the SNP's independence campaign.
Speaking as they celebrated the anniversary of their win, they said it was a "privilege" to be able to support causes close their heart.
Mr Weir said: "It has been quite a year, exciting and challenging in equal measure, but we couldn't be happier.
"There is still an overwhelming sense of good fortune - we were incredibly lucky and will never forget that.
"But, a year on, the biggest change in our life is that we can now support causes close to our hearts in a more meaningful way.
"It is a privilege to be in a position to see a situation where help is needed and be able to do something about it."
The couple helped raise funds for local 15-year-old tennis hopeful Ross Wilson to attend a tennis academy in Barcelona and 15-year-old race driver Gregor Ramsay to attend the European and Italian F3 European Abarth.
They have also donated money to help refurbish sports facilities for the National Sports Training Centre Inverclyde and the Largs Thistle Community Club, and helped secure the future of the Waverley, the world's last ocean-going paddle steamer.
Mr Weir added: "What we've done in the last 12 months is to achieve a balance between enjoying our new life to the full with recognising the real difference we can now make to others' lives.
"We are currently in the process of setting up our charitable trust, which will support individuals, groups and charities across Scotland who are struggling to gain funds from the more traditional or mainstream grant makers.
"For us, that seems the best way for us to go on sharing our good luck."
