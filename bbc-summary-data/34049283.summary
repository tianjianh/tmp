The Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) said vintage jets would not be allowed to perform "high-energy aerobatics" over land until further notice.
At least 11 people died when a Hawker Hunter crashed into traffic on the A27 in West Sussex on Saturday.
CarFest North was hit by tragedy when a pilot died in Cheshire on 1 August.
Kevin Whyman, 39, was killed when his Folland Gnat aircraft crashed during an aerial display at Oulton Park.
The Air Accidents Investigation Branch is carrying out an investigation.
In a statement, the CarFest South organisers said the decision had been taken as both a mark of respect and in consideration of the CAA's airshow review.
"We send our heartfelt condolences to all of those affected by the terrible incident on Saturday," they said.
"We hope to hold future air events at future festivals and would like to offer our support and good wishes to the air display community."
The event in Hampshire takes place at Laverstoke Park Farm from 28 to 30 August.
A flypast by the Gnat Display team honouring Mr Whyman will still go ahead on Saturday afternoon and will be accompanied by a minute's silence.
Mr Evans, a car enthusiast who has recently been named as the new presenter of BBC Top Gear, created the motoring and music festival which raises money for BBC Children in Need.
Displays that were set to take place at CarFest South included Abarth Extra 300, Huey, The Old Buckers and Night Flight Pyros.
