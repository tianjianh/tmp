[SN]TITLE[SN]
Dangerous prisoner centre living conditions assessed

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Prison units that hold the most dangerous inmates are managed with "impressive care and humanity" - but living conditions need improving, the chief inspector of prisons has said.

Nick Hardwick visited close supervision centres, which hold about 60 men in eight prisons in England and Wales.
He said the system was "basically well run", but also found prisoners could barely see daylight from cells and exercised in yards resembling "cages".
Bosses said improvements would be made.
Mr Hardwick praised staff for their care of the men, which he described as "impressive" considering how difficult the prisoners held in such centres were.
But as part of the inspection focusing on living conditions, it was found that prisoners could see no unobstructed daylight from their cells.
One prisoner described his unit as "like a submarine".
Close supervision centres (CSC) hold the most dangerous inmates in the prison system - many of whom have committed further, very serious offences in prison. They are sometimes referred to as a "prison within a prison".
The system was set up in 1998 and deals with prisoners subject to prison rule 46, which allows them to be detained away from other inmates because of the risk they pose.
Her Majesty's Inspector of Prisons describes the system as "extreme custody" whose management raises "complex operational challenges and profound ethical issues".
The centres have capacity for 60 men, and a further 14 in similar but slightly less restrictive conditions, and are by a centralised team within the prison service.
Prisoners are held in designated CSC cells or segregation units within larger prisons, such as Belmarsh and Full Sutton, and are highly supervised.

Mr Hardwick said the exercise yards - with grilles overhead - were "grim, dehumanising" and "unacceptably oppressive". Some prisoners were only allowed to talk to visiting relatives through a barred window.
Last November one prisoner attacked another, causing an acute brain injury and a three-month stay in hospital.
But Mr Hardwick said that, overall, violence in close supervision centres was low.
He said staff leadership of the system as a whole was "clear, principled and courageous", but expressed concern about the mental health of the prisoners, because of the tightly-controlled conditions they were kept in.
"Given the restricted nature of the regimes offered and most men's inability to move out of the units, more needed to be done to offset the real potential for psychological deterioration by the more imaginative provision of both in and out of cell activities," the report, by Her Majesty's Inspector of Prisons, urged.
"The reasons why a disproportionate number of black and minority ethnic and Muslim men were held in the system needed to be better understood, and action taken to address any identified issues of unfairness."
Michael Spurr, chief executive of the MoJ's National Offender Management Service, said the inspectorate had concluded the close supervision centres were well-run.
"I echo his praise for the courage and professionalism of staff who work every day with exceptionally dangerous individuals," he said.
"Managing such prisoners humanely and safely whilst providing opportunities for progression is a complex and difficult task. We will use the recommendations in the report to make further improvements in the system but staff can be extremely proud of the work they do."
