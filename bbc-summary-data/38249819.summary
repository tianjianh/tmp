Bradley Lowery, from Blackhall Colliery, near Hartlepool, was cheered by Sunderland fans when he appeared as a mascot for the team in September.
Opponents Everton pledged £200,000 towards his appeal fund.
His mother, Gemma, has revealed his cancer has grown and treatment would only give him more time.
Bradley was diagnosed with neuroblastoma in 2013, and underwent two years of "gruelling" chemotherapy.
It went into remission but returned in an aggressive form in June, and his only hope lay in antibody treatment in New York.
The family had hit the target, but his mother has now posted on Facebook; "I'm devastated to let you know that his cancer has continued to grow.
"We have had a meeting with Bradley's consultant and he has given us three options but... they all have the same outcome and that is Bradley will lose his fight.
"I honestly have no words to say how heartbroken I am right now.
"I really don't know how I'm going to make a decision either to take my baby home and have a couple of months with him or put him through more gruelling treatment that could leave him fighting for his life and to have the same outcome."
On hearing the news Sunderland AFC tweeted: "Keep fighting, Bradley!"
