Wolves head coach Paul Lambert says winger Ivan Cavaleiro will be unavailable for "a few weeks" after he suffered a knee injury.

Cavaleiro became Wolves' record signing when he joined from Monaco for a reported Â£7m fee in August.
The 23-year-old has made 22 league appearances for the Championship side, but has started in only 12 games.
Wolves are 18th in the Championship table, seven points above the relegation zone.
