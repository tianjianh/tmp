Rotherham United sealed their Championship status for another season as Wolves were held to a fourth successive goalless draw at home.

Dave Edwards shot wastefully wide for Wolves early on after getting on the end of a cut-back pass from Joe Mason.
Danny Batth had a header tipped onto the bar by Millers keeper Lee Camp, who rushed out to deny Mason in what was the hosts' best chance after the break.
Neil Warnock's Millers held on to extend their unbeaten run to 11 games.
Rotherham have lost just twice in 14 games since the much-travelled Warnock took charge in February, when the Millers were three points adrift of safety.
Even without their away point, Rotherham would have been safe as MK Dons were relegated to League One following a 4-1 home defeat by Brentford.
Wolves remain 14th in the table, having now gone goalless at Molineux since Matt Doherty's injury-time winner beat Bristol City 2-1 on 8 March.
Wolves head coach Kenny Jackett:
"Ultimately there is some frustration because we have drawn four games on the trot at home 0-0 and it is not a record we want. But it's better than losing games.
"We played some good football, particularly through James Henry, who was our best player and had lots of freedom.
"We had clear-cut chances but ultimately you need to put those chances away and we didn't.
"We have to keep looking to find the right mix and the winning equation, which is what we are looking for."
Rotherham United manager Neil Warnock:
"It will take a while to realise what an achievement that is.
"The players have been fantastic and the chairman has been unbelievable and it's wonderful for me to give them something to smile about because they have worked ever so hard to get Rotherham in the Championship.
"I am speaking to the chairman in the next couple of weeks. I said once we're safe we'll have a chat, I will be in the Championship next year, I am speaking to him so we will just have to see how it develops.
"It's great to come here and get it put to bed. If you'd have told me that at the start I'd have snapped your hands off. Now I want to finish as high as I can."
