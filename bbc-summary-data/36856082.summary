Dundee United FC said Mr Donnelly was a "hugely important figure in covering football in Dundee over many decades."
He made 107 appearances as a goalkeeper for East Fife between 1960 and 1964 and also played for Brechin City and Arbroath.
He began his journalism career working for the People's Journal and Sunday Express in the late 1960s.
A highly-respected figure among fellow journalists and football fans, Mr Donnelly spent the following decades covering football matches across Tayside for newspapers and radio.
Former BBC Scotland sports presenter Jim Spence said: "He was just a really well-liked guy and synonymous with football in this area.
"Dick had a great radio voice, it captured the mood, it was one of those great voices that dragged you in, really strong, gravelly and authoritative.
"I doubt if there was anyone in Scottish football that Dick Donnelly couldn't pick a phone up to.
"He was an old-school journalist in the best possible way."
A statement on Dundee United's website read:  "Everyone at Tannadice is very saddened to hear of the passing of broadcaster and reporter Dick Donnelly.
"Dick was a hugely important figure in covering football in Dundee over many decades who attended all the major games involving United, both at home and in Europe, and was always entertaining and fair in his reporting.
"His voice was instantly recognisable on radio broadcasts. Scottish football journalism is a poorer place for his passing.
"Dundee United sends deepest condolences to his family."
