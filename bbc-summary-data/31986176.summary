[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
League Two side Morecambe sign Liverpool goalkeeper Danny Ward and Shrewsbury midfielder Aaron Wildig on one-month loan deals.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Ward, 21, moved to Anfield from Wrexham but is yet to make an appearance for the Reds, although he has been on the bench 19 times.
The Wales Under-21 international will become the Shrimps' sixth goalkeeper of the season if he makes an appearance.
Ex-Cardiff man Wildig, 22, has featured just once for the Shrews this season.
He spent a month on loan at Conference side Kidderminster in January, making four appearances.
Both players are available for Morecambe's game against Carlisle on Saturday.
