Indian troops have killed three suspected militants who tried to attack an army base in Indian-administered Kashmir, authorities say.

The police said the militants were shot dead after a heavy gun battle near the base in Kupwara district.
The fighting comes after an attack on another base killed 18 soldiers last month. India blamed the attack on Pakistan, which denied the claim.

Police Superintendent Ghulam Jeelani told the AFP news agency that the attackers clashed with Indian soldiers near the base.
The nuclear-armed neighbours have accused each other of increasing hostilities along their de-facto border in Kashmir since last month's attack.
Last week, India said it had retaliated by carrying out "surgical strikes" against suspected militants along the de-facto border.
Pakistan denied that India had carried out any strikes and said two of its soldiers were killed in unprovoked cross-border shelling.
