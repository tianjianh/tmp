Turners Hill Natural burial ground plans refused

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Plans for a natural burial ground on agricultural land in West Sussex have been turned down after objections from a parish council.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Councillors refused the application for land off Turners Hill Road despite a recommendation by Mid Sussex council officers that it should be granted.
Turners Hill Parish Council chairwoman Thelma Mason said the site was next to Tulley's Farm entertainment complex.
"It wasn't the ideal position for people in mourning," she said.
The parish council and other objectors also complained about the repositioning of an ancient hedgerow and possible contamination of surface water flowing into the River Medway.
The council received five letters of support welcoming the plans as a sustainable asset to the community, which addressed a shortage of burial facilities.
