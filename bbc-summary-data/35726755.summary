Calls have been made for a secret report on police corruption to be published on the anniversary of the murder of Welsh private eye Daniel Morgan.

It is 29 years since the killing, and claims police corruption prevented a conviction have been investigated.
Labour MP Paul Flynn said the Tiberius report proved the depth of the problem in London.
The Metropolitan Police said it was keeping it secret to "protect life".
Daniel Morgan, 37, from Cwmbran, Torfaen, was found with an axe in his head in a pub car park in Sydenham, South London, on 10 March 1987.
The Newport West MP tweeted calling for the secret report to be published "on the anniversary of Daniel Morgan's brutal murder to prove [the] scale of police corruption".
The report claims more than 40 serving officers were working with eight crime syndicates to help them evade justice for crimes including murder and drug trafficking.
Mr Flynn said he saw the report last year "under very strict surveillance" when he was a member of the Home Affairs Select Committee.
In an early day motion in parliament, he said it "reveals the astonishing breadth and depth of police corruption among the London police".
"It's an amazing document," he said.
"It sounds like Chicago in the 1920s, not like Dixon of Dock Green's police that we know and love."
He added: "Everyone should realise the scale of the problem."
A spokeswoman for the Metropolitan Police said: "By its very nature it is a secret document that details the threat of corruption to police employees posed by serious and organised criminals.
"The passage of time does nothing to reduce the very real risks to anti-corruption tactics, intelligence sources or current operations. This is not about refusing to be transparent but protecting life."
