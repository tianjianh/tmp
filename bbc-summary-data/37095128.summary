Shrewsbury Fields Forever festival cancelled

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
"Shropshire's largest music festival" has been cancelled a month before it was due to go ahead after the firm behind it ceased trading.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Shrewsbury Fields Forever Festival was due to take place at The Quarry with headliners Dizzee Rascal and the Happy Mondays performing.
However, last week the town council refused permission for the event to be staged.
Organiser Forever Invasion Ltd said it would go into voluntary liquidation.
Insolvency firm Irwin UK said it did not know the exact number of tickets that had been sold but understood it to be "several hundred".
Forever Invasion director, Dene Edwards, said the insolvency firm had been hired to contact creditors including ticket holders.
He also advised ticket holders to contact their card holders to see if they could get refunds.
He said he would be contacting the town council to get more detail on the reasons for its decision.
The council had said that "insufficient information was available to confirm the booking."

The event had already been postponed from the year before as organisers said they could not find a venue.
Councillor Jon Tandy said: "Our focus has always been to ensure quality events which are safe for those who attend, that show good value for money and that leave those event-goers feeling they have had a good time.
"To do that we require good event planning. In this case I am afraid we couldn't be assured that those values could be achieved."
Forever Invasion Ltd is also the company behind the Shrewsbury International Comic Art Festival which went ahead in July.
