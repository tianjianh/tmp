Press reports said the girl, Daniela Mora, had been abducted by a criminal gang.
The government had offered a large reward for information and President Juan Manuel Santos said the security forces were pursuing the men who had taken her.
Daniela was kidnapped on Thursday as she was being driven out of school.
She is the daughter of Diego Mora,  director of the National Protection Unit of Colombia.
The unit is responsible for providing protection for people who are considered to be at risk.
A reward of $60,000 had been offered for information about her whereabouts.
The kidnapping took place in the northern city of Cucuta, on the border with Venezuela.
The girl was taken by a group of unknown men as she was being driven out of her school in a bulletproof car.
This sort of high profile kidnapping has become unusual in recent years, says the BBC's Natalio Cosoy.
