Premier League predictions: Lawro v Dad's Army stars

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
BBC Sport's football expert Mark Lawrenson is pitting his wits against a different guest each week this season.

Lawro's opponents for the latest round of Premier League games are Blake Harrison and Daniel Mays, stars of the new Dad's Army film.

Harrison, who plays Private Pike, is a Millwall fan who told BBC Sport: "I grew up about 10 minutes away from the old Den and then they moved to the New Den which, equally, is about 10 minutes away from where I grew up.
"My whole family supported them so I was a fan from birth. But then my younger brother just decided he was a Liverpool fan - until then I did not realise I had any choice in the matter."
Mays, who plays Private Walker, supports Leyton Orient and says his stand-out memory of following the O's is from the FA Cup rather than the "ups and downs" of lower-league football.
He explained: "It was against Arsenal in the FA Cup third round in 2011. We were sitting right next to their fans and one of them clocked me from the telly, and was giving it to me all game, lots of banter shouting things along the lines of 'you're a terrible actor'.
"Then we equalised in stoppage time and it was just the most sensational goal to celebrate, but I did not care about that, I was just giving it back to him."
You can see more from Harrison and Mays on Football Focus at 12:10 GMT on Saturday on BBC One and the BBC Sport website
Our scoring system has changed this season and a correct result (picking a win, draw or defeat) is now worth 10 points. The exact score earns 40 points.
The midweek Premier League games saw Lawro get four correct results from 10 matches, including one perfect score.
His score of 70 points saw him beat Maccabees guitarist Felix White, who picked five correct results but with no perfect scores for a total of 50 points.

Match report
Some Arsenal fans were complaining after their draw with Southampton on Tuesday but they actually had enough chances to win two games.

Part of their problem was that everyone around them at the top of the table won. The mood would have been very different if Arsenal had got the goal they probably should have scored, and if Sunderland's pressure had seen them equalise against Manchester City.
I expect the Gunners to bounce back and this is a good game for them to do that in because Bournemouth are an open side who play attacking football.
The Cherries always create chances but they will let Arsenal play.
Lawro's prediction: 0-2
Dad's Army prediction: (Harrison) Arsenal are going to smash it. 0-4
Match preview
Whatever the Dutch is for bus*, I think Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal will park it at Stamford Bridge on Sunday because this is a game he will not want to lose.
Chelsea seem to find it hard to break down teams who make it difficult for them, and United will definitely look to do that.
Eden Hazard will start, which will make a difference, and the Blues will continue to climb up the table, but this game has got a draw written all over it.
*It's bus, Lawro
Lawro's prediction: 1-1
Dad's Army prediction: 1-0
