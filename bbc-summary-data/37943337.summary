A draw against England would be a good result - Darren Fletcher

Scotland captain Darren Fletcher says Friday's World Cup qualifier against England is not a "must-win" game.

After a draw with Lithuania and defeat by Slovakia, the Scots can ill-afford a loss at Wembley, but Fletcher believes a draw would be a good result.
"Even with a couple of disappointing results, we are by no means out of it. We can't be get drawn into these "must win" games.
"A point would be a decent result for us," Fletcher said.
"We are [not] playing for a draw [but] if we can get a result, we are still involved in the group with big games coming up in 2017."
Fletcher says the prospect of facing their oldest rivals will give Scotland added motivation going into the Group F clash.
"It doesn't get much bigger than this - there will be a little more fire in the belly, it being England v Scotland," the West Brom midfielder explained.
"Every time you lead your country out it is important but there is no bigger stage than Wembley in front of 90,000 fans.
"We went out to the stadium and had a look around. It's a great excitement. It will be a great occasion and hopefully we can get the result to remember it by."

Fletcher will lead the team out at Wembley - if selected - despite the return from a brief international retirement of Celtic midfielder Scott Brown.
He welcomed the personal and playing qualities that his fellow midfielder adds to the squad now that he is back, and admitted the prospect of such a significant competitive fixture against old rivals England is inspiring.
Fletcher warned, though, that the passion of the Scottish players and fans will be matched by their opponents, who will be expected to prevail at Wembley - where they haven't lost a competitive game since 2007.
"It will be a bit of a derby game," Fletcher said. "It is a big game for England as well, let's not forget.
"They are at home, they are under pressure to perform in front of their own fans. Wembley is not the easiest place to play when there is expectancy on you, especially with 90,000 people there.
"It will be difficult for them but the passion will not call come from the Scotland side, English players have plenty passion. I [saw] that at Celtic Park in the friendly [in 2014], they came out all guns blazing, it meant so much to them, [and] that was a friendly match.
"Every time you represent your country and lead your country out it is massive there is no bigger place to do it as a Scotsman, to walk out at Wembley in front of 90,000 fans and 10 teammates behind you, desperate to get a result and create a bit of history. It is a monumental moment and one I am relishing.
"We are not going in here with fear or on a real low, we get disappointed after results but it gives you a bit of steel and determination to go out there and try to put it right.
"It is an occasion I am going to try to enjoy. I looked around the stadium and it is exciting, a great arena to play football in. I am sure there will be many more than 14,000 fellow Scotsman cheering us on and hopefully we can get the result we can remember it by."
