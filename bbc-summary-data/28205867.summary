A man and woman have been remanded in custody charged with murdering a man whose body was found in a wheelie bin.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Police said "frail and vulnerable" Lurgan man Owen Creaney, 40, died after a "serious and sustained attack".
Stephen Hughes, 27, of Moyraverty Court, Craigavon, and Shauneen Boyle, 23, of Edenderry Park, Banbridge, appeared in court on Tuesday.
The court heard that, during police interviews, each claimed the other was responsible for the killing.
The attack happened on Wednesday night, but his body was not found until Saturday evening.
The bin containing Mr Creaney's body was found at the porch of Mr Hughes' home.
A detective told the court that officers had initially failed to find Mr Creaney's body after receiving a tip-off on Saturday around lunchtime.
Police later returned and looked in the bin after being given information by Ms Boyle, the detective said.
The judge refused bail, and both were remanded in custody to appear in court again later this month.
