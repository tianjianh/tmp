Roseann Mallon inquest hears closing submissions

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Closing submissions have been made by lawyers at the inquest into the murder of a County Tyrone pensioner in 1994.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Roseann Mallon, 76, was killed by UVF gunmen as she watched television at her sister's house near Dungannon.
A lawyer for her family outlined nine points that, he said, reinforced the family's view that the loyalist paramilitaries did not act alone.
But a lawyer for the PSNI and Ministry of Defence said it was wrong to say there had been collusion.
He accepted that while the police investigation had been extensive, the inquest proceedings had identified some frailties and shortcomings.
However, he added that "it would be totally wrong and manifestly unjust to translate these frailties and shortcomings into evidence of collusion".
The lawyer for the Mallon family said: "In their view there were state forces at work here, in both events leading up to the murder and events that followed."
The judge described police attempts to explain a delay in providing some documents to the inquest as "like reading Alice in Wonderland".
Mr Justice Weir told the court that he hoped the evidence would be formally closed once an outstanding disclosure issue relating to one document had been resolved.
