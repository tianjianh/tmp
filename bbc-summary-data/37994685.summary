[SN]TITLE[SN]
French boat sank in Devon harbour due to 'language difficulties'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A French fishing trawler sank in a Devon harbour due to "language difficulties", a report has revealed.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Saint Christophe 1 took refuge in Dart Harbour in March but began to sink hours later.
A Marine Accident Investigation Branch report said harbour staff were unable to tell the vessel's skipper the boat would ground as the tide went out.
Dart Harbour said it accepted the report's findings and is acting on its recommendations.

The report said most of the boat's watertight doors were open and the vessel was not carrying any of the local harbour charts.
When the Saint Christophe 1 and another boat, the Sagitaire, arrived into port, one of the river officers attempted to explain the berth using hand gestures.
But the communication was not understood, the report said.
Neither the harbourmaster nor his deputy knew there was a list of people who could act as translators if needed, the report said.
Ten fishermen were rescued when the boats were listing and aground as the tide went out in the early hours of 10 March. No-one was injured.
As the tide came back in, the Saint Christophe 1 began to flood through open doors and portholes.
A number of changes have been made by Dart Harbour and Navigation Authority:
The skippers "displayed a very relaxed attitude" to the safety of their vessels in port and had not attempted to check the tide information, which was available in French.
The report said: "Most of the watertight doors and hatches were either lashed open, or were impossible to close and make watertight, having been disabled at some time in the past. Portholes on the starboard side were also open to allow for ventilation."
Had these been secured its possible the vessel would not have been lost, the report says.
Dart Harbour and Navigation Authority (DHNA) staff's response helped to rescue the crew and quickly deploy pollution prevention equipment.
Board chairman of DHNA, Neil Hockaday said: "DHNA accepts the critical comments made in the report and is responding with remedial action to address the concerns expressed."
