Sikorsky grounds S92 helicopters for checks after incident

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Helicopter manufacturer Sikorsky has grounded all S92 aircraft for safety checks following an incident on a North Sea platform.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Operators have been instructed to carry out the checks immediately.
It is understood they centre around the tail rotors, and will take several hours per aircraft.
The Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) is investigating an incident on the West Franklin Platform which happened last month.
An S92 experienced a technical fault when it was coming in to land. It left "significant gouge marks" on the deck of the platform.
Flights on and offshore are expected to be disrupted for the rest of the day.
Sikorsky issued the safety checks instruction overnight.
