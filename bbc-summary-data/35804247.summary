Former Cheltenham and Bristol Rovers coach North joined the Spitfires to work alongside Todd in October 2015.
Strevens, who is serving a seven-game suspension for spitting, takes on a player-coach role at an Eastleigh side just two points adrift of the National League play-off spots.
"I'm doing it for the best of the club, myself and the players," said Todd.
Todd, who previously played for North while he was an assistant manager at Torquay United, told BBC Radio Solent: "It just wasn't working and I decided to let him go.
"I thank him for his effort and time at the football club but you move on because that's football."
Eastleigh, eighth in National League, host Bromley on Tuesday in search of their third straight victory.
