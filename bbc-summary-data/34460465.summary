Two men have gone on trial charged with shooting dead a man as he sat in a car at traffic lights in Sheffield.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Asif Yousaf, 33, and Jama Ahmed, 26, are accused of murdering 22-year-old Jordan Thomas on 21 December.
Mr Thomas was shot twice in the chest by a lone gunman as he sat in the car on Derek Dooley Way. The driver of the car, Neshaun Ferguson, was also shot.
Mr Yousaf and Mr Ahmed, both from Sheffield, deny charges of murder and attempted murder.
Sheffield Crown Court heard Mr Thomas had been travelling in a silver Ford Mondeo with 28-year-old Mr Ferguson when they were attacked at about 22:15 GMT.
Prosecutor Bryan Cox QC said a burgundy Mitsubishi Shogun had pulled up next to their car and a man had got out and fired three shots into the vehicle before fleeing.
Mr Thomas died as a result of his injuries.
He told the jury that on the day of the killing, Mr Ahmed had travelled to the Birley Spa Lane area of Sheffield to purchase the Mitsubishi Shogun allegedly used in the killing.
He said Mr Ahmed had then made a call to Mr Yousaf at about 21:38.
The court heard that two days before the attack, Mr Thomas and Mr Ahmed had been involved in an altercation between two groups outside the Forward nightclub in Charter Square, Sheffield, after which shots were said to have been fired.
Mr Cox said the incident was linked to an ongoing feud between the groups.
Mr Yousaf's parents, Mohammed Yousaf, 61, and Tazeem Bi, 57, both from Sheffield, are also standing trial accused of perverting the course of justice.
It is alleged they told police their son was at home at the time of the shooting.
The trial continues.
