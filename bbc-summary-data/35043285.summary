[SN]TITLE[SN]
Hatton Garden raid accused found with 'note about loot transfer'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
One of the men accused over the Hatton Garden jewel raid attempted to tear up a note about the loot transfer when he was arrested, a court heard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
William "Bill" Lincoln, 60, denies being part of the conspiracy to burgle the safety desposit, in central London.
Jewels and precious metals estimated at Â£14m were taken in the raid over Easter, Woolwich Crown Court heard.
Mr Lincoln was arrested in his car on 19 May after leaving the address written on the note, it is alleged.
The prosecution has told the court that as he was arrested Mr Lincoln, of Winkley Street, Bethnal Green, was driving away from the Old Wheatsheaf pub in Enfield, where stolen goods from the jewel raid were transferred from co-defendant Jon Harbinson's car to raid ringleader John Collins' car.
Previously, Mr Collins pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit burglary, however Mr Harbinson denies this charge and also denies conspiracy to conceal, convert or transfer criminal property.
Mr Lincoln was stopped by plain clothes officers and pulled out of the driver's seat as he was leaning over the centre console, close to where the pieces of a handwritten note was found in the passenger side footwell.
The note gave the address of the pub, the court heard. Mr Lincoln told the detective who arrested him that he was experiencing pain following a double-hip replacement as well as suffering incontinence.
While in police custody at Wood Green police station, Mr Lincoln repeatedly asked to use the toilet, but soiled himself when he was denied the request.
Det Con Matthew Benedict told the court: "They said he could not go the toilet at the moment. And by the time I came back he had already wet himself."
