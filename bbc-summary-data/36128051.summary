A body found in a disused churchyard is thought to be that of a missing student.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Human remains were found in undergrowth off Albert Fearn Gardens in Foleshill, Coventry, by a member of the public last week.
Police believe the remains to be those of 24-year-old Ozi Akerele who went missing during the early hours of 31 January.
It is thought the Nigerian student lost his way home in freezing temperatures.
His family, who visited Coventry to hand out flyers and help with the search, have been informed. Formal identification has not yet taken place.
Mr Akerele was studying for a masters degree at Coventry University.
