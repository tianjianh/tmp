Report calls for HS3 rail stops in Bradford and York

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A "strong case" exists for HS3 stations to be built in Bradford and York, according to a new study.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The work, led by the West Yorkshire Combined Authority, claims the plans are too "narrowly focused" on connecting six major northern cities and Manchester Airport.
It said "too little attention" had been paid to the needs of other cities.
Transport for the North (TfN) previously said a recommended route was due in 2017.
It is currently carrying out a feasibility study into the government's plans for HS3 - also dubbed Northern Powerhouse Rail.
Plans for a high-speed rail link between Manchester and Leeds were first announced in 2014.
The combined authority's report said there have been concerns TfN's remit concentrated mainly on serving Leeds, Liverpool, Sheffield, Newcastle, Hull, Manchester and the airport.
Stops in Bradford and York would boost the economy and regeneration, it said.
Andy Caton, from the West and North Yorkshire Chamber of Commerce, supported its recommendations.
He said: "[A stop in Bradford] would not just improve connectivity and commuting times but Bradford would benefit enormously from regeneration impacts, more people, more footfall, more business coming in to the area.
"In establishing better transport through Leeds to Manchester it's logical that you also have a station in York because that then opens up not just York but all of the north of Yorkshire."
