The WBBL is a Twenty20 competition with eight franchises  - aligned with the men's Big Bash League teams - playing 59 games from 5 December to 24 January.
"I'm very excited about signing for Brisbane Heat," said Cross, who will be joined by team-mate Lauren Winfield.
England recently lost the multi-format Women's Ashes series to Australia.
However, Lancashire's Cross hopes the opportunity to play down under alongside Australia's top women players, and other international stars, can be of significant help to the national side.
"We are currently enjoying unprecedented times for women's cricket, with increasing levels of professionalism, improving standards and a constantly growing profile," she added.
"With the ICC World Twenty20 in India coming up early next year, playing in the WBBL will give us the perfect opportunity to practise our skills against some of the best players in the world in a highly competitive environment.
"Playing in the WBBL should also give us a taste of what we can look forward to experiencing in the ECB's Women's Cricket Super League in England next summer."
Also heading to Australia will be England captain Charlotte Edwards (Perth Scorchers), vice-captain Heather Knight (Hobart Hurricanes) and wicketkeeper Sarah Taylor (Adelaide Strikers) - all of whom had successful spells with Australian state sides in last winter's Women's National Cricket League (WNCL).
Meanwhile, fast bowler Katherine Brunt joins Edwards at the Scorchers, and all-rounder Danielle Wyatt has signed for Melbourne Renegades.
Fellow spinner Laura Marsh will play for New South Wales in the 50-over WNCL - while Knight, Taylor, Winfield and Wyatt will also feature in the WNCL.
