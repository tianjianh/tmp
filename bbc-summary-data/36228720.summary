The Music Group said a consultation on redundancies at its Tannoy loudspeaker production facility in Coatbridge began on Tuesday.
The consultation will last for at least 30 days, according to the company.
Production of audio equipment at the plant is understood to be moving to China.
Tannoy is one of the oldest audio brands in the world, having been founded as the Tulsemere Manufacturing Company in 1926.
It has had a base in Coatbridge since the 1970s.
The company remains active in a range of audio sectors including residential hi-fi and studio monitoring.
Peter Sommer, senior vice president of lifestyle at The Music Group, said: "I can confirm that Music does propose to dismiss as redundant around 70 staff at its manufacturing and office facility in Coatbridge.
"However, I would emphasize that no final decision has been taken in relation to these proposals, which are the subject of a detailed collective consultation process which began on Tuesday 3 May 2016 and which will last for at least 30 days and possibly more.
"In the event that the proposed dismissals are ultimately confirmed following the conclusion of the consultation process, the Coatbridge facility would cease operations and the plant would close.
"Given that the proposals are at a formative stage, there is of course no definitive time scale in place, but it is envisaged that any closure would likely be towards the end of the year."
He added: "Music is of course mindful of its obligation to seek out any suitable alternative employment for any employees whom it is confirmed are to be made redundant, and to that end the company will be doing all that it can to try to identify any suitable alternative roles which may exist in any of its operations in Europe and beyond."
Mick Conroy, GMB Scotland senior officer, said: "In the year of Tannoy's 90th anniversary, it's an absolute tragedy that the long-serving Coatbridge workforce has been rewarded with the sack.
"These latest redundancies also show the total free-fall in Scotland's manufacturing sector as our slide towards a low-skill, low-wage and precarious economy gathers apace without any intervention.
"A key priority of the next Scottish government must be to address our manufacturing crisis by bringing forward a meaningful industrial strategy that can help steer our economy back towards growth."
