Ronaldo, Rooney, Bolt & Stanton: Sport's highest earners compared

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Giancarlo Stanton might be an unfamiliar name to most people outside North America, but the baseball player has been elevated to one of the highest earners in sport after signing a £208m ($325m) 13-year contract with the Miami Marlins.

Under the terms of the most expensive deal in United States sporting history, the 25-year-old slugger will earn £16m per year, £307,692 per week, £1,831.50 per hour and £30.53 per minute.
It is a particularly stunning headline figure given that the Marlins' payroll for their entire 25-man roster in 2014 was only £33.4m with Stanton's previous contract with them worth just over £4m annually.
The value of the deal makes it a Major League Baseball record, although the £187m ($292m) 10-year contract Detroit Tigers' Miguel Cabrera signed in March pays more annually.
BBC Sport looks at how Stanton compares to a selection of sport's highest earners.
And in the time it's taken you to read this far, he's earned £26.
The unbeaten five-division world champion is known as 'Money Mayweather' for a reason.
According to the Forbes 2014 list of the world's highest-paid athletes, the 37-year-old earned approximately £67m ($105m) from fights against Saul Alvarez and Marcos Maidana.
He is only the second sportsman or sportswoman to break the $100m (£64m) barrier, after golfer Tiger Woods, despite having no personal endorsements.
Mayweather signed a 30-month, six-fight deal with pay-per-view broadcasters Showtime in 2013 and tops the list.
Forbes say he has earned almost £255m ($400m) in the ring since he turned professional in 1996.
The Portuguese forward, 29, is second in the Forbes list, with an estimated annual salary of £33.2m topped up by endorsements worth £17.9m.
Ronaldo signed a new five-year contract with Real Madrid in September 2013. He has scored 275 goals in 262 games for the Champions League holders.
Woods, 38, topped the Forbes' list for 12 consecutive years until 2011 but his earnings have suffered a significant drop since he was engulfed by scandal in his personal life in 2009.
The loss of sponsors such as Accenture and EA Sports hit his bottom line, while increasing injury problems have limited his tournament play and contributed to a downturn in results.
However, despite failing to win a major tournament since 2008, Woods is still sixth in the Forbes ranking with a total income of approximately £39.1m, £35.1m of which comes from endorsements and £4m from salary and winnings.
The winner of 17 Grand Slam titles, it is a keenly-contested debate as to whether the 33-year-old Swiss is the greatest tennis player of all time, but he is almost certainly the most beloved and his worldwide popularity has contributed to his vast earnings.
Seventh on the Forbes list, Federer's income was approximately £35.9m, with £33.2m from endorsements and £2.7m from his achievements on a tennis court.
The 29-year-old Briton's current annual salary is $31m (£19.8m) without including bonuses and endorsements.
However, if the Mercedes driver wins his second Formula 1 World Championship on Sunday, he can expect his earnings to increase substantially.
The Manchester United and England striker's latest contract, signed in February this year, is relatively close to the deal signed by Stanton, with the 29-year-old earning roughly £46.50 per hour less than the Miami Marlins man.
Rooney is thought to earn up to £300,000 a week, £1,785 every hour and just under £30 every minute.
If he saw out the length of the five-and-a-half-year deal, it will earn him more than £70m.
Forbes has his annual income at £15m, with £11.8m from his salary and £3.2m from endorsements.
The six-time Jamaican Olympic gold medallist, 28, has estimated earnings of £14.8m, almost all of which came through endorsements.
German sportswear company Puma provide his main sponsorship, worth approximately £6.4m annually.
