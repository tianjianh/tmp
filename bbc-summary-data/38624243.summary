Tottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino is concerned defender Jan Vertonghen sustained a "bad" injury in the 4-0 Premier League win over West Brom.

The centre-back, 29, appeared to be in tears after turning his left ankle after half-time at White Hart Lane.
"We need to wait for tomorrow and Monday to assess him better. It looks bad," said Pochettino.
"He is disappointed and in a very difficult period but we will push him to recover quickly to try to help him."
Vertonghen has played 20 of Tottenham's 21 league matches this season, forming part of a defence that has conceded just 14 goals - the best record in the league.
Former England midfielder Danny Murphy: "Dele Alli did some magical things. There is nothing he can't do.
"He loves nutmegs… poor old Darren Fletcher. I didn't know he had this quality and vision… he just gets better every week. He's a wonderful talent."
Former Arsenal striker Ian Wright: "Full-backs Danny Rose and Kyle Walker are just unbelievable. West Brom's Nacer Chadli had the thankless task of dealing with Rose, who is one of the best left-backs in Europe right now.
"When you have the insurance of midfielders Mousa Dembele and Victor Wanyama, Rose can go forward."
Spurs travel to Manchester City on 21 January and will do so buoyed by seven wins in a row, including one over leaders Chelsea on 4 January.
They are second in the table, although Liverpool and Manchester City could climb above them with victories on Sunday.
Pochettino's side capitulated in last season's title race, failing to win any of their last four games of the campaign, but the Argentine says Spurs are in "good position for big things".
"We are much better than last season," he said. "We are more mature.
"If you want to fight and challenge for big things we need to follow performances like Chelsea with this one. After Chelsea we feel confident, with a good energy."
