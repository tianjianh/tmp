Rosie-Mai Iredale, 26, is raising money for a children's charity Full Reach.
Dressed in pyjamas and a dressing gown, she started her challenge late last month and hopes to complete it in three months.
Ms Iredale, who has had to contend with heavy rain showers and strong winds, is close to reaching Inverness on her journey south.
She sleeps in the bed at night in campsites, but also gardens offered to her by people she meets on her trek.
Thousands of people every year walk, cycle and drive from John O'Groats to Land's End or vice versa.
Last month, cyclists Dominic Irvine and Charlie Mitchell from Hampshire broke an endurance record that was first set almost 50 years ago.
They cycled non-stop on a tandem from Land's End to John O'Groats in 45 hours 11 minutes and two seconds, beating the record first set in 1966 by five hours.
In 2013, Sean Conway, 32, from Cheltenham, swam from Land's End to John O'Groats following a route up Britain's west coast.
