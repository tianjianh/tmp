Guto Williams, from Botwnnog, was turned away by staff at Ysbyty Bryn Beryl hospital in Pwllheli because it had closed two hours earlier.
But staff still at the hospital would not let Guto in and did not call an ambulance.
His parents then called an ambulance to take him to hospital in Bangor.
They could not drive him the 25 miles there himself because he was in too much pain to wear a seatbelt.
Eirian Holt said she was annoyed her son had had to suffer longer than he should have.
She said it was also a worry if other people in the area could not receive treatment.
Ms Holt said when they stopped at Bryn Beryl hospital on 16 July, staff answered the intercom but did not offer to phone for an ambulance for Guto.
"So we had to wait in the car for an ambulance to come," she said.
"He wasn't allowed to sit inside to wait or have any treatment whatsoever there.
"And then he was taken onto Bangor. The nurses and doctors were fantastic there with him.
"I just feel if we'd had something for the pain in Bryn Beryl it would have saved having to have the ambulance out as well."
A spokesperson for Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board said the minor injuries unit at Bryn Beryl Hospital is open from 10:00 to 18:00 daily.
The minor injuries unit in Ysbyty Alltwen at Porthmadog is open between 08:00 and 20:00 and the GP out-of-hours service from 18:30 to 08:00 during the week and 24 hours on weekends and bank holidays.
The emergency department at Ysbyty Gwynedd is also open around the clock.
The spokesperson added: "We would like to apologise that the nurse did not offer to call for an ambulance or offer access to the hospital whilst they waited for the emergency service to attend."
