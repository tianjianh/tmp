"Dogs gone," Barnaby Joyce tweeted.
Depp was accused of not declaring Yorkshire Terriers Boo and Pistol to customs officials when they flew into Queensland by private jet last month.
Thanking Depp and his wife Amber Heard for co-operating, Mr Joyce said Australia had "strict biosecurity requirements for good reasons".
He had given Depp a deadline of Saturday to return the dogs to the US or they would be put down.
Australia's quarantine regulations aim at preventing diseases such as rabies reaching its shores.
But Mr Joyce has been criticised for his strong stance, with thousands signing a petition to spare them. He received praise and condemnation from people using the #WarOnTerrier hashtag.
Mr Joyce defended his position by saying: "If we start letting movie stars even though they've been the 'sexiest man alive' twice to come into our nation, then why don't we just break the laws for everybody?"
The dogs' illicit entry appears to have been uncovered after a grooming salon on the Gold Coast posted pictures of them on its Facebook page.
Biosecurity officials then visited the vast Gold Coast house Depp and Heard are renting on Wednesday and ordered the dogs into quarantine.
Depp is in Australia to shoot the fifth film in the Pirates of the Caribbean series.
