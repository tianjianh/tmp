[SN]TITLE[SN]
Super League: Huddersfield Giants 24-16 St Helens

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Lee Gaskell scored the clinching try as Huddersfield Giants beat St Helens to move up to seventh in Super League.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Leroy Cudjoe and Martin Ridyard put Huddersfield into a 12-0 lead.
However, Saints recovered from a patchy start to reduce the gap to two points with scores either side of half-time from Luke Thompson and Mark Percival.
Huddersfield's Adam O'Brien and St Helens prop Kyle Amor both crossed before former Saints man Gaskell touched down for the hosts late on.
Saints are sixth in the table, one point above Huddersfield, with five league matches remaining before the split for the Super 8s.
If either side wins four of those five games, they will guarantee a top-eight finish and avoid the Qualifiers.
