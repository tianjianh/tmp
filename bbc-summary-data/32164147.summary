A unique art exhibition has been unveiled on Anglesey, with giant canvasses displayed at the exact beauty spots where they were painted.

The 2.5 metre-tall acrylic oil canvasses, dubbed 'Four on Anglesey' depict iconic views from the island.
They were painted over the course of a week by landscape artist Anthony Garratt and hoisted on to steel structures.
It is hoped residents and visitors will be inspired and do a double take.
They depict views of Caernarfon, Snowdonia, the Great Orme, the Llyn Peninsula and the Irish Sea and will be on display until October.
The paintings were commissioned by owner of the Menai Holiday Cottages Bun Matthews, who wanted a "unique" celebration. She hopes residents and visitors will do a 'double take' on the view.
