Second doctors' strike day 'likely to be more difficult'

The second day of the 48-hour junior doctors' strike on Thursday is likely to be more difficult for hospitals in England, NHS bosses are warning.

Doctors walked out at 08:00 GMT on Wednesday in the third stoppage in their dispute with the government over the imposition of a new contract.
Over 5,000 operations were cancelled before the action and hospitals seemed to cope well on the first day.
But NHS England said Thursday was likely to prove "more challenging".
Dr Anne Rainsberry, who is in charge of planning during the strike, suggested hospitals might find it difficult to discharge patients without junior doctors working, which could then clog up hospital wards.
She said this was because they had a vital role in chasing up test results and ensuring patients were ready for discharge.
"So far the NHS is holding up, but we always expected the second half of the strike to be more challenging," she said.
She also urged patients to go to hospital only when absolutely necessary.
"If people need medical help and it's not an emergency they should consider NHS Choices, visit their local pharmacy,  or call their GP or NHS 111 for more serious matters.
"If their condition is an emergency or life-threatening they should call 999 as usual or go to A&E."
Doctors are providing emergency cover during the walkout, which ends on Friday morning, and consultants, nurses and midwives are all working in hospital as normal. GP surgeries are largely unaffected.
On Wednesday just over half of junior doctors expected in work did not turn up - a figure broadly in line with the previous strikes and to be expected considering the numbers needed to provide emergency care.
The latest walkout is the third in the long-running dispute, but the first to last 48 hours.
So far 19,000 operations and treatments have had to be postponed because of industrial action. The NHS carries out about 30,000 procedures a day.
Thousands of check-ups, appointments and tests have been affected as well.
Katherine Murphy, of the Patients Association, said she had "growing concern" about the dispute.
"Whatever the rights and wrongs of the arguments put forward by either side, the failure to resolve the differences by agreement is bad for doctors, bad for the taxpayer, but above all bad for patients and the NHS."

This week's walkout is the first of three 48-hour stoppages planned by the British Medical Association as it continues its fight against the government's plans to force through the changes to pay and conditions. The next two are planned for April.
The union has also said it will be launching a legal challenge to oppose the imposition of the contract that was announced following last month's strike.
But ministers have said they will be pushing ahead with imposition regardless. The new contracts are due to go out in May and will come into force from August.
Analysis: Was a deal ever possible?
The BMA said it "deeply regretted" the disruption that was being caused, but the action was necessary because of the "unfair" changes being imposed on the profession.
Danny Mortimer, chief executive of NHS Employers, said it was "hugely disappointing" that doctors were taking action as the contract was "safe, fair and reasonable".
He said the strike would be causing "much disruption to patients and their families which is completely unnecessary".
