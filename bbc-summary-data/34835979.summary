The Carmignac Foundation launched the Carmignac Photojournalism Award in 2009, with the aim of supporting and celebrating photojournalism and emerging photographers.
Kai Wiedenhofer was the first recipient to receive funding to visit an area "at the centre of geostrategic conflict, where human rights and freedom of speech are often violated". His series focused on life in Gaza.
Massimo Berruti's long-term assignment in the Swat valley, Pakistan, explored the daily life of the Lashkars - the civilian militia of tribal warriors, who place themselves in the front line facing the Taliban.
In this photo, Lashkar members prepare for a night patrol in the hujra (room for guests) of a tribe elder, Ahmed Khan, whose photo is on the wall.
In 2011, Robin Hammond travelled to Zimbabwe to see what life was like under the Mugabe regime.
"In Bulawayo, hundreds displaced in Operation Murambatsvina were relocated to a rundown block of flats without water and electricity. It was meant to be a temporary measure but seven years later they are still waiting for proper housing. The filthy and overcrowded buildings have become a hotbed of political violence," wrote Hammond.
Chechnya was the focus for winner Davide Monteleone. The Italian's project, Spasibo, documents life in the southern Russian republic of Chechnya, focusing on the social, political and economic situation.
In this photo, "Rada, age 14, is trying on a wedding dress designed by her sister, on board a bus during the rehearsal for the shooting of a movie on Chechen deportation."
The Iranian photojournalist and fifth Carmignac laureate Newsha Tavakolian's project explores the lives of young middle-class Iranians dealing with "an increasingly modern society and revolutionary Islamic ideology".
Tavakolian completed her report between December 2013 and April 2014. Her identity was kept secret for security reasons.
This year's award went to Christophe Gin, who spent five months exploring the landscapes of Guiana. "His photography bears witness to the reality of life in a land full of contrasts, far from the caricatures often presented through the mainstream press," says the Carmignac Foundation.
Carmignac Photojournalism Award: A Retrospective is on show from 18 November - 13 December 2015 at The Saatchi Gallery, London.
