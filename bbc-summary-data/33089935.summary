US benchmark indexes - the Dow Jones, S&P 500 and the Nasdaq - all closed more than 1.2% higher overnight on a rally by technology and banking shares - setting the tone for Asia.
Japan's Nikkei 225 closed up 1.7% at 20,382.97, posting the biggest percentage gain in four months.
The yen strengthened on the US dollar.
The rally came after Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda said the currency is already "very weak" on Wednesday.
The dollar was at 123.21 yen in Tokyo, but still some distance away from a 13-year high of 125.86 it hit last week.

Hong Kong's Hang Seng index closed up 0.83% to 26,907.85, while the Shanghai Composite closed up 0.3% to 5,121.59.

The benchmark Kospi index finished up 0.3% to 2,056.61 - ending a four-day losing streak.
The country followed a surprise move made earlier in the day by New Zealand's central bank, which also cut interest rates by 25 basis points to 3.25%.
The  benchmark NZ50 share index closed up 0.9% to 5,856.57 after the central bank left the door open for further easing to boost a slowing economy.
In Australia, the S&P/ASX 200 index ended higher 1.4% to 5,556.70 on positive employment data.
Australian employment jumped in May by 42,000 jobs, well above expectations, while the unemployment rate fell to a one-year low of 6%.
