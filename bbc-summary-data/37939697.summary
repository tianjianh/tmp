Romelu Lukaku: Everton fan groups back Ronald Koeman over comments

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Everton boss Ronald Koeman was right to suggest striker Romelu Lukaku needs to leave Goodison Park to fulfil his potential, according to two of the club's supporters' groups.

Koeman told Belgian newspaper HLN that Lukaku, 23, has potential "greater and higher" than his current club.
George McKane, a founding member of the Everton Supporters' Trust, said Koeman is acting in Everton's best interests.
"It makes a pleasant change for someone to tell the truth," he told BBC Sport.
"What he's saying is what a lot of Evertonians are thinking."
McKane said Dutchman Koeman's comments on Lukaku, who reportedly handed in a transfer request this summer, could be aimed at raising the Belgium international's price.
Lukaku joined Everton for a club record Â£28m in July 2014, having scored 16 goals in all competitions during a season on loan from Chelsea.
He scored 20 goals in 2014-15 and 25 last season, and has seven of Everton's 15 Premier League goals this season. He is under contract until 2019.
Dave Kelly, chairman of supporters' group Blue Union, said Lukaku is not yet at the level of a Champions League striker, but that more Everton players should be trying to attract the interest of Europe's top sides.
"He should have ambition. Why should Romelu Lukaku have any responsibility to stay at Everton? He's not an Evertonian," Kelly said.
"I would love him to stay, but every player has his price. It's unfortunate that more of our players are not getting looked at by the European leagues.
"There needs to be a statement of intent from our owner, that if clubs want to buy our players it will be on our terms and for top dollar."
