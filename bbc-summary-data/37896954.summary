[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Friends and family of a Ceredigion rugby player who died after being hit by a car in Spain have made a plea to secure a plot in a cemetery.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Eifion Gwynne, 41, died last month and it is hoped he can be buried in Plascrug Cemetery, Aberystwyth.
Friend Wayne Thomas, 43, said Mr Gwynne expressed a wish to be buried there.
The only plots left are for people with an exclusive right of burial so relatives hope someone will give up theirs to fulfil Mr Gwynne's wishes.
The funeral for the father-of-three and former Aberystwyth and Llandovery rugby player takes place on Saturday.
Mr Thomas, who has known Mr Gwynne for more than 20 years, said his friend discussed his wishes with his wife.
"He always said he wanted to be buried in this cemetery, it's close to the rugby club and it's close to his home.
"We're hoping someone will offer up a plot that's not needed. It would mean everything to them [his family] it's what Eifion wanted."
If family and friends are unable to secure a plot in Plascrug before the funeral, Mr Gwynne will be buried in Cefn Llan Cemetery, just under one mile away.
Llandovery RFC president Handel Davies described Mr Gwynne as "one of the nicest people" he knew.
A memorial fund set up in Mr Gwynne's memory has raised almost Â£12,000 in donations.
