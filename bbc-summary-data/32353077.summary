The HMAS Choules is said to be hours away from Vietnam's Ho Chi Minh City and is headed to the port of Vung Tau, said Fairfax Media.
The West Australian said the group were first intercepted at sea north of Australia, and some members face persecution in Vietnam.
Australia's tough asylum policies have been criticised by rights groups.
The government has yet to provide an official comment on the reports. The operation is said to be costing the government at least A$1.4m ($1.09m, Â£728,100).
Last year, Australia attempted to return 157 asylum seekers who had sailed from Sri Lanka. They were eventually placed on Nauru island.
