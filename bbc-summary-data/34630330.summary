[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Hibernian reduced the deficit at the top of the Scottish Championship to five points after victory over Rangers in a pulsating match at Easter Road.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Jason Cummings curled in a superb goal for Hibs in the 11th minute.
Hibs' Mark Oxley saved from James Tavernier as Rangers rallied but he was helpless when Darren McGregor deflected in Lee Wallace's shot.
Wallace and Rangers substitute Nathan Oduwa hit the woodwork before Paul Hanlon headed in a 73rd-minute winner.
The defeat ends Rangers' 100% win record in the Championship and takes Hibs' unbeaten record in all competitions to 11 games.
The game began at a frantic pace and the visiting fans were calling for a penalty after three minutes when Jason Holt fell to the ground under a challenge by Lewis Stevenson but, referee John Beaton had a long look at the incident before waving play on.
At the other end John McGinn dithered when he had a clear view of goal and allowed the ball to drift away without getting a shot away.
Hibs moved in front when Cummings collected the ball out on the right and, as the Rangers defence stood back and watched, the 20-year-old lashed in a  stunning strike for his 11th goal of the campaign.
Oxley threw up an arm to deny a fizzing shot by Tavernier but Hibernian came close to adding a second when Marvin Bartley, who had replaced the injured Dylan McGeouch, set up Dominic Malonga.
However, his attempt at curling the ball into the top corner was a yard too high.
Rangers equalised within 90 seconds of the second half beginning when Wallace strode forward and banged a shot at goal that deflected past Oxley via the luckless McGregor.
Rangers looked the team more likely to score a second goal and only a wonderful one-handed save by Oxley kept out Martyn Waghorn's left-foot shot.
The rebound fell to Wallace who crashed a shot off the underside of the crossbar, with McGregor's headed deflection probably saving Rangers from taking the lead.
A delightful ball by McGinn gave Cummings a clear sight of goal after his classy first touch took him away from Rob Kiernan, but that skill was matched by the save from Wes Foderingham.
Nathan Oduwa replaced Danny Wilson as Rangers changed formation to a more conventional 4-4-2.

And it almost paid dividends when Oduwa fired in a shot from the edge of the box that came back off the upright with Oxley scrambling along his line.
Hibernian regained the lead against the run of play when Hanlon took advantage of hesitancy in Rangers' defence to head in a McGinn corner from the right.
And although there were chances for both teams in the closing stages, there were no more goals and the home fans have renewed hope of catching Rangers in the Championship race.
