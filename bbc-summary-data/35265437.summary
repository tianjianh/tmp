The proposal is for a range of uses including museum and heritage, creative industries, education, research and development and hotel and leisure.
It is the largest single regeneration site in Derry.
Environment Minister Mark H Durkan said it was "good news for the city and wider region".
"This application sets out a blueprint that will be a boost for business, tourism and people in the area by revitalising the 1840s site with new homes, offices, cafes, restaurants and museum and arts facilities," he added.
"It will also bring many construction jobs in the short term as well as long term job creation.
"Approval of this development framework provides certainty on the scale and type of development that will be acceptable.
"It will provide a masterplan for the physical regeneration and investment priorities for this pivotal site which is connected to the city centre by the iconic Peace Bridge.
"I look forward to further detailed proposals which will deliver on the vision of the framework."
First Minister Peter Robinson said the approval was "a welcome development" which would have a "positive impact" on the people of the city.
Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness said the further development of the Ebrington site would "transform not just the landscape of the city but also the economic prospects of the North West".
