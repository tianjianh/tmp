Known as One Bankmore Square, the project would be at the Movie House cinema site on Dublin Road.
Taking two years to complete, it would provide Grade A office space for 3,000 workers.
The Richland Group, which is behind the project, believes the planning application can be "determined promptly" by Belfast City Council.
It has already held a public consultation process.
Chief executive Gary McCausland said: "One Bankmore Square is a quantum leap for Belfast's office market.
"It brings world-class Grade A office accommodation to the heart of the city in a single-phase development."
The project would support nearly 600 construction job and has been described as the most significant office scheme in the city in almost a decade.
The cinema remains open in the meantime.
