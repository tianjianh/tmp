[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Six people have appeared in court over the theft of two lorries in Aberdeen.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The vehicles - believed to have contained furniture and alcohol - were stolen from the West Tullos industrial estate in Aberdeen.
They were found ablaze on the A97 south of Huntly early on Monday.
Jordan Fenwick, 21, from Aberdeen, and Guy Bandeen, 23, from Elgin, appeared at Aberdeen Sheriff Court charged with theft and reset. Another three men and a woman also appeared in court.
They were Jill Reid, 40, from Elgin, Alexander Henderson, 24, from Falkirk, John Stewart, 22, from Falkirk, and Scott Morrison, 31, from Aberdeen, who were all charged with reset.
None of the accused made any plea or declaration and all six were released on bail.
A Crown Office spokeswoman said the procurator fiscal had also received a report involving a 28-year-old man.
She said: "The accused was liberated from custody and did not appear in court. The case against him remains live and under consideration."
Officers are still appealing for information surrounding the incident or about a silver Renault Megane car discovered on fire in the Queen's Den area of Hazlehead in Aberdeen.
