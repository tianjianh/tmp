South African authorities had seized two of Mr Malema's houses, a farm and a small holding, to pay his tax arrears.
The unfinished house in Johannesburg features a cinema room and a cigar lounge.
Mr Malema was expelled from the ANC in 2012 for insubordination. He also faces charges of corruption, which he denies.
The plans for the property included four bedrooms and bathrooms, a security bunker, a showroom garage and pyjama lounge, reports the AP news agency.
Dee Reuvers, a local resident, said that neighbours were relieved that Mr Malema would not be occupying the property. "We were concerned about him moving here," she said.
"We were disgusted about the fact that there was so much bling, so much hype going on... when in fact, he has always stated that he was for the people."
The house, in the upmarket Sandton area of the city, fetched double its expected selling price.
The winning bidder was local businessman Norman Tloubatla.
However, South Africa's Revenue Service says Mr Malema still owes well over $2m (Â£1.3m).
Once an ally of Jacob Zuma, the outspoken Mr Malema later fell out with the South African president.
He campaigned for Mr Zuma's removal from office at the ANC's national conference in December.
Mr Malema has accused Jacob Zuma of not doing enough to help the poor black voters who had helped to elect him.
In 2011, South Africa's high court ruled that the anti-apartheid song Shoot the Boer was hate speech and banned the ANC from singing it.
However, Mr Malema and other ANC leaders had objected, arguing that the song was a celebration of the fight against minority rule.
The corruption charge against him relates to a government tender awarded to a company partly owned by his family trust.
He rejects the charge, saying that the case is politically motivated.
