Motherwell 2-1 Heart of Midlothian

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Louis Moult scored a sublime winner as Motherwell came from behind to beat Hearts in the Premiership.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The visitors took the lead thanks to Kyle Lafferty's low drive from distance but Ryan Bowman squared it with a close-range header.
Moult made it 2-1 with a wonderful lobbed effort into the top corner.
The Englishman went close to a second, but the officials decided Christophe Berra had cleared his header off the line.
Hearts' Jamie Walker went closest to an equaliser with a second-half dig from distance that goalkeeper Trevor Carson touched wide.
The win is Well's second Premiership triumph on the spin, and their second of the campaign, while interim Hearts head coach Jon Daly has now overseen one win, one draw and two defeats.
One man may not make a team, but Moult proved how vital he is for Motherwell after Hearts went ahead through Lafferty's strike.
His first telling contribution was an assist for Bowman, nodding Richard Tait's deep delivery back across goal where his team-mate was waiting to head home.
Minutes later, Moult showed his range of skills to bag the winner with a wonderful finish. He gathered on the edge of the box, dug the ball out of his feet and found the top corner with a terrific floated effort.
He thought he had a second with a back-post header that looked in all the way before Berra intervened to clear.
Hearts came into this one on the back of two successive clean sheets and four points from six.
It started so well when Lafferty gathered, drove towards the box and fired an accurate low drive past Carson and just inside the post.
Their solidity at the back deserted them for Motherwell's equaliser, with Bowman left in space to finish easily.
While Moult's winner was a superb finish, questions might also be asked about how he found space in such a dangerous area.
It simply did not click for the visitors, who lacked any real threat for much of the match.
The international break gives the Tynecastle club space to appoint the man they want to become their next permanent head coach - with Hearts owner Ann Budge expected to make an announcement at the beginning of the week - and how Daly would have loved a win ahead of that to reinforce his credentials.
Motherwell will take great confidence from this result, with manager Stevie Robinson appearing to have made some shrewd summer moves.
Keeping hold of Moult until after the transfer window shuts this week would mark more fantastic business for the Fir Park outfit.
Motherwell manager Stephen Robinson: "There's an inner belief that they're never going to be beaten. We earned it. Hearts are a good side but I thought we out-battled them at times.
"Second half, I thought we played really well and probably deserved the result.
"We're creating a lot of chances. I still think there's lots of things we can improve on. Defensively we're very good. We're solid, we're strong and we coped with a bombardment for 5-10 minutes with crosses into the box.
"Louis (Moult) is a Motherwell footballer for the next year unless someone makes an offer that the board can't refuse."
Hearts interim head coach Jon Daly: "I thought we could have played more football; when we did, I thought we were the better team.

"Motherwell are quite direct and they are good at what they do. We did the work on that and it's disappointing not to deal with it.
"It's frustrating. It will be a long two weeks now until the Aberdeen game."
