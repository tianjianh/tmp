[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 20-year-old, who spent time with Eastleigh and Billericay Town last season, was released by Scottish Premiership side Rangers last summer.
"I took a gamble and moved to Rangers under Mark Warburton, which was a great experience, but I didn't make a first-team start," he told the club website.
"I want to settle at a club now and establish myself."
