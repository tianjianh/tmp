[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Glamorgan batsman Colin Ingram has made his comeback in a T20 match for his South African side Warriors, following knee surgery in August 2016.

Ingram, 31, did not play Championship cricket for Glamorgan in 2016 because of the injury, suffered in the warm-up for the opening game of the season.
The left-hander was Glamorgan's player of the year in limited-overs cricket despite an injury-hit season.
He was out for just four in the Warriors' T20 victory over Dolphins.
The former Somerset left-hand batsman is not scheduled to play any four day cricket until January 2017, with the South African fixture list concentrating on limited-overs games until then.
Ingram said before the operation that he hoped to play the longer format of the game again in both the UK and South Africa.
