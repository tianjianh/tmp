Sign up, set up a league with your friends and commence battle for bragging rights across the season.
Each week, former Dundee United, Rangers and St Mirren striker Steven Thompson will take a look at the fixtures in Scotland's top flight and give us his thoughts on how they will pan out.
For his first week, Steven scored correctly predicted four correct results out of the six Premiership matches and one of those was a correct score. So in the Predictor he amassed a decent 70 points (3 x 10 points + 1 x 40 points).
Think you can do better than an ex-pro turned BBC Scotland pundit? What are you are waiting for? Get involved.
"I would've gone for 3-0 had I been totally convinced by Celtic's defence. As much as Celtic have been scoring lots of goals, they've only kept two clean sheets in 11 competitive games this season. Rangers have a strong attack but I feel Celtic have too much for Mark Warburton's side.
"I believe both teams will score but that Celtic will claim victory."
Prediction: Celtic 3-1 Rangers
Result:Celtic 5-1 Rangers
"The Dons' home record is extremely strong and they need to show a reaction to having lost 4-1 last weekend at Celtic Park.  Inverness have had a poor start to the season. However, after a good result last week they'll be aiming to get something out of the game.
"Aberdeen are beginning to lose ground on the teams above them, so they need to ensure they win."
Prediction: Aberdeen 2-0 Inverness CT
Result:Aberdeen 1-1 Inverness CT
"County were poor in their last game but I see this game ending in a draw because both teams have the ammunition to score goals. With Liam Boyce featuring at County, and Motherwell's front three, it will be an open game with goals.
"Mark McGhee will be seeking a reaction from his Motherwell players, with them having lost two in a row."
Prediction: Ross County 2-2 Motherwell
Result: Ross County 1-1 Motherwell
"Hearts are on a roll at the minute, having won their last two games. Their last home game was a convincing 5-1 win against Inverness CT - and I don't think Hamilton are that strong defensively.
"It will be difficult for Accies and I expect Robbie Neilson's side to score goals. Their front two of Tony Watt - who scored his first goal last weekend - and Conor Sammon - are causing defences problems."
Prediction: Hearts 3-0 Hamilton
Result:Hearts 3-1 Hamilton
"Partick won all three games against the Saints last season and I see Alan Archibald's men continuing that winning streak on Saturday.
"Thistle have been playing good football without getting the results for all their hard work. However, with them beating St Johnstone last season, I expect a home win: Kris Doolan will score the winner."
Prediction: Partick 1-0 St Johnstone
Result:Partick 0-2 St Johnstone
"The last two occasions the sides faced each other last season the games ended in draws. Paul Hartley's side have drawn their last two games - and Dundee drew 15 games last season. All signs are pointing towards a share of the spoils at Dens Park.
"Kilmarnock, having drawn at home to Rangers, will prove stuffy opponents and try to defend. I fancy a draw."
Prediction: Dundee 1-1 Kilmarnock
Result:Dundee 1-1 Kilmarnock
