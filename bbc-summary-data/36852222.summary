Labour leadership: Corbyn vows to tackle 'nation's ills'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Jeremy Corbyn has promised to tackle the "five ills of 21st Century Britain" as he launched his official campaign to remain as Labour leader.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Mr Corbyn, who is facing a challenge from Owen Smith, vowed to confront inequality, neglect, prejudice, insecurity and discrimination.
He said a future Labour government would require firms with more than 21 staff to publish equality pay audits.
In the past 48 hours, 183,000 people have signed up to vote in the ballot.
They paid £25 each to become registered supporters by Wednesday's deadline, enabling them to have a say in the contest, with the result due to be announced on 24 September.
Although it is unclear which candidate the new members are likely to support, Mr Corbyn said he was "delighted" by the take-up, while a spokesman said it was "reasonable to assume" that the majority of the new registrations came from supporters of the veteran left-winger.
Labour's 380,000-plus members who joined before 12 January, as well as affiliated supporters from unions and other organisations, are also entitled to vote.
Drawing inspiration from the 1942 Beveridge report - which identified "five giant evils" and is widely regarded as being the foundation of the post-war welfare state - Mr Corbyn committed to coming up with detailed policy solutions to tackle the obstacles "holding individuals and communities back".
Labour Party members, affiliated trade union supporters and so-called registered supporters are able to vote, although there are some key differences from the 2015 contest which Jeremy Corbyn won.

"The injustices that scar society today are not those of 1945... want, squalor, idleness, disease and ignorance," he said.
"And they have changed since I first entered Parliament in 1983…Today what is holding people back above all are inequality, neglect, insecurity, prejudice and discrimination.
"In our campaign I want to confront all five of those ills head on, setting out not only how Labour will campaign against these injustices in opposition but also spelling out some of the measures the next Labour government will take to overcome them and move decisively towards a society in which opportunity and prosperity are truly shared."
Signalling his commitment to tackle workplace discrimination, Mr Corbyn said that if he became prime minister, all firms employing more than 21 staff will have to publish information about the pay, hours and grade of every job.
This, he will say, will highlight the extent to which female, disabled and BME workers remain unfairly treated 40 years on from the Equal Pay Act.
"Last year Britain was ranked 18th in the world for its gender pay gap, below Nicaragua, Namibia and New Zealand," he said. "We can and must do better. So Labour is calling time on the waiting game."
Under the plan, employers could be fined for not providing the information while the Equalities and Human Rights Commission will be given a beefed-up role to monitor their compliance.
Mr Smith has said he will be "just as radical" as Mr Corbyn but is better placed, with the support of the majority of his colleagues, to put principles into practice and get Labour back into a position of being ready to get back in power.
The vast majority of Labour MPs are supporting Mr Smith, a former shadow work and pensions secretary who was among more than 20 shadow cabinet members to walk out of Mr Corbyn's team last month in protest at his leadership.
Last week, the party's ruling National Executive Committee decided that Mr Corbyn, as incumbent leader, was not required to meet the threshold of 51 nominations to stand, but a High Court challenge has been launched against the ruling.
Mr Corbyn has won the right to personally fight the legal action, brought by Labour donor and former parliamentary candidate Michael Foster, which is due to be heard next week.
In an e-mail to party members on Wednesday, the party's general secretary Ian McNicol said the NEC had "set strict guidelines regarding the use of data by candidates in line with guidance from the Information Commissioner" - amid concerns about its use by third party groups.
