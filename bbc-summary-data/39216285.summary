Ballymena United's Tony Kane says the club has come a long way since David Jeffrey took over as boss one year ago.

Kane was speaking as he accepted the player of the NIFWA month award which recognised his team's League Cup win  and top-six finish in the Premiership.
Penalty and free-kick specialist Kane has scored 18 goals this season.
"From fearing relegation last season we have made great progress under David Jeffrey and his assistant Bryan McLoughlin," said 29-year-old Kane.
"They have been able to get every ounce out of the players.
"They are great motivators and I'm delighted because this season things have really clicked for me.
"My game has moved up a level and I feel more valuable to the team.
"People say if you score goals you will get recognised and that's the case. But I just want to win games of football, I don't care who scores.
"Our objective at the start of the season was to make the top six and win a trophy and we have managed to do that."
Ballymena won the League Cup by beating Carrick Rangers 2-0 in the final at Seaview.
Last Saturday, though, they crashed 4-0 at home to derby rivals Coleraine in the Irish Cup quarter-finals.
The player of the month awards are organised by the Northern Ireland Football Writers' Association.
