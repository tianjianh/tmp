The festival will feature more than 310 separate events, showcasing 180 films from 38 countries.
These will include nine world and international premieres, three European premieres and 65 UK premieres.
The festival will run in cinemas and pop-up venues, such as the Snow Factor at Braehead, from 15-26 February.
The opening night of the festival will feature the European premiere of John Butler's Irish coming-of-age film Handsome Devil.
It will close with the world premiere of Mad To Be Normal, starring David Tennant as infamous Scottish psychiatrist R D Laing.
The festival will also showcase the world premiere of Benny, the story of local hero Benny Lynch, widely considered the greatest boxer Scotland has ever produced.
Another sports film is Celtic Soul, in which Canadian actor-filmmaker Jay Baruchel embarks on an epic trip to Celtic FC's Parkhead stadium to see his beloved Hoops in action.
European premieres include road movie Folk Hero & Funny Guy starring US indie favourites David Cross and Alex Karpovsky, and Steven Ellison's directorial debut Kuso, featuring exclusive new tracks from Aphex Twin and Thundercat.
There are UK premieres for Raoul Peck's I Am Not Your Negro, Terrence Malick's Voyage of Time: Life's Journey, Cate Shortland's Berlin Syndrome and Aki KaurismÃ¤ki s The Other Side of Hope.
Films to get their first Scottish screenings include Paul Verhoeven's Golden Globe-winning Elle, Ben Wheatley's Free Fire, Lone Scherfig's Their Finest, Olivier Assayas's Personal Shopper and Edinburgh-based filmmaker Hope Dickson Leach's The Levelling.
Bodkin Ras, filmed in the Scottish Highlands and featuring a cast of non-professional actors from Forres, will get its Scottish premiere at the festival.
End of the Game, David Graham Scott's look at what happens when the vegan filmmaker develops an unlikely bond with an ageing hunter from the Caithness moors, is also in the line-up of Scottish talent at the festival.
Famous faces expected to attend the festival in February include David Tennant, Julian Barratt (The Mighty Boosh) and Ben Wheatley (High Rise).
Veteran director Terence Davies (Sunset Song) will introduce the Scottish premiere of A Quiet Passion.
The festival has made a name for itself with its pop-up events and this year it has a screening of John Carpenter's 1982 sci-fi horror The Thing on the Snow Factor's real snow slope.
The new Barras Art and Design centre will show steamy Cajun noir classic The Big Easy and Dirty Dancing at Ã’ran MÃ³r will include a dance workshop and performance by award-winning ballroom dancers Tibro Poc and Hilary Mouat.
Previously announced special events include a family-fun screening of The Princess Bride complete with live sword fighting and a late-night screening of The Lost Boys at a secret location.
Allison Gardner, Glasgow Film Festival co-director, said: "I love the delight that audiences take from our special events.
"There are some absolutely brilliant experiences this year and I can't wait to feel the blood chill and the audience shiver as we head to Snow Factor for The Thing or revel in Cajun culture when The Big Easy screens at the Barras Art and Design."
Tickets go on sale to Glasgow Film Festival members at noon on Thursday 19 January and on general sale at 10:00 on Monday 23 January.
