The advice, drawn up by the Academy of Medical Royal Colleges, features on a list of 40 treatments that bring little or no benefit to patients.
The list is part of a campaign to reduce the number of unnecessary medical treatments.
Patients are also encouraged to ask more questions about procedures.
Medical experts from 11 different specialties were asked to identify five treatments or procedures commonly used in their field that were not always necessary or valuable.
These have been used as part of the Choose Wisely campaign to highlight the need for patients and doctors to talk frankly about how health issues should be treated.
The advice includes:
The current list of treatments will be added to every year.
The academy says there is evidence that patients often pressure doctors into prescribing or carrying out unnecessary treatments and the NHS is also coming under increasing pressure to reduce over-medicalisation - in other words the medicines and treatments it prescribes.
For some time now, GPs have been advised to cut back on prescribing antibiotics to patients.
The academy says patients should always ask five key questions when seeking treatment.
Prof Dame Sue Bailey, chairwoman of the Academy of Medical Royal Colleges, told the BBC: "Some of these treatments can be quite invasive, time-consuming; there are simpler and as-safe options, so why wouldn't you?
"Because I think what we've got is a culture of 'we can do something, therefore we should do something' and we need to stop and reflect and decide what is the best option for the patient in their individual circumstances."
