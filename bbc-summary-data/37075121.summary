[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Cristhian Stuani scored twice on his Premier League debut as Middlesbrough beat Sunderland in the first Wear-Tees league derby in seven and a half years.

Alvaro Negredo assisted both goals, with Stuani's opener a brilliant 25-yard effort into the top corner.
The Spaniard then unselfishly squared to Stuani for their second.
The Black Cats improved in the second half and Patrick van Aanholt gave them hope when he turned home after Brad Guzan parried Duncan Watmore's shot.
'I fear for Sunderland - even with Moyes in charge' - Kevin Kilbane's MOTD2 analysis
David Moyes' side had been booed off after a first half which saw them fail to test Boro debutant Guzan, replacing the injured Victor Valdes.
But after a second-half revival, they almost had a draw when Guzan fumbled another shot, but Donald Love turned the rebound wide.

Middlesbrough's summer signing of Negredo on loan, only a year after Valencia paid £21.25m for the striker from Manchester City, caused some surprise.
A haul of five goals in La Liga last season meant his £100,000-a-week wages would be a gamble for newly promoted Boro.
But a goal on his debut against Stoke was followed by another key performance. He set up the opener for Stuani, although the goal was very much of the Uruguayan's own making as he smashed home from distance.
Negredo only assisted three goals in 40 games for Valencia last season, but had his second of the day when he could have gone alone. The 31-year-old Spain striker had space to shoot but instead, with goalkeeper Vito Mannone braced to attempt a save, Negredo rolled it across to Stuani to fire home.
Sunderland boss Moyes decided to start with Paddy McNair, usually a defender, in midfield alongside Jack Rodwell. And when they needed a tactical reshuffle following an injury to centre-back John O'Shea, it was Rodwell, rather than McNair who dropped back to defence.
But when Moyes scrapped that experiment at half-time and replaced McNair with midfielder Jeremain Lens, they made a game of it.
After the break they had more shots (14-3), more possession and more passes - having been behind on all of those counts in the first half.
But with 34-year-old debutant Steven Pienaar the only Sunderland player other than Jermain Defoe to have more than 10 Premier League goals in his career, they rarely looked like scoring - with the exception of Van Aanholt's goal.
Sunderland boss David Moyes told BBC Sport: "I did not think we deserved to be 2-0 down at half-time. After we lost John O'Shea, we did not get quite sorted. We did not take some chances but they did.
"We played well, we had a great level of intensity but ran out with 10 minutes to go. We have so many young boys and are at the bare bones. The boys did try to win and score in the second half but were unlucky.
"I took positives from the first half, we played well. Overall, they were fine."

Middlesbrough manager Aitor Karanka: "The most important thing as always is the points. It's always important to win, especially in a derby and for our crowd who have been waiting for this moment for a long time, so I'm pleased for the players and the crowd.
"The key was the first half. I told the players they would start at 150% but with players of the quality of Cristhian Stuani we were able to score a first goal like that which opened up the game.
"In the second half we had problems but that's normal. The players showed we are ready for the season. We are playing well, compact and with intensity so it was important to get points as quickly as possible."
