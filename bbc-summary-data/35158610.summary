Three firms have been shortlisted to put forward plans for the multimillion-pound redevelopment of the site of Northampton's former bus station.

The Brutalist Greyfriars building, likened to the "mouth of hell", was demolished in March having dominated the town's skyline for about 40 years.
The firms are putting forward plans for a mix of uses for the site.
They include plans for shops, homes and leisure facilities on the four-acre (1.62 hectare) town centre location.
The companies have now been asked by Northampton Borough Council to prepare detailed proposals and drawings for the site, with a deadline at the end of March 2016.
Their proposals will then be put on display to the public before a final decision on the preferred scheme is made by council's cabinet later in the spring.
Tim Hadland, cabinet member for regeneration, said: "We will be looking for an ambitious scheme that allows this site to fulfil its potential and brings value to the town centre for years to come.
"We expect an exciting scheme at Greyfriars that will open up the area and enhance the town centre as a whole.
"A site on this scale in a town centre is a rare opportunity, and we are committed to getting the best scheme we can," he said.
The 1970s building was once described as "like a great big mouth of hell" by Channel 4 presenter and designer Kevin McCloud.
