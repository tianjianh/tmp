"So many parents are coming up to me and saying 'My child is already planning ahead'," Meadows said.
"They're changing sport or wanting to go at another one - they're trying to work out what age they'll be at the next Olympics."
Thomas added: "It's such a good time to be a British athlete - to be around so much success."
"There'll be a moment that the light goes on and you think 'wow, that was the moment that inspired me to be an Olympian or be the best I can be."
