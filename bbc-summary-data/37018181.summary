[SN]TITLE[SN]
Notts County 1-2 Plymouth Argyle

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Nauris Bulvitis' first goal in English football handed Plymouth their first victory of the season as they ground out a 2-1 win at Notts County to end a three-game losing run.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Jake Jervis had earlier opened Plymouth's account for the season with a clinical strike before veteran striker Jon Stead hauled County level.
But Bulvitis, signed in the summer from Spartaks Jurmala, rose highest to meet Connor Smith's 32nd-minute corner and bag the Pilgrims all three points.
Sonny Bradley came to Plymouth's rescue after 10 minutes when he cleared a Stead shot off the line before Matt Tootle's follow-up was blocked by Oscar Threlkeld.
It was Argyle, through, who opened the scoring five minutes later when Gary Miller intercepted a wayward pass and found Jervis, who drilled a low shot into the bottom corner.
Notts were behind for just three minutes as Stead broke free down the right, cut into the box, beat two players and fired an effort past Luke McCormick.
Home debutant Louis Laing had a shot blocked and headed over, either side of Bradley slicing a clearance against his own woodwork.
Sloppy defending from Notts, though, handed Argyle the initiative once more as Latvian international Bulvitus nodded in Smith's corner.
Jonathan Forte flicked a header just wide early in the second half and Tootle nodded Alex Rodman's cross off target, while in a rare Plymouth attack, Graham Carey's shot was kept out by Adam Collin.
McCormick brilliantly kept out Thierry Audel's shot in injury time as Plymouth hung on to the points.
