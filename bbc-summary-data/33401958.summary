Leah Washington, 17, from Barnsley, South Yorkshire, was on the front row of the Smiler ride, which crashed into an empty carriage in front of it.
She posted the picture of herself with 15 people on her Facebook page.
The teenager's left leg was amputated above the knee and she also fractured her hand in the crash on 2 June.
Miss Washington was among five people seriously injured in the collision, which led to 16 people on the ride being trapped for up to four-and-half hours.
Vicky Balch, from Lancashire, who was also sitting on the front row of the carriage, had her right leg amputated below the knee following seven rounds of surgery.
Merlin Entertainment Group, which owns the theme park, said all 16 passengers on board would receive compensation. A law firm representing eight of those injured said interim payments were released to help with the victims' rehabilitation at the end of June.
Miss Washington's new picture was "liked" by several hundred people on Facebook.
The teenager was at Alton Towers with her 18-year-old boyfriend Joe Pugh, who shattered both knees and suffered hand injuries in the incident.
