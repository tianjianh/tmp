The Bishop of Gloucester has been interviewed by police investigating two allegations of indecent assault.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Rt Rev Michael Perham announced on Friday he would "step-back" from his duties with immediate effect.
Police confirmed only that a 66-year-old man attended a police station in Gloucester on Tuesday but was not arrested.
The Diocese of Gloucester said it was a police matter and it would not be making any further comment.
The alleged offences, dating back to 1980 and 1981, relate to a child under the age of 18 and a woman over that age.
A Metropolitan Police spokesman confirmed its officers were investigating.
On Monday the Diocese of Gloucester said measures had been put in place for the Bishop of Tewkesbury, the Rt Rev Martyn Snow, to take up Bishop Perham's duties in his absence.
Bishop Perham is due to retire in November.
According to the diocese's website Bishop Perham "served on the Church of England Liturgical Commission from 1982 to 2001, being one of the principal architects of its Common Worship services".
"He is now a member of the House of Lords and of the House of Bishops' Standing Committee.
"He has been a strong advocate of the role of women in the church as priests and bishops."
A special service is due to take place on 8 November to celebrate his time as Bishop of Gloucester.
