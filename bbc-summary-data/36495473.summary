The 27-year-old, who won silver at last year's world championships, landed a 6.67m jump to finish behind Canada's Christabel Nettey and winner Ivana Spanovic of Serbia.
Fellow Brits Anyika Onuora and Tiffany Porter came fourth in the women's 400m and 100m hurdles respectively.
Compatriot Charlie Grice finished sixth in the men's dream mile.
Meanwhile, world champion Dafne Schippers clocked 21.93 seconds as she cruised to victory in the 200m.
"To run under 22 seconds in these conditions is very special for me," said the Dutchwoman.
"After all the Diamond Leagues I need to rest and train a little bit before the European Championships in my country. No more races until then."
