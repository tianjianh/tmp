Boy gives evidence at Norfolk child abuse trial

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The trial of 10 people accused of abusing children has heard one boy, allegedly abused hundreds of times, thought sexual activity was "normal".

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The boy, who cannot be named, said Michael Rogers, 53, from Romford, touched him sexually while in bed.
He described Mr Rogers as "mean" and a "bully" who punched several children.
Six women and four men are on trial at Norwich Crown Court accused of 38 charges of sexually abusing and neglecting five young children.
The boy said Mr Rogers also pulled the fractured arm of a girl to hurt her.
The court was shown a series of DVDs of interviews with the children said to be victims of the abuse.
In the first recording, the boy initially denied anything inappropriate happened to him.
But in another interview in 2012, two years later, he told police that a number of defendants engaged in sexual activity with the children.
"I thought everybody did it," he said.
He also said one of the defendants, Marie Black, 34, from Norwich, was nice, and said nothing else happened that hurt him or that he did not like.
Ms Black denies charges including neglect and ill-treatment, sexually assaulting children under 13, conspiracy to cause children to watch sexual acts and causing child pornography.
In another interview five months later, the boy revealed that Mr Rogers was "mean" and a "bully".
He also said Mr Rogers showed him films with sexual content.
The court heard him claim he was abused hundreds and hundreds of times.
In recorded interviews with police and social workers, he said defendant Jason Adams had abused him two or three times a day from the age of three until seven.
In another account, he said he was abused at a chiropractors and all 10 defendants assaulted him variously at parties and at homes.
Prosecutor Angela Rafferty QC said earlier the five children only began to tell what had happened to them when they felt safe.
The defence maintains the stories are made up and false.
The other defendants, all from Norwich, are Jason Adams, 43, Carol Stadler, 59, Anthony Stadler, 63, Kathleen Adams, 84, Nicola Collins, 36, Andrew Collins, 52, Judith Fuller, 31, and Denise Barnes, 43.
They are charged with offences including rape, child cruelty, causing children under 13 to engage in sexual activity and sexual assault.
All deny all charges, except Mr Adams, who admits four of five child cruelty charges against him.
The trial continues.
