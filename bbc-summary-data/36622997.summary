A 45-year-old man has been arrested in connection with the murder of a woman who disappeared in 1996 and whose remains were found 13 years later.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Melanie Hall was a clerical officer at the Royal United Hospital in Bath and had been at a nightclub when she disappeared in June of 1996.
Her partial remains were found in a plastic bag near a slip road of the M5 in Gloucestershire in 2009.
Dental records were subsequently used to identify the 25-year-old.
The arrested man was taken into custody by Avon and Somerset Police on Thursday on suspicion of her murder.
On the 20th anniversary of her disappearance police revealed they had obtained DNA evidence from an item found at the scene where Miss Hall's remains were discovered.
Her parents, Steve and Pat Hall, also made an appeal for information and offered Â£50,000 of their own money as a reward for information leading to a conviction.
Mr Hall said then: "We believe we're in touching distance of a significant breakthrough and feel it's the right time to offer a substantial reward to encourage someone to come forward with information.
"Someone may have been wavering over whether to provide information for a long time.
"This amount of money is life-changing and I hope it will provide the incentive for them to do the right thing."
A renewed appeal for information was also made on the BBC's Crimewatch Roadshow programme.
This programme led to more than 20 calls by the public offering information.
Police have previously arrested nine people in connection with the case since the investigation began but no-one has been charged.
