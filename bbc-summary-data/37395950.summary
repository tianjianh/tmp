Wales international Cuthbert, 26, scored Blues' opening try, but was later forced off by a groin problem.
"He needs a bit of luck because his work ethic certainly deserves it," said Wilson of Cuthbert after the game.
Blues fly-half Gareth Anscombe came off after the break with a cut head and may be tested for concussion.
Cuthbert missed Wales' June tour to New Zealand after having knee surgery and last played a Test in March, the Six Nations defeat by England at Twickenham.
Anscombe, 25, has made eight Wales appearances as a utility back since arriving from New Zealand side Chiefs.
Wilson added: "Alex scored a great try and was doing really well before he got injured and, fingers crossed, it's just short-term.
"Gareth's cut looks a bit of a nasty one - a bit of an error at the base of a scrum for us that led to it - but he has some stitches in his head and I'm sure it will be a short-term recovery, hopefully without concussion.
"We'll wait and make those assessments at the start of next week."
Unbeaten Blues travel to Zebre next Saturday, hoping to avoid a repeat of the 26-15 reverse they suffered there in October.
