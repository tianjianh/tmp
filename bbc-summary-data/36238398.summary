Chelsea captain John Terry will miss the rest of the season through suspension after his red card in Saturday's 3-2 defeat at Sunderland.

The 35-year-old centre-half will be banned for two games because it was his second dismissal of the season.
That rules him out of Chelsea's final two Premier League fixtures, against Liverpool and champions Leicester.
"It's sad, it would have been lovely to have had him in our last game at home," said Chelsea manager Gus Hiddink.
Terry is out of contract at the end of the season and has not been offered a new deal at Stamford Bridge.
"It's sad, of course, that he was sent off for a second yellow, and it's the second sending-off, which by the rules means he will be suspended (for both games)," Hiddink added.
"I think he (referee Mike Jones) was too close and an impulsive reaction made him draw the yellow card.
"He was too close, for me, and took too harsh a decision."
The former England captain joined Chelsea at the age of 14, made his senior debut at 17 and has won a host of honours with the club, including the Champions League, four Premier League titles and five FA Cups.
But, after 483 Premier League appearances in the past 18 years, he could now have played his last game for Chelsea.
