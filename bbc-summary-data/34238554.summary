Stormont crisis 'causing sense of fatigue' - Institute of Directors

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The political breakdown at Stormont has led to a growing sense of fatigue in the business community, the head of the NI Institute of Directors has said.

Paul Terrington, who is also the head of accountancy firm PWC, said there was a stark contrast with the other devolved regions of the UK.
He was speaking on the BBC's Inside Business programme.
The crisis was sparked by the murder of a former IRA man last month and the impasse over welfare reform.
Unionist ministers have withdrawn from the executive as a result.
More talks to try and resolve it are set to take place on Monday.
"I guess there is something of a sense of fatigue in the business community around the continuing crisis at Stormont," Mr Terrington said.
"My colleagues in the other area of PWC around the UK say their business communities are embracing that whole devolution agenda with zeal and enthusiasm and a real relish to be able to grab more and more powers for decision-making to be able to shape local economic strategies.
"If we run counter to that trend I think it's only to our disadvantage."
