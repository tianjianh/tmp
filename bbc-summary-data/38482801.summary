Llanelli wetland centre reopens after bird flu alert

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A wetland centre in Carmarthenshire has reopened nine days after closing following an outbreak of an infectious strain of avian flu.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The UK's first H5N8 strain in a wild bird was found in a wigeon at an estuary near the Wildfowl and Wetland Trust's Llanelli Wetland Centre.
The centre closed "as a precautionary measure".
But on Sunday it said all birds "look fine" and the animals would be watched closely.
The Welsh Government said it was the first time the H5N8 strain had been found in a wild bird in the UK.
Restrictions were imposed across Britain to keep birds indoors after the disease came to light across Europe, the Middle East and north Africa.
The risk to human health is low.
