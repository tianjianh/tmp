The visitors opened the scoring in the first half with Jason Cummings producing a fine finish from 12 yards.
Morton's equaliser came from the spot, Shankland netting after Jamie McDonagh was brought down by Darren McGregor.
Hibs can wrap up the title next week with a win at home to Queen of the South but they would also require Falkirk and Morton to drop points.
When these two sides met 10 days ago the match ended in drama with the managers of both sides coming close to blows in a pitch-side tussle. There was no animosity between Jim Duffy and Neil Lennon today, though, with the pair shaking hands and hugging when they met before kick-off.
A crowd of 4229 fans turned up for this one and the 2000 travelling supporters were treated to a bright start by their side. John McGinn had a glorious chance to open the scoring after latching on to a knockdown by Brian Graham, but he scuffed his shot just wide.
Scotland international McGinn then warmed the palms of Morton keeper Derek Gaston with a shot from 25 yards.
Hibernian keeper Ofir Marciano did well to parry away an Aidan Nesbitt cross and within seconds the visitors took the lead.
Cummings found space on the angle inside the Morton penalty box and as the home defence stood off the striker he curled a left foot shot into the bottom corner.
Morton midfielder Jamie Lindsay was standing at the side of the pitch waiting to come on after receiving treatment as the goal went in. The home players were outraged but referee Bobby Madden was having none of it.
Graham was leading the line well for Hibernian and was only inches away with a header from a Dylan McGeouch cross.
Morton boss Duffy made a crucial switch when he introduced McDonagh for Michael Tidser. Within seconds of coming on McDonagh drove into the box and was brought down by McGregor for a spot-kick.
Shankland sent Marciano the wrong way for a deserved equaliser for the Greenock side.
Hibernian then had a golden opportunity to regain the lead when Graham was sent clean through on goal by McGinn but the striker delayed his effort and Gaston saved with ease.
Both teams tried to find a way through in the closing stages with Shankland going close with a 30 yarder that drifted just over.
