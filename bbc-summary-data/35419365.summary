Star Wars fans build giant BB-8 snowman

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A brother and sister in the US have made the most of the snowy weather by building a giant snow model of their favourite Star Wars character.

The pair in Massachusetts, on the US east coast, grabbed shovels and a wheelbarrow to make a massive snow pile, and then chiselled it into shape.
They used spray paint and some sticks to complete the droid look.
Their creation has been admired online since their aunt shared the photo.
