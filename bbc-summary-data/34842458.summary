A Leicestershire Police spokesman said: "It is now believed she was in the (Sence Valley Forest Park) area, near to the footpath which leads to the park, off Ravenstone Road."
She was dropped off outside Ibstock Community College, in Central Avenue, Ibstock, at 18:00 GMT on Friday.
Det Ch Supt David Sandall, of Leicestershire Police, said: "Our concern for Kayleigh is growing. She does not have her phone with her and has no way of contacting us, which adds to our worries about her safety.
"We have been trying to piece together her last movements and, we believe she may have been in the Sence Valley Forest Park area on Saturday afternoon.
"I would urge you to get in contact with us if you were in the area between Saturday afternoon and Monday morning. This area is used by a lot of local people, particularly dog walkers, and it is these people I need to hear from."
Kayleigh is a student at Ashby School and previously attended Ibstock Community College.
She is described as about 5ft 6in (1.7m) tall, of medium build with mousey-coloured long hair.
The principal of her former school, Ibstock Community College, David Phillips, said: "We are very concerned about the welfare of Kayleigh Haywood, who was a student here until 2013.
"We are a small school and so every student who has been part of our community is well known.
"We have a strong relationship with Kayleigh's family and this continues.
"As the search continues we can assure parents that school is continuing to focus upon learning as well as giving support to students who are understandably concerned."
A statement from Ashby School said: "We are all becoming increasingly concerned for the safety and whereabouts of year 11 student Kayleigh Haywood.
"If you have seen Kayleigh or have any information as to her whereabouts, please contact the Leicestershire Police incident room."
