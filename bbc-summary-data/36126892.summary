Reading forward Emma Follis: "We are disappointed again, we've come away wanting more and it's just not good enough.
"We need to take chances, especially if they've gone down to 10. We're just missing that last little thing which is so annoying but we've got to take the positives.
"We've got another point on the board. We're still looking for that win but it's just really disappointing. I feel like we've showed we can compete in WSL 1."
Sunderland striker Beth Mead: "It's nice to come away with a point away from home.
"We've gone down to 10 and our team has showed a lot of character and courage to stay in the game, stay involved and try and make chances still.
"I think we managed the game well after the red card. We frustrated them. We were hoping to get something on the break but unfortunately it didn't happen
"My penalty probably was not the best I've ever taken. I just had to stay composed to get it back over the line and it helped the team to get a point, so that was good."
