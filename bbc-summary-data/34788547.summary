A cordon was put in place by police after the discovery of the explosive device in the hollow of a rotten apple tree, which was being removed by workmen at Back Hill, Ely.

They carried out a controlled explosion at the edge of Ely.
No-one has yet been available from the Army or the police to say how old the suspected explosive device was.
The grenade was first reported to the police on Tuesday at about 15:20 BST.
