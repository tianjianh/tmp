Burton Albion 0-1 Huddersfield Town

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Huddersfield scored late on to win at struggling Burton and consolidate their place in the Championship play-offs.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Defeat sees Burton slip to 21st, two points clear of the drop zone, as they lost for the third time in five games.
In a first half of few chances, Damien McCrory and Jamie Ward fired over for the hosts, while Huddersfield's Nahki Wells blazed a free-kick over.
Wells then turned match-winner, heading in Christopher Schindler's knock-back from Aaron Mooy's free-kick.
Huddersfield remain nine points adrift of current leaders Brighton, who won 3-2 at Blackburn, but the Brewers are just a place above the relegation zone as their five-match unbeaten home run in the Championship came to an end.
Ater going close before the break, Ward curled a shot over the bar in the second half.
Huddersfield forward Elias Kachunga saw his goal-bound shot cleared off the line by McCrory as the visitors looked the most likely to score.
But they had to wait until the 85th minute as Mooy's long free-kick was headed back in the box by Schindler and nodded in by Wells for his fifth goal of the season.
Burton Albion manager Nigel Clough:
"We deserved at least a point out of the game. The players were magnificent from start to finish and couldn't give any more.
"We've played well, created chances but just couldn't finish one and then they pop up in the 85th minute.
"We are unlucky not to get the result but we are not disappointed in the performance - it was excellent."
Huddersfield Town manager David Wagner:
"We can be very happy about the three points. We knew that fighting spirit and working attitude would be very important and this is what they have shown.
"The offensive performance was not our best but this was not the most important thing.
"We showed the right attitude and that is why I am very proud of them that they did the right things at the right moments."
