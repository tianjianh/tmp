The body of Sgt Joshua Wikston was found at his home in Mundford, Norfolk, at 9:40 BST on Friday.
The 33-year-old worked as a technician at nearby RAF Lakenheath, where he helped to maintain the USAF's F-15 Eagle jets.
The airbase said it was feeling the "impact of Josh's loss".
Sgt Wikston was a member of the 48th Aircraft Maintenance Squadron.
Col Evan Pettus, a commander with 48th Fighter Wing of the US Air Force, said: "Our thoughts and prayers are with Staff Sgt Wikston's family, friends and fellow airmen.
"We will do everything we can to support his family through this difficult time, and to care for the members of our team who need assistance in the wake of his death."
