Flights between Glasgow and Ronaldsway to resume in May

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Direct flights between the Isle of Man and Scotland will resume in May, it has been announced.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Flights from the island to five UK destinations were cancelled earlier in March, after the "virtual airline" Citywing went into liquidation.
Eastern Airways will operate the new service having already taken over two services to Belfast and Newcastle.
Isle of Man Airport's Director of Ports Ann Reynolds said the renewed link was "very important".
A spokesman for the airline said the company's priority had been "to protect vital routes to Belfast City and Newcastle", but they were now "in a position to link the island with Glasgow again".
He said daily flights between Ronaldsway and Glasgow will begin on 2 May.
