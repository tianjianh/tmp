The 21-year-old sustained damage to his anterior cruciate ligament while training with Slovenia Under-21s.
Stankovic, who joined the Championship side from Borussia Dortmund last summer, has made 12 appearances for the Terriers this season.
"He's quickly adapted to English football and has shown that he has so much to offer," boss David Wagner said.
