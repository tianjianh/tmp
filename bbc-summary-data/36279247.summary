Ronny Deila admits he will have regrets from his time at Celtic, but will never rue his decision to join the club.

The Norwegian manager, 40, will leave Glasgow this summer after two seasons in charge and three trophies won.
On Sunday, Celtic beat Aberdeen to clinch a fifth straight top-flight title and Deila's second Premiership success.
"I would do a lot of things differently, but there are a lot of things I did really well," he said.
Champions Celtic lost 2-1 at St Johnstone on Wednesday evening and have one game to play this term.
Deila intends to make a sharp exit after his final match in charge, Sunday's visit of Motherwell, after which the club will be presented with the Premiership trophy.
He will return home to be with his family as it is a national holiday in Norway.
And while he has not ruled out a return to Scottish football, Deila says he needs a few months off to reflect, recharge the batteries and "get the hungry look again".
He says he has learned from the Scottish game, although has found the amount of fixtures less than ideal.
"I'm sitting here today much more mature, much more experienced - a better person and manager," he explained.
"[I will miss] being part of a club like [Celtic] and all the games, the fans and the intensity that goes into it. I love it and hate it. You're afraid to lose but at the same time you love to win.

"You are really on a high all the time, and so alive."
Deila believes, after 20 years of club football, not having the weekly routine will be strange for him, but wants to take time to carefully consider his next move.
And he joked he might take a job in television as it looks "easy".
"It has to be something that excites me," he said. "It was like that when I came to Celtic. There was no thought in my head that I was not going to do this and I will never regret that decision."
On advice for his successor, he says that very much depends on who it is, their experience and personality.
"I can tell them things but it's like with kids, you tell them but they're going to do it anyway," he added.
"This club is special and they need to understand how special it is and protect it, because everybody now wants to drag it down. They want us to lose.
"It's important we have unity. The players, the staff, the new manager coming - they need time and support.
"If they do that people will grow and they will get the best out of them and there will be a lot more trophies here at Celtic."
