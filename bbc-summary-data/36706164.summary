David Goodwillie says he has not given up on representing Scotland once again.

The 27-year-old former Aberdeen forward, who moved to Blackburn for Â£2m in 2011, has signed a one-year deal at League Two side Plymouth Argyle.
Goodwillie won the last of his three caps five years ago, scoring his only goal from the spot against Spain.
"I don't think about it too much, but as you get a bit older you think 'is it away from me?" Goodwillie said of his international hopes to BBC Radio Devon.
"If you're a player at any age, if you're performing well I don't see why you can't still think about it, but right now I'm just concentrating on club football."
Goodwillie scored just eight goals in two seasons at Aberdeen, and spent the final part of last season at Argyle boss Derek Adams' former club Ross County, for whom he scored once.
"It helps that he (Derek Adams) is Scottish and he knows about Scottish culture and he can put his arm around you," added Goodwillie.
"You're quite far from home and he'll understand that, and I think that was a big decision for me."
Goodwillie was on the scoresheet for Dundee United when they beat Adams' Ross County 3-0 in the 2010 Scottish Cup final.
"He's proven goalscorer, he's a player that has commanded a high transfer fee over a period of time," Adams told BBC Radio Devon.
"He's a very good football player. I think it's important that we take football players to this football club that enhance us on the pitch and he'll certainly do that."
