Kent Police mocked for 'Fred Flintstone' suspect e-fit

A police force has been mocked for issuing the "worst e-fit ever" after the picture was likened to cartoon character Fred Flintstone.

The suspect image, of a man wanted in connection with a robbery, was posted on Kent Police's Facebook page.
But the "extra sideburn" and apparent resemblance to the Stone Age quarry worker attracted howls of derision rather than witness statements.
The force declined to comment on the response.
It issued the image in connection with a robbery of a 75-year-old man in Cliftonville, Margate, on 26 September.
Over one hundred people have shared the image, with dozens adding their thoughts underneath.
Sarah Jane Unsworth described it as "the worst e-fit I've ever seen", while Joe Higson asked: "Did someone at police HQ get carried away with the black pen??"
Robbie Britton said: "By the looks of this you're looking for a guy with a wife called Wilma and a pet dinosaur."
While Jim Pooley warned: "You see the suspect, yabba dabba, don't approach him."
The attack happened at around 10:30 BST in an alleyway between Dalby Square and Athelstan Road, close to a car park.
In its appeal for information, Kent Police said the victim was intially approached by one assailant before two more joined them.
He managed to fight the three offenders off and they ran away, police said.
