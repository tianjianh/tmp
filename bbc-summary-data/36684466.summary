County Championship: Adams in form as Hampshire start well against Durham

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Hampshire enjoyed a much-needed strong opening day to their County Championship Division One game against Durham at Chester-le-Street.

Hampshire, 14 points adrift at the bottom of the table, closed on 319-6 after new opening pair Jimmy Adams (86) and captain Will Smith (67) shared 160.
Michael Carberry, batting at four, made 48, while Barry McCarthy took 2-73.
England all-rounder Ben Stokes, on his return from knee surgery, was named in the Durham side but did not bowl.
For the hosts, in the chasing pack behind leaders Lancashire, a disappointing day that began with asking Hampshire to bat after winning the toss was compounded by the loss of opening bowler Chris Rushworth to a hamstring injury.
In his absence, the medium pace of Keaton Jennings made the breakthrough, enticing an edge from ex-Durham skipper Smith, leading Hampshire in the absence of James Vince on England duty, to end the opening stand.
Adams drove McCarthy to mid-wicket five overs later, but Hampshire continued to progress - Tom Alsop and the recalled Adam Wheater also passed 40, the latter in a stand of 74 in only 15 overs with Carberry.
They took 28 off five overs delivered with the second new ball, but three wickets for 21 runs at the end of the day gave Durham some late solace.
