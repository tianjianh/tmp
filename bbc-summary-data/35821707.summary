The Renfrewshire town, which is bidding to become UK City of Culture in 2021, will host this year's event at Paisley Town Hall on Wednesday 29 June.
The award was developed in 2012 by the Scottish Music Industry Association in partnership with Creative Scotland.
Previous winners include Kathryn Joseph, Young Fathers, RM Hubbert and Bill Wells and Aidan Moffat.
Caroline Cooper, from the Say awards, said: "We are thrilled to be bringing the Say Award to Paisley for the next two years.
"The award celebrates the very best of Scottish music and what better place to hold the ceremony than in a town so steeped in cultural history."
Members of the public can nominate albums on the Say website.
A shortlist will be announced later this year ahead of the ceremony in June.
Leonie Bell, director of arts and engagement at Creative Scotland, said: "We are delighted to be able to support the fifth year of the award and are looking forward to the 2016 ceremony hosted in Paisley Town Hall.
"It is fitting that the ceremony is hosted in Paisley, home to musical talent of Paolo Nutini and the late Gerry Rafferty, as it makes its bid to be UK City of Culture 2021."
Jean Cameron, director of Paisley's bid for UK City of Culture 2021, added: "We are all very excited that Paisley will be home to one of the most prestigious events in the Scottish musical calendar.
"The Say award and Paisley are a great fit - the town has a wonderful musical heritage and continues to be a cultural hotspot for creative talent to this day."
