The party, which won two seats in the 2011 election, is hoping to beat the record seven seats it secured in 2003.

The party saw its membership jump to more than 9,000 in the wake of the independence referendum, which had seen the party campaign for a "Yes" vote.

After publishing its manifesto, the party's co-convener Patrick Harvie said: "We are the only party proposing to cut income tax for those earning less than the average while asking those on high incomes to contribute a fairer share.
