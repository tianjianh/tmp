[SN]TITLE[SN]
Morecambe 1-1 Wycombe Wanderers

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Adebayo Akinfenwa's last-gasp equaliser kept Wycombe's quest for a League Two play-off spot alive at Morecambe.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The giant striker was in the right place at the right time to bundle home the loose ball, after Morecambe's defence failed to clear, earning what could be an important draw.
They dropped to 11th, but remain just a point behind Blackpool in the final play-off spot and within two points of sixth-placed Carlisle.
Gareth Ainsworth's side had fallen behind eight minutes earlier when Morecambe veteran Kevin Ellison scored a superb opener.
Ellison received the ball with his back to goal on the edge of the area but turned quickly and curled a delightful effort past Jamal Blackman from the edge of the box.
The first half saw no goals, but plenty of endeavour from both sides.
Blackman was the busier of the two keepers making three excellent saves from three different players.
His best was a flying effort to tip away Michael Rose's 30-yard drive which was heading for the top right-hand corner of the Wycombe goal
The on-loan Chelsea goalkeeper then did well to tip over Paul Mullin's drive and a low volley from Ellison that was destined for the bottom left-hand corner.
