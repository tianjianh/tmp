[SN]TITLE[SN]
Cheltenham Town 0-3 Colchester United

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Colchester ended their long winless run with an impressive performance at 10-man Cheltenham.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Three second-half goals were enough to secure a first win in 11 League Two games for the U's.
The only serious save of an uneventful first period was made by Cheltenham's Russell Griffiths, who kept out a left-footed effort from Craig Slater in the fourth minute.
But former Kilmarnock midfielder Slater shot low past Griffiths three minutes into the second half after evading several challenges in the box, finding the bottom-right corner.
The visitors doubled their lead in the 65th minute when Kurtis Guthrie set up Brennan Dickenson, who fired a powerful shot into the net from 14 yards.
And Tom Eastman added the third to put the result beyond any doubt, nodding Owen Garvan's corner home from close range three minutes later.
The home side's night went from bad to worse when Harry Pell was sent off in the 87th minute for simulation after going down in the box in search of a penalty.
Colchester gave a start to defender George Elokobi after he was recalled from his loan spell at National League side Braintree Town.
