Band Aid 20: What exactly are they doing now?

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
"You ain't gotta feel guilt, just selfless. Give a little help, to the helpless!"

That was Dizzee Rascal's rap contribution to Band Aid 20, which came out in 2004.
As well as Dizzee, it featured some other illustrious names such as Robbie Williams, Chris Martin and U2's Bono.
But it also had some singers who may have dropped off your radar. The Thrills? Estelle? Lemar? Know what they're doing now?
We take a look at what some of those names, big at the time, have been up to since.
Song line: "And there won't be snow in Africa, this Christmas time, The greatest gift they'll get this year is life."
Jamelia's Superstar was one of the biggest radio hits of 2003.
It won a Mobo award and was nominated for a Brit. But after 2006's Walk With Me, there's not been that much music from the Brummie singer.
Instead, she's become a regular on TV, hosting documentaries and featuring on panel shows.
At the moment she's a regular on Loose Women.
Song line: "Raise a glass for everyone."
In 2004, Justin Hawkins' band The Darkness were huge. They won three Brit Awards including best British group.
I Believe In A Thing Called Love was massive, but by the time their second album had come around, the group's popularity had crashed.
Personal problems in the band were well documented and after 2005's One Way Ticket to Hell... and Back the group went quiet.
Justin tried (and failed) to get into the Eurovision Song Contest in 2007 leaving a lull before a 2012 comeback.
The band returned with third album Hot Cakes, a tour and several festival appearances.
Song line: "Where the only water flowing is the bitter sting of tears."
OK, we know Why Does It Always Rain On Me? became one of THE definitive Glastonbury songs.
As a result, Travis went huge and the album it featured on, The Man Who, ended up selling more than two million copies.
However, by 2004, the glory days of Travis' chart success were disappearing.
Lead singer Fran Healy released a solo album in 2010 called Wreckorder, which debuted at number 76 on the Official Album Chart.
Travis came back with a seventh studio album, 2013's Where You Stand, which reached an impressive number three in the chart.
Line: "Feed The World."
The Bedingfield siblings had successful chart careers in the UK, both getting their own individual number ones.
In 2005, the brother and sister peaked when they performed a duet at the Brit Awards.
For Natasha, songs like These Words and Unwritten saw her have a successful US career.
But recently, there's not been much sign of the Bedingfields in the UK.
Natasha has featured on songs by Nicki Minaj and Ne-Yo while Daniel was a judge on 2013's X Factor in New Zealand.
You probably didn't know that he also has a songwriting credit on Second City's I Wanna Feel.
