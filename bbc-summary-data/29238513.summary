The patient had been outside A&E at Morriston Hospital for between 30 and 40 minutes when she died on Wednesday.
The Welsh Ambulance Service and Abertawe Bro Morgannwg health board have launched a joint review.
They said they wanted "to ensure we have a proper and full understanding of what happened".
In a joint statement, the Welsh Ambulance Service Trust (WAST) and Abertawe Bro Morgannwg University Health Board said: "The emergency department at Morriston Hospital has been very busy with a high number of ambulances arriving in a short space of time.
"Escalation plans have been activated and staff across the hospital are working closely with colleagues from WAST to keep delays to a minimum."
They said the patient had arrived at Morriston from another hospital at approximately 15:05 BST.
"The patient was assessed immediately upon arrival and remained in the care of a doctor and the ambulance crew whilst waiting to be admitted into hospital," the joint statement went on.
"Sadly, at approximately 3.40pm the patient passed away. We wish to express our sincere condolences to the patient's family."
