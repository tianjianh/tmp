A man accused of trying to murder a trainee dentist in an apparent race revenge attack has told a court he "just snapped".

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Dr Sarandev Bhambra was set upon by 26-year-old Zack Davies with a hammer and machete in Tesco in Mold, Flintshire.
Mold Crown Court heard Mr Davies did not intend to kill Dr Bhambra, but acted out of "desperation" and "lost control" when he saw him.
Mr Davies, of Mold, denies attempted murder but admits wounding with intent.
The jury was previously told the attack on 14 January was revenge for the murder of Fusilier Lee Rigby.
Mr Davies said his use of words like "white power" was disgusting and that he would like to apologise to Fusilier Rigby's family for bringing his name into it.
Michael Adebolajo and Michael Adebowale were jailed for life in February 2014 for hacking the soldier to death.
Mr Davies said: "I'm disgusted with myself and ashamed.
"I look back and think 'how can I have done that to someone?' But I did... I feel very bad about it."
Asked if he could have done more harm to Dr Bhambra if he had intended, he replied: "Yes, absolutely. It had already gone too far so I stopped before any more damage was done."
He said he was "absolutely fascinated" with Islamic State and the British man known as Jihadi John, who he described as his inspiration.
The prosecutor put to him: "You are a racist at the end of the day."
Mr Davies replied: "I don't think it is that clear cut. I had contradictory extreme views, especially with my interest in Isis and National Socialism."
The trial continues.
