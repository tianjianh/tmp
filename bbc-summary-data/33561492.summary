Custody death 'due to excess force'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The sister of a man who died in police custody has claimed that officers' use of "excess force" was to blame for his death.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Sheku Bayoh, 31, died after being detained following an incident in Kirkcaldy on 3 May.
His death is being investigated by the Police Investigations and Review Commissioner (Pirc).
In a radio interview, Kadi Johnson accused officers of not following the appropriate protocols.
Criticisms of the police by the family's lawyer, Aamer Anwar, have previously been dismissed as "completely inaccurate and misleading" by the Scottish Police Federation, which represents rank and file officers.
The federation has said that police were responding to reports of a man armed with a knife at the time, with a female officer suffering "significant" injuries during a struggle.
It has also said that the officers involved had never refused to provide statements.
Speaking to the LBC radio station, Ms Johnson said the officers present when her brother died should have been suspended while the investigation into the incident continues.
And she said officers involved in such cases should be compelled to give witness statements straight after the event.
She said: "Excess force was used. Excess force was used, we believe that protocols were not followed, that's why he died."
Asked whether confidence in the police had gone, she said: "Gone, for us as a family, members of the community in Scotland, especially in the Kirkcaldy area where he died.
"The confidence has gone. We are all fearful of the police, and we don't trust in them any more."
Mr Bayoh's family have said they will not rest until they get answers about his death.
Ms Johnson claimed she was initially told by officers that a passer-by found her brother in the street and that they were looking for two suspects.
She said the family became "very angry" when they realised that he had died in custody and claimed relatives were given five different versions of events in a single day.
Ms Johnson told LBC that her brother had never been involved in any previous "problem" and said she did not recognise the way he was being portrayed.
"It was totally out of character, it's like a different person they were talking about," she told the show.
Ms Johnson said it was 32 days before police officers gave statements on her brother's death - something she said increased the family's distress.
"Nobody was suspended. Up to this day, nobody was suspended," she said.
She went on: "If it was in any other situation, whoever was involved would have been suspended without prejudice, and they would have been made to give a statement there and then. So why is it different for the police force, for them not to give a statement on the very day it happened, you know? Why?"
Ch Supt Garry McEwan of Police Scotland said: "I would like to again take this opportunity to offer my condolences to the family and we continue to offer support to them as required.
"An independent investigation into the circumstances surrounding Sheku Bayoh's death is currently being carried out by the Pirc.
"We await the conclusion of the investigation and Police Scotland remain committed to co-operating fully with the Pirc's inquiries."
