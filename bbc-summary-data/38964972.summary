[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
FA Cup quarter-finalists Lincoln remain three points clear at the top of the National League after Luke Waterfall headed the Imps to a 1-0 victory over bottom club North Ferriby.

Manager Danny Cowley made five changes from the side that created history by beating Burnley by the same score at Turf Moor, including a recall for Clarets loanee Josh Ginnelly, who had been ineligible to face his parent club.
Ginnelly added pace and drive to the side, cutting in from the left and striking the inside of the post early on as well as clattering the upright in the closing stages.
But, as at the weekend, it was a corner routine that settled things for Lincoln, as Nathan Arnold whipped in a cross in the 21st minute and Waterfall leapt highest to head into the far corner from the edge of the area.
United came closest to levelling when Curtis Bateson's second-half free-kick curled over the wall and drew a diving save from Paul Farman, but it was Lincoln who had the clearest chances to add to their tally.
Elliott Whitehouse's close-range header, Alan Power's deflected drive and Jack Muldoon's one-on-one chance all came close to extending their lead, while a Ginnelly corner ended up nestling in the far corner only to be chalked off for a foul in the box.
