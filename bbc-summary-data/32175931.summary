A lady was knocked over during the theft in Market Street, Limavady, which happened at about 15:00 BST on Friday. She suffered non life-threatening injuries.
Police have said the officers were nearby when the incident occurred and a 20-year-old man was detained.

"I feel that this is a perfect example of police officers continuing to keep people safe, whether they are on or off duty at the time."
