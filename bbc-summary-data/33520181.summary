[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Mike Leigh's biopic of artist JMW Turner was the most complained about film of 2014, censors have revealed.

Nineteen people wrote to the British Board of Film Classification (BBFC) about a scene in which actor Timothy Spall is seen "clenching" his buttocks.
Viewers felt the sequence, in which Turner had sex with his housekeeper, was inappropriate for a 12A film.
The BBFC said the "very low" number of complaints represented a "tiny portion" of the film's total audience.
It added that the scene was appropriate for a 12A because of "the lack of nudity, the relative brevity of the scene and its importance in terms of narrative".
Spall won a best actor prize for his role in Mr Turner at the 2014 Cannes Film Festival.
Reviewers said his portrayal of the British landscape painter was "part Michelangelo, part Toad of Toad Hall" and likened him to  "a moulting, phlegmy Gruffalo".
The BBFC described how, in the scene in question, his "clothed buttocks are seen clenching vigorously, before the scene cuts to a close-up of his face and his thrusting head and shoulders".
According to the BBFC report, Turner appears distressed during the sequence, which ends with him sobbing "almost in an exhibition of self-loathing."
In its report, the BBFC noted that "context is central to the question of acceptability", and maintained that the 12A certificate was warranted.
The film watchdog releases a list of the films that drew the most correspondence from the public every year in its annual report.
Last year, 12 Years a Slave was the second-most complained about film, drawing 12 contacts about the violence, particularly the sexual violence, in the true story of a free man forced into slavery in the American south.
The annual list is usually dominated by horror or action movies. Batman: The Dark Knight, which attracted more than 300 complaints after its release in 2008, is the most complained-about release of recent years.
In 2012, psychological thriller Black Swan drew 40 letters from the audience, with the BBFC noting that "some complainants had expected to see a film about ballet".
