A diabetic MP who asked Coca-Cola not to take its Christmas truck to Leicester has been accused of hypocrisy for opening a sweet shop in the city.

Labour MP Keith Vaz said Coca-Cola was marketing a "real health hazard".
But Conservative city councillor Ross Grant told the Leicester Mercury that opening the sweet shop in 2013 "put him into the hypocrite category".
Keith Vaz has not responded, but previously said he opposed the way Coke is promoted, rather than the product.
"What we want to do is to make sure Coca-Cola indulges in a proper debate and has a proper engagement with health campaigners, such as Members of Parliament who are part of the All Party Diabetes Group, to make sure that they are much more responsible in the way in which they promote and sell their products," said the Leicester MP.
Public Health England also has concerns about the marketing of Coca-Cola.
Its chief nutritionist, Dr Alison Tedstone, said: "The evidence shows that this type of advertising increases children's preference for and consumption of sugary drinks, which are linked to tooth decay and too many calories leading to obesity.
"Worryingly, children and teenagers are having three times more sugar than the maximum recommended amount and the biggest source is sugary drinks."
Public Health England said evidence showed that restrictions on marketing, advertising and promotion of high-sugar products are likely to be more effective than adding a tax to sugary drinks, along with reducing the added sugar in processed foods and drinks.
Dr Tedstone said: "There is no place for sugary drinks in a child's daily diet - lower fat milks and water are ideal but swapping to no added sugar, diet and sugar free alternatives is fine."

Coca-Cola Great Britain said its Christmas truck would offer two sugar-free variants.
"We're delighted to be visiting Leicester this year as part of the Coca-Cola Christmas truck tour," it said in a statement.
"Our Christmas truck tour also operates in line with our responsible marketing policy so we don't sample our drinks directly to under-12s."
Mr Vaz was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes 13 years ago at a health awareness event in his constituency.
