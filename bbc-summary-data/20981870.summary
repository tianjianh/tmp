[SN]TITLE[SN]
US takes Indonesia to WTO over import restrictions

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The US has filed a complaint with the World Trade Organization (WTO) against Indonesia's restrictions on imports of horticultural and animal products.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Indonesia had put in place strict licensing requirements for imports of plant-based products in 2011.
It also has a quota on imports of beef and other animal products, which the US said has seen "drastic reductions".
The US said the moves were designed to protect Indonesia's domestic industry and were a violation of WTO rules.
It added that the rules had hurt US exports to Indonesia.
"Indonesia's opaque and complex import licensing system affects a wide range of American agricultural exports," US Trade Representative Ron Kirk said in a statement.
"It has become a serious impediment to US agricultural exports entering Indonesia, reducing Indonesian consumers' access to high-quality US products."
The US said it has requested consultations with Indonesia under the dispute settlement provisions of the WTO.
