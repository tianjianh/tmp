[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Gary Whyte's property in Cowdenbeath was searched after wildlife officers were told of tiger claws being put up for sale on an online auction site.
The 50-year-old was convicted under the Control of Trade in Endangered Species Regulation, and has been ordered to carry out 250 hours unpaid work.
He was sentenced at Dunfermline Sheriff Court.
PC Lindsay Kerr, of Police Scotland, said: "Whyte stood to make a significant profit from the sale of these tiger claws, the sale of which is a contravention of endangered species legislation.
"As soon as Police Scotland became aware of the items being illegally offered for purchase online, a robust investigation was launched, which resulted in Whyte being convicted in October.
"The sale of endangered animal parts will not be tolerated and anyone involved in such activities can expect to be dealt with by police."
