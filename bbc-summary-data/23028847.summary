Bristol City FC launches consultation over Ashton Gate plans

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A consultation is to begin for Bristol City FC's Â£40m plans to redevelop Ashton Gate stadium if the club's proposed move to Ashton Vale fails.

The plans will be on display in the AMC Communications Lounge at Ashton Gate on Tuesday and Wednesday.
The newly-redeveloped multi-purpose stadium would be used by both Bristol City FC and Bristol Rugby Club.
The plans for the stadium run alongside another proposal to build a new ground at nearby Ashton Vale.
Although the club has planning permission for the move, it has been held up by a row over a bid for town green status for the area.
A hearing over the bid, which if successful would block any development at Ashton Vale, is expected to be heard by an independent inspector later in the year.
Bristol Sport Ltd, which runs both Bristol City FC and Bristol Rugby Club said it would give them the opportunity to select the most viable option.
Ashton Gate development director Guy Price said: "Since the announcement earlier this year, we have consulted widely with our supporters, many interested parties and our neighbours.
"We are now ready to present the proposals to the public and I encourage everybody to use this opportunity to give us your comments and feedback."
An inquiry into plans for a move to Ashton Vale will reopen in October.
