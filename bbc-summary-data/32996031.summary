The victim, a man in his 30s, was found collapsed in Park Road on Tuesday afternoon following an attack in a nearby scrap yard, Essex Police said.
He was given treatment at the scene but later died in hospital.
Detectives are now looking for two men and say they "urgently need any information from members of the public" in order to trace them.
The pair were seen running away from a scrap yard in Park Lane where police believe the victim was stabbed.
One suspect is described as white, "gaunt-looking", of skinny build and between 20 and 30 years old.
The second man was darker-skinned, an Essex Police spokesman said.
