[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Stones and other missiles were thrown at officers in the Glebetown area.
"This is an extremely difficult and sensitive call to attend for the officers involved," police said.
"It is totally unacceptable that a family who were trying to grieve in a dignified manner, were subjected to having to witness this behaviour."
