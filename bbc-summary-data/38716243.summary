The body of Josh Clayton, 23, from Taunton, was found near Tresco on 23 September 2015, 10 days after he went missing from a party on the privately-owned island.
An inquest into his death was halted after new evidence came to light last week.
His mother Tracey wants police to open a fresh investigation into his death.
She says she has had a private meeting with a senior police officer from Devon and Cornwall Police.
"He assured me he will be reviewing and hopefully will look for any gaps that happen throughout the investigation," she said.
"It definitely wasn't an accident.
"I've thought that from day one and I still believe it now."
Devon and Cornwall Police said they were only made aware of the new evidence at the inquest and were carrying out further inquiries.
The coroner told the force to investigate after new claims emerged of a row at the party Mr Clayton was at before he went missing.
He had been at a staff event at The Shed venue organised by Tristan Dorrien-Smith, son of island landlord Robert.
Partygoer Leroy Thomas said Mr Clayton had been arguing with a group of foreign workers at the party.
Following the inquest Devon and Cornwall Police said in a statement it was the "first time" the force had been made aware of the claims and "further investigations will be carried out as a result".
