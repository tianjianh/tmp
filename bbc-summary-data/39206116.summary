In addition, School Reporters will appear on TV and radio programmes across the BBC's local, national and digital output throughout the day.
A live page on the website will keep across all the latest School Report news as pupils at nearly 900 secondary schools around the country turn their classrooms into newsrooms and work to finish their reports by the 14:00 GMT deadline.
School Report is a BBC project which engages young people aged 11 to 16 in news and current affairs and helps them to make and share their own stories.
In its 11th year, it has worked with hundreds of thousands of young people during its history at more than half the secondary schools in the UK.
