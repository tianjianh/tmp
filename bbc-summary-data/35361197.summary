[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
World champion Kell Brook will defend his IBF welterweight title against mandatory challenger Kevin Bizier in his home city of Sheffield on 26 March.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Brook's third defence of the title he won by beating Shawn Porter in California in August 2014 will take place at the Sheffield Arena.
Brook, 29, returns after missing a scheduled defence against Diego Chaves in October because of a rib injury.
He said: "I've fully recovered from the injury and feel stronger than ever."
Canadian fighter Bizier, 31, has lost only twice with 17 of his 25 career wins coming inside the distance.
His two defeats were against Romanian Jo Jo Dan, who Brook beat in March 2015 in his first fight since being stabbed in the leg while on holiday in Tenerife.
