Harris Tweed Hebrides has secured Â£300,000 from Highlands and Islands Enterprise (HIE) towards its Â£1.8m project.
The company plans to build a new warehouse and dye facility at its mill at Shawbost on the west coast of Lewis.
The firm said it has seen an "upsurge" in the popularity of the fabric.
Chief executive Ian Angus Mackenzie said: "Over the past eight years, we have built a successful and profitable company, committed to continuous investment in its own future.
"HIE's support will enhance the overall level of investment available and will underpin our objective of a sustainable industry providing high quality employment to islanders and an iconic product to the world."
Rachel Mackenzie, HIE area manager in the Western Isles, said: "We are delighted to invest in the company's latest venture which will see many more new jobs created as a result of expanding production space and exporting in new international markets where demand for the fabric is rising.
"Communities across Lewis and Harris also benefit from a strong Harris Tweed industry with tourism, creative industries and food and drink sharing the opportunities for growth that emerge from the vibrant sector."
