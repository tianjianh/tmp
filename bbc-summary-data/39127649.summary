[SN]TITLE[SN]
Strontian's plan to build own school secures funds

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A community group raising money to fund the building of a new school has generated more than £100,000 from a community shares scheme.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Strontian Community School Building Limited proposes replacing a mid-1970s primary school building with a new one on another site in Strontian.
Last year, the group received £50,825 from the Scottish Land Fund to buy a plot next to Ardnamurchan High School.
The rest of the funding needed to pay for the school is to come from a loan.
However, Strontian Community School Building Limited hopes to raise more funds to reduce the amount that it would need to borrow.
Once built, the building would be leased to Highland Council. The local authority has described the project as "innovative".
The new building would be designed in such a way that it could easily be converted into three terraced houses, or another community facility, in the future.
This conversion would happen if Highland Council later decided to construct its own primary school in the village.
