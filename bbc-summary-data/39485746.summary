Celtic: Kieran Tierney won't ask to play right-back before England showdown

Kieran Tierney will not ask Celtic boss Brendan Rodgers for a stint at right-back ahead of Scotland's World Cup qualifier against England in June.

In just his third cap, Tierney, who plays on the left side of defence, swapped flanks for the Scots' vital win over Slovenia in March.
The teenage Hoops star may be asked to do so again by national boss Gordon Strachan when England come to Hampden.
"I'll play where I'm told, no matter who with or whereabouts," Tierney said.
"Working on my right foot is something I do anyway, whether it is with Scotland playing right-back or playing left-back here.
"It is just a weakness I have and something I need to work on."
Tierney, 19, missed over three months of first-team action after sustaining ankle ligament damage and battling to overcome a shoulder problem.
Despite Celtic sealing the Scottish Premiership title in emphatic style on Sunday, the youngster says he will not request time off as the season draws to a close.
"We've not spoken about that and I'm not too bothered - I'd play every game I possibly can," he said.
The defender broke into the Celtic first-team under Rodgers' predecessor, Ronny Deila, last season, ousting established left-back Emilio Izaguirre.
The youngster feels he has become a fitter, more rounded player under the tutelage of the Northern Irishman and his staff.
"I have worked hard every day and I did the same last year, and I hope I've improved as a player," he said.
"I've been lasting 90 minutes easier this season, I've played more games consistently and the training's been a lot harder.
"The manager goes on about my composure and that's improved since the games he watched last season.
"I've got more assists as well, but there's little bits of my game I still need to work on.
"[First-team coach] John Kennedy I speak to on a daily basis about stuff to work and, after training, it is usually him I work with, so he's been great."
At the other end of the Celtic squad spectrum, 31-year-old captain Scott Brown says sustained success has kept him at the club.
The Scotland midfielder, who has made over 250 appearances for Celtic since joining them in 2007, has produced some of his best form this campaign, helping propel Celtic to an unbeaten domestic season to date, and their sixth successive top-flight title.
"That is why I am still here. I enjoy playing, winning trophies and that is why I want to stay here," Brown said.
"It is amazing for all the lads. For myself, to be here for so long to win seven out of 10 seasons has been great but we want to continue to push on.
"We've won the League Cup as well and we need to push on and try to get the Scottish Cup and keep the unbeaten run going as long as we can."
