Some spent more than three hours trapped in the ride's cages on Sunday.
Clive Robinson, from London Fire Brigade, said: "It was slow work as we needed to access each cage on the ride individually."
London Wonderground, where the ride is based, said it was being investigated for a "technical fault".
Twitter user Dannorthover, who had to be rescued from the ride, tweeted: "Finally back to earth. Thank you london fire brigade for the #cherrypicker".
Two fire engines and two "cherry picker" ladders were sent to the scene, where engineers worked on the ride, which has capsules that swing around a central pillar.
Mr Robinson said: "While everyone was very relieved to be back on the ground, everyone had been very calm."
The brigade, which had been called shortly before 18:00 GMT, said there were no injuries.
The Starflyer fairground ride, part of the Southbank's Centre's London Wonderground playground, stands 60 metres high.
London Wonderground tweeted on Sunday: "This evening the Starflyer which shares our site experienced a technical fault.
"Everyone on the ride has been evacuated safely and the company who manage the ride for Southbank Centre are investigating the fault."
The Southbank Centre said it was grateful to firefighters for assisting those trapped, adding: "We will work with the owners of the ride to investigate the cause of the fault".
The ride will remain closed while investigations continue into why the ride got stuck, the centre said.
The Starflyer ride has featured at London Wonderground in previous years and has also appeared at Winter Wonderland in Hyde Park.
