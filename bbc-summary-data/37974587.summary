The 31-year-old, who will have the support of newly-appointed head coach Keith Bertschin, succeeds Marcus Bignot, who left Solihull on 7 November to join League Two side Grimsby Town.
McDonald, who took over the Pitmen in May, leaves them fourth in the Northern Premier League Premier Division.
His first game will be Tuesday's FA Cup first-round replay at home to Yeovil.
Solihull are 16th in the National League after being promoted last season.
McDonald will also be joined at the Moors by assistant manager Nick Green and coach David Bridgwater, his backroom team at Hednesford and his previous club Redditch.
"With my ambitions as a football manager, the opportunity to come to Solihull was just too good to turn down," McDonald told BBC WM.
"Part of the decision to come was to help with my development. Keith has a wealth of experience which will help that.
"But I'm in charge. I have my management team with me, I want to put my stamp on things and carry on the good work Marcus has done in transforming this club.
"It was a tough decision and Saturday was an emotional day for me, but the people at Hednesford understand why I've made it."
Liam McDonald was talking to BBC WM's Rob Gurney.
