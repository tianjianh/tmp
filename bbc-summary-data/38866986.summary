A boat fell off a trailer leaving it beached on a major road in Essex.

The vessel crashed on to the northbound stretch of the A12 between Ardleigh and Dedham near Colchester just before 12:00 GMT.
The Shona Mae had come off the back of a four-wheeled trailer pulled by a grey car.

Although the trailer flipped over, the boat came to a rest upright on its keel. One lane remains closed while the scene is cleared.
