[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Chester's winless sequence extended to six matches as Bromley earned a point from a 1-1 draw.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Blair Turgott shot Neil Smith's men in front early on. The home defence regretted missing multiple chances to clear before the promising 22-year-old curled past Alex Lynch.
Bromley were comfortable in the lead through the break, and had chances to extend it. They rued the missed opportunities when Connor Dymond conceded a penalty with a quarter of the match remaining.
Tom Shaw stepped up to beat Alan Julian, drawing the sides level.
Ryan Astles nearly won it for Chester when he headed Ryan Lloyd's free-kick just over, but defeat would have been hard on the visitors.
