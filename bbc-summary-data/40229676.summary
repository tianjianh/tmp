[SN]TITLE[SN]
Bridgend teacher's 'sex claim' behaviour unacceptable

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A teacher who boasted of sex with a teenage pupil on a school trip has been found to behaved unprofessionally.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The man, who teaches at a school in Bridgend county, now faces disciplinary action by the Education Workforce Council.
But the fitness-to-practise hearing in Cardiff found allegations of sex and sexually motivated behaviour not proven.
The panel will decide on his punishment at a later date.
During a two-day hearing, it was claimed the man had told a colleague that he had sex with the pupil and said: "You know [Pupil A], I've smashed her."
It was alleged the incident took place during a continental trip and that pupils had been drinking in a bar with the teacher.
Giving evidence, the teacher said he did indicate something sexual had occurred to the colleague but said it was "banter... male bravado" and that they were not speaking as professionals.
He said he did use the words "smashed her", which he said he deeply regretted saying.
But when asked at the hearing whether he had sex with Pupil A, he replied: "Absolutely not".
He said he stayed up talking to Pupil A but said there were always other people present - although he accepted it was "inappropriate" and "may lead to rumours".
The teacher's colleague said it was "entirely inappropriate" for the teacher involved in the hearing to be alone with Pupil A and there was a "zero tolerance" of pupils consuming alcohol while on the trip, regardless of their age.
He said the teacher sent him a text that said: "Worse thing is in the same situation I'd probably do it again LOL."
The colleague said he wrote a statement about what happened the weekend after returning home.
He asked for a meeting with the school head teacher and handed over his statement, and the head teacher told the hearing the teacher was removed from his classroom and suspended.
She said she spoke to Pupil A's mother on three occasions and the mother said she did not think anything sexual had occurred between her daughter and the teacher.
While the sexual allegations were found not proven, the fitness-to-practise panel ruled that the behaviour did amount to "unacceptable professional conduct".
