Shaun Edwards: Wales move to scotch Toulon move report

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Defence coach Shaun Edwards is not leaving Wales, contrary to a French website claiming he is joining Toulon, says the Welsh Rugby Union.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Wales management have a reciprocal deal with the French club as part of their coaching team's development.
Toulon fitness coach Paul Stridgeon helps Wales during international periods.
"Shaun is contracted to Wales through to 2019," a WRU statement read.
"The WRU and national squad have a close working relationship with Toulon.
"As normal practice in this environment there is always coaching CPD (continued professional development) and exchange of ideas and experience.
"Toulon coaches have spent time with us and we do that reciprocally and that is the situation here."
Edwards signed a four-year extension to his Wales contract in December 2015.
