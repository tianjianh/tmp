[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Michael Cheek's goal midway through the first half proved enough for the visitors, despite the hosts missing several first half opportunities.
Braintree who have fielded eight different goalkeepers this term and enjoyed a record win in the FA Cup last week, remain in the bottom four.
Mid-table Wrexham have failed to score in ten matches this season.
Wrexham manager Dean Keates told BBC Radio Wales Sport:  "It is disappointing, we had three really good chances. But we weren't brave enough to break them down.
"It is frustrating, we looked positive, but after ten minutes onwards, we lost our tempo.
"We never really got going and it is disappointing."
