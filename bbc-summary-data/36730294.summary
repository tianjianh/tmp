The 36-year-old was a free agent after being released by QPR at the end of last season.
Green, who won 12 caps for England, has also played for Norwich and West Ham.
"This is one of those opportunities where the first call asking if you want to come and play for Leeds is very quick. It was a 'yes' straightaway," he told the club website.
"I'm thrilled to be here. I've spoken to the manager and I know what he's got in store and what he's planning.
"What he said really resonated with me and re-affirmed my feelings towards this opportunity."
