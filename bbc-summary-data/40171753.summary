General election 2017: Last day of campaigning underway

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Political parties are making their final push for votes on the last day of campaigning before the polls open for Thursday's general election.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn will be in north Wales during an eve of election tour of England, Wales and Scotland.
Brexit minister David Jones is campaigning for the Conservatives in Alyn and Deeside and Plaid Cymru leader Leanne Wood will visit Rhondda.
UKIP AM David Rowlands will join activists in Pontypool in Torfaen.
The Liberal Democrats will mainly focus on local campaigning.
It follows visits by Lib Dem leader Tim Farron to Montgomeryshire and Prime Minister Theresa May to Clwyd South on Tuesday.
Ms Wood, who will address supporters in Treorchy on Wednesday, is targeting Rhondda after becoming AM for the area in last year's assembly election, snatching the seat from Labour.
But she drew criticism from senior Plaid figures in April for suggesting she might stand for Rhondda at Westminster and then later ruling it out.
Polls for the general election will open at 07:00 BST on Thursday and close at 22:00.
A total of 213 candidates are standing for Wales' 40 parliamentary constituencies.
