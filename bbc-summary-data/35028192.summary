Extreme or unusual weather conditions are always popular stories on the news website and in January there were four days which racked up millions of  page views.
The most-read story of the year was on 19 January when temperatures in the Highlands fell as low as -13C during the coldest day of the winter.
Other major weather stories were Shetland given amber warning for 100mph gusts on 10 January, amber warnings across Scotland three days later and snow hitting traffic and closing roads on 29 January.
In the final days of 2014, a Scottish nurse returned to Glasgow from Sierra Leone and began to feel unwell.
Pauline Cafferkey spent several weeks in an isolation unit at the Royal Free Hospital in London after becoming the first person to be diagnosed with Ebola in the UK.
Having recovered from the potentially deadly disease, it came as quite a shock when Ms Cafferkey was readmitted to the isolation unit in October.
NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde said the virus was still present in Ms Cafferkey's body after being left over from the original infection.
Ms Cafferkey again recovered and left the hospital in November.
Who says there are no good news stories?
In April, tennis star Andy Murray married his long-term girlfriend Kim Sears in a ceremony in his hometown.
The couple exchanged vows at the 12th Century Dunblane Cathedral before making their way to a small reception for family members and close friends.
The Wimbledon and US Open-winning player was greeted by a huge cheer from the gathered crowd as he entered the venue with his brother Jamie.
In February, a debate between family and friends about the colour of a dress for a wedding became an internet sensation.
Alana MacInnes, of Uist, and Caitlin McNeill, from Colonsay, sought views on Tumblr about whether it was gold and white or blue and black.
On Twitter the debate's hash tag #TheDress was the top trending tag.
Other tags included #TheDressIsWhiteAndGold and #TheDressBlueAndBlack and the much less popular #TheDressIsBlue.
The murder of 24-year-old Irish student Karen Buckley in Glasgow in April shocked the country.
Miss Buckley, from Cork, was reported missing after a Saturday night out and four days later police found a body at a farm on the outskirts of Milngavie, six miles from Glasgow city centre.
Alexander Pacteau, 21, was arrested after the body find.
The 21-year-old later admitted bludgeoning her with a spanner and strangling her in his car before hiding Ms Buckley's body in a barrel he stored at a farm.
At the High Court in Glasgow, Pacteau was jailed for a minimum of 23 years.
Donald Trump's call for Muslims to be banned from entering the US led to petitions saying he should be prohibited from coming in to the UK.
Mr Trump made the comments at the start of December as part of his bid to become the Republican nominee for the US president.
Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon joined calls for Mr Trump to be considered for exclusion from the UK.
Mr Trump, who owns two Scottish golf courses, had already been dropped as a business ambassador by Ms Sturgeon.
He responded to the snub by saying: "The UK politicians should be thanking me instead of pandering to political correctness."
On 4 December, it was announced that the Forth Road Bridge was to be closed until the new year because of structural faults.
Transport Minister Derek Mackay said it would need at least three weeks to repair the bridge and safety was "paramount".
At a media conference, engineers said a 2cm-wide crack in a truss under the southbound carriageway, close to the bridge's north tower, could not have been predicted and happened quickly.
They said continuing to allow traffic to use the bridge would "increase the risk of causing extensive secondary damage to the structure".
A pun by comedian Darren Walsh scooped the prize for funniest joke of the Edinburgh Fringe in August.
The 39-year-old, whose show Punderbolt played at the Pleasance, took first place in the vote by TV channel Dave.
The winning joke was: "I just deleted all the German names off my phone. It's Hans free."
Exactly one year on from the independence referendum Scotland's first minister said that the prime minister, David Cameron, was "living on borrowed time" as he continued to seek to prevent Scotland leaving the UK.
In a speech in Edinburgh, Ms Sturgeon said: "My message to David Cameron today is the same as it was when I met him just after the general election.
"What happens to support for independence in the months and years to come will depend as much on what you do as it will on what we do.
"And, right now, you are living on borrowed time."
Referring to the SNP's landslide general election success in May, also one of the most-read stories of the year, Ms Sturgeon said: "If you continue to ignore Scotland's voice, if you continue to disrespect the choice that people across this country made in May, more and more people will conclude that Westminster simply can't deliver for Scotland."
At the end of October, 16-year-old Bailey Gwynne died after being stabbed at an Aberdeen school.
Cults Academy head teacher Anna Muirhead said Bailey was "very gentle" and "caring" and pupils and staff were in a "state of total shock".
A 16-year-old boy, who cannot be named for legal reasons, was later remanded in custody after being charged with murder and having a blade or point on school premises.
The tragic tale of a car crash involving John Yuill and Lamara Bell had widespread implications, not least for the police who have been the subject of numerous investigations into why they did not attend the incident until three days after it was first reported.
John Yuill had died when his Renault Clio crashed down an embankment just off the M9 near Stirling in July.
But his partner lay critically injured from Sunday until Wednesday and later died.
The force admitted the crash had been reported to them on Sunday morning but had not been followed up, despite the pair being reported missing by family.
This summer's Higher maths examination left students baffled and caused an outcry on social media.
A report into why the pass mark was so low said a bamboozling question about a crocodile stalking its prey was one reason.
The pass mark for the new-look Higher maths was cut to just 34% because the exam was harder than expected.
A report for the Scottish Qualifications Authority (SQA) said the main problem was the overall difficulty of the exam - not individual questions.
But a former principal assessor said the exam was not fit for purpose.
At the start of May there was a political earthquake in Scotland as the SNP recorded a historic landslide general election victory, winning 56 out of 59 seats.
Labour was left with just one MP north of the border. The Liberal Democrats lost 10 seats, with only Alistair Carmichael holding on in Orkney and Shetland.
The Conservatives held Dumfriesshire, Clydesdale and Tweeddale - the other seat to withstand the SNP tsunami.
One of the most barking stories of the year was traffic delays on a busy stretch of the M74 motorway caused by a dog "taking control of a tractor".
The incident took place at junction 13 Abington in South Lanarkshire in April.
It later emerged that a sheepdog called Don, owned by farmer Tom Hamilton, had leaned on the controls of his utility vehicle, taking it on to the road.
Police and Mr Hamilton later recovered Don, who was unhurt, and the vehicle, from the central reservation.
The fatal accident inquiry into the Glasgow bin lorry crash ran during the summer and provided lots of information about the tragedy which took place in December 2014.
Earlier this month, the sheriff gave his determination and found the tragedy could have been avoided if the driver had not lied about his history of blackouts.
Harry Clarke, 58, was unconscious when the lorry veered out of control on 22 December 2014, killing six people.
The inquiry report states that he "repeatedly lied in order to gain and retain jobs and licences".
A family that lost three loved ones in the crash said it would go ahead with a bid to stage a private prosecution of the driver.
