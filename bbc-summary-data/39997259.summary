A sequel to a crowdfunded film about the lives of supporting artists in Star Wars has been announced.

Elstree 1976 was directed by Jon Spira, from Thrupp, Oxfordshire, and completed after a Kickstarter campaign raised more than Â£40,000.
He said a follow-up, Elstree 1979, would focus on the stunt team from Star Wars sequel The Empire Strikes Back.
Filming is due to start this summer with the filmmakers hoping to release the documentary next year.
It is being produced by the Works Film Group.  However, it has not yet been decided whether there will be a second Kickstarter campaign.
Mr Spira said: "Where '76 dealt with the supporting artists of A New Hope, this film will look at the stunt team from Empire Strikes Back.
"Wider than that, we will tell the story of that generation of British stunt performers. We can't wait to start shooting it."
The first film featured Star Wars legends such as Dave Prowse, who played Darth Vader, and Jeremy Bulloch, who played Boba Fett, alongside little known extras.
Elstree 1979 will look at the work of stuntmen Colin Skeaping and Vic Armstrong, and recreate the scene in which Luke Skywalker is blown through a window during the film's climactic duel.
About 1,000 people backed Elstree 1976 on Kickstarter.
