[SN]TITLE[SN]
Oldham Athletic 0-2 Southend United

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Nile Ranger put aside his off-field troubles to help Southend United to victory at Oldham Athletic.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Ranger, who appeared in court earlier in the week, remained in the Southend starting line-up and gave his team the lead before Jermaine McGlashan sealed the win in the second half.
Struggling Oldham created the first chance of the game as Billy McKay's low drive forced a save from visiting keeper Mark Oxley.
But the visitors went in front after 18 minutes when Jason Demetriou's pass found Ranger, who cleverly hooked his shot into the top corner from 12 yards.
Ryan Flynn fired wide for the home side, while Peter Clarke headed too close to Oxley after escaping his marker.
Southend could have doubled their lead just after the break, but Latics keeper Connor Ripley turned away a far-post volley by Marc-Antoine Fortune.
Ripley, however, was left exposed in the 76th minute as McGlashan raced clean through on goal and although his initial effort was saved, he slotted in the rebound from six yards.
The Blues are now unbeaten in 10 league matches, while Oldham have managed just one home win all season.
