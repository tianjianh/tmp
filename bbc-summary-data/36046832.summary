[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The son of the Greggs bakery founder has gone on trial accused of sexually abusing boys over three decades.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Colin Gregg, 74, had a "strong determination to sexually abuse little boys" and there was a pattern to his offending, Newcastle Crown Court heard.
The former head teacher, from Gosforth in the city, denies 26 indecent assault charges relating to nine complainants.
His trial was told how Mr Gregg became a "wealthy man" by helping to expand the family bakery business.
Mr Gregg is accused of molesting boys in his car, at schools where he worked and at home, with the allegations covering a period from the 1960s to the 1990s.
"On the surface, he has lived a life of decency, indeed one of distinction," said Paul Greaney QC, opening the prosecution case.
The court heard how Mr Gregg trained as a teacher and taught at prestigious Durham School and was once employed as a social worker, becoming the head of a school for "delinquent children".
Mr Gregg, a father of three, also worked as the head of the former King's School in Tynemouth and set up the North East Children's Cancer Run.
Mr Greaney told the jury that the defendant's position was that "each and every one of the complainants is telling calculated and deliberate lies".
He said Mr Gregg would claim the allegations against him were "motivated by people trying to win compensation".
The trial, which is expected to last six weeks, continues.
