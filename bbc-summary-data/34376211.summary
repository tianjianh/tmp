Labour views: Election-winning policies

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Jeremy Corbyn has promised Labour members more democracy and a much bigger say over what goes in the party's manifesto - but can they come up with election-winning policies?

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
"We need to think long and hard before we change arrangements that have been pretty successful hitherto. I would probably be on the side of not diving in with both feet for lots of change. I think we are pretty democratic as it is and making further changes I think I would be wary about, to be honest."
Were previous leaders too dictatorial?
"Some elements of the membership will always say that but no, I believe not. I'd come down on the side of saying we already have enough ways to make our voices heard.
"What are the poor going to do if Jeremy Corbyn does not win the next general election? We are looking at 10 years of Conservative government and everything Tony Blair achieved, in terms of tackling inequality and policies like Sure Start, could be undone."
"Party members are members of the electorate. I think they do reflect the populace in general. It's important the party listens to what the members are saying and when they listen to policy I think it's important that's done in a structured way.
"There is a great cry out there from ordinary working people - and people who can't get any work - saying 'why are we bearing the brunt of this?' and so we have got to listen to that and manage our way through it. So it's an important time for us.
"The Labour Party has got to be seen as the party of anti-austerity."
"Conference delegates have been asking for this kind of thing for years. It seems like a change that a lot of people like. The mandate for Jeremy Corbyn's politics is massive."
What about the wider population of non-Labour members?
"If you look at things like rail renationalisation that's immensely popular with members of the public and that's one of Jeremy's staple policies."
"We should be true to our principles and we need to build a movement that acts on what people want - and that's how you do it by speaking to your membership and getting feedback from them on what people want to see happening and I think you will get good policies from that.
"We are going to win the next election. Election-winning policies would be anti-austerity, a move away from Trident and a move towards more community-based work."
"I think it's important to listen to a broad section of society, not just the few. We are going to take our lead from the members as much as the politicians and if we do that we are going to feed into the public. Jeremy Corbyn has been extremely popular because he has stood his ground for more than 30 years.
"It shows real integrity and I think the public are seeing that integrity and it is shining through."
What policies will win Labour the next election?
"Bringing rail back into the public realm, stopping the privatisation of the NHS, stopping this awful employment rights with trade union bill to ensure we don't have zero hours contracts, building industry again, making us a powerhouse in trade again rather than where we are at the moment."
