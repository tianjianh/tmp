Donnybrook hosts the game against France on 26 February and then the Irish take on Wales in Cardiff on 11 March.
Ireland will finish their championship at home against England on 17 March.
"While we had some tough games in November, the experience the players gained in those matches will stand to them as we head into the Six Nations Championship," said Ireland head coach Tom Tierney.
"There is a good blend of youth and experience in the squad, and having had weekly camps since Christmas, we've been working hard getting our structures in place and making sure everyone knows their job.
"The fact that all of our games will be broadcast this season adds an additional element of excitement to the campaign so everyone is looking forward to it all getting underway."
