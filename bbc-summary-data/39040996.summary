South African Kerrod joined the Reds in January 2016 after leaving Eastern Province Kings.
The 24-year-old has made 28 appearances for Jersey, and scored two tries in 12 Championship games this season.
"He is a promising prop and we're looking forward to trying to help him reach the top of his game at Warriors," director of rugby Gary Gold said.
