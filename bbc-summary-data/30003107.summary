The money will be used to extend the project at the Nerve Centre in the city.
It will also assist the development of a mobile facility in the north-west region to "increase outreach".
Culture minister Carál Ní Chuilín said she was pleased to be able to confirm that she had secured capital funding.
John Peto of the Nerve Centre outlined the benefits the mobile facility would bring to the community as part of the City of Culture legacy.
"The legacy is now to reach out to Strabane, to Coleraine, to Limavady," he added.
"The mobile lab will allow us to go out and deliver day sessions in places.
"But also it has the capacity where it can stay in an area potentially for a week, a fortnight, a month and start to embed these skills and build digitally enabled community resilience."
The Nerve Centre says a Fab Lab is a digital fabrication workshop which allows anyone "to make practically anything".
Users have "an unprecedented opportunity to access state of the art digital tools within a community setting".
The Fab Lab at the Nerve Centre is partnered with one at the Ashton Centre in north Belfast.
