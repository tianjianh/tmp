Adams, 58, is into the last four at Lakeside for the 10th time after beating Scotland's Ross Montgomery 5-1.
"The one thing I'm pleased about today is that I hit some doubles without mucking about," he told BBC Sport.
Mitchell, 44, hit six ton-plus checkouts in a 5-2 win over fellow Englishman Brian Dawson.
He will play either Robbie Green or Jeff Smith next, while Adams will take on the winner of the last-eight tie between Darryl Fitton and Glen Durrant.
The two remaining men's quarter-finals and both semi-finals in the women's event will be played on Friday evening.
Montgomery was hugely impressive in his 4-0 success over 2013 champion Scott Waites, which took him into his first World Championship quarter-final.
But it was Adams who made the quicker start to their encounter, winning six of the first seven legs to go 2-0 in front and maintaining control to book his spot in Saturday's semi-finals.
Mitchell's exceptional finishing earned him eight of the first nine legs against Dawson and a 3-1 lead in sets at the interval.
Qualifier Dawson came within one leg of levelling the match at 3-3, but Mitchell landed a 132 checkout on the bull to restore his two-set advantage and reached the semi-finals for the first time in his career.
"The finishing was good there but I still don't think I've played my best game - I've not really scored alongside it," said Mitchell, who lives in Bransgore, Hampshire.
"The Lakeside's been part of my life since I was an eight-year-old. I've been here six times as a fan, six times as a player and now I'm in the semi-finals. I can't take it in."
