The Wales centre-back, 29, began his career at Wrexham and has also played for MK Dons, Peterborough and Preston.
He turned down offers from the Millers and other Championship sides to drop into League One with relegated Wigan.
"He has great experience, having played internationally, but he also knows the division inside out," said Latics boss Gary Caldwell.
"He is a quality defender, a real leader on the pitch who has been a captain, with a superb attitude and we are delighted to have him on board. "
Morgan joins David Perkins and Richard O'Donnell as new signings by Wigan so far this summer.
