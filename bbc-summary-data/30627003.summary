BBC athletics commentator Cram, who was made an MBE in 1986, spent 13 years as the head of the English Institute of Sport, until he stepped down from the post in August.
Under Cram's chairmanship, the EIS has played an increasingly important role in developing sports science and sports medicine for elite athletes in more than 30 Olympic and Paralympic sports, and contributed to the record medal haul at the London 2012 Olympic Games.
"It's really fantastic to have this recognition, especially all these years after I stopped competing," said Cram. "A large part of my journey since then has been the EIS and we have put a lot of things in place to give support to our Olympic programmes."
Another former athlete, Dame Mary Peters, 75, the 1972 Olympic pentathlon champion, is made a Companion of Honour, and Wendy Sly, who won silver in the 3,000m at the 1984 Olympics in Los Angeles, receives an MBE for services to athletics.
The awards include recognition of the success of the 2014 Commonwealth Games.
Burton, who was Scotland's flag bearer at the Glasgow Games, retired after winning judo gold in the 100kg division, while Barnes won gold in the men's light-flyweight boxing competition.
Kate Richardson-Walsh, 34, captain of the England women's hockey team that won silver at the Commonwealth Games, also receives an MBE.
Gordon Matheson, leader of Glasgow City Council, receives a CBE and Jon Doig, the chief executive of Commonwealth Games Scotland, an OBE.
Brendon Batson, 61, receives an OBE for services to football after being made an MBE in 2000.
The former West Bromwich Albion defender, 61, who has been chair of Sporting Equals since 2010, is a major supporter of the Show Racism the Red Card campaign and an ambassador for anti-discrimination body Kick It Out.
Former Portsmouth defender Linvoy Primus, 41, is awarded an MBE for services to football and charity in Portsmouth, while Jim Boyce, 70, a vice president at world football's governing body Fifa, receives the OBE for services to football in Northern Ireland.
David Collier, 59, who stepped down as chief executive of the England and Wales Cricket Board last summer after a successful 10-year spell, receives an OBE.
