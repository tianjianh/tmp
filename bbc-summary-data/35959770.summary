Sadat Ahmed told BBC London's Helen Mulroy his family had to ask to view CCTV footage themselves after police did not act on their requests.
Ms Ahmed, a 36-year-old divorced librarian, was last seen alive at Wembley Central station.
The Metropolitan Police's handling of the case has been referred to the police watchdog, the Independent Police Complaints Commission.
A Met spokesman said the force could not comment on an ongoing independent investigation.
"You have faith in the police that they will do everything they can but they didn't," Mr Ahmed told the BBC.
