NI 1987 State papers: High security concerns for IRA escapees trial

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
There were high-level security concerns at the 1987 trial of those involved in the IRA's mass escape from the Maze Prison in County Antrim, according to newly declassified files.

The escape had happened four years before the trial, in September 1983.
A memo on the file, dated June 1987, reveals the fate of the 19 escapees in what was described as "the biggest escape in British or Irish prison history".
Of these, three were recorded as dead: Kieran Fleming (a life prisoner) who had drowned while escaping from an engagement with the security forces on the Fermanagh border in 1984; Seamus McElwaine, a Monaghan IRA man, killed in a gun battle with the SAS at Roslea, County Fermanagh in 1984; and Pat McKearney, shot dead by the SAS at Loughgall in May 1987.
Ten men remained at large while two escapees; Gerry Kelly (now a Sinn FÃ©in MLA), sentenced to life imprisonment for causing explosions, and Brendan 'Bik' McFarlane (the IRA commander in the Maze during the 1981 Hunger Strike) had been arrested and subsequently extradited from Holland to complete their sentences.
As the trial of the escapees was scheduled to take place in Crumlin Road courthouse in Belfast in January 1987, a meeting was held in Dundonald House earlier that month to discuss security precautions for the trial.
It was chaired by the Director of Prison Security, John (now Sir John) Semple and attended by the governor of the Maze prison and RUC personnel.
Mr Semple referred to an RUC intelligence report indicating that the Provisional IRA believed there were two possible escape options from Crumlin Road prison.
He also considered that the nearby courthouse was vulnerable from an escape point of view.
In reply, Insp Sexton of RUC court security confirmed that police officers would be located in the public gallery of the courtroom while the RUC would search members of the public entering the court.
Mr Ritchie of the Northern Ireland Court Service asked whether the prisoners would be handcuffed in the courtroom and both the RUC and prison authorities agreed that this was necessary.
The meeting debated the mode of transport for the prisoners and the practicalities of transport by road or air.
Major Radford of HQNI (the headquarters of the Army in Northern Ireland), having been assured that if a helicopter was used the prisoners would be handcuffed, agreed to consult the RUC on the matter.
Mr Baxter, the governor-designate of the Maze prison, stated that, on their arrival at Belfast jail, the prisoners would be fully searched while "top risk prisoners" would be housed in a separate wing.
Officials expressed concern that in recent weeks, the prison guard force at Belfast had ceased patrols of the area around the prison, something that was "very disconcerting [in view of] RUC intelligence reports".
It was agreed that the RUC and military would liaise on this aspect.
Other difficulties surrounding the trial began to emerge. A minute from R D Kendrick, Director of Prison Operations, on 24 February, 1987 revealed that "some of the prison officers due to give evidence in the escape trial themselves have criminal records".
Mr Kendrick reported that checks were being made "to ensure the accuracy of this rather disturbing information".
A final note in the file reveals that the 16 defendants were transferred by helicopter to Belfast prison on 21 April 1987.
"They have been dispersed throughout A and C Wings with the seven top-risk prisoners (including Mr McFarlane and Mr Kelly) being housed on the A3 landing," it said.
In addition, Mr Kendrick said, prior to their court appearance each day, all of the escapees would be strip-searched.
The Lord Chief Justice, Lord Lowry refused to allow the prisoners to be handcuffed in the court.
