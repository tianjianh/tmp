[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The family of an experienced hillwalker from Wiltshire who went missing while on a trip to Scotland have been told of the discovery of a body in Glen Coe.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Robin Garton, 69, from Devizes, disappeared on 25 September last year.
Extensive searches were made of Glen Coe by Glencoe Mountain Rescue Team and others following his disappearance.
Police Scotland said members of the public found the body of a man in the Stob Coire Nam Beith area on Wednesday afternoon.
Mr Garton, a former art dealer, set up the climate change charity The Glacier Trust in 2008 to support science-led projects in Nepal.
He was reported missing after he failed to meet up with friends as planned in Kinlochewe in Wester Ross following a walk in Glen Coe.
