Peltier has agreed a two-year extension and Hoilett has signed a one-year deal.
"I've enjoyed my time here up until now and hopefully I enjoy it even more next season. I'm delighted to extend my stay here," Peltier said.
The Bluebirds are poised to sell Declan John and Craig Noone, but have signed goalkeeper Neil Etheridge and winger Nathaniel Mendez-Laing.
Peltier says manager Neil Warnock was his main motivation for staying.
"You can see what he has done since he came in and he wants to have a good go at it next season," Peltier said of Warnock.
"That was a massive influence on me putting pen to paper as I've bought in to what he wants to do.
"I'm definitely looking forward to getting going again."
Winger Hoilett signed as a free agent in October, 2016.
