The Football Association has said the technology could be trialled in the FA Cup in January 2018, but could now begin in the EFL Cup first round.
"The board will consider allowing the EFL Cup to be utilised," EFL chief executive Shaun Harvey said.
Approval for the technology to be used in the EFL Cup could come in May.
Video assistant referees are currently being trialled worldwide, with Fifa president Gianni Infantino keen to employ the system at the 2018 World Cup in Russia.
The technology would only be applied to key incidents concerning goals, red cards, mistaken identities and penalties.
Video technology was used to correct two wrong decisions as Spain beat France in a friendly in Paris on Tuesday night.
