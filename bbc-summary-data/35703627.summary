The Foxes lead the table by three points after Tuesday's draw with West Brom, but will slip to second if Tottenham beat West Ham on Wednesday.
"There are Tottenham and Manchester City in the race to fight for the title and there is little Leicester to fight against them," said the Italian.
"We are confident. Why not win it? Be positive."
Leicester followed up Saturday's late win against Norwich with a 2-2 draw against the Baggies, failing to find the winner that would have put them five points clear despite a host of chances at the King Power Stadium.
"Four points from two difficult matches, it is fantastic," said former Chelsea boss Ranieri. "We are alive and our spirit is ready to fight again.
"I am happy, not that we didn't get the three points because you can't always get the three points, but our performance was fantastic."
Leicester were bottom of the table at this time last season, winning seven of their final nine games to stay up. They have lost only three times in the first 28 games this term.
"We can repeat last season," said Ranieri. "We try to do our best. Today we were not so lucky, but perhaps in the last 10 matches we will be."
