Francis McCabe Jr was injured and there are concerns he may lose an eye. He is in a stable condition in hospital.
It is reported a device exploded as he tried to remove a poster from a lamppost outside Crossmaglen.
It is thought the poster claimed that a second individual was a security forces informer, or "tout".
Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness said the attack followed a campaign of intimidation against people "who have taken huge personal risks advocating accountable policing".
Police set up a cordon at the scene on Thursday while the site of the explosion was examined.
Parts of what is believed to have been an exploded pipe bomb have been taken away for further examination, a PSNI spokesman said.
The Blaney Road and Corliss Road, which were closed for several hours, have now reopened.
Insp Lorraine Dobson said: "I would like to again thank the public for their co-operation and I would reiterate that if anyone notices any suspicious objects in the area, they should not touch them.
"Rather, report it to police immediately."
