Partick Thistle secured their place in the Scottish Premiership and consigned Kilmarnock to 11th place and a play-off tie against Hibernian or Falkirk.

Steven Lawless fired the visitors ahead with a long-range effort against the run of play at Rugby Park.
Kris Doolan doubled the lead in the second half.
Kilmarnock had a strong claim for a penalty waved away when Kris Boyd was pulled back in the box before Thistle scored, but it wasn't to be their day.
The frenetic start provided evidence of the importance of this match for both sides.

But, with the home side fighting to scramble out of the play-off spot, it was they who pushed on early looking for the breakthrough.
Miles Addison, Boyd and Greg Kiltie all spurned decent opportunities in the first 10 minutes.
However, as Thistle rode the storm, they started to look more assured in possession.
David Amoo could have put the Jags ahead on 15 minutes, but the midfielder's close-range header was directed straight at goalkeeper Jamie MacDonald.
The English midfielder took a bad head knock in the process and was replaced shortly after with Christie Elliot.
The possession pendulum started to swing back the home side's way and goalkeeper Ryan Scully scurried to tip a long-range Josh Magennis effort round the post,
Kilmarnock should have been awarded a penalty.
Boyd burst through on goal and defender Gary Miller grabbed his shirt, but instead of blowing for a penalty, referee Andrew Dallas shook his head and waved play on.
The home side were still feeling aggrieved when Thistle took the lead.
Kilmarnock failed to clear a corner and, when the ball fell to Lawless, the winger blasted the ball left-footed low past Jamie McDonald from 20 yards out.
There was an air of desperation about Kilmarnock in the second half, but as they pushed and pushed they were punished by Thistle's top striker, Kris Doolan, who doubled the visitors lead just after the hour.
He found himself one-on-one with MacDonald and held his nerve to slot the ball low past the on-rushing goalkeeper.
Killie manager Lee Clark sounded the bugle after that, but his charges just couldn't find a way through a well-organised Thistle defence.
Sean Welsh almost compounded Killie's misery with the last kick of the ball, but his thundering effort crashed off MacDonald's bar.
