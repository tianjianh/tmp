Irene Robinson's feat started at New York's Radio City Music Hall and has included visits to Alcatraz, Antarctica and Rio's Christ the Redeemer monument.
Ms Robinson, of Poole, Dorset, finished her odyssey in London with a performance on HMS Belfast.
During the self-funded charity trip the 57-year-old travelled 50,000 miles and played 12 gigs.
She has raised more than Â£5,000 for two charities.
She announced her challenge on board HMS Victory in Portsmouth, playing with the Royal Navy Pipe Band Association on 10 January.
The forensic nurse practitioner, who is originally from south London, is raising money for the Royal Navy and Royal Marines Charity and Julia's House, a Dorset and Wiltshire charity that helps children with life-limiting illnesses.
