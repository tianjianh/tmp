It is the second time the executive has met away from Stormont this year.
The last time ministers met in Enniskillen Town Hall.
First Minister Arlene Foster said that meeting away from Belfast showed a "commitment to ensure that local people are not isolated from the political process".
Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness said the meeting "offers a welcome opportunity to highlight all the north west has to offer".
