Wetherspoon Aberystwyth garden shuts amid bird issues

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A Ceredigion pub has stopped serving food in its outdoor area due to concerns over birds.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
JD Wetherspoon put signs on its outdoor tables in the Aberystwyth branch alerting customers food would not be served due to "ongoing avian issues".
The pub chain wants to build a solid roof to protect the area from birds, which can become trapped in the mesh roofing, prompting health concerns.
A spokesman said the presence of pigeons had dropped since the food ban.
The area of netting around the roof was also due to be increased to keep the birds away.
