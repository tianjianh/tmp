The 31-year-old Gloucester scrum-half was sidelined for the majority of the Six Nations after damaging an ankle ligament in the defeat by France.
Both Scotland and the British and Irish Lions are touring this summer, and Laidlaw is anxious to be back playing.
"As long as I have no setbacks... as long as I keep progressing, I will be back as quick as I can," Laidlaw told BBC Scotland.
Laidlaw, who featured in Scotland's opening win over Ireland, left the Stade de France on crutches and missed the victory against Wales, the loss to England and the defeat of Italy.
"I'm hoping to be back in three to four weeks," he said. "I knew I had done something bad when it happened. My foot was in a not-so-good position.
"I didn't know the extent of the injury and, sadly, the scan showed I needed an operation. But the scan also showed I had only done one ligament so I'm quite lucky in a sense."
Scotland will face Italy, Australia and Fiji in June, while the British and Irish Lions will tour New Zealand in June and July, including three Tests against the All Blacks.
Lions head coach Warren Gatland will name his squad on 19 April, and Laidlaw believes a number of Scots have a chance of inclusion.
"I think the Scottish players are in with as much as a shout as any other players," added Laidlaw.
"I felt that throughout the [Six Nations] we were probably consistent and fairly good apart from the England game.
"Individually, there was some strong performances and there's competition for places throughout the squad.
"He's got good players throughout the other nations as well to pick from. They'll need a strong squad to go down to New Zealand - it's the best place in the world to go and play rugby, and a very proud nation.
"It's going to be a tough tour, and a privilege for the players to represent the Lions."
