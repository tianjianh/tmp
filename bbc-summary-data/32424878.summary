[SN]TITLE[SN]
Strathy South wind farm public inquiry to begin

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A public inquiry into a controversial wind farm development in Sutherland is due to begin.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Plans for the Strathy South wind farm have already led to a row between SSE, the company behind the scheme, and environmental charity RSPB Scotland.
It said that it was a strong supporter of most wind farms because they reduced greenhouse gas emissions.
But it said the Strathy South scheme would cause harm to the peatland habitats and the birds they support.
The proposed 39-turbine wind farm would be situated in the internationally important peatlands of the Flow Country in Sutherland.
RSPB Scotland claimed the wind farm could take at least fours years, and potentially as many as 24.8 years, to save the amount of carbon which would be released during its construction.
SSE said the public was being misled by opponents of the scheme, and pointed to what it described as strong local support for the scheme.
It said the project would help pay for the restoration of thousands of hectares of damaged peatland in the Flow Country.
