Bin Laden death: CIA panned for 'live-tweeting' raid on anniversary

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The US Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) has been criticised online for live-tweeting the killing of Osama Bin Laden as if it were happening today.

It has shared details of the mission that led to America's most-wanted man being found five years ago in Pakistan.
But reaction has been largely negative, with one Twitter user calling the move "grotesque and embarrassing".
Others posted memes and gifs of people rolling their eyes and putting their heads in their hands.
The CIA's other tweets mostly concern historical trivia and artefacts.

Bin Laden's death: How it happened
Have we been told the truth about Bin Laden's death?
The leader of al-Qaeda, who was thought to have ordered the 9/11 attacks on New York and Washington, was shot dead at a compound in Abbottabad, in May 2011 after evading capture by the US and its allies for nearly a decade.
Speaking on the fifth anniversary of his death, CIA director John Brennan said the United States had destroyed a large part of al-Qaeda.
Bin Laden had a great symbolic and strategic significance, he told CBS, and it was important to remove the man responsible for the 9/11 attacks.
He said removing the head of the self-styled Islamic State, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi,  could have a great impact but added that counter-terrorism agencies were confronting not just an organisation but a phenomenon, and the challenge would continue for many years.
"I think it has had a resonance, unfortunately, that has appealed to the hearts and souls and minds of individuals who have been misled by their narrative of it being a religious banner," he said.
