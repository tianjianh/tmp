The law provides for jail terms for libel or sedition. Journalists are regularly arrested on "flimsy and superficial" charges, says Freedom House.
State-run Radio Gambia broadcasts tightly-controlled news, which is relayed by private radio stations. Radio France Internationale is available on FM in Banjul.
The government operates the only national TV station.
There were 272,000 internet users by July 2014 (InternetLiveStats.com). Many news websites and blogs are based overseas and some are run by exiled journalists, says Freedom House.
