Wales have qualified for their first major championship since the 1958 World Cup and the Manics, who are hardcore Welsh football fans, admit their anthem began evolving since Wales narrowly failed in their qualification bid for the 1994 World Cup by defeat to Romania.
"It's a long time coming," said lyricist Nicky Wire.
"Definitely there's pressure, World In Motion by New Order (for England's 1990 World Cup campaign) is the best one, that's the benchmark.
"We wanted to make a great Manics song first and I think we pulled it off. If the song takes off on the terraces, there's not going to be many more finer moments than that."
Wales, who play Sweden in a friendly on Sunday, begin their Euro 2016 campaign against Slovakia in Bordeaux on Saturday, 11 June before facing England and Russia in Group B.
The Manic Street Preachers, whose songs 'If You Tolerate This Your Children Will Be Next' and 'The Masses Against the Classes' have been UK number ones, are currently touring celebrating the 20th year of their acclaimed album 'Everything Must Go'
Catch up with a BBC Radio Wales special of the making of the Manics Welsh Euro 2016 anthem 'Inside the Manics' #Euro2016 anthem.'
