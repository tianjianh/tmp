[SN]TITLE[SN]
Port of Grangemouth workers to take strike action

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Workers at Scotland's largest container port are to begin a two-week strike on Tuesday in a dispute over rotas and pay.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The union Unite said all but two of 75 "operatives" based at the Port of Grangemouth had voted for action in a ballot.
The workers include crane drivers and loaders.
It is understood that about 20 engineers who are also based at the site are not involved in the action.
The strike is due to start at 00:01 on Tuesday.
Unite said the action had been called after port owner Forth Ports announced changes to shifts.
The union said the new rotas, which affect night shifts and weekend work, amounted to "a de facto pay cut".
Forth Ports has yet to comment on the action.
A Unite official said: "We are ready and prepared to negotiate with management."
Grangemouth currently handles more than 150,000 containers annually, with daily sailings to Rotterdam, Antwerp, Felixstowe and Hamburg.
