Caterham Bourne: Funding bid for £4.9m flood scheme drawn up

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A funding bid for a £4.9m flood prevention scheme is being drawn up after areas of south London and Surrey were flooded earlier this year.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Homes had to be evacuated and areas of Croydon, Whyteleafe and Woldingham near the A22 were under water when the Caterham Bourne flooded in February.
A "major incident" was declared in Kenley, Purley and South Croydon.
Sandbags and pumps had to be installed to divert flooding away from water treatment works in Godstone Road.
Tandridge District Council said it was working with Surrey County Council to submit a joint £4.2m funding bid to the Coast to Capital Local Enterprise Partnership, with the county council providing £700,000 match funding.
The money will pay for new drainage from junction six of the M25 via Wapses Lodge to the Croydon border.
It will also pay for resurfacing the A22 between Oxted Road and Wapses Lodge and footpaths from Wapses Lodge to New Barn Lane.
During the floods four emergency reservoirs were built on fields in Woldingham to slow and divert the Caterham Bourne river.
Two permanent water storage areas have now been installed with control sluice gates and a third is planned between Stuart Road and Bug Hill subject to agreement with the landowner.
Woldingham Road has been resurfaced and a new flood relief pipe system installed under the road.
The councils will find out if their funding bid has been successful in February 2015.
If so, work on the scheme will start next summer.
