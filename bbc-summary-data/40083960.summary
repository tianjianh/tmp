The 43-year-old Pavey, who was fourth at the British 10,000m trials, finished the road race in 32 minutes 57 seconds.
Sonia Samuels equalled her personal best as she was second in 33:18 and Charlotte Purdue was third in 33:32.
Butchart, 25, eased to a comfortable victory as he won for a second successive year in 29:18.
The Dunblane runner, who was sixth in the Olympic 5,000m final in Rio, competed in London having just returned from finishing eighth in Friday's Diamond League 5,000m in Eugene, Oregon.
Pavey, a former European 10,000m champion and a World Championship and Commonwealth Games bronze medallist, has not given up hope of making the team for the 2017 Worlds in London.
"I'm still going for the World Championships," Pavey said afterwards. "I've got the qualifying time but I think I've got to prove to the selectors in the next few weeks that I'm worth that place. There are lot of very good girls around and it won't be easy."
Butchart also had his eye on the summer's showpiece occasion, saying: "The crowds were about eight deep in spots and they created a wall of sound and that just gave me a glimpse into what London will be like this summer.
"I know everyone will be focused on Mo [Farah] and it will be much easier for me because I'm just an underdog. That said, nobody is invincible but it's obviously going to be very tough.
"It's Mo's last races on the track and that's going to be an emotional occasion but could I get into the medals, you've got to have confidence."
