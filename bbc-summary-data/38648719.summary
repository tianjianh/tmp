[SN]TITLE[SN]
Why are there going to be elections in Northern Ireland?

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
There are going to be elections in Northern Ireland after arguments between the two biggest political parties in the country.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The vote will take place on 2 March 2017.
In Northern Ireland the government must be shared between two different political parties.  The First Minister and Deputy First Minister lead the government - one representing each party.
Although they have different job titles, they basically have the same powers and must work together.  Up until now the government has been run by the DUP - or Democratic Unionist Party - and Sinn Féin.
The argument between the parties is about whether the First Minister Arlene Foster - the leader of the DUP - ran things badly or not.
The Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness, from Sinn Féin, says she did and he left his job because of this disagreement.
His party refused to appoint anyone else to the job and that means new elections have to take place.
The last Northern Ireland Assembly election was in May 2016 - the DUP and Sinn Féin got lots more votes than the other parties.
After the new election, the parties will have talk to each other again and try to work out how they will share power in the future.
