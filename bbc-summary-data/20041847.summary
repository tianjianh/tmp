Uruguay country profile

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Uruguay has traditionally been more affluent than other countries in South America, and is known for its advanced education and social security systems and liberal social laws.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
It was the first nation in Latin America to establish a welfare state, maintained through relatively high taxes on industry, and developed a democratic tradition that earned it the sobriquet "the Switzerland of South America".
But economic and political turmoil, in particular left-wing urban guerrilla attacks in the early 1970s, led the government of the day to suspend the constitution and launch a period of repressive military rule that lasted until 1985.
Since the restoration of democratic government, successive governments have liberalised the economy. Colonial towns, beach resorts and a year-round mild climate have contributed to a growing tourist industry.
Population 3.4 million
Area 176,215 sq km (68,037 sq miles)

Life expectancy 74 years (men), 81 years (women)

President: Tabare Vazquez
Mr Vazquez's decisive victory in the 2014 run-off presidential election over right-wing challenger Luis Lacalle Pou cemented left-wing rule for another five years.
A cancer doctor by profession, Tabare Vazquez served as president in 2005-2010, being succeeded by his party colleague Jose Mujica. Uruguayan presidents do not serve consecutive terms.
Mr Vazquez pledged to focus more attention on improving education standards and fighting crime, while maintaining the generous social welfare policies of Mr Mujica.
Uruguayans can access a wide range of views via hundreds of privately-owned media outlets.
The state of media freedom is healthy and the UN has praised broadcasting legislation as being "exemplary".
