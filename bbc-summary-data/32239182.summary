Election 2015: UKIP wants to scrap the so-called 'tampon tax'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
UKIP has announced that it will scrap the "tampon tax" on women's sanitary products, if the party is elected.

At the moment women's sanitary items are classed as a "non-essential luxury" item by the treasury and are taxed at 5%.
UKIP's head of policy Suzanne Evans says it's "outdated and outrageous".
"Under EU rules no item that has ever had VAT on can have it removed completely," she said.
"This shows not only how ridiculous EU legislation is, but how very wrong it is that we've given our tax sovereignty over to a bunch of faceless, and mostly, male EU  commissioners.
"The rules are so daft, that you can go for a swim without paying any VAT, but you'll be charged for it on the tampon you need to wear in order to go for a swim.  It's plain stupid.
"Only by leaving the EU can this change, and only UKIP wants this to happen."
Back in 2000, the VAT on tampons and sanitary towels was dropped from 17.5% to 5% after a campaign by Labour MP Dawn Primarolo.
"Taxing tampons is straight out of the dark ages. It is a hangover from a distant past when policymakers disregarded the interests and health of woman and it must not be allowed to continue," said Suzanne Evans.
Earlier this year, a petition was set up calling for an end to the 5% tax.
"They are essential because without them, those who menstruate would have no way of pursuing a normal, flexible, public or private life and would be at risk of jeopardising their health," said organiser Laura Coryton in February.
In her campaign, Laura points to tax-exempt products, which include "edible sugar flowers", "alcoholic jellies" and "exotic meats including crocodile and kangaroo".
She acknowledges the problems posed by EU legislation but says "with the backing of Westminster, we hope to convince the European Parliament this is an important issue worth revising".
One student from the University of East Anglia asked David Cameron about the issue in a live TV appearance on Sky News in February.
"This is a long-standing campaign. I have had a look at it in the past.  It's quite difficult," said Cameron.
"Some VAT things you can change. Other VAT things, if they're linked to other products, it's quite difficult to do it within the framework of European laws and I can't remember the answer.
"I think it's very difficult to do but I'll have to go away and have a look and come back to you."
The Conservatives stand by what David Cameron said in February that it will try to keep the tax at the lowest rate possible within the EU.
Plaid Cymru has also said it wants to scrap tampon tax in its manifesto.
Labour, SNP and the Green Party have yet to comment.
