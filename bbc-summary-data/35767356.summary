[SN]TITLE[SN]
Bruton hit-and-run death pair guilty of conspiracy to pervert the course of justice

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Two people have been found guilty of conspiracy to pervert the course of justice after an 84-year-old man was killed by a hit-and-run drink driver.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Robert Finlay, 48, had admitted causing death by careless driving while under the influence of alcohol earlier in the trial at Taunton Crown Court.
Felicity Wheeler, 31, of Rickhayes in Wincanton and Joseph Breen, 38, of Crowmarsh Gardens, south-east London, had denied the conspiracy charge.
They will be sentenced at a later date.
The victim, David Hick, was found with fatal head injuries on Cole Road in Bruton on 14 October 2014.
The trial heard Mr Hick, a retired engineer, was walking his dogs to the local shop when he was hit by a car.
Finlay, also of Rickhayes in Wincanton, had drunk seven pints of beer with Breen that afternoon prior to the crash.
Within days Finlay and his partner Wheeler had bought another car and the Chrysler Voyager involved in the crash was not seen again on their drive.
Judge James Patrick adjourned sentencing until the week beginning April 19.
Wheeler and Breen have been released on bail.
