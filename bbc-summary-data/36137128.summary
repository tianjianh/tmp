The Asia-focused bank reported pre-tax profits of $589m for the January to March period.
Although that was down from a $1.4bn profit a year earlier, it compared with a loss of $4.05bn in the final quarter of 2015.
Standard Chartered was the biggest riser on the FTSE 100, with the index up 23.6 points at 6,284.52.
Investors were cheered by signs that the number of bad loans at the bank had fallen.
Standard Chartered said losses from impaired loans were $471m in the January to March period, compared with $1.13bn in the previous quarter.
The bank's chief executive, Bill Winters, said: "Although trading conditions in the first quarter remained challenging, we continue to make good progress on our strategic objectives."
In November last year, Standard Chartered said it would raise $5.1bn and cut 15,000 jobs by 2018 as part of a turnaround plan.
