France rose above Wales in the table with England clinching the Grand Slam.
Wales held an early 13-0 lead through a try from number eight Aled Ward and eight points from fly-half Ben Jones.
A yellow card for full-back Rhun Williams allowed France to score 14 points with the extra man before half-time as the home side dominated.
Wales coach Jason Strange had made four changes from the side that defeated Ireland and it appeared to have paid dividends.
The visiting side opened the scoring after three minutes with a try from Ward after a fine run from fly-half Jones who also slotted the conversion and kicked two penalties.
Cardiff Blues full-back Williams was shown a yellow card for a high tackle on French hooker Etienne Fourcade and the hosts took advantage with two tries in as many minutes just before half-time.
The dominant French scrum allowed scrum-half Baptiste Couilloud to dive over with fly-half Romain Ntamack converting.
Ntamack, son of former France wing Emile, produced an impressive individual try by collecting his own chip to score a try which he is also converted to give the home side a 14-13 interval lead.
Another son of a former famous French international scored the third try with number eight Alexandre Roumat crossing which Ntamack converted. Roumat is the son of former French lock Olivier.
Centre Pablo Arrate clinched the bonus point, full-back Geoffrey Cros sprinted over before Theo Millet scored the sixth try.
Wales gained a consolation try through replacement Arwel Robson but it was too little too late.
It was a second defeat for Wales in the tournament with the side now turning their attention to the World Rugby Under-20 Championships in Georgia this summer.
