Champions League: Linfield in line for Celtic showdown

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Linfield will face Scottish giants Celtic if they beat SP La Fiorita in the first qualifying round of the Champions League.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Blues host San Marino side La Fiorita at Windsor Park on 27/28 June with the return leg on 4/5 July.
In the Europa League qualifiers Crusaders take on Latvians FK Liepaja and Ballymena meet Odd BK of Norway.
Coleraine's opponents FC Haugesund are also from Norway while Derry City go up against FC Midtjylland of Denmark.
The Europa League first qualifying round games will be played on 29 June and 6 July.
If the Blues progress they will play the 1967 European Cup winners in Belfast on 11/12 July with the second leg at Celtic Park on 18/19 July.
The 11/12 July date is problematic as it coincides with the 'Twelfth' marches in Northern Ireland and an alternative arrangement is likely to be sought.
It would be a first meeting between the Blues and Celtic.
Celtic defeated Irish League opposition in Belfast four years ago with a 3-0 win over Cliftonville in a Champions League qualifier.
