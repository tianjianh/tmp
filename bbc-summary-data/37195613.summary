Bilic said personal terms have been agreed with the Italian as well as a deal with Juventus, which is reported to be a club record Â£24m.
Zaza, 25, joined the Turin club in 2015 and scored eight goals in 24 games.
"The Zaza situation looks very likely to happen and should happen today, and as far as I know the deal is agreed between the clubs," Bilic said.
"The personal terms are also agreed and he is due in London today, so we hope it will be done."
Zaza was part of the Italy squad which reached the quarter-finals of Euro 2016 but missed a penalty in their shootout defeat against Germany.
Bilic added: "It's very positive and it's a boost. We've been trying for a long time now to get a top-quality striker and he was always mentioned."
The Croat has made clear his desire to sign a new striker this summer following injuries to Andy Carroll and club record signing Andre Ayew.
