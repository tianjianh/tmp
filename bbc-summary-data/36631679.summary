Defender McAuley touched home Gareth Bale's left-wing 75th-minute cross.
"We are disappointed in the manner we lost and Gareth didn't deserve that because he has been excellent. We lay no blame on him at all," said Davis.
"We are devastated to be out but it's been a great journey and we have learned a lot from the experience."

The Southampton midfielder added that there was "not a lot in the game" in Paris, which saw Wales book a place in the last eight of the tournament.
"We put everything into it and had the better chances in the first half but it wasn't meant to be our day.
"The fans were magnificent again and they have enjoyed the journey as much as us. We are just sad to see it end."
NI manager Michael O'Neill believed his side "were the better team on the day" but to lose was "very, very disappointing".

"We gave everything and I couldn't ask any more of the players over the whole tournament.
"Gareth knows it's one of those balls across the box where he has to make a decision and he opted to touch it, which is always a risk.
"It was difficult for him to assess the situation, whether there was anyone behind him or not.
"It's a shame for him but Gareth has been magnificent for me throughout this tournament and throughout my time as manager."
The Northern Ireland squad will receive an official homecoming in Belfast on Monday evening.
