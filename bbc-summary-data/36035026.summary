An investigation has begun into the death of Matthew Drummond, 28, at about 14:30 BST on 8 April in farmland off Heywood Old Road in Middleton, Greater Manchester.
A 67-year-old man was also injured but has since been released from hospital after treatment.
Mr Drummond's family said they were "devastated" by his death.
In a statement, they said he was a "loving dad to his children and a fantastic husband, son and brother".
"Matthew refused to grow up, he was always the joker and he loved life. We will all miss him forever.
"He was always happy to be working with machines and we take some comfort from the fact that he died doing what he loved."
