"Let us rise to that challenge and seek to ensure that unionism still returns a majority of unionist MPs to Westminster and puts the notion of a divisive and destabilising border poll off the agenda for generations to come."
Mrs Foster refused to say if she would stand aside as a nominee for first minister - as demanded by Sinn FÃ©in - until an inquiry over the renewable heating scandal has reported.

The manifesto also says the party will:
