The Â£7.2m project is taking place at the Northam Road Bridge and Billy Mill Roundabout junctions of the A1058 Coast Road which is used by about 45,000 vehicles a day.
The diversion of underground cables is being carried out during off-peak hours with no delays expected during peak periods, North Tyneside Council said.
Main works will begin next year with a completion date of 2017.
