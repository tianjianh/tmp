Lewis Hamilton says he has "nothing to lose" in Sunday's Brazilian Grand Prix, as he attempts to stop Mercedes team-mate Nico Rosberg clinching the title.

German Rosberg, who has a 19-point advantage, will seal the championship if he is victorious at Interlagos, where he has won the past two seasons.
The Briton has never won in Brazil but clinched his first title here in 2008.
"I have had lots of experiences here. It's tough to come here and win, that's the goal," said the world champion.
"I don't really know why I have not won here.
"It is the right time to right that wrong and make that change. I have worked hard to prepare training-wise and at the factory. I feel the best prepared here than I have in any of the last 10 years and I hope that shows in the results."
On his position in the championship, the 31-year-old added: "There is no real point thinking about it. I know what I have to do.
"My goal is to try to win these last two races. There will be some things out of my hands and there have been this year.
"I don't know what's going to happen but as long as I leave these two races knowing I drove my best, that will have to be enough for me."
Rosberg said he just needed to do a "good job" this weekend.
He said: "I love the track. It is a great track. It feels good. I have always gone well here.
"I have great memories from those two wins but, at the same time, we all start from zero this weekend.
"I am feeling great, of course, because it is awesome to be fighting for the world championship with two races to go. I am looking forward to it and of course trying to go for the win."
In dry conditions, Mercedes would be expected to dominate but wet weather could bring other teams into play, particularly Red Bull, and rain is forecast for the race on Sunday.
Red Bull's Daniel Ricciardo said: "It looks like it will be potentially wet, which would make it interesting. There is less pressure on the rest of us. If there is an opportunity, we go for it. It will be fun and we'll see how it pans out on Sunday."
Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel added: "This place has always delivered special races. I don't know what it is.
"The circuit is good fun to drive - it is the atmosphere, the weather. I am sure we will have a great race. The rest of us not fighting for the world championship are fighting for the victory. In mixed conditions, there is always a chance."
McLaren driver Jenson Button said: "If it's wet, it mixes things up. Lewis knows he's really good in the wet and can make a big points score.
"Nico knows there's a lot more to lose. I'm sure Nico wants it to be dry. But everyone watching wants it to be wet."
Vettel, Ricciardo and the other Red Bull driver, Max Verstappen, all said they would "respect" the fact Hamilton and Rosberg had the championship at stake but would race them as hard as ever.
