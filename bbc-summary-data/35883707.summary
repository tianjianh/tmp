Tovey, 26, who can play at full-back and centre, has spent most of his professional career with the Dragons.
Glasgow Warriors, meanwhile, have signed BT Sport Scottish Rugby Academy players Scott Cummings, James Malcolm and Nick Grigg on professional deals.
Second-row Cummings, 19, has signed for three years, hooker Malcolm, 21, for two and centre Grigg, 23, for one.
Cummings, the Scotland Under-20s captain, made his debut for the Warriors against Scarlets in the season opener and has gone on to make nine appearances.
Glasgow-born Malcolm has been part of the Academy for the last two years and has played 11 times for Glasgow this season.
He scored his first try for the club on his first start against Scarlets in the European Rugby Champions Cup win at Scotstoun in December 2015.
Grigg joined the Academy in pre-season having signed from Petone RFC in New Zealand and made his Warriors debut as a substitute in Friday's 12-6 win over Leinster.
He has played in the World Rugby Sevens Series for Scotland 7s in Wellington and Sydney as well as featuring for Stirling County in the BT Premiership. His grandfather is from Ayrshire.
Glasgow Warriors head coach Gregor Townsend said: "With Scott, James and Nick all earning professional contracts, that brings the total number of academy players graduating to full professional contracts up to 11 within the last couple of years.
"I'd like to acknowledge the excellent work of the staff in the Glasgow/West BT Sport Scottish Rugby Academy."
