[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The vice-chancellor of Aberystwyth University will step down in 2016, she has announced.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Prof April McMahon was appointed to the role on a five-year term in August 2011.
She has informed the university's chancellor she wants to step down at the end of her term in July 2016.
During her tenure, she refuted allegations that the university was being run "like a dictatorship" following staff suspensions.
Prof McMahon said she was making the announcement now "to allow for an orderly handover and for succession planning".
She said she was "immensely proud" of the work she had done, adding it had been a "pleasure and a privilege to serve and lead" the university and to work through "the difficulties we have had to confront".
Chancellor Sir Emyr Jones Parry said: "I am deeply grateful to the vice-chancellor for her positive contributions to Aberystwyth University over these past years, and for her consideration in giving early notice of her intentions so we can ensure the best possible handover.
"Personally, and on behalf of the council, I wish her every success in the future."
