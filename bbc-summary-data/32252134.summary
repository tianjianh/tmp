Glan Clwyd Hospital work prompts temporary changes

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Health services at Denbighshire's Glan Clwyd Hospital are being moved to allow the next phase of a multimillion pound upgrade.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A new critical care unit is due to open in July as part of the Â£77m modernisation which began four years ago at the hospital in Bodelwyddan.
A new emergency unit and nine operating theatres have already opened.
In the autumn the main entrance will re-open with a new discharge lounge and reception.
There will also be a new urology day unit and fracture and orthopaedic clinic.
Bosses say there will be "intricate temporary relocations" to allow for the work.
The temporary current front entrance (Entrance C) will switch to the ward 14 entrance with the discharge area moved to the North Wales Cancer Treatment Centre.
Therapies services are being moved permanently to Rhyl's Royal Alexandra Hospital which is also being modernised.
