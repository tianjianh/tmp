The first official photo of the new Great British Bake Off line-up has been released by Channel 4.
Paul Hollywood is the only star who's stayed with the show, while Prue Leith is replacing Mary Berry.
Taking over presenting duties from Mel and Sue are Sandi and Noel.
Comedian and writer Sandi Toksvig currently presents the quiz shows Fifteen to One and QI.
Noel Fielding is also a comedian, who has starred in several comedy shows. He played Ed Banger in the Horrid Henry movie.
The new series of Bake Off is expected to start later this year.
It was announced that the BBC lost the baking competition to Channel 4 last September.
