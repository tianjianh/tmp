Two men have appeared in court in connection with raids on two cannabis farms in West Lothian.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Police said more than Â£600,000 worth of the drug had been recovered from business premises in a "large-scale" operation to tackle organised crime.
The operation targeting industrial units in Kirkton Campus, Livingston, and in nearby Polbeth.
Pawel Sliwinski, 33, and Grzegorz Korinth, 43, were both charged with drugs offences.
Police said about 800 cannabis plants had been seized.
Detectives also searched business premises in Ratho, near Edinburgh.
Both accused appeared on petition before sheriff Michael Fletcher at Livingston Sheriff Court on Thursday.
Neither made any plea or declaration and the case against them was continued for further inquiries.
Mr Korinth, from the West Midlands, who was charged with two counts of producing and supplying a controlled drug, was remanded in custody.
He is expected to make a second appearance in a week's time to be fully committed for trial.
Mr Sliwinski, from Livingston, who faces one charge under each section of the Misuse of Drugs Act, was released on bail. No date was set for a second appearance in his case.
