An author from Gwynedd is among those on the shortlist for the prize for young writers from across the world.
Alys Conran, from Bangor, is joined by Anuk Arudpragasam, Luke Kennard, Fiona McFarlane, Sarah Perry and Callan Wink.
The winner is announced at Swansea University's Great Hall on 10 May ahead of International Dylan Thomas Day on 14 May.
The Dylan Thomas Prize is open to writers in the English language aged 39 and under.
Chairman of the judging panel, Prof Dai Smith of Swansea University, said: "From a deeply impressive long list of 12 works of literature from across the globe, the judges, after a lengthy discussion, decided on six works whose sheer quality, originality and dazzle factor stood out."
Last year, it was won by Max Porter for his work Grief is the Thing with Feathers.
