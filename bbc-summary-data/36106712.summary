[SN]TITLE[SN]
Brain-damaged girl awarded nearly £8m for hospital negligence

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A teenager has been awarded damages and compensation of nearly £8m after she was left brain-damaged at birth.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Worcestershire Acute Hospitals NHS Trust admitted the failings in her care shortly after her birth.
The girl, known as X during legal proceedings, is now dependent on others for daily activities, said her lawyers Davies and Partners Solicitors.
The trust, which admitted liability, said it offered its "profound apologies" to the teenager.
The girl was born by Caesarean section due to concerns she was not growing in the womb.
Following her birth she was admitted to Worcestershire Royal Hospital's neonatal intensive care unit.
But her health deteriorated with symptoms caused by a bowel obstruction which had not been diagnosed.
In a statement, the trust said: "The Worcestershire Acute Hospitals NHS Trust has accepted liability for shortcomings in the care and treatment shortly after birth and expresses its profound apologies to the individual and their family.
"The Honourable Mr Justice Stewart has approved a figure of damages to be awarded and the trust are pleased that this legal claim has now been resolved and that damages have been agreed to ensure that the future is provided for."
