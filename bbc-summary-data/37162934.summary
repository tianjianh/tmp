Car parks at beauty spots such as the Quiraing were closed on Monday, and are expected to be shut again for a time on Tuesday for a film crew.
Islanders have been told that the production is for Transformers: The Last Knight.
To be released in cinemas next June, it stars Laura Haddock, Sir Anthony Hopkins and Mark Wahlberg.
It has been suggested the fifth outing of the franchise about giant battling robots has a connection to the legend of King Arthur.
On Skye, actors have been seen wearing medieval garb and riding horses.
On Monday, car parks and also areas of land at the Quiraing and The Storr on the Trotternish Peninsula were closed to the public for filming.
Lealt Quarry is also thought to be being used by the film crew, and a helicopter has been seen flying over that location with a camera attached.
Scenes for other big budget features, including The BFG and Prometheus, have previously been shot on Skye.
