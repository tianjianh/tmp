£1.1bn M4 relief road public inquiry to begin

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An independent public inquiry into the £1.1bn M4 relief road to the south of Newport will start on Tuesday.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Welsh Government wants to build a six-lane motorway between Magor and Castleton to relieve congestion on the current M4 around the Brynglas tunnels.
The inquiry is due to last five months and will examine the controversial plan and alternatives to the 15-mile road.
Environmental groups, local residents and opposition politicians are among the many opponents to the plan.
The Welsh Government hopes construction of the new stretch of road, first proposed in 1991, will start in 2018 and open in 2021.
It insists the current M4 to the north of Newport was originally designed as a city bypass and "does not meet modern motorway design standards."
The latest traffic data from the Department of Transport shows up to 115,000 vehicles travel along Wales' busiest stretch of road, and the Welsh Government said it "carried a greater volume of traffic than it was originally designed for."
Officials also claim there is a higher than average accident rate on the M4 near Newport, and that congestion has a detrimental impact on the Welsh economy.
Up to 13 alternatives to the Welsh Government's chosen route will be discussed at the inquiry at Newport's Lysaght Institute.
There have been 335 formal objections, compared to 192 letters of support from bodies including the RSPB, Natural Resources Wales and the owners of Newport docks.
The proposed route cuts across the ancient marshlands of the Gwent Levels and sites of special scientific interest.
The Campaign Against the Levels Motorway group are planning a protest before the inquiry.
A joint open letter from 11 organisations, including the Campaign for the Protection of Rural Wales, Friends of the Earth Cymru and Sustrans Cymru, states that if the road goes ahead, "it will destroy ancient woodlands and miles of species-rich greens and ditches."
Wales' Future Generations Commissioner Sophie Howe has already said she believes the plan is "ill-conceived".
Inquiry inspector Bill Wadrup has previously insisted the independent inquiry would not simply push through the Welsh Government-backed route.
"You are certainly not wasting your time," he told people opposing the route. "If I thought this was a done deal I would be on the golf course."
The last major road inquiry in Wales was into the proposed crossing of the River Conwy in 1975.
Then the inspector recommended building a tunnel rather than the Welsh Office-backed bridge proposal, and a tunnel was subsequently opened in 1991.
