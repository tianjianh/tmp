The 20-year-old Wales Under-21 full-back made 45 starts on loan at Yeovil Town in League Two last season, but is yet to play a senior Swans game.
He is the 10th player to go out on loan from Swansea so far this campaign.
"He can play on the right, left, full-back or wing-back, and will provide competition for places," manager Darrell Clarke told Rovers' website.
