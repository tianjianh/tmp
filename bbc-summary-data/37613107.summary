Newcastle United midfielder Jack Colback says the camaraderie within the squad is the best it has been "by miles" during his time on Tyneside.

The Magpies currently sit third in the Championship table, having won seven of their 11 league games this season.
It follows an overhaul of the squad by manager Rafael Benitez, following relegation from the Premier League.
"Sometimes you get that group which have the right mentality," Colback, who joined Newcastle in June 2014, said.
"All the lads are good lads, we all get on and we fight for each other.
"It's the best it has been by a mile, I think it's what the club was missing."
Such a turnover of players - 12 new arrivals - has freshened up the squad for a Championship promotion push and followed the exits of international players such as Moussa Sissoko, Georginio Wijnaldum and Daryl Janmaat in the summer.
Matt Ritchie stepped down a league from Bournemouth for £12m, Dwight Gayle came in from Crystal Palace for a reported £10m, while Ciaran Clark and Issac Hayden are among the other signings to have impressed.
"The likes of Dwight and Matt have dropped down to play at this club, at this level. It's the size of the club, the potential which brings players like that here," Colback added to BBC Newcastle.
"Everyone wants to do well for each other, which is important."
