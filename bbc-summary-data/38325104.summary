YouTube blocks North Korean state television channel

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Google's video-streaming service YouTube has blocked North Korea's state television channel.

Korean Central Television's page now bears a message saying the account has "been terminated for violating YouTube's Community Guidelines".
The channel is used mainly for daily and breaking news broadcasts.
Reports suggest the reason could be the possibility of Pyongyang earning advertising money on the channel, which would violate US sanctions.
Sanctions imposed in March by the Treasury Department forbid American companies and people from doing business with Pyongyang's Propaganda and Agitation Department.
According to the Washington Post, the account was apparently blocked last month by Google to avoid violating the sanctions.
Google has declined to comment saying: "We don't comment on individual videos or channels."
"But we do disable accounts that violate our terms of service or community guidelines, and when we are required by law to do so."
In January, the channel was live with the news of another nuclear test in which the state had "successfully tested a hydrogen bomb", although that claim was disputed by experts.
