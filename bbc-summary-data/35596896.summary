Scottish middle-distance runner Laura Muir insists she has no concerns at this stage about the Zika virus ahead of this summer's Olympic Games in Rio.

The infection is suspected of leading to thousands of babies being born with underdeveloped brains in Brazil.
"I trust that the British Olympic Association will keep us best informed," said Muir, 22.
"I'm just going to keep on training and hopefully come the summer time, everything will be OK."
Veterinary medicine student Muir said she would continue to monitor the situation, with Zika having been declared a global public health emergency by the World Health Organisation.
"Because of my background with my studies, I know a little bit about it," she explained.
Last year, Muir finished fourth in the 3,000m in the European Indoor Championships in Prague and fifth in the 1500m at the World Championships in Beijing.
And she is confident she can build on that as she prepares for this summer's Games in Rio.
On Saturday, Muir will compete in the 800m at the Glasgow Indoor Grand Prix at the Emirates Arena.
Mo Farah, Kim Collins and Dina Asher-Smith are also due to appear in the last leg of the IAAF World Indoor Tour.
"It's the biggest indoor meet in the world," said Muir. "It's great to be racing here. Rio's a really big focus this year so we're doing a slightly smaller indoor season.
"This race is really important to see where I am over my speed and then it's back into training for Rio later on in the year."
