The leader of Dumfries and Galloway Council said the authority was committed to tackling poverty.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Ronnie Nicholson was speaking after it emerged that the local authority was just one of six to raise the school clothing grant for low income families.
Research by BBC Scotland showed that families in the area who met the criteria could obtain £80 per child.
This was £10 above the figure which was recommended by a Scottish government working group which reported in 2009.
Mr Nicholson said: "Anything we can do to help reduce the cost in school for these families having difficulties, we will try our best to do so."
