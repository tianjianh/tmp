Great grandfather Ron Walker was assaulted in April in Torquay, Devon, after being accused of running over a man's foot.
He died last Wednesday.
In an open letter to attacker Kevin Williams, Mr Walker's grandaughter Natalie Lynn had "lost his pride, dignity and trust in others".
Ms Lynn, 41, wrote: "Because of you my grandfather's last few months were lived in pain and fear".
"Because of you he became angry and confused.
"Because of you we were by his side, while he died afraid."
Mr Walker, served in Palestine and Suez, and as an MoD dog handler.
Williams, 43, of Torquay, was jailed by Exeter Crown Court for 20 months after he admitted causing actual bodily harm.
Ms Lynn said: "Ron Walker, or as I knew him Pop, was a humble man. He never liked to be the centre of attention and lived his life pretty anonymously, spreading cheer and happiness through Torquay with a smile or a sweet.
"He was a wonderful father, grandfather and great grandfather and will be greatly missed."
Devon and Cornwall Police said any decision on further charges would be made by the Crown Prosecution Service.
