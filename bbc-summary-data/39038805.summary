Offshore catering staff reject offer after phone ballot

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Offshore catering workers have rejected an offer of new terms and conditions from their trade body.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Unite and RMT unions said the latest proposals from the Catering Offshore Trade Association (Cota) would freeze pay at existing levels.
More than 60% of workers who took part in a ballot by phone turned the offer down. The unions will now consult with workers.
Cota expressed disappointment at the result of the consultative ballot.
Its chairman Andrew Thomson said: "We are committed to ongoing and open dialogue with employees and the unions."
