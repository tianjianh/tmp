[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Prosecutors are to launch a fresh review into the death of a toddler after a judge ruled she was sexually assaulted by her father before she died.

Poppi Worthington was 13 months old when she was found with serious injuries at her home in Barrow, Cumbria, in December 2012.
The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) previously said there was insufficient evidence to bring charges.
It now intends to review the case.
Key dates in the Poppi Worthington case.
A spokeswoman said: "On 19 September the CPS appeals and review unit received a request under the victims' right to review scheme in relation to the death of Poppi Worthington.
"The case material will be considered and the review will be completed as soon as possible."
Following Poppi's death a family judge ruled that, on the balance of probabilities, she had been sexually assaulted by her father Paul Worthington.
He was questioned on suspicion of sexual assault but never charged with any offence. He denies any wrongdoing.
In November 2015, the detective then in charge of the case admitted mistakes were made and an investigation by the Independent Police Complaints Commission is currently under way.
Cumbria's Safeguarding Children Board published a serious case review in June which concluded that the child's family had a "complex history", and if that had been noted more support could have been offered.
A second inquest was due to be held next month after the first, in October 2014, lasted just seven minutes and concluded Poppi's cause of death was "unascertained".
Cumbria coroner David Roberts has said the new inquest will be adjourned until the CPS has concluded its review, which was expected to take about two months.
