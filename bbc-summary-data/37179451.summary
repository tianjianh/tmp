Philip McGuigan: Sinn Féin announce Daithí McKay replacement

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Sinn Féin have announced that Causeway Coast and Glens Borough Councillor Philip McGuigan will replace Daithí McKay at Stormont.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Mr McGuigan has been selected for co-option to the North Antrim seat following Mr McKay's resignation.
Mr McKay resigned his seat following claims he "coached" loyalist blogger Jamie Bryson as a witness to an inquiry.
He said he accepted his actions were "inappropriate, ill-advised and wrong".
The 'coaching' allegations followed leaked messages between Mr Bryson, Mr McKay and Sinn Féin member Thomas O'Hara.
They exchanged messages before Mr Bryson testified to a Stormont inquiry, chaired by Mr McKay, into the National Asset Management Agency (Nama).
Mr McGuigan was first elected to the Ballymoney Council in 2001, aged 27. He then went on to win the Assembly seat for North Antrim in 2003 and served until 2007.
In 2007, Daithí McKay contested the North Antrim MLA seat and Mr McGuigan stood down as an MLA, remaining as a Sinn Féin councillor.
