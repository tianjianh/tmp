A 100-year-old Tall Ship from Denmark is to be restored in Northumberland in the hope of recreating an historic Antarctic adventure.

The charity, Blyth Tall Ship, is using Â£777,200 of Heritage Lottery funding to restore the wooden ketch, Haabet.
It is hoped after a two-year renovation, it will recreate the voyage of Blyth's William Smith, who found the first land in Antarctica.
The Haabet completed its journey to the Port of Blyth on Saturday.
The Haabet, which travelled from Svendborg in Denmark, is of a similar size and design to the merchant brig, Williams.
The Williams, built in Blyth in 1813 and skippered by local Captain William Smith, discovered the first land in Antarctica in 1819, according to the Heritage Lottery Fund.
It is hoped the renovated ship will be able to mark the 200th anniversary of the discovery by recreating the original voyage.
Clive Gray, chief executive of Blyth Tall Ship, said: "This is a major step towards recognising Blyth as the launch point of Antarctic discovery and putting Captain William Smith back in his rightful place in history."
The Haabet will also be used as the host ship when Blyth welcomes the Tall Ships regatta in 2016.
A team of 50 young people and volunteers will carry out the vessel's refit.
