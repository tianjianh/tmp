Wales at Euro 2016: Our journey is not over yet - John Hartson

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
It sounds ridiculous to say Wales are 90 minutes away from the final of Euro 2016, but we are - and anything can happen now.

I am trying not to get carried away, even though I think I really should, but I think we might even start Wednesday's semi-final against Portugal as favourites.
We go into that game with real optimism we can win this time too. We do not fear anybody right now, and our journey is not over yet.
Chris Coleman's team will get an amazing welcome when their tournament is over and they eventually return to Cardiff, but who knows when that might be?

This tournament has already given me so many great memories but Friday's win over Belgium was not just the proudest in Welsh football history, it was our greatest achievement in any sport.
I woke up on Saturday morning, had a long look in the mirror and said to myself 'did we really beat Belgium 3-1 last night?'
Then I pinched myself and I realised, yes, we actually did.

It feels like the whole country is together behind the team - I flew back to the UK later in the day and there were lots of Cardiff fans at the airport wanting photos with me, which does not happen often to a Swansea boy.
Our fans have been incredible for the entire tournament, and it was the same again in Lille. As the song goes, none of them want to go home.
I am the same, but I am off to Tenerife with my family on Tuesday. I will fly back to France on Wednesday for the game in Lyon, then go back on holiday on Thursday.
The same will happen on Sunday if we make it to the final - and that is definitely the plan at the moment.

I had about 300 text messages from people back home on Friday night, and I have still not had time to get back to them all.
If I had 300, Chris Coleman will have had at least twice as many, which is one of the reasons I have not been in touch with him.
Chris is not just an old international team-mate and colleague of mine - I was his assistant when he first took the Wales job - he is also a close friend.
I don't want to bother him at the moment, because he has enough on his plate, but he will know exactly how pleased I am about how well he is doing.
In a few weeks I will give him a quiet ring and ask him to give me a call next time he is in Swansea so we can go out for a bit of lunch and have a couple of beers, so we can celebrate in our own little time. There is a lot to talk about and plenty of time to do it.

It is a blow that Aaron Ramsey and Ben Davies are suspended and will miss the Portugal game but Chris has been tweaking his team throughout this tournament anyway.
As well as some very talented players, we have got brilliant team spirit, and have built incredible momentum and belief. We are missing two key players but we have got all of those things going our way.
We are also staying in games when the opposition is in the ascendancy and finding a bit of magic when it really matters.
One thing I have noticed at this tournament is that we are scoring big goals at big times, which is what teams like Germany, Italy and Spain usually do.
That is not just me talking with my Wales hat on, I genuinely think we are winning matches in France the way we are used to seeing the giants of the game succeed.
A lot of that is down to Chris. We thoroughly deserved to beat Belgium in the end, even though there was supposedly a massive difference in quality between some of their players and ours.

For example, Hal Robson-Kanu does not have a club, while Belgium striker Romelu Lukaku would go for up to Â£60m if he were to leave Everton this summer.
The players put in a mammoth effort but the standard of football we are playing needs discipline and organisation too. You can see why the team is brimming with confidence.
They were speaking about making a real impact at Euro 2016 since before the first ball of the tournament was kicked but, over the past few weeks, they have been proving it was not just talk.
John Hartson was talking to BBC Sport's Chris Bevan in Paris.
