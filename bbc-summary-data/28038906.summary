The pair had to wait until the early evening before getting under way, but Murray raced to a 6-2 6-3 6-2 win in one hour and 36 minutes.
Murray, 27, heads into round four on a 16-match winning streak at Wimbledon.
He will play 20th seed Kevin Anderson in the last 16 on Monday after the South African beat Fabio Fognini.
At 6ft 8in, Anderson will pose a very different challenge to the three opponents Murray has seen off, with plenty to spare, so far.
Bautista Agut, seeded 27th and ranked 23rd in the world, was expected to provide a sterner test, but Murray raised his level another notch as he dominated with 11 aces and 44 winners.
"There were a lot of close games and it's good to get it done in straight sets," Murray told BBC Sport.
"He's the best opponent I've played so far, and as a step up I felt I responded well. There's a few things I could improve on but it's a good first week.
"I had enough long matches in the French Open to get me physically ready."
Bautista Agut had spoken before the match of how he would not be "scared" of facing the champion on home ground but, after winning the first six points, his game was steadily picked apart.
Murray worked his way into the contest by winning a 27-stroke rally and broke to love after a stunning forehand cross-court pass on the run.
With his serve impressive once again, and Bautista Agut lacking the firepower to keep him at bay, Murray was able to dictate from the baseline and move his opponent around at will.
A second break helped the Scot take the first set in 26 minutes and he drew Bautista Agut into a forehand error to move ahead in the second, before whipping up a cross-court winner to break for the fourth time.
Approaching the hour mark, Murray had racked up 21 winners and won 24 of 25 points on his first serve.
It had been a masterclass, but the dominance finally wavered when he was broken for the first time all week when trying to serve out the second set.
Murray's sense of annoyance grew when he missed three set points from 0-40 in the following game, but he finally closed it out with a flashing return and a delicate backhand volley that coach Amelie Mauresmo would have been proud of.
Mauresmo and coaching assistant Dani Vallverdu could only applaud along with the rest of the Centre Court crowd when their man broke to love with a heavy backhand at the start of the third.
With victory all but assured at 4-0 there was another blip on the champion's serve, and Bautista Agut had a glimpse at getting right back into the set two games later, but he buried a backhand in the net at 30-30 and the chance was gone.
Murray finished off a highly impressive evening's work by dismantling the Bautista Agut serve once again, converting his fourth match point when the Spaniard fired long under pressure.
