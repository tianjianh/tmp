A court in Cairo has sentenced Egypt's former Prime Minister Ahmed Nazif to three years in prison for corruption.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Ahmed Nazif, who was prime minister from 2004 until last year's uprising, has also been ordered to pay a fine of 9m Egyptian pounds (Â£900,000; $1.5m).
Last year, Ahmed Nazif was given a one-year suspended sentence after he was charged for unlawful gains in a business deal.
Nazif is one of several Mubarak-era senior officials on trial.
He was arrested months after leaving his job in January 2011, shortly before President Hosni Mubarak stood down.
About a dozen former Egyptian officials have been charged either with conspiring to kill protesters or with various crimes related to corruption.
Mubarak was sentenced to life in prison in June for complicity in the killing of protesters.
