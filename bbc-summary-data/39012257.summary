[SN]TITLE[SN]
Dover Athletic 3-0 Eastleigh

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Ricky Miller's fourth hat-trick of the season earned Dover a comfortable victory over Eastleigh.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Miller side-footed the hosts into a third-minute lead after a good save from Ryan Clarke and from there Dover were always in control.
Eastleigh, under new caretaker boss Richard Hill, threatened sporadically, but Miller put the result beyond doubt with his second of the afternoon after 71 minutes.
The 27-year-old took his tally for the season to 32 goals eight minutes later to extend Dover's unbeaten run to four games, while Eastleigh have now gone eight league matches without a win.
