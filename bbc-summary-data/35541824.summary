Exeter's injured England duo Henry Slade and Dave Ewers are progressing well in their rehabilitation, according to head coach Rob Baxter.

Centre Slade, 22, broke his leg at Wasps on 5 December, while Ewers injured knee ligaments a week before.
Both were included in Eddie Jones' first England squad in January.
Flanker Ewers, 25, could be back in the Chiefs squad by the end of February and Slade has been running for the past few weeks and started kicking a ball.
"He's going to be a little way out from joining in with the lads in full training," Baxter said of Slade, who started England's final World Cup match against Uruguay last year.
"You're still talking weeks rather than days from where he is, but it's just fantastic to see that he can actually work on the rugby parts of his game now."
Ewers has yet to win a cap for England having been called up by Jones for the first time after an impressive couple of seasons at Sandy Park.
"We're in the end stage of his rehab," said Baxter.
"He did a little bit of contact work yesterday, he's been out doing a fair bit of running and changes of direction.
"We hope that all goes positively and we see him again in the next couple of weeks."
