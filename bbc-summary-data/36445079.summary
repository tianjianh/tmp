The 26-year-old former Watford trainee has been with the Gloucestershire outfit since January 2013.
He has made 104 league appearances for Rovers, who lost to Grimsby in the promotion final at Wembley on 15 May.
"For me, it was a no-brainer. We had a good season, I've been here a long time and have enjoyed my time," Bennett told the club website.
Goalkeeper Steven Arnold, who started Forest Green's promotion final defeat, has been released after two years with the club.
