Inmates taking part will work at the open prison's in-house cafe or at work placements with local coffee shops.
The project also aims to decrease reoffending rates and "encourage active citizenship".
It is being delivered by the Springboard Charity in partnership with Zest Training in St Andrews.
The prisoners have been trained in employability skills and completed fully accredited barista qualifications.
One participant, Ryan, said: "The whole experience has really helped me develop my confidence and skills.
"The skills learned during the training I have now carried over into the workplace"
Mary Stewart, HMP Castle Huntly's head of offender outcomes, said: "Springboard have been overwhelmed with those wishing to train, and from the original group now out in the community working, the feedback on their skills and work ethos has been nothing short of amazing."
