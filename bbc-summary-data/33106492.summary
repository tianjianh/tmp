[SN]TITLE[SN]
Abuse doctor Myles Bradbury has sentence reduced

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A paedophile doctor who abused young cancer patients in his care has had his 22-year sentence reduced to 16 years on appeal.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Myles Bradbury, 41, of Herringswell in Suffolk, admitted abusing 18 boys in his care at Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge, between 2009 and 2013.
He was jailed in December for sexual assault, voyeurism and possessing more than 16,000 indecent images.
His appeal was upheld at the Royal Courts of Justice earlier.
The paediatric consultant haematologist had taken images of his victims, some of whom had haemophilia, leukaemia and other serious illnesses, while treating them at Addenbrooke's Hospital.
Victims also told investigators he had focused on examining their genitals, when there was no medical need to do so.
At Bradbury's sentencing in Cambridge, Judge Gareth Hawkesworth told him: "In many years' experience on the bench, I have never come across a more culpable or grave course of sexual criminality, which has involved such a gross and grotesque breach and betrayal of your Hippocratic Oath and trust reposed in you by your patients, their families and colleagues."
He was jailed for 22 years for 25 offences involving boys aged between 10 and 16.
His intention to appeal against the length of his term was described as "shocking" by a victims' solicitor.
However, Angela Rafferty QC, representing Bradbury in the appeal court, argued that insufficient credit had been given for his guilty plea at an early stage.
She also told the court his actions were "low level... not high risk, penetrative".
Appeal judges Lady Justice Hallett, Mr Justice Haddon-Cave and Mr Justice Goss determined Bradbury's original 22-year sentence should be "restructured".
His custodial sentence will now be 16 years with an additional six years on licence.
Bradbury will have to serve at least 10 years and eight months before being considered for release.
Under his original 22-year sentence, Judge Hawkesworth told Bradbury: "You will be released after service of half of that sentence and then be released on licence."
Speaking after the appeal was upheld, Renu Daly of Hudgell Solicitors, which represents a number of the victims' families, said while they were disappointed the sentence had been cut, the situation was "much better".
She said the restructuring meant Bradbury would serve 10 years and eight months before even being considered for release, and would have to meet "far stricter" criteria if he is to be freed.
