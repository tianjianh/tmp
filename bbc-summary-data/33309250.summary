Carly Lovett, 24, a University of Lincoln graduate from Gainsborough, was with her fiance in Sousse when the gunman opened fire on the beach.
According to The Daily Mirror, the fashion blogger died when a grenade was thrown into her hotel lobby.
She had recently got engaged to Liam, her childhood sweetheart of 10 years.
In a statement her family said: "Carly was and always will be our beautiful shining light.
"She was funny, clever, artistic and radiated love and happiness around her."
They said Miss Lovett's and her fiance's future together had been "cruelly taken away".
"Both were excited and looking forward to a bright future together filled with love and happiness.
"To move forward through this we will try to do what we believe Carly would want and that is to love, cherish and support each other.
"Carly, may you soar with the angels and we pray with all our hearts that this evil, and such disregard for human life, will end so no other family will feel the pain that we do today and always will."
Peter Russell, deputy head of Queen Elizabeth High School, which Miss Lovett had attended, described her as kind and friendly.
"She was a high achiever and had a real flair for design," he said.
"[It has affected] the staff in particular, many here taught her and remember her fondly. They're obviously upset on hearing the tragic news."
Miss Lovett, a fashion blogger, also worked for an e-commerce company called Fizzco Ltd in Fillingham near Gainsborough, according to reports.
Local MP Sir Edward Leigh expressed his "shock and sorrow" and offered condolences to Miss Lovett's family.
Sir Edward said: "Words will never adequately provide comfort for those who must face a very different future to the one that they imagined."
