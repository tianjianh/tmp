[SN]TITLE[SN]
Dunfermline Athletic 5-1 Dumbarton

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Dumbarton's Stuart Carswell had to receive treatment after an exchange with team-mate Mark Docherty as Nicky Clark scored four for Dunfermline.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Paul McMullan scored the other as the Pars ended a run of five games without a win to move three points clear of the visitors in the Championship.
The Sons' reply by Daniel Hardie came with only four minutes to go.
Confusion reigned after Dunfermline's second goal as Carswell left the pitch to be treated for a bleeding nose.
Sam Stanton hastily came on as a replacement for the Sons, who had gone into the game unbeaten in their last four games.
Michael Moffat set up the opener for the Pars after only seven minutes with a teasing cross that found Clark unmarked to nod home.
Clark set up McMullan for number two and the winger curled a wonderful right-foot shot into the top corner.
Then came the bizarre incident between Carswell and Docherty.
Clark continued to cause problems for the Sons defence and duly scored goals three and four with headers inside the six-yard box.
The striker's fourth came when he was allowed to turn and fire a shot in from the edge of the penalty box.
Dumbarton's small band of supporters had something to cheer when Harvie fired in from 12 yards.
