Vodka and other spirits worth hundreds of pounds have been stolen from two Tesco stores in southern Scotland.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Two men made off with a trolley full of alcohol from the supermarket in Annan at about 13:40 on Thursday.
About 40 minutes later a man matching the description of one of the thieves in the earlier incident struck at the Lockerbie Road store in Dumfries.
PC Carolyne Crozier said there were "clear similarities" between the thefts and asked witnesses to come forward.
Spirits worth more than Â£500 were taken in the first incident.
One of the men involved was in his late 40s, of medium build with dark hair with grey starting to show.
He was about 5ft 8in tall and was wearing a navy polo shirt with stripes across the front and jeans.
The second man was in his late 20s or early 30s, of slim build, quite tall with short, dark hair and was wearing Adidas three-stripe tracksuit bottoms and a hooded top.
In the Dumfries incident, a man was seen putting alcohol straight into a carrier bag. When stock was checked, it was found 10 bottles of vodka worth more than Â£400 had been taken.
The suspect was described as being tall and wearing Adidas striped tracksuit bottoms and an Adidas hooded top.
In a separate incident on the same day cashmere jumpers worth more than Â£600 were taken from The Canny Scots Shop at the Gretna Service Area between 10:00 and 12:30.
PC Crozier said: "There are clear similarities between the two Tesco thefts, right down to the description of one of the suspects.
"We are keeping an open mind as to whether or not the cashmere theft is linked."
