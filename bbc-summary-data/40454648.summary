Bublik earned his place at Wimbledon as a lucky loser - a player who lost in the final round of qualifying but comes into the draw as someone else has pulled out through injury.
It will be the first time Murray has played the 20-year-old, who said he had the "biggest luck of life" in drawing the defending champion.
Konta, who withdrew from her semi-final at Eastbourne with a back injury on Friday, will begin her Wimbledon campaign against Hsieh.
The 26-year-old was surprisingly beaten by the Taiwanese player in the French Open first round.
Defending women's champion Serena Williams is absent as she awaits the birth of her first child.
The men's draw put Murray and fourth seed Rafael Nadal of Spain in the same half as potential semi-final opponents, with Swiss third seed Federer and second seed Novak Djokovic of Serbia together in the opposite half.
World number one Murray will head into Wimbledon without a win on grass this year.
Murray lost to world number 90 Jordan Thompson of Australia in the first round at Queen's Club, and then pulled out of two exhibition matches with a hip injury.
If he makes it through his first match, Murray will face German Dustin Brown or Portugal's Joao Sousa in round two, with Australian Nick Kyrgios potentially waiting in round four and Stan Wawrinka of Switzerland in the quarter-finals.
Federer is seen by many as the favourite for the men's title after a stunning start to 2017 that included an 18th major title at the Australian Open, followed by back-to-back wins at Indian Wells and Miami.
The 35-year-old warmed up for Wimbledon with a record ninth victory in the grass-court event at Halle, Germany.
Three-time champion Djokovic, who has struggled for form since losing in the third round last year, will play Slovakia's Martin Klizan in round one and could meet former US Open champion Juan Martin del Potro as early as round three.
Nadal is hopeful of a strong showing after several lean years at Wimbledon as he struggled with injuries.
The two-time winner, fresh from a record 10th French Open title, will play Australian John Millman in round one.
In the women's draw, top seed and last year's runner-up Angelique Kerber of Germany opens against a qualifier or lucky loser, as does Romanian second seed Simona Halep.
Czech two-time champion Petra Kvitova, who returned last month following a knife attack, plays Sweden's Johanna Larsson.
Belarusian Victoria Azarenka returns to a Grand Slam for the first time since giving birth to her son Leo, and plays American teenager Cici Bellis, while five-time champion Venus Williams of the US takes on Belgian Elise Mertens.
There are 12 British players in the singles draws - seven of them wildcards, four there through their rankings, and Alex Ward - the world number 855 - having come through qualifying.
The 27-year-old from Northampton, who slipped down the rankings last year after six months out with a wrist injury, will play British number two Kyle Edmund.
British number four Aljaz Bedene plays Croatia's Ivo Karlovic.
Among the wildcards, Cameron Norrie will face France's Jo-Wilfried Tsonga, James Ward plays Marcos Baghdatis of Cyprus, Brydan Klein plays Yuchi Sugita of Japan.
Katie Boulter takes on American Christina McHale, Naomi Broady will face Romania's Irina-Camelia Begu, Laura Robson plays Brazil's Beatriz Haddad Maia, and Heather Watson is up against Ukraine's Maryna Zanevska.
BBC Sport tennis correspondent Russell Fuller:
Andy Murray is in the same half of the draw as Rafael Nadal and could play Stan Wawrinka in the quarter-finals, but that seems a long way away given the soreness he has been feeling in his hip.
Dustin Brown and Nick Kyrgios - two players to have beaten Nadal here in recent years - are potential second and fourth round opponents.
All five British women have avoided top 50 players in the opening round.
If Johanna Konta can beat Hsieh Su-wei she could face Donna Vekic, who beat her in the Nottingham final, in the second round and possibly Petra Kvitova in the last 16.
