Lineham, 24, was sin-binned for lashing out at Leigh's Ryan Hampshire in the second half of Thursday's 22-8 defeat.
Centurions forward Glenn Stewart has been banned for two games for a high tackle on Wolves half-back Kevin Brown in the same Super League match.
Wakefield second-rower Danny Kirmond was fined £300 after admitting a high tackle in Friday's loss at Leeds.
Warrington, who were beaten in last season's Grand Final by Wigan, have lost all five Super League matches in 2017 and are bottom of the table.
Lineham pleaded guilty to the reckless strike charge at a Rugby Football League hearing on Tuesday, but challenged the grading of his offence.
However, officials upheld it as a Grade C charge.
