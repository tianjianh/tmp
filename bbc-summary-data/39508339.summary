A gang blew up cash machines at banks and supermarkets across England and Scotland stealing hundreds of thousands of pounds, a court has heard.

Some machines were blown up using "powerful explosives", while others were dragged outside and attacked with high-powered saws to access the cash.
The seven men were convicted of conspiracy to cause an explosion and burglary at Liverpool Crown Court.
They are due to be sentenced on 19 April.
The gang, mostly from Merseyside, was caught after a covert police operation.
The court was told they carried out 13 raids between February 2015 and February 2016.
The attacks happened in Sonnings Common and Woodstock, Oxfordshire; Alsager and Culcheth, Cheshire;  Huyton, Merseyside; Hucclecote, Gloucestershire; Swindon, Wiltshire; Bury-St-Edmunds, Suffolk; as well as in Aberdeen, Carnoustie, and Perth.
An investigation by TITAN, the Northwest Regional Organised Crime Unit, found the gang stole high-powered vehicles to carry out the raids which they concealed in a special trailer attached to a lorry.
The men slept in hammocks inside the trailer which also had fuel containers to reduce the number of times they had to use petrol stations or motorway services, Merseyside Police said.
Det Ch Supt Chris Green, head of TITAN, said: "These individuals believed they were untouchable and they used dangerous tactics in targeting ATM's, which clearly put members of the public at risk."
Maria Corr, of the Crown Prosecution Service, added: "These men were ruthless, organised criminals who conspired to cause explosions and burgle banks up and down the country.
"They thought nothing of using powerful explosives to blow up cash machines in residential areas, putting nearby residents in real danger."
