Borrowash murder and M1 death: 'Pressure to the neck' caused death

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A woman whose murder was connected with her husband's death and a violent attack on her son died from "pressure on her neck" an inquest heard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Claire Nagle, 38, was found unconscious at her mother's Derbyshire home after her son Nathan Paton, 22, was discovered nearby covered in blood.
Mrs Nagle's estranged husband Vincent, 44, died when he was hit by a lorry on the M1 about half an hour later.
Inquests into the deaths were adjourned at South Derbyshire Coroners' Court.
Hundreds of drivers were left stranded on the motorway near Trowell services in Nottinghamshire after Mr Nagle was hit by a lorry.
Earlier in the day, Mr Paton was found covered in blood wandering in the village of Borrowash.
He told eyewitnesses he had been attacked with a nail gun and alerted police to his mum who was found unconscious in a nearby house.
Mr Paton remains in hospital.
Officers said they were not looking for anyone else in connection with the investigation into all three incidents.
Inquests into both deaths were opened and adjourned separately earlier.
The hearing into Mrs Nagle's death was told the trainee mental health nurse was found with bruising and ligature marks around her neck along with signs of asphyxia.
A provisional cause of death was given as pressure on her neck.
The second hearing was told that Mr Nagle, a plumber and heating engineer, died instantly when he was hit by the lorry.
They were living apart at the time of their deaths, the court was told.
Both hearings were adjourned by senior coroner Dr Robert Hunter while police continue their investigations.
