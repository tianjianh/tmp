Rhondda Cynon Taff parents lose nursery legal battle

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Parents campaigning against plans to cut nursery provision in Rhondda Cynon Taff have lost their case at the High Court.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The local authority faced a Â£70.7m hole in its budget for 2015-18 and had to cut its cloth accordingly, Mrs Justice Patterson ruled on Monday.
In February, the council announced free nursery places for three-year-olds would be withdrawn from this September.
The court decision comes a year after parents won an initial legal battle.
Under the new system, children aged three will now be offered free part-time nursery care but will not get full-time education until they are four.
The High Court in London heard that the decision would affect more than 3,300 children and their families.
But Mrs Justice Patterson said the council had "dealt adequately with the issue of realistic alternatives".
The decision was a defeat for mothers Angharad Morris and Donna Thomas who mounted the judicial review challenge.
