Operators of an exhibition dedicated to a south of Scotland wartime munitions factory say the move to a purpose-built museum has proved a success.

It has culminated with the Devil's Porridge in Eastriggs becoming a four-star VisitScotland attraction.
It is run by a team of volunteers and tells the story of the factory, which stretched from Dornock to Longtown.
The exhibition is named after the explosive cordite paste that was manufactured on the site.
More than 18,000 people visited the museum in its first year of operation.
Founder Richard Brodie said the next target was to secure five-star status, but the first 12 months has surpassed all expectation.
"It is quite a feat for our volunteer group to achieve such a high grade but we have ambitions to achieve top marks," he said.
"Indeed our first VisitScotland assessment gave us five stars but the follow-up inspection requires us to make some improvements to attain that prestigious accolade."
