[SN]TITLE[SN]
Ex-Devon teacher Chay Roberts-Jones guilty of groping teen

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A public school teacher has been found guilty of groping an 18-year-old girl under the guise of giving her a sports massage.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Chay Roberts-Jones, of Preston Street, Exeter, was accused of three counts of sexual assault, which he denied at Exeter Crown Court.
The 29-year-old was cleared of sexually assaulting two other girls and will be sentenced in March.
He was suspended from Blundells School, in Devon, over the allegations.
A police inquiry was launched after an 18-year-old girl reported he had run his hands over her thighs, lifted her top and tried to pull down her jeans.
The girl said Roberts-Jones had kissed her neck and tried to kiss her on the lips.
Two other girls, aged 16 and 18, came forward and alleged he groped them, but the jury cleared him of these offences.
He had been a teacher at Blundells for five years and taught physics as well as coaching a number of sports.
Roberts-Jones married his fiancÃ©e shortly after he was suspended and now lives in France where he teaches adults.
Recorder Mr Philip Mott ordered him to sign on the sex offenders' register and surrender his passport pending sentencing in March.
