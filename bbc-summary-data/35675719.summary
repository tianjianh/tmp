It took until after the half-hour mark for the first shot on target when Daggers winger Ashley Hemmings forced Scott Flinders to make a good save.
York captain Russell Penn was sent off for handling the ball on the line but Joss Labadie saw his penalty saved.
With 12 minutes remaining Passley turned in Hemmings' cross from the left but both sides remain in the drop zone.
In the meeting of the Football League's bottom two clubs, Dagenham move to within two points of 23rd-placed York City, but remain seven points adrift of safety.
Dagenham & Redbridge manager John Still told BBC Radio London:

"It's an important win and a really good performance. I was really, really pleased.
"We missed too many chances and that's something we have to be aware of. But, at the end of the day, it's a win.
"We've got a lot of tough games to go, but it's a win that now hopefully gives us a little bit of belief."
York City manager Jackie McNamara told BBC Radio York:

"It wasn't a great performance or a pretty game at all. I anticipated a battle. I think that's what it was. Certain areas they outfought us.
"There was too many of us not on our game today, not up for a real battle and roll our sleeves up.
"In the end that was the telling point and a disappointing end for me."
