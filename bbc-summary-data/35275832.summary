They were called to the premises in the Sirhowy Valley village at about 19:30 GMT on Saturday.
Fire crews were back at the scene on Sunday checking for any hotspots after extinguishing the flames.
A joint investigation with police is now under way to establish how the fire was started, and who was responsible.
