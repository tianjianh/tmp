He has written to Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board raising concerns over the move.
Under the changes women needing a consultant will have to go to Ysbyty Gwynedd or Wrexham Maelor hospitals.
Mr Drakeford has asked for "assurances" on behalf of expectant mothers.
He wants a "definitive timescale" on when the service will be returned to the hospital.
In the letter, addressed to the health board, Mr Drakeford said: "It's very important that patients and their families are provided with clear in formation on this very important matter, without any room for ambiguity."
The health board welcomed the letter.
