The festival will also include a world premiere of the score from Oscar-winning film There Will Be Blood by Radiohead's Jonny Greenwood.
Greenwood will play alongside the London Contemporary Orchestra.
Sinead O'Connor will also perform for the Roundhouse Summer Sessions, running from 24 July to 24 August.
Another highlight will be an excerpt from the new Balletboyz production, Young Men, which will premiere at Sadler's Wells in January 2015.
They will also present their award-winning show Serpent/Fallen for the final time in London.
Greenwood's film score will be performed on 6 and 7 August. Greenwood's work as a film composer includes We Need to Talk About Kevin and The Master.
Heap will perform Sparks at the end of the Reverb Festival, the already established Roundhouse event that this year becomes part of the new Summer Sessions.  She is also Reverb's 2014 curator.
It will include live performances from artists such as Tim Exile and Leafcutter John.
Other events taking place during Summer Sessions include circus extravaganza, Boom + Bang Cabaret, the Roundhouse's annual poetry slam final and a performance from the Penguin Cafe orchestra.
