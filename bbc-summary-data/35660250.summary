[SN]TITLE[SN]
Selkirk woman admonished over Falkirk toddler-dragging incident

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A Selkirk woman who admitted shouting and swearing at a two-year-old girl and dragging her along the ground by her reins has been admonished in court.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Jodie Mitchell, 26, pleaded guilty to behaving in a threatening manner towards the girl at Falkirk's Central Retail Park in February last year.
She was traced after police circulated CCTV images of the episode.
Sentence had been deferred for her to be of good behaviour and to prove it had been a one-off incident.
Mitchell had previously told Falkirk Sheriff Court she was under stress at the time.
Sheriff Linda Smith was told she had not come to the attention of the police since the incident, and ordered her to be simply admonished.
