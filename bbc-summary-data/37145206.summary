The Syria Solidarity Campaign said 10-year-old Ali "passed away today due to his injuries from the bombing of his house by Russia/Assad".
Russian and Syrian jets have carried out heavy raids on rebel-held areas.
Omran, five, was filmed caked in dust and blood after his home was hit.
The pictures - symbolising the suffering of Aleppo's trapped civilians - caused worldwide outrage.
An unidentified witness in Aleppo quoted by Reuters news agency said Ali Daqneesh had suffered internal bleeding and organ damage after the 17 August bombing.
And a tweet from Kareem Shaheen, a Middle East reporter, said: "Have confirmed with Omar Daqneesh's doctor, his older brother died from wounds sustained during strike that wounded Omran".
Aleppo, once Syria's commercial and industrial centre, has been divided roughly in two since 2012, with the government controlling the west and rebels the east.
