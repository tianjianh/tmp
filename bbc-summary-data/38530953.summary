Centuries-old Haxey Hood game held

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A traditional mass rugby-style event dating back to the 14th Century has been held.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Haxey Hood is contested by patrons of pubs in the neighbouring villages of Haxey and Westwoodside in North Lincolnshire, and can run for hours.
The Hood, a leather tube about one metre in length, is pushed in a scrum until it reaches one of four pubs.
The contest is held annually on the Twelfth Day of Christmas.
There is also a procession around participating public houses, The Carpenters Arms in Westwoodside, and the Kings Arms, The Loco and the Duke William, all in Haxey.
The King's Arms were crowned this year's winners.
The tradition is said to have started when Lady de Mowbray was out riding between Westwoodside and Haxey - between Gainsborough, Scunthorpe and Doncaster - when her silk riding hood was blown away by the wind.
She is said to have been so amused to see local farm workers chasing it she rewarded them land - on condition the chase be re-enacted every year.
The story says the worker who caught the hood was too shy to approach her and handed it to a fellow worker to return.
It is said Lady de Mowbray thanked the man who returned the hood and said he had acted like a lord. The worker who caught it was labelled a fool.
The main event starts when the hood is thrown into the middle of the scrum, or sway, as it is known locally.
The sway pushes through the villages, with each team trying to direct it towards their pub.
The contest ends when the Hood is touched by the landlord of the winning team's pub.
