Chris Young, a producer of E4's award-winning comedy The Inbetweeners and Gaelic series Bannan, plans to make a crime drama in the city.
Here Comes the Night is still in development, but Young hopes filming could potentially start next summer.
He said: "There are a number of things that are appealing about Inverness as a setting."
Describing it as a "light to dark tale", Young said the drama would chronicle the slow unravelling of one man's faith in his work, his city and his religion as he seeks the truth behind his daughter's death.
He said Inverness and surrounding area had the locations to help tell the story.
Young said: "In recent times it has seen an urban sprawl of new developments that stand alongside a very gothic and historic city centre.
"The mix of old and modern, urban, suburban and rural offers a great setting for a contemporary Scottish drama.
"The city offers an exciting opportunity to make a really interesting commentary on modern Scottish life.
"It offers a break away from the stereotypes that other Scottish cities have been bogged down in when portrayed in TV and film."
The producer's Skye-based company Young Films makes Bannan for BBC Alba.
Young said: "Bannan was the first Gaelic TV drama to be commissioned in nearly 20 years.
"It is a great responsibility and we were eager to demonstrate that Young Films were able to deliver high quality, authentic Gaelic drama, as well as set a strong foundation and workable model for a long running drama.
"If we can deliver nine hours of TV drama in Gaelic in Skye in two years, it shows the potential of what can be achieved with indigenous film and TV production in Scotland."
He said Here Comes the Night was still in its "infancy".
Young added: "We are currently progressing the project to full script development and we would hope to have it commissioned and fully funded ready to start shooting sometime next summer."
BBC show Hope Springs starring Alex Kingston and broadcast in 2009 used Inverness as a setting.
Also in 2009, Indian art house thriller Three: Love, Lies, Betrayal was shot in Inverness and around Loch Ness.
