Jedburgh schools campus proposals scrutinised

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Plans to merge two primaries and a secondary in a Borders town are set to receive further scrutiny.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The proposals to overhaul education provision in Jedburgh emerged earlier this year.
They would see Parkside and Howdenburn primaries and Jedburgh Grammar shut and replaced by a new campus for children aged two to 18 at Hartrigge Park.
The latest consultation event is being held in the Grammar School's assembly hall from noon until 19:00.
Scottish Borders Council has said the campus would have state-of-the-art classrooms and learning spaces, the very best IT infrastructure and first-class leisure and dining provision, as well as the very best sporting and PE facilities.
The project could be approved later this year with the new Jedburgh campus operational by 2020.
