The 23-year-old came through the youth system at Birmingham City but moved into non-league after he failed to play for the first team.
He spent two seasons at Cheltenham Town before joining Solihull in the summer.
Sterling-James' new deal comes just two days after scoring twice in the 3-2 Boxing Day win over Chester.
"I've really enjoyed working with Liam McDonald again," said Sterling-James, who first played for the Moors boss in their days together at Redditch. "I feel that this football club is going places."
