The 31-year-old, who has played 37 Tests for the Proteas, will be at Hove until mid-June.
The right-arm seamer will be available for six County Championship matches and the group stage of the One-Day Cup.
"It is very exciting to have a player of that ilk joining us," head coach Mark Davis told BBC Sussex.
"He is a world-class bowler and is a fantastic batter.
"He was injured a while ago but has come back really strong in the Australia series which South Africa just played. He will bring a lot of experience."
Philander has previously had spells in county cricket with Middlesex, Somerset, Kent and Nottinghamshire.
He has also played 30 one-day internationals and seven Twenty20 internationals for South Africa.
Meanwhile, former Sussex and England wicketkeeper-batsman Matt Prior will return to Hove in January to help Ben Brown work on his wicketkeeping.
