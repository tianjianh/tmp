Labour's Keith Reynolds said "health issues" forced him to make the decision before council elections on 4 May.
He said he was "extremely proud and honoured" to have represented Aberbargoed for 38 years and to have served as leader for three years.
Chris Burns, the council's interim chief executive, described him as "an outstanding public servant".
