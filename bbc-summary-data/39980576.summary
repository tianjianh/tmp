Holyfield, 54, had mistakenly messaged the Super League champions last week while trying to include NBA basketball team Golden State Warriors.
England international Farrell, 26, has signed a five-year deal.
Tautai, 29, signed a three-year deal while Tomkins, 30, signed for two.
All three players were part of the Wigan side which won the Super League title last season and then beat Cronulla Sharks in February's World Club Challenge.
"It is important, not only on the field but off it as well, that we secure the future of our key players and Liam, Joel and Taulima are three of those," Wigan chairman Ian Lenagan said.
