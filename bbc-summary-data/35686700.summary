Australia international half-back Terry Campese says the sacking of Hull KR head coach Chris Chester shows rugby league is a "cut-throat business".

Chester was dismissed as Rovers coach after just three games of the 2016 Super League season after two defeats and a draw by his side.
Assistant Willie Poching took charge for Friday's home defeat by St Helens.
"It's the sport we play, it's the reality," Campese told the BBC's Super League Show.
"It's a cut-throat business - players go out on loan, players get injured, you can get a change of staff."
Former Halifax, Wigan, Robins and Hull FC back-rower Chester took over at Craven Park following the departure of Craig Sandercock in 2014.
He guided the club to the Challenge Cup final in 2015, his one full season in charge, but they were beaten by Leeds Rhinos at Wembley.
Despite a third defeat in four games against Keiron Cunningham's Saints, Rovers showed signs of revival with four tries under caretaker boss Poching.
The New Zealander, 42, was previously on the staff at Warrington under Tony Smith, and also Samoa at international level.
"It's always tough when a head coach leaves, there's a big disruption but the boys handled it well," Campese added.
"In the first half you wouldn't have thought we'd had the week we did, we went out there and played some enjoyable footy.
"[Willie's] been assistant coach for the past year or so and our defensive coach, I thought he relished last week,"
"It's something he's been waiting for. the boys turned up for him and hopefully they can do this weekend too."
