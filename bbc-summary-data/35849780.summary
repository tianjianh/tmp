[SN]TITLE[SN]
East Fife 1-1 Queen's Park

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
East Fife moved two points clear at the top of Scottish League Two, despite only drawing with Queen's Park.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
With nearest challengers Clyde and third-placed Elgin City both losing, the Fifers were able to extend their lead.
Jamie Insall's early strike gave the hosts an advantage against the Spiders.
However, a shot by Chris Duggan levelled matters for the visitors and neither side could find a winner in the second period.
