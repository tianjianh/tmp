Brown was charged by the FA after the Shrimpers' 3-2 loss at Bury on 8 May - the final day of the League One season.
Brown, also fined Â£3,000, admitted four breaches, while a fifth was found proven by an Independent Regulatory Commission hearing on Wednesday.
"I have learned my lesson and I will take this into account regarding my future conduct," the 57-year-old said.
"They have come to the right decision. I was wrong in my actions and I apologise to everyone associated with the club and the officials from the Bury game," the former Hull boss added.
The misconduct charges stated that from the third minute of injury time through until half-an-hour after the match had finished, Brown's language and/or behaviour was abusive and/or insulting and/or improper on five separate occasions.
He also said after the match that assistant referee Barry Gordon should be "struck off" for his role in awarding the late spot-kick which led to Bury's 94th-minute winner.
