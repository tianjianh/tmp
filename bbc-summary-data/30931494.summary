"Hope made a poor decision that has resulted in a negative impact on US Soccer and her team-mates," head coach Jill Ellis said.
Solo, 33, will now miss matches on 8 February against France and 13 February against England.
This month, domestic violence charges against Solo were dropped.
In 2012, Solo, tested positive for a banned substance a month before winning a second Olympic gold medal.
She maintained she was not aware the pre-menstrual medication she had been prescribed contained a banned substance and she was cleared of any wrongdoing.
The US are preparing for the Women's World Cup in Canada in June when they will aim to win their third title following victories in 1991 and 1999.
The latest incident surrounding Solo concerns a training camp being held by the team in Carson, California.
Solo's husband, former Seattle Seahawks NFL player Jerramy Stevens, was arrested on suspicion of driving under the influence in Los Angeles in the early hours of Monday morning.
Media reports claimed Solo was in the car but she was not cited in the incident by Manhattan Beach police officials.
Solo tweeted: "I think it's best for me to take a break, decompress from the stress of the last several months and come back mentally and physically ready to positively contribute to the team."
