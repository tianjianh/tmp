Armed police were called to Highcliffe School in Christchurch shortly after midday.
The school was placed in emergency lockdown, but has since reopened.
A 26-year-old man from Christchurch was initially held on suspicion of firearm offences but was de-arrested at the scene. A number of air pellets were found.
Police said there was no risk to pupils or staff. No-one was injured.
A Dorset Police spokeswoman said: "Police officers have now left the scene and police community support officers remain in the area carrying out community reassurance patrols.
"The school is back to normal and police have completed a full and thorough search of the area.
"We have moved this matter from a response to an investigative phase.... inquires are continuing."
