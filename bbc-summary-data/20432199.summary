[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Avon and Somerset's first police and crime commissioner (PCC) has been sworn in.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Sue Mountstevens has taken over from the police authority and will be responsible for setting the police budget and priorities.
The ceremony took place at The Station youth centre in Bristol city centre.
Ms Mountstevens, who ran as an independent, swore an oath of impartiality, written by the Home Office for such ceremonies.
During the ceremony, she said: "My two biggest stakeholders at the forefront of my mind are the residents but also the constabulary, I have seen at firsthand they are hard-working, they are committed and they are brave people.
"My job is to work with them to develop a common vision of great policing and then help iron out the obstacles in delivering that, so we can cut crime and make our communities safer."
Ms Mountstevens also confirmed 24 new officers would join the force next January, with a further 48 set to join later in the year.
Prior to the event, she also confirmed there would be no increase in the police's share of the council tax bill next year.
Her police priorities will be dealing with anti-social behaviour and reducing violent crime against women and children.
She will also allocate "at least Â£200,000" in an enabling fund, to groups and charities whose work reflect her priorities.
The ceremony was attended by former members of the police authority and members of the voluntary sector which used to benefit from police community safety funding.
