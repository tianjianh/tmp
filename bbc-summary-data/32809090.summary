Ten drawings by Leonardo da Vinci from the Queen's Royal Collection are to tour the UK and Ireland next year.

The works will include the master's chalk portrait of St Anne, sketches of bodies, animals, water and plants, plus some technical drawings.
The exhibition will begin at Newcastle's Laing gallery in February.
It will then visit the National Gallery of Ireland in Dublin, Nottingham Castle Museum and Art Gallery and Glynn Vivian Art Gallery in Swansea.
Da Vinci made only around 20 paintings during his lifetime, including the Mona Lisa and The Last Supper, but left many more drawings.
Royal Collection Trust director Jonathan Marsden said the selected works were "among the greatest artistic treasures of this country".
He said: "Through this touring exhibition, we aim to bring these extraordinary works of art within easy reach of people across Great Britain and Ireland."
Julie Milne, chief curator at Tyne & Wear Archives & Museums, said: "We are honoured to be chosen as the first venue to host this exhibition of ten Leonardo da Vinci drawings on its tour of the UK and Ireland.
"This will be a rare opportunity for people in the North East of England to see the exquisite work of one of the greatest artists of all time."
