Wokingham parade marks REME regiment's Arborfield departure

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Troops from the Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers (REME) have marched through Wokingham to mark the regiment's departure from its Berkshire base.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
REME is moving from Arborfield Garrison to Lyneham, Wiltshire.
A new Â£121m Defence College of Technical Training is currently being built at the former RAF base, which closed in 2012.
The move is part of changes across all three services of the armed forces.
Wokingham has had a military presence for more than a century -  the Army first established a horse depot at Arborfield in 1904.
The parade saw the 300-strong contingent march down Peach Street.
Led by its brass band, it was then met by an inspection party on Broad Street, which included the town mayor Philip Mirfin.
The new college at Lyneham is the first stage of a Â£230m transformation of the airbase.
REME training will cease at Arborfield and also Bordon Garrison, in Hampshire, in September, and is due to begin at Lyneham by November.
Wokingham Borough Council plans to construct a secondary school at the Arborfield Garrison site, as the first phase of a "village-style suburb".
