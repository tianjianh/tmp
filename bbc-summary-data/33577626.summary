The Open Golf Championship in St Andrews was suspended after just 32 minutes of play, with 40mph gusts of wind blowing balls across greens.
A welfare van opened early in Alyth to help residents affected by flash flooding which cut power off and forced people from their homes.
Storms also saw the evacuation of the Tiree Music Festival site overnight.
The Scottish Environment Protection Agency (Sepa) now has just one flood warning for the Innerpeffray to Bridge of Earn area, with most of its flood alerts also stood down.
Scottish Hydro Electric Power Distribution was dealing with more than 750 homes in Alyth cut off at the peak of the problems.
Only a handful still have no electricity and Scottish Hydro said it was working to reconnect them "where it was safe to do so".
A company spokesman said a bridge over the Alyth Burn that carried cables was washed away.
At the golf, the lost competition time means The Open will be played through until Monday, instead of Sunday.
The Met Office has now lifted its severe weather warning, which had run through until 13:00 on Saturday.
The forecast for the rest of day is improving, becoming drier and brighter for most.
Rain should also gradually die away from part of North Argyll and the West Highlands.
