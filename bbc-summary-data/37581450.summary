It showed the Russian leader in front of his country's flag when it was unfurled on the New York landmark which connects Manhattan to Brooklyn.
Photos of the mysterious banner quickly began trending on social media.
Police officers removed it a short time later, and are investigating. There have been no arrests.
Tensions between the Washington and Moscow have remained high in recent months.
Russia has been accused of meddling in the US presidential election, after the Democratic Party suffered a wave of cyber attacks.
