[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The deputy chairwoman of an NHS governing body has resigned after a committee she chaired was criticised for making decisions on pay increases.

Liverpool Clinical Commissioning Group (CCG) is under review by NHS England following pay rises of up to 50%.
Prof Maureen Williams, who has stood down, saw an increase of at least a third, from £70,000-£75,000 to £100,000 in the 2014-15 financial year.
An initial report also highlighted "weakness in governance".
The government ordered the review into the CCG in March after Rosie Cooper, the MP for West Lancashire, raised concerns about pay increases for governing body members between 2013-14 and 2014-15.
Most of the pay rises relate to the 2014-15 financial year, when chairman Dr Nadim Fazlani's salary rose from approximately £105,000 to £155,000.
The chief officer and chief finance officer both received rises of about 15%.
The review said the remuneration committee, of which Prof Williams was chair, had "acted outside its terms of reference" by making decisions on pay increases, rather than making recommendations.
It highlighted conflicts of interest, particularly in the CCG's first year of operation in 2013-14, which "were not managed robustly with a lack of independent advice and scrutiny of decisions".
Dr Fazlani said the CCG "fully accept these findings and will be taking immediate action to strengthen governance in relation to the remuneration of governing body members".
