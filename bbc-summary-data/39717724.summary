Police said the 32-year-old was punched in the face and knocked to the ground before being sexually assaulted  at about 21:00 on Tuesday in West Lothian.
The attack took place on a popular path in woodland next to the A89, east of the Armadale Speedway racetrack.
The suspect is white, aged between 30 and 40, about 6ft, with dark hair and has a Scottish accent.
He was wearing dark clothing.
The woman is still being treated in hospital for multiple injuries.
Detectives have suggested it could have been a premeditated attack.
Police Scotland said the investigation was a top priority with 50 officers on the case.
Forensic experts are examining the scene, officers are trawling CCTV footage and making door-to-door inquiries.
The police said they are "extremely eager" to speak to anyone who heard or saw anything suspicious on the popular walking and running route.
Officers said they have had a good response locally. There are also officers patrolling the area on bicycles.
Det Supt Pat Campbell said the victim had gone through an "absolutely terrifying ordeal".
"We are extremely eager to hear from anyone who remembers seeing any suspicious activity on the footpath or around the racetrack," he said.
"The area is popular with dog walkers and joggers and so we are hopeful that someone may have vital information relevant to our inquiry.
"If you believe you saw something, or can help provide us with a better description of the suspect then please contact police immediately."
The man ran off after the attack and the woman was taken to hospital with injuries to her face, back and shoulder.
Ch Insp Barry Blair added: "Horrific crimes such as this remain rare within West Lothian, but nevertheless, we recognise the significant impact they can have on the community and local officers will be supporting the investigation by conducting high-visibility patrols in and around the area where the attack took place.
"In addition, a police command vehicle will be in place at the scene and members of the public can attend at this unit to provide information, or speak with the officers out on patrol."
