Transport Scotland has said Skye's A87 trunk road is being monitored for any problems related to the disruption of ferry services to the Western Isles.

Four weeks of work that started on Monday to upgrade Ullapool harbour means only foot passengers are being taken between Ullapool and Stornoway.
Vehicles and freight must be taken to Uig on Skye to be ferried to the isles.
Skye councillor Drew Miller has raised concerns about the additional pressures this will place on the A87.
He told BBC Alba that more traffic than usual was using the trunk road.
Transport Scotland said it did not expect traffic to be "significantly higher" than normal when considered on an annual basis, or when compared to busy summer weeks.
A spokesperson added: "We are fully aware of the importance of the trunk road network to communities in this area and, like always, it will kept under regular review by our operating company during this period to ensure that any defects are detected and repaired as quickly as possible."
Ullapool harbour's 42-year-old linkspan is being replaced with a new two-lane structure to allow vehicles to move on and off ferries quicker.
