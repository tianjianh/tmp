[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Shahid Tarafdar, 45, was hit by a silver Peugeot 307 on Stockport Road at about 15:45 GMT on Tuesday.  He was taken to hospital but later died.
The car, registration number KW55 EVP, failed to stop and a passenger is shown on CCTV getting out and running off.
Footage then shows the driver mounting the pavement and going through a red light before turning right at Kirkmanshulme Lane.
The car was later found alight on Rimmers Close in Beswick, Greater Manchester Police said.
Mr Tarafdar's family said: "Shahid was a loving husband and a father to three young children. He was a devoted family man who was loved by his family and respected by the whole community."
His brother Shabuddin added: "We are in total shock and devastation."
Detectives have appealed for information and urge anyone who can identify the driver, or the passenger shown in the CCTV footage, to come forward.
Sgt Lee Westhead said: "It is only a matter of time until we find you. Come and speak to me before we come knocking on your door. This will not go away."
He warned anyone helping the driver this was not the time for "false loyalties" and police would prosecute anyone found to be involved in the incident.
