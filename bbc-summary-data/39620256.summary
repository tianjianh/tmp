Hannah Bladon killing: Derby County to hold minute's silence

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A minute's silence is to be held for a British student who was stabbed to death in Jerusalem.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Hannah Bladon, 20, will be honoured ahead of Derby County's game against Huddersfield Town later.
Rams fan Ms Bladon, from Burton-upon-Trent, was repeatedly stabbed on a tram in the Israeli city on Friday.
Derby County, who will kick-off at the iPro ground at 17:00, offered "sincerest sympathies to the Bladon familly".
Ms Bladon had been on an exchange programme at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem.
She was attacked close to Jerusalem's Old City, which was busy with Christians marking Good Friday and Jews celebrating Passover.
A 57-year-old Palestinian man, described by police as "very mentally disturbed", was arrested at the scene.
The University of Birmingham student's family, who described Ms Bladon as "a keen Derby County supporter", said they were "devastated" by the "senseless and tragic attack".
