Norwich City: Club fined by FA for failing to control players

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Norwich City have been fined Â£15,000 by the Football Association for failing to control their players in November's Championship defeat by QPR.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The fine relates to incidents in the second minute at Loftus Road, when Canaries full-back Martin Olsson was sent off for handling on the line.
Norwich, who have admitted the charge, went on to lose the match 2-1 on 19 November.
Alex Neil's Canaries are eighth in the second tier after five straight losses.
Meanwhile, Olsson has signed a new one-and-a-half year deal with Norwich, having played 122 times since his 2013 move from Blackburn.
