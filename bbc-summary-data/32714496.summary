Welsh Secretary Stephen Crabb said Lord Bourne will have a "key role in early delivery" of the Wales Bill as a minister in the House of Lords.
He replaces Liberal Democrat peer Baroness Jenny Randerson.
Mr Cairns is returning to the role he was first given in July 2014.
Announcing the new appointment, the Welsh Secretary said on Twitter that Lord Bourne has "enormous experience of Wales. Has a key role in early delivery of Wales Bill".
Lord Bourne was leader of the Tories in the assembly between 1999 and 2011.
More recently he helped lead the taskforce set up to help workers facing the axe at Pembrokeshire's Murco oil refinery.
His successor Andrew RT Davies added on social media that Lord Bourne was "vastly experienced" and will add much to the department.
Earlier, Mr Crabb said he was "delighted to be working" with his House of Commons Vale of Glamorgan counterpart.
On Monday, it was confirmed Mr Crabb was keeping his role in David Cameron's new Conservative government.
