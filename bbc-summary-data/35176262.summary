The woman in her 70s was declared dead at the scene after the Audi crashed into Costa on The Green, Westerham, Kent at 10:30 GMT.
South East Coast Ambulance (Secamb) said five more people were taken to hospital, four with serious injuries and one with minor injuries.
The A25 is closed in both directions while police investigate what happened.
Sally Pendleton, who is visiting Westerham for Christmas, arrived at the scene five minutes after the crash.
She said the car had gone through a plate glass window.
"We walked past and saw a car had just been lodged straight inside Costa Coffee," she said.
"There was a man still in the car and probably about 12 people by the side of the Costa looking very much in shock.
"There were a few people who had been hurt and quite a few elderly people as well.
"It's a horrible thing to have happened, on Christmas Eve of all days.
"Westerham is quite a quiet, sleepy area usually."
Secamb said a man and woman, both seriously injured, were taken by ambulance to St Georges Hospital in Tooting, south London.
Another seriously injured man and woman were taken to the Princess Royal Hospital in Farnborough.
A woman with minor injuries was taken to Tunbridge Wells Hospital.
Police have set up a witness centre at The Grasshopper public house in Westerham High Street.
Ch Insp Roscoe Walford said Kent Police did not yet know the exact cause of the crash, but the car driver appeared to have lost control of the vehicle before it crashed through the window.
Kent Fire and Rescue Service said it released two people from the car.
