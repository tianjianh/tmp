A top-five finish would have secured the title for Kent, who could become the first Briton in 38 years to win a grand prix motorcycle world title.
The race was won by Miguel Oliveira who is second in the standings, 24 points adrift of 21-year-old Kent.
Kent will win the title if he finishes in the top 14 in the final race in Valencia, Spain, on 8 November.
"It's a little bit frustrating," said Kent.
"It was clear that our bike was too slow, so I wasn't able to pass someone out of the slipstream.
"So we now go to Valencia where we need to score two points."
Britain's last grand prix motorcycle world champion was Barry Sheene in the 500cc category in 1977.
Wiltshire rider Kent made his grand prix debut in the 125cc class at the British Grand Prix five years ago.
