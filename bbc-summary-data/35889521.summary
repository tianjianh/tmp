A missing Hong Kong publisher who sold books critical of China's leadership has returned to the city, police say.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Lee Bo, who is a British citizen, was widely believed to have been abducted and taken to mainland China.
His disappearance last year with four other booksellers prompted an outcry and accusations that China had violated Hong Kong's judicial independence.
Mr Lee appeared on Chinese TV this month and denied being kidnapped. He gave Hong Kong police the same account.
The other booksellers also appeared on Chinese television, saying they were detained for "illegal book trading".
