The Swift Archway Cranford 545 caravan was stolen from a site in Yaxley, Cambridgeshire, on Thursday night.
On Sunday, Davis tweeted: "If you stole our caravan.. please can have we the sentimental items that are of no use to you? Special holiday memories."
Cambridgeshire Police is investigating the theft.
Davis, who played the role of Wicket in the third of the original Star War movies, took to Twitter on Friday following the theft.
He has since received sightings from other Twitter users, including a Lisa Wiles from Yaxley who on Saturday claimed it had been seen heading towards Farcet "trailing its wheel lock, sparks flowing".
Davis also tweeted that it was towed by a blue pick-up.
"Dear Twitter Friends," he added on Friday.
"Thanks for all your amazing support and help today re. my stolen caravan... you are all wonderful people! x".
The 3ft 6in (1.07m) actor said the thieves "didn't steal my sense of humour" after he was sent an image of a diminutive caravan.
Davis is also appearing in the forthcoming Star Wars: Episode VII.
His credits include Professor Flitwick in the Harry Potter films and Nikabrik in The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian.
Anyone with information about the caravan is asked to call Cambridgeshire Police.
