It was last in port a year ago with the Queen Mary and Queen Victoria to celebrate Cunard's 175th anniversary.
The ship arrived in time for a Service of Celebration at the Church of Our Lady and St Nicholas at 11:00 BST.
It was the first time a Cunard ship arrived in port skippered by a woman, with the line's first female captain Inger Klein Olsen, 43, at the helm.
Other elements of the celebration included two concerts plus a finale firework display, before the ship was due to depart at 22:22.
The Cunard building is one of the Three Graces on Liverpool's Pier Head waterfront, which is a Unesco World Heritage site.
