Lawyers have applied for a judicial review of the decision to close Conisbrough, Cedar and Thorne social education centres.
The centres provide day care and activities for people with severe learning difficulties.
Doncaster Council wants to shut them as part of a "modernisation" process to save the local authority money.
Martin Chadwick, whose daughter has used Cedar care home for 20 years, said he was considering joining the legal action.
He said: "It's crucial that Sarah goes to the centre, she needs it and we need her to go there for her health and wellbeing."
A hearing over the application for a judicial review is expected to take place in September.
Pat Higgs, assistant director of adult social care at Doncaster Council, said: "The decision in respect of the modernisation of day services was taken due to a number of factors, including the age, location and condition of the current buildings. "
