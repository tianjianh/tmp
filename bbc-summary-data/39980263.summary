The 25-year-old midfielder, who has agreed a four-year contract, will join for an undisclosed fee on 10 June.
He has made 32 appearances in the German Bundesliga this season.
"We are delighted that Pascal has opted to sign for us, amid interest from a number of clubs from the Premier League and Europe," said boss Chris Hughton.
"He offers something different to our existing midfielders, as an attacking midfielder in a more advanced position, operating behind the forward line."
Gross, who has scored four times this season as Ingolstadt were relegated, has created more chances than any other player in the Bundesliga this season.
