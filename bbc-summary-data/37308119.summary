[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Two men who kicked and punched a man outside a chip ship before stealing from his pockets have been jailed.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Edward Wood, 50, was injured near the Oceans Eleven takeaway on Railway Road in Leigh, Greater Manchester on 4 May and later died.
Kevin Darbyshire, 33, of Findlay Street, and Dwayne Turner, 28, of Railway Road, pleaded guilty to manslaughter at Liverpool Crown Court.
They were sentenced to 10 and nine years respectively.
The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) said Darbyshire kicked Mr Wood once to the head, and Turner punched him once under the chin as he sat in a doorway before they both stole items from him.
Mr Wood was "highly vulnerable" as he was sitting on the floor in a drunken state, David Graham, Senior Crown Prosecutor for CPS North West said.
"They accused him of spitting at them, before each delivering one violent blow to his head and face."
Darbyshire had a community order revoked after a separate incident so three years were added to his sentence.
That three-year term will run concurrently to his 10-year sentence.
