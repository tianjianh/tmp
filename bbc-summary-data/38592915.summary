The 46-year-old woman was struck by the car on Wilkinson Street in the Radford area of Nottingham on Wednesday evening.
She was taken to the Queen's Medical Centre where she remains in a serious condition, a police spokesman said.
The Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) is investigating.
IPCC commissioner Derrick Campbell said:"Our investigators have met with members of the woman's family to explain our role and our thoughts are very much with them."
He urged anyone who saw what happened to contact them.
"This happened during the busy rush hour and we know a tram and a bus had both stopped close to where the collision occurred, so there are many potential witnesses," he said.
Roads in the area were closed after the crash, which happened at about 18:45 GMT.
Supt Simon Firth, of Nottinghamshire Police, said: "Our thoughts are very much with the lady involved and her family at this difficult time."
