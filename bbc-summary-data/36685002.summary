A small station has been proposed for close to the Inverness Shopping Park.

The stop on the Inverness to Aberdeen line could be used by shoppers and people who work at the retail park.
It has also been suggested that students might also use the station to get to and from the nearby Inverness College UHI.
Highlands and Islands public transport body, Hitrans, has started exploring the potential uses and cost of the station.
The organisation already has proposals for a stop on the railway line close to Inverness Airport at Dalcross.
Stewart Nicol, chief executive of Inverness Chamber of Commerce, said a station at the shopping park could be well used.
He said: "We have got to continue to develop all forms of public transport across the Highlands.
"Part of the attractiveness of this is that there is a wide range of possible users. There are people who live and work in that part of the city, those who use the shopping park, the leisure facilities and the university campus."
Separate to the railway station plans, the shopping park is also set for a revamp following Highland councillors' approval of the new-look earlier this year.
