Colchester Hospital: Frank Sims takes over at NHS trust

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A new chief executive has been appointed to the NHS trust that runs Colchester Hospital.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Frank Sims will take over from interim boss Dr Lucy Moore in early December.
He is currently chief executive of Hounslow and Richmond Community Healthcare NHS Trust.
Mr Sims said he brought with him a "commitment to the long-term success" of the trust and hospital and was attracted by the staff's "determination to deliver positive changes".
The hospital had been under investigation since November 2013, when claims were made that data was changed to make it appear national guidelines were being met.
It was placed in special measures over "inaccuracies" in its cancer waiting times but Essex Police concluded "no criminal offences" had been committed.
Mr Sims said he had "faced and successfully managed similar issues to those at the trust and this is part of the attraction of this job".
He described his new role as "a huge opportunity to lead a unique organisation".
Trust chairman Alan Rose said: "With the appointment of a permanent chief executive and a clear improvement plan to address concerns raised by regulators, I believe we are starting to turn a corner in delivering safe, effective and personal healthcare for every patient, every time."
