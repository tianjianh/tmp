Javier Pastore's volley gave Laurent Blanc's side a half-time lead, as Lille appealed for offside.
Djibril Sidibe equalised with a free-kick, before PSG midfielder Adrien Rabiot was sent off.
Di Maria rolled in the winner as keeper Vincent Enyeama inexplicably charged 30 yards from goal to meet the winger.
Victory means that PSG remain on course for a clean sweep of domestic trophies, having won the Trophees des Champions and Ligue 1, and with the Coupe de France final against Marseille to come on 21 May.
Manager Blanc's future, though, remains uncertain because of his failure to take the club beyond the quarter-finals of this season's Champions League, where they were defeated by Manchester City.
Di Maria shot weakly at Enyeama in the opening seconds of an entertaining final at the Stade de France, with Lille looking the more dangerous side after surviving a difficult opening 10 minutes.
Frederic Antonetti's team had won six successive games going into the final, but went behind to a controversial goal five minutes before before half-time.
Pastore lashed a shot at goal as Lille struggled to clear a corner, with PSG full-back Layvin Kurzawa standing in an offside position inside the six-yard box as the ball flew into the net.
The officials ruled that Kurzawa was not active because he did not move towards the ball, but Enyeama believed that he was effectively prevented from diving to save the shot because the PSG man was in the way.
Lille responded positively, though, with Sidibe directing a free-kick into the corner of the net four minutes into the second half after Adrien Rabiot had been booked for fouling Sofiane Boufal.
Rabiot picked up a second booking, and was dismissed, for a late challenge on Boufal with 20 minutes left.
Lille, though, gave away a soft goal four minutes later, as Adama Soumaoro's weak back header allowed Di Maria to sprint on to goalkeeper Salvatore Sirigu's clearance, and the Argentian international nicked the ball past the onrushing Enyeama.
Soumaoro headed wide with a good chance to bring Lille level again, but PSG held on.
