Suffolk Police ends lost property service

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Police in Suffolk say they will no longer take in general lost property because most items are never reunited with their rightful owners.

Suffolk Police said the taxpayer paid for the 95% of never-claimed items to be stored or disposed of.
Police forces have no legal duty to provide a lost and found service.
Inspector Bob Cracknell, of Suffolk Police, said it would only accept items that relate to crime, contain sensitive details or pose a public threat.

"It is time to look at the practicalities of lost and found property," he said. "The constabulary handles a large amount each year and it costs a significant amount to process."
The idea has been criticised by some residents on the BBC Suffolk Facebook page.
Clara Hines said not being able to hand in valuables to the police was "not very good way of teaching kids" while Simon Rigo suggested it would mean a "finders keepers" society.
