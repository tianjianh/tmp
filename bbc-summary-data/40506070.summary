A £1m retail development in Gretna has secured significant investment from the Royal Bank of Scotland.

The bank will put £555,000 towards the project by property firm Crucible Alba Group.
Part of the site has already been leased to supermarket Co-op Food on a 15-year deal.
Developers said the project - which sits on the main route between Gretna and Annan - would create jobs in both towns.
Brian Robinson, development director at Crucible Alba Group, said: "The town of Gretna is a popular tourist destination, with a strong motorway link and an already well-established shopping village nearby.
"We are extremely grateful to Royal Bank of Scotland for the funding.
"For many years, this development lay vacant, but now offers a high-quality retail facility for the area."
Iain Robertson, relationship director at Royal Bank of Scotland, said it was "proud" to support the scheme.
"It is great to see investment going into the Gretna area and rewarding to know that new jobs and amenities are to be created for the community," he said.
