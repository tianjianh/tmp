A Carmarthenshire road has reopened earlier than planned after work to repair a fractured pipeline finished ahead of schedule.

The A48 westbound between Nantycaws and Carmarthen was closed for maintenance work on Friday after thousands of litres of kerosene leaked into Nant Pibwr, but was reopened on Sunday.
The main section of pipeline across the A48 was moved into place on Saturday.
The pipeline carries aviation fuel and diesel from Pembroke's Valero refinery.
Valero had originally said the road would open on Monday.
A spokesman had said on Sunday they were carrying out tests to ensure there were no further oil leaks.
He added: "We continue to work with Natural Resources Wales to minimise the risk to the environment and to keep the impact on the wildlife to a minimum."
Mid and West Wales Fire Service has used a drone to monitor traffic during the A48 closure.
Ch Insp Peter Roderick, of the specialist operations department for Dyfed-Powys Police, said: "The fact we are in a position to re-open the westbound carriageway hours earlier than expected is excellent, and a relief to all, especially those planning to travel on Monday morning.
"There have been very little problems on the diversion routes throughout the weekend, and this is largely due to the understanding, patience and co-operation shown by the public and road users. I would like to sincerely thank everyone for this response."
