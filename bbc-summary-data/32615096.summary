German court overturns ban of Russian pro-Putin bikers

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A Berlin court has ruled that bikers said to be from the Russian nationalist Night Wolves group can enter Germany to commemorate the defeat of the Nazis 70 years ago, overturning a previous ban.

A group of bikers intended to ride from Moscow to Berlin, but Poland barred entry at the border with Belarus.
Germany's federal police then also refused entry over security fears.
The pro-Kremlin group is subject to US sanctions for alleged active involvement in Crimea.
It is accused of helping to recruit separatist fighters for Russian-backed rebels in eastern Ukraine.
Night Wolves leader Aleksandr Zaldostanov had told Russian media Germany's decision to refuse entry was a "political decision".
Before the bikers arrived at the Polish border, more than 10,000 Poles had taken to Facebook to protest against the Night Wolves entering the country.
The group backs Russian President Vladimir Putin's policy of support for separatist rebels in eastern Ukraine in their armed conflict with the Ukrainian government - something strongly opposed by Poland.
The Polish government described their plans as "provocative".
On Wednesday, a Berlin court ruled there was not enough evidence they were a threat to public order, domestic security or international relations.
Of the dozens of bikers that left Moscow on 25 April, mainly on Harley-Davidsons, it is unclear how many have found their way to Germany and what route they have taken.
They had planned to cross Belarus, Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Austria, before reaching Berlin on a 6,000km (3,720 mile) trip following the path taken by the Red Army in World War Two.
The group's aim had been to arrive in the German capital in time to coincide with Victory Day celebrations in Moscow on Saturday.
