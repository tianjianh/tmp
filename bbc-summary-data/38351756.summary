A group of 60 volunteers and family and friends of a missing airman have scoured a forest looking for evidence he could have been hit by a vehicle.

Corrie Mckeague's mother Nicola Urquhart asked Suffolk Lowland Search and Rescue to provide expertise on the search of about five square miles (13 sq km) of land.
No evidence was found in the search but the campaign will continue, she said.
The 23-year-old was last seen in Bury St Edmunds on 24 September.
The airman, originally from Dunfermline in Fife, was based at nearby RAF Honington.
He was escorted out of Flex nightclub in Bury's town centre and was spotted several times on CCTV but the trail went cold after he entered a dead end road.
Andy King, from the search group, said: "We set out to find any evidence that he may have been hit by a vehicle while trying to get back to the airbase and his body was somewhere along the route."
Ms Urquhart, who said she had no intention of giving up looking for her son, thanked the many people who came to help.
They were split into six groups to undertake different parts of the search in King's Forest between the air base and Barton Mills.
She also said hundreds more had volunteered but she had asked only a select few to take part in the search, which began just after dawn on Saturday.
