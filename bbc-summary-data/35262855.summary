Night Tube: Are we on the brink of more strikes?

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
It is a zombie policy. The Night Tube idea is now just wandering around doing nothing much apart from causing trouble.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
At the very earliest it could perhaps be introduced in the summer.
But I have not met one person who will give you a start date, such is the drift on this once flagship project.
And there is hardly any outrage that the plan has slipped and now I'm told we are the brink of more Tube strikes.
Talks over pay and conditions around the Night Tube have not been resolved - the last time London Underground (LU) and the unions got together on this was in November.
Some 180 part-time train drivers are being recruited for the Night Tube without the agreement of the main unions - the RMT, ASLEF, TSSA and Unite.
There were also discussions over ticket office closures and staff redeployment on new rotas - what's known as Fit for Future - and they have failed.
There are other numerous outstanding issues the unions don't like over the new rotas that are meant to start on 7 February.
All of these issues mean more industrial action - probably with the support of the main unions - are likely very soon.
The unions' executives are due to meet next week to decide the next course of action.
And what will be particularly interesting is how the mayoral candidates will react to any announcement of more Tube strikes.
