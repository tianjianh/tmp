The former England captain was player-coach at Gloucester last season but has not been offered a new contract.
The 35-year-old centre, who joined Gloucester from Bath in 2005, won 75 caps for his country.
"It wasn't a hard decision in the end. It was a case of staying another year at Gloucester or retiring," he told BBC Radio 5 live.
"I didn't want to go and play at another club so it was an easy decision."
After 17 years, it's time to retire from rugby. I have been lucky to play with/against some great players, and two great clubs.

Tindall's decision comes four days after former team-mate and close friend Iain Balshaw became the penultimate member of the 2003 World Cup-winning side to retire.
Tindall, who captained England in 2011, played 181 games for Gloucester and had considered continuing as a coach at Kingsholm, prior to the sacking of director of rugby Nigel Davies in May.
"I've had 17 years in the game, so I thought it might be nice to have a bit of time away to see if I wanted to still be in the environment, or out doing something else," added Tindall.
"There's personal ambitions I'm sad about missing. I would have loved to have said I was at a club for 10 years, but it doesn't always work out the way you want it to.
"No way would I change anything or feel sad about anything.
"I can say now I've done eight years at Bath, which I loved, and had nine fantastic years at Gloucester. I can be really proud of those times and I think it's the way I wanted it to finish."
