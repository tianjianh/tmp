"Moaning Myrtle's full name was Myrtle Elizabeth Warren," the author tweeted on Monday.
A fan had inquired via Twitter about the ghostly witch who appeared in the books.
Ms Rowling quickly denied that the namesake had anything to do with Ms Warren, a well-known Democratic senator from Massachusetts.
Fans asked on Twitter whether Rowling made up the name on the spot. She replied that she already knew Warren was Myrtle's last name, but she said Elizabeth because it is a "classic British middle name".
Rowling said she laughed at the idea that Myrtle would be named after Ms. Warren.
