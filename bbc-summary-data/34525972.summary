[SN]TITLE[SN]
Guernsey Police Sgt John Tostevin given community service

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A police sergeant who registered a car in his own name after telling its owner it would be used for emergency service training has been spared a jail term.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
John Tostevin, 49, admitted 10 offences including forging vehicle documents and computer misuse and data protection crimes at Guernsey Magistrate's Court.
The former traffic sergeant was given 150 hours of community service.
His defence argued the trauma caused by dealing with incidents and fatalities should be taken into account.
Judge Phil Robey said Tostevin's ill health was the only reason he avoided a prison sentence.
In summing up he said: "An offence of dishonesty by a police officer should attract an immediate custodial sentence, except for exceptional circumstances.
"Apart from that he would not have escaped prison. The impact of the offences on public confidence is serious."
The court heard how Tostevin had faked official documents in order to obtain car number plates, which are owned by the States but the right to use them can be sold and accessed personal information without permission.
He was sentenced to complete 150 hours of community service for each of the offences, but told they would run concurrently.
Tostevin was also ordered to pay Â£200 to the owner of the car he had taken, having told her it would be used for emergency service training but registered in his own name.
Ahead of the sentencing he resigned from a 30-year career in the island's force, during which he headed up the police traffic section for many years leading road safety campaigns and investigating road traffic collisions.
Defence Advocate Andrew Ayres read out glowing references from two former police chiefs and told the court Tostevin had received numerous commendations for his police work and was suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) when the offences occurred last year.
He told the court Tostevin was "always at the coal face", and had witnessed many traumatic incidents and fatalities and had suffered a death in the family leading to PTSD and him acting as recklessly as he did.
