The north-west team won just four of their league matches this season and finished bottom of the standings with 21 points from 38 games.
"Following a meeting on 27 April, the committee has decided to relieve Paul Kee of his duties as team manager," the club said in a statement.
The 48-year-old was in his second spell with the Riverside Stadium club.
The former Coleraine and Crusaders midfielder returned to Institute in 2011 following a first stint in charge from 1999 to 2002.
"It is with much regret that we come to this decision and we would like to thank Paul for his efforts and wish him all the best in the future," added the club.
It was a brief stay in the top-flight for Institute after their promotion as Championship winners in 2014.
Kee has also managed Carlisle and Limavady United, and he worked for the Irish FA as a county performance coach and Northern Ireland U17 manager.
