Birmingham City 1-2 Bournemouth

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Bournemouth came from behind for their first win of the season as they saw off Birmingham and their former boss Harry Redknapp in the EFL Cup second round.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Blues went ahead when a corner was headed across goal by Jonathan Grounds and Maikel Kieftenbeld slotted home.
But Ryan Fraser met Adam Smith's low right-wing cross to level for the Premier League side after the break.
Marc Pugh secured the Cherries' place in round three when he drove the ball home after being set up by Lys Mousset.
It means Bournemouth, yet to score in the league this season, have kept up their remarkable record of having never lost at St Andrew's in 10 league and cup visits.
