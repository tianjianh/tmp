The former Bradford City midfielder, 36, had managed the team since 2013 and led the club to promotion in May 2015 before a 20th-placed finish last term.
"Struggling at the foot of the National League table, the board felt a change was necessary," a club statement said.
Bower's assistant, Danny Boshell, has also been dismissed, with defender Adam Lockwood taking interim charge.
