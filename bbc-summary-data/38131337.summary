One way people can send us images is via social media using #EnglandsBigPicture.
The BBC England team noticed tags that incorporated doodles or sketches in photographs.
This gallery highlights some of those pieces of artwork - all of the contributors used social media to share their work.
If you have a picture you'd like to share, email us at england@bbc.co.uk, post it on Facebook or tweet it to @BBCEngland. You can also find us on Instagram - use #englandsbigpicture to share an image there. You can also see a recent archive of pictures on our England's Big Picture board on Pinterest.
When emailing pictures, please make sure you include the following information:
