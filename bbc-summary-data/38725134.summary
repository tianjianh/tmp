Patrick Roberts believes his loan spell at Celtic will prepare him for the challenge of trying to break into the Manchester City first team.

The 19-year-old moved to Glasgow a year ago and has played in more than 40 games for the Scottish champions.
His 18-month deal ends in the summer and Roberts intends to return to City to battle for a place.
"I'll always have that belief; the more you play, the more you improve," said Roberts.
"It's been my first proper season playing men's football. I did a bit at Fulham, but I was in and out, the same at Man City, so coming here, the manager before [Ronny Deila] played me a lot and Brendan's [Rodgers] been really good with me as well.
"It's been good and I'm thoroughly enjoying it.  I came here to improve, to win trophies and score goals.
"Hopefully at the end of the season I can take that back with me to City and have a good go there. It's been a great experience and I'm thankful for that."
Roberts has often found Scott Sinclair and James Forrest starting games ahead of him this season, but the winger says he has learned from working alongside Sinclair in particular.
He also insists that the camaraderie within the squad has been a significant factor as Celtic reached the Champions League group stages and have put together a run of 25 unbeaten domestic matches.
If Celtic can avoid defeat against St Johnstone on Wednesday, they will equal the record of 26 set by the Lisbon Lions in the 1966-67 season. Roberts, though, insists that the players are not giving too much thought to the record.
"The team spirit's been great since day one, when the manager came in and the boys came back for pre-season," he said.
"We've kept each other going, we've had good times, fun together, and done well on the pitch. It shows in results and if we continue to do that, it should be a very good season for us.
"It's [about] momentum, you feel good, positive and go into every game believing you can win. The more you win, the more positive you are. We're in good stead right now and we'll go into Wednesday firing and ready to go.
"We're just going out with the mentality to win every game. On Wednesday we'll show that again. We'll be buzzing to be back in the league and looking to put on a good show.
"It's more other people [looking at the record], we just focus on trying to win. We'll do all we can to do that and focus on the game."
