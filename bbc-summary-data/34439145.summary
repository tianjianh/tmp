The man - identified as a 30-year-old surnamed Pang - was held in the southern Guangxi region and brought back to the capital, Xinhua said.
Pang made a 37.5km lap around Beijing in 13min and 43 sec, driving three times faster than the official limit.
A video of his feat in August soon became an internet sensation in China.
In April, two men crashed a Ferrari and a Lamborghini as they staged what reports said was a "real-life Fast and Furious" race in the capital, referring to the film franchise.
The drivers were later sentenced to five and four months in jail.
