[SN]TITLE[SN]
First Welsh tax law for almost 800 years gets Royal Assent

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Legislation on the Welsh replacement for stamp duty land tax - the first new Welsh tax law for almost 800 years - has entered the statute books.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The law, which has been given Royal Assent, establishes a new land transaction tax, which will replace stamp duty from April 2018.
First Minister Carwyn Jones said the act was a "significant step" for devolution.
Rates of the new tax are due to be announced by October this year.
Assembly members approved the Land Transaction Tax and Anti-avoidance of Devolved Taxes (Wales) Bill earlier in the year.
Stamp duty is paid when property or land is bought over a certain price.
Officials previously said that the document was the longest piece of legislation Welsh ministers have produced.
