Norwegian Pettersen, an eight-time Solheim Cup participant, was receiving treatment for a recurrent back injury but withdrew on Wednesday morning.
Matthew, 47, who was appointed as vice-captain last month, will now be a playing member of the squad.
"I found out this morning and I feel ready," she told BBC Sport.
"I had the inkling that this could have happened since I got here so I've been preparing a little bit. It's nice to know finally that I'm in."
The event takes place at the Des Moines Country Club in Iowa from 18-20 August.
Matthew, from North Berwick, has played in eight Solheim Cups between 1998 and 2015, earning 19 points from 33 matches.
She was a member of three winning teams in 2003, 2011 and 2013.
She famously holed the winning putt in 2003 at Barseback Golf and Country Club in Sweden and secured the half-point to win the Cup outright to seal Europe's first away victory at Colorado Golf Club in 2013.
"I thought this was my last chance to play in a Solheim Cup," added Matthew.
"I was enjoying my role as vice captain and had accepted it. But it's now changed slightly so I just need to refocus.
"It's fortunate that I've played in so many Cups before and I know what to expect. I played the course yesterday, normally the reserve or the vice-captain doesn't get to do this."
Europe captain Sorenstam said: "Catriona is a proven Solheim Cup performer who will be able to step right in and play with anybody. She's ready to go."
The USA are the current holders of the Solheim Cup after winning 14½-13½ in Germany last year.
The 2019 Solheim Cup will be returning to Scotland at Gleneagles.
