The anniversary of the end of a strike by women who wanted to earn a fair wage is being marked.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
In 1910, women chainmakers in Cradley Heath, West Midlands, went on a strike which lasted for 10 weeks, and ended on 22 October.
The action has been credited with changing the lives of thousands of workers earning poor wages.
The anniversary is being marked with events including a procession through the town to unveil a memorial plaque.
The plaque, in honour of strike leader Mary Macarthur, will be unveiled at the Mary Macarthur Memorial Gardens.
