[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Gerard McSorley, 66, who played Father Todd Unctious in the show, was charged with causing criminal damage to the flower pots at Bunbeg in June.
Originally from Omagh, County Tyrone, McSorley did not attend a hearing in July and an arrest warrant was issued.
A Dungloe District Court judge applied the Probation Act to him on Tuesday.
The court heard that Bank of Ireland manager Marion Boyle called the police to her branch of the bank in Bunbeg following the incident.
"He left after roaring and shouting at Ms Boyle and damaged a flower pot outside the bank," a police inspector said.
The inspector added that McSorley, of Cul Na Toinne, Magheraclogher, Bunbeg, made a full admission and apologised.
A defence solicitor said plastic flower pots were involved and she was not sure of the value, but that McSorley had 40 euros compensation for Bank of Ireland.
She added: "He is very calm and well-liked in Bunbeg."
McSorley has starred in a variety of films including Braveheart, The Constant Gardener and Veronica Guerin.
