His works drew from his own experiences of life in South Carolina.
He is recognised as a leading figure of the 20th Century's literature of the American South.
Several of Conroy's novels were made into films.
"The water is wide but he has now crossed over," his wife, Cassandra King, said in a statement issued via his publisher.
She said Conroy died on Friday evening.
