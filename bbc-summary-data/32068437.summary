[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The general election offers Wales an "unprecedented opportunity", Plaid Cymru's leader will say on Friday.

Launching the party's campaign, Leanne Wood will argue electing the largest ever group of Plaid MPs would put Wales in the "strongest position possible" as polls point to a hung parliament.
She will address party activists in a rally at Ffos Las Racecourse in Trimsaran, near Llanelli.
Plaid Cymru currently has three MPs and has never had more than four.
On Thursday, the party warned SNP election gains could divert resources to Scotland, with Plaid's campaign coordinator Lord Wigley arguing a "strong group" of his party's MPs would be needed to stop Wales losing out.
