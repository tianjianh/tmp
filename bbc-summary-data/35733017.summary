Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink recorded his first back-to-back wins as QPR boss with a comfortable win over Brentford.

Junior Hoilett opened the scoring by unleashing an unstoppable effort from the edge of the box.
QPR's lead was doubled when Tjaronn Chery's perfectly-weighted ball found Sebastian Polter, who slotted underneath David Button.
Chery secured the three points shortly after with a composed finish, his fourth goal in four Loftus Road games.
The Rs remain in 11th despite their west London derby win, while the Bees stay 17th.
Brentford's best chance came straight after Hoilett's opener, but Ryan Woods' fierce strike from long range struck the base of the post.
Former centre-back Dean Smith will be concerned with his Brentford side's defence, which has now conceded 12 in the last four away games.
The result sees QPR win three home games in a row for the first time since 2014.

QPR boss Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink: "We were very well organised, not really in trouble, and we defended well. I'm very happy with the performance.
"Junior took the goal really well and then after that you get a little more positivity and you can do certain things - you feel freer.
"You can't just control a game with the ball, you have to be able to suffer without the ball as well, and we did that."

Brentford manager Dean Smith: "I thought the game turned on the second goal. There should have been a free-kick and they scored.
"We lost confidence after that. With the results we've been having, confidence is low.
"Goals change games and the second goal changed it. We always believed we were in it."
