Surrey opener Rory Burns hit his second Championship century of the season on an even first day against Hampshire.

They lost Dominic Sibley and Kumar Sangakkara at The Oval, with both well taken behind the stumps by wicketkeeper Lewis McManus.
Burns remained watchful in overcast and humid conditions, reaching his hundred off 205 balls with a six and 15 fours.
He departed four deliveries later, caught off Brad Wheal for 101, before bad light play with Surrey on 260-6.
After Sibley (11) and Sangakkara (26) departed, Arun Harinath was caught for nine as he sent a mistimed pull off South African Ryan McLaren to Wheal.
And the home side slumped to 144-4, with Wheal taking his first scalp of the day as Steven Davies was caught in the slips by Will Smith.
However, Burns passed 5,000 first-class runs as he reached his half-century and after two interruptions for bad light, he hit Wheal for a four and six as he went to three figures.
The pace bowler got his revenge in his next over to dismiss Burns but wicketkeeper Ben Foakes' unbeaten 47 saw Surrey past 250 before the light forced the players left the field for the third and final time.
Surrey are third in Division One and need to win to keep in touch with leaders Middlesex, who are 16 points ahead of their London rivals, having played one fewer game.
Hampshire are 14 points adrift of seventh-placed Durham, who have a match in hand, and safety.
Surrey batsman Rory Burns told BBC Radio London:
"It's done quite a bit and to be where we are in the game, we're pretty happy with it, and the next target is to push on to 300 in the morning.
"It was very humid, which helped the ball swing all day, and the pitch was quite fresh as well. It was a good contest.
"I've had a couple of near misses in recent times so to get there (to a hundred), I'm really chuffed.
"It would have nice to go massive, but in the context of the game, that could prove to be a really big score."
Hampshire coach Craig White told BBC Radio Solent:
"It was another frustrating day. On that pitch, in the conditions we had, I don't think we bowled as well as we could.
"We bowled a couple of decent balls in an over, then bowl a poor ball and just release the pressure.
"We got better as the day went on, but if we'd done that first session we could have been batting tonight.
"Saying that, with a new ball first thing tomorrow, if we bowl well, we could bowl them out for 280, that's be the aim."
