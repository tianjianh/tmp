Earlier this month, while hosting the team at State House, President Museveni promised to reward each of the players and officials for reaching the Nations Cup after 39 years of waiting.
"Yes, 30 players and six officials have received their payment," Uganda FA President, Moses Magogo told BBC Sport.
Magogo thanked the President for the good gesture and promised that the national team and the federation will continue to work hard to develop and promote football.
Magogo also explained that six other players and four officials have not received the payment, despite their account details being sent in.
The FA President said the authorities who were handling the payments in the President's office had reduced the numbers.
Among the players to miss out are defenders Hassan Wasswa Mawanda and Nicholas Wadada.
"I have not received my money yet, but I have been told they are working on the matter so that I receive the money," Mawanda told BBC Sport.
Although President Museveni had promised to give out US$15,000 each, the ministry of Education and Sport clarified that US$10,000 had been paid out, with an aim to pay out US$15,000 in the future to match other nations' rates.
Uganda is the only country in the Cecafa region to have qualified for the 2017 Nations Cup.
The Cranes are also in the group stages of the 2018 Fifa World Cup qualifiers.
