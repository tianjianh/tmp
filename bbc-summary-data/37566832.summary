A man who confessed to murdering his partner in a text to his brother has been jailed for life.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Anne-Marie Nield, 44, died after suffering multiple injuries at a flat in Oldham Road in Rochdale in May.
Richard Howarth, 42, of Lincoln Drive in Littleborough, must serve a minimum of 15 years after pleading guilty to murder at Bolton Crown Court.
Police were alerted following text messages to his brother in which he admitted killing her.
He had returned from the pub before he began arguing with Ms Nield and then "viciously attacked" her, police said.
Ms Nield's family earlier said she had a "popular nature" and would be greatly missed.
