[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Giovanni Simeone, 21, gave his side a 47th-minute lead in a 1-1 draw with Pescara on Sunday.
Rey Manaj, on loan from Inter Milan, cancelled out the Argentina Under-20 international's opener with five minutes remaining.
Simeone, born in Madrid, joined the Italian club from Argentina's River Plate in August.
Manaj's equaliser came with Genoa reduced to nine men, after Edenilson had been sent off for a second booking and Goran Pandev was shown a straight red card for dissent.
Genoa have eight points from their first five league games of the season, seven behind leaders Juventus with a game in hand.
