Hollywood couple Justin Timberlake and Jessica Biel are suing Heat magazine in the High Court in Dublin over an article published last month.

The couple, who have been married for two years, claim they were defamed in the European edition.
"We have issued defamation proceedings on behalf of our clients," said international media lawyer Paul Tweed from Johnson's law firm.
The company will represent the couple in Europe.
"We are suing in Ireland in relation to publication in all jurisdictions, as our clients are entitled to do," added Tweed.
He also said the case was unlikely to be heard before the middle of next year.
In September, the magazine published an article and photographs of Timberlake and appeared to quote Biel in the article.
Separate defamation proceedings in each of the stars' names were lodged earlier this week at the High Court against the publishers of Heat, Bauer Consumer Media.
Bauer is the German-based publisher of Heat and a range of other titles.
The couple got married at the Borgo Egnazia resort in Puglia, Italy, in October 2012.
