NI Assembly set to meet for the first time since new executive formed

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Northern Ireland Assembly is meeting for the first time since a new team of ministers was appointed to the power-sharing executive.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The executive was formed last week after independent unionist MLA Claire Sugden was appointed as justice minister.
The other posts are shared out between the two biggest parties, the DUP and Sinn FÃ©in.
The UUP and SDLP are forming an opposition.
Both parties turned down ministerial roles in the executive.
The Alliance Party also refused the opportunity to join the executive after it was offered the justice minister role.
The UUP and SDLP have not yet said if they will work closely together in opposition.
SDLP leader Colum Eastwood said his party would look to be a "positive and constructive opposition, not opposition for opposition's sake".
Mike Nesbitt, the Ulster Unionist leader, said that the move into opposition would "lead to new beginnings and possibilities for devolved government".
