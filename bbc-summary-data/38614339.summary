William Liversage, 50, of Birkenhead, filmed jurors on a phone during the trial of a member of his family at Carlisle Crown Court in October 2014.
It is believed he was plotting to scare jurors and had a collection of masks including of a werewolf.
Liversage denied perverting the course of justice but was found guilty during a trial. He was jailed for three years.
The hearing at Carlisle Crown Court was told that the father of four was arrested while driving away from the court and his van was searched.
In addition to the rubber masks, recording equipment and a GPS tracker were found.
The trial of the family member was later halted.
Sentencing Liversage, Judge Barbara Forrester said she presumed he had hoped to be able to identify a juror and intimate them to interfere with the trial of the family member.
Prosecutor Brendan Burke said: "The Crown would say this crime was considered, organised and sophisticated and - were it not stopped - extremely frightening to whoever was going to be confronted at the end.
"We did say that confrontation would have happened, wearing one of these masks; which from one standpoint may be considered trivial or amusing, but in a confrontation of that nature very far from it."
