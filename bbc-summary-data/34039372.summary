Borders Railway campaigners claim key tourism role

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Borders Railway campaigners have said they helped to avoid embarrassment for the Scottish government by highlighting the route's tourist potential.

They pressed for extra capacity at Tweedbank to cope with charter trains.
The Campaign for Borders Railway said that an original "downbeat verdict" could have seen "an embarrassingly sub-optimal offer" for tourists.
The Scottish government said it had included communities and campaigners in the process of reopening the line.
The route between Edinburgh and Tweedbank in the Borders is to reopen next month.
CBR's UK Parliamentary Officer Nick Bethune said that a feasibility study in 2000 had not recognised the tourist potential of the route.
He said that, alongside the Waverley Route Trust, his organisation had argued "long and hard" for a bigger role for the railway.
He said research and lobbying, along with the efforts of MSP Claudia Beamish had prompted the "eleventh-hour decision" to authorise the extension of Tweedbank to accommodate 12-coach tourist charter trains.
He added that the scenic qualities of the route between Edinburgh and the Borders had since been "enthusiastically endorsed" by the transport minister at the time Keith Brown and former First Minister Alex Salmond.
"Our view is that the combination of a half-hourly ScotRail service plus charter trains from across Britain will be enormously attractive to the tourist market," he said.
He said it could bring "substantial new spend" to the Borders economy and Midlothian.
Mr Bethune also highlighted other tourism-related enhancements to the original rail specification which have been secured by CBR's campaigning.
He said those included saving the original Stow station building from demolition, better window and seat positioning and enhanced luggage and bike space.
"The reality is that if it hadn't been for rail campaigners' efforts this new railway would have provided an embarrassingly sub-optimal offer to the tourist market," he added.
A Scottish government spokesman said that, with less than two weeks until reopening the line, the excitement was now "palpable" along the route.
He said that the feasibility study in 2000 had been delivered under a previous administration.
However, he said that a "groundswell of interest" had allowed this government to "broaden the scope of the original plans" and "maximise the potential" of the line.
"The Borders Blueprint committee formed by former First Minister Alex Salmond is already working to exploit the full potential of the new railway once it's operational," he added.
"It has been important to the Scottish government to include the communities and campaigners throughout the process.
"We look forward to celebrating the opening with them just two weeks from now."
