A jury considering verdicts in a long-running historical sex abuse trial at Mold Crown Court has been sent home for the day.

It has heard some victims were passed around a group of men at the Wrexham home of Gary Cooke, 64, in the 1980s.
Mr Cooke and six co-defendants deny a range of sex offences against boys aged 10 to 15.
The trial began in April, with the jury starting deliberations on Monday.
The men were charged following an investigation by the National Crime Agency under Operation Pallial.
