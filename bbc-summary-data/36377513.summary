[SN]TITLE[SN]
Man who superimposed own face on child abuse images is jailed

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A pensioner who superimposed his own face on to child sex abuse images has been jailed for a year.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
James Boyack, 70, will also be monitored in the community for two years following his release from prison.
Police officers raided his home following a tip-off and recovered child abuse and other images and videos.
Boyack was placed on the sex offenders register for 10 years at Dundee Sheriff Court.
Specialist officers reviewing the material found pictures of children being abused where Boyack had added his own face over the top of the men seen in the images.
Depute fiscal Eilidh Robertson told the court that following his arrest on those charges in October 2014, Boyack moved from Dundee to Stirling's Bannockburn Road.
That home was raided in June 2015 and Boyack was again found in possession of child abuse material.
The court heard  that Boyack was convicted of almost identical offences in 1998.
Miss Robertson told the court: "He fully admitted having downloaded indecent images of children.
"He stated that this behaviour made him feel ashamed and that he would frequently wipe his computer's memory to remove the temptation, before downloading further images.
"The internet search history of the laptop was consistent with the accused actively searching for indecent images of children."
The court was told that eight devices with a total of 194 indecent images and 18 indecent videos of children were recovered, as well as 262 extreme pornographic images.
Boyack, now of Inverness, pleaded guilty to charges under the Sexual Offences (Scotland) Act.
Defence solicitor Iain Myles said: "He recognises that these are serious offences.
"He has told me that he is in no position to make excuses for his behaviour.
"He indicates that he needs help and realises this is totally and utterly unacceptable behaviour."
Sheriff Lorna Drummond QC jailed Boyack for 12 months and imposed a two-year extended sentence on his release.
The sheriff said: "The number of images you had, the time period in which you downloaded them and your previous conviction are all highly relevant.
"It is an aggravating factor that you superimposed these images and deleted them to try to conceal the evidence.
"It is clear to me that in a situation like this, and where you have a previous conviction, custody is inevitable."
