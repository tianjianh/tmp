[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The driver hit another car, which was stationary, in Eskbank Road, Dalkeith on Wednesday. Police stopped a Vauxhall Vectra on the A6094 near Tesco's Hardengreen store a short time later.
The 45-year-old driver was charged with driving under the influence of drugs and failing to stop.
Cannabis was found in the car and he was charged with drugs possession. He will appear in court at a later date.
No one was injured in the collision.
Insp Neil Mitchell, of Police Scotland, said: "Driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs puts not only the driver, but other road users at risk and such offences will not be tolerated.
"Road policing officers regularly monitor all main arterial routes and any motorists found to be driving in a manner that puts the public in danger will be appropriately dealt with."
