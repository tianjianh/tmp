[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Derry Flynn McCann, 28, launched a two-hour assault "within sight" of his victim's front door in Hackney, east London, on 13 January.
He had only recently been released from prison for a "remarkably similar" crime.
A judge at Snaresbrook Crown Court described McCann as "a monster" and said he must serve at least 9 years.
During the "sustained and systematic" rape, McCann beat, raped and humiliated the woman, took photos of her and stole her mobile phone.
McCann, of Hackney, had pleaded guilty to three counts of rape, one count of sexual assault and one count of robbery, at an earlier hearing in the same court in March.
Honorary recorder Martyn Zeidman told the rapist at that hearing he had carried out a "terrible" crime and faced a "very, very long time" in prison.
Detectives believe he had been following another woman but lost sight of her so began stalking his victim, eventually pulling her into undergrowth.
It is understood the teenage McCann was jailed in 2006 for carrying out another prolonged rape.
