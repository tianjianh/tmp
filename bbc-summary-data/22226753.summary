Dione Brennan, 25, was being treated at the Bradgate Mental Health Unit when the incident happened in May 2012.
Mary Lloyd, Ms Brennan's aunt said: "We feel very disappointed and let-down."
A coroner at the inquest into Ms Brennan's death found no evidence of gross failure by the unit.
Coroner Donald Coutts-Wood said he could not be sure Ms Brennan had intended to take her life and that the care she had received had been appropriate.
He recorded a narrative verdict.
Afterwards, Dione's mother, Sandra Lloyd said: "What's the point of her being in a supposedly secure unit to come and go as she pleases, when a week before she tried to commit suicide?
"I feel as if there was no point in me taking Dione to the hospital.  I could have kept her at home. I  could have done what there were doing."
The Leicestershire Partnership NHS Trust said it had made significant changes to its care.
