Inspectors also found staff at C Cassidy and Sons in Hucknall, Nottinghamshire, handled cooked and raw meat, creating a risk of cross-contamination.
Christopher Cassidy, 53, admitted 10 hygiene breaches.
He was fined £1,500 and ordered to pay costs of £4,671.
Ashfield District Council told Nottingham Crown Court Cassidy had several chances to fix problems.
During a series of visits between September 2015 and July 2016 - which included the shop being briefly closed and given a zero hygiene rating - inspectors found multiple breaches.
These included surfaces and many fixtures and fittings, including towel dispensers, hand soap dispensers and chiller door seals, being found in a poor and dirty condition.
Nicolle Ndiweni, of Ashfield District Council, said food hygiene was of utmost importance.
"In this case, there was a complete lack of basic cleaning and good food hygiene practices were not followed. Preparing food in a dirty environment is not just bad practice, it can lead to serious illness or even death.
"Ashfield's Officers made every effort to work with Mr Cassidy to see improvements made, but had to act in the interests of public safety when issues raised were left unaddressed", she said.
