Wales set the Women's Six Nations alight as they beat world champions England for only the second time in their history.

After a first half that saw the Welsh edge ahead through the boot of Laurie Harries in the Swansea sunshine, prop Catrin Edwards powered over for their first try.
And following three penalty misses by England's Megan Goddard, Elinor Snowsill sent Welsh wing Laurie Harries over in the corner to seal a famous victory.
"It was absolutely amazing, it's got to be one of the most special days of my life," said Edwards. "It just showed that with some belief we can do it."
England were without 14 of their World Cup winners, with two retired and 12 playing at the World Rugby Women's Sevens Series.
Having been crowned world champions last year, however, they were expected to win at St Helen's.
In the first half, both sides had kicks at goal but neither England's Goddard nor Wales' Harries could capitalise on their opportunities.
A strong maul characterised Wales' efforts, as the forwards appeared to have the better of their English counterparts.
Meanwhile, English debutant Sydney Gregson was targeted all afternoon under the many high balls sent down her left wing.
The deadlock was broken on the half-time whistle as Harries slotted from in front of the posts to give the home side a 3-0 lead.
The Welsh try came five minutes into the second half after a long period stalking the English try-line.
It was finished off by prop Edwards, who charged her way through the English defenders.
The Scarlets' tight-head prop was a towering presence throughout the match with her work in the loose.
England's Goddard saw two more penalty attempts sail wide before Wales sealed the win with a fine score.
Harries got on the end of a perfectly-weighted kick from Snowsill and raced over the line to the delight of the Swansea crowd.
Wales coach Rhys Edwards: "It was so pleasing how we conducted ourselves and closed the game out.
"They're still a formidable team and if I'm honest we really had to dig deep in defence and we knew that's been our weakness in the last couple of years.
"We had to make our tackles and I'm so pleased the girls stuck at their job and did the simple things well and kept England out."
England interim coach Nicky Ponsford: "We're obviously really disappointed by the result but I have to give credit to Wales.
"That's probably one of the best Welsh performances I've seen. They played really well today, they didn't allow us to create a platform and attack in the way we wanted to attack."
