The 22-year-old, who was linked with a move away from Bolton in January, was out of contract and had been offered new terms by manager Dougie Freedman.
But the Serie A outfit confirmed that Alonso has signed a three-year deal.
Alonso, who joined Wanderers from Spanish giants Real Madrid in 2010, scored four goals in 30 appearances during the 2012-13 campaign.
Freedman has already added a left-back to his squad ahead of next season with  when his contract at Norwich expires later this summer.
