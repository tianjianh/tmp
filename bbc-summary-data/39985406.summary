The 38-year-old was approached by the men as he returned to his silver Skoda in Buchannan Park in Stepps at about 17:40 on Friday.
They demanded his car keys and, when he refused, the men produced weapons and hit him on the leg.
They then drove off along Cumbernauld Road towards the M80. Police have appealed for witnesses.
The first man is described as white, in his late teens or early 20s, 5ft 7in to 5ft 10in tall, of medium build with short black hair and stubble.
He was wearing a black fleece with an orange AGGREKO emblem, dark trousers and dark shoes.
The second man is described as white, in his late teens or early 20s, 5ft 8in to 6ft tall, of slim build and with fair hair.
He was wearing the same fleece as the other man, dark trousers and dark shoes.
Det Con Thomas Kiernan, from Coatbridge, CID said: "This was a terrifying ordeal for the victim and extensive inquiries are under way to trace the despicable individuals responsible.
"I would appeal to anyone who was either in the car park or the surrounding area, who may have seen two men matching the above descriptions acting suspiciously to get in touch.
"I would also ask anyone who may have seen a silver Skoda driving at speed along Cumbernauld Road to come forward as you may be able to assist with our inquiries."
The robbery follows two similar attacks in Glasgow and Airdrie earlier this month.
Three armed men stole a man's car near Glasgow Royal Infirmary on Monday 8 May.
The following day, a man was assaulted and robbed of his car by two armed attackers in a car park at Monklands Hospital.
