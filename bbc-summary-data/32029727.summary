Jennifer Lawrence says she won't be playing shape-shifting mutant Mystique any more in the X-Men prequels.

The Oscar-winning actress says she's giving up the role when asked by a reporter at the premiere of her new movie, Serena.
She told MTV: "It is my last one, actually."
Lawrence started playing a younger version of Mystique in X-Men: First Class in 2011 and reprised her role in last year's X-Men: Days of Future Past.
Her final film as Mystique will be X-Men: Apocalypse, which is out next year.
With a number of new mutants appearing again - Cyclops (Tye Sheridan), Jean Grey (Sophie Turner) and Storm (Alexandra Shipp) - the time could be right for Lawrence to step away from her role.
Former Skins actor Nicholas Hoult, who played the Beast in X-Men: First Class and X-Men: Days of Future Past, has also suggested he won't be part of the franchise after Apocalypse.
He told E! Online that he wasn't signed up for any more films although he didn't rule out a return.
An older Mystique was played by Rebecca Romijn in 2000's X-Men and 2003 sequel X2 and X-Men: The Last Stand in 2006.
She's a member of Magneto's Brotherhood of Mutants and frees him from his plastic jail cell.
But she's turned into a normal human being after being shot in X-Men: The Last Stand and is abandoned by Magneto.
