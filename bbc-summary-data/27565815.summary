Elliot Rodger, 22, stabbed three male room-mates and shot three people in a rampage that ended with his own death.
Shortly before the attacks, he posted a video on YouTube railing against women. He is also reported to have posted similar sentiments on online forums.
In response, Twitter users began using the #YesAllWomen hashtag - originally a response to traditional male rights activists' complaints - to debate the issue.
The hashtag was used by more than 250,000 people in less than 24 hours. By 26 May it had been tweeted 1.2m times and had and 1.2bn impressions, according to hashtag.org.
Some social media users sparked anger by appearing to sympathise with Rodger's bitterness at being rejected.
In response, other users started commenting on the treatment and experiences of women.
Many highlighted everyday scenarios that they said showed discrimination and abuse.
Some users took to Twitter to express support.
But many complained that they had been targeted by internet "trolls" for expressing their views.
Meanwhile, several other hashtags have appeared offering differing opinions in reaction to the comments, including #notallmen and #yesallmen.
