Authorities in the US say the 24-year-old is tentatively booked on a BA flight to London.
The plane was forced to land in Boston after the man allegedly became unruly.
Massachusetts State Police said he would be summoned to appear in court accused of interfering with the flight crew of the Boeing 777 at a later date.
U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CPB) said in a statement: "A 24-year-old Scottish man  is tentatively booked on a Sunday British Airways flight departure to London.
"Privacy laws prohibit CBP from revealing the subject's identity or details of his admissibility review.
"The Massachusetts State Police (MSP) has issued a summons to the subject for interfering with a flight crew. The summons requires him to return to Massachusetts for a court appearance."
A British Airways spokeswoman said: "Our customers and crews deserve to enjoy their flights, and not to suffer any form of abuse.
"Disruptive behaviour will not be tolerated, and the appropriate action will always be taken.
"We'd like to apologise for the delay to the other customers on the flight."
