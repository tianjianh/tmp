Martha Gakonde, 39, from Wythefield, was killed on 9 September 2011 in a crash at Broadmayne, Basildon, Essex.
The hearing at Chelmsford heard her Toyota Yaris had pulled out in front of the fire engine, which had its blue lights and sirens on.
The inquest was adjourned until October.
The fire engine was one of two responding to a report of a traffic accident.
It was travelling at up to 45mph on the dual carriageway, the inquest heard.
Driver Tariq Khan told the hearing that as he passed the stationary Toyota, Ms Gakonde swerved out in front of him.
The inquest heard the driver of the fire engine following him said there was nothing Mr Khan could have done.
Mother-of-three Ms Gakonde had been returning home after dropping her daughter off at school, the hearing was told.
