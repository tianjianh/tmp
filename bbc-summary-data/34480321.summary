Politicians urged to give mental health care equal treatment

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Mental health should be as much of a priority as physical health for Welsh political parties, according to the Royal College of Psychiatrists.

Its chairman in Wales, Professor Rob Poole, said many with mental health conditions were unhappy with services or were not seeking treatment.
The body has launched a manifesto for the 2016 assembly election, demanding "parity of esteem".
The manifesto was launched on Friday, a day before World Mental Health Day.
It says Wales' seven local health boards should have directors dedicated to mental health and learning difficulties.
Prof Poole warned people were not getting the help they needed despite "dedicated health professionals and staff working hard to meet increasing demand".
"What is needed now is strong governance and leadership to create world class mental health service provision that Wales can be proud of," he said.
