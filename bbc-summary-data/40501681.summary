Holyhead 'without EE mobile signal' for three weeks

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
EE mobile phone customers in an Anglesey town claim they have been left "cut off" without a phone signal for three weeks.

More than 130 people have joined a Facebook group claiming to have limited or no signal in Holyhead.
Gavin Malone, who set up the group, said they have been told there is a fault with a mast based at the town's fire station.
EE has apologised and said it was working to fix the problem.
Mr Malone said the problem appeared to be limited to Holy island, with users able to regain signal on the Anglesey mainland.
He said more than 100 people had made complaints but no-one could get a firm answer on when the problem would be fixed.
Mr Malone said the lack of signal was not only inconvenient, but he was worried it could put vulnerable people, such as the elderly or disabled, at risk if they could not call someone if they were in need.
"My partner is expecting a baby and I really want to be in contact with her," he said.
Mr Malone, who pays EE Â£120 a month for two mobile phone contracts, said he and other customers had been advised to make calls using their home wi-fi signal but said that was only a short-term fix.
He said: "As soon as you leave your house you've got no signal so you phone becomes a landline.
"It's three weeks with no signal, it's pathetic. A whole town to be out is not on. People do depend on it."
Some affected customers on the Facebook group said they had been offered refunds on their bills but Mr Malone said he was not willing to accept one until the problem was resolved.
An EE spokesman said: "We are aware of the technical issues that have been affecting some customers in the Holyhead area and have been working to fix these.
"Our engineers have fixed one mast and are replacing hardware on the second mast to restore full service as quickly as possible.
"We apologise for any inconvenience caused."
