Andrea Dossena: Leyton Orient sign ex-Liverpool defender

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Struggling League One side Leyton Orient have signed former Liverpool, Napoli and Sunderland full-back Andrea Dossena until the end of the season.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 33-year-old Italy international was a free agent after leaving the Black Cats at the end of last season.
Dossena, who can also play in midfield, scored against Manchester United and Real Madrid while he was at Liverpool.
He could make his debut for the O's in Saturday's FA Cup first-round fixture against Oldham.
Dossena joined Liverpool for Â£7m in July 2008 and scored in the Reds' 4-0 win against Real Madrid in the Champions League in March 2009 and then again in their 4-1 away victory at Old Trafford against Manchester United.
The Italian, who won 10 caps, joined Napoli in January 2010 before a spell at Sunderland in 2013-14.
Orient are 20th in League One after only winning one of their last eight league games.
