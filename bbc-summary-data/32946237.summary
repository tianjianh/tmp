Italy's Berlusconi mistakenly backs rival candidate

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Former Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi accidentally lent his support to an opponent, after turning up at the wrong political rally.

Mr Berlusconi arrived at the gathering in a square in the town of Segrate, outside Milan, with his bodyguards.
He asked someone for the name of the candidate, and then encouraged people to vote for him.
"Vote Paolo," he said - only to be told the man was standing against Mr Berlusconi's Forza Italia candidate.
Paolo Micheli, a leftist who is running for mayor, later joked on his Facebook page that Mr Berlusconi's endorsement meant he was sure to win.
Mr Berlusconi quickly left after being made aware of the mistake by his aides. Forza Italia's mayoral candidate, Tecla Fraschini, was holding a campaign event at a nearby hall.
People across Italy are going to the polls on Sunday to elect regional governors town mayors.
Mr Berlusconi, 78, was prime minister three times between 1994 and 2011.
He announced plans for a political comeback earlier this year, after the country's highest court upheld his acquittal on charges of underage sex and abuse of office in March.
However, several cases against him are still slowly advancing in Italian courts.
Mr Berlusconi remains banned from running for office and Forza Italia faces growing challenges for conservatives votes.
