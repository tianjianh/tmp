A man has been jailed for nine years for knocking down a police officer who tried to stop a stolen car.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
PC Gareth Browning, 33, was on foot in Whitley, Reading on 30 November when he was hit by a black Mazda Aerosport driven by Luke Haywood, 28.
Haywood admitted causing grievous bodily harm with intent and dangerous driving at Reading Crown Court.
PC Browning was critically injured and remains in hospital in a serious condition.
Haywood, of no fixed address, had previously admitted aggravated vehicle taking and one count of going equipped to burgle.
He is currently serving a prison sentence for separate burglary offences.
PC Browning was attempting to stop the stolen vehicle, driven by Haywood in Shinfield Road, when he was injured.
Det Supt Chris Ward said: "No sentence can ever reflect the injuries that PC Browning received as a result of Haywood's reckless actions. PC Browning was doing what thousands of police officers do every day - protecting the public from dangerous criminals.
"I hope that today's sentencing can allow Gareth's family to begin to come to terms with what has happened. We all wish Gareth a full recovery."
