South China Sea tribunal: Key points

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An international tribunal has dismissed China's claims to much of the South China Sea.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague said there was no evidence that China had exercised exclusive control over the waters or resources historically.
China has said it will ignore the tribunal's findings and defend its interests.
Here are the key points from what the tribunal said:
China called the ruling "ill-founded" and said it would not be bound by it.
In a statement, the Chinese foreign ministry said China was the first to have discovered and exploited the South China Sea islands and relevant waters, "thus establishing territorial sovereignty and relevant rights and interests".
