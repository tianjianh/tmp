Pewdiepie comments on turning off YouTube comments

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The amount of news articles about Pewdiepie turning off the comments on his YouTube channel, were, in the vlogger's own words, "insane".

He has now announced that he is meeting up with the video-sharing site to discuss how to "improve the comments".
"The point was that comments and feedback that actually matter were lost in an endless sea of spam," he posted on Twitter.
Pewdiepie originally announced the move in a video on his YouTube channel.
He told his 30 million subscribers: "I go to the comments and it's mainly spam, it's people self-advertising... I don't care about it."
After taking a break from any interaction, he made the decision to "turn the comments off forever".
Pewdiepie, whose real name is Felix Kjellberg, made his name commenting on video games.
Last year YouTube attempted to tackle the problem of popular videos attracting spam comments, links to adverts and rival accounts.
In his video earlier this week, Pewdiepie claimed the site had not been very successful.
"It's been bothering me for so long now, I've been trying to find solutions to it, hoping it would get better... but it doesn't seem like it and I'm just sick of it.
"I just want to connect with you bros. That's all I care about. If you bros aren't with me, what's the point?"
YouTube have yet to comment on Pewdiepie's actions.
