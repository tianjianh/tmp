The event, held to a three day format for the second year, drew a crowd of about 17,000 people.
Two Door Cinema Club, Super Furry Animals and The Darkness were among the other big names to perform over the weekend.
The festival is held on the Belladrum Estate near Beauly in the Highlands.
Long established music acts such as Gun and the Dangleberries performed, but also new acts such as The Mermaids.
As well as music, the event festival featured street trials cyclist Danny MacAskill's Drop and Roll show, children's entertainers Funbox and also wrestling, Hula Hoop performers and computer coding challenge that involved moving Lego robots around an obstacle course.
Bella benefited from mostly fine weather, though there were spells of heavy rain on Saturday night.
Sunday, when thousands of people pack up their tents before heading home, has seen high-speed gusts of wind.
The Met Office has a weather warning in place and has described the high winds as "unseasonable".
Just south of Beauly in the Cairngorms, BBC Weather said a gust of 103mph had been recorded over the summit of Cairngorm mountain.
