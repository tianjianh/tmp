[SN]TITLE[SN]
Oldham Athletic 0-0 AFC Wimbledon

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
AFC Wimbledon stretched their unbeaten away run to eight games with a goalless draw at Oldham.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Dons have not lost on their travels since the opening day of the campaign, while Oldham have still managed only one home league win all season.
Both sides created chances in an even first half, with Wimbledon keeper James Shea doing well to deny Billy McKay at his near post.
Wimbledon should have scored on 31 minutes, but Jake Reeves was kept out by Connor Ripley's excellent save after breaking clear inside the box.
Oldham threatened again when Ryan McLaughlin crossed to Lee Erwin, whose downward header was beaten out by Shea.
In the 61st minute, Dons midfielder Dean Parrett fizzed a long-range free-kick inches wide of the post.
Wimbledon's Tom Elliott glanced a header over the top before Shea parried a 25-yard blast by Ollie Banks.
Oldham went desperately close to an 89th-minute winner, but Shea touched a Charles Dunne header on to the crossbar before Freddie Ladapo's follow-up also hit the woodwork.
Report supplied by the Press Association.
Oldham manager Steve Robinson told BBC Radio Manchester:"We were brave in the last 25-30 minutes of the game, we carried the game to them and had numerous chances.
"It wasn't to be, but we're having shots on target and some good attacking play around the box,  we need to to do that for 90 minutes.
"Freddie (Ladapo) is convinced it went over the line, but it's a very difficult decision for the referee, there were a lot of bodies around.
"We're still a very new side, trying to progress. People want overnight success, it's an X Factor world, everyone wants to click their fingers and get it, but today I thought our fans were very patient with us."
