Organisers shared the YouTube video, shot at the festival in August. It shows a panel discussion between Viohni and other vloggers, on social media.
They then posted Twitter messages apologising for the error.
Subsequent tweets claimed this video had been "pre-uploaded" and they had meant to remove all "offending videos".
They added: "This one appears to have slipped through the net. It will be off the channel very soon."
Viohni has been accused of "sexual misconduct".
Two women told Channel 4 News that they had been sexually harassed by Viohni, who goes by the online name VeeOneEye.
In a video, which he has since made private on his YouTube account, he responded to the accusations, saying: "I'm not going to deny it. I'd just like the chance to explain myself."
He claimed that while growing up he had not been taught about responsible behaviour towards sex and alcohol.
"I didn't have anyone there to tell me that it was the wrong thing to do," he said.
"I've messed up and I just want everyone to know that that's not the person that I am any more."
No police charges have been filed against Viohni.
Summer in the City is an annual event which takes place in London. Popular YouTubers hold talks, gigs and meet-and-greets with their fans.
After their apology, Summer in the City's organisers sent a separate tweet about the future of the festival.
"We would also like to reiterate that we will not welcome abusers at any future Summer in the City events.
"Also, if you feel the need to question why these people are banned, you should probably question your own attendance at YouTube events."
They also shared a video of musician Will Dixon, adding: "Here's a video from a good member of our community!"
