The son of a man murdered at home five months ago has said his family is "demoralised" by the apparent lack of progress in the investigation.

David Brickwood, 74, was stabbed five times in Northampton on 26 September in a "violent and dreadful" attack.
One of his sons, Dale Brickwood, said the family was becoming "increasingly frustrated" the killers had not yet been brought to justice.
Police said the case was "a priority" they were "committed" to solving.
Mr Brickwood was attacked when several men broke into his Lindsay Avenue home in the early hours of the morning.
He was left with multiple stab wounds to the head, leg and hand.
The scrap metal dealer was known to keep money in his house.
His son Dale said the family was not sure how much was taken but during a Crimewatch reconstruction on 8 February police appealed for "anyone [who has] come into contact with a large amount of old style £20 and £50 notes" to come forward.
His son said watches and jewellery were also taken.
The offenders would have been "covered in blood", officers said, but despite that, no-one has been charged.
Two men arrested shortly after the murder were released with no further action. Three other men remain on bail.
Mr Brickwood criticised Northamptonshire Police for a lack of communication, saying: "We seem to be finding information and giving it to them."
The police "don't really talk to us", he added.
Northamptonshire Police said two family liaison officers had been assigned plus a "dedicated team of detectives".
Det Ch Insp Mick Graham, leading the investigation, said: "I can fully understand that the family and friends of David may be frustrated.
"The investigation team share that frustration and empathise with David's family."
He said there was "a lot of rumour and speculation locally",  but added: "We need the people with the critical pieces of information and evidence to come forward."
However, the family has been left "so demoralised" after the recent Crimewatch appeal failed to lead to further arrests, Dale Brickwood said.
"It's disgusting. Five months after our dad was murdered and no-one's been caught. Where do we go from here?"
Crimestoppers has offered a £10,000 reward for information leading to the arrest and conviction of those responsible.
