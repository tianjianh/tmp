A naming ceremony, where Ms Jenkins was also presented with a commemorative medal, took place on Monday.
It comes weeks after the mezzo soprano, who is expecting her first child, was asked to sing at the Queen's 90th birthday celebrations.
Ms Jenkins is the third person to be honoured by the railway, along with Bryn Terfel and Sir David Brailsford.
She said: "I'm so grateful to everyone at Snowdonia Mountain Railway for honouring me in this way.
"I'm so disappointed we didn't reach the summit but I look forward to coming back with my family and new baby daughter."
Last year, more than 130,000 people travelled on the railway, which is the only one of its kind in the UK.
