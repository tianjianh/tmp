National League club Woking have made their entire playing squad available for loan moves.

Manager Garry Hill informed his players of the decision following Saturday's FA Cup fourth qualifying-round 3-0 defeat by Maidenhead United.
"Garry addressed all of the players and told them exactly where they stand," chairman Mike Smith told BBC Surrey.
"Saturday's performance fell far, far below what Garry deserves and what the football club deserves."
The Cards are 16th in the table and the loss at the weekend means they have won only one of their last eight matches.
But Smith remains fully supportive of former Dagenham & Redbridge boss Hill, who has been in charge at Kingfield for almost five years.
Smith said: "The players have been left in no doubt about what it should mean to be a player at Woking Football Club.
"A circular has gone out making the entire squad available for loan.
"If they don't want to contribute then we'd be quite happy for them to go and ply their trade somewhere else.
"Garry remains focused on delivering the best he can and is dedicated to the cause."
