[SN]TITLE[SN]
Northamptonshire police commissioner to pay car mileage

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Northamptonshire's Police and Crime Commissioner Adam Simmonds says he will not be claiming any car mileage from public funds.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Mr Simmonds has faced criticism for employing assistants when other commissioners had not done so.
He will not claim the Â£3,000 he expects to spend running his privately-owned car on business this year.
The commissioner said it was the only car he used for work as he was not provided with an "official" car.
Mr Simmonds said: "In terms of personal travel in my own car, I won't claim for mileage, purely to be really straightforward and simple so that people who see me travelling around know I'm paying my own costs.
"I get a good government salary [police commissioners get Â£70,000 a year] and I don't want to be an added burden."
