Sectarian song accused banned from attending football matches

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A teenager accused of singing a sectarian song on his way to a Scottish Premiership tie has been banned from football matches ahead of his trial.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 17-year-old, who cannot be named, has denied committing the offence before Dundee United's game against Hearts in February.
Prosecutors allege he engaged in behaviour that was likely to incite public disorder.
The alleged offences took place in Dundee's Union Street.
It is alleged the teenager, from Edinburgh, sang a sectarian song and made sectarian remarks.
He pleaded not guilty to the charge at Dundee Sheriff Court.
David Duncan, defending, said the teenager had been released on bail at an earlier hearing and asked that his bail be continued.
Sheriff Alastair Carmichael set a trial date for June.
He allowed bail on the condition that the teenager does not attend any regulated football match in the UK ahead of the trial.
