Gladys Hooper celebrated her milestone on 18 January with family and friends on the Isle of Wight.
Thousands of people sent the former concert pianist birthday messages online and through the post.
She said: "Thank you very much. I'd like to say how much I appreciate it. I send my love and great thanks to everyone."
She added she was looking forward to her next birthday.
A video of her talking about seeing a German airship being shot down over London during World War One has been seen by 850,000 people.
The Facebook post by BBC Radio Solent reached almost three million people and generated more than 1,500 comments.
The great-grandmother, who lives at Highfield Nursing Home in Ryde, is the country's most senior supercentenarian, according to the Gerontology Research Group records.
Her son Derek Hermiston, 85, said cards and gifts were still flooding in a week after the event.
People from the US, Canada, Belgium and Australia wrote her birthday wishes on Facebook.
Hallie Mae Richards-Monroe wrote: "The amazing history you have witnessed in your life time. Happy Birthday from New York USA."
Ann Foley wrote: "Such an amazing lady, I thank Mrs Hooper for sharing her memory of that night way back in 1916, during the Great War."
Mr Hermiston said his mother had also met Thomas Edison, who demonstrated his "new lamp" at her school, and had been flying with aviatrix Amy Johnson.
