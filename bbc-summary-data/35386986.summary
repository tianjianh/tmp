About 100 residential and business properties in St Michaels, Churchtown and Garstang were flooded in December.
Water levels peaked in the River Wyre due to heavy rainfall, which heaped pressure on temporary flood defences.
Wyre Council is now urging residents to share their experiences to "shape" flood risk management in the area.
The council said residents with sandbags should keep them in a dry place, preferably off the ground, for future use.
During the floods about 20 homes in St Michaels were evacuated after the Environment Agency issued a severe warning.
Councillor Roger Berry said: "We appreciate how important flood protection is for Wyre."
A drop-in community roadshow, which also includes the Environment Agency and the area's fire service, is being held in St Michaels on Wednesday.
