United were denied victory over Arsenal at Old Trafford as substitute Olivier Giroud headed an 89th-minute equaliser after Juan Mata's opener.
They have now won just one of their past six Premier League games.
Mourinho said: "I have nothing to say against my players, but I feel sorry for them because we feel like a defeat and Arsenal is feeling like a victory."
He added: "If we just focus on [draws against] Burnley, Stoke and Arsenal - nine points easily. If we had those six points more we are top four and close to the top of the league."
"We all know inside that in this moment we are the unlucky team in the Premier League."
United remain sixth in the league table, five points behind fourth-placed Arsenal who are two points behind leaders Liverpool.
The draw means Mourinho remains unbeaten against Arsene Wenger in 12 meetings in the Premier League.
However, he has now faced Manchester City, Liverpool, Chelsea and Arsenal in the league this season and not recorded a win.
When leaving his post-match news conference, Mourinho added: "Finally I lost against Arsenal. That is the feeling I take home. Finally I lost against Arsenal."
Giroud's late goal, the visitors' first effort on target, saw Arsenal extend their unbeaten run to 17 games in all competitions, following an opening-day Premier League defeat by leaders Liverpool.
"I felt overall we had a serious defensive performance, offensively we have played better," said Gunners manager Wenger.

"We had not our usual style to go forward. We were not sharp or fluent enough. Manchester United blocked us well as well, they were very organised.
"In the second half we came out in the first 20 minutes and we didn't play. Deservedly Manchester United led 1-0, but they dropped off and gave us the ball again. We were resilient and in the end I think we scored a great goal."
