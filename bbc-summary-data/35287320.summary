Homes plea for dumped Exeter Christmas hamsters

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An appeal has been launched to home 14 hamsters dumped outside a block of flats in Exeter days before Christmas.

The Syrian hamsters were taken to the RSPCA's Little Valley centre but so far only two have been rehomed.
Because of the time of year they were left, staff have given the furry creatures biblical names, including Noah, Elijah, Moses and Sampson.
The RSPCA said it was keen to get information about the "rather callous" owners.
The animals were found in four clean cages on King Street on 21 December.
Animal welfare officer Steve Powell said: "It was rather wet that day and yet someone had left this large family of Syrian hamsters out in their cages in the cold to fend for themselves.
"It looked as though they had been looked after generally as they were in a reasonable condition, the cages were clean, and they had food, but this does not take away the fact that this was a rather callous act to just leave them outside like this to brave the elements.
"The reality is that, had they not been found, this could have been a very different and potentially sadder story.
"A few of the hamsters also had injuries, probably due to fighting as Syrian hamsters are solitary animals - so the fact that so many were being kept like this, together, in four cages was irresponsible.
"We are seeking more information about what might have happened here to these poor creatures and would encourage anyone who knows anything about where they might have come from or about their previous owner to please come forward."
