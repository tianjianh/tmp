Atkinson, 19, won the historic title in the 50m butterfly by nine hundredths of a second at the British Swimming Championships in Sheffield.
The Loughborough University student said she was "buzzing" to win gold.
Her winning time of 26.81 seconds was outside the consideration time for the World Championships but was a new Manx record.
Sophie Yendell finished nine tenths of a second behind Atkinson, with Alys Thomas third.
Atkinson's achievement comes nearly 50 years after Alexandra Jackson won her last British title in the pool.
The Dublin-born swimmer represented the Isle of Man during her career and won her last title in 1968.
Jackson was the first Manx woman to win a Commonwealth Games medal, taking bronze in the 200m freestyle in 1970, and competed at the Mexico Olympics.
Isle of Man Swimming manager Leonie Cooil said Atkinson's triumph is a "fantastic achievement which provides a real boost for Manx swimming".
She added: "To be our first British champion for than half a century is a very special achievement. It's a piece of history and she is the first-ever Manx-born champion."
National Swimming coach Lee Holland added: "We always knew she had the potential and she has really worked on all aspects of her racing.
"We couldn't be more proud of her achievements - it will be like the (Mark) Cavendish effect and inspire all our young swimmers."
Atkinson is the reigning Isle of Man sportswoman of the year.
