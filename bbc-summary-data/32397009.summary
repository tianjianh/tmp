Seven top policemen have been suspended in Kenya following an inquiry into security failings during the militant attack on Garissa's university.

It comes after reports that police ignored warnings that the campus in the north-eastern town could be raided.
A further investigation would establish possible criminal culpability of those suspended, the interior minister said.
Islamist al-Shabab fighters killed 148 people during the day-long siege earlier this month.
Most of those who died were students at Garissa University College.
The BBC's Ferdinand Omondi in the capital, Nairobi, says there has been public outrage and calls for action over the alleged security failings.
Universities across Kenya had posted memos warning students of possible violence before the attack happened, our reporter says.
The principal of Garissa University College is reported to have requested in vain for additional security at the campus.
Two civil servants were also suspended including Garissa County Commissioner Njenga Miiri.
He was previously in charge of Lamu county when al-Shabab gunmen shot dead anyone who was unable to recite verses from the Koran in an attack last June.
The attack on the university earlier this month was the worst in the country to date by the Somali-based al-Shabab group, who are affiliated to al-Qaeda.
