Cornish Pirates coach Gavin Cattle says he is pleased with how his squad is shaping up for next season, with 19 players already under contract.

Only two are new signings as it stands, with Christian Judge and Toby Freeman adding to Cattle's existing personnel.
"Ultimately our main aim was to retain as many of these boys as we could," Cattle told BBC Radio Cornwall.
"That's what's maybe set us apart from some teams in the league, that we've been able to retain those players."
Aside from former Germany international Rob Elloway, who will retire this summer, Pirates have not lost any players for the 2017-18 Championship campaign.
They could yet make this season's play-offs, with the team two points below fourth place ahead of their trip to bottom side Richmond.
"There's always going to be a few casualties [departures] due to the player's choice or the club's choice," added Cattle.
"We're pretty fortunate that we have had that retention of players so we haven't had to do that big turnover like in the past.
"I'm really pleased to be doing that because it's pretty clear to see we've got a real committed bunch who really play for the shirt, so that can grow that bond a bit stronger."
