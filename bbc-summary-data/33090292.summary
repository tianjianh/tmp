The child was struck by the vehicle on Wednesday at about 19:20 BST on Station Road in Purton, near Swindon. He died at the scene.
The 56-year-old driver of the roadsweeper, who was travelling towards Hook, was not injured.
Wiltshire Police asked anyone who may have witnessed the accident or has any information to contact them.
Supt Andrew Carr said it was "an absolute tragic accident".
He said he did not believe the roadsweeper had been operating at the time and said it was "one of the larger ones you'd see clearing the gutter".
