Pregnant MP Natalie McGarry faints in parliament

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A pregnant MP has been treated by ambulance staff after fainting at Westminster.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Natalie McGarry is understood to have become unwell during prime minister's questions, and an ambulance was called.
She later tweeted that she was expecting a baby, and that medical staff had been called as a precaution after she fainted.
Ms McGarry was elected as the SNP MP for Glasgow East in 2015 but now sits as an independent.
She was charged by the police last year over allegations of fraud relating to potential missing funds from two pro-independence groups.
Ms McGarry was well enough to return to parliament to vote against the snap general election planned for June.
