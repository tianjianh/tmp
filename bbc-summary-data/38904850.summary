Ben Jones gave Wales a 13-0 lead with a try, conversion and penalty early on but Harry Randall took a superb kick-and-go to cross and claw England back.
Max Wright got England's second try to put them ahead before Will Butler extended the lead at the break.
Chris Coleman crossed to set up a tense finale but Zach Mercer sealed it.
The result was England's second bonus-point win in the competition, after they beat France in their opening match.
Meanwhile, Wales slipped to defeat at home a week after they beat Italy U20s 27-5.
Wales had won their last eight matches in the Under-20s Six Nations, while England now extend their winning streak to seven games in all competitions.
Jones put Wales into a commanding lead early on as he scored all of their 13 points prior to England's breakthrough.
Randall touched down before half-time as the visitors began to take control, but Coleman's try gave Wales hope of recording a comeback.
Man of the match Mercer, however, powered over at the other end soon after to make sure of victory for England.
