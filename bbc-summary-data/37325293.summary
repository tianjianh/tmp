Coventry City 0-0 Oldham Athletic

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Coventry are still looking for their first win in League One after being held to another goalless draw by Oldham.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The hosts had the better of the first half but, once again, struggled to turn that dominance into goals.
Jodi Jones had a couple of efforts miss the target, while Marvin Sordell finished the best move of the game with a scuffed shot that drifted wide as the home side tried to break the deadlock.
Oldham midfielder Paul Green saw his low-range strike deflected wide 10 minutes before the break and then fired the ball over the crossbar from the resulting corner.
The best opportunity of the period fell to Coventry's Marcus Tudgay on the stroke of half-time - but he headed Lewis Page's inch-perfect cross wide of the target.
Impressive Sky Blues full-back Jamie Sterry was carried off on a stretcher at the start of the second half after taking a horrible blow to the head and that cleared the way for Oldham to have their best spell.
Ollie Banks and Green both fired over for Latics, while striker Lee Erwin, who was quiet in the first half, smacked against the bar from the edge of the box.
Banks had two efforts saved by Reice Charles-Cook as the visitors sensed they could claim a late win but Coventry finished the stronger of the two as eight minutes were played out with each side awarded a point.
