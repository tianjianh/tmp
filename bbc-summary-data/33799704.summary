A Coventry teenager is calling for a meeting with the government about the kidnap and rape of women by so-called Islamic State (IS) forces in Iraq.

Rozin Khalil Hanjool, 17, who escaped the country in 2008, is a Yazidi, one of the religious minorities being persecuted heavily by the militants.
She has started a petition, which has attracted 150,000 signatures, to get the government to provide more support.
The government said it was already working with the Yazidi community.
Miss Hanjool said more than 3,000 Yazidi women and girls had been kidnapped by IS in northern Iraq.
"They have been raped and tortured by their captors," she said.
"I know girls as young as 12 have been taken. If I was there now I would be so, so scared."
She said that, while some women had managed to escape, they were scattered in refugee camps and getting little help.
"They are scared and traumatised, some are pregnant," she said. "They need medical help, psychological support and rehabilitation."
Her online petition calls on Home Secretary Theresa May, Secretary of State for International Development Justine Greening and Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond to meet with the Yazidi community in the UK and prepare an action plan.
"These girls may seem far away, but they need our help," she said.
"The support from everyone who has signed that petition means a lot. I just want these women to recover."
Yazidis worship a peacock god which, in the eyes of IS, make them a valid target for extermination.
The Department for International Development said: "Aid from the UK provided blankets and heating stoves for tens of thousands of families so they could survive the winter.
"We continue to provide protection and support to Yazidi women and girls who are at risk of violence."
