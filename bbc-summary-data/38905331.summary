A head teacher has been banned from the profession for falsifying students' progress records.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Simon Pringle, former head of Brinsworth Manor Junior School in Rotherham, was found guilty of "unacceptable professional conduct" by a misconduct panel.
He produced false data that showed pupils attainment was "good" prior to a visit by inspectors in 2014.
Mr Pringle was prohibited from teaching indefinitely, but can appeal.
The school said it suspended the teacher in April 2015. He resigned in September 2015.

The National College for Teaching and Leadership panel heard Mr Pringle had "admitted that he drafted false lesson observation feedback for some teachers" including some "observation feedback for teachers he had never observed".
The report also found that in emails and staff meetings "Mr Pringle gave staff clear encouragement to err on the side of generosity in assessing attainment".
In a statement, Vicky Helliwell the executive head of the school said Mr Pringle had not been in contact with any member of staff or pupils since he was suspended.
"I became aware of issues in the reporting of school data after I took up post as executive head at the school in April 2015," she said.
"I suspended Mr Pringle and reported the issue to the local authority.
"I want to assure parents and carers that there has been no adverse impact on children's education or teaching."
