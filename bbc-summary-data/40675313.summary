Glamorgan and Sussex were finally foiled by the weather when the rain returned after eight overs of the visitors' innings in Cardiff.

Sussex raced to 87-2 in what was scheduled to be a nine-over contest.
Captain Ross Taylor (40 not out off 19 balls) and young North Walian Phil Salt (28 not out) had set up a challenging Sussex total.
Paceman Marchant de Lange claimed the early wickets of Luke Wright and Chris Nash in his first over.
Glamorgan have revealed that batsman David Lloyd will be out for two to four weeks with an arm strain, while Sussex did not field fast bowler Tymal Mills who made his comeback from injury against Hampshire the previous night.
Glamorgan captain Jacques Rudolph told BBC Wales Sport:
"It wasn't ideal, the umpires did a good job getting us onto the field and if you look at the scorecard of just over ten runs an over, we would have backed ourselves to give a good opportunity to win this game.
"A bit hit and miss (with the ball), but Salt played really well. He ran at Marchant who bowls quickly and hit him nicely, so credit to them.
"Overall we've been playing some good cricket and there's a good spirit in our environment, so it would be nice to get in a full game on Sunday (at home to Essex)."
Sussex batsman Phil Salt told BBC Sussex:
"It was a stopping wicket, but they bowled quite well- I got off to a flier but didn't kick on as I would have liked.
"It was quite a big learner for me watching how Ross played his innings, it's important for me to see how top international players play that sort of situation.
"I started playing at St Asaph in North Wales, around seven or eight, but my parents moved to the Caribbean for work and that's where I started playing properly. I'm not your normal English batsman, I like to be exciting and T20's my favourite format."
