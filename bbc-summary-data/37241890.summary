The Australian author died in the coastal town of Byron Bay in New South Wales state surrounded by family.
Oz often covered taboo topics including homosexuality, abortion, police brutality and censorship.
The magazine was caught up in a high-profile obscenity trial in the UK in 1971.
"Our wonderful Richard has gone on to his next adventure," Ms Clarke Neville said in a statement posted on Facebook.
"He died tonight in Bryon Bay surrounded by all of us - Julie, Lucy, Angelica and Ricardo."
