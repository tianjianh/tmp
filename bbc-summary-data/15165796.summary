The 43-year-old collected an honorary Doctorate of Health Sciences from Anglia Ruskin University at a ceremony in Chelmsford.
It has been awarded in recognition of her work promoting breast cancer awareness after battling the disease.
The Australian is one of 12 people to be conferred honorary degrees.
Wearing a traditional doctoral cap and gown, she spoke to about 220 graduates from the faculty of education.
She said: "I never went to university so my dad will be very proud when he sees the pictures.
"I am here partly for the work I do promoting breast cancer awareness.
"When you are diagnosed yourself it becomes a lot more real and you appreciate at first hand the hard work that goes on to support patients through it."
Ms Minogue, who has recorded more than 30 top 10 UK singles over a career lasting more than 20 years, was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2005.
She subsequently underwent surgery and a course of chemotherapy.
Several other names from the world of entertainment, sport and business are being honoured at the university's graduation ceremonies in Chelmsford and Cambridge this week, alongside 2,500 successful university students.
Novelist Jilly Cooper received an honorary Doctorate of Letters for her services to journalism and literature on Tuesday.
Accessories designer Anya Hindmarch will be presented with an honorary Doctor of Arts on Thursday.
Five-time Olympic swimmer Mark Foster, television sports presenter Manish Bhasin and economist Kate Barker have also been honoured.
Professor Michael Thorne, vice chancellor of Anglia Ruskin University, said: "We make honorary awards to individuals of extraordinary talent who have made an outstanding contribution to their chosen field of endeavour.
"We hope that the recipients of these honorary awards will serve as examples to our graduates."
