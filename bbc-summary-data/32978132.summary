[SN]TITLE[SN]
University of Reading SSE department set for closure

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A department looks set to shut down at the University of Reading with degree courses axed and job losses expected.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Systems Engineering building could close owing to low enrolment, an almost Â£2m deficit and "disappointing" academic research results.
Some subjects will be moved to other departments, but degrees including BScs in Robotics and IT will cease in 2016.
Students currently enrolled in the more than ten subjects under threat will have their degrees honoured.
Up to 15 academic and 20 support posts will be lost if the recommendations go ahead, the university said.
Vice-Chancellor Sir David Bell said: "We believe these recommendations are in the best long-term interests of the whole institution.
"We have not made these recommendations at all lightly, but our proposals strike the right balance between building on existing strengths and taking robust action on weaker areas."
The degrees recommended to be axed are:
The existing BSc Computer Science, which accounts for nearly 60% of all SSE undergraduates, and MSc Advanced Computer Science would continue under a new Department of Computer Science, created within the School of Mathematical and Physical Sciences.
New divisions will also be created to retain research expertise in certain subjects.
The university's council will decide on the recommendations, made by a review group, on 13 July.
