Taskin Ahmed: Bangladesh bowler loses illegal action appeal

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Bangladesh pace bowler Taskin Ahmed has lost his appeal after being suspended for an illegal bowling action.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 20-year-old was reported by the umpires after the Tigers' World Twenty20 preliminary match against the Netherlands last week.
He took 2-32 as his side lost their opening Super 10 match to Pakistan, but missed the defeat by Australia.
After a review hearing on Tuesday, the International Cricket Council (ICC) said his suspension had been upheld.
Taskin can apply for a reassessment of his action following appropriate remedial work.
Bangladesh, who are bottom of their group after two straight defeats, face hosts India in their third match on Wednesday.
Taskin was reported along with left-arm spinner Arafat Sunny, 29.
An independent assessment found some of Taskin's standard deliveries exceeded the permissible level of elbow extension.
He has taken nine wickets in 13 Twenty20 appearances for his country and 21 in 14 one-day internationals.
