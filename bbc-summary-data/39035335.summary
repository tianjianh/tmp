[SN]TITLE[SN]
Swindon Town 3-1 Gillingham

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Jon Obika was on target to give Swindon back-to-back victories as they came from behind to win against Gillingham at the County Ground.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The striker scored his second goal in as many games for the club as they try to fight their way out of League One's relegation zone.
Gillingham took an early lead in the 10th minute after a lack of concentration in the Swindon defence allowed Cody McDonald to seize the ball before stroking it past Lawrence Vigouroux.
The home side could have equalised minutes later but for Stuart Nelson's heroics in goal as he produced a fine double save from Ben Gladwin.
Rohan Ince drew the Robins level in the 56th minute when he stabbed the ball in from close range after Gladwin's corner.
Swindon then took the lead five minutes later through Obika as he surged forwards with the ball before unleashing a strike from 18 yards out which found the bottom corner.
Raphael Rossi-Branco sealed the victory for the home side after he headed home past a helpless Nelson from Charlie Colkett's corner.
