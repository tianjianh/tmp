New St Mirren manager Alex Rae believes he is better prepared for the role than when he led Dundee to the runners-up spot in the First Division in 2007.

The 46-year-old has since been in support roles at Milton Keynes Dons, Notts County, Blackpool and Genk.
"I'd have say that, in terms of my overall attributes, I've definitely improved over that period with a bit of experience," Rae told BBC Scotland.
"It is obviously a big challenge and I do enjoy a challenge."
Rae signed an 18-month contract on Friday as St Mirren acted swiftly to replace Ian Murray, who resigned on Saturday with his side third bottom of the Scottish Championship.
"It is a good club, it has good infrastructure in terms of the stadium, training facilities and it's got a lot of young boys who are looking to make their mark in the game," he said.
"I just felt the opportunity was too good to pass up."
Rae believes a squad that has changed little since their relegation from the Premiership has been underperforming this season.
"They have about five or six guys over 30 and then they have the nucleus of 21 and under," he said.
"So if you could maybe add one or two or three in the mid-20s, seasoned pros who can maybe help because it is a wee bit imbalanced at the moment.
"I still think there is plenty of potential there. plenty of life in the boys who are in their 30s, so it is just a case of going in and trying to galvanise them.
"There's enough money to maybe bring one or two in and maybe get one or two out on loan to free up some cash."
Rae was sacked by Dundee when they slipped to eighth place during his third season in charge, but he believes his time at Dens Park proved he could improve a squad.
"We managed to get Dundee up to contenders and the second season we were runners-up, with 69 points, which the previous year would have won promotion," he said.
"When I went into Dundee, we finished seventh the year before we got there, but we had a full pre-season with them and that is not the case here.
"Wee Jack Ross will have Alloa fired up for his first game in charge, so Saturday is a massive game for us."
Rae, who will be in dugout as the Buddies travel to face the side sitting at the foot of the table, is looking forward to his second spell as a manager.
"I've worked in several different positions," he added. "I've done the number two, I've been head of recruitment at MK Dons and I've had a few stints in England and abroad.
"In terms of the preparation and organisation, I'm probably better prepared now in terms of having another eight years under my belt."
