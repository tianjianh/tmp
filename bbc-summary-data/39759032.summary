[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Saffrons led 2-6 to 0-9 at the break with Ciaran Johnston and Conor Johnston netting penalties.
Conor Johnstion was dismissed but the hosts still won easily with Ciaran Clarke adding the third goal.
All is not lost for Down, as they face a qualifier against either Carlow or London.
The hosts were minus local Ruairi Og clubman Neil McManus, due to his wedding on Saturday.
Aided by a stiff wind, Down led 0-4 to 0-1 after seven minutes but Antrim firmly turned things around, particularly following a 12th-minute Ciaran Johnson goal.
Conor Johnson fired Antrim's second three-pointer in the 32nd minute and the Saffrons held a three-point advantage at half-time.
Antrim drove on with some excellent Clarke scores from play and frees.
Down registered back-to-back points to ensure a 2-9 to 0-11 score-line after 55 minutes, but Antrim tagged on 1-6 without reply, including a 66th minute Clarke goal.
There was a trio of home wins in the Nicky Rackard Cup as Derry, Tyrone and Armagh progressed.
Derry were goal hungry in Owenbeg as they overcame Longford by 8-21 to 1-14.
The hosts led by 5-10 to 0-6 at half-time, with Brian Cassidy and Gerald Bradley particularly impressive.
Longford finished with 14 men, following the dismissal of Gerry Moore on a second yellow card.
Tyrone reversed the Division 3A league final result, with an impressive 4-19 to 0-16 win over Donegal in Carrickmore.
The hosts led by 2-15 to 0-4 at half-time, with Conor Grogan netting two second quarter goals.
Damian Casey and Sean Og Grogan added a goal each in the closing 35 minutes.
Armagh held out against a brave Louth side to claim a 0-23 to 2-9 win at the Athletic Grounds.
The sides were tied at 0-9 to 1-6 at half-time, with Gavin Kerrigan netting the visitor's goal.
Michael Ryan scored Louth's second goal early on the restart, but they only managed three further points, to Armagh's 14.
Conor Corvan, David Carvill and Danny Magee were among those to impress for the hosts, as they booked a quarter-final berth.
