HBO has announced the award-winning director will have full input from the Democrat, who left office in January 2001 having served his second term.
Scorsese said in a statement that Clinton "continues to shape the political dialogue" worldwide.
Meanwhile, a film about Clinton's wife Hillary - Rodham - has made The Black List of 2012's best unmade screenplays.
It follows in the footsteps of The King's Speech and Slumdog Millionaire, which both went on to win Oscars for best picture.
The Rodham biopic by Young II Kim is set during the height of the Watergate scandal and features young lawyer Hillary Rodham as she is chosen for the House Judiciary Committee to impeach Nixon.
She has to choose between a destined path to the White House and her unresolved feelings for Clinton, her former boyfriend who teaches law in Arkansas.
Also making the annual list, which is collated from the opinions of  more than 290 Hollywood executives, is Shockingly Evil and Vile by Michael Werwie, about the life of serial killer Ted Bundy.
"I think this is the year of the biopic," said Black List creator Franklin Leonard.
"In general, true stories are well represented this year. If you look at films like (previous Black List script) Argo, if you do them well, there's a market for them."
It is not known when filming for Scorsese's documentary about Clinton will start or when it will be aired.
Scorsese described the former president, 66, as "a towering figure who remains a major voice in world issues.
"Through intimate conversations, I hope to provide greater insight into this transcendent figure."
It marks Scorsese's third documentary at the HBO network, following Public Speaking and George Harrison: Living in the Material World.  He is also the executive producer on crime drama Boardwalk Empire.
Steve Bing, who produced the Rolling Stones' live documentary Shine A Light, has been lined up as co-producer.
Since his time in office, the 42nd president of the US has set up the William J Clinton Foundation, which helps international causes including action against global warming and the prevention of AIDS.
He has remained active in politics, campaigning for Democratic candidates including his wife and Barack Obama.
