Islands council Comhairle nan Eilean Siar could avoid making cuts

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Western Isles Council - Comhairle nan Eilean Siar - may be able to avoid fresh cuts to services when setting its latest budget, its leader has said.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The local authority has a deficit of about Â£7m.
However, leader Angus Campbell said raising council tax and previous rounds of savings should help the comhairle avoid making further cuts.
The full council will meet early next month to set the new budget.
