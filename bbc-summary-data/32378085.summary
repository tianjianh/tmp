[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Fifteen women have contacted police fearing they were targeted by a night-stalker rapist who admitted 11 offences when he appeared in court.

Clive Howard, 56, has been described as a dangerous sexual predator after attacks on six women in Norfolk and Cambridgeshire.
Howard, from Stowmarket, Suffolk, is due to be sentenced later at Norwich Crown Court.
He admitted seven counts of rape, three of kidnap and one of attempted rape.
Fifteen further women have since come forward, and Det Sgt Chris Burgess, from Norfolk Police, confirmed at least one was attacked by Howard.
He said: "He is a very dangerous man - he was a sexual predator. There is concern that there are further victims."
Howard was caught after attacking a woman in her 20s in the St Helens Wharf car park in Norwich on 30 May last year.
He had offered her a lift as she walked home but took her to the car park and raped her.
A partial image of the number plate of his Volvo, deciphered from CCTV, led to him.
His DNA found on the national database linked him to an unsolved case in which a woman was kidnapped in Cambridgeshire in 2013.
A woman in her 20s managed to fight him off and his DNA from a scratch was trapped under her fingernail.
This case opened the door to other attacks with "striking similarities", Mr Burgess said.
Father-of-six Howard, a mechanic, was described as a "loner" whose marriage broke down 15 years ago.
At the time of his arrest, he had an 82-year-old girlfriend.
"He was a quiet man who lived with his parents, frequented dating sites and searched for street workers," Det Sgt Burgess said.
