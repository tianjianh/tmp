[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A service has been held at Lichfield Cathedral to mark the 70th anniversary of VJ Day.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Organised by the Children of Far East Prisoners of War (COFEPOW) group, it included an address by former peace envoy Terry Waite CBE.
It was one of dozens of events taking place across the country.
Paul Watson, chairman of COFEPOW, said it was important to remember those who experienced "immense suffering" in the region during World War Two.
He said many former prisoners of war had died and the period was in danger of being forgotten by the younger generation.
While the war in Europe ended in May 1945, the Japanese did not surrender until 14 August 1945 after the dropping of atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, together killing more than 200,000 people.
Britain suffered more than 90,000 casualties in the war against Japan.
The Queen attended a remembrance service in London, while a minute's silence was held at a ceremony in Tokyo.
