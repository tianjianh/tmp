The first 16 acts will take to the stage for the opening round of live shows this Saturday.
More names are set to be announced for the results show and will include former X Factor contestants as well as established stars.
Saturday will see the contestants perform on the studio stage in a live broadcast and the judges' wildcard acts will be unveiled, with Swift and Williams featured the following night during the first elimination show.
During last weekend's X Factor viewers saw sister duo Blonde Electric change their name to Blonde Electra as they made it through to the final 12.
Along with quartet Only The Young and a yet-to-be-named eight-piece boy band, they will be mentored by Louis Walsh.
Cheryl Fernandez-Versini chose to take through Lauren Platt, Chloe Jasmine and Stephanie Nala - who previously appeared with The Luminites in Britain's Got Talent - for her girls category.
Andrea Faustini, Paul Akister and Jake Quickenden represent the boys category, after being chosen by former Spice Girl Mel B, while Simon Cowell is in charge of Ben Haenow, Fleur East and Jay James in the "overs" category.
At the weekend Strictly Come Dancing producers revealed that Lady Gaga and Tony Bennett are due to appear together in the next few weeks.
This weekend's Strictly results show will see a performance by Donny Osmond, who's sitting in as a guest judge.
The BBC show was slightly ahead of its ITV rival on Sunday night with 8.84 million viewers versus 8.81 million.
