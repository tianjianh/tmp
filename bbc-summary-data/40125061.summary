[SN]TITLE[SN]
Inverness police control room closure could start August

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The closure of the Police Scotland control room in Inverness could be given the go ahead in August.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Police Scotland has been planning the move since last year with the operations in Inverness being transferred to a site in Dundee.
A control room in Aberdeen closed earlier this year and its functions moved to Dundee.
The Scottish Police Authority (SPA) is to be asked to consider the change in Inverness at a meeting in August.
The closure had previously been delayed by Her Majesty's Inspector of Constabulary, who highlighted shortcomings in call handling after police took three days to respond to a fatal crash near Stirling in 2015.
A similar transfer of command and control responsibilities in Aberdeen was completed in early April.
