[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Arbroath moved to within four points of Scottish League Two leaders Forfar Athletic by beating Cowdenbeath at Central Park.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Second-half goals from Josh Skelly and Steven Doris gave the visitors victory over bottom placed Cowden.
Berwick Rangers slipped to second bottom after losing 3-1 to Annan Athletic while Montrose and Stirling Albion drew 2-2.
Leaders Forfar host fourth-placed Clyde on Boxing Day.
It was 0-0 until the 74th minute at Cowdenbeath when Skelly stroked home the opener and Doris made sure of the points three minutes later when he converted a Skelly set piece.
Annan bounced back from two straight defeats with David McKenna's early strike giving them the lead against Berwick, only for Patrick Scullion to reply for the visitors.
However, Peter Watson's header and Rabin Omar's shot - both before half-time - gave Annan the three points.
A first-half own goal from Andrew Steeves gave Stirling the lead at Links Park but headers by Terry Masson and Gary Fraser - the first set up by Steeves - turned the match in Montrose's favour.
However, Ross Smith nodded Albion level and they had Angus Beith sent off deep into stoppage time for foul and abusive language.
Stirling and Berwick are two points above Cowdenbeath.
