It says consultants will be appointed to look at ways to alleviate traffic on the two bridges serving the island.
The issue of a new crossing has been raised several times in the past.
The two existing bridges were built in the first half of the 19th Century but there are congestion issues with modern traffic and freight.
A Welsh government spokesperson said: "We have carried out investigations and consulted with the public over proposals for a new bridge crossing which would relieve congestion across Britannia Bridge.
"Later this year consultants will be appointed to develop these proposals.
"We are also reviewing the current speed limit on the approaches to the bridge in order to help ease congestion at peak times by allowing easier and safer access from the merging slip roads."
Both the Menai Suspension Bridge and Britannia Bridge were built in the first half of the 19th Century but there are congestion issues with modern traffic and freight.
