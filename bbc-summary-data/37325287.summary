[SN]TITLE[SN]
Milton Keynes Dons 0-0 Oxford United

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
MK Dons' winless home league run was extended to nine games after they were held to a goalless draw by Oxford.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Karl Robinson's side have not picked up three points at Stadium MK since a 2-0 win against QPR in March and wasted several good second-half opportunities to see off their opponents.
The hosts started brightly and were the first to go close through Kieran Agard inside six minutes, as the Dons' record signing rounded Oxford keeper Simon Eastwood before seeing his strike on goal superbly cleared off the line by Cheyenne Dunkley.
But the visitors responded with a chance of their own minutes later when Wes Thomas met Liam Sercombe's searching ball from the left inside the six-yard box, only for his close-range shot to be well saved by Dons stopper David Martin.
Dons missed a number of good chances of their own before Martin was called into action at the other end late on - Sercombe finding himself through on goal after some suspect defending but an attempted lob went inches over the crossbar.
