A Welsh MP has urged the home secretary to look again at the case of a Swansea City fan trampled to death in 2000.

Terry Coles, 42, was struck by a police horse after trouble broke out before a league match at Rotherham United.
Swansea East MP Carolyn Harris said without "the truth about all these past injustices, we won't be able to restore trust in South Yorkshire Police".
Home Secretary Amber Rudd responded, saying: "This government has not shirked at historical cases."
Mr Coles was hit by a police horse after trouble between rival groups of fans before the end-of-season Division Three decider in May 2000.
A 2003 inquest ruled his death from abdominal wounds was accidental, after it heard Mr Coles had been drinking and had walked into the path of the horse.
However, a review by the Independent Police Complaints Commission found the actions of three officers amounted to "a failure of duty".
One officer received a verbal warning but no action was taken against the others who had retired.
Mr Coles' wife Christine lost a High Court claim for compensation from the force in 2005.
Ms Harris, who is backing the Coles family's call for "fresh eyes" to look at the evidence, raised the issue of the "tragic case" in the House of Commons on Monday.
The Labour MP referred to "continuing concerns" over the historical conduct of South Yorkshire Police, noting that the home secretary was due to meet those campaigning for a public inquiry into violence at Orgreave during the 1984-1985 miners' strike.
Ms Rudd confirmed that meeting, adding: "This government has not shirked at looking at historical cases and if she wants to bring any other to my attention I will certainly look at them."
In August, South Yorkshire Police said a request to release details of the investigation into Mr Coles' death was being "carefully considered".
