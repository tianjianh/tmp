Ledley, 29, broke his leg on 7 May and has been ruled out of the FA Cup Final, a game he might have started.
"He would have been in the frame for this game, so it is terrible shame to miss him," Pardew confirmed.
Wales manager Chris Coleman said: "Joe will be given until the very last minute before we make a decision."
Coleman added: "I'm optimistic and hopeful, but you never know."
Coleman's assistant manager, Osian Roberts, had previously said Wales could take Ledley to Euro 2016 even if it means the former Cardiff player missing the early part of the competition.
Pardew believes physio Sean Connelly being employed by both the Eagles and the Football Association of Wales gives Ledley an advantage in his recovery.
Wales play Sweden in Stockholm in a friendly on 5 June before facing Slovakia at the Stade Bordeaux on 11 June in their first game of Euro 2016.
"The Wales physio [Connelly] works for us," Pardew explained.
"So when the Welsh team meet up, our physio will go across with Joe and that is perfect, for us, for Joe, for Chris.
"It gives Joe more of a fighting chance, because Sean knows exactly what Joe has done and where he is [in his rehabilitation]."
