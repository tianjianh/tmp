The second edition of the TweedLove event was staged in the region in June this year.
National agency EventScotland has said that it generated significant additional spending in the area.
Festival director Neil Dalgleish said it was a "clear sign" of how important "cycling and bike culture" were to the Scottish Borders.
"I know that we can do even better if we continue to get support from our amazing bike community in the Borders together with businesses and government agencies," he added.
"Mountain biking and road cycling are more or less year-round activities in the Tweed Valley.
"We're very lucky to have such facilities on our doorstep and it's great to see what a contribution they can make."
He said it was important to keep developing trails and road routes throughout the area.
Tweedlove has also announced a sponsorship deal with Alpine Bikes for next year's event which will be extended to 10 days between 26 May and 5 June.
