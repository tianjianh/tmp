A dolphin nicknamed Kenobi appears to have the Jedi skills of her Star Wars namesake.
The young animal, part of a large group of bottlenose dolphins in the Moray Firth, was named after the movie's lightsaber-wielding character Obi-Wan Kenobi.
Kenobi's mother is called Chewbacca and her sibling is known as Yoda, both names of Star Wars characters. They were given to them by scientists at University of Aberdeen's Cromarty Field Station.
Kenobi was photographed on Saturday playing with a long piece of seaweed.
The images were taken by Highlands wildlife tour operator, EcoVentures, Cromarty.
A spokesperson for the Cromarty-based business said: "One of our most favourite dolphins is young Kenobi.
"They certainly do all have their very individual characters and she is one of the most playful, mischievous and inquisitive of them all.
"She found a piece of seaweed which proved to be a huge entertainment for her, and us."
The Moray Firth's dolphins have previously been photographed playing with an unfortunate flounder and a jellyfish.
In the Star Wars films, Jedi master Obi-Wan was famously played in the early films by Sir Alec Guinness and later by Ewan McGregor.
