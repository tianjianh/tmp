The game will take place at the Tissot Arena in Biel on 10 June, kicking off at 17:15 BST.
The last time the sides met was at the 2012 Cyprus Cup, when England won 1-0 thanks to a Fara Williams goal.
The Lionesses play Italy at Port Vale on Friday and Austria at MK Dons' ground on Monday.
Williams said: "Switzerland are an excellent team and it's important we are testing ourselves against the best sides before the tournament.
"We know we are capable of beating the best but also what areas we've got to work on if we want to be successful this summer.
"The games we have lined up before the Euros will allow us to build on this and make sure we're in the best possible position in July."
Mark Sampson's side have been drawn in a group with Scotland, Spain and Portugal at Euro 2017.
Their first match is against Scotland on 19 July.
