Substitute Taylor Miles struck with 13 minutes remaining, cutting in from the right and firing home.
Grimsby striker Nathan Arnold's late free-kick was well saved by Tom King before Richard Tait hit the crossbar with the rebound.
The hosts remain fourth, four points above the visitors, and have won just once in their last five league games.
Meanwhile, the Iron moved level on points with Tranmere, in the last National League play-off place, but have an inferior goal difference with just three games of the season left.

Grimsby Town manager Paul Hurst told BBC Radio Humberside: "Braintree came to frustrate us and they did that.
"We lost the game and it was a bad goal on our part. We were looking to see the ball out in desperation to try to launch an attack ourselves, rather than just dealing with the ball and the lad finished it well.
"We found it difficult to create chances against what we knew beforehand. They're a very organised team that have frustrated a lot of teams this season and we're just the latest."
