A career banker, she joined Whitbread in 2016, becoming one of only a handful of women running FTSE 100 firms.
Whitbread owns Premier Inn, Brewers Fayre and Beefeater Grill restaurants, and the coffee chain Costa.
Receiving the award she follows in the footsteps of Body Shop founder Anita Roddick and former Pearson boss Marjorie Scardino.
The judging panel said Ms Brittain was "a role model for women striving to reach the top of large organisations and working across a range of traditionally male-dominated sectors".
"I have a huge passion for people and a huge passion for... customer-orientated businesses," said Ms Brittain.
"I have a lot of energy, and I love complex problems... and I'm hugely curious about things in the world."
Ms Brittain joined Barclays Bank as a graduate trainee and later became head of retail banking at Lloyds Banking Group.
She was appointed chief executive of Whitbread, which says it is the UK's largest hospitality company, in January 2016.

The Veuve Clicquot Business Woman Award was created in 1972 as a tribute to Madame Clicquot, who in the early 19th Century developed modern champagne-making techniques and established the Veuve Clicquot brand.
The champagne house describes her as having been "proud, stubborn and strong-willed".
As this year's winner, Ms Brittain will visit Veuve Clicquot in France, where she will have a vine named after her.
Veuve Clicquot also gave its first social purpose award to Jude Kelly, the artistic director of London's Southbank Centre.

Ms Bentinck has supported graduates and set up a not-for-profit computer coding course for young women.
