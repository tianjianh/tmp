The 28-year-old helped Steaua to three consecutive domestic league titles and represented the club in both the Champions League and Europa League.
Popa has played 21 times for his country, including at Euro 2016.
"Adrian is an experienced forward with enormous potential," Reading manager Jaap Stam said.
Popa is Reading's second signing of the January transfer window following the arrival of defender Tiago Ilori from Liverpool.
"With the amount of games we have coming up, a player of Adrian's quality will make it easier for us to rotate a little more," Stam added.
"I'm delighted to have him here as part of our squad."
