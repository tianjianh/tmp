Russian plane crash: What Sharm el-Sheikh holidaymakers need to know

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The latest advice for British holidaymakers at - or about to travel to - Egypt's Sharm el-Sheikh resort after the UK suspended air links over security concerns.

The British government halted UK flights to and from Sharm el-Sheikh after intelligence suggested a plane crash in Sinai on Saturday could have been caused by a bomb on board the aircraft.
The UK is working with the Egyptian authorities and air carriers to boost security at the airport so holidaymakers can get home on rescheduled flights, or on an earlier flight if they want.
Airlines have said they expect to start flying people back to the UK on Friday, with British Airways the first to say services will resume then.
But PM David Cameron has warned it will take some time to get everyone home.
Read the latest Foreign Office advice here.
The advice is to try to remain calm as the threat level has not been raised in the resort - only air travel is affected.
You should get in touch with your tour operator, travel agent or airline about travel arrangements.
British Consulate staff are also being sent to the airport and resort to help if you are flying back to the UK very soon.
You may want to call your travel insurer to check they will still provide you with cover while you are there.
But the Association of British Travel Agents (Abta) advises that most insurers will continue to provide cover for holidaymakers who are waiting to get home.
The Foreign Office says security is being increased in the Sharm el-Sheikh and Hurghada resort areas, at the international airports and at check points near towns and many other areas.
Tour operators should meet extra accommodation costs for people on a package holiday.
The Foreign Office is advising against all but essential travel by air to or from Sharm el-Sheikh airport.
Anyone who ignores this advice will invalidate their travel insurance.
If you're not on a package holiday you should contact your travel insurance provider to check you are covered.
Those with holidays booked within the next 48 hours are advised to contact their travel company to discuss their options, says Abta.
"If you have booked a package you will be entitled to a refund or alternative holiday," it said.
But, a word of warning - travellers may have to pay the difference in price if going on an alternative trip.
If you are due to fly to or from Sharm el-Sheik beyond the next 48 hours, you should check with your travel company nearer to the time of your departure to find out what your options are, as there will probably be a review of the current advice.
Different firms are likely to have different policies.
The Irish Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) has also advised its citizens against all non-essential travel to Egypt.
The Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs is advising its citizens against travel to or from Sharm el-Sheikh airport, but says flight suspensions are down to individual airlines
UK officials said they expected other countries to issue similar advice.
Abta says the latest change in advice applies only to air travel to and from Sharm el-Sheikh.
Previous travel restrictions for other areas may still apply, and you should check before travelling.
