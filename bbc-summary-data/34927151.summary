Pienaar, 31, signed a new contract with the Irish province in 2013 after turning down the chance to join European champions Toulon.
"If Ulster thought I was still good enough and wanted to extend my contract I would consider it," said Pienaar.
"I would need to feel I was still playing well and adding value."
Pienaar said he had enjoyed his five years in Belfast and that he and his family were happy in Northern Ireland.
"I do not regret turning down Toulon. Staying with Ulster was a decision I made with my heart," he added.
"I didn't want to break something that was special to me.
"It might have been nice playing with some of the world's best players at Toulon but Ulster was somewhere I felt I really needed to be at this stage of my career."
After last weekend's European Champions Cup defeat by Saracens, Ulster return to Pro12 action away to Leinster on Friday night.
"We have to get over the Saracens game and put on a good performance away in Dublin," said Pienaar who will make his 100th Ulster appearance in the match at the RDS.
"We are still positive because there is a lot to play for."
