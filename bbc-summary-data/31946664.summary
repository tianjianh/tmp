Almost 4,500 motorists have been caught speeding by new cameras along a stretch of the M4 at Port Talbot.

The average 50mph enforcement cameras on the two-mile stretch went live in January with fines of up to £100.
On average, just under 80 people a day were caught in the first two months with figures peaking at weekends.
The cameras are the first to go into operation on a Welsh section of the M4. During a pilot before Christmas around 700 drivers a day were caught.
Chris Hume, from GoSafe, the Wales Road Casualty Reduction Partnership, said the figures were disappointing.
"Excessive and inappropriate speed remains a factor in collisions, associated fatalities, serious injuries and, in this case, also contributes to the traffic congestion around Junctions 40 and 41," he said.
"On average there are still 80 motorists [on a daily basis] showing a complete disregard for the speed limit and putting lives at risk, especially given the degree of media attention this location has received and the work we have undertaken within the community."
Anyone caught within a certain speed will be offered a speed awareness course at a cost of £85 and will not have points on their licence.
The money goes towards the course and road safety funding.
The other option is three points with a £100 fine. Anyone who goes over that limit will not be eligible for the course. The money from that fine goes to the Treasury.
A Welsh government spokesperson said: "We are assessing the effect of the average speed enforcement system on traffic flows as part of the trial part-time closure of junction 41 westbound on-slip, and the results will form part of the report into the trial, which will be published in due course."
