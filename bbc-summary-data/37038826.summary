John Wilson, 63, died in hospital after he was forced to jump from a window in the the terraced house in Curzon Road, Ashton-under-Lyne on Tuesday.
His eldest daughter Leanne Wilson, 25, told the Manchester Evening News he was "an excellent dad and grandad".
His wife and other daughter suffered serious injuries, firefighters said.
Mr Wilson, a double lung transplant survivor, escaped moments before his house exploded, causing it to collapse at both the front and back.
Leanne Wilson, who lives on the same street and heard the explosion, said her father was "a fabulous husband to Mum. He'll be missed by a lot of people."
His wife, Hazel, was caught by a neighbour when she jumped from the bedroom window, and their daughter Danielle, 22, jumped from the roof.
Seven other people, including neighbours who came to the family's aid, suffered minor wounds.
Reverend Karen Hilsden, from Hurst Methodist Church said a vigil will be held at the church on Wednesday evening.
Reading a statement to reporters, she said: "On behalf of the local community, we are all shocked and saddened by yesterday's explosion and the tragic death of John Wilson".
"Our thoughts and prayers are with those who have been affected, particularly the Wilson family and we would appreciate it if you would respect their privacy at this difficult time".
Amy Binmoor, who lives on Hulme Street about 20 yards (18m) from the house, said people "feel numb" but are "pulling together".
Ms Binmoor said she will be attending the vigil to show "people are going to be there for them."
"They are a lovely family and they need people there to know that they care", she said.
Investigators can not yet enter the building to establish the cause of the explosion as it is still unstable, the fire service said.
Firefighters remain at the site removing belongings from neighbouring properties.
