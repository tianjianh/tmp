[SN]TITLE[SN]
Cheltenham Town 1-0 Hartlepool United

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Cheltenham secured their Football League status with a narrow home win over Hartlepool whose own fate will be decided on the final day.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The decisive goal came after 17 minutes when Harry Pell's cross was headed home by Danny Wright from six yards.
Scott Brown touched a header from Lewis Hawkins over the crossbar a minute later as Hartlepool responded well.
A poor backpass from Carl Winchester presented Padraig Amond with a good chance to level, but Brown blocked well to ensure his side led at the break.
Pell nodded a cross into the path of Wright, but he shot wide, and Hartlepool had appeals for a penalty turned down before Amond's cross was cleared at the far post by Liam Davis as Cheltenham were forced to defend.
Brown was called on again to deny substitute Connor Simpson late on as Cheltenham held on.
