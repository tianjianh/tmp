An "amazing" Scottish ski coach has died in an accident in the Alps.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Aaron McLean, a co-founder of off-piste group British Freeride, is thought to have been instructing young skiers in the French mountain resort of Avoriaz when he died on Thursday afternoon.
Mr McLean, 26, went to school in Edinburgh and learned to ski at Hillend.
Snowsport Scotland said he was "a man of great enthusiasm and infectious energy".
"He was immensely instrumental in the formation of British Freeride last year - the organisation that has created our Junior Freeride Coaching Pathway," a spokesman for the organisation said.
"Our thoughts and sympathies go out to his family and close friends and we hope his legacy will live on through the continued activity of British Freeride."
Mr McLean and a group of friends explored Scotland's summits in the short film Late, released last year, and he competed on the Freeride World Tour as Aaron McLean-Foreman.
Colleagues at British Freeride described him as an "amazing skier and lover of the mountains and people".
