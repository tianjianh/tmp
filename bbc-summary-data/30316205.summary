Krzysztof Druzgala, 21, had earlier admitted raping the woman at Swanfield Industrial Estate on 30 August 2014.
The court heard how the victim was attacked as she made her way to work in Leith.
Druzgala pinned her to the ground and punched her. He said later he was drunk and could not remember the attack.
A judge at the High Court in Edinburgh told Druzgala, through an interpreter: "The violence you inflicted in order to overpower her and have sex with her was both extreme in nature and prolonged.
"The girl was frightened for her life and attempted to co-operate with your demands in order to save herself.
"As a result she was badly injured and has been profoundly affected by the trauma you inflicted upon her, both physically and mentally."
The judge said the rape on a 20-year-old stranger in a public place was achieved through violence and threats.
Lord Burns said he would have jailed him for 10 years for the offence, but for his early guilty plea. He also ordered that he be kept under supervision for a further three years.
Lord Burns said the sex attacker's supervision may be a matter for the Polish authorities and pointed out he would be the subject of automatic deportation provisions.
He told Druzgala: "You will remain on the sexual offenders' register for life.
Druzgala was shown CCTV footage from the bus and identified himself. He said: "I don't remember if I met a girl. I was drunk and might not remember."
Druzgala was arrested in Constitution Street in Edinburgh after the attack.
His DNA was found on the fingernails and clothing of the victim.
Defence solicitor advocate Robbie Burnett said: "He deeply regrets his actions, but he has not got the slightest recollection of the incident."
Det Ch Insp Alwyn Bell, of Police Scotland, said: "This was a horrific ordeal for the young woman to endure and a thorough investigation was undertaken to identify the perpetrator.
"As a result of extensive CCTV enquiry Druzgala was identified and brought to justice for this crime.
"I would like to pay tribute to his victim at this time for her courage and continued assistance during our investigation."
