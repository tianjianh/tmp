The game in 2020 would help celebrate the 400th anniversary of the Mayflower's voyage from the city.
The Pilgrim Fathers were aboard the boat and are seen as the founders of the modern day United States.
"We've been in discussions about a series of international matches to recognise 2020," Argyle chairman James Brent told BBC Radio Devon.
"We've been talking to the FA for two years now, they have a certain calendar when they can commit to game, but we are hopeful that we can get an international or two and we are also looking at establishing a tournament."
Plymouth attracts thousands of tourists from the United States every year who come to see the Mayflower steps in the city's Sutton Harbour.
"It's so important to Plymouth and South West, the founding of modern America, the basis of the US constitution is based on the documents that were brought on that boat, the basis of the UN constitution was based on that, so it's massive opportunity," added Brent.
"We are very keen as a football club and as part of the sporting community within Plymouth that in terms of the sports offer in 2020 that we recognise that special relationship with the US."
