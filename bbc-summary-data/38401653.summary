The Uppal family home in Wolverhampton was damaged after a suspected gas explosion destroyed the property next door on 28 December last year.
The blast totally destroyed Wendy Ayoub's home. She was rescued from the site and treated for cuts and a broken ankle.
Neighbour Daljit Uppal said his family hoped to return by February.
Mr Uppal said the explosion "took the side of my house out".
"We had to have one side demolished and it was rebuilt."
"It's frustrating, I would have liked to have been back in the house for Christmas, unfortunately it has taken a lot longer than what we anticipated," added Mr Uppal.
Following the explosion, emergency services said Mrs Ayoub, who was trapped for about two hours, appeared "to have been saved by her washing machine holding back additional rubble and timbers".
She hopes to move back and plans have been submitted for a new two-storey property at the site.
Mr Uppal said his extension had now been completed and the inside of the home was being furnished.
The cause of the blast remains unknown.
National Grid investigated and found none of its pipes or meters were at fault.
