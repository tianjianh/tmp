Six Nations 2017: Sam Warburton should not be Lions captain - Martyn Williams

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
British and Irish Lions coach Warren Gatland should not make Sam Warburton captain for the tour of New Zealand, says ex-Wales flanker Martyn Williams.

Rival captains Dylan Hartley of England, Ireland's Rory Best and Wales' Alun Wyn Jones have been backed for the role, but have also been criticised during the Six Nations.
Warburton, replaced by Jones as Wales captain in January, led Gatland's Lions for the 2013 success in Australia - but Williams said he is "at his best when he can just go out and create havoc".
Speaking to Scrum V, Williams added: "Alun Wyn, for me, is still the man. I think he will have learnt a lot from this Six Nations to make him an even better Lions captain and I'd leave Sam to just do what he's been doing for the last four games.
"I wouldn't give him the captaincy.
"I think Sam spoke just before the tournament and said it had affected him of late, the extra stuff [that goes with the job]."

Warburton, 28, succeeded Williams as long-term open-side for Cardiff Blues and Wales. He first captained his country in 2011 and became the youngest player to lead them at a World Cup that year and also starred at the tournament in 2015.
However, his form had dipped and he moved from the Wales seven jersey to blind-side flanker, with Justin Tipuric taking over at open-side this season.
The back-row duo have earned plaudits for their displays during a roller-coaster Six Nations campaign in which Wales have beaten Italy, then lost to England and Scotland, before redeeming themselves with victory over Ireland on Friday.
Williams' fellow former Wales captain, ex-fly-half Jonathan Davies believes Six Nations champions England are set to dominate Gatland's Lions selection - with Wales, Ireland and Scotland's players filling the gaps.
"Look at the England team and say how many of those players are not going, and then fill the spots," Davies said.
"I think that's the way it's going to go because they are playing so well.
"That's why the game [against Ireland] was big for the Welsh players, and now next week it's a massive game for the Irish to pit themselves against the English for the Lions squad."
