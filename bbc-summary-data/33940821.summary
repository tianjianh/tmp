Retailers call for action as shopper numbers fall

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Retailers have called for action from "government at all levels" to stem a drop in shoppers and a rise in the number of vacant shops in Scotland.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Research by the Scottish Retail Consortium (SRC) found 10.6% of shops were vacant last month - up from 10.4% in June.
That means almost one in every nine retail premises is now sitting empty.
Footfall numbers were unchanged from June's rate, but were 2.4% lower than a year ago.
SRC said encouraging shoppers back was "crucial" to reducing the number of vacant premises.
The SRC/Springboard report for July found the decline in footfall was in high streets and shopping centres, and was much more severe than across the UK as a whole.
However, retail parks saw an 8.8% increase in shopper numbers.
SRC director David Lonsdale, said: "This is a rather cheerless set of figures, heralding a third successive spike in the shop vacancy rate in our town centres coupled with a further drop in shopper footfall.
"A more concerted effort is required to drive up footfall and reduce the number of empty retail premises in our town centres.
"Retailers have a role to play but we also need to see government at all levels consider what further steps could be taken.
"For example, local councils should place more emphasis on accessible and affordable parking and a building standards system that better facilitates retail refurbishment and expansion.
"At a time when retailers' margins are thin or non-existent, government needs to get a firmer grip on tax and regulatory costs which have mushroomed, starting by making it less costly for firms to invest in commercial premises."
