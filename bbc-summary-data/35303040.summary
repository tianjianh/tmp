The 22-year-old's brother, Wigan and England centre Liam, 25, also spent time on loan at Widnes in 2010.
Farrell has also had loan spells at Workington and South Wales Scorpions.
"He's still young, he's got a great desire to be successful and he's very solid defensively," said Vikings head coach Denis Betts.
"He's got some good characteristics and he's always performed well against us.
"He knows a couple of our players already and he's ready to step up and push the likes of Setaimata Sa, Chris Houston, Chris Dean and Matt Whitley in the back-row."
Farrell is also younger cousin of former Andy Farrell who will take up a position as Ireland's defensive coach after the Six Nations following his dismissal by England.
"Liam always had good things to say about Widnes and I've spoke to Dom Crosby, Logan Tomkins and Willie Isa - and they all said it's a great club," he said.
"I'm 22 now and I need to get more game time in Super League."
