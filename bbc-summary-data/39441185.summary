[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Brexit Secretary David Davis has written to the Stormont parties to give details of the government's Brexit priorities for Northern Ireland.

The letter expands on the prime minister's suggestion that more powers could be passed to the devolved administrations.
It says the process of further devolution must be a "considered one" involving "intensive discussions".
It cautions there will be areas "where common frameworks may be required".
Northern Ireland voted to remain in the EU Referendum by a majority of 56% to 44%.
The letter says common frameworks will be necessary to protect the freedom of businesses to operate across the UK single market and to enable the UK to strike free trade deals.
It adds that the need for common frameworks will also depend on the nature of any agreement with the EU.
That suggests that, for some areas, further devolution will not necessarily mean much regulatory divergence from a UK norm.
The letter also says that in considering the replacement of EU funding the government is "aware of the importance attached to those programmes which have had unique resonance in Northern Ireland".
It cites the Peace and Interreg funds saying they have had a role in "enhancing community cohesion across Northern Ireland and in border regions".
The letter also restates the UK government's commitment to the maintaining the Common Travel Area and having an Irish border which is as "seamless and frictionless as possible".
Prime Minister Theresa May triggered Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty on Wednesday, starting a two-year countdown to the UK's exit from the EU.
She said there would be "no return to the borders of the past" and said the Conservative Party has a "preference that Northern Ireland should remain part of the UK".
Mrs May's Article 50 letter says the government wants to avoid a return to a hard border between the UK and the Republic of Ireland, to be able to maintain the Common Travel Area and to make sure that the UK's withdrawal from the EU does not harm the Republic of Ireland.
