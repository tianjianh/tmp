[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A prolific paedophile has been jailed for life with a minimum tariff of 16 years for 45 sex offences against young boys in England and Thailand.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Retired English teacher Mark Frost, 70, had admitted abusing nine children in Thailand between 2009 and 2012.
He had pleaded guilty to all of the charges, including six relating to abuse of two pupils at a Worcestershire school during the 1980s and 1990s.
Judge Mark Lucraft called the abuse "horrific and deeply disturbing".
Previously known as Andrew Tracey, Frost was brought to justice following an international investigation involving the UK's National Crime Agency (NCA), and authorities in Thailand, Spain and the Netherlands.
The charges included multiple rapes, sex assaults, inciting children to engage in sexual activity and making indecent pictures.
Judge Lucraft handed Frost 13 life sentences, to run concurrently, during the hearing at the Old Bailey.
He said Frost was responsible for "the most appalling catalogue of sexual abuse" and it was clear he had an "ongoing obsession" with young boys.
"Your conduct towards each and every one of these victims is horrific and deeply disturbing," the judge said.
Frost raped impoverished Asian boys and encouraged them to engage in sex acts after he groomed them with money, sweets, computer games and swims in his pool.
He skipped bail to avoid prosecution in Thailand but was extradited from Spain last year after his activities were uncovered by Dutch police on the computer of a man in the Netherlands.
Frost had got the boys, aged between 10 and 14, to give thumbs-up signs and make heart gestures with their hands while being filmed on a webcam engaging in sexual acts.
The court also previously heard details of Frost's abuse of two pupils at a school in Worcestershire during the late 1980s and 1990s.
He had sex with the boys in a school storeroom, during breaks, at his home where he lived with his adopted son, and also at a car park in Woking, Surrey, the Old Bailey heard.
