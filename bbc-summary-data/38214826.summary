Half of the stand at Radcliffe Borough was destroyed, including the press room and PA box, in Sunday evening's blaze.
Club chairman Paul Hilton has appealed to the local community to attend the Lancashire Cup game against West Didsbury and Chorlton later.
Greater Manchester Fire Service said the cause of the fire is not yet known.
Mr Hilton said the club, which is in the first division of the Northern Premier League, had been "overwhelmed" by messages of support, offers of help and even financial donations.
He added: "It's a massive blow but we're hoping the community rallies round the club and helps us out.
"It would mean the world to us if our fans, the local community, which we work so passionately to support, and supporters of any football team come and watch a game of football."
