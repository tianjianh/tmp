Exeter City boss Paul Tisdale says he would be "amazed" if fans stopped coming to home matches, despite a poor start to the League Two season.

The Devon side are yet to pick up a point at St James Park, winning only two of their last 19 home league games.
"I'd be surprised if they didn't come back - the team's put all their effort in. They're trying really hard," Tisdale told BBC Radio Devon.
"It's a results business but also it needs a bit of common sense."
Exeter are the only English Football League team to lose three home games this season, and their next match at St James Park sees them face rivals Plymouth Argyle.
Tisdale's squad has been hit by injuries to eight first-team players in recent weeks.
"I'll be amazed if they (the supporters) don't come back," he added.
"Anybody with any sense would look at our team and think 'crikey they're low on the ground for players'."
