[SN]TITLE[SN]
Libor trial hears of multi-million currency fix - for a curry

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A convicted currency trader offered six London brokers take-away curries in exchange for helping him fix multi-million pound yen currency trades, a court has heard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The six are accused of helping Tom Hayes and others fix Libor rates.
Hayes was found guilty of conspiracy to defraud earlier this year and sentenced to 14 years in prison.
Southwark Crown Court heard he asked the brokers repeatedly for help via instant messages and emails.
The jury was shown the messages and emails, and played recorded phone calls in which the prosecution claim the men explicitly discuss illegally helping him.
They included messages sent using Bloomberg Chat (BC) service between some of the men and Hayes in 2006, when he was working for UBS in Tokyo, in which he offered to pay for curries if they helped him with multi-million pound yen currency trades by manipulating the Libor rate.
Libor is the term for the benchmark interest rate which underpins hundreds of trillions of pounds of contracts, from mortgages to corporate lending.
The six men - Noel Cryan, 49, of Chislehurst, Kent, Darrell Read, 50, of Wellington, New Zealand, Danny Wilkinson, 48, of Hornchurch, Essex, Colin Goodman, 53, of Epsom, Surrey, James Gilmour, 50 of Benfleet, Essex and Terry Farr, 44, of Southend-on-Sea in Essex - are accused of conspiracy to defraud.
The men worked at different firms: Mr Cryan worked for Tullett Prebon. Mr Read, Mr Wilkinson and Mr Goodman worked for ICAP while Mr Gilmour and Mr Farr worked for RP Martin.
In one BC message in October 2006, Mr Read told Hayes he could help him with a Libor rate, adding: "Got to buy the cash boys a curry this week."
Hayes replied: "I should pay it for them."
Mr Read then said he would put it on his expenses. In another message series discussing a trade a few days later, Mr Read said to Hayes: "A Â£50 curry was cheap then?"
Hayes replied: "Yes mate. Whatever it takes, bill me."
In an email around the same time, during his first weeks working in Tokyo, the court heard Hayes wrote: "Should be good news today, Libor went up half a base point. Well done Darrell and Terry (Farr). I owe them a beer."
The jury has previously been told Goodman's nickname was Lord Libor.
In an October 2006 email exchange with Mr Read over setting Libor rates, Mr Goodman told him: "K10 (a Japanese restaurant) for lunch or cash would be preferable. Out for curry tonight."
He signed the email "MLord", the court heard. Mr Read replied: "K10 it is."
Prosecutor Mukul Chawla QC told the jury: "It is small things like beers or a curry. The process is not so trivial."
The six defendants all deny the charges against them and the trial continues.
