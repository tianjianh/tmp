Stuart Broad wants to play for England at 2019 World Cup

Fast bowler Stuart Broad says he wants to earn a regular place in England's one-day side in order to play at a home World Cup in 2019.

Broad, 29, has played only two ODIs since the 2015 World Cup and was left out of the squad for the World T20.
"I've got a lot of hunger and desire to get back in that team consistently," he told the BBC's Stumped.
"A huge target is 2019. I've got a lot of experience, played 121 ODIs and I've got a pretty good record."

Nottinghamshire bowler Broad was left out of the one-day squad for almost a year after England were knocked out of the World Cup in the first round.
While that was partly to look at new faces, it was also to manage his workload - Broad had knee surgery in 2014.
However, he was recalled for the one-day series in South Africa, playing the final two games of a series that England lost 3-2.
"I've played all three formats for eight or nine years and coped quite well with that," said Broad, who is set to miss a World T20 tournament for the first time after captaining England in 2012 and 2014.
Speaking in his role as an ambassador for The Belfry Golf Club, he added: "Part and parcel of being an international cricketer is staying fit and fresh for as much cricket as possible.
"We know it's a short career, so you have to try and be in the best possible shape."
After defeating South Africa 2-1 in the Test series, England can claim to have won their most recent series against seven of the nine other Test-playing sides.
The two trophies outstanding are for the contests with Sri Lanka and Pakistan, who both visit England this summer.
"With those two coming over this summer, we have a huge driving point," said Broad, who is third on the all-time list of England Test wicket-takers with 333.
"It's great to have, because it keeps you continually trying to improve."
Broad's tally of 56 Test wickets in 2015 was bettered only by India spinner Ravichandran Ashwin, while his 6-15 in the third Test win over South Africa took him above Ashwin and Proteas pace bowler Dale Steyn to the top of the world bowling rankings.
Broad is the first England bowler since 2004 to top the list, while before that Sir Ian Botham led the way in 1980.
"I'm hugely proud to be number one, it shows that you take important wickets," said Broad. "To follow Beefy (Botham) and Harmy as the only other two to have been ranked number one for England, it brings it home how special that is.
"I'm not overnight going to think I'm a better bowler than Dale Steyn, I've just been fortunate that I've stayed on the park recently and taken some consistent wickets.
"Hopefully I can be there for a period of time. I'm not going to be one of those bowlers who just stays there for five weeks. It gives me huge hunger and a huge desire to improve."
