Mr Parker, who also presented BBC regional news programme South Today for 35 years, has been recognised for his charity and community work in Hampshire and on the Channel Islands.
He is chairman of the Friends of Winchester Cathedral, and a trustee.
He also chairs the educational charities Elizabeth College Foundation and Gibson Fleming Trust in Guernsey.
Mr Parker, from Andover, said he was "absolutely over the moon and thrilled to bits" by the appointment.
"It came quite out of the blue and I am very proud," he added.
"I am accepting it on behalf of, and sharing it with, all of the dedicated people I work with in charity."
Mr Parker is also vice-patron of both the Hampshire and Isle of Wight's Air Ambulance and Smile Support and Care charities, and an ambassador for Leukaemia Busters in Southampton.
He is also a former chairman of Winchester's Harestock School governors and Appleshaw Parish Council.
In the 1960s Mr Parker led a local radio pilot for schools on the Channel Islands which later contributed to the establishment of the BBC's local radio network in the UK.
Brought up in Guernsey, he was the first host of the BBC's Antiques Roadshow, which celebrates its 40th anniversary next year.
The 75-year-old was also a presenter of Nationwide, hosted BBC One's 1970s music and arts series Mainstream, and presented and produced BBC Radio 4 programmes.
He achieved worldwide prominence when he led the BBC's coverage of the raising of the Mary Rose at Portsmouth in 1982.
He was subsequently in charge of BBC South's political programming.
He has also won several Royal Television Society awards and is the author of a number of books.
