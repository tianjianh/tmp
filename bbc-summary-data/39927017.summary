[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Dr Julie McAdam was giving was giving evidence at the trial of Steven Kirkwood at the High Court in Glasgow.
Mr Kirkwood is accused murdering Mr O'Hanlon, 45, at HK Autotek, Stevenston, Ayrshire, on 25 July.
He denies the charge and attempting to defeat the ends of justice by disposing of a knife.
The 44 year old has also lodged a special defence of self-defence.
The jury was told that Mr O'Hanlon was 6ft and weighed 17st 3lbs.
Dr McAdam said: "He had a bodybuilder's physique."
She told prosecutor Richard Goddard that the fatal wound to Mr O'Hanlon's abdomen cut two major blood vessels to the legs.
She said the injuries could have been caused by one knife, but she could not rule that more than one knife had been used.
Police casualty surgeon Dr Gary Walker told the jury that Mr Kirkwood had a number of bruises and scratches on him when he examined him on 25 July.
Mr Goddard said: "These are non-specific and general injuries with no medical intervention required," and Dr Walker said: "Yes."
The GP confirmed that there were no injuries to the palms of his hands.
The court was told that Mr Kirkwood claims that Mr O'Hanlon struck him with a pick axe handle during a struggle.
Mr Fairlie told the court: "Our findings do not assist in addressing whether Michael O'Hanlon struck Steven Kirkland with the pick axe handle, or not."
The court had earlier heard that Mr Kirkwood and Mr O'Hanlon had exchanged abusive texts in the days prior to his death.
Mr O'Hanlon and his friend Forbes Cowan had gone to the garage to meet Mr Kirkwood.
Earlier, witnesses told of a struggle between Mr O'Hanlon and Mr Kirkwood.
The trial before judge Lady Rae continues.
