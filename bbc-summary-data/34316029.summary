A new speed camera system has gone live on a stretch of the A15 south of Lincoln where a number of serious crashes have occurred in recent years.

The cameras will measure drivers' average speed along a 4km (2.4m) section of the road.
The Lincolnshire Road Safety Partnership said the measures would reduce the risk for drivers emerging from junctions.
Cameras have been installed between junctions for Metheringham and Navenby.
The road safety partnership said seven people had been seriously injured in crashes in the past five years, with the speed of vehicles past junctions cited as one of the main causes.
John Siddle, spokesman for the road safety partnership, said: "This is one of our major roads through the county, carrying a lot of traffic, and it's also one of our high casualty routes.
"Previously, anyone emerging from junctions would do so with extreme risk trying to gauge the speed of approaching vehicles."
"Now the cameras have been installed, traffic pulling out on to the road can do so quite easily," he added.
No reduction has been made to the 60mph national speed limit in force along the route.
