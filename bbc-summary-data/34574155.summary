The Spaniard, 44, has been linked with Manchester City, and walked out of a news conference after being asked about the England job in September.
"It is clear that there are other good-looking brides out there," Bayern chief executive Karl-Heinz Rummenigge said.
"But we are optimistic that Pep Guardiola will stay at Bayern."
Speaking before Bayern's Champions League meeting with Arsenal at the Emirates Stadium on Tuesday, Rummenigge added: "I have said that in the second half of 2015 there will be a discussion and then there will be clarity.
"That talk is still pending but it will still take place sometime before the end of the year."
Former Barcelona boss Guardiola has led German club Bayern to two Bundesliga titles since taking over in 2013, yet he questioned at the start of this season whether he was the right man for the job.
He said he would step down if he ever got the feeling somebody else would be a better choice, leading to speculation that he will leave next summer.
