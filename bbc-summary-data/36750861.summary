Jane Bell pool death: Dalmeny Hotel owners face trial

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The owners of hotel where a three-year-old girl drowned in a swimming pool are to face trial over alleged health and safety failures.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Jane Bell got into difficulty at the Dalmeny Hotel in St Annes, Lancashire, in August 2014.
The hotel's owners have been charged with failing in their duty to ensure the safety of guests and failing to make a risk assessment.
They will face trial at Preston Crown Court in August.
No plea was entered during a brief hearing before magistrates in Preston on Saturday.
The child, from Galashiels in the Scottish Borders, had been on holiday with her parents and six-year-old sister.
She was swimming in the hotel's main pool when she got into difficulty in the 7ft (2m) deep end.
