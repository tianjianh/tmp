Rare WW2 ceasefire order sells for £1,000 in Nottingham

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A rare document ordering Allied forces to cease fire following the surrender of Nazi Germany has sold for £1,000.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The order was issued by Field Marshal Bernard Law Montgomery after he witnessed the surrender of Nazi forces in northern Europe on 4 May.
The mimeographed document is one of the earliest written records of the German surrender.
The words in purple ink on it read: "All offensive ops will cease fire from receipt this signal."
It adds: "Orders will be given to all troops to cease fire 0800 hrs tomorrow Saturday 5 May."
Richard Davie, of auctioneers  Nottingham's International Autograph Auctions, said the note was an "historically important document".
German forces in Italy had already surrendered on 2 May, but those in north-west Germany, Denmark and Holland surrendered to Field Marshal Montgomery, who was commanding all the British and Canadian armies in Europe, inside a tent at his headquarters, at Luneburg Heath on 4 May 1945.
The final document of unconditional surrender was signed at US General Dwight Eisenhower's headquarters in Reims on 7 May.
An official statement declaring the war in Europe over was made the following day.
