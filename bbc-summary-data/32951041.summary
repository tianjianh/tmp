[SN]TITLE[SN]
Chalgrove St Mary's Church art restoration under way

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A £1m project to restore and preserve a unique set of medieval wall paintings in an Oxfordshire church is under way.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The art, which covers three walls of the 12th Century St Mary's Church in Chalgrove, is believed to have been created in about 1320.
The building is out of action until February, and all the furniture and fittings have been removed.
The project to restore the paintings has been awarded £544,000 from the Heritage Lottery Fund.
The church has now managed to raise all but £56,000 of the funds it needs and is continuing to seek donations.
Vicar, the Reverend Ian Cohen, said the church would be "in exile" while the work was carried out.
The images, which depict the life, death and resurrection of Jesus, the death and assumption of Mary and the day of judgement, are believed to have been paid for by local nobles.
They were lime washed at the time of the Reformation, but rediscovered during renovations in 1858.
