RMT to decide on future rail strikes after rejecting FGW offer

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A union representing rail workers has said it will decide on future strike dates after rejecting the latest offer by First Great Western (FGW).

High-speed services between London, the West of England and Wales were hit last week when about 2,000 Rail, Maritime and Transport (RMT) members walked out.
The dispute is over concerns guards and buffet cars will be disposed of on new Hitachi Inter City Express trains.
The RMT said "core issues remain unresolved" in FGW's revised offer.
The new trains are set to run on the Great Western main line from 2017.
FGW said it had "made very clear" its "commitments on job security and the customer experience".
But one of the sticking points is that FGW wants drivers to have control over doors, instead of the guards who are currently in charge of this role.
The RMT said this was "a clear dilution of the important safety role of the guard and contrary to RMT policy".
The union said a "lack of assurance" on protecting engineering jobs and keeping the buffet car facilities were also issues.
RMT General Secretary Mick Cash said: "Despite the media spin played out by the company yesterday the reality of the offer now received by the union falls well short of what is required in the key areas of jobs, services and safety for us to reach an agreement.
"As a result we will now be meeting with our sister unions to discuss the campaign strategy and RMT's executive will be deciding on future strike dates next week."
The new trains are being introduced under the Intercity Express Programme on routes between London Paddington and Oxford, Bristol and South Wales.
