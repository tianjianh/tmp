A faith-based comedy about the true meaning of Christmas was the big winner at the annual Razzie Awards.

Kirk Cameron's Saving Christmas won four awards, including worst picture and worst actor, at Saturday night's 35th Golden Raspberry Awards ceremony.
The tongue-in-cheek show, which celebrates movie-making mediocrity, took place a short walk from the venue for Sunday's Academy Awards.
Razzie winners, who rarely turn up, get a $4.79 gold-spray-painted trophy.
Saving Christmas won worst picture, worst actor, worst screenplay and worst screen combo - for former Growing Pains star Kirk Cameron "and his ego".
"This is a vanity project that Kirk Cameron put together," Razzie founder John Wilson told BBC Radio 5 live after the ceremony.
"It's about on the level of a super 8 movie from when I was a kid. It has no cinematic value at all."
He pointed out that the film was rated number one worst movie of all time on international movie database IMDB.com
Saving Christmas is also only one of two films last year to score a zero rating on the review aggregation site Rotten Tomatoes.
The tag line on its film poster is "Put Christ back in Christmas".
Cameron Diaz was named worst actress for two comedies The Other Woman and Sex Tape.
The worst supporting actress prize went to Megan Fox for the reboot of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.
Michael Bay's Transformers: Age of Extinction had led the field with seven nominations, but won only worst director and worst supporting actor for Kelsey Grammer.
Annie was named the worst remake, rip-off or sequel.
A new category - the Razzie Redeemer award - was introduced this year to reward a former  Razzies target who has done good work in the past 12 months.
Ben Affleck was saluted in an online public vote for going from the much-panned Gigli to Oscar-winning Argo and Oscar-nominated Gone Girl.
His award was announced by real-life nun and veteran film critic Sister Rose Pacatte.
She told the audience: "We Catholic nuns are all about redemption."
The regular awards are chosen by 757 voting members in the US and abroad.
For the first time, the paying public were able to attend the irreverent ceremony - held this year at Hollywood's Montalban theatre.
