Livingston manager David Hopkin urged his players to keep faith in the club's survival fight after defeating Falkirk.

The 2-1 victory means a win over Alloa Athletic next weekend would consign their opponents to relegation, leaving Livingston and Dumbarton battling to avoid the play-off spot.
"There's real belief and team spirit," Hopkin told BBC Scotland.
"We need to make sure we keep that going until the end of the season."
Hopkin's side has won three of their last five games but remain second-bottom, two points behind Dumbarton.
The win over Falkirk - the Bairns' first home league defeat in five months - was based on a very well-organised defensive display that denied the home side's attackers the space and time to operate.
Livingston scored twice in the game's final 15 minutes through Jordan White and Sam Stanton, before Will Vaulks pulled a late goal back, and in a thrilling finale, Marc McCallum saved John Baird's penalty with virtually the last kick to deny Falkirk a point.
"We had a game plan and it worked really well, but at 2-0 up we switched off," said Hopkin.
"We've got fantastic energy in the team. We've got a young team, and we're trying to build something here.
"It's about us getting in on the Monday and starting to prepare for the Alloa game. We've not done anything yet, hopefully we can just keep going and keep everybody fit."
Falkirk boss Houston was "frustrated" with the display of his team, particularly since their previous game had seen them recover from falling 2-0 behind to Championship leaders Rangers to win 3-2.
Falkirk remain in second place, albeit Hibernian are six points behind them with three games in hand, and Houston wants his players to learn from this defeat.
"Livingston came and did a job on us, and you've got to give them credit for that," he said.
"Our tempo was really low and poor, we wanted to play the perfect pass and get in behind, but they flooded the area. The quality wasn't good enough.
"It's a lesson for us that if we want to get second place we can't go about games in the tempo we did in the first half. It was too lethargic."
