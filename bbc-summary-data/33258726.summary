Peter Rippington, 59, who taught at Alvechurch School in Worcestershire, died in the crash in February 2012.
The company, Interski, had previously denied responsibility, saying the driver of the bus had not been at fault.
However, Derek Thompson was found guilty of manslaughter in March.
The 50-year-old, of Atherstone, Warwickshire, was given a six-month suspended sentence in March by a court in Chalons-en-Champagne, north-east France.
An Interski spokesperson confirmed the firm had admitted liability.
Many of those passengers injured in the crash are now planning to sue.
Cheryl Palmer-Hughes, of Irwin Mitchell, said: "Many of our clients have been left with serious and life-changing injuries as a result of the coach crash back in 2012.
"We can now focus on continuing to ensure that the victims get the compensation and support they need and deserve to help them overcome their injuries."
The firm said the passengers would seek "six-figure sums".
