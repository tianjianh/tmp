[SN]TITLE[SN]
Chesterfield 0-1 Oldham Athletic

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A late header from skipper Peter Clarke gave 10-man Oldham a vital victory at League One relegation rivals Chesterfield.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Oldham played the second half a man down after defender Anthony Gerrard was dismissed for an incident in the tunnel but they defended superbly and Clarke clinched the points with a far-post header in injury time.
Oldham went close after only 15 seconds when Ryan McLaughlin fired just wide from 20 yards and the visitors got into some promising positions before Chesterfield had the best chance in the 29th minute.
New signing from Manchester United, Sadiq El Fitouri. whipped a low cross in from the right which evaded three Oldham defenders but Dan Jones mis-kicked at the back post.
Chesterfield were given an advantage at the end of the first half when Gerrard, who had already been booked, was shown a second yellow card as the players were going down the tunnel.
That forced Oldham to get men behind the ball and Chesterfield struggled to break them down despite the extra man, and the visitors almost snatched a goal on the break when Aaron Amadi Holloway nearly went clear.
But Oldham stunned Chesterfield in the first minute of stoppage time when Clarke capped a superb display with a header inside Ryan Fulton's left post.
