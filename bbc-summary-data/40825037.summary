The result also guarantees that a British player will feature on Sunday's Super Series singles finals day.
There are six Super Series events throughout the year, of which the British Open is one.
They attract some of the best players in the world and are the level just below the Grand Slams.
Reid came through a tough three-set match against France's Nicolas Peifer, winning 7-5 1-6 6-2.
He said: "It wasn't the prettiest match ever and the conditions were even more difficult than in the quarter-finals but it was good to get through it and I played some good tennis towards the end."
Hewett, meanwhile, came from 5-2 and two set points down at 5-4 in the second set to defeat Belgium's Joachim Gerard 7-6 (7-4) 7-6 (7-3).
He said: "It was a really good match in really difficult conditions today with the rain.
"I don't really know at the moment why or how I was 5-2 down but I was happy to come back from it.
"It's great for everyone here that there's going to be a Brit in the men's singles final and I'm focusing on what I need to do to make sure it's me there."
They are not the only British players to be getting a taste of success at this year's tournament.
Andy Lapthorne and compatriot Antony Cotterill beat Heath Davidson and Lucas Sithole in straight sets and tough conditions 6-4 6-2 in their doubles semi-final.
They will face American duo David Wagner and Bryan Barten in Saturday's doubles final.
Adding to his doubles success, world number two Lapthorne has also booked his place in the quad singles final after defeating Sithole 6-0 6-3.
