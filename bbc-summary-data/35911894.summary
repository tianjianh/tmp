Captain Chamari Atapattu hit a crucial 52 as Sri Lanka stuttered to 114-7.
South Africa looked to be coasting in Bangalore as Dane van Niekerk (24) and Trisha Chetty (26) put on 50 for the first wicket inside nine overs.
But from there the Proteas collapsed, losing five wickets for 24 runs, and they fell short, finishing on 104-7.
Neither team advances from Group A, with New Zealand and Australia going through to the semi-finals where they will play West Indies and England respectively.
