A service has marked the 70th anniversary of a maritime disaster in which 47 people died.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The SS Samtampa ran aground at Sker Point, a headland in Bridgend county, on 23 April 1947 after attempting to sail through a force 11 gale.
All 39 members of crew died along with eight lifeboat rescuers sent from Mumbles, Swansea.
A service took place at Sker Point at 14:30 BST, following one at All Saints Church, Porthcawl on Saturday.
The 7,000-tonne steamer was travelling from Middlesbrough to Newport where it was due to be sold when it broke into three on the rocks.
There is a plaque and stained glass window at All Saints Church - where 12 of the crew were buried - commemorating the disaster.
After Sunday's service, the congregation walked to Sker Point, where two lifeboats similar to Edward Prince of Wales - the RNLI vessel destroyed in the rescue attempt - met them.
The Awen Trust, Porthcawl Sea Cadets and the Porthcawl Shout Forum have received Heritage Lottery funding for a £45,000 granite sculpture which will go outside a new £5.5m maritime centre in Porthcawl's harbour marina.
It is hoped the 6ft (1.8m) tall monument will be ready in about five months.
The group also secured funding for educational events including a public exhibition at the Senedd called "Porthcawl's secret tragedy", which runs from Monday until 8 May.
Gary Victor, chairman of Porthcawl Shout Forum, said it was important people remembered and younger people were educated about it.
"It was a gigantic event which happened on our coast but has gradually been forgotten," he said.
