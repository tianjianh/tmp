A 7-mile exclusion zone has been set up to protect residents from the spewing lava and ash that is created when Colima erupts.
It has caused huge disruption to those who have had to evacuate, as officials continue to monitor the volcanic activity.
In a statement the Mexican government said: "At the risk of falling ash, we maintain the recommendation to cover eyes and mouths, cover water tanks (and we advise) that people with respiratory problems avoid outdoor activities, and sweep the ash to be deposited in plastic bags.
