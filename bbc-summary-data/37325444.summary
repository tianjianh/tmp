[SN]TITLE[SN]
Grimsby Town 0-2 Crewe Alexandra

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A goal in each half saw Crewe claim a victory at Grimsby that lifts them into the top three in League Two.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
George Cooper grabbed the opener on the stroke of half-time after pouncing on a mistake from the hosts before James Jones added a second with five minutes to go.
Crewe were asking more questions throughout the first half and could have gone ahead on the half-hour mark when Josh Gowling handled in the box and Michael Salisbury pointed to the spot.
Chris Dagnall struck his penalty well but James McKeown sprang to his right to push away and maintain parity.
Grimsby had the ball in the net six minutes before the break when Ben Garratt spilled Omar Bogle's powerful shot but strike-partner Shaun Tuton was flagged offside as he tapped home.
The Alex got the goal their first-half display had deserved in stoppage time when they pounced on a mistake by Luke Summerfield and Cooper was played into the box to slot home.
After early appeals for a penalty were waved away, Grimsby continued to plug away in search of an equaliser, but Steve Davis' men sealed a deserved victory five minutes from time when Jones forced a late corner over the line from close range.
