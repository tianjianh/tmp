[SN]TITLE[SN]
Mersey Bar lightship 'Planet' up for sale

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A lightship which lit the way for vessels entering and the leaving the River Mersey has been put up for sale.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Mersey Bar lightship 'Planet' was towed from the river in September following a dispute between its owner and the Canal and River Trust.
The 133ft-long vessel was built in 1959 and provided a navigation aid to mariners approaching the entrance to the channel into the port until 1972.
It is listed for offers over Â£100,000.
Owner Alan Roberts bought the ship in 2009 and opened it as a cafeteria in 2011.
It was later moored alongside the Strand in Liverpool as a bar and tourist attraction before being towed on 21 September after the Canal and River Trust raised concerns about unpaid fees and health and safety.
