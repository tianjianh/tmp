The 34-year-old, who will compete for Ireland in the Rio Olympic Games next month, came home in a time of 0:58:23.
That left her one minute and 20 seconds behind American Kate Zaferes, who secured her first career victory, ahead of Rachel Klamer and Gwen Jorgensen.
Reid's performance equals her best result of the season as she was also 17th in Leeds on 11 June.
She was 40th in her first appearance in the series this year at Cape Town and was subsequently 48th in Yokohama and 21st in Stockholm.
The Derry woman lies 38th in the overall standings, with further rounds in Edmonton and Cozumel to come in September.
Reid missed the opening two rounds of the 2016 series in Abu Dhabi and the Gold Coast because of illness.
