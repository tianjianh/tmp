Slovakia 3-0 Scotland: Steven Thompson's Scotland player ratings

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Scotland's World Cup qualifying hopes suffered another setback with a sorry 3-0 loss in Slovakia.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Former Scotland striker Steven Thompson gives his marks out of 10 for Gordon Strachan's side.
He made a number of great saves in the match and prevented the scoreline from being embarrassing.
The Hearts 21-year-old tried to get forward and defended reasonably well in one-on-ones with the dangerous Robert Mak.
Scotland's best out-field player on the night. He offered so much offensively, especially in the first half. He looked a real threat every time he got on the ball. An accomplished performance for such a young player.
Not commanding enough. A below average display from an experienced defender.
Badly at fault for the third goal, allowing Adam Nemec to get the better of him at a corner for a simple header. You can tell he's not playing regularly at club level.
Tried very hard to shackle Slovakia danger man Marek Hamsik and marshal the rest of his team-mates.
Came in for Oliver Burke after scoring the late equaliser against Lithuania and worked hard but tired in the second half and faded out of the game.
Loose in possession, with lots of stray passes on a night Scotland failed to build any real attacking momentum. Managed two shots in the second half but both were saved comfortably.
Not his best night following a poor display against Lithuania. Wasteful in possession in the first half and anonymous after the interval. One poor shot on goal from a promising position at 1-0 down.
Too many poor crosses and guilty of making the wrong choices in the final third too often.
Given a tough job up front on his own without much in the way of support. Should have done better with a header in the first half with the score at 0-0.
The Celtic striker looked sharp and had two decent efforts on goal.
Tried to make things happen with some direct runs down the left but the cause was lost by the time the changes were made.
Got stuck in when he came on and played one great pass through to create a good opening for Leigh Griffiths.
