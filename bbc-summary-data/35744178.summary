Charles Hunter, who was in the Merchant Navy and RAF, has lived at Bield's Liberton Park Court for 27 years.
The father-of-three's aunt also lived to 100 and one of his two sisters reached 95.
The widower believes that living a healthy and active lifestyle has helped him remain in good health.
He said: "I have always made a point of drinking lots of water and having a proper breakfast of porridge, eggs and toast.
"Before I was married my interests were mainly sporting ones, I enjoyed swimming, hockey, football, boxing and running was my favourite. Later in life I gained an interest in DIY and I used to bake a lot, so I have always been an active person."
Mr Hunter was a pupil at South Morningside, Lorne Street and Burdiehouse primary schools before going on to George Heriot's School.
He was posted to Iraq and Yemen during World War Two, and was promoted to the rank of sergeant.
On leaving the military, he went on to spend much of his life working in the food industry as a warehouse manager.
Mr Hunter married his wife, Rachel, in 1942 after being introduced through his sister Mina who worked alongside Rachel in the Navy, Army and Air Force Institutes.
His wife, Rachel, died in 2012 at the age of 97.
They had three children, two sons and a daughter. Their eldest son died in 2008.
He has eight grandchildren and one great-grandchild.
