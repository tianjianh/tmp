A further 22 people suffered injuries from burns and smoke inhalation from the blaze in the city of Obour, media reports said.
The fire is thought to have started after a gas canister exploded while it was being transported in a lift.
The factory had not obtained a government safety certificate, Egyptian state media reported.
More than 20 fire trucks eventually brought the blaze under control.
Such accidents are relatively common in Egypt. A separate fire at a food market in Alexandria, Egypt's second-largest city, has injured at least 11 people.
