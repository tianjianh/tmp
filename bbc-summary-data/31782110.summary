[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The body of Drew Jordan was found in the quarry he owned in Eskra, near Omagh, on Thursday evening.
The death of the father-of three, who was in his 50s, is being investigated by the Health and Safety Executive for Northern Ireland (HSENI).
The police have confirmed his death is not being treated as suspicious.  His funeral is to be held on Sunday.
The Reverend Noel Regan, a local clergyman who knows the family, told the Ulster Herald: "There is widespread shock and grief at this tragic accident."
He said Mr Jordan was very well regarded in the area.
A spokesperson for the HSENI said the organisation had been "made aware of a fatality at a quarry in Omagh and is investigating".
"Our thoughts are with the family at this most difficult time," they added.
