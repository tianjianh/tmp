[SN]TITLE[SN]

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Jofra Archer claimed seven wickets as Sussex bowled Kent out for 304 in their County Championship match at Hove.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Archer, 22, took a maiden first-class five-wicket haul in a devastating spell of 7-67 to combine with Ajmal Shahzad (3-91) and dismiss the away side.
Opener Sean Dickson scored a patient 68 before a 123-run stand between Darren Stevens (68) and Wayne Parnell (51 not out) earned Kent a third batting point.
Chris Nash fell lbw to Matt Coles as Sussex reached stumps at 11-1 in reply.
Playing in just his eighth first-class match, fast bowler Archer was outstanding, sending Kent opener Daniel Bell-Drummond's middle stump cart-wheeling and later dismissing Dickson and Adam Rouse in successive balls to expose the middle order at 152-6.
Kent had the partnership of Stevens and Parnell to thank, with the two all-rounders counter-attacking well before Archer returned to clean up the tail.
