The body of a girl was found in Shipley on 19 May, 2011 and West Yorkshire Police hopes to identify the baby who was about three days old.
Her remains were discovered by staff at the Associated Waste Management depot last year.
The appeal comes as police talk with the coroner about the the infant's remains being released for a funeral.
Officers have sent 37,000 letters to homes in Bradford and Leeds to appeal for information in the past year.
Scientific work has now provided officers with a DNA profile of the child, although a matching profile of her mother is not on record.
It is believed the baby's delivery did not take place in a hospital and a post-mortem test failed to ascertain a cause of death.
Det Supt Sukhbir Singh, who is leading the investigation, said: "I would again urge the child's mother and family to come forward and help us identify her baby girl as she is laid to rest."
Police believe the mother of the baby is from the West Yorkshire area.
Staff at the waste management depot have taken an interest in supporting the funeral of the baby according to the police.
Anyone with information should contact West Yorkshire Police.
