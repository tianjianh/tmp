The Hope Beyond Hurt event features experts in conflict resolution from the US, England and Palestine.
It is part of a wider project that will culminate in the opening of a garden of reflection in the city.
One of the conference's organisers, Susan Glass of the Holywell Trust, said it was a chance to hear different perspectives.
"I think it's really important that as a society in Northern Ireland, we look beyond ourselves," she said.
"We are very good at looking inwards and it's often good to hear another story from somewhere else in the world, to hear how people at the sharp end of conflict deal with victims and survivors in conflict and post-conflict societies, and how we can learn from that."
