The Upper Lough currently stands at 14 centimetres below the pre-Christmas peak.
A number of roads in the county remain closed following the recent flooding.
Water levels at Lough Neagh recently reached a 30-year-high after heavy rain from storms Desmond, Eva and Frank.
Armagh Observatory said December had been the wettest on record at the institute.
It said the total amount of water recorded as falling was nearly 7.33 inches (18.61cm).
However, it said it was also the warmest December at Armagh since 1988.
Agriculture Minister Michelle O'Neill visited homes affected by flood water outside Lisnaskea, County Fermanagh, on Tuesday.
Ms O'Neill said it was "very evident" that for some residents, the only suitable form of transport was a tractor.
She said the flooding was causing difficulties to everyday life and "massive challenges for those who live around Lough Erne, particularly in Fermanagh".
On Thursday, Ms O'Neill held an urgent meeting with the environment and regional development ministers to discuss the response to the recent flooding.
