Labour leadership: Smith 'wants referendum on EU deal'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Labour leadership contender Owen Smith wants a second public vote to approve any Brexit deal the UK strikes with the EU, according to a newspaper.

Mr Smith told the Guardian there should be a general election or referendum "when the terms are clear".
He said it was clear people wanted both access to the single market and controls on immigration.
He is challenging Jeremy Corbyn to become Labour leader, with fellow MP Angela Eagle also standing.
Mr Smith accused Mr Corbyn of acting selfishly, and said Labour was "teetering on the brink of being destroyed".
Ms Eagle said she and Mr Smith were not "very different" in terms of political views, but she had more experience and "further reach".
Mr Corbyn has rejected calls to stand down, saying he was elected as leader with a "very large mandate" 10 months ago and would campaign on "all the things that matter".
One Labour donor is launching a legal challenge to party's ruling that Mr Corbyn can be automatically included in the leadership ballot.
His rivals need the backing of 51 MPs or MEPs to stand.
In the Guardian interview, Mr Smith said the public should be given "another chance" once they knew what Brexit deal had been agreed.
"That does mean a second referendum or a general election when the terms are clear. The Labour government should be committing to that," he said.
He said many people voted for Brexit in "good faith", but many had been "misled by the Brexit campaign" and were now thinking it was the wrong decision.
Labour's role "is to be sensible and mature about this and put our foot on the ball for the British public and say what do the terms actually look like", he added.
After the 23 June referendum, Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt also suggested the public should give their verdict on the UK's deal with the EU via another referendum or general election.
There have also been calls for a second public vote on EU membership itself, though the government rejected a petition demanding this.
BBC Reality Check examined these issues and concluded that another membership referendum was "unlikely", while a vote to ratify the UK-EU deal was "possible but not required by current legislation".
Speaking about her bid to lead Labour, Ms Eagle said Mr Corbyn "cannot provide" leadership in Parliament and was "not going down well on the doorstep" with Labour voters.
She said Mr Smith was a "perfectly fine man" whose views were similar to her own.
But she added: "I think I have further reach as a northern woman from working-class roots, as a person who understands identity politics... as a gay woman. I think I've got the toughness and the experience."
Announcing his leadership campaign on Wednesday, Mr Smith said Labour needed someone "radical and credible" in charge.
The Pontypridd MP, who quit as shadow work and pensions secretary last month, said he could "heal" the party and "turn the page" on its internal strife.
