Lewis Hamilton said he would regroup after a dispiriting Singapore Grand Prix as he attempts to get his world title challenge back on track.

His team-mate Nico Rosberg reclaimed the lead by eight points with victory at Marina Bay as Hamilton came third.
"It doesn't always go well and this has been a difficult weekend for me and my side of the garage," Hamilton said.
"But we will reunite and regather and understand what went wrong and try to rectify it for the next race."
It was Rosberg's third victory in succession and eighth of the year, compared with six for Hamilton.
But the world champion pointed to the fact that he had already come back from a 43-point deficit to Rosberg after the first four races of the season as a reason for optimism.
"All in all, with everything that's gone on this year, I'm still in the fight," Hamilton said. "There's still a long way to go and I'm going to give it everything I've got."
Hamilton said he had never got on top of the car all weekend.
"Struggled with the balance, struggled getting on to the pace myself and then in the race struggled with the brakes, which meant I had to drive slow until they cooled down, which they never did until close to the end," he said.
But he paid tribute to the performance of Rosberg, whose victory was founded on a brilliant pole position lap, which was 0.7 seconds quicker than Hamilton could manage in qualifying.
"I don't really have a reaction [to losing the championship lead]," Hamilton said. "Nico did a fantastic job and the points he gained today he fully deserved."
Rosberg, as he has done all season, minimised the importance of the championship position between the two drivers.
"I'm not focused on points," he said. "As I always say, I'm just happy with the win."
