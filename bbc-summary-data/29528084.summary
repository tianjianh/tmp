[SN]TITLE[SN]
'Naked rambler' Stephen Gough jailed for Asbo breach

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man known as the "naked rambler" has been jailed for two-and-a-half years after walking out of prison wearing only his boots and socks.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Former Royal Marine Stephen Gough, 55, was found guilty by a jury at Winchester Crown Court of breaching an anti-social behaviour order (Asbo).
The order bans him from taking off his clothes in public.
He had refused to put on clothes as he left Winchester Prison after being imprisoned for a previous Asbo breach.
Judge Jane Miller QC suggested moves should be made to find Gough a closed nudist community to live in to prevent the cycle of imprisonment which has seen him jailed for much of the past eight years.
Gough earned his nickname when he completed a naked trek from Land's End to John O'Groats in 2003.
A BBC documentary team followed his journey.
He had previously argued there was nothing intimidating about him appearing "in his natural human state".
