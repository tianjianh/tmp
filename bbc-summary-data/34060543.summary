[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
England's most capped player Fara Williams has tipped strikers Beth Mead and Nikita Parris to earn their senior debuts in next month's European Championship qualifying opener.

Sunderland's Mead, 20, is Women's Super League One's top scorer with 11 goals, while Manchester City's Parris, 21, has netted five times in all competitions.
Mark Sampson's England side start their qualifying campaign in Estonia.
"They're certainly two players he could look at," Liverpool's Williams said.
"Nikita Parris has been doing well for Man City, while Beth Mead's been scoring many goals in the league. I'm sure Mark, being the manager that he is, will give these young talents a chance in our first qualifier."

Parris, who is on loan at Manchester City from WSL 2 side Everton, and Sunderland's Mead have represented England from Under-17 to Under-23 level.
Midfielder Williams, 31, who has won 147 caps in a 14-year senior international career, is unlikely to be selected herself because of a hamstring injury.
She has featured just just twice for Liverpool since returning from the Women's World Cup, where she helped seal England's bronze medal-finish with the extra-time penalty against Germany in their third/fourth-place play-off match.
"When you've never experienced a long-term injury it's a little bit frustrating, but I'm getting there," she told BBC Sport.
"It's frustrating but I have to be patient with it. I guess with the season nearly coming to an end, there's nothing really to rush back for.
"It's really hard, especially when you're used to playing and starting most games so it's difficult."
Speaking at the launch of Standard Chartered's new campaign #ThisGirlsGoal, Williams said she hoped to return to action before Liverpool begin their European campaign in October.
"Champions League football, as we experienced last year, is completely different and a lot more difficult than our league," she continued.
"It would be nice to get a game in before then if I can, but if I can't then I'm certainly hoping to be back for the Champions League."
