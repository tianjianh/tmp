The 26-year-old was also due to be in the squad for five one-day internationals and two Twenty20s.
Chris Woakes, Chris Jordan or Mark Footitt will replace him for the final Test, while his place in the limited-overs squads goes to Liam Plunkett.
Finn is expected to be fit for the World Twenty20 in India.
England's first match in that tournament is on 22 March against New Zealand.
Middlesex right-armer Finn, who returned to the England Test side during the 2015 Ashes after a two-year absence, was not originally part of the squad to tour South Africa.
He missed the series against Pakistan in the UAE with a foot injury but, after returning to fitness, was added to the party for South Africa and named in the Test side.
Finn has taken 11 wickets to help England to a series victory that was sealed with a seven-wicket win in Johannesburg on Saturday.
However, he felt discomfort in his left side on day two of the match at the Wanderers and scans subsequently revealed a strain.
England will chase their biggest series win in South Africa for more than 100 years in the fourth Test at Centurion on Friday.
Warwickshire's Woakes played the first Test in place of the injured James Anderson, his fellow right-armer Jordan has not played a Test since May, while Surrey left-armer Footitt - capable of bowling in excess of 90mph - is uncapped.
South Africa, meanwhile, have added uncapped opener Stephen Cook to their squad.
