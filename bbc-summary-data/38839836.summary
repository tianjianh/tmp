The critically acclaimed The Cheviot, The Stag and the Black, Black Oil and Witness for the Prosecution were among the Dundee Rep Theatre productions.
Turnover and grants received also increased in the last financial year.
Scottish Dance Theatre, which last year celebrated its 30th anniversary, produced two new works and toured seven productions around the world.
Dundee Rep and Scottish Dance Theatre Limited reported a turnover of £1.764m, compared to £1.501m the previous year, the report noted.
It received £2.928m in grants, an increase of £47,885 from last year.
Creative Learning, which works with communities and schools, saw increased participation to more than 35,000 students.
Chief executive Nick Parr said he has been "blessed" with a supportive team who had "embraced the need for change."
He said: "Our two ensemble model, developed over the past two decades, is a beacon of quality that we are lucky to have in Dundee and, indeed, Scotland.
"No other organisation can boast permanent ensembles of dancers and actors and it is vital that our immensely supportive funders continue to work with us to preserve our wonderfully creative company."
