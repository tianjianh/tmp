[SN]TITLE[SN]
York City 2-2 Sutton United

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
York's winless run was extended to 10 matches as two Sutton penalties frustrated the hosts in a 2-2 National League draw.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Things started badly for the Minstermen when Simon Heslop fouled Craig Eastmond in the box. Defender Jamie Collins stepped up to send Scott Flinders the wrong way.
Daniel Nti however responded quickly for York, dinking a beautiful shot over Ross Worner from a tight angle.
Substitute Danny Galbraith put Gary Mills' men in front from 25 yards, courtesy of a deflection over Worner.
Sutton's Dean Beckwith was sent off for receiving two yellow cards in the latter stages, but his side salvaged a draw when Eastmond was fouled in the box for the second time, and again Collins placed in calmly.
