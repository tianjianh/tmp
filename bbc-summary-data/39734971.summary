Burnley manager Sean Dyche says Joey Barton's 18-month ban for breaching betting rules is "harsh".

The 34-year-old midfielder received the punishment on Wednesday after admitting a Football Association charge.
Barton, who placed 1,260 bets on matches between 26 March 2006 and 13 May 2016, has admitted he is addicted to gambling.
"Eighteen months seems a long time to me in light of other things I've seen in the sport," said Dyche.
"Eric Cantona was given a nine-month ban for a kung-fu kick."
Barton plans to appeal against the length of the suspension, calling it "excessive".
Dyche confirmed Barton, who re-joined Burnley from Rangers on a short-term deal in January, will not be offered a new contract in the summer.
The ex-England international was in his second spell at Turf Moor before the ban, having helped the Clarets reach the Premier League in the 2015-16 season.
"We thought there was a chance, of course [of this happening]," added Dyche. "We're not naive. Joey understood that. On the football side of things we didn't want it to get in the way of thinking he was a worthwhile player to bring back. We wanted to get on with it, give him a platform and he's done that."
