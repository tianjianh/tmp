A neglected "secret garden" on the outskirts of Swansea is to be restored after a group hoping to save it from demolition secured a £1.8m grant.

Campaigners have worked for 25 years to get the Grade II listed walled garden on the Penllergare Estate repaired and reopened to visitors.
Now, Heritage Lottery Fund (HLF) has earmarked money to help turn it into an "escape from hectic city life".
HLF said it could become "a significant tourist destination".
Terry Jones of the Penllergare Trust said the group was "really excited" the garden would be saved from "dereliction and inappropriate development".
Work will include the refurbishment of the garden's orchid house, which is currently in a state of serious disrepair.
The funding follows £2.3m of lottery money already provided to restore Penllergare Valley Woods.
