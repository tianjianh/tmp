Boeing receives order for 40 planes from Qatar

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
US aircraft maker Boeing has announced a major deal to supply Qatar Airways with wide-body jetliners.

The deal includes 30 787-9 Dreamliners and 10 777-300ERs, valued at $11.7bn (Â£9.4bn) at list prices, along with the option to buy 60 737 MAX 8s, valued at $6.9bn at list prices.
It is the largest single order ever placed by the Gulf carrier.
The deal gives Boeing a boost in a year when orders for widebody planes have slumped.
Qatar has been frustrated over prolonged delivery problems from Boeing's European rival aircraft maker, Airbus.
Media reports last week suggested the deal was for at least 30 Boeing 777 and 787 jets, valued at about $6.7bn.
Airplane makers typically give large discounts on the list price when carriers order in bulk.
The continuing fight between Qatar Airways and Airbus has turned nasty - with Boeing emerging as the big winner.
The chief executive of the Gulf carrier, Akbar Al Baker, is a forthright individual. He has previously described his airline's relationship with Airbus as "strained" because of delivery delays and engine problems with the Airbus A320neos.
Now Akbar Al Baker is sending Airbus a message, with a big order for its American rival. The mega deal is not just a financial winner for Boeing. It's also a huge boost for the US plane maker's single aisle 737 MAX aircraft.
It is the US aerospace giant's newest plane and doesn't go into service until next year.
And politics may also be at play.
There was a suggestion that the Qatar government may have delayed the Boeing passenger jet order to put pressure on the US to approve a deal for Boeing fighter jets to the Middle Eastern country - a deal which the Americans now look set to approve.
