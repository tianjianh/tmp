Australian airline launches frequent flyer points for pets

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An Australian airline has launched a new reward scheme especially for passengers with four legs!

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Cats and dogs taken on flights within Australia can now earn loyalty points for their owners.
When enough points are collected, the owners can spend them on in-flight treats.
Unfortunately for the moggies and doggies, they'll have to stay in the animal carrier on the plane.
