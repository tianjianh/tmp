[SN]TITLE[SN]
Louise Wright cyclist death: Lorry driver 'didn't see' woman

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A lorry driver told a court he did not see a cyclist before she was dragged under his vehicle and killed.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Louise Wright was on her way to work in Nottingham when her bike was struck at traffic lights by Adam Haywood's beer delivery truck in July 2014.
Derby Crown Court heard he failed to check his mirrors before turning left and hitting Ms Wright.
He denies causing death by careless driving and said he believes Miss Wright was in his blind spot.
Miss Wright, 29, was killed instantly at the junction of Lower Parliament Street and Pennyfoot Street in Nottingham city centre on 3 July 2014.
In court Mr Haywood, 31, from Whitwell, Derbyshire, was asked by defence barrister Paul Rogers: "Did you see Miss Wright in your mirrors?"
He replied: "No."
Mr Rogers asked: "If you had done what would you have done?"
Sobbing, he replied: "I would have stopped."
The trial has heard that Mr Haywood was stationary at the traffic lights when Miss Wright cycled down the left side of his lorry and waited near the front of his truck.
Jurors were told it is not illegal for a cyclist to come up the inside of a lorry, but the Highway Code recommends not to do so.
Mr Haywood told the jury he could not remember if he had put on his indicators, but that was his normal practice.
Jurors were told there is nothing in law to say that a driver must indicate, but the Highway Code says they should.
The trial continues.
