Yorkshire have qualified for the One-Day Cup knockout stages despite a five-wicket defeat by Warwickshire.

Captain Ian Bell made 98, aided by Jonathan Trott (70), Sam Hain (55) and Rikki Clarke's unbeaten 44 as the Bears reached 284-5 with 15 balls to spare.
Earlier, Yorkshire lost Adam Lyth to Keith Barker (2-39) to the first ball of the game before Joe Root scored 83.
Tim Bresnan made 65 and Matthew Waite 71 but the hosts, led by Grant Thornton (3-63), restricted Yorkshire to 281-8.
Yorkshire slip to second, replaced at the top of the North Group by Worcestershire, who beat Durham, but their 10 points from seven matches means they cannot now slip outside the top three.
One-Day Cup holders Warwickshire, who had previously won just once in seven group games, made the perfect start when Lyth was caught behind for a golden duck.
Jonny Bairstow fell to Clarke for eight and when England team-mate Root was fifth man out for a 98-ball 83, Yorkshire were 149-5.
But Bresnan and Waite shared a sixth-wicket stand of 116 to push the visitors to respectable total.
In reply, Trott and Hain put on 124 for the first wicket in 20 overs before Bell, fresh from his first century in 13 months against Worcestershire on Friday, hit a much more rapid 98 from 85 balls, including three sixes and 11 fours.
Despite Warwickshire's struggles, Bell has been in fine form in the One-Day Cup. He has passed 50 four times in eight games, having scored 51 against Notts, 93 at Derby and 104 at Worcester.
Clarke's 49-ball unbeaten 44 eased Warwickshire home to move off the bottom of the North Group in their final game.
Warwickshire spinner Jeetan Patel told BBC WM:
"We have come off a run of a few really bad losses and some that were quite tight but credit to the guys for the way they came out.
"We wanted to bowl well, field well and bat well and those three knocks from Ian Bell, Jonathan Trott and Sam Hain were fantastic.
"Keith Barker bowled 10 really good overs up front and got us two crucial wickets and then Rikki Clarke got that third one for us.
"Grant Thornton bowled really well which is where we need to get to. We are an ageing teams with a lot of experience but we need to be able to trust the younger guys."
Yorkshire all-rounder Matthew Waite told BBC Radio Leeds:
"It was disappointing to lose but we are still in a good position. We have got Leicestershire on Tuesday so hopefully we can beat them at Headingley.
"I enjoyed my innings. It was just a shame we didn't win. But it was nice to get my first 50 for Yorkshire. I got 40 last week against Northants and that gave me a bit of confidence coming in.
"It's just nice to be in a side with six internationals and pleasing to know I that I can play in a side that good. Tim Bresnan has given me a lot of help. He just told me to stand still and hit the ball. Just that little bit of advice can make all the difference"
