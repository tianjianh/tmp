The ex-Liverpool and Chelsea striker fell heavily after an 85th-minute aerial challenge with Alex Bergantinos.
He will remain under observation but Atletico confirmed scans showed he has "no traumatic alterations or injuries".
The Spain international, 32, released a statement saying: "It was just a scare. I hope to come back very soon."
Speaking at his post-match news conference, Atletico coach Diego Simeone said he was "worried and nervous" when the incident happened.
"We heard the blow from the bench, we saw how he fell and we were afraid," he said. "We didn't know if that noise was Fernando's neck or not."
Atletico finished the game with 10 men, having used all three substitutes, but earned a point thanks to Antoine Griezmann's stunning 30-yard strike.
Deportivo had taken an early lead in Pepe Mel's first game in charge when Florin Andone capitalised on a poor Jan Oblak goal-kick.
"In the end I do not care about the result," said Griezmann. "I just want to know what's up with Fernando and hopefully he's fine. And he gets back to us soon."
Atletico left-back Filipe Luis added: "It's very ugly to see it, we were all scared but at least the news we have received so far is good and the most important thing is that Fernando is well."
The draw leaves Atletico fourth in La Liga - 11 adrift of leaders Barcelona - while Deportivo are now 17th.
