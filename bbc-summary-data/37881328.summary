[SN]TITLE[SN]
Wycombe Wanderers 2-0 Morecambe

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Luke O'Nien and Aaron Pierre scored second-half goals as Wycombe Wanderers picked up a welcome three points against Morecambe.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The first half produced few clear-cut chances but Morecambe did go close when Paul Mullin was found by James Jennings, only to see his shot from eight yards well saved by Jamal Blackman in the Wycombe goal.
Pierre put the hosts ahead early in the second half, beating goalkeeper Barry Roche with a header from six yards out after meeting a Joe Jacobson free-kick.
Morecambe were denied a penalty in response when Matt Bloomfield appeared to handled in the box, but the referee gave a free kick which Michael Rose hit against the post.
And the Shrimps' hopes of a comeback were dashed when O'Nien nipped in front of his marker to head Paul Hayes' cross into the Morecambe goal with just nine minutes remaining.
Wycombe's first win in five league games moves them to 16th in the League Two table.
