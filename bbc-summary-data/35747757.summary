Portsmouth boss Paul Cook says Tuesday's game against his former club Accrington is "huge for both sides".

Fifth-placed Pompey face fourth-placed Accrington looking to close a nine-point gap on League Two's top three.
"I think the teams above us, Oxford and Plymouth, will be both wanting us to draw," Cook told BBC Radio Solent.
"From our point of view and (Accrington manager) John Coleman's, a win for either club would put them in a position to challenge those above."
Portsmouth kept their play-off push on track with a 2-0 win at Stevenage on Saturday. But, Cook's side have not been in the automatic promotion places since the start of November.
"We've got to make sure that we're the team that wins the game," Cook added.
"We're going there to win the game and Accrington are exactly the same, they've had a fantastic season.
"It comes on the back of the players they've signed and the hunger and desire they have shown to go on and better themselves."
