Clinton Morrison has extended his contract at League Two Exeter City.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 36-year-old former Republic of Ireland international agreed a deal until the end of August earlier this month, but will now stay at St James Park until after Christmas.
Morrison has featured as a substitute in four of Exeter's seven games so far this season.
He initially joined the club on non-contract terms last year before signing a permanent deal in January.
In April, Morrison told BBC Sport he would only consider extending his 17-year career as a professional if it was with Exeter City.
