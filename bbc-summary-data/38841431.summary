[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Two decapitated lambs have been discovered on farmland in Dorset.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A two-month-old animal was found near Dorchester on Tuesday morning and a second was found nearby early the following day.
Dorset Police said it appeared that the animals had been deliberately beheaded using a sharp blade, rather than being attacked by predators.
PC Clare Dinsdale said it was "a shocking but, thankfully, rare event" and appealed for information.
