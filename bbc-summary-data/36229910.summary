Captain Scott Brown will miss Celtic's final three Premiership games because of inflammation in both hamstrings.

The midfielder, 30, is also likely to miss Scotland's friendlies against Italy on 29 May and France on 4 June.
"I cannot be 100% sure of that, but I think that he needs a rest now to get ready for next season," said outgoing Celtic manager Ronny Deila.
"He has been injured for three months since the start of this year and pushed himself through a lot of games."
Deila paid tribute to Brown for playing through the pain barrier to help Celtic to a fifth successive Scottish Premiership title, and a second under the Norwegian.
"It has been unbelievably important. On the pitch he is unbelievable, in training as well - always 100%.
"That is what I was saying before I came here, talking to the players on the first day - we need players giving 100% and he has been a good ambassador for that.
"He can handle a lot of pain as well, and also is a leader in good times and bad times.
"I think to get the best out of him - for Celtic and for Scotland - I think it is important to give him some rest now."
Celtic, nine points ahead with three games left and a better goal difference of 35 than second-placed Aberdeen, have effectively wrapped up the Premiership title.
But a point against the Dons at Parkhead on Sunday would confirm their second straight title under Deila's stewardship.
