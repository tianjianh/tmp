The man, who was white and aged 65-75, was found fully clothed by a cyclist near Dove Stone Reservoir near Oldham.
The day before he had gone into a pub and asked the way to "the top of the mountain" after travelling from Ealing Broadway to Manchester.
Police said they have been left baffled by the "very, very strange" case.
The man was discovered on 12 December with Â£130 and three train tickets, including a return to London Euston, in his pocket.
He was found near a hill known as Indian's Head.
Police do not believe the incident is suspicious but no wallet, mobile phone or other identification was found.
Detectives said one theory was the man may have found out he was poorly and had gone to the beauty spot to "get some peace".
Det Con Nichola Chapman, from Greater Manchester Police, said: "It is a very unusual set of circumstances for an adult male to be found with no identifiable features or possessions.
"For him not to be missed by someone since 12 December is extremely unusual."
The man arrived at Ealing Broadway just after 09:00 GMT on 11 December and was next picked up by CCTV at 09:50 at Euston, buying a return ticket to Manchester Piccadilly.
After arriving in Manchester at 12:07 he spent 53 minutes wandering around the station before heading into the city centre.
The next sighting was at the Clarence pub in Greenfield, Saddleworth, where he asked the landlord how he could get to the top of the hill.
Police describe the man as white, of slim build, with a receding hairline with grey hair to the side and back.
He had a large nose that may have been previously broken, and was clean shaven.
He wore a brown heavy jacket, blue jumper, white long-sleeve shirt, blue corduroy trousers and black slip-on shoes.
