The 22-year-old was ruled out for the rest of last season in January with an Achilles injury, having not featured since November with a hip complaint.
Thompson was returning to fitness but has suffered a similar injury which will keep him out until next year.
Sporting director Stuart Webber said the injury may see him miss the season.
