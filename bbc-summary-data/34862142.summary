Inverness say they have shown they will not stand for any misdemeanour after striker Dani Lopez was involved in an alleged spitting incident.

He has been suspended while the club investigates the incident during an under-20s match against St Johnstone in which the 30-year-old was sent off.
Caley Thistle manager John Hughes will not reveal details of the episode.
"We police ourselves and I think what we've done is the right action," he told BBC Scotland.
"I'm right behind the club in terms of our actions and what we did.
"It shows that the image of the club and values we try to put out to the city of Inverness and the young players at Inverness.
"I think the action we've taken has shown Scottish football that we're trying to do right for Scottish football and we don't have the SFA telling us what to do."
Hughes refused to speculate about what might happen to Lopez, the club having announced on Wednesday that they had suspended the Spaniard until further notice.
"There's still an investigation going on, we're still waiting on referee's reports, but one thing I will say is the image and profile of the club is foremost," he said.
"The action we have taken in terms of suspending Dani from the club until we know more is the right action.
"We'll not stand for any misdemeanour. I really stand by that. What happens in the future? I still think we have to sit down and make sure these decisions are calculated decisions that we're taken.
"You have to take the player into account as well. Dani is a foreign player over here, he's got his wife and kid. He's not got much support around him."
St Johnstone manager Tommy Wright has praised Caley Thistle's actions.
"They have acted swiftly and, if the alleged incident is proved to be right, they have taken the right course of action and I've got to commend them for the way they've handled it," he said.
Wright was not at the game but has had reports from his own coaching staff.
"I haven't spoken to the young player that was involved, but he's reacted and got sent off," said Wright. "He's disappointed he reacted to the incident.
"You have to be careful what you say. It is an alleged incident, but if it is proven what it is alleged to be, I think we've got to stamp that sort of thing out of the game."
Lopez has scored once in nine appearances since joining the Highlanders on a one-year deal in July after leaving La Roda in the summer.
He has played for several clubs in his homeland and has also had spells at Stevenage, Aldershot Town and Barnet.
