Joanne Dennehy: Killer gets legal aid for prison case

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Triple killer Joanne Dennehy has been awarded legal aid to fight for compensation over her "degrading" segregation in prison.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Dennehy, 33, from Peterborough, is serving life for the murders of three men and the attempted murders of two dog walkers in 2013.
She is challenging a decision to continue to keep her separated from other inmates.
A Ministry of Justice spokesman confirmed Dennehy received legal aid.
"We robustly defend compensation claims as far as the evidence allows, and have successfully defended two-thirds of prisoner claims over the last three years," he said.
"Prisoners should not get legal aid unnecessarily, and we have already stopped funding for cases that can be dealt with through existing complaints processes."
Dennehy is serving her sentence at HMP Bronzefield, where she had initially been segregated while on remand.
The High Court was told her continued isolation leaves her "tearful and upset" and is a violation of her human rights.
Joanne Dennehy: The woman with a 'sadistic lust for blood'
Jenni Richards QC, appearing for the prison, described Dennehy as "arguably the most dangerous female prisoner in custody".
She had been segregated over fears of a prison break by her and other inmates, and an alleged plan involved cutting off an officer's finger "to deceive the biometric security system at the prison".
Hugh Southey QC, for Dennehy, said the escape allegations were never properly put to her and no further action was taken.
He told Mr Justice Singh she was seeking a court ruling that her segregation amounted to "inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment" which is banned by the Human Rights Convention.
Dennehy, it is argued, should be compensated "to afford just satisfaction" for the breaches of her rights.
Mr Justice Singh is expected to reserve his decision until a later date.
Dennehy murdered Lukasz Slaboszewski, 31, Kevin Lee, 48, and John Chapman, 56, in March 2013 before dumping their bodies.
She went on the run and subsequently stabbed dog walkers Robin Bereza, 64, and 56-year-old John Rogers in Hereford.
