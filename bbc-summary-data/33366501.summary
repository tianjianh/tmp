The former Germany Under-21 international, 24, has agreed a three-year deal at Loftus Road.
"He fits the description of what we need for the Championship and he looks a very good player," said Rangers head coach Chris Ramsey.
Polter is QPR's fifth signing of the summer following relegation from the Premier League.
A former Wolfsburg trainee, Polter joined Mainz in the summer of 2013 and spent last season on loan at German second-tier side Union Berlin, scoring 14 goals in 29 appearances.
"Seb's a player who has been under the radar a little bit and our scouts have done a good job in identifying him," Rangers head coach Chris Ramsey said.
He added that Polter reminded him of "a Bobby Zamora of a few years ago".
Former Brighton, West Ham and Fulham striker Zamora left QPR last month after a three-and-a-half-year spell.
"If he can emulate anything like Bobby achieved here, that will be brilliant for the club," Ramsey said.
"I am sure he will enjoy working with us. This is a great club for him to come to in order to prove himself."
