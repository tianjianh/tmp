The athletes, nine of whom come from former Soviet Union nations, all tested positive for various steroids.
No gold medallists were among the 10, but there were three silver medallists from weightlifting and wrestling.
Greek triple jumper Chrysopigi Devetzi and Ukrainian pole vaulter Denys Yurchenko have lost their bronzes.
Six more athletes who did not win medals in 2008 were also disqualified, including Russia's Elena Slesarenko, who won gold in the women's high jump in Athens in 2004 but was only fourth in Beijing.
The IOC has been retesting samples from both the Beijing and London Games and it brings the total of banned athletes from 2008 to 76.
