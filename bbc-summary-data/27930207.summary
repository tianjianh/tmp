[SN]TITLE[SN]
Hinkley Point C pylon project moves forward

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Plans for more than 140 pylons connecting Hinkley Point to Avonmouth have been accepted for examination by the government.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
National Grid applied to install the overhead line which would carry electricity from the proposed new nuclear power station, Hinkley C.
The Planning Inspectorate has announced it will hold a six-month inquiry, during which local people can comment.
It will then make a recommendation to the Secretary of State.
Sir Michael Pitt, chief executive for the Planning Inspectorate, said the application "met the required tests" and the decision was made after "careful consideration".
"The applicant must now decide when to publicise the fact that its application has been accepted to proceed to examination and announce when members of the public will be able to register with the Planning Inspectorate as an interested party in the application," he added.
The National Grid plans were submitted last month. A company spokesman previously said it had taken "five years of consultation".
It will see 30-miles of overhead wires carried on pylons and a five-mile section under the Mendips, connecting the station, near Bridgwater, Somerset, to the National Grid's 400,000 volt substation at Avonmouth.
It would also see the removal of 246 pylons and 42 miles of cabling between Bridgwater and Avonmouth, and Nailsea.
Those against the pylons argue the entire route should be underground or sub-sea - but National Grid had previously said this option would be too expensive.
Now the plans have been accepted for examination, the documents will become public. A final decision will not be made until late 2015.
