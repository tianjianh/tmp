A heritage group has expressed concern war graves could be disturbed by a £500m cross-Channel electricity link.

Initial drilling for the France Alderney Britain Link, an undersea cable, has taken place in Alderney.
The National Anglo-Jewish Heritage Trail (JTrails) is worried about the proximity of the development to World War Two grave sites linked to Nazi labour camps on the island.
Alderney Renewable Energy said there would be "no impact on war graves".
Four labour camps were built in Alderney during the Nazi occupation of the Channel Islands.
Some historians put the number of deaths among workers and slave labourers - many of whom were Jewish or Russian - above 1,000.
JTrails believes graves of prisoners may be at Longis Common - one area where drilling was carried out in preparation for the FAB Link, which is due to be completed by 2020 at an estimated cost of £500m.
Marcus Roberts, JTrails director, said: "It is a matter of great concern if a war grave site is being potentially disturbed."
Mr Roberts said he believed more Jews died at Longis than at any other part of the island.
He added: "We are not against development, but it shouldn't be disturbing [potential war graves]."
The developer said it had undertaken a non-intrusive geophysical survey to "detect any areas of unknown archaeology" in the area.
Executive director Declan Gaudion said: "The proposed route for crossing Alderney has been very carefully selected with full support from the States and the Alderney Society."
Alderney politician Graham McKinley said there was "some concern and differences of opinion" on the island.
He added: "We are concerned about the possible discovery of human remains.  We have to be very careful."
