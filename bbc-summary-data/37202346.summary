A stalker who filed more than 100 bogus reports to police in a vendetta against her ex-boyfriend has been jailed for five years, police in London have said.

Sandra Danevska, 38, from Hammersmith, west London, accused the man of rape, stabbings and acid attacks.
She also subjected two women he later dated to "a traumatic online campaign".
Danevska, a nanny, used 60 fake names to implicate her ex-lover in a string of crimes, so officers visited his home 42 times, the Metropolitan Police said.
She created scores of bogus social media profiles and bombarded her victim's other girlfriends with "threatening" and "malicious" messages.
Danevska was found guilty on 29 June at Isleworth Crown Court of three counts of stalking involving serious alarm or distress and of two counts of perverting the course of justice.
She was jailed on Friday and issued with a restraining order.
The harassment started in 2011, but the series of hoax social media profiles were only traced to addresses linked to Danevska last year.
Det Con Dean Puzey said: "This woman's actions caused her victims unimaginable distress and the sentence reflects the serious nature of her offending.
"Danevska stalked multiple victims and used social media and the police crime reporting system to make their lives intolerable.
"Her ex-boyfriend, an entirely innocent man, found himself a suspect for rape, stabbings and acid attacks. The impact on his life in particular was horrendous."
