[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A cull of 200 Canada geese is to go ahead in the Lake District, despite more than 2,500 people signing a petition against the move.

Rangers said up to 1,000 of the birds had been causing environmental problems on Windermere and said other control measures had failed.
About 2,600 people signed a petition urging The Windermere Geese Management Group (WGMG) to reconsider.
However, it has announced it is to go ahead with the cull as planned.
Neil Ryding, who organised the petition, said he believed wildlife was a large draw for visitors to the Lake District and said the group should see that "going to shoot these birds is just wrong".
The group said the geese have a "serious negative impact" on the economy and the environment, adding to pollution within Windermere and the surrounding land.
A WGMG statement said: "The group understands the emotive nature of the proposals and the strong beliefs held by some people.
"But the group remains committed to its original course of action to carry out a managed cull of Canada geese on Windermere.
"We will carry out the cull professionally, quickly and humanely in partnership with the landowners."
TV presenter Bill Oddie and Queen guitarist Brian May also criticised the move.
May said the cull was not justified and humans should not "reach for the gun" each time there was a complaint about "inconvenience or a loss in income" relating to wildlife.
There are estimated to be about 1,200 Canada geese on Windermere at certain times of the year.
