The Rhinos completed the treble for the first time in their history as legends Jamie Peacock, Kylie Leuluai and Kevin Sinfield departed the club in style.
McDermott said: "It was a weird emotion when we won the Grand Final. It was more relief than anything because it would have been such a shame to have got there and not won it.
"Everyone loves a fairytale and looking at those three after that game I just thought 'this must be absolutely brilliant for them'."
