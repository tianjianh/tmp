A 17-year-old boy who was floored by a single punch was "lucky to be alive", a youth court judge has said.

Judge James Prowse lifted reporting restrictions on last month's assault on Moshe Fuerst in Manchester.
Mr Prowse said the attack on the Jewish teenager was not a hate crime although objectionable things were said.
He sentenced Joseph Kelly, 17, to 18 months of youth training detention for the attack and Zach Birch to 12 months for assaulting Moshe's friends.
Kelly admitted causing grievous bodily harm and actual bodily harm and assault by beating while Birch admitted causing actual bodily harm and assault by beating.
Mr Prowse said he lifted reporting restrictions at the youth court because of widespread media reporting that had put the hate crime claims in the public domain.
"The Crown has not offered any evidence that this was a hate crime... he was in the wrong place at the wrong time It was an alcohol-fuelled vicious attack," he said.
Holly Holden, prosecuting, said Moshe was with three friends at Bowker Vale tram stop in north Manchester on 5 September when they were attacked by Kelly and Birch who had been drinking after a day at Haydock Races.
One of the boy's friends was asked "Are you off to make some money?", which Ms Holden said he took to be an anti-Semitic remark that stereotyped Jewish people.
Kelly punched Moshe and kicked him after he fled to a nearby road.
The youngster came round, vomited and was admitted to hospital but later discharged, the court heard.
The next day he needed emergency surgery after collapsing at the cinema with his friends and was in a coma for four days.
The boy suffered a fractured skull, a bleeding brain and has yet to be given a long-term prognosis from his doctors.
Sasha Waxman, representing Kelly, said her client could not explain what happened and was apologetic and remorseful.
