Warner hit 119 off 115 balls with 14 fours and a six, while Mitchell Marsh contributed 76 as the hosts made 378-5 from their 50 overs.
New Zealand captain Kane Williamson top scored in the chase with 81, but Pat Cummins's 4-41 helped Australia win.
Number one ranked Australia lead the three-match series 2-0.
Only Indians Sachin Tendulkar (nine in 1998) and Sourav Ganguly (seven in 2000) have hit more one-day international hundreds in one year than Warner.
"It's the format that I perhaps thought wasn't my greatest but this year's been fantastic and I've got to keep going as well as I can," said Warner.
