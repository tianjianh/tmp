Rodgers, 44, has guided Celtic to the league title and the League Cup in his debut season since succeeding Ronny Deila.
The former Liverpool, Swansea City, Reading and Watford boss had signed a 12-month rolling contract last May.
"It just felt right," said Rodgers. "I couldn't be happier. I'm in the best place I could possibly be."
The Northern Irishman, whose deal will run until 2021, is chasing a potential domestic treble with Celtic facing Rangers in the Scottish Cup semi-final later this month.
Rodgers thanked the club's board for their commitment since appointing him in the summer.
"Professionally and personally I'm in a good place," he added. "A few years ago I might have been in a rush. But I have learnt to cherish what you have.
"It's the beginning of the journey, but there's a lot more to achieve."
Celtic chief executive Peter Lawwell described Rodgers as "one of the best coaches in Europe".
Lawwell added: "Brendan has made a huge impact at Celtic already.
"He's an outstanding manager and we believe he is one of the best coaches in Europe, if not world football. We're delighted that he has committed his future to Celtic."
Celtic are unbeaten domestically this season, having dropped points in the league against Rangers, Partick Thistle and Inverness CT.
Rodgers left Anfield after more than three years in charge.
The appointment of Brendan Rodgers last year was viewed as something of a footballing coup for Celtic. A big name with a big reputation.
After almost 12 months in charge, the title and League Cup have been secured, Celtic remain favourites for the Scottish Cup and with just seven game to go, they could finish the season unbeaten. It's safe to say he has lived up to his billing.
With each passing success though, there have been questions about how long he'll hang around in the Scottish game. This contract extension doesn't necessarily mean he will stay in Glasgow until 2021 but it's evidence of real ambition from the club and an indication from the manager that when he said recently he's never been happier, he meant it.
