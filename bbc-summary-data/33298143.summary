One of the world's largest and smelliest flowers has blossomed for the first time in Scotland.

Visitors are expected to flock to The Royal Botanic Gardens in Edinburgh (RBGE) at the peak of the plant's pungency over the next three days.
The giant Amorphophallus Titanum has a strong smell of rotting flesh.
Horticulturist Sadie Barber says she was ''thrilled to finally see and smell" the plant after "12 years of careful cultivation''.
The plant, which has the heaviest corm ever recorded (153.9kgs) has produced seven leaves in the 12 years that it has been at the garden, so horticulturists are "delighted to finally" have a flower.
Ms Barber, who was gifted the corm in 2003 by Hortus Botanicus in Leiden, Netherlands, said: "We are thrilled to finally see, and smell, this incredible curiosity of the plant world after 12 years of careful cultivation by the Horticulture team at RBGE.
"The spadix has so far reached an impressive height of 255cm and may even grow a few centimetres more in the next days.
"It really is one of the most extraordinary flowering plants we have ever seen, and great to think that something that grows naturally so far away can be enjoyed by visitors to the Garden here in Edinburgh.''
