Metal detecting enthusiast Wyman, who quit the band in 1993, found several of the items within the grounds of his Suffolk manor house.
He has loaned them to the Moyse's Hall Museum in Bury St Edmunds as part of its Lost Property exhibition.
The museum said it was "privileged" to have access to Wyman's collection.
Wyman, who had been a founder member of the Rolling Stones, has been a "serious detecting enthusiast" since he bought his first metal detector in the 1990s.
He said it helped him uncover the site of a Roman homestead.
His first find was a water jug, which he found at his own property near Bury St Edmunds.
It is on display together with a Bronze Age sword and palstaves bought for him by Rolling Stones drummer Charlie Watts.
Wyman started selling his own metal detectors in 2007 and told of his treasure-detecting adventures in his illustrated book Treasure Islands, co-written with Richard Havers.
His passion project became the inspiration for a song by Swede Mason.
The Lost Property exhibition is being held until 1 October.
