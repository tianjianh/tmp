Cyprus profile - Media

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Cypriot media mirror the island's political division, with the Turkish-controlled zone in the north operating its own press and broadcasters.

State-run radio and TV compete with private operators, and relays of Greek and Turkish stations are on air across the island.
Freedom of speech is generally respected and a vibrant private press often criticises the authorities, says US-based Freedom House.
There were more than 656,000 internet users by June 2012 (Internetworldstats.com). Access is unrestricted, says Freedom House.
