Except for one thing - he has a mental health problem.
Josh didn't speak to anyone about how he was feeling for over a year, which made life difficult.
When he eventually opened up to his dad about it, things started to get much better. He was much more able to cope with what he was going through.
Now, Josh has made this programme to encourage others to speak up about how they're feeling.
"I wish now that I'd said something sooner. I don't want any of you to go through what I did," he said.
"So please, if you're worried about how you're feeling, tell someone. There's loads of help out there and - trust me - things really can get better."
