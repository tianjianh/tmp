[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man has been convicted of murdering a 60-year-old grandfather, who was fatally stabbed in a London pub while trying to protect a barmaid.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Aiden O'Mahony died from a single stab wound in JJ Moon's pub on High Street, Hornchurch, on 10 January.
James Roberts, 31, from Hornchurch, will be sentenced at the Old Bailey on 6 January 2017.
The court heard how Mr O'Mahonny had been "peacefully enjoying a drink" when a fight broke out.
Roberts threatened the barmaid with "serious violence" after she asked him to leave the pub.
The Old Bailey heard Mr O'Mahony challenged Roberts, and when "Roberts asked him to go outside [Mr O'Mahony] agreed."
After the attack several customers had to barricade the pub door shut, as Roberts tried to force his way back inside, police said.
Mr O'Mahony's family said they were "devastated" by his death.
"Aiden was a very loved son, brother, partner and granddad," they added.
Det Insp Garry Moncrieff said: "Roberts was in a foul and aggressive mood and decided to just take it out on anyone who he felt crossed him.
Mr O'Mahony "was being a gentleman" but his "brave intervention unfortunately cost him his life", he added.
