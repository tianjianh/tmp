Hallam Hope opened the scoring in the 27th minute and struck again just 90 seconds later to put the hosts in charge at half-time.
But Lyle Taylor pulled one back just after the hour before substitute Tom Elliott completed the Dons' comeback six minutes later.
Bury's James Vaughan went close twice early on, while Taylor and Tom Beere dragged shots wide for the Dons.
Jacob Mellis then forced James Shea to parry before Hope latched on to Vaughan's flick to lob the visiting keeper.
Moments later Zeli Ismail found Hope in the right channel and the striker fired inside the far post to double Bury's lead.
Chris Robertson went close over as the Dons looked to get back in the game, before Taylor beat the offside trap to fire into the top corner.
Chris Whelpdale was then denied by Ben Williams but moments later fellow sub Dean Parrett crossed for Elliott to head home.
Bury went closest to winning it as Shea denied Hope, with Ismail volleying the rebound over.
