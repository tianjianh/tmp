The money will help the Selkirk-based company re-locate to larger premises in the Edinburgh area.
Tentel, which started up last year, offers no-contract broadband and telephone services.
The funding from Scottish Enterprise came in the form of Regional Selective Assistance (RSA).
Tentel currently employs 50 people and expects to increase the team to more than 100 full-time staff over the next 12 months.
It currently has 5,000 customers but is aiming to pick up a further 50,000 in the next year.
Tentel head of finance Daniel Halliday said: "This funding will be transformational to the pace at which we can grow our team and continue to serve our customers.
"We've already created a number of great job opportunities and this funding will allow us to create even more as we grow our business in the future."
