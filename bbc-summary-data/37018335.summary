[SN]TITLE[SN]
Eastleigh 2-4 Dover Athletic

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An incredibly eventful last 10 minutes saw Dover secure a 4-2 win at Eastleigh.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
After a goalless first half, Ryan Huddart's own-goal gave Dover the lead on 52 minutes, before Ross Lafayette doubled the advantage against his former club on the hour-mark.
Ryan Bird pulled one back for the Spitfires on 81 minutes, but that was just the start of the late action. Five minutes later, it looked like the hosts had rescued an unlikely point when Andy Drury poked home the rebound following Adam Dugdale's long-range effort.
Just a minute later the game turned again thanks to Jim Stevenson's strike, and there was still time for Dover striker Ricky Miller to make sure of the win.
