[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Gwynedd council is holding a series of meetings about plans to make £25m in budget cuts affecting public services.

The first evening meeting takes place at Ysgol Dyffryn Ogwen in Bethesda on Monday, with informal drop-ins starting on Tuesday at Y Felinheli.
The council's Gwynedd Challenge consultation has been launched amid concerns it faces tough decisions due to budget cuts.
Councillors will decide which services to protect and which to cut in 2016.
One unpopular idea is to close public access on Barmouth bridge to save £30,000 a year, which would mean walkers and cyclists facing a 16-mile (26 km) diversion.
