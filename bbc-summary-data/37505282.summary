The 29-year-old took the accolade after winning Wimbledon and the Olympics for a second time and helping Britain lift the Davis Cup.
More than 50 Scottish Olympians and Paralympians from the recent Rio Games attended the awards at the Edinburgh International Conference Centre.
Three-time winner Murray said he was "delighted" to be recognised again.
He said: "It has been a fantastic season for me winning Wimbledon and retaining my Olympic title, and I am delighted to be awarded the 2016 Scottish sportsperson of the year award for the third time, particularly given all the incredible performances by other Scots this year."
It was a successful night for tennis overall, with Britain's Davis Cup team named team of the year and Rio Paralympic gold and silver medallist Gordon Reid winning para-sport athlete of the year.
Rower Katherine Grainger, Team GB's most-decorated female athlete, won the lifetime achievement award.
Commonwealth Games judo medallist Stephanie Inglis was named team Scot of the year following her recovery from life-threatening head injuries after a motorbike accident in Vietnam earlier this year.
Paul Bush, chairman of Commonwealth Games Scotland, said: "These awards in their new format have been a resounding success as we celebrate what has been a truly outstanding year for Scottish sport.
"The phenomenal achievements of 2016 augur well as we look ahead to the Gold Coast Commonwealth Games in 18 months' time, where many of these athletes will go for gold for Team Scotland."
