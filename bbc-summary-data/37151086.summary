A former Catholic priest accused of historical sex offences has been returned to Britain from Kosovo after a five-year police hunt.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Lawrence Soper, 72, was arrested as he arrived at Luton Airport on Sunday on suspicion of nine offences of sexual assault allegedly committed over a period from 1972 to 1986.
Mr Soper had been detained in May under a European Arrest Warrant in Kosovo.
He is now being held in custody at a west London police station.
Mr Soper was arrested in 2010 and bailed, but failed to return to a London police station in March 2011.
A European Arrest Warrant was issued for him in 2012.
He is accused of committing offences at St Benedict's School in Ealing, west London, where he taught in the 1970s and 1980s.
After teaching at St Benedict's, Mr Soper became abbot of Ealing Abbey, which had founded the school and supplied monks to teach there.
Officers from the Metropolitan Police' s sexual offences, exploitation and child abuse command had appealed for help in tracing Mr Soper.
