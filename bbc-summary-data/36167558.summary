Steve Hall, the son-in-law of Ken Cresswell, said: "We want the men back in one piece, not many pieces."
It comes as RWE Npower announced plans to bring the rest of the building down by controlled explosive demolition.
The firm said it would use a technique which would see the structure fall away from the existing pile of debris.

But Mr Hall said: "We are totally against it and we will fight and do whatever we have to to stop that blast."
Speaking on BBC Radio Oxford, Mr Hall said the family were in doubt over the building falling "the way they want it to".
He said: "It could fall on the pile that's there which means the men will be buried under more material and metal.
"I don't know how they've come to the conclusion that the only way is to blast it."
In a statement RWE Npower said: "We understand that any potential work involving further explosive demolition on site causes distress for the families.
"Having explored other manual options, our experts have made it clear that the quickest and safest way to bring the building down is by controlled explosive demolition."
The plant was set for demolition when it collapsed on 23 February.
The bodies of Christopher Huxtable, 34, from Swansea, Ken Cresswell, 57, and John Shaw, 61, both from Rotherham, have not been found following the collapse.
The body of Michael Collings, 53, from Brotton, Teesside, was recovered from the site.
The cause of the collapsed boiler house is being investigated jointly by police and The Health and Safety Executive.
