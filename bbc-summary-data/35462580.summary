Dent has scored over 6,000 runs in 162 appearances for the county in all forms of the game.
The 25-year-old hit a career-best 268 as Gloucestershire drew with Glamorgan in their final game of the 2015 season.
"Having been here quite a while I need to step up and be one of the main players," he told the club website.
"I am a senior player now and I need to take on that sort of role.
"Last year I didn't have a stand-out season in white ball cricket so hopefully I can improve on that and keep going well in the red ball stuff."
