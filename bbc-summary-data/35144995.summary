Edinburgh's trams are on track to have carried more than five million passengers by the end of the year.

Latest figures for passenger numbers are 12% up on the same time last year, according to Transport for Edinburgh.
The busiest week was during the Edinburgh Festival season in August when 137,000 passengers were carried.
Five major rugby fixtures at Murrayfield and a Foo Fighters concert each added an extra 10,000 to the year's total.
The city's tram network opened at the end of May 2014, having been dogged by delays, overspends and legal wrangles with the contractors.
But transport chiefs have stressed that since then the system has proved popular, with a satisfaction survey in 2015 showing a 95% customer satisfaction rating and a 99% rating for reliability.
The projected total for passenger numbers throughout 2015 is 5.1 million, higher than the targets set out in the business model.
Car parking at Ingliston Park and Ride has also increased, up by 60% compared with the same time last year.
Councillor Lesley Hinds, chairwoman of Transport for Edinburgh, said: "These latest figures demonstrate the continuing popularity of Edinburgh Trams and add to the success of our first year of operations, which saw almost five million passengers ride the trams.
"We now want to build on this success for the future of the service, as we look to extend and develop the network to provide for even more people in Edinburgh."
Ian Craig, chief executive of Transport for Edinburgh, said: "Edinburgh Trams continues to go from strength to strength and this is because of a huge effort from the team over the past two years.
"Our first year of operations was a big success and a time of much excitement but the real test is sustainability and continuing high quality operations.
"The service we're delivering is great, it's highly reliable and, as a result, we're seeing more passengers get on board than last year.
"Edinburgh Trams is getting more popular and we want to make sure that trend continues for the benefit of the city."
