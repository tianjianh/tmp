Three of the girls spoke to the BBC's Tara McKelvey and said it was "amazing" to meet Ms Obama.
One asked the First Lady what civil rights issues other than gender equality are important, and she responded by saying education for all.
Another girl said Ms Obama pointed out that level and quality of education can be based on where one was born, and it made her want to help people with poor economic backgrounds receive an education.
