Northumbrian Water is placing protective screens at six places on the Tees, Tyne, Wear and Coquet in response to new regulations.
The Â£11m project aims to be completed by March 2020. Work has started at the Lumley pumping station on the Wear in Chester-le-Street.
Numbers of European eels have dramatically dropped since the 1980s.
Michael Walsh, Northumbrian Water project manager, said: "It's not known exactly why there's been such a dramatic decline, but this project will help ensure the safe passage of eels in our region and ultimately, I hope, will contribute to restoring populations."
Robbie Stevenson, from the Environment Agency, described the eels as "fascinating creatures".
He added: "They have a complex life cycle, beginning life in the Sargasso sea and undergoing several changes during their life maturing in European waters, before returning to the Sargasso to spawn."
