New photographs of Princess Charlotte, taken by her mother the Duchess of Cambridge, have been released to mark her first birthday.

The four photographs were taken in April at their family home in Norfolk.
The princess, who turns one on Monday, is seen walking - with the aid of a baby walker filled with blocks - for the first time in one of the images.
Kensington Palace said the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge were "delighted" to share the new pictures of Charlotte.
The princess was last seen in public at her christening last July - the first time the Cambridges had been seen as a family of four.
Photographs of the princess have been released sporadically, the most recent before her birthday pictures being one in which she is sitting on her great-grandmother's knee to mark the Queen's 90th birthday last month.
The Duchess of Cambridge took a series of photographs in the weeks after Charlotte's birth, in which she is seen being cradled by brother Prince George, and another set to mark her daughter's six-month milestone.
In March, the duke and duchess released a series of photographs taken on their skiing holiday to the French Alps.
Kensington Palace said in a statement: "The duke and duchess are very happy to be able to share these important family moments and hope that everyone enjoys these lovely photos as much as they do."
The new photographs show Charlotte wearing a blue collared dress with matching tights and white cardigan, and a similar outfit in pink.
The duke, duchess, Charlotte and Prince George live at Anmer Hall, on the Queen's Sandringham Estate.
