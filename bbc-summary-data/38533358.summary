The robbery happened at Earthy on Canonmills Bridge at about 21:40 on Thursday.
The men, who were carrying knives, robbed the premises of a three-figure sum of cash.
They were in their early 20s, of slim or slim-to-medium build. One of them was about 5ft 5in and the other was about 5ft 9in. Both had local accents.
The first man was wearing a light-grey, zipped, hooded top, grey tracksuit bottoms and plimsoll-type shoes.
The second man was wearing a dark greyish/blue hooded top, grey jogging bottoms and gloves and was carrying a green and cream duffel bag.
Police are appealing for witnesses.
Det Insp Graham Grant, of Police Scotland, said: "This robbery left two female members of staff shocked and distressed and deprived the business of their income.
"I am keen to speak to anyone who was in the area around 21:40 last night and who might have information that can assist us in tracing these suspects."
