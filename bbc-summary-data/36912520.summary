Briton Paul Tamasy and Eric Johnson's yet-to-be titled film will focus on Jamie Vardy and his journey from factory worker to top scoring striker.
Leicester City club beat 5000/1 odds to win the Premier League earlier this year.
"The story represents everything we love in a movie," Tamasy told Deadline.
Johnson added: "This is more than a sports film, it's a once-in-a-lifetime story about the fulfilment of impossible dreams and the strength of the human spirit.
"It's also a hell of a lot of fun. I'm extremely excited and proud to be a part of it."
The pair were nominated for the best original screenplay Oscar for David O Russell's 2010 biographical sports drama.
They lost out to David Seidler who wrote The King's Speech, which was coincidentally produced by Bedlam Productions - the same company behind the Leicester City film.
"We saw and heard first hand how highly respected and talented they both are - we very much wanted to find a way we might work together," Bedlam's Simon Egan said.
It is not known when the film will start production, nor when casting will begin.
