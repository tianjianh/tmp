Sound a bit average? Well, the wildlife she filmed was in her own garage.. and it was a baby bear with attitude!
The furry friend got trapped in the garage after the automatic door had gone down.
Then big mummy bear came to the rescue, cleverly opening the sliding door and growling at the naughty cub.
And then the cub managed to climb back down using a ladder against the wall!
