Mr Simpson, 22, from Embo, near Dornoch, has not been seen since he left the Dornoch Show dance on 26 July.
The body was found in the water more than 70 miles around the coast at Whitehills near Banff on Wednesday.
Police said "early indications" were that it may be Lachlan Simpson but the body had not been formally identified.
Mr Simpson's family said in a statement: "Police Scotland has kept us informed of the discovery of a body yesterday and they will continue to keep us updated on progress.
"We want to thank the public for their support during the search for Lachlan and would ask that our privacy be respected whilst these enquiries are carried out."
Mr Simpson's family and friends used social media networks and posters to raise awareness about his disappearance.
Posters were put up at the Belladrum Music Festival near Beauly and appeared at other venues in the Highlands.
Police also continued to make searches in and around the area where he was last seen.
