Nick Kyrgios: Suspended 28-day ban & fine for Stan Wawrinka jibe

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Nick Kyrgios has been given a suspended 28-day ban and $25,000 (£16,200) fine by the Association of Tennis Professionals for making lewd remarks about Stan Wawrinka's girlfriend.

The incident took place during their Rogers Cup match earlier this month.
An ATP review found the 20-year-old guilty of "aggravated behaviour".
The Australian had already received a $10,000 (£6,400) tournament fine for the "unacceptable comments", which were picked up by on-court microphones.
The fine and ban will be imposed if Kyrgios incurs any fines for verbal or physical abuse over the next six months, or accumulate fines totalling more than $5,000 (£3,200) for any other offences at ATP-sanctioned tournaments.
Although world number 41 Kyrgios apologised for the comments, Switzerland's French Open champion Wawrinka, 30, called for major action to be taken.
The ATP's head of rules and competition Gayle David Bradshaw said: "This incident reflected poorly on our sport.
"Nick has expressed regret. The best result would be that he learns a lesson and that he understands he is responsible to the tour and to fellow players for both his actions and his words."
Kyrgios also received a $2,500 (£1,600) fine for unsportsmanlike conduct relating to a comment made to a ball person during the Rogers Cup match in Montreal.
He previously came under heavy criticism for his behaviour after appearing to stop trying when he was given a code violation during his defeat by France's Richard Gasquet at Wimbledon in July.
