The Welsh side lead 1-0 from the first leg at Bangor's Nantporth Stadium.
"We will put balls in the box and we will score a goal, and we will need to. You can't keep a team of that quality out for a 180 minutes," Morrison said.
"The surprise element will be gone. They know they're in a game."
Helsinki are eight points clear at the top of Veikkausliiga, the Finnish Premier Division, and have scored 37 goals in 16 games.
"That adds pressure on them because they know if they lose it's a horrendous result," Morrison added.
"They've dominated Finnish football for two or three decades. They're in the Champions League or Europa League every year, so they're under pressure and there'll be a lot of spotlight on them."
