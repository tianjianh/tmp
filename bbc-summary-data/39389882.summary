[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Inverness Caley Thistle dropped back to the bottom of the Premiership following their 13th draw of the season.

Kilmarnock skipper Kris Boyd drilled in the opening goal from the penalty spot after Jordan Jones was upended by a crude Brad McKay challenge.
Billy Mckay levelled with a smart shot on the turn before the break.
In a wide open second half, both goalkeepers were kept busy, with Owain Fon Williams at full stretch to deny Killie's Callum Roberts.
The Highlanders began the day above Hamilton on goal difference but Accies found a late goal to sink nine-man St Johnstone.
This was a 12th draw of the league campaign for Kilmarnock, who remain seventh - four points behind Partick Thistle, so perhaps the outcome was no surprise.
Inverness have not lost too many games since the turn of the year but wins remain rare.
This was exactly the type of game at home that they must start capitalising on, with games running out, but slackness proved costly.
Billy King lost possession cheaply, Jones surged into the box and a lunging McKay could not cope, bringing the winger to the ground for a clear penalty on 19 minutes.
Boyd thumped the ball directly into the corner.
However, the hosts have a reliable striker of their own and when David Raven's cross broke to Mckay and he swivelled to find the net off the inside of a post.
Mckay was unlucky late on with first time shot which Freddie Woodman saved well, with the visiting keeper also thwarting Greg Tansey and Larnell Cole with impressive stops.
It's another point but home manager Richie Foran really needs wins at this stage.
This point isn't a bad result for the visitors, who have a margin of safety in the league.
The bright spark for them was Jones. He was direct when given the opportunity with pace that had McKay all at sea in the first half.
The winger followed McKay from right-back to left-back when he switched, with the defender replaced at half time after a torrid 45 minutes.
Jones also produced a few quality deliveries, one of which Boyd really ought to have smashed home but the experienced striker mishit his volley in front of goal.
He was also unlucky from close range with a shot that was creeping inside the post but Fon Williams did enough.
Kilmarnock claimed penalty when Gary Warren challenged Boyd on the edge of the box but the defender appeared to get a nick on the ball.
The visitors finished the stronger side and Greg Kiltie and Callum Roberts were also denied by good Fon Williams saves.
Lee McCulloch's side is operating very effectively. They look solid and remain in touch with a top six place and six points away from the relegation play-off spot.
Inverness CT manager Richie Foran: "We were the better team for most of the game. Over the match, probably their keeper is man of the match.

"I'm delighted with the players' attitude, passion, endeavour. We just lacked that wee bit of composure, a bit of quality in the final third.
"We wanted to win the game today. It brings us a point closer to Ross County but it's a disappointing result for us.
"If the lads were hiding from the ball I'd be worried but I'm not worried at all. I know we'll get a run going. The winning run is coming."
Kilmarnock interim manager Lee McCulloch: "They've beaten Rangers up here. It's a tough place to come. A point is a fair result.
"We finished the game with seven teenagers, so it just shows the character we've got in the dressing room.
"We could've nicked it in the end. Overall, Inverness had the bulk of possession but, possibly, we had the better chances.
"It's another week towards safety. The next two games are massive - Rangers at home, Celtic away. We thought it was important as a staff that we didn't get beat today."
