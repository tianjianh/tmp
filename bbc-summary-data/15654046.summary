The delicate bird shakes its head with such acceleration that it can reach a g-force of 34 (Formula 1 racing cars typically reach less than 6 g).
This mid-air manoeuvre takes just 0.1 seconds and removes almost all of the water droplets from its feathers.
The research is published in the journal of the Royal Society Interface.
