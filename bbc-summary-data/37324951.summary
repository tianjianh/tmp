[SN]TITLE[SN]
Barnsley 1-2 Reading

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Garath McCleary scored before being sent off as Reading beat Barnsley despite playing more than half the game with 10 men.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
McCleary saw his penalty saved by Adam Davies, after John Swift was brought down, before firing in the rebound.
Swift then curled in a second before McCleary was sent off for shoving Barnsley captain Conor Hourihane to the ground.
Adam Armstrong fired in a low shot for Barnsley late on but Reading held firm.
It was a disappointing result for the Tykes, who had thrashed Wolves 4-0 at Molineux on Tuesday.
Ryan Kent went close to putting them ahead when he struck the crossbar but it was the visitors who took the lead after Swift was brought down in the box by keeper Davies.
Davies did well to save the penalty but was unable to deny McCleary's follow-up attempt.
Following Swift's sublime finish to put Reading 2-0 up, McCleary was sent off for his reaction to a seemingly innocuous foul by Hourihane on Danny Williams.
But, despite having an extra man, Barnsley struggled to create clear chances, with only Armstrong being able to find the net.
Barnsley manager Paul Heckingbottom:
"We suffered through not getting the first goal today. Credit has to go to Reading, who played well. It was a good open game with chances at both ends, but going down 2-0 in this league is always going to make things difficult.
"We were given a lifeline in the sending-off and we will always fight right to the end and I'm glad the fans stuck with us right to the end. There's a brilliant bond between the players and the fans at the moment and the lads were given a great ovation at the end.
"We're enjoying every minute of life in this league. Big managers, big players on the pitch, big crowds, it's exactly what we want.
"We've got good players - good players who work their socks off - and we want to learn from today and get better and better with each game."
Reading boss Jaap Stam:
"In the first half we played very well. We had good possession, generated a number of chances and scored two good goals.
"We dominated with 11 men on the pitch, but obviously after Garath got sent off it was a totally different game. We decided to play a 4-4-1 system that allowed us to defend against Barnsley, who are a side with real quality.
"Sometimes maybe we got a bit lucky, but we worked very hard and didn't give many clear-cut chances away.
"Of course, Garath knows what he's done and does feel guilty because he was playing a fantastic game until then, but I think you have to question whether something like that can't just see a yellow card given.
"We are building a certain team with a certain style of play and defending is definitely an aspect of that. We made it very difficult for the attacking team today."
