[SN]TITLE[SN]
Falkirk 1-0 Raith Rovers

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Falkirk climbed within nine points of Scottish Championship leaders Hibernian with a deserved win over Raith Rovers.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Striker Lee Miller came off the bench to score a late winner for the Bairns, who leapfrog Morton into second place.
The goal was no more than Falkirk's play merited, having long bombarded Rovers goalkeeper Pavol Penska.
The Fife side drop to eighth, two points clear of the relegation play-off spot, and have won only two league matches since October.
Penska made impressive saves to deny Lewis Kidd and John Baird in the first half, as the Bairns started brightly.
Bob McHugh had the ball in the net after neat play from Luke Leahy and Craig Sibbald, but the striker was flagged offside.
The hosts' dominance continued after the break, and Slovakian stopper Penska did brilliantly to prevent what looked like a certain own goal, before McHugh rattled his crossbar with a shot on the turn.
Replacement Miller finally broke Rovers' resistance 19 minutes from time, when he was left unmarked to guide home a sweeping cross from fellow substitute James Craigen - the veteran's ninth goal of the season.
Once the Bairns had hit the front, there was little prospect of the Kirkcaldy club rescuing a point. No Rovers striker has scored an away goal in the Championship since October.
To add insult to injury, Lewis Vaughan, the Raith forward on loan at Dumbarton, scored the winner for their relegation rivals against Morton, moving the Sons above them in the table, although that deal was done before John Hughes replaced Gary Locke as manager.
Falkirk manager Peter Houston: "We finished second last year but we didn't deal well with the play-off final second leg against Kilmarnock, or we might already be in the top league, but I have no doubt we will have learned from that.
"The players, backroom staff and myself will know how to go about it if we get in that position again and handle it better.
"We certainly know what is at stake and we are in a good position now, but there's lots to play for as we go to Tannadice next weekend, so we won't take anything for granted."
Raith Rovers manager John Hughes: "To me, Lewis (Vaughan) is one of the best players at the club and he should never have gone on loan.
"But we just have to get on with it, even if I'm going to strangle him when he comes into training on Monday.
"He is a professional who is doing his job for Dumbarton, that is his club at this moment, even though it's come back to bite us on the backside. We have to look after ourselves."
