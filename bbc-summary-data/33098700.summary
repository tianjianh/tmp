[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Former Labour minister John Healey has pulled out of the race to be the party's next deputy leader.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Mr Healey said he had 20 nominations from fellow Labour MPs - not far short of the 35 needed to get on the ballot.
The Wentworth and Dearne MP told LabourList he wanted to give other candidates, from different wings of the party, a chance.
Mr Healey was a Treasury minister under Gordon Brown and has backed Yvette Cooper for the party leadership.
Tom Watson and Caroline Flint both have enough nominations to get on the deputy leadership ballot.
Explaining his decision, Mr Healey said: "I joined the contest for deputy leader to talk about the deeper thinking Labour must now do, and the big challenges we must face. I'll continue to do this as part of Labour's team as we rethink and rebuild to win in 2020.
"I really appreciate the strong support from those MPs who've nominated me. We know the mountain Labour must now climb to convince people that we're ready again to lead the country."
