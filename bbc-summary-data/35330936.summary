After a goalless first half, Bird picked up a loose ball just before the hour and shot beyond Callum Preston to put the Glovers ahead.
West Bromwich Albion loanee Campbell showed top-flight class when he curled in his first league goal from 25 yards.
Lee Barnard punished Yeovil's defensive hesitation for a late consolation.
Francois Zoko and Shaun Jeffers both missed chances, making the afternoon more nervy for the hosts, who consigned Crawley to a fifth consecutive away defeat.
Crawley Town boss Mark Yates told BBC Surrey:

"Very disappointing. We changed our formation to be more solid and still have a threat, and it didn't work and we weren't as good with the ball as we would have wanted.
"We looked like we played extra-time like they did on Tuesday night and you have to give them credit.
"We shot ourselves in the foot with the goals we conceded.
"With Yeovil fighting for their lives we must look at them and do the same. We don't want to get dragged into it but you've got to know coming to places like this you've got to roll your sleeves up."
