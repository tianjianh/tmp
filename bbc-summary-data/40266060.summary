Ipswich Hospital admits baby death Caesarean delay

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A hospital has admitted a breach of duty following the death of a newborn baby as a result of delays to his mother having a Caesarean.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
James Rawlings, born at Ipswich Hospital, was just 18 days old when he died at home in May last year.
An inquest in Ipswich heard that despite the concerns of a midwife and the mother Jo Rawlings, Dr Lovelina Das delayed a Caesarean delivery.
The hearing was told that Dr Das no longer worked at the hospital.
The hospital trust said it had been unable to contact Dr Das, who is believed to be working abroad.
The trust admitted that if James had been delivered earlier, he would probably have survived.
Mrs Rawlings praised the midwife for her support.
Greater Suffolk coroner Peter Dean concluded that James died from a lack of oxygen and sepsis.
"The evidence shows that had James been delivered earlier he would not have died on May 16," said Dr Dean
Mr and Mrs Rawlings now have a new eight-week-old son called Joshua.
