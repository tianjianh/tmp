The developers behind Belfast's Titanic Quarter are to restructure the business "following a review of costs."

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The chief executive of Titanic Quarter Limited, David Gavaghan, is to leave his post, along with two other senior figures.
But the company - owned by Dublin-based Harcourt Developments - says it remains committed to Northern Ireland.
Its owner Pat Doherty said the "cost base was not proportionate to the business".
The company was behind the construction of the Â£97m Titanic Belfast visitor attraction, as well as other waterfront projects.
In a statement, Titanic Quarter said 13 staff would remain "to progress major developments, including projects in the film production, hotel and office sectors".
It added: "We are dedicated to ensuring that Titanic Quarter Limited remains a key driver for Northern Ireland's economy."
Mr Doherty said: "David Gavaghan and two other senior personnel have made a valuable contribution to growth at Titanic Quarter and we wish them well for the future.
"In particular I would like to thank David for his leadership and wish him every success."
