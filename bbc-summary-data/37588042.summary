In October 2015, the BBC lifted the lid on "Victorian" working practices and conditions at the headquarters of retailer Sports Direct.
The findings were revealed after a two-year investigation into the site at Shirebrook, Derbyshire, which found dozens of ambulances had been called out and workers were "too scared" to take sick leave over fears they would lose their jobs.
The company's billionaire owner, Mike Ashley, was later summoned to appear before the Business, Innovations and Skills Committee, where he admitted workers were paid below the minimum wage.
He later promised a raft of changes.
But how much has actually improved? BBC Inside Out East Midlands producer Sarah Sturdey has been back to the warehouse to take a look.
