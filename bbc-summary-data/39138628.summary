At a meeting on Thursday, Conwy council also agreed to support the Colwyn Victoria Pier Trust (CVPT) in their bid to restore the pier back to its original 1900 glory.
The trust want to recreate the 1930s Art Deco pavilion, develop a new learning centre and install kiosks.
The Grade II-listed structure partially collapsed into the sea on 1 February.
It suffered more damage during Storm Doris, and demolition of its damaged sections began yesterday.
The authority has also applied for permission to salvage heritage elements of the building for potential use in its restoration.
The "truncated boardwalk" will be equivalent in floor plan to the existing front pavilion, and will reuse existing refurbished steelwork together with restored balustrades.
A report stated it would be paid for by the Â£106,000 set aside every year for the pier's management. The current demolition works will cost Â£650,000.
In a statement on their website, the trust said: "CVPT's consistent vision for Victoria Pier is to restore it to its former glory at the heart of the bay as a viable and sustainable mixed use facility for local people and visitors to enjoy which is run as a social enterprise that can contribute to the regeneration of the town."
The Heritage Lottery Fund said the trust should enlist the support of the council before applying for any funding.
In 2013, Conwy council voted to demolish the structure and a report at the time said restoring the pier would cost more than Â£15m.
Demolition was refused by the Welsh Government in 2015.
The 113-year-old pier has been closed since 2008 and its condition has been deteriorating since.
