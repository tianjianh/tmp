[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The arrested man and the victim, Murrey Paulson, were both found in Meynell Street in Derby on Wednesday morning.
The suspect, who is also 52, is in hospital under police guard due to a serious throat injury and will be questioned later.
Mr Paulson's family described him as a "genuinely lovely" man.
In a statement, they said: "He was always happy, smiling and we all loved him very, very much.
"Murrey was a genuinely lovely person who helped anyone he could."
Police found Mr Paulson after originally being called to reports of a man being injured to his throat further down the street.
They believe the two men knew each other.
The murder investigation is focusing on the last hours of Mr Paulson's life.
Det Ch Insp Gareth Meadows said: "The inquiry is now focussed on trying to find people who last saw Murrey alive."
He said police were particularly interested in speaking to anyone who saw him late on Tuesday afternoon, through to 08:00 BST on Wednesday.
