Wages were due to be paid on 28 October but owner Diego Lemos said last week that "unexpected cash flow problems" had prevented that happening.
"All wages have now been paid and once again I apologise to every member of staff for the delay in payment," Lemos told the club website.
Shrimps' Tom Barkhuizen, meanwhile, has mutually agreed to cancel his deal.
The 23-year-old forward joined in 2015 from Blackpool and Morecambe have stated they retain the right to compensation for the player.
Shrimps boss Jim Bentley had told BBC Radio Lancashire one option they had considered was selling a player to raise funds, while the Professional Footballers' Association had been deal with the wages situation.
Brazilian businessman Lemos bought the Shrimps on 1 September, taking over from Peter McGuigan.
