Samia Shahid: 'Honour killing' ex-husband refused bail

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The ex-husband of an alleged "honour killing" victim has been refused bail by a Pakistani court.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Samia Shahid, 28, from Bradford, died while visiting relatives in the country in July.
Her first husband Chaudhry Muhammad Shakeel is accused of her murder. The court in Jhelum indicated a higher court could yet hear his bail request.
Meanwhile, Ms Shahid's second husband, Syed Mukhtar Kazam, wants the case moved.
The High Court in Lahore is due to hear his application, which claims Ms Shahid's family has made threats to his life.
Lawyers for Mr Shakeel have not said if he now intends to make an application to the Punjab High Court.
Beautician Ms Shahid married Mr Kazam in Leeds in 2014 and the couple moved to Dubai.
Mr Kazam claimed his wife was killed because her family disapproved of their marriage.
Initially it was said she had died of a heart attack, but a post-mortem examination found she had been strangled.
Her father, Chaudhry Muhammad Shahid, has been held as a suspected accessory and released on bail.
