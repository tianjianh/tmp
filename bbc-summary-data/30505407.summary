Susan Potts given hospital order over mother's death

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A woman who caused the death of her elderly mother has been given an indefinite hospital order.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Susan Potts, 64, of Lodge Close, Uxbridge, Middlesex, had pleaded guilty to manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility.
Potts was arrested after Gladys Allen, 93, was found dead at a house in Crimicar Lane, Sheffield, last January.
Her family said they were "grateful" the justice system had recognised the defendant's mental state.
A post-mortem examination of Mrs Allen's body had proved inconclusive, South Yorkshire Police said.
However, Sheffield Crown Court was told her body had a range of injuries. including head wounds and broken ribs.
The Potts family said Mrs Allen had been the central focus of the family and Potts had been a "loving daughter who was consumed by remorse".
The statement continued: "The tragedy that occurred in January was because at that time Sue had become severely depressed; it would have been unthinkable in any other circumstances.
"We are grateful that the justice system has recognised, that, but for her mental state, this tragedy would not have occurred, and that Sue will continue to receive treatment in hospital.
"The hope for all of us, including Gladys' friends and neighbours, is that with expert care, Sue will recover and eventually return to her family."
