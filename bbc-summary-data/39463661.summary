[SN]TITLE[SN]
Wycombe Wanderers 3-3 Cheltenham Town

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Wycombe's slim League Two play-off hopes were dampened after drawing 3-3 against 10-man Cheltenham to drop to 11th in the table.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Two goals in six minutes from Billy Waters and Harry Pell gave the Robins an unlikely lead before a Garry Thompson double levelled things.
Cheltenham's Jordan Cranston was sent off on 40 minutes and Wycombe thought they had won it when Joe Jacobson scored a late penalty.
But Waters fired in the rebound after missing a spot-kick of his own soon after to give struggling Cheltenham a crucial point.
Cheltenham were in front after just seven minutes when Waters tapped in Jamal Blackman's fumble for his 13th goal of the season.
Pell's side-footed finish from James Rowe's cross made it 2-0 shortly after, before Thompson pulled one back on 21 minutes with a neat flick.
Cranston's challenge on Matt Bloomfield saw him receive his second yellow card in quick succession and Thompson volleyed home from a tight angle to level before the break.
Jacobson's 81st-minute penalty, after Thompson was fouled, looked to have given Wycombe all three points.
But when Danny Wright was felled in the box by Michael Harriman at the other end, Waters saw his spot-kick saved but turned in the rebound to earn Cheltenham a draw.
