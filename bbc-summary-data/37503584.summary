Nama defends itself from criticisms over sale of Project Eagle

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Republic's bad bank, Nama, has again defended itself from criticisms over the sale of its NI property portfolio, known as Project Eagle.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Seamus McCarthy, the Comptroller and Auditor General, said Nama could have got £190m more for the sale of Project Eagle than it did.
Nama contested that, saying it received the market price for Project Eagle.
The Northern Ireland property folio that Nama inherited was once valued at about £4.5bn.
Nama sold it two years ago for about £1.3bn and has always vigorously contested the £190m finding describing it as a desktop finding without any market or expertise input.
Mr McCarthy - whose job is to make sure the Irish taxpayer gets value for money from public spending - said that the difference between the role of the sale advisers in this deal compared to others by Nama "was enormous".
But he told the Dail's Public Accounts Committee (PAC) that the probable loss was not set in stone, saying he did not have a crystal ball and does not know if a better price could have been achieved.
In his report earlier this month, the comptroller also said Nama was slow to act once it became aware that Frank Cushnahan, the bad bank's former Northern adviser, was due to receive a payment from the sale.
Mr McCarthy repeated that criticism on Thursday.
When they appeared before the PAC this time last year, senior Nama officials said Frank Cushnahan had no inside knowledge, and that was reiterated again on Thursday.
Nama's chairman, Frank Daly, said Mr Cushnahan may have presented himself in Northern Ireland as a Nama insider but that he was "peripheral".
And on whether the sale should have been stopped once Nama became aware that Mr Cushnahan was to receive a fee, Mr Daly said their judgement then and now was that the sale and interest of the Irish taxpayer "took precedence" over "alleged misbehaviour".
Earlier this month, the BBC Spotlight programme appeared to show Mr Cushnahan had accepted £40,000 in cash from a developer.
Mr Cushnahan was working as an advisor for Nama at the time. He has denied any wrongdoing.
On Thursday, Nama officials said that if they had known then what they know now, they would have terminated his contract regardless of "whatever inter-governmental difficulties" may have arisen.
On the programme itself, Nama said that property valuations that were allegedly the bad bank's were not - and were in fact significantly lower, in one in case by 80%.
Today's Public Accounts Committee session had all the hallmarks of a second round in a fight between two state bodies.
The Nama deal is already the subject of an inquiry by the Northern Ireland Assembly's finance committee.
The Irish government has announced it intends to set up an investigation into NI's biggest ever property deal.
