Dr Dre's third album, the soundtrack to N.W.A. biopic Straight Outta Compton, follows his last release, called 2001.
Singer-songwriter Charlie Puth tops the UK singles chart with his song Marvin Gaye, featuring Meghan Trainor - giving each artist their second chart-topper.
One Direction track Drag Me Down falls from the top spot to number nine after its second week on release.
The song broke streaming records last week, earning the highest first-week streams for a single in the UK with more than two million plays.
Marvin Gaye has climbed a massive 89 places following its full download release, after reaching 90 last week on streams alone.
"UK - thank you so much for making Marvin Gaye number one," Puth told The Official Charts Company. "I can't wait to spend a lot more time making friends in the UK."
Puth previously reached number one in April with See You Again, the song he and Wiz Khalifa contributed to the soundtrack of Fast & Furious 7.
