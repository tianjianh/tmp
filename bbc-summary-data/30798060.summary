Jonathan Trott hits first England century in 18 months

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Jonathan Trott has hit his first century in international cricket since leaving the 2013-2014 Ashes series with a "stress-related illness".

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Trott, 33, was unbeaten on 176 at stumps on the third day against South Africa A in Paarl.
It continued the skipper's good form after he hit 79 from 127 balls in the opening tour match.
The batsman's century took the Lions to 507-6 in response to South Africa's first innings 504-8 declared.
James Vince and Adil Rashid both hit 78 as the Lions recovered well from being reduced to 67-3.
The four-day match is the first unofficial Test of England Lions' tour.
Trott's last three-figure score for England was an unbeaten 109 against New Zealand in a one-day international in June 2013.
