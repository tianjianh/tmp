Wales international Taylor suffered the injury in training on Wednesday.
Swansea boss Paul Clement said he is looking to agree terms over signing Sweden's Olsson.
"The two clubs are talking about that possibility. The stage it's at is we're looking to agree the terms," he said.
Clement said Taylor is "probably" facing three weeks of non-contact.
"He'll have to be fitted out with a face mask," added the Swans manager.
Taylor was taken to hospital and will have an operation.
Meanwhile, winger Modou Barrow came off injured in the 28th minute of Swansea's 2-1 EFL Trophy last 16 win against Wolves on Tuesday.
