[SN]TITLE[SN]
Bolton Wanderers 2-0 Oldham Athletic

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Zach Clough's first goals since 23 April earned high-flying Bolton a League One derby win to keep Oldham rooted in the bottom four.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Clough curled in a stunning free-kick from 18 yards after 10 minutes following Paul Green's foul on Sammy Ameobi.
And he secured Wanderers' first-ever win over their neighbours at the Macron Stadium 13 minutes from time after Carl Winchester cleared Ameobi's first effort off the line.
Phil Parkinson's side, who have now won their last three games without conceding a goal, were good value for the three points.
Ameobi wasted a first-half one-on-one with Connor Ripley while the Latics keeper saved brilliantly to turn away a David Wheater header.
Steve Robinson's visitors played their part in a lively first league meeting in 19 years and Mark Howard smartly turned aside Lee Erwin's 34th-minute effort.
Lively Winchester flashed a hat-trick of shots over the crossbar in 18 second-half minutes while Howard made a decisive block after Green beat the offside trap.
But it was Clough's finishing skills that prevailed to keep Wanderers firmly in the play-off places.
