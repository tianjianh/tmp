The 20-year-old, who can play as a winger or striker, has signed a three-year contract at the Madejski Stadium.
"He has a great left foot, good technique, good physique, pace - all together he is a promising young player," Royals boss Jaap Stam told the club website.
"We are hopeful he can be a good player for us going forward."
Paris-born Meite has played for the Ivory Coast at Under-17 level, and has been allocated Reading's number 19 shirt for the coming season.
