What is a young carer?

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A young carer is someone who has to look after parents or siblings who struggle to care for themselves because of illness.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Tens of thousands of children in the UK care for an adult in their life.
28 January is Young Carers Awareness Day so Newsround has been hearing from kids who care for relatives suffering from mental illness.
Many people don't realise the important and hard role young carers have, helping a parent or relative every day.
This can sometimes effect their normal life, and the extra responsibilities being a carer brings means many miss out on school, and free time with friends, to stay at home.
Often young carers do household jobs, such as cooking and cleaning, because their parent or guardian is too ill.
Charities like the Carer's Trust are worried that many young carers aren't getting enough support to help them cope.
If you are worried by any of these issues, you can find more info and advice on young carers here.
