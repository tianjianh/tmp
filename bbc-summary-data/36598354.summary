The 28-year-old was a regular for the managerless Latics last season, but was one of seven players to be let go by the League One club in May.
"Mike is someone we were interested in back in January," said Carlisle head of recruitment Lee Dykes.
"We know what we're getting, he knows the game and he knows how to win matches."
Jones previously played for Tranmere, Bury, Sheffield Wednesday and Crawley.
