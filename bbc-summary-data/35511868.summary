A Roman road has been uncovered during work to develop a car park at a fort along Hadrian's Wall.

Stonework and pottery fragments were also found at Housesteads, Haydon Bridge, Northumberland, where work was under way to extend the visitor centre facilities.
The importance and scale of the find is being assessed, a spokesman for Northumberland National Park said.
Discussions will then take place on how best to preserve it.
Chris Jones, historic environment officer for the park, said: "The discovery of new remains is always a great thrill for any archaeologist. With every day that passes, we will know more."
The road runs north-west to south-east and appears to be overlain by the B6318 Military Road.
The Military Road was constructed in the 1750s as General Wade's men fought Jacobite rebels.
