Jonathan Anderson - creative director of the JW Anderson and Loewe labels - has put together the Disobedient Bodies exhibition at the Hepworth Wakefield gallery.
He has placed fashion items next to sculptures to show how designers and artists have tackled the human body - and how art has influenced what we wear.
The exhibition, which opens on Saturday, includes designs by Anderson himself as well as Vivienne Westwood, Helmut Lang and Yves Saint Laurent, plus works by sculptors Alberto Giacometti, Sarah Lucas and Louise Bourgeois.
