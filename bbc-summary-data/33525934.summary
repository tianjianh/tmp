Mr Thwaites, 70, and his wife, 69, were among 30 British tourists killed in a gun attack  in Sousse on 26 June.
The Reverend David Phillips told mourners in Fairhaven, Lytham, the couple were "two lovely, beautiful and precious people."
Mr Thwaites played football for Birmingham City from 1962-1972.
Onlookers wiped away tears and embraced each other as the funeral cortege arrived at Fairhaven United Reformed Church, known locally as The White Church.
The congregation heard the couple, who made Blackpool their home for the past 35 years, had looked forward to their stay at the Hotel Riu Imperial Marhaba.
Mr Phillips told mourners everyone had been "acutely aware of our helplessness" towards the "terrible thing that has happened".
He added: "Hearts have been broken, lives have been deeply scarred.
"Two lovely, beautiful and precious people have had their lives taken from them, without cause, and with a violence that was wholly undeserved.
"What was done was an ugly, brutal and inexcusable crime."
Mr Thwaites' elder sister Sandra said that it was through her brother's talent as a footballer "that his life and the life of the whole family would be changed and shaped forever".
Stockton-born Mr Thwaites was part of the Birmingham City squad that won the 1963 League Cup before he retired from football at the age of 27. He later moved with his family to Blackpool, where he worked as a hospital porter.
Former Birmingham players Malcolm Page. Alan Campbell, Malcolm Beard, Colin Green and Brian Sharples attended the funeral service.
Mr Page, 68, said: "His loyalty and great skill as a footballer were the two great things I will remember."
The funeral was followed by a private family service.
