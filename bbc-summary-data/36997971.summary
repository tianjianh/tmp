Scottish League Two: Edinburgh City begin life in senior league with loss

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Annan Athletic, Forfar Athletic, Clyde and Elgin City all started their Scottish League Two campaigns with single goal victories.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Promoted Edinburgh City started with a 3-2 loss at home to Forfar, and Annan beat Stirling Albion by the same score line.
Barry Ferguson's Clyde edged out Montrose 2-1, and Elgin City were 1-0 winners away to Cowdenbeath.
Arbroath were held at home by Berwick Rangers in a 1-1 draw at Gayfield.
Edinburgh City got off to the worst possible start as David Cox scored a penalty, but Craig Beattie levelled.
However, the joy was short-lived as Lewis Milne made it two. Thomas O'Brien added another late on before Ross Guthrie's consolation strike, while Joe Mbu and Cox both saw red after the final whistle.
Annan had to come from behind after Sean Dickson put the visitors ahead, with Ross Forsyth diverting a cross into his own net then David McKenna and Aidan Smith made it three, before Marc McKenzie pulled one back.
Matt Flynn's first goal for Clyde gave his side a first win of the season, adding to Dylan Easton's opener after Chris Templeman had levelled with a header.
Chris McLeish scored the only goal of the game as Elgin City started with a win, slotting into the bottom corner with his left foot just after the break.
Arbroath deservedly took the lead against Berwick when midfielder Martin Scott drove a left-foot strike into the top-right corner, but the visitors fought back through a Steven Thomson equaliser.
