[SN]TITLE[SN]
Police 'restraint' in Manchester cell to be investigated by watchdog

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The "use of force" by police officers on a man during his detention is to be investigated by the police watchdog.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Neville Edwards, 31, said he was elbowed and punched when restrained at Manchester's Longsight Police Station.
He posted footage of the police cell incident online after being convicted of assaulting a police officer.
The Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) will examine whether the force used was "proportionate".
The matter came to light after Edwards was found guilty at Manchester Crown Court on 14 January of causing actual bodily harm.
Footage of the incident was provided as evidence in court.
Edwards said he was "compliant" with the conditions at the time of the arrest in July 2015.
The IPCC received a voluntary referral from Greater Manchester Police (GMP) on 28 January.
GMP has previously said officers were "required to use force to restrain the individual and remove his clothing for his own safety".
Greater Manchester interim mayor and Police and Crime Commissioner Tony Lloyd said: "I welcome that GMP has voluntarily referred this case and that the IPCC has agreed to investigate it.
"I hope this investigation is both thorough and speedy so we can get to the bottom of what happened and instil public confidence in this process."
Edwards is due to be sentenced on 10 March.
