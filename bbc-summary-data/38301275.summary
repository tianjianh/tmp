A man who carried out an armed robbery at an Aberdeen shop is being sought by police.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The incident happened at Icon Stores on George Street at about 22:00 on Saturday.
The man escaped with a three-figure sum of money. The type of weapon involved has not been specified.
Police said the culprit was described as being in his 30s, about 5ft 6in tall, and of slim build. He was wearing a black tracksuit top and dark jeans.
Det Sgt Stephen Beattie said: "Fortunately no one was injured during the incident, however the member of staff who was working at the time was left understandably shaken.
"This is the second incident reported to police in recent weeks involving the same premises, which is an obvious concern.
"I would like to take this opportunity to reassure local people and the wider public that officers are doing everything possible to trace the individual involved, and that extensive inquiries are ongoing."
A 15-year-old male was charged in connection with the earlier incident.
