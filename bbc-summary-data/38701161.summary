Guiseley 2-1 Sutton United

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Sutton warmed up for Monday's FA Cup clash with Arsenal with a last-gasp defeat at struggling Guiseley.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Paul Doswell's men may have had one eye on next week's mouth-watering clash with the Premier League giants but they are now just four points better off than their opponents, who moved out of the relegation zone following the win.
Guiseley took an early lead when Jake Cassidy headed home a Kevan Hurst corner.
Derek Asamoah came close to a second for the home side, firing straight at goalkeeper Ross Worner, but Sutton were level before the break when Matt Tubbs slotted home from the penalty spot.
Cassidy saw another shot and then a firm header held by Worner but the Lions got the goal their pressure deserved in the third minute of time added on as John Rooney stabbed in a low cross from Marcus Williams.
