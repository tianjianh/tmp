Bristol libraries opening hours to be cut

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Library opening hours in Bristol are being cut by just under a quarter.

The move comes after Bristol City Council said it needed to look at a range of options to save Â£1.1m from its 2016-17 library budget.
Earlier this year more than 5,000 people completed a survey to help shape the future of the service.
The city council said changes were based on current usage and public feedback and would come into force in April 2016.
Originally seven libraries were threatened with closure, but following a number of protests elected mayor George Ferguson said he would look again at the proposals.
People were asked to choose between two different ways of distributing the opening hours throughout the week and questioned whether they wanted the libraries to be open at the weekend.
The council said there was an "overwhelming desire" for branch libraries to be open on Saturday, but added only the Central Library would be open on a Sunday.
Assistant mayor, councillor Daniella Radice, said people were looking for consistency and a simpler pattern of opening hours, "and we've tried to reflect that in our decisions".
"There is great potential to extend access to the buildings and the service through a number of different ways, and we are keen to work with volunteers, organisations and communities who wish to try this."
