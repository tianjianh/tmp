Forest Green Rovers 1-1 Sutton United

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Matt Tubbs' first goal for Forest Green Rovers was not enough to clinch a first victory of the season after a 1-1 draw with Sutton.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The hosts could not have got off to a better start when Tubbs headed home a free-kick by Mohamed Chemlal after just seven minutes.
Forest Green pushed for a second with Chemlal looking the man most likely to add to the score.
But Sutton scored an equaliser when Nick Bailey struck from the spot after Drissa Traore brought down Bedsente Gomis in the area.
