Work by 30 artists is being shown in six locations under the heading Harmonious Society as part of the city's third Asia Triennial.
Curator Jiang Jiehong, professor of Chinese art at Birmingham City University, explains how the country's new generation of artists are dealing with politics with a sense of humour.
Asia Triennial Manchester runs until 23 November.
