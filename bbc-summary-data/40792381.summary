Super League: Huddersfield Giants 36-6 Wakefield Trinity

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Huddersfield Giants began their Super 8s campaign with a convincing six-try victory over Wakefield to move up to seventh in the table.

Danny Brough was instrumental for the Giants, scoring 10 of their first-half points, including the opening try.
The stand-off converted Darnell McIntosh and Ryan Hinchcliffe tries and landed a penalty before Sam Williams responded to make it 18-6 at the break.
Jermaine McGillvary, Leroy Cudjoe and Daniel Smith tries completed the win.
A fine run of six wins in their past eight Super League games had helped Huddersfield claim a top-eight finish, giving them a shot of returning to the play-offs.
Their victory, combined with Wigan's defeat by Leeds, sees them move up one place and to within four points of the top four with six Super 8s matches remaining.
Brough's kicking game ensured Huddersfield got off to an ideal start, with a grubber through mishandled by Wakefield's defence in-goal to allow him to cross for the first points of the night.
After the break Cudjoe was a damaging presence, storming through for the hosts' fourth try before playing a part in their final score from Smith.
Huddersfield head coach Rick Stone told BBC Radio Leeds:
"I think the opposition helped us a few times and made a few errors, but overall our consistency in both halves was good.
"We scored 18-6 in the first-half and close to 18-0 in the second-half so that gives us some confidence and it continues the momentum going forward.
"We just stuck at it for 80 minutes, we competed hard for 80 minutes and we know that's what we have to do to be competitive in the Super 8s."
Wakefield head coach Chris Chester told BBC Radio Leeds:
"We were very poor, I'm very disappointed, I'm embarrassed.
"I'm really disappointed for the people that have tuned up tonight and paid money to watch that.
"I've seen some things tonight that I've not seen in a heck of a long time, and I would expect my under-19s or my under-16s to make those kinds of errors."
