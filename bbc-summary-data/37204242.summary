Ian Bell struck an unbeaten 94 to boost hopes of an England return and help Warwickshire post 284-4.
Somerset's reply was blighted by Patel (5-42), whose five lbws included the key wicket of Peter Trego (58).
James Hildreth (44) and Ryan Davies (46) rallied but the Bears held firm to book their place at Lord's.
Warwickshire will now face the Brown Caps, who beat Yorkshire in Sunday's semi-final, on Saturday, 17 September.
The Bears' victory over Somerset was built on the foundations set by openers Jonathan Trott and Sam Hain, who shared 90 before the former was caught and bowled by Roelof van der Merwe for 44.
Hain (86) then put on a further 88 with Bell, whose flurry of late attacking strokes, including two straight sixes off Van der Merwe, took the hosts to a competitive total.
Somerset lost regular wickets throughout their chase, with eight batsmen reaching double figures but just one - Trego - going on to make a half-century.
Only the heroics of number 10 batsman Tim Groenewald prevented the home side's victory from being more emphatic, clubbing an unbeaten 30 off 20 deliveries to take the match to the final over.
But a series of well-directed yorkers from Oliver Hannon-Dalby (2-41) ensured Warwickshire would reach the final of the competition they last won in 2010, leaving Somerset on 276-9.
Warwickshire director of cricket Dougie Brown told BBC WM:
"We posted a very competitive total which we thought was going to be a really challenging ask. It is testament to the way Somerset play their cricket and how deep they bat that they made it so close.
"All credit to Jeetan Patel who built the pressure which created the opportunities that earned his wickets.
"Then the way Chris Wright and Olly Hannon-Dalby bowled under pressure at the end was just outstanding. They held their nerve brilliantly well.
"Lord's finals are always really special occasions so it's great to have another one to look forward to. It will be a great day for everybody and I'm delighted for the supporters who have come out in such force to back us."
Somerset director of cricket Matthew Maynard:
"We thought 260, maybe 265, was a total we were looking at to chase but they had a really good over late on from Ian Bell.
"It is only the second game we have lost all through in the competition. It's just a shame it was the semi-final.
"We suffered a couple of decisions that didn't go our way but sometimes you get that.
"It is hard when you get two in a game but when Trego and Abell got that partnership together we just needed that to kick on probably another eight overs or so."
