The error affected a number of international flights leaving the terminal on Wednesday, with some airlines urging passengers to travel only with hand luggage.
Virgin Atlantic said all airlines flying out of the terminal had been affected.
Passengers have been warned it may be days before they are reunited with luggage.
An airport spokesperson apologised and said the fault had now been fixed.
Virgin Atlantic said it would ensure all bags were sent out as soon as possible.
It added customers should retain receipts for anything they had bought and make a claim to be reimbursed.
Passengers, who were informed by e-mail of the problem, took to social media to vent their frustrations.
One branded the situation "ludicrous" and said he was only told 12 hours before his flight.
The airport said it could not confirm what the problem was, what had caused it or how many people had been affected.
A number of major international carriers including British Airways, American Airlines and Emirates operate flights from Terminal 3.
