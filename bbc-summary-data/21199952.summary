The number of operations to deal with 'man boobs' has fallen by a fifth in the past year in the UK, data on cosmetic surgery suggests.

Meanwhile women had more procedures to inject fat than to remove it for the first time.
Eye lid surgery as well as face and neck-lift operations both soared in popularity in both sexes in 2012.
The British Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons (BAAPS) said overall the number of procedures was stable.
There were 43,172 surgical procedures carried out by the BAAPS 230 surgeons last year.
There were 642 operations on moobs - man boobs - down 18% from 2011. Surgeons speculated that more people were heading back to the gym instead.
Breast augmentation was again the most common procedure in the UK with 9,843 going under the knife. That was a fall of 1.6% on the previous year, which was put down to the health scare around PIP breast implants.
There were concerns about the implants rupturing and leaking non-medical grade silicone into the body.
Fat transfers which take fat from one part of the body to inject into another, often the face, increased by 13%.
It was one of a suite of anti-ageing procedures which increased in popularity among men and women in the past year. Facelifts went up by 14%, brow lifts by 17% and eyelid surgery by 13%.
However, liposuction and tummy tucks both fell by more than 10% in men and women.
The president of BAAPS and consultant plastic surgeon, Rajiv Grover, said: "The growth rates for surgical facelifting and other anti-ageing procedures showed a double digit rise, despite a double dip recession.
"Whilst there is an undeniable rise in demand for non-surgical treatments of the face, for example Botox and fillers, once there is actual loose skin in the neck or jowling, only surgery is likely to make a significant improvement and the public seem to be increasingly aware of this.
"The considerable drop in body-shaping procedures such as liposuction and tummy tucks may well be due to people choosing to head back to the gym, perhaps inspired by an unforgettable summer of Olympic golds!"
