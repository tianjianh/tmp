It will be constructed on a site between Alloway Road and Lochside Road in the north west of the town.
The project forms part of the wider Dumfries learning town project and should be completed by spring 2018.
Dumfries and Galloway Council's education committee chairman Jeff Leaver said it would become a real focal point for the community.
The complex will accommodate secondary, primary and nursery pupils as well as children with additional support needs.
Community facilities including a library will also be built at the site.
"This is not just a school we are building, it is a campus," said Mr Leaver.
"It is a massive complex and we are committed to spending about £34m on this - it is a very, very major investment in north west Dumfries."
Mr Leaver said the development would tackle issues with current provision in the area.
"One of the problems with the current Maxwelltown High School is it is on the very periphery of Lochside," he said.
"This will be much more central and it is estimated something like 80% of pupils will be located within a kilometre of the school.
"It will be very, very central - not only for the pupils but for the community in general."
