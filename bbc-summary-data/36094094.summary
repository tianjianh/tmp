A swan that was shot with an arrow in Fife has made a full recovery and has been released.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The bird along with its dead mate was discovered at Wemyss Estate off Standing Stane Road in Kirkcaldy on Saturday 19 March.
The swan had been shot through the wing with an arrow which narrowly missed its vital organs and spine.
It underwent emergency surgery and was on antibiotics and painkillers until its release on 13 April.
The swan was cared for at the Scottish SPCA's national wildlife rescue centre in Fishcross and was released at a protected site on the River Tay.
Manager Colin Seddon said: "Once her wounds were healing and she was feeding well she went on to a wet pool and once given the all clear by our vet she went outside into one of our swan paddocks where she was able to join another recuperating swan.
"Being a flock animal, swans do much better when kept with other swans.
"After a week outside and once the weather conditions were suitable, she was released along with her new companion at a privately owned nature reserve on the River Tay, where the wild swans are support fed until they choose to disperse and go their own way."
Insp Sarah Gregory, of the Scottish SPCA, said: "Sadly the swan's mate was found dead at the same time but we have recently received the results of a post-mortem which do not show anything linking the death to intentional trauma or a bow and arrow attack.
"Despite our public appeal following the cruel and mindless attack on the female swan, we have not yet traced the perpetrator and we would still urge anyone with information to come forward."
