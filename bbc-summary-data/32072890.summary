A £500,000 synthetic football pitch needs thousands of pounds worth of remedial action, less than 18 months after it was laid.

Newton Stewart Football Club's 3G pitch was funded by Dumfries and Galloway Council and Sportscotland.
However the "all-weather" surface has been dogged by flooding problems, which forced the cancellation one South of Scotland league game.
Councillors have been asked to approve almost £12,000 worth of drainage works.
In a report, Wigtown Area Committee has been told that there was just one incidence of standing water during its first 12 months, when the contractor which laid the surface was responsible for maintenance.
That agreement ended in October last year, leaving the local authority responsible for the upkeep of the pitch at Blairmount.
Within weeks, Newton Stewart FC cancelled a game due to a waterlogged pitch. It flooded again in February and March.
The report said the drainage system has been found to be at fault.
"It was clear from examination of all components that the problem lay in the carpet infill and the rate at which water was percolating through this," it added.
It asks councillors to approve a series of measures to rectify the problem.
