Claudy crash: Two police officers disciplined for 81mph speed in 30mph zone

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Two police officers have been disciplined for speeding during a pursuit in Claudy, County Londonderry.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
They were driving at 81mph through a 30mph zone in an unmarked police vehicle with no sirens or flashing lights in December 2011.
The officers were following a car that later crashed killing a woman passenger.
The Police Ombudsman found no causal link between the way the police car was driven and the woman's death.
The woman who died was 20-year-old Claire Kelly from Dungiven, County Londonderry.
The driver of the car in which Ms Kelly was a rear seat passenger pleaded guilty to a series of offences.
He pleaded guilty to dangerous driving and causing death by careless driving with excess alcohol.
He was jailed for three years and banned from driving for five years.
The accident happened on 11 December 2011 after officers noticed a Renault Clio perform a handbrake turn in the village of Feeny and drive off at speed in the direction of Claudy.
Police gave chase but the police driver said he quickly abandoned the pursuit given the speed at which the Clio was being driven.
He said he lost sight of it not far from Feeny.
CCTV footage examined by a Police Ombudsman investigator suggested there was a 12-second gap between the two cars just before the crash that happened on the outskirts of Claudy.
The driver of the Clio and another passenger, the boyfriend of the woman who died, provided statements to the Police Ombudsman's investigation.
The driver said he panicked and fled from police as he had been drinking and was uninsured.
He said he touched the brakes as he tried to negotiate a right-hand bend and felt the car "wiggle" before it crashed.
He told the investigator he had not heard sirens but at one stage saw blue flashing lights in the windscreen of the police car.
The driver of the police car, a trained advanced police driver and pursuit driver, denied any wrongdoing when interviewed by a Police Ombudsman investigator.
Although he admitted driving through Claudy at speed, without sirens or flashing lights, he said he had continually assessed the situation for any dangers.
Police guidelines require officers to inform the police control room when a car fails to stop and seek authority to pursue it.
He, and the other officer in the car, failed to inform the police control room about the pursuit.
The driver said the pursuit ended before they left Feeny. The other officer said they had not been in pursuit at any stage.
An examination of the unmarked police car also raised concerns that electronic equipment mounted in the vehicle could have impaired the driver's view and had the potential to cause serious injury if the vehicle's airbags were activated.
Video recording equipment within the police car was also found to have had two separate faults and no footage of the incident was recorded.
Police Ombudsman Dr Michael Maguire said that driving at 81mph in a 30mph zone could in some circumstances be justified, but pointed out that CCTV footage had shown there to be other cars and pedestrians in the area at the time.
He said: "In this case, it should have been obvious that driving at this speed, through a small built up town, without either emergency blue warning lights or sirens, in an unmarked black-coloured vehicle, at about 1.30am when drunken night revellers are likely to be nearby, would have been far below the standard of driving expected of a police officer."
