Despite a promising start by Exeter, Luton went in front on 11 minutes when Pierce Sweeney was adjudged to have fouled Hylton in the box and he stepped up to cheekily dink the resultant penalty over the diving Bobby Olejnik.
David Wheeler glanced a header wide and Robbie Simpson again went close as Exeter threatened an equaliser.
It finally came on 39 minutes when Ethan Ampadu's thumping long-range shot came back off the post and Reuben Reid tapped in the rebound.
Cameron McGeehan headed wide as Luton dominated the start of the second half and Luton went back in front in 72 minutes when a deep cross was bundled in at the back post by Glen Rea.
Pelly Ruddock was sent off after picking up his second yellow card and that led to an Exeter onslaught with Holmes firing high and Reid heading over.
But Luton wrapped it up when Troy Archibald-Henville was penalised for a foul on Craig Mackail-Smith on 86 minutes and Hylton scored his second spot kick to book the Hatters' place in round two.
