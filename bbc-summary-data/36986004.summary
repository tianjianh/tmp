As the red warning lights started flashing at the Oulton Broad crossing, the driver carried on across the railway line - narrowly missing the descending barriers.
The driver, who was caught on camera on Thursday, also nearly struck a woman pushing a buggy and another woman with a young child on the footpath.
Suffolk's Police and Crime Commissioner Tim Passmore described the driver's antics as "dangerous, reckless and completely unacceptable".
