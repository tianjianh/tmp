It happened close to Fanad Head lighthouse at 15:00 BST on Sunday.
The Irish Coast Guard received a 999 call reporting that a man had fallen into the water and they alerted a number of rescue services.
The man was recovered from the sea and received first aid at the scene. He was then airlifted to Letterkenny Hospital, but was later pronounced dead.
Ian Scott, station officer at Malin Head Coast Guard in County Donegal, said it was not yet clear what part of Northern Ireland the man was from.
Mr Scott said Irish Coast Guard staff made an emergency broadcast on receipt of the 999 call and a local boat that was in the area responded and went to the man's aid.
"We also tasked our coast guard helicopter from Sligo, both Lough Swilly lifeboats and also our fast response coast guard team from Mulroy."
The station officer added: "All the search and rescue units arrived on the scene and our coast guard team from Mulroy managed to recover the man from the water, they administered CPR (cardiopulmonary resuscitation).
"He was then transferred to the coast guard helicopter and flown to Letterkenny Hospital."
The man's name has not yet been released.
