Despite being relegated to Division Two of the County Championship, Worcestershire have announced a surplus after tax of £182,412 for the 12-month period ending 31 December, 2015.
This compares with a surplus after tax of £58,772 for the previous period.
"The year 2015 has again shown promise and progression," said Leatherdale.
"We have increased income across membership, tickets and events and we are starting to see the fruits of players being brought through the club's vibrant academy during the last five years, which will only continue.
"The club is in a very different and more positive place than five years ago and a great deal of progress has been made.
"However, there is still further work to do in what are potentially changing and unpredictable times for cricket, both domestically and globally."
Leatherdale, 48, is to leave his post in March to become chief executive at the Professional Cricketers' Association, ending a 30-year association with Worcestershire which began as a player.
T20 Blast quarter-finalists Worcestershire have made three overseas signings for the 2016 season.
New Zealand fast bowler Matt Henry will be present for the first half of the summer, prior to the arrival of South Africa pace bowler Kyle Abbott, while Kiwi all-rounder Mitchell Santner will play in the T20 Blast.
