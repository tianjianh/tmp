Melanie Hall, 25, was last seen leaving a nightclub in Bath in 1996. Her remains were found near the M5 in 2009.
Steve and Pat Hall hope the reward will yield "crucial" information.
Mr Hall said: "We believe we're in touching distance of a significant breakthrough and feel it's the right time to offer a substantial reward."
Mr Hall, Melanie's father, said he hopes "someone who knows a crucial piece of information" will have the "moral fibre" to contact the police.
"Melanie's murder has had a terrible impact on our family and I know my wife Pat is tortured by what happened to our daughter and will never get over it," he said.
"Someone may have been wavering over whether to provide information for a long time. This amount of money is life-changing and I hope it will provide the incentive for them to do the right thing."
Miss Hall, who worked at the Royal United Hospital in Bath, was last seen on a night out with friends at Cadillacs nightclub on 9 June 1996.
A black bin liner containing her bones and skull was found by a workman clearing vegetation next to a slip-road at junction 14 of the M5, near Thornbury, South Gloucestershire, on 5 October 2009.
Det Supt Andy Bevan, said forensic scientists were still in the process of developing a DNA profile from an item found near her remains
"There's no doubt this brings us an important step closer to finding her killer," he said.
"Someone out there has a very dark and terrible secret, which is getting closer to being revealed."
Nine people have been arrested in connection with the case since the investigation began, but no-one has been charged.
The reward is for information provided to the police which leads to the arrest and conviction of the person or people responsible for Ms Hall's murder.
