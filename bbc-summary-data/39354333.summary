Grant, 26, joined the club from Blackpool in July 2015 after a brief loan spell and has played in every League One game this season.
The midfielder has scored seven goals to help Uwe Rosler's promotion-chasing side reach third place and has been rewarded with a new deal until 2019.
"The manager was a massive part of the decision. I've really enjoyed the style that he wants to play," Grant said.
"I'm very happy to be a part of what we're creating here."
Grant began his career at Accrington Stanley before playing for Scunthorpe, Rochdale, Blackpool and on loan at Shrewsbury .
With eight matches left to play, Fleetwood, who have lost just one of their last 21 league matches, are four points off an automatic promotion place, occupied by rivals Bolton.
