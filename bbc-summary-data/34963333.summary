Mark Ellis: Carlisle United extend loan of Shrewsbury Town defender

Carlisle United have extended the loan of defender Mark Ellis from League One side Shrewsbury Town until 2 January.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Ellis, 27, signed on a one-month loan deal in October and has made six appearances so far for the Cumbrians.
"Mark has settled well here and he's a player who looks like he's enjoying his football," manager Keith Curle told the club's website.
"He got promoted out of this division last season and he has a good amount of experience in a key position."
