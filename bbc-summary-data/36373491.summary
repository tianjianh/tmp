Andy Murray: Amelie Mauresmo split not due to on-court behaviour

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
British number one Andy Murray says suggestions his partnership with coach Amelie Mauresmo ended because of his on-court behaviour are "untrue".

The pair split after two years with new mother Mauresmo saying she could not devote enough time to the job.
She also described the Scot, 29, as "complex" and said his on-court behaviour was confusing.
But he said: "To say that is why we stopped working together is untrue. We have a good relationship."
The world number three began working with Frenchwoman Mauresmo in June 2014, winning seven titles - including his first two on clay - during their time together.
But the two-time Grand Slam champion has failed to add to his major wins at the 2012 US Open and 2013 Wimbledon.
On Tuesday he reached the second round of this year's French Open after needing five sets to beat Czech veteran Radek Stepanek.
Afterwards Murray clarified reports about the reasons behind his split with Mauresmo, which came after his Madrid Open final defeat by Novak Djokovic.
"I've supposedly been 'hitting back' at Amelie's comments, disagreeing with everything she said and that we had a really tough break-up. Simply it is not true," he said.
"When we sat down in Madrid, anyone who says it was heated is lying and was not there. It was far from heated.
"We spoke very calmly the whole time. To say the reason we stopped working together is because of my behaviour on the court is not true.
"When we were working together we discussed many things on the court and there were times when, like with all of my coaches, she said 'you need to concentrate on the match and stop directing your frustration at your box and being distracted from what's going on on the court'.
"But to say that is why we stopped working together is untrue."
Murray said ahead of the French Open he is not in a rush to replace Mauresmo, having added fellow Briton Jamie Delgado to his team in February.
