[SN]TITLE[SN]
Breast flash GMP police chief committed 'gross misconduct'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A top police officer who exposed her breast and mocked a colleague's "boob job" committed gross misconduct, a panel has decided.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Assistant Chief Constable Rebekah Sutcliffe, 47, called temporary Supt Sarah Jackson "silly, vain and frivolous" for going under the knife.
The ruling has been released by Greater Manchester Police (GMP) disciplinary panel after a three-day hearing.
The panel recommended that Ms Sutcliffe receive a written warning.
A statement from Supt Jackson said there had been "incorrect reports" of her involvement in the incident. She said she had not been a willing participant.
"Despite not initiating or encouraging the incident, I greatly regret that members of the public had to witness it and that the reputation of Greater Manchester Police has been damaged by it, as these are two things I care very deeply about," she said.
The tribunal heard the officers were attending a Senior Women In Policing conference at Manchester's Hilton Hotel when Ms Sutcliffe told Supt Jackson her "credibility was zero" after she had a "boob job".
She said her colleague was a "laughing stock" who would be judged professionally "on the size of her tits".
Ms Sutcliffe went on to pull down the front of her dress to expose her left breast and said: "Look at these, look at these, these are the breasts of someone who has had three children.
"They are ugly but I don't feel the need to pump myself full of silicone to get self-esteem."
Panel chair Rachel Crasnow QC told Ms Sutcliffe she behaved "shockingly, cruelly and hurtfully to Sarah Jackson".
She added: "This case has taken Assistant Chief Constable Sutcliffe to the very precipice of dismissal - what has saved her has been her contrition, the steps she has taken and must continue to take to reform herself."
Ms Sutcliffe had admitted misconduct, but had denied gross misconduct.
The hearing was adjourned and the force's Deputy Chief Constable Ian Pilling will decide whether to enact the written warning recommendation at a later date.
