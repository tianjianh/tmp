RMT union members working on the Caledonian Sleeper rail service linking Scotland and London have voted overwhelmingly in favour of strike action.

In the ballot, 91% voted in favour of the industrial action. They also backed action short of a strike.
The RMT said strikes were likely to be held before Christmas.
The union has claimed the operator Serco has failed to fix a raft of issues with the rolling stock.
Serco said Christmas was one of the service's busiest times of the year.
Peter Strachan, managing director of the Caledonian Sleeper, said:  "While we are disappointed that the RMT has voted in favour of industrial action and action short of a strike, we have not yet received notification from the RMT of their intention.
"Christmas is one of the busiest times of the year for the Caledonian Sleeper service and we therefore remain hopeful that we can minimise any disruption to guests."
