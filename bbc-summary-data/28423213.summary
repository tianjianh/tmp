The body of Alan Jeal was discovered on Perranporth beach on 25 February. He had multiple injuries and a pair of earphones stuffed in his mouth.
The show will feature a reconstruction of the body being found on Perranporth beach.
It also shows his last movements and bus journeys he took around Wadebridge, Truro, Newquay and Perranporth.
Det Ch Insp Dave Thorne, who features in the programme, said: "It has been five months since Alan's body was found and there are still many unanswered questions in this case.
"We are hoping that this latest appeal will bring us new leads to help us solve the mystery and bring closure to the family."
The programme also features interviews with Alan's brother Derek Jeal and some unseen family photographs of Alan as a younger man.
Officers have released new CCTV footage of Mr Jeal outside Bridge Tools in Wadebridge at about 16:45 GMT on 24 February. He was wearing a light-blue jacket, which has not been recovered.
Officers are also keen to trace a potential witness who was seen on CCTV at the bus stop in Truro's Lemon Quay at 18:19 GMT on 24 February.
Officers believe the man, with grey hair, wearing a long dark coat and fisherman's style hat, saw Mr Jeal while waiting for a bus.
