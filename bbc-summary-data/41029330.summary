Glamorgan cantered into their first T20 Finals Day since 2004 with a comprehensive nine-wicket quarter-final win over Leicestershire at Cardiff.

Leicestershire were dismissed for only 123 with Craig Meschede (3-17) and Graham Wagg (2-12) among the wickets.
Luke Ronchi (28) and Ned Eckersley (25) lacked support after a promising start by the Foxes, who elected to bat first.
Glamorgan chased 124 with 38 balls to spare as Colin Ingram (70 not out) and Jacques Rudolph (46 not out) dominated.
Glamorgan join Hampshire at Finals Day on Saturday, 2 September at Edgbaston, having been knocked out in the quarter-finals last season.
South Africa-born Ingram survived being dropped on 16 and 26 before registering his 22nd career T20 half-century in a 43-ball innings that included five fours and five sixes.
Three-time champions Leicestershire's bid to reach Finals Day for the first time since 2011 fell apart as they slumped to 90-6.
Meschede, Ingram and Marchant de Lange (2-23) all tightened the screw for Glamorgan with the ball as they each delivered a dozen dot balls in their four-over spells.
Notts Outlaws host Somerset on Thursday before Friday's final quarter-final between Surrey and Birmingham Bears.
Man of the match Colin Ingram told BBC Wales Sport: "They got off to a pretty quick start and for the bowlers to respond the way they did to attack them and get those wickets, was what set up the win.
"A special mention to Craig Meschede who bowled an incredible spell which turned the game on its head.
"It's never quite as easy as you think chasing these low scores, but I really enjoy batting with Jacques. It was nice just to play freely and get on with it.
"We had to right the wrong from last year when we lost disappointingly here in the quarters, so it was nice to put on a good display for the crowd, to hear them chanting, and we can all get excited for Finals Day now."
