Frozen soundtrack is the top selling album of 2014 so far

At some point this year you've heard the song Let It Go performed by Idina Menzel.

You've probably even sung it in the shower. If not, where have you been?
Frozen's signature ballad has helped the film's soundtrack outsell every other album released in 2014 so far and includes a range of different songs sung by members of the cast.
It includes the instrumental score written for the film by composer Christophe Beck as well.
So far figures from The Official Charts Company say it's sold 708,000 copies in the UK in 2014.
That's more than any artist or compilation album and is nearly 80,000 more copies than Ed Sheeran's latest offering X.
In March this year the film overtook Toy Story 3 to become the highest grossing animated movie of all time at the box office.
It's number 10 in the list of highest grossing films of any genre (Avatar is number 1 in case you were wondering).
Not bad for a film about two sisters and a snowman.
Earlier this year Frozen won two Oscars for best animated feature and best original song for 'Let It Go'.
The figures put together by The Official Chart Company also show that the Disney movie is top of the DVD and Blu-ray sales list for this year as well.
You can listen to the The Official Chart Show with Jameela Jamil on Sunday between 4pm and 7pm on Radio 1.
