A Canadian captured by the Taliban in Afghanistan has been freed after more than five years in captivity.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Colin Rutherford was released on Monday, following efforts brokered by the Qatari government, Canadian Foreign Minister Stephane Dion said.
The Taliban announced the capture of Mr Rutherford in 2011, accusing him of being a spy. Mr Rutherford denied this, saying he was a tourist.
In a statement, the Taliban said he had been released on humanitarian grounds.
Mr Rutherford was freed on Monday morning in central Ghazni province, local police chief Aminullah Amarkhil said in quotes carried by AP.
He was flown out in a helicopter from the remote district of Giro, the police chief added.
The Taliban said it had released Mr Rutherford out of humanitarian considerations.
There were no further details on Mr Rutherford's release and it is not clear how an agreement was reached.
The Taliban have freed other Western hostages in recent years
Monday's release came as Afghan, Pakistani, Chinese and US officials met for talks aimed at establishing a roadmap for peace between the Afghan government and the Taliban.
Peace talks between them collapsed last year after news emerged that Taliban leader Mullah Omar had in fact died in 2013.
His deputy Mullah Mansour was declared leader in July but a number of senior Taliban commanders refused to pledge allegiance to him and set up a rival faction.
