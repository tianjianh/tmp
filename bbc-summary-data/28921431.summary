Hamilton's race was effectively ended when he suffered a puncture on lap two at Spa after Rosberg collided with him.
The German went on to finish second, extending his lead in the championship to 29 points with seven races left.
"We just had a meeting about it and he basically said he did it on purpose," said Hamilton.
The 2008 world champion added: "He said he could have avoided it, but he didn't want to. He basically said, 'I did it to prove a point'."
Hamilton said he was "gobsmacked" by Rosberg's admission.
"He just came in there and said it was my fault," added Hamilton, who returned to the race after having his left rear tyre replaced only to quit with just a few laps remaining.
Mercedes said Hamilton's remarks were a "broadly accurate" representation of what went on in the meeting.
Rosberg has issued a statement since the Mercedes meeting, but did not make a reference to his remarks.
He said he "regretted that Lewis and myself touched but I see it as a racing incident.
"I was quicker at the time and there was an opportunity, so I gave it a go around the outside as the inside was blocked.
"The opportunity was there and, for me, it wasn't a risky situation."
Mercedes Formula 1 boss Toto Wolff has already said the incident was "absolutely unacceptable" and blamed Rosberg for causing it.
"You don't try to overtake with the knife between your teeth on lap number two and damage both cars," said Wolff.
"Lap number two of a long race, a crash between two team-mates. It is absolutely unacceptable."
Asked if he could trust the German on the track again, Hamilton said: "I don't really know how to approach the next race."
The Englishman had already claimed that Rosberg would escape any kind of punishment from Mercedes.
But Wolff indicated that he could face action.
"If Lewis has said that it's going to be a slap on the wrist and that there's going to be no consequence, then he's not aware of what consequences we can implement," said the Mercedes chief.

Hamilton said that Rosberg had admitted on Thursday in a team meeting that he was still harbouring resentment over the team orders controversy at the previous race in Hungary.
The Briton refused to let Rosberg past, claiming they were both racing for victory, and said the team told him he had done nothing wrong.
Sunday's incident in Belgium came as Hamilton led heading into the Les Combes chicane after overtaking polesitter Rosberg at the start.
As Hamilton turned into the second left-handed part of the chicane, Rosberg's front wing clipped his left rear wheel.
Hamilton claimed he was in the right and said other drivers, such as Ferrari's Fernando Alonso, would back that view.
"When a car is less than half a car's length alongside you, it's not your job to leave extra room," said Hamilton.
"I knew he was behind, so I continued my line and thought for sure there would be an investigation or something about it."
Wolff's criticism of Rosberg, who was booed during the post-race presentations, was echoed by former world champion Niki Lauda - who is a key member of the Mercedes team - and former F1 driver David Coulthard.

But Eddie Jordan, a former team boss and now a BBC pundit, said he felt the Mercedes leadership was to blame.
"I think the management of the Mercedes team has been weak," he said. "They should have taken control.
"Like a child who has been naughty, they have to chastise the drivers, they have to tell them what is right and wrong. You do not attack each other in the first two laps,"
Red Bull's Daniel Ricciardo won the race as Rosberg extended his advantage over Hamilton with seven races remaining.
The next race is the Italian Grand Prix at Monza on 7 September.
