A Lancashire Police spokesman said no formal identification has been made but the body is believed to be Louis Simpson who was missing since Sunday.
Louis had not been seen since a blaze broke in the barn storing straw at Fairhurst Hall, Parbold.
The body was found in the barn on Monday evening and a post-mortem examination is due to take place later.
The spokesman said: "After an extensive search of the area, a body was recovered from the barn (on Monday). While yet to be formally identified, the body is sadly believed to be Louis.
"Louis' family have been informed this morning and they are being supported by specially trained officers. Our thoughts are with them at this time."
The fire's cause is still being investigated but there are no suspicious circumstance, he added.
Det Supt Neil Ashton said on Monday it appeared a group of friends were "playing in a rural setting" and were at the barn when the fire started.
The barn had been storing about 250 tonnes of straw.
