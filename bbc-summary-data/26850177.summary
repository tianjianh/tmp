At level 10, adults and children with lung or heart problems, and older people, should avoid "strenuous" physical activity altogether - such as exercising outside in the afternoon when levels are particularly high.
When the reading is between seven and nine, those with health and lung problems should reduce physical activity, and those with asthma may find they need to use their inhaler more frequently.
