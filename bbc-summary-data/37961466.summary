[SN]TITLE[SN]
Permission sought for 'rising flood house' in Lincolnshire

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A housing company has applied for planning permission to build an experimental house that could rise on jacks above flood waters.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The design by Lincolnshire-based Larkfleet Homes can lift the property up to about five feet (1.5m) above the ground.
Larkfleet's chief executive Karl Hick said testing of a prototype had been successful.
The firm now wants to build a "live property" at Weston Hills, Spalding.
Mr Hick said the design allows the property to be raised depending on the flood risk.
He said: "Out prototype has worked wonderfully well, and there have been no issues."
"What we want to do now is get a live property with people living in it, and see how it works over a period of time."
If plans are given the go-ahead by South Holland District Council the firm hopes "to have it up and running in the latter part of 2017", he added.
