The seafronts at Southend and Canvey Island have both been badly hit with some roads into the area affected.
The fire and rescue service have been called to 13 flood-related incidents, including clearing a house and nursery that had become flooded in Colchester.
The Met Office has issued a yellow weather warning, with further torrential rain expected in some areas into Wednesday morning.
Floodwater on the A12 forced the closure of one lane, London-bound near Junction 14.

Abellio Greater Anglia services in and out of London have been disrupted by overhead wire problems - not known to be caused by the weather - at Stratford.
Barry Campagna, an independent councillor for Canvey Island, said:  "There's nobody here, the whole of the seafront is empty, the kids are off school and it should be buzzing.
"The drains can't take the amount of surface water on Canvey."
Suzanne Gray, who runs an arcade on Furtherwick Road, Canvey, which is also flooded, said: "I've been here 20 years. The last three years it seems to be getting worse and worse."
It was a similar story in Southend.
"In two minutes, the whole of the seafront was flooded yet again, in up to 18 inches of water," said Happidrome arcade owner Martin Richardson.
Tesco tweeted a photo of flooding outside its Extra store in Southend, but said it was "dealing with the water" and would open as normal.
Other areas affected include Rochford and Westcliff.
The Met Office's yellow warning - meaning " be aware" -  is for the East of England.
It said although most parts of the region would escape the worst, there was a risk of locally torrential, thundery bursts and flash flooding.
