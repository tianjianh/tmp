Light Christmas: The people dedicated to illuminating their homes

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Every year for the past two decades Lee and Paul Brailsford have been adorning their mother's home with Christmas lights and decorations. However, their 50,000-light extravaganza seems to be bucking the national trend, with council bureaucracy, electricity bills and even Storm Desmond appearing to have taken the shine off other domestic displays. BBC News shines a light on the practice of festive home illumination.

Piers Brown, from The Christmas Decorators, which installs festive lights and decorations, credits the 1990 Christmas movie Home Alone, starring Macaulay Culkin, for the explosion in external lighting.
"Christmas is very deep-set in American culture and as our cultures are becoming more and more alike, it is a tradition which has crossed the Atlantic," he said.
In Dorset, where he is based, he said residents tended to opt for "simple, clean, crisp" lighting.
"People who retreat to the countryside at Christmas want to get away from the bright lights of the city," he said.
However, if the displays are created for children, he said they tended to be more fun.
"We've had a three metre-high snowman on a garage and reindeers in the shrubbery," Mr Brown added.
He also said sequencing flashing lights to music was growing in popularity across the country, as technology advanced.
Although the firm has decked the homes of celebrities, including Mariah Carey and Coleen Rooney, adorning your home for Christmas does not have to be expensive.
"Less is more - even something as simple as a wreath and garlands around the door," Mr Brown said.
One group of residents who joined the trend for lighting up their entire street 15 years ago has now pulled the plug, after being "subjected to an increasing level of criticism" and red tape.
In 2013, police were called after hundreds of people turned up and clogged the streets near Greyhound Close in Hedge End, Hampshire.
Eastleigh Borough Council said it also received a number of complaints last year from neighbouring residents and councillors.
And so it was lights-out after residents said they were not prepared for taxpayers to foot a traffic management plan bill, including signage and marshals, which "escalated to a mind-blowing £19,500".
The display had raised tens of thousands of pounds for children's charities over the years.
Elsewhere, a house in Melksham, Wiltshire, has remained in the dark this year after the man who usually adorns it was put off by the media attention this attracted.
Alex Goodhind's display started in 1995, and over that time had cost him about £20,000.
In recent years, 180,000 bulbs were used, along with 600m (2,000ft) of cable and 2,000 cable ties.
The display was so well-known B&Q used an image of it on an advert, albeit without permission.
Meanwhile, Kevin and Wendy Sheldon have admitted to "cutting back" and reusing old decorations, including a 90-year-old fairy tree-topper that belonged to their grandmother.
However, the brother and sister, from Nottingham, who started their display more than 20 years ago, claim they would "get told off" by local residents if they decided to stop the show altogether.
"We've got a glowing Santa, another Santa climbing up a ladder, Santa on a see-saw, Santa in a hot-air balloon - you name it, we've got it," said Ms Sheldon.
One self-confessed scrooge from Lancashire, who refuses to have a Christmas tree inside his house, has, however, been lighting up the outside for the past 18 years like the Blackpool illuminations - quite literally.
"I bought some some old Blackpool illuminations for the display - big Holland's Pies vans," said Ian Clifton.
What started out as "a few strings of lights" has since turned his home in Lincoln Close into "an institution", he added.
However, this year Storm Desmond threatened to ruin the show after causing a week-long power blackout.
Mr Clifton said he had always had a fairy light "fascination", but bizarrely added: "I don't like Christmas."
"There's nowt in the house at all - when I shut the door them lights are outside."
Despite that, he spends several weeks erecting the display, as well as dealing with "absolutely miles of cabling".
It costs him an extra £300 in electricity over Christmas but he says he has raised £57,000 for charity.
Perhaps surprisingly though, over the festive period as a nation we actually use less electricity as a nation, the National Grid said.
With factories, shops and offices closed on Christmas Day there is a significant drop compared to a normal winter's day.
Also, modern LED lights make illuminating a house less costly.
Forecasters, who spend 11 weeks planning our Christmas electricity usage, are predicting a demand of about 35,410 MW - enough to light up 3.5 billion Christmas trees.
"Demand rises steadily as people wake up and begin turning on their ovens to cook their turkeys, and reaches a peak around lunchtime," said forecasting manager Jeremy Caplin.
As well as past trends his team looks at weather forecasts and television listings.
Mr Caplin said the biggest Christmas Day "pick-up" - a surge in electricity use - followed an episode of Only Fools and Horses in 1996.
This year the team is predicting the last ever Downton Abbey to receive the biggest surge.
For the likes of Wendy Sheldon, Christmas planning will start again in the January sales where she'll pick up some bargains for next year's display.
"The kiddies in the street start asking, 'are you putting you're lights up yet?' and I say, 'no, it's only July'," she said.
