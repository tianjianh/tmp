[SN]TITLE[SN]
Nigeria's ex-Interior Minister Abba Moro charged over stampede

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Nigeria's ex-interior minister has been charged with fraud over a botched recruitment drive, which resulted in stampedes that left 20 people dead.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Abba Moro led a scheme which encouraged young graduates to apply for jobs in the immigration ministry in March 2014.
Stadiums, which were being used as test centres, were overwhelmed by huge crowds of people turning up to apply.
Mr Moro has pleaded not guilty to his role in an alleged $2.5m (Â£1.8m) fraud, involving missing application fees.
There is a high level of unemployment in Nigeria, especially among young people.
Court papers filed by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) allege that more than 675,000 people were defrauded by the scheme, which required them to pay a $6 (Â£3.50) application fee to take the initial recruitment test.
The case has been adjourned until 2 March.
On 15 March 2014 deadly stampedes occurred at stadiums in the Nigerian cities of Abuja, Benin and Port Harcourt, as well as a school in Mina city, as people scrambled to apply for the new jobs.
Many Nigerians online have been commenting on the irony that a former minister in charge of the country's prisons is facing a lengthy stint behind bars if he is found guilty.
At the time, Nigeria's interior minister rejected calls for him to step down and initially refused to accept any responsibility for the disaster.
He blamed the officials in charge of the stadium for the deaths, as well as the job seekers themselves.
