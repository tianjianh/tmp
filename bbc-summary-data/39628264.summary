The East Sussex potter lost 10-8 to world number 11 Mark Allen, but Allen said Robertson deserved to win.
"I had plenty of chances and felt I played the better in the first session," said Robertson, who led 7-6.
"It came down to a best of three at the end and he finished it off pretty well."
It was 30-year-old Robertson's third appearance at snooker's showpiece event, having lost 10-1 to Mark Selby in 2011 and 10-6 to Marco Fu in 2015.
He added: "It wasn't to be but was an improvement on the last two times I have been here.
"There was plenty of positives. I felt pretty comfortable and hopefully I can kick on."
Robertson failed to get beyond the third round of a tournament this season, but said progressing through three qualifying rounds at Pond's Forge to reach the Crucible was a big boost.
"I have not had the best of seasons so it was nice to finish by getting here," he added. "I will chill out and then get back to the hard work for the new season."
