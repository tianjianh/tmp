[SN]TITLE[SN]
Plans for former Aberdeen school recommended for refusal

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Plans to demolish a granite former primary school in Aberdeen to make way for homes have been recommended for refusal by council officials after a public hearing.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
More than 260 objections were lodged against the proposals for Victoria Road school, which shut its doors in 2008.
There were objections to the housing plans on the grounds of what was said would be the loss of granite heritage.
A report will be considered by councillors next week.
