Donegal's Ryan McHugh is believed to be optimistic that the ankle injured he sustained against Monaghan on Sunday is not as serious as first feared.

McHugh will have a scan in Letterkenny Hospital on Wednesday.
The Kilcar man underwent treatment at Ulster University Jordanstown campus on Monday which included a session in the campus' hydro pool.
2016 Allstar McHugh has been Donegal's most impressive performer during the Football League.
Such have been his recent displays, some people now view McHugh as being as crucial to Donegal's fortunes as captain Michael Murphy.
At this stage, McHugh has not been ruled out of Donegal's final Division One round robin game against Mayo in Castlebar.
A Donegal victory this weekend will guarantee them a place in the Division One final if Monaghan fail to beat Dublin at Clones.
However, Donegal will face a Mayo side needing a draw to ensure they retain their Division One status.
A Mayo defeat will see them going down if Cavan defeat already-relegated Roscommon at Dr Hyde Park.
Dublin set a new league and championship record of 35 games unbeaten when they hammered Roscommon last weekend and Jim Gavin's side will be expected to avoid defeat at St Tiernach's Park.
McHugh is understood to have sustained the injury which his foot got caught a rut on the Ballyshannon pitch.
