Milan were losing 2-0 through Luca Paganini and Oliver Kragl, when Balotelli, on loan from Liverpool, saw his penalty kept out after 48 minutes.
Carlos Bacca gave Milan hope two minutes later but Federico Dionisi extended the visitors' lead.
Luca Antonelli pulled one back and Jeremy Menez scored an injury-time penalty before Balotelli hit the bar.
Milan have only won one of their last nine Serie A matches and drop to seventh.
Their caretaker-boss Cristian Brocchi said: "This match leaves a bitter taste in the mouth. We didn't lose heart despite missing a penalty.
"We created a lot of chances, hit the crossbar twice and missed a penalty. We played for the win right until the end. We put in a good performance, we created chances."
