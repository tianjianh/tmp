£300m savings for 'unsustainable' Tata Steel

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Tata Steel hopes to make £300m of savings and warned its current performance was "unsustainable".

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The company announced last week about 750 of the 1,050 job cuts being made around the UK would go in Port Talbot.
A document seen by BBC Wales showed shedding 394 office staff and 332 from the main workforce would save £50m.
It warned the plant "must significantly improve its performance and reduce costs to survive".
Port Talbot and the Llanwern site in Newport manufactures strip steel products.
The document added another £54m would be saved by mothballing parts of Llanwern.
