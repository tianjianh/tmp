Alex Jeffery, 21, was hit after being involved in a fight outside the Cambridge City Hotel, on Downing Street, on 1 November, police said.
Mr Jeffery, of Orchard Road in Melbourn, was taken to hospital but died from his injuries a week later.
A post-mortem examination is due to take place in the next few days.
In a statement, Mr Jeffery's family said he was a "fun loving, kind and caring son, grandson and brother".
Det Ch Insp Jerome Kent, who is leading the investigation, said he believed some people had seen what happened during the incident at 03:40 GMT but had not yet spoken to police.
"In particular I am keen to speak to the two security guards who came to Alex's aid," he said.
"I would also urge anyone who may have been travelling in the car involved in this incident or knows who the driver is to come forward.
"This is a devastating and traumatic time for the family and is it vital we catch the person responsible."
