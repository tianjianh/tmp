The 19-year-old came through the Rams' youth ranks and made his first-team debut against Carlisle in the EFL Cup earlier this season.
England Under-20 international Lowe made his first Championship start in the 2-0 win at Cardiff on Tuesday.
"I really hope that this is just the start and I know that I still have lots to learn as a player," he said.
"It has been a great journey for me to get to this stage, having joined at the age of 10, but I know I've not achieved anything yet and I'll continue to work extremely hard."
