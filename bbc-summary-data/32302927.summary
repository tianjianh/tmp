[SN]TITLE[SN]
Chantal Clark sentenced for false rape claim in Midlothian

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A married woman who falsely claimed she had been raped by a taxi driver in Midlothian has been sentenced to 200 hours of community service.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A major inquiry was launched after Chantal Clark, 36, from Dalkeith, claimed she had been sexually assaulted by the driver in May 2014.
Clark later pleaded guilty to a charge of falsely making a rape claim.
She had engaged in consensual sex with the driver, who cannot be named for legal reasons.
Edinburgh Sheriff Court heard how the investigation resulted in the man appearing in court on a rape charge.
The inquiry also cost the taxpayer about Â£3,000.
On Tuesday, Sheriff Alistair Noble told Clark that cases of this type usually resulted in custodial sentences being imposed.
However, she escaped prison because she was a first offender who pleaded guilty to the charge.
