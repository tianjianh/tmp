Teenager admits hurling abuse at Rachel and Nyomi Fee

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A teenager who hurled abuse at child murderers Rachel and Nyomi Fee outside court has been spared jail.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Her lawyer successfully argued that she might be regarded as "some kind of hero" if she was sent to prison.
At Livingston Sheriff Court the 17-year-old, who cannot be named for legal reasons, admitted shouting homophobic abuse at the couple.
A television news crew recorded her comments as they filmed the pair arriving at court for their trial.
They were found guilty on Tuesday of murdering Rachel's son, Liam Fee, and of abusing two other children.
The teenager, from Livingston, pled guilty to behaving in a manner likely to cause a reasonable person fear or alarm by shouting and swearing aggravated by sexual orientation.
Sheriff Jamie Gilmour took other unrelated offences into account when he sentenced her to be electronically tagged on a nine-month curfew.
He also placed her under supervision for two years and ordered her to carry out 200 hours of unpaid work within nine months.
