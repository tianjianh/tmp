Plans have been put forward for a new hotel on the derelict site at the entrance to Aviemore.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Premier Inn wants to build the 60-bedroom facility on land which has been vacant since the closure of a filling station on the site over a decade ago.
Parent company Whitbread said it would invest Â£6.5m in the project.
It has also said the hotel would create the equivalent of 25 full-time jobs.
