More than 350 scientists will attend the four-day British Science Festival at Swansea University from Tuesday.
It features talks and lectures from experts in different fields.
Hilary Lappin-Scott said there was a shortage of core workers in Wales and it was important to bring in more girls and keep women in those careers.
The university is running a session on promoting women in science and how to get girls interested.
Ms Lappin-Scott, who is also a microbiologist, told BBC Radio Wales: "I'm so committed to getting our young girls through the Swansea region and south Wales so that they get a passion for science - that they meet women scientists and engineers just like me and others and realise we're just pretty normal people really, and then we can have a bright future."
"Bringing in more girls and keeping women in stem careers, it'll make such a difference to our Welsh economy."
She added that making the stem subjects science, technology, maths and engineering "cool" was key.
"We do need all to work with our young children and give support to school teachers and parents.
"Maths, science, these are at the base of everything we do in everyday life. [There are] ways that we can make science cool as well, and you come along to the festival and you get that by the bucket load," she told Good Morning Wales.
