Newport Gwent Dragons players deserve dual deals - Jones

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Newport Gwent Dragons head coach Kingsley Jones says more players at the region deserve national dual contracts (NDC) with the Welsh Rugby Union.

Backs Tyler Morgan and Hallam Amos are the only current Dragons who are among the 16 players on dual contracts.
Former Wales captain Jones says centre Jack Dixon, hooker Elliot Dee and flanker Ollie Griffiths are in line for consideration.
"They're certainly players I think can go on and play for Wales" Jones said.
"The Welsh Rugby Union have to look carefully at it.
"I would look to centrally contract the main core players and then, as they have done with Tyler and Hallam, to keep the periphery in Wales for the future."
Dixon and Griffiths, both 20, and 21-year-old Dee have represented Wales at Under-20 level.
The total of players on a NDC is now 16, with salaries funded 60% by the Welsh Rugby Union and 40% by the regions.
Dragons number eight Taulupe Faletau turned down a dual contract in May 2015 and Bath's recent bid to sign him was vetoed by Wales coach Warren Gatland.
Jones has not given up hope of Faletau signing for the Dragons and Wales despite his aborted move to the English Premiership side.
"Of course there's a chance, this is his home," Jones added.
"The market-place in England and France is difficult to compete with but let's hope he gets a central contract."
Faletau is a slight doubt for the Sale Sharks game in the European Challenge Cup with a sore knee, while fellow backrower Nick Crosswell is available after suspension.
Former Wales hooker and Dragons captain Rhys Thomas may play for the Dragons' British and Irish Cup side against Connacht in his comeback from a foot injury.
