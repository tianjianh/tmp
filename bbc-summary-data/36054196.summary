Luton Airport has announced plans for a £200m tube-style link that will cut journey times to London to less than 30 minutes.

The driverless trains will run 24 hours a day connecting the airport to Luton Airport Parkway station.
The 2.3km (1.4 mile) rail link is due to be completed by the end of 2020.
Airport bosses hope it will encourage more passengers to use public transport rather than drive.

The link would means transfers will take less than five minutes compared to the current system where passengers have to wait for an airport shuttle bus, which takes about 15 minutes.
Cllr Andy Malcolm, Chair of London Luton Airport Ltd, said: "A total journey time of less than 30 minutes from St Pancras to the airport will beat the time from Liverpool Street to Stansted by 20 minutes and better the time from Victoria to Gatwick too."
Three stations plus tunnels and bridges will have to be built over a dual carriageway.
A planning application is expected to be submitted in the Autumn, with construction starting next year.
More than one million passengers used the airport last month, which bosses said was a new record. It is the fastest growing airport in the UK and is forecasting a 50% increase in passengers, to 18 million, by 2020.
