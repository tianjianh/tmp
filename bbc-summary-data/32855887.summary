Carl Froch: I need Gennady Golovkin fear factor to fight again

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Carl Froch says the "fear factor" of WBA middleweight champion Gennady Golovkin could persuade him to continue his career.

The Briton, 37, will make a decision on his future in June after being stripped of the WBA super-middleweight belt for not defending his title.
Froch told BBC Radio 5 live: "I need the motivation, I need the fear factor and Golovkin brings that.
"If I decide to fight again, Golovkin's an opponent I'd definitely like."
He added: "But it's a very big 'if' because one of my options is to retire."
Froch, who has already given up his IBF belt, has not fought since defeating George Groves at Wembley nearly a year ago.
A clash with Julio Chavez Jr in Las Vegas in March fell through because of the Nottingham fighter's elbow injury.
"I still love boxing, that's the problem, and at 37 I know I can still do it," said Froch. "I don't want to look back at 43 and say 'why didn't I take that one last fight?'
"I can safely say in maybe the first week of June I will be making an announcement."
Kazakhstan's Golovkin, 33, is unbeaten in 33 professional fights, including 30 knockouts.
Froch's promoter Eddie Hearn told the Daily Mail: "We have already opened negotiations with Golovkin's people and they are very keen.
"I only want Carl to take it if he's genuinely motivated because it is a high-risk fight."
Froch has already confirmed he is not interested in fighting the winner of Saturday's IBF super-middleweight title fight between Britain's James DeGale and Andre Dirrell in Boston.
