A Winter Wonderland ride which left people dangling 65ft (20m) in the air will not return to Cardiff this year.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Sky Swing had to be closed three times in December 2014.
During one incident 12 customers were stranded on the ride for 30 minutes. The emergency services put the ride into recovery mode and brought them all down safely.
Sayers Amusements, which owns the attraction, said they would put up a giant ferris wheel instead.
A spokesman said: "After there were some issues with the Sky Swing last year, it was decided that it would be best to change the ride this year.
"The giant wheel is still a spectacular ride which gives amazing views over Cardiff."
The funfair opens on Thursday and runs until 3 January.
