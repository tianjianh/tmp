The fire took hold in agricultural buildings at Mount Pleasant Farm in Goring Heath shortly after 10:00 GMT.
The fire service said the smoke had settled in residential areas and breathing it in would "not be pleasant".
Crews drenched the fire, which is now under control, using eight appliances.
Oxfordshire County Council Fire and Rescue Service said firefighters were expected to remain at the site throughout the day.
The service said no people or animals had been hurt as a result of the fire.
It said an investigation into the cause of the blaze, which is thought to have started in buildings housing a generator, was under way.
