Forecasters are predicting more rain later and throughout Sunday.
Fire crews are visiting flooded homes in Appleby to check residents are safe.
In Sedbergh, resident Lester Close said the flooding was the highest he had seen in 54 years living there.
He said: "There's just more and more water pouring down the road, it's horrendous all over.
"Not many roads will be passable now."
According to an Environment Agency gauge on the River Kent in Cumbria, the water is 12in (30cm) higher than in 2010, the previous record.
The Environment Agency said about 60 homes in low-lying parts of Corbridge were expected to be flooded with some already affected.
A spokesman said: "If you are caught in a flash flood, get to higher ground. Stay away from floodwater and don't take risks."
He urged people in the affected areas to move their family, pets and valuables to a safe place.
He added: "Heavy rain is currently falling in the Tyne Catchment and will continue throughout Saturday.
"River levels on the River Tyne are rising and are expected to rise through the day."
The spokesman said some homes in Well Bank had already flooded and the agency expected water to reach the top of the floodwall at the Stanners later.
Northumbria Police said they have also received reports of flooding in parts of Hexham.
Supt Geoff Logan said: "We are working closely with the other emergency services and partner agencies to plan and respond to flooding."
Premises along the River Wear in lower Stanhope in Weardale are also being warned of an imminent flood risk.
Warnings are also in place for the River Tees at Hurworth Place, Newbus Grange and Low Dinsdale after a night of heavy rain fall has swollen the river.
Flood gates at Yarm and Croft have been closed this morning.
Flooding has closed the A591 in Cumbria in both directions between Ambleside and Windermere, and the A6 is closed at Plumpton.
Several events have also been cancelled including the Newcastle Christmas Market.
