Jon Hamm, who was sporting a beard during our interview (a trademark look for Game of Thrones), said he would love to be part of the show.

The Black Mirror star admitted that 2015 will be the first time in a long time that he has no job to look forward to, but could that change by him joining the cast of Game of Thrones?
Hamm is most famous for playing media executive Don Draper in  Mad Men, about the US advertising industry in the 1960s.
The second half of the final series will air in 2015.
But Jon has told Newsbeat that he's looking for any opportunity to be part of the Game Of Thrones crew.
"Game of Thrones would be great, yeah" he admitted. "Anything with a sword would be awesome.
"I've not read the books, although I did have dinner once with George RR Martin, which was really cool and it took everything in me to not ask how it all ends and who wins.
"So maybe, I don't know how it ends, but maybe I could be the one who wins the Game of Thrones."
Jon is starring in the next instalment of Black Mirror alongside Oona Chaplin and Rafe Spall, and this time it is a feature-length special.
"It's three stories that are interlinked," Jon said about his new show.
"Rafe and I exist in this remote outpost and we start unspooling these stories.
"So it's very much similar to sort of a creepy fireside chat in many ways, but it all pulls together in a very satisfyingly disturbing way."
The 43-year-old also revealed that he comes from a town about two miles from Ferguson.
There were violent protests there and in several other US cities in November.
They were caused by a jury's decision not to charge a policeman over the killing of an unarmed black teenager in Ferguson, Missouri.
"I used to ride my bike through Ferguson to go buy comic books, because the comic book store was on the other side," said Hamm.
"I'll say this about that, obviously it's an incredibly difficult situation and unfortunately a young man lost his life, that's the end of the argument with that.
"But the society and media landscape that we live in now, lets us immediately jump to judgement and jump to a narrative that isn't necessarily supported by factual evidence or really any evidence. It's just all pure emotion.
"And it's unfortunate because it tends to, what do they say, a lie can get around the world faster before the truth pulls its socks on, you know, something like that.
"And it's tough, it's very, very difficult, because obviously there was wrongdoing there. And you can't look at it in any other way.
"But it's also painted an unfortunate representation of the community.
"Again, I'm from there, I know a lot of people that still live in Ferguson and I grew up right around the corner from it.
"And it's not this kind of lawless place that's been sort of painted in the media. I think people do that for their own specific prejudices and reasons, and that's not helpful.
"You know a helpful thing would be for everybody to take two steps back, take a breath and really take a look at it, instead of just immediately going to 11 and screaming as loud as they can on Twitter and on Facebook.
"You know, as soon as they put a camera up, everybody goes crazy. And it's too bad, because it's a lovely community and it's worth a deeper discussion."
Jon also commented on reports that he was snubbed for the recent nominations for the Society of Actors Guild (SAG) awards and the Golden Globes.
"If people feel like I was deserving of an award nomination and didn't get it, that's a lovely sentiment, but we've been on the air for a long time."
Black Mirror is on Channel 4 on Tuesday at 21:00 GMT
