A television reporter in Australia has been arrested on suspicion of sending images of child sexual abuse and having explicit conversations about children.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Ben McCormack, 42, a well-known reporter for the local A Current Affair programme, was arrested in Sydney.
Police searched an apartment and the offices of his employer, the Nine Network, seizing computers, a mobile phone and an electronic storage device.
The Nine Network immediately suspended Mr McCormack from his reporting duties.
Police released images of Mr McCormack's arrest, showing his face blurred, and charged him with using a carriage service for child pornography material.
"Police will allege in court the man was engaged in sexually explicit conversations about children with an adult male and discussed child pornography," New South Wales Police said in a statement.
The network said it had immediately suspended Mr McCormack, an employee for 25 years.
It said it would fully co-operate with the police investigation, which had nothing to do with the network or its programme.
A Current Affair told viewers it would cover the allegations "without fear or favour".
Mr McCormack was granted bail to appear in a Sydney court on 1 May.
