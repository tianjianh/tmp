An Australian man accused of trying to kill two backpackers met the pair online, police will reportedly allege.

The women, from Brazil and Germany, posted on the Gumtree website that they wanted a lift from Adelaide to Melbourne, reports say.
Police will allege in court that the man took the women to a remote beach near Salt Creek, south of Adelaide, where they were raped and beaten.
One of the women remains in hospital in Adelaide, two weeks after the attack.
The accused man was arrested at Coorong National Park on 9 February.
Details including his identity, vehicle and alleged actions during the crimes have been suppressed by court order.
Reports said the women, in their 20s, were rescued after they managed to escape and run off in different directions.
One was recaptured, but the other ran screaming from sand dunes towards a group of fishermen, witnesses said.
"She ran straight to the car yelling. She opened the back door, jumped straight in and like, 'get me out of here, get me out of here. He's going to kill us all'," fisherman Abdul-Karim Mohammed told 7 News.
The second woman was found barely conscious and unable to speak, the fishermen said.
The accused man is expected to face court again in April charged with attempted murder, unlawful sexual intercourse without consent, and kidnapping.
