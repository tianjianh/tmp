Electro Velvet get in the swing for Eurovision

It's that time of year again. The Eurovision Song Contest takes place later on Saturday, and the UK entry is hoping to avoid the humiliation of "nul points".

Electro Velvet - Bianca Nicholas and Alex Larke - were thrust into the spotlight in March when Still In Love With You, was selected as the UK's song. It's been a non-stop whirlwind ever since.
While some might describe Eurovision as a poisoned chalice, Nicholas and Larke had no hesitation in picking up the baton.
"I said yes straight away, it's just too big to turn down," says Nicholas.
"We said yes to the song even before we knew it was going to be entered," Larke adds.
"Then David (Mindel), who wrote the song, asked if it was ok to enter it for Eurovision.
It was a "split second decision," he says. "We didn't think twice about it. It is so huge to be in front of that many people."
The contest, which reaches hundreds of millions of viewers every year, is a world away from Larke's role as the frontman in a successful Rolling Stones tribute band -  the Rollin' Clones.
The singer, who also teaches in a primary school, acknowledges the challenge he faces.
"When you're doing the Stones stuff, you've got a legacy there already. It sells itself already as everyone knows the Stones. You're almost selling a product with this (Electro Velvet) because it's brand new."
Nicholas also has a background in music - she has performed for Prince William and the Duchess of Cambridge, had a track in the top 100 of the UK chart and auditioned for The Voice.
She got her break at the age of 15, thanks to the Starlight wish granting charity.
"I had a wish with them to record some songs. Through that I did a duet with Will Young and from there I got the bug."
Nicholas, who has the lung condition cystic fibrosis, ended up working for the charity but is now pursuing music full-time.
She says her current punishing promotional schedule hasn't been detrimental to her health.
"If anything it gives me motivation to make sure I'm looking after myself so that I am well enough to do everything. It pushes me to make sure I do my treatments."
So what's it like being in the Eurovision bubble?
"We're very fanatic, passionate Eurovision fans," Nicholas enthuses.
"It's definitely something you grow up watching. I have very fond memories of being allowed to stay up late especially to watch Eurovision with my family and it's incredible to now be a part of it," says Nicholas.
"It was part of that golden era of television really," Larke concurs.
"We only had four channels back in the '80s. It was such a huge thing It still is. My mum's Greekâ€¦ Who's going to get more points, UK or Greece?"
It's fair to say that all things Eurovision have changed since then, not least the UK's fortunes.
The UK has breached the top 10 once since Jemini's infamous "nul points" in 2003. That was when Jade Ewan was fifth in 2009 with the Andrew Lloyd Webber written song It's My Time.
Last year, Molly Smitten-Downes came 17th for the UK with Children of the Universe.
And the UK hasn't won since 1997,  when it was represented by Katrina and the Waves with Love Shine a Light.
It's no secret that Electro Velvet's song, Still In Love With You, has already divided Eurovision fans and critics.
But while they may not have lit up the top 40, the duo are proud to have topped the physical chart - which includes CD singles, 7-inch vinyl and cassettes - beating David Bowie and Noel Gallagher in the process.
"We went straight in above Noel and I absolutely love Oasis, so that's pretty cool," says Larke.
The pair embarked on a mini European tour ahead of the main event, playing at parties in Amsterdam, Moscow, Riga and London.
The reaction of the Eurovision "superfans" has been an eye-opener.
"At the Amsterdam concert after party, there were queues of people for pictures," says Larke.
"The fans are so in awe, they're literally shaking - you're like their Michael Jackson!"
Nicholas admits it was "strange - it only happens in this Eurovision bubble, because walking down the street people wouldn't know who we are but Eurovision fans are fanatical and so passionate. It's great".
And things have been friendly within the competition - so far.
"You're all in this gang, I don't know if it changes on the night! You're all in it together, everyone's lovely. We've all got the same weight of expectation upon us. It's just a nice atmosphere," says Larke.
Nicholas is philosophical about their chances at the final.
"As long as you know within yourself you've given your all and done the best you can, you can't be disappointed. There's so many factors as to how well you do on the night, you can't predict what's going to happen."
And afterwards?
"Electro Velvet is going to be a very organic thing," Larke muses.
"It will lead us, we'll let it take us where it wants us to go. We're just focused on the competition."
The Eurovision Song Contest 2015 takes place in Vienna, Austria, on Saturday 23 May. The semi-finals can be seen live on BBC Three on Tuesday 19th and Thursday 21st of May at 20:00BST. The grand final will be broadcast live on BBC One and BBC Radio 2.
