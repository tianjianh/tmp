[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Fulham secured a point against Cardiff City courtesy of Kevin McDonald's 86th-minute equaliser.

Ryan Sessegnon put the hosts ahead when he latched on to Sone Aluko's right-wing cross to fire home in the box.
Cardiff levelled with Joe Ralls' long-range drive before Anthony Pilkington scored from 20 yards to put the visitors into the lead.
However, Fulham fought back and were rewarded late on when McDonald equalised with a long-range strike.
Sixteen-year-old defender Sessegnon made an instant impact just before the break, as he scored two minutes after coming on for Floyd Ayite, who was forced off through injury.
Just four days after his full senior debut in Fulham's 1-1 draw against Leeds, Sessegnon became the first player born in 2000 to score in the Championship.
In an entertaining second half, Cardiff could have been out of sight after Pilkington's fine effort as Peter Whittingham hit the woodwork from a free-kick.
But McDonald scored with his first goal for Fulham since his summer move from Wolves to rescue a point for the hosts.
Fulham head coach Slavisa Jokanovic: "Ryan can be good for us. He made a great impact for us.
"He is a real winner and he is just 16 years and three months. He is a real young player.
"I'm sure in the future he can be big part of my squad and help us. He can play in different positions."
Cardiff manager Paul Trollope: "It was a topsy turvy game. We were disappointed with the first half.
"We were passive with and without the ball. We didn't play to our capabilities but we turned it around. Credit must go to the players. They knew they were better than they had showed.
"I'm pleased with the two goals, they were fantastic strikes, but I was disappointed not to have taken the three points as we led going into the 86th minute."
