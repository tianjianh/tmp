An iconic music venue in Newport has been damaged after a fire broke out.

Firefighters were called to TJ's in Clarence Place at 19:43 BST on Saturday, where the ground floor of the three-storey building was alight.
It has been derelict since the nightclub closed in 2010 after the death of owner John Sicolo.
In its heyday, TJs became legendary for hosting some of the world's biggest bands, including Primal Scream, Iron Maiden, The Stone Roses and Oasis.
Nathan Jennings, who is making a film about the venue, said he had contacted the Sicolo family after the fire and they were "devastated".
"It's been part of their lives for 40 years since it opened in 1971," he said.
"It's a sad thing to see."
South Wales Fire and Rescue Service said six fire engines, a hydraulic platform and a water bowser attended the blaze, which was out by 21:19 BST.
