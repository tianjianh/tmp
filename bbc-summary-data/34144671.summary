[SN]TITLE[SN]
Former Barnbow tank factory site to be demolished

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A scheme to demolish the old Vickers tank factory in east Leeds and dig out coal from underneath has been "approved in principle" by councillors.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The plan is for the former Barnbow Works near Cross Gates to be demolished and the coal extracted.
About 2,700 objections have been made, but the scheme was approved with conditions attached.
Councillors said a relief road must be built taking traffic away from Crossgates before any work could start.
The planning panel was told the foundations of both the former tank factory and other buildings, which had previously been demolished at the site, would have to be removed.
Once this work was completed then a 150,000 tonne seam of coal, thought to be about  6ft 6in (2m) deep, would be removed to stabilise the site.
Plans for the site to be subsequently used for housing would then be considered.
In a briefing document the councillors were told: "Demolition of the buildings and breaking up of the concrete is clearly necessary in order to be able to redevelop the site for housing."
It is expected to take two years to construct the relief road to the former tank factory site.
