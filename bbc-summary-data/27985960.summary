Scrum V's 2014-15 ins & outs: Moves that made the headlines

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
As Welsh rugby gears up for a competitive season which starts on Friday, Scrum V recaps the big-name moves and who will feature for the four regions in 2014-15.

Adam Jones became the biggest Welsh rugby headline-stealer with his shock signing for Cardiff Blues after being an Osprey since 2003.
But the British and Irish Lions prop's switch after season-long speculation was not the only move to make fans sit up and take notice.
With a new coach in New Zealander Mark Hammett, Blues also played their part in making Kiwi-born, Welsh-qualified utility back Gareth Anscombe a summer recruit.
Anscombe could become one of the small number of Wales-based players to play under a new Welsh Rugby Union dual contract.
Anscombe's arrival at the Arms Park could offset another major move; that of Wales and Lions full-back Leigh Halfpenny's switch to Toulon.
Another Wales and Lions star, Jonathan Davies, is also playing in France, in his case at Clermont Auvergne.
And having been put off returning to Newport Gwent Dragons by the now-resolved WRU-regions' impasse, lock Luke Charteris moved from relegated Perpignan to Racing Metro.
Utility back James Hook also left the Catalans, in his case for Gloucester, where another former Osprey, hooker Richard Hibbard will ply his trade.
And if losing Wales and Lions hooker Hibbard was not enough of a blow, three other similarly-qualified forwards also departed Liberty Stadium in 2014.
Lock Ian Evans (Bristol), prop Jones and back-five forward Ryan Jones (Bristol) have also left the Swansea-based region.
