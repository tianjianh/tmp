Both men, aged 19, were heavily involved in the GAA.
Drumquin Wolfe Tones manager Ryan McCallion said he was a "well liked" and "vital part" of Drumquin.
"The whole team is devastated, the club is devastated and the whole town is devastated," said Mr McCallion.
"Killian was a big part of Drumquin not only as a footballer but as a person."
He was buried following Mass at St Patrick's Church in Drumquin.
