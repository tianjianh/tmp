[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A nurse who failed to give the correct medicine to patients at an Aberdeenshire care home has been banned from the profession.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Michael Nesbitt was working a night shift at Havencourt care home, in Stonehaven, when he failed to give medication to all the home's residents.
Nesbitt, of Inverurie, was found guilty of misconduct charges following a disciplinary hearing of the Nursing and Midwifery Council.
The incident happened in May last year.
The panel stated: "Mr Nesbitt's actions have put the residents at unwarranted risk of harm, his callous disregard in the proper administration of medication has brought the nursing profession into disrepute.
"He breached one of the fundamental tenets of the nursing profession by falsely recording that he had administered medication when he had not and he has acted dishonestly."
Four Seasons Health Care, which owns the home, previously said no residents "experienced any lasting effects".
