[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
It followed an accident on the A74(M) in Dumfries and Galloway.
Police said "a number" of lorry drivers were seen filming the crash as they passed by. Two were stopped and given fixed penalty notices.
Officers said it was "hard to understand" why "so-called professional drivers" would behave in such a way.
