[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The government must devolve a further £7bn to Greater Manchester if the Northern Powerhouse is to succeed, a council leader has said.

The region has asked the Treasury for control of more budgets in areas including transport and housing.
Tameside Council leader Kieran Quinn said the money would prove the government was "serious" about its plan to boost the North of England economy.
The government said it was "determined" to build a more balanced economy.
Mr Quinn said: "We know [Chancellor] George Osborne's view and we know that there are people within the cabinet who don't like the speed of change.
"This is a very wide-ranging and significant submission to government which absolutely shows Greater Manchester's ambitions.
"If we don't get close to what our ambitions are then I think it will show that in reality this was a pre-election matter to get them over a line."
The Northern Powerhouse is Mr Osborne's plan for boosting the economies of the North of England through devolved powers and greater investment in infrastructure.
In a statement the government said; "We are absolutely determined to end the decades-old gap between the North and South by building a more balanced and resilient economy for working people.
"Greater Manchester broke new ground by being the first area to secure a landmark deal devolving far-reaching powers over transport, housing, planning and policing, and we welcome its new proposals to have an even greater say.
"This will now be considered as part of the spending review process."
The results of the review will be announced on 25 November.
