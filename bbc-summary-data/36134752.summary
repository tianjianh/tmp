The 26-strong team will represent Great Britain at the London Aquatics Centre in Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park.
"This event comes at a perfect time," said British Swimming national performance director Chris Spice.
"A major international event at an iconic 2012 Olympic venue - as a team we couldn't have asked for better."
The swimming programme of the European Aquatics Championships runs from 16-22 May, with the diving events held a week earlier, beginning on 9 May.
The team includes world champions Adam Peaty and James Guy, plus individual world medallists Jazz Carlin and Siobhan-Marie O'Connor among other world, European and Commonwealth medallists.
"This event also provides a wonderful opportunity for the British public to see and support our swimming stars in home waters once again," Spice added.
A 12-strong British team has been selected to compete in the synchronised swimming competition from 9-13 May.
Olympians Olivia Federici and Katie Clark will lead the team as they compete in the duet, which is the event they have secured a quota place for at Rio 2016.
