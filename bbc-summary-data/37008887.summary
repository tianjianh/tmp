[SN]TITLE[SN]
Hampshire residents barred from West Berkshire recycling centres

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
People will be barred from using a recycling centre only a few miles from their home because they live in the wrong council authority.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Hampshire residents were previously permitted to use recycling centres in Newbury and Padworth, Berkshire.
But after Hampshire County Council stopped contributing to its costs, West Berkshire council said it would bar Hampshire residents from using it.
Residents will have to display permits from 26 September.
People living near the Berkshire/Hampshire border will now have to travel to Basingstoke, 10 miles further than some residents previously had to travel.
Chris Webb, of Ecchinswell, Hampshire, said: "I'm very much closer to Newbury than Basingstoke.
"Instead of being able to use the facilities, it becomes quite a logistical headache to get off to Basingstoke."
West Berkshire Council, which saw its residents barred from a Reading tip earlier this year, said the move was to ensure "residents do not have to pay for waste brought to the district from elsewhere".
West Berkshire residents will be given permits, which will have to be shown at tips in Padworth and Newbury.
Previously Hampshire's authority paid Â£200,000 a year for its residents to use the tips, which accounted for 40% of waste taken at Padworth and 20% at Newbury.
Currently no Hampshire residents will be able to use the West Berkshire tips, but a paid-for permit could come into force at a later date.
Councillor Marcus Franks said: "We have said we will look into a chargeable permit, but we need to let our scheme settle down first."
