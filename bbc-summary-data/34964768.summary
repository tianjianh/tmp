The 24-year-old Dubliner has agreed a two-and-a-half-year contract and will formally complete his move when the transfer window reopens in January.
Towell previously had a two-year spell at Celtic, during which he made one first-team appearance for the Bhoys and was twice loaned to Hibernian.
He returned to Ireland in 2013 and has attracted interest from several clubs.
"He had a lot of good options available for his next move - here in England, in Scotland, in Ireland with Dundalk and in Europe - so we are delighted he has decided to join us," Brighton manager Chris Hughton told the club's website.
"I am certain he will be ready for us in January and will be an excellent addition to the squad."
