The interim chief executive of a hospital which was investigated for high death rates has been given the job permanently.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Karen James took on at the role at Tameside General Hospital last July after former chief executive Christine Green quit.
The hospital was one of 14 placed under scrutiny for its high death rates last year.
An inspection in January also found "serious shortfalls" at the site.
Now Ms James has been given the job permanently at the Ashton-under-Lyne hospital after a successful interview.
She said: "The hospital has made huge steps over the last 12 months.
"We still have a long way to go on our path, but I am delighted to have the opportunity to play a role in getting this hospital firmly back on its feet and delivering the kind of healthcare the local community deserve."
Denton and Reddish MP Andrew Gwynne praised the appointment, and said Ms James had made "a significant difference to the staff and patients."
He added: "I am very pleased that she has been appointed on a permanent basis, so she can finish the journey of improvement the hospital is now on."
