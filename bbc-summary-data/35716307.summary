World T20: England batting "power" excites former captain Collingwood

England's "powerful" batting line-up gives them a strong chance of winning the World Twenty20, according to former winning captain Paul Collingwood.

Skipper Eoin Morgan, Ben Stokes, Jos Buttler, Alex Hales and Joe Root were part of successes against New Zealand, Australia and Pakistan in 2015.
Sam Billings, Jason Roy and James Vince complete coach Trevor Bayliss' options.
"With players like that, you'll always have a chance to win major tournaments," Collingwood said.
He told BBC Newcastle: "The fielding is world-class, the batting line-up is powerful right down to nine or 10. There are good things happening in this team."
Collingwood lifted the trophy as England skipper in 2010, when they beat Australia in the final in Barbados.
He will travel to India as part of the coaching staff and, although defeats by South Africa in both one-day and T20 cricket tempered the optimism among England supporters, he believes that should be regarded as "a bit of a blip".
The 39-year-old added: "Everybody has seen the way white-ball cricket has been going over the past year, it's been very exciting.
"We need to realise the good things they've been doing the past year, the way they've played their cricket, these guys are very much athletes now.
"If they play like they did against Australia or New Zealand they can beat anyone."
Hampshire batsman and captain Vince is also confident that England have the talent to be strong challengers.
The 24-year-old did not feature on the recent tour of South Africa, but he was part of the Karachi Kings team which reached the semi-finals of the Pakistan Super League in February.
"Although the South Africa series didn't quite go to plan, the way the guys have been playing their one-day cricket and Twenty20 cricket over the last 12 months or so gives us a real chance," he told BBC Radio Solent.
"We'll just go out there and play the way we can do, and if we do that we'll go somewhere."
