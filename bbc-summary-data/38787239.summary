One US soldier died and three were injured.
Several Apache helicopters were reported to have taken part in the operation in al-Baida province.
Three al-Qaeda leaders were among those killed in a battle lasting 45 minutes in a village in Yakla district. Earlier reports suggested a higher death toll.
US drones have carried out periodic attacks on al-Qaeda in Yemen.
Local sources earlier said 41 militants and 16 civilians were killed.
A provincial official said the helicopters targeted a hospital, school and mosque.
Leading al-Qaeda figure Abdul Raouf al-Dhahab was among those killed in the night-time operation in which drones were also used.
Al-Qaeda has taken advantage of the chaos caused by the conflict in Yemen to entrench its presence in the south and south-east.
For the past two years, the country has been embroiled in fighting between forces loyal to the internationally recognised president, backed by a Saudi-led coalition, and Shia Houthi rebels.
Iran rejects accusations of supporting the rebels.
This would be the first such raid since President Donald Trump took office on 20 January.
