[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A Fraserburgh nursery has been told to make "swift" improvements following an inspection which raised concerns about systems designed to protect children.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Peek-a-Boo Nursery has been served with a formal improvement notice.
An unannounced inspection had been carried out last month and the Care Inspectorate said it was concerned that insufficient progress had been made following a visit earlier this year.
Management have been given until the end of May to make improvements.
A spokesman for Peek-a-Boo Nursery said: "We are naturally very disappointed with the findings following the Care Inspectorate's recent visit.
"We will continue to invest in staff training, new resources and to seek external support, to bring the nursery up to the required operating standards and we are encouraged that the Care Inspectorate and Aberdeenshire Council are willing to work with us to remedy this situation.
"We want to assure all parents that we remain absolutely committed to resolving all outstanding areas of concern and would like to thank them for their continued support."
The statement added: "We will work hard to meet the requirements of the Care Inspectorate within the 29 May timescale."
