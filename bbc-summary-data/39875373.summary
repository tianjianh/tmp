Championship play-off final: Vote for your most memorable moment

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Few games in English football have provided more drama over the past 30 years than some of those in the play-offs.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
There have been changes in format and final venues since their inception in 1987, but they are now a staple of the football calendar that offer delirium and desolation in equal measure.
To mark the 30-year anniversary of the play-offs, BBC Sport is asking you to vote on your most memorable Championship play-off final moment.
The online vote will take place during our live text coverage of the 2017 final between Huddersfield Town and Reading at Wembley on Monday.
Voting will start at 13:00 BST and end at 17:30 BST, and we will announce the winner shortly afterwards.
Here are the eight options to choose from...
1993: Swindon Town 4-3 Leicester City
Swindon had won the second-tier play-offs three years earlier, but were denied promotion to the top flight having admitted 36 breaches of league rules - 35 of them concerning illegal payments made to players.
They were back at Wembley in 1993 under player-manager Glenn Hoddle, who scored the first goal as Swindon went 3-0 up against Leicester.
Back came the Foxes. Julian Joachim, Steve Walsh and Steve Thompson all scored in a 12-minute spell to level the match at 3-3, and it took a late penalty from Paul Bodin to secure Swindon's promotion.
Four days later, Hoddle resigned to take charge of Chelsea.
1995: Bolton Wanderers 4-3 Reading (aet)
The English league structure was being reorganised in 1994-95, so only one team was promoted automatically from the second tier that season.
Reading, who had finished second in the table behind champions Middlesbrough, were 2-0 ahead after 12 minutes against Bolton and also had a penalty saved just before half-time.
Wanderers pegged them back in the closing stages, as Owen Coyle and substitute Fabian de Freitas sent the game into extra-time.
Mixu Paatelainen and De Freitas' second extended their advantage, although Jimmy Quinn fired in Reading's third before Bolton's promotion was confirmed.
1996: Leicester City 2-1 Crystal Palace (aet)
Steve Claridge developed a habit of scoring big goals for Leicester City. Less than a year before his 1997 League Cup final winner for the Foxes, he had sent them back up to the top division at the expense of Crystal Palace.
Garry Parker's penalty cancelled out Palace's opener from Andy Roberts, and the game was deadlocked until the final minute of extra-time, when Claridge found the corner with a shot from 20 yards.
Even Leicester manager Martin O'Neill had been expecting a shoot-out. Seconds before Claridge's winner, he had substituted goalkeeper Kevin Poole for giant Australian Zeljko Kalac, believing he would be a better bet at saving penalties.
Kalac did not touch the ball during his brief cameo at Wembley.
1997: Crystal Palace 1-0 Sheffield United
Crystal Palace got over the disappointment of their 1996 defeat by Leicester to go up via the play-offs in 1997 - and in similarly dramatic circumstances.
This time it was Sheffield United on the wrong end of some late Wembley drama, as Palace captain David Hopkin curled a shot into the top corner from 25 yards in the final minute of normal time to seal a 1-0 victory for the Eagles.
Palace have won four second-tier play-off finals, more than any other club.
1998: Charlton Athletic 4-4 Sunderland (aet, 7-6 pens)
Only two second-tier play-off finals have been settled by penalty shoot-outs - Birmingham beat Norwich in 2002, four years after Charlton had defeated Sunderland.
Clive Mendonca's superbly taken hat-trick for Charlton would have grabbed the headlines in any other year, but that was only part of the story.
Sunderland led three times but the Addicks would not be shaken off. It was 4-4 after extra-time, which meant penalties.
After 13 successful spot-kicks, Michael Gray's tame effort was saved by Sasa Ilic and Charlton were promoted at the end of a remarkable final.
2008: Hull City 1-0 Bristol City
Dean Windass saved one of his best goals for one of the biggest stages in English football, as he sent his hometown club Hull City into the top division for the first time in their history.
The 2008 final was a big occasion for the Tigers and their opponents Bristol City, who had gone 28 years without top-flight football and were one win away from a second successive promotion.
Hull-born Windass settled the contest with a stunning 20-yard volley from Fraizer Campbell's cross - one of the finest goals ever scored in a play-off final.
2011: Swansea City 4-2 Reading
No Welsh club had tasted Premier League football until Swansea City won promotion to the top flight in 2011.
They made a fast start against Reading and led 3-0 at half-time thanks to Scott Sinclair's double and a third goal from Stephen Dobbie.
Reading pulled it back to 3-2 and Jem Karacan hit the post as they searched for an equaliser, but Sinclair converted his second penalty of the game to complete his hat-trick and send Brendan Rodgers' Swansea up.
Mendonca, Sinclair and Preston's Jermaine Beckford (for Preston in the 2015 League One final) are the only players to have scored three times in a Wembley play-off decider.
2014: QPR 1-0 Derby County
QPR secured an immediate return to the Premier League with yet another last-minute play-off final winner against Derby.
Rangers played most of the second half with 10 men after Gary O'Neil was sent off for cynically bringing down Johnny Russell, who was bearing down on goal.
Derby had dominated the match before O'Neil's dismissal and there looked to be only one winner until Zamora's last-minute intervention.
Zamora, who had scored West Ham's winner against Preston in 2005, capitalised on a poor clearance by Rams defender Richard Keogh and, with QPR's only shot on target in the match, found the corner from 15 yards to guarantee promotion.
