[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
There are hopes government intervention will lead to workers at the Teesside steel plant where production has been suspended being paid on Friday.

Northern Powerhouse minister and MP for Stockton South, James Wharton, said it was doing all it could to help and "there were reasons to be hopeful".
However, the union said plant owner SSI had not confirmed whether workers would receive any money.
A "Save our Steel" rally was held earlier in Redcar.
The plant has been hit by falling prices and competition from cheap Chinese steel.
Mr Wharton said: "It's very difficult because of the restrictions on what we are able to say publicly, but I know people are quite understandably desperate for some news, especially if it's some positive news.
"I think we can be very hopeful that a solution will be delivered to ensure people receive pay.
"Of course that leaves the broader issue of SSI and its future hanging in the balance, and I am very concerned about where that might go and the challenges that the company faces.
"But, in the immediate term, that pressing need to ensure people get the payment that they quite rightly expect, I can confirm that the government is fully aware of it, we're fully engaged with it, and we're working very hard to resolve it and there are reasons to be hopeful."
Community union chairman, Paul Warren, said: "For the sake of all the workers and their families, I hope Mr Wharton has got it right.
"We must now keep up that pressure and ensure that a deal to secure the future of the Redcar steelworks is reached.
"Steel making here is at a minute to midnight but the fire is still alight."
