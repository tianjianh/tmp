The pictures were taken in Monument Valley, Arizona, and at the Trona Pinnacles and Red Rock Canyon in California.
The glowing fireball resembling a meteor was a giant "honey moon" passing in time-lapse across the sky.
The footage is made up of over 10,000 thousand still photographs, which were put together by film-makers Gavin Heffernan and Harun MehmedinoviÄ‡.
