Safe standing: Government remains 'unconvinced' by case

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The government "remains unconvinced" by the case to reintroduce safe standing to Premier League and Championship grounds in England.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Scottish champions Celtic opened a standing section at Celtic Park last summer, which a report says will continue to be monitored.
Premier League clubs agreed further talks on the possibility of introducing safe standing at grounds in November.
A change to allow standing in England would need a change in legislation.
Top flight and Championship stadiums have to be all-seater after terraces were outlawed in the aftermath of the 1989 Hillsborough disaster.
Ninety-six Liverpool fans standing on the terraces died during the Reds' FA Cup semi-final with Nottingham Forest at Sheffield Wednesday's ground.
The report - an annual update to the Department for Culture, Media and Sport's 'Sporting Future: A New Strategy for an Active Nation' - also highlighted that the Premier League had honoured their commitment to at least double their investment in grassroots football with at least Â£100m a year of funding.
