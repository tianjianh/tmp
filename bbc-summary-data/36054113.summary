Private investment firm Ennismore said improvements and upgrades were being made throughout the Perthshire hotel.
The project includes a new bar in the Dormy Clubhouse and refurbishment of the hotel's main bar.
Ennismore plans to create public spaces that "reflect Gleneagles' distinctly Scottish identity, but with a contemporary feel".
Designers involved in the initiative include David Collins Studio, Timorous Beasties, Macaulay Sinclair and Goddard Littlefair.
Work is expected to be completed by early summer.
The hotel and golf resort was bought by Ennismore last July in a deal thought to have been worth about Â£150m.
Ennismore chief executive Sharan Pasricha said: "We're approaching the refurbishment with bold and creative decisions while respecting the hotel's history and building on its remarkable heritage.
"It's an organic progression - evolution, not revolution - and will ensure the iconic Gleneagles brand remains synonymous with luxury, and the hotel maintains its position among the leading hotels of the world."
He added: "When Gleneagles first opened its doors in 1924, it was dubbed as the 'Palace in the Glens' and our aim is to surpass these glory days.
"We look forward to introducing our guests to the new spaces and continuing to provide them with a five-star experience in a setting that is effortlessly stylish and luxurious."
