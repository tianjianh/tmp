[SN]TITLE[SN]
Barnsley vicar guilty of stealing £24k of church funds

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A vicar has been found guilty of stealing £24,000 of church funds meant for weddings and funerals.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Simon Reynolds, of Farnham, Surrey, did not return to Sheffield Crown Court for the verdict and a warrant has been issued for his arrest.
The money was paid to him by bereaved families and engaged couples while he was at All Saints Church in Darton, near Barnsley.
The judge said a custodial sentence was inevitable.
Reynolds, of Upper Church Lane, had denied four counts of theft between 2007 and 2013.
He was in court earlier but did not return for the verdict.
Archdeacon of Pontefract Peter Townley said: "We deeply regret any further pain caused to those families who paid fees to Simon for funerals and our hope is that this conviction now affords some peace.
"It is of course a matter of deep disappointment when a member of clergy acts in anything other than an exemplary manner."
The trial had previously heard money from three of the thefts should have been sent to the Wakefield Diocesan Board of Finance for marriages, funerals and graveyard memorials.
The fourth count of theft relates to payments for monuments that should have gone to the parochial church council.
The court was told an investigation showed Reynolds had only passed on a fraction of what he should.
Archdeacon of Surrey Stuart Beake said Reynolds remained suspended and disciplinary action would be decided after he was sentenced.
