Lafayette police said they responded to a call from the cinema at about 19:30 local time (01:30 GMT).
The ambulance service told reporters two people were killed, including the gunman.
Lafayette is a city of about 120,000 people located roughly 55 miles (90 km) southwest of Baton Rouge.
Witnesses report that the gunman began shooting about 20 minutes into a screening of the film Trainwreck at the Grand Theatre.
"We heard a loud pop we thought was a firecracker," Katie Domingue told local newspaper The Advertiser.
She said the gunman, who appeared to be "an older white man", fired about six shots.
Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal said he was on his way to the scene, tweeting: "Please say a prayer for the victims at Grand Theatre and their families."
