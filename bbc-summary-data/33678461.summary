Spanish Armada: Sligo coast 'treasure' is being restored by Dublin museum

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Under the shadow of Ben Bulben in the Dartry Mountains of County Sligo lies the Streedagh beach peninsula.

Up the coast and visible from Streedagh's sands is Classiebawn Castle, the home of Lord Mountbatten before he was murdered by the IRA.
But out at sea are the wrecks of Spanish Armada ships, La Lavia, La Juliana and the Santa Maria de Vison.
All three were destroyed in fierce storms on 21 September 1588, while returning to Spain after their failed attempt to invade England.
In February, after another bout of stormy weather, local man Declan Bruen made a chance discovery.
"I was out walking on the beach as I do most days, when I spotted a piece of timber," he said.
"We brought it in and it turned out to be part of the rudder from The Juliana."
Declan's discovery re-sparked interest from the underwater archaeology unit and the National Museum in Dublin.
Because of the danger that the bad weather could force the wrecks further out to sea, divers immediately began to explore the area.
In all, nine cannon and other items in remarkable condition were discovered and brought ashore.
The artefacts were brought to the National Museum in Collin's Barracks in Dublin where other Armada cannon are on display.
It is hoped they will soon go on show to the public.
Lar Joye, the museum's curator of military history, believes the finds are a real treasure trove.
"What's great about the ones found recently is that there are so many of them," he said, "And they are in excellent condition.
"Once those involved in conservation in the National Museum start working on them all the fine details on the cannons will survive."
Not all those on board the Spanish ships perished in the fierce storms off the Sligo coast.
Franciso De Cuellar one of the survivors at Streedagh, wrote about his experiences.
He described the sea as reaching "the heavens", drowning more than 1,000 men over an hour-long period and leaving barely 300 survivors.
Eddie O'Gorman, a local historian and the chairman of the Grange and Armada Development Association, says De Cuellar landed at a time when local Irish clans, like the O'Rourkes, were daggers drawn with the the English who were based in the nearby Sligo town.
"What a swashbuckler that man was", he adds, "He entertained chieftains like McClancy and O'Rourke who wanted to recruit him to their side so that he could train up their soldiers in the art of continental warfare.
"But he was determined to get back to Spain and eventually he did through Scotland."
But before that return, he sought refuge in an abbey close to Streedagh, but found that the "Lutheran English" as he called them had got there before him.
The abbey was in ruins, the monks had fled and 12 Spaniards had been hanged.
The local community in Grange now want to establish an interpretive centre to tell De Cuellar's story and that of the Spanish wrecks.
But Donal Gilroy, a local campaigner, says there's more to north Sligo than the Armada.
"We want to make it a centre for the culturally-curious tourist", he said.
"We want to promote not just the Armada, but also Lisadell House, Ben Bulben, Mullaghmore and Lord Mountbatten and all the other places of interest in the area."
In September there will be an ecumenical event on Streedagh beach to remember the 1100 men who lost their lives far from home in stormy weather off the wild Irish coast.
