[SN]TITLE[SN]
Ecclefechan farmer fined after grandson hurt in farm accident

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A farmer has been fined Â£2,000 following an accident in which his nine-year-old grandson was seriously injured.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Dumfries Sheriff Court heard that Thomas Raine suffered a fractured skull and a punctured lung when he was struck by a tractor.
He has made a full recovery since the accident in April 2011.
Brian Blacklock, 65, of Middlebie, near Ecclefechan, admitted contravening the Health and Safety at Work Act.
The court was told that Thomas and his 12-year-old brother, David, had been playing in a field where Blacklock was working when the accident happened.
He had allowed them in the field at the family farm at Middlebie, even though he was driving a tractor with rollers attached.
The farmer has since retired.
