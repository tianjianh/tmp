[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Two 17-year-old men were sitting on a bench near an underpass when the thieves threatened them with a nunchuk.
They were robbed of their mobile phones at about 22:45 on Monday in St Margaret's Drive in Dunfermline.
The thieves are white and were wearing masks with a skull design. Both spoke with Glaswegian accents.
DC Conrad Musgrave said: "Neither victim was injured during this robbery but were understandably shaken.
"Anyone who was in the area at the time of the incident and remembers seeing anything suspicious is asked to contact police immediately."
Nunchuks consist of two pieces of wood joined together by a short chain.
