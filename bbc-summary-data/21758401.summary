Alan Sugar believed a businesswoman who won TV's The Apprentice was trying to damage his reputation, an employment tribunal has heard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Judgement has been reserved in the case of Stella English, 34, who is claiming constructive dismissal from Lord Sugar's IT firm, Viglen.
Ms English, who earned Â£100,000 a year, claimed she had no real role at the company.
The decision from the tribunal panel is expected within a month.
Earlier, Lord Sugar told the East London Tribunal Centre he had no case to answer.
He said Ms English was effectively blackmailing him.
Lord Sugar's representative Seamus Sweeney, said: "The claimant has, in the eyes of Lord Sugar, deliberately courted the media with a view of damaging his reputation."
He said Ms English had "sold her story" to the press several times and he accused her of being a "headline-grabber", deliberately sensationalising aspects of her evidence.
Lord Sugar, who gave evidence to the hearing last week, had admitted "losing his cool" when being questioned.
Mr Sweeney said: "Lord Sugar has maintained his position, his dignity, until he comes here.
"He can be forgiven in these circumstances for reacting passionately in his cross-examination because he feels wronged."
The tribunal heard Ms English resigned from Viglen in May 2011 and then felt pressurised into taking up a new position at Lord Sugar's internet set-top box company YouView.
Lord Sugar said he was trying to help her out by offering her a new position as she had complained of being "desperate for money".
He told the hearing there was no full-time position available at YouView and it had been explained that contractual work might be possible instead.
