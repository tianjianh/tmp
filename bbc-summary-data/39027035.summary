[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Response officers PCs David Stamp, Hugh Flanagan and Caroline Irwin face a series of alleged professional standard breaches in relation to the incident in March 2014.
The trio had attended the scene of a car crash caused by ice on the A413 in Buckinghamshire, but are accused of failing to take appropriate action.
A misconduct hearing started on Monday.
At 04:52 GMT on 4 March 2014, driver Martin Kendall phoned Thames Valley Police to report he had crashed his car on the A413 between Wendover and Great Missenden.
PC Stamp, based at Amersham Police Station, was joined at the scene by his colleagues.
It is alleged the officers left the scene at about 05:26 after concluding the accident had been caused by ice.
Shortly before 05:54 there was a fatal crash very close to the location of Mr Kendall's accident, again allegedly caused by ice.
The public hearing, taking place in Newbury, is set to run until 3 March.
