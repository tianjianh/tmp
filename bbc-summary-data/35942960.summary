A 56-year-old woman has been found dead in the same house which was the scene of a murder 10 years ago.

The woman was found in her home in Kintail Court in Inverness at about 16:45 on Thursday.
It is the same terraced bungalow where the body of hairdresser Ilene O'Connor, 39, was found in 2006.
Brian Grant, 50, was jailed in 2007 for beating Ms O'Connor to death and burying her body in the garden.
It is understood the deceased, described as a "quiet and private woman", was found with some injuries and that there was blood on the floor.
She is thought to have lived alone in the terraced bungalow in the Hilton housing estate of Inverness.
Police Scotland have not said if they are currently looking for anyone in connection with the death which they described as "unexplained".
The garden of the house was taped off soon after she was discovered and uniformed officers were stationed outside overnight.
Forensic experts arrived early on Friday morning and remained for several hours.
One neighbour said: "She was a quiet and private woman. Although she had been here for a few years, she didn't say much. She was a bit of a loner.
"She would come out her door and rather than walk past her immediate neighbours, she would walk across the road to the opposite pavement to continue her journey.
"She would often walk into town and could be seen sometimes picking up items off the street. I didn't hear or see anything recently which would have made me suspicious. It is sad and tragic that another woman should die in that house."
A police spokeswoman said: "Police Scotland were made aware of the sudden death of a woman in the Kintail Court area of Hilton at around 4:45pm yesterday.
"The death is currently being treated as unexplained and enquiries to establish the full circumstances are ongoing.
"No further information is available at this time."
