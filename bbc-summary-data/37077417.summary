Jairo Medina, 62, a professional carer from Chelsea, was found early on Friday morning by a person walking by who then called the police. Once officers got there, Mr Medina had died.
A post mortem examination did not find a cause of death, but it showed that he had been assaulted.
Officers are investigating it as a murder. An area about the size of two football pitches was cordoned off.
The scene was near the mosaic to commemorate The Reformers' Tree in Hyde Park.
The Met Police would like to hear from anyone who may have seen something suspicious in the area between the evening of Thursday 11 August and the early hours of Friday.
