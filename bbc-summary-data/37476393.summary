Last week, it was announced the 74-year-old, who was born in Colwyn Bay, Conwy, had been diagnosed with a severe variant of dementia.
The condition - primary progressive aphasia - affects his ability to communicate.
Mr Jones will be honoured with an outstanding contribution award at the ceremony in Cardiff.
He was a member of the legendary comedy troupe with Terry Gilliam, John Cleese, Eric Idle, Michael Palin and the late Graham Chapman.
He directed Monty Python's Life of Brian and The Meaning of Life and co-directed Monty Python and the Holy Grail with Gilliam.
Hannah Raybould, director of Bafta Cymru, said: "We are very much looking forward to celebrating the work of Terry Jones during the ceremony with a look back at his work from 1969 to the present day."
Jones's spokesman said: "Terry is proud and honoured to be recognised in this way and is looking forward to the celebrations."
Michael Palin will also attend the ceremony at St David's Hall.
