Neighbours Beadman and Harlow, both of George Avenue, are alleged to have held Kayleigh against her will at Harlow's home between about 21:00 BST on Saturday, November 14 and 03:00 on Sunday, November 15.
Witnesses Samuel Green and Amy Dearden, who live together near Ibstock's Sence Valley Forest Park, told the court they heard a loud scream in the early hours of November 15.
Mr Green said he had gone to bed just before midnight.
"I was lying there. I can't be 100% sure how long I lay there and then all of a sudden I heard a loud scream, someone screaming 'mummy'," Mr Green said.
"It sounded like a female to me, and if I'm honest, whoever it was sounded frightened."
Ms Dearden said the scream of "mummy" sounded so close, she thought someone was in her garden.
"It sounded like a young child. Sam opened the window and shouted but nobody replied," she said.
The court also heard a man with a bloodied face was seen near to where Kayleigh's body was found.
In a police interview played to Nottingham Crown Court, Harlow claimed Kayleigh had drunk a bottle of wine after being dropped off by her dad at Ibstock leisure centre the previous Friday because she was "nervous" about meeting him.
Harlow said Kayleigh had drunk "a considerable amount of vodka" in his flat while he and Beadman had gone to the shops to get more alcohol.
On Sunday morning, Harlow said he woke up feeling "quite groggy" and did not know where Kayleigh was, although her shoes were still in his flat.
He then went to see Beadman.
"He [Beadman] had scratches all over his face which he didn't have on Friday night," Harlow said.
"He said he had got them at work, he is a landscape gardener.  I didn't think anything of it at the time.
"I asked Stephen Beadman if he had seen her leave he said no."
The trial continues.
