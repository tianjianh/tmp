Yussuf, 20, has signed a one-year deal with the Imps after struggled with a groin injury in his second season at the Pirelli Stadium last term.
Nolan, 21, who spent two seasons with the Conference North-bound Stockport, has also agreed a one-year contract.
Meanwhile, midfielder Alan Power has signed a new two-year deal at the club.
The 25-year-old, who was named the Imps' player of the season this year, has scored 15 times in 90 appearances since joining on a free transfer in 2011.
Lincoln manager Gary Simpson said it took a late-night dash to Manchester to seal the on-again, off-again deal for Nolan.
I was back to Manchester at 11 o'clock last night to sign him
"It looked like the whole thing was dead in the water yesterday [Wednesday]," he told BBC Radio Lincolnshire.
"First, I thought I had done the deal last week when he came to see us, so he took the weekend to think about it.
"He gave us the decision on Monday, and I was going to Manchester to sign the boy when I got a phone call to explain that a big Conference club had put a financial package to him that was way above anything that we could get near.
"Then, after he spoke to that club and his agent, I got another phone call from the lad to say that for footballing reasons and his career he thought we were a better option and decided to resurrect talks.
"And so I was back to Manchester at 11:00 BST last night [Wednesday] to sign him."
On the signing of Yussuf, Simpson added: "He is a young boy that has had quite a few injuries, and while he is a bit of a gamble, if it pays off he could be a fantastic asset."
