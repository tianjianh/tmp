The Dons are, however, without injured trio Jonny Hayes, Mark Reynolds and Ryan Jack.
Partick Thistle welcome defender Mustapha Dumbuya back from injury for the match.
On-loan Crawley winger Jason Banton could be available but Sean Welsh, Ryan Scully, Stuart Bannigan and Gary Fraser all remain out injured.
Aberdeen assistant manager Tony Docherty: "It's a Partick Thistle side in fine form. I watched them against Dundee the other night and it was another fantastic victory for them.
"They have won their last four matches comfortably without conceding a goal and scored six. They are riding high and full of confidence, and we realise we need to be at our best to beat Partick Thistle.
"They aren't losing a lot of goals so we need to be patient in our build-up and we need to be clinical. When opportunities arise we have to take them, and that's something perhaps we can learn from the other night's defeat."
Partick Thistle manager Alan Archibald: "We'll be tested to the max come Sunday. But we've defended really well in the last few weeks. We've competed well enough against Aberdeen this season. We've got enough belief that we can go and do it."
