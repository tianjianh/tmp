Cahill, who joined the club last February and signed a contract extension in November, said his exit was "heartbreaking".
The Australian said he was not part of new coach Gregorio Manzano's plans.
"This is very sad especially after what I feel I have helped to build in Shanghai Shenhua on and off the park," said Cahill, 36.
Clubs in the Chinese Super League have spent more than £200m during their current transfer window, which closes on 26 February, with the new season starting in March.
Jiangsu Suning have spent more than £63m on midfielders Alex Teixeira and Ramires, while Jackson Martinez has made a £31m move to Guangzhou Evergrande from Atletico Madrid.
Earlier this month, Cahill told a Fox Sports Australia panel show that the league was "pretty much like a revolving door", adding "you see a lot of players coming in and a lot of players going".
He said: "The choices that players are making are not about football like it was in my day. They're purely about personal gains and it depends what you want as an individual.
"Is it going to help players? No. Is it going to be big for the country? Yes."
Cahill posted on his Instagram on Tuesday: "Just thinking about saying goodbye to my team-mates and especially the amazing fans is heartbreaking.
"I will always think about what could have been for us as a club in 2016."
Cahill, who can play as a forward or an attacking midfielder, spent six years with Millwall before joining Everton in 2004, and moved to Major League Soccer with New York Red Bulls in 2012. He has scored 45 goals in 88 games for Australia.
