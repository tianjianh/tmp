Ebbsfleet United football club delays stadium revamp

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A multi-million pound revamp of a football stadium in Kent has been delayed until next year.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Ebbsfleet United has been granted planning permission for a new Â£3.5m main stand along Stonebridge Road.
The Liam Daish Stand, constructed mainly of timber, will be the first part of the ground to be demolished.
The club said it had a number of high-profile games in the upcoming season and construction would be deferred until the end of it.
The new stadium will increase capacity from just over 4,000 to 6,000.
