The 25-year-old, who finished top in Wednesday's qualifying, scored 87.33 behind winner and home favourite Oystein Braaten (91.33) and USA's Nick Goepper (89:00).
Woods said: "To be given the opportunity to compete at the X Games and show myself and everyone what I can do, has always been, and always will be my dream."
The 25-year-old will compete in the big air elimination on Friday afternoon, with the finals on Saturday before he heads to the World Freestyle Championships in Spain.
He won gold in the ski big air at the X Games in Aspen, Colorado, last month.
Snowboarding big air will make its Olympic debut next year in Pyeongchang.
