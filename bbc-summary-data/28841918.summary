[SN]TITLE[SN]
Disabled parking abuse laws passed

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
New laws to crack down on drivers who abuse disabled parking have been passed by the Scottish Parliament.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The legislation aims to deal with the hundreds of drivers said to be misusing blue badges, by giving councils powers to confiscate and cancel them.
The Disabled Persons' Parking Badges Bill was brought forward by SNP MSP Dennis Robertson, who is blind.
He said abuse of the system was a growing problem and had become "unacceptable".
There are 245,000 legitimate blue badge holders in Scotland, and Holyrood's local government committee said misuse of the blue badge scheme was having a "major impact" on the lives of people who rely on disabled parking spaces.
In addition, research by agency Transport Scotland said 83% of legitimate badge holders had encountered misuse.
Misuse of a blue badge is already an offence, but enforcement powers currently lie with the police.
The legislation will come into force next year.
