The driver of the bin lorry that crashed in Glasgow killing six people has been arrested over claims he drove while banned.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Harry Clarke, 58, is accused of driving a car on 20 September despite losing his licence for medical reasons.
Mr Clarke blacked out while driving a council lorry which crashed in Glasgow city centre on 22 December last year.
He had previously fainted while working as a bus driver but failed disclose it when he joined the council.
A Police Scotland spokesman said: "A 58-year-old man was arrested in connection with alleged traffic offences. A report will be sent to the procurator fiscal."
Erin McQuade, 18, her grandparents Jack Sweeney, 68, and his 69-year-old wife Lorraine, all from Dumbarton, died in the bin lorry crash in the city's Queen Street and George Square.
Stephenie Tait, 29, and Jacqueline Morton, 51, both from Glasgow, and Gillian Ewing, 52, from Edinburgh, were also killed when the truck mounted the pavement before crashing into the side of the Millennium Hotel.
A further 15 people were injured.
A fatal accident inquiry (FAI) into the deaths heard DVLA officials withdrew Mr Clarke's car licence for 12 months and banned him from driving HGVs for 10 years on 25 June this year.
