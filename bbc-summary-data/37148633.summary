Lauren Heath, 20, was struck after pushing her daughter's pram out of harm's way on Basingstoke Road in Reading in April.
One-year-old Millie - who sustained minor head injuries in the crash - is now being cared for by Lauren's family.
Cousin Amy Lane said they hoped to "make Lauren proud".
The event at Reading's Rivermoor Stadium included football matches, a raffle and stalls.
Ms Lane said: "This is all so that we can give Millie the future she deserves and make Lauren and the family proud.
"It's been extremely hard, there's not a day gone by when Lauren is not mentioned. She's a hero, and we're so proud of her.
"We want to give Millie the best start in life. It's going to go into a trust fund and when she's old enough it'll be there for her to use."
An online fundraising page to pay for funeral arrangements and support the trust fund for Millie has raised almost Â£23,000.
An inquest into Lauren's death is due to take place on 31 August.
