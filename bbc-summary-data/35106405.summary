Officials released a picture of the latest works with workers accessing the shear fault on scaffolding erected around the northeast main tower leg.
The bridge has been closed to all traffic since 4 December after a crack was discovered in a truss under the carriageway.
Engineers are working towards having the Forth Road Bridge open to traffic by the first Monday in January.
Amey is also taking preventative action on another seven similar locations on the bridge to prevent issues from arising there, and installing structural monitoring systems.
It is estimated the work will cost about Â£2m to complete.
Other maintenance is also being carried out while the bridge is closed, including line painting and decking work, which authorities said would reduce the need for future closures and restrictions.
