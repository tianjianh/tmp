They are particularly keen to speak to passengers on a number 18 bus which was going along London Road at the time of Saturday's attack.
The 19-year-old received serious injuries in the incident which involved several men and possibly a woman.
Police originally said the incident happened at about 16:45 but have since learned it was about 17:40.
The fight took place near the junction of Abercromby Street and Arcadia Street. The victim was later found slumped on a bench in Templeton Street.
Police said the number 18 bus was travelling east towards Greenhills at the time.
Several passengers were on board and, although some have already spoken to police, detectives still want to speak to the others.
Officers are continuing to review CCTV images.
Det Sgt Robert Bowie said: "This man was found by members of the public on a bench opposite a playpark in Templeton Street, however, our inquiries have established that he was involved in the disturbance in London Road.
"It's imperative we trace the people involved in that disturbance which has left a young man seriously injured.
"In particular, I am appealing particularly to the bus passengers who haven't contacted us yet to get in touch.
"This is a busy area and there would have been plenty of people around at the time who may have vital information. I would urge them to contact us."
