AFC Fylde 2-2 Boreham Wood

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
AFC Fylde started the season with a creditable draw at home to Boreham Wood following their promotion to the fifth tier.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The party seemed set to carry on when Boreham's Danny Woodards headed Zaine Francis-Angol's dangerous cross into his own net.
The Wood's renowned fighting spirit from last season, however, kicked in on the stroke of half-time when Ricky Shakes nodded Angelo Balanta's cross past Rhys Taylor.
Luke Garrard's men continued their momentum into the second half and from Balanta's ball, Kane Smith's awkward looking header sailed in to hand the away side the lead.
But Fylde substitutes Jonny Smith and Henry Jones combined well for the former to level the scores and earn his side a point.
