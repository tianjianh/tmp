New Manchester City forward Raheem Sterling scored three minutes into his debut in a friendly against Roma at the MCG in Melbourne on Tuesday.

The 20-year-old, who joined City for Â£49m from Liverpool on 14 July, ran through on goal before finishing.
Sterling started on the left side of a front three that included David Silva and teenage forward Kelechi Iheanacho before being substituted at half-time.
Iheanacho also scored in a game City won 5-4 on penalties after a 2-2 draw.
The game was City's first in the International Champions Cup tournament in which they face Real Madrid on Friday.
Sterling, who became the most expensive English player ever when he made the move from Liverpool to City, slipped on the ball after 49 seconds of the game and later had a strong call for a penalty turned down.
He appeared to be fouled inside the area by Alessandro Florenzi, but the referee waved play on.
Miralem Pjanic equalised for Roma with a stunning long-range strike before Iheanacho pounced on a poor Ashley Cole back pass to regain the lead for City early in the second half.
Roma's Adem Ljajic curled home a free-kick with three minutes remaining to take the game to penalties, where Joe Hart made two saves and also scored to give City the win.
