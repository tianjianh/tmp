Newry-based firm MJM Marine almost doubles its pre-tax profits

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Newry-based fit-out company MJM Marine almost doubled its pre-tax profits to £1.9m in 2014.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Turnover at the firm rose by almost 40% from £29m to £39m.
MJM specialises in fitting-out cruise ships and during the year completed its largest ever contract.
That was the fit out of one of the world's biggest cruise ships, Royal Caribbean's Oasis of the Seas.
The company was established by Brian McConville in Rathfriland, County Down, in 1983.
It is now based at Carnbane in Newry and directly employs about 150 people.
At the start of 2014, the MJM Group bought the assets of Mivan, the Antrim-based construction and fit-out firm, which had gone into administration.
MJM has maintained the Mivan brand and employs more than 100 people at the Antrim operation.
