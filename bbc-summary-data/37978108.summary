Two video assistant referees will look at goals scored, penalties awarded, red cards and mistaken identities as part of a semi-live trial.
The referee will not be able to review the footage on a pitchside monitor.
Fifa president Gianni Infantino said in April he hoped the 2018 World Cup in Russia would be the first tournament to use the technology.
Video replays were first used at international level during a friendly between Italy and France in September.
It has been tested in six other countries, including in the third-tier United Soccer League in America and the Dutch Cup, with a final decision on its use to be made by 2018.
"Football will not be changed by this and I hope that football will become more honest," said Marco van Basten, former Netherlands striker and Fifa's chief of technical development.
"I am convinced it will be good. It may take some time. Players, referees will have to adapt a bit but it will be good."
