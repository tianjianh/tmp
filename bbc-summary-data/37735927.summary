The 22-year-old Scot finished four seconds ahead of Polish opponent Justyna Kaczkowska in the final.
She set a personal best in qualifying on the way as she added gold to the silver she won in the elimination race.
Archibald was part of Britain's gold medal-winning team pursuit quartet at the Olympics in Rio.
"I thought I was destined for failure because I'd been working at a lot slower pace in training," she said.
"I guess I must still be benefiting from my Olympic form but I'm also pretty well rested.
"It guarantees me a place at the World Championships as continental champion so that's my ticket booked. I'm really happy."
Elsewhere, Elinor Barker finished fifth in the points race and Mark Stewart sixth in the new-look omnium, which has been reduced to four events from six and contested over one day rather than two, while Rachel James fell in the Keirin final.
