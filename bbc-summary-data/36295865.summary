Speaking on the BBC's Andrew Marr Show, she said she was "rather surprised" by the news, which came on Wednesday.
The increased threat level means an attack in England, Scotland or Wales is "a strong possibility".
The level for Northern Ireland-related terrorism in Northern Ireland remains severe.
Mrs Foster said Stormont would have to "work even harder" to fight the threat of terrorism and work "with our neighbours in the Republic".
She said terrorists "use the cover of republicanism to engage in criminality.
"They seek to move us backwards.
"We need to bring stability to Northern Ireland in a way they really don't want to see happening."
When asked about her own experiences during the Troubles, Mrs Foster said she knew "very well what terrorism was all about."
She told Andrew Marr that republican terrorists had "capabilities". She said: "They've shown that by the murder of Adrian Ismay earlier this year."
