Massaro won 11-4 3-11 12-10 11-7 to become the first British woman to take the title since Lisa Opie in 1991.
The defeat, by the world number two, was seven-time world champion David's first in a major tournament since 2009.
Being the first Briton to win it in a few years makes it even more special
In the men's event, world number one Ramy Ashour, from Egypt, came from a game down to beat France's Gregory Gaultier 7-11 11-4 11-7 11-8.
Gaultier, the fourth seed, had ended defending champion Nick Matthew's involvement at the semi-final stage and took the first game of the final.
But Ashour, 25, hit back to win the first British Open title of his career.
Massaro, who broke down in tears after winning, described her success as "special".
"It was a really close match. From about the eighth point in the last game I was just thinking 'don't mess it up'," the 29-year-old said.
"The British Open is the first tournament I watched growing up and I will always remember my coach, when I first turned full-time, saying 'one day you will be sitting in the final'. I thought 'yeah right'.
"So it is absolutely amazing that it came true. Being the first Briton to win it in a few years makes it even more special."
Malaysian David, 29, said: "She was playing very well. Sometimes things don't go your way, and all these girls are getting stronger.
"I gave her a little window and she took it. But I will be back."
