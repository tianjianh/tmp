Labour aide Fisher warned over conduct as suspension lifted

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A senior aide to Jeremy Corbyn who suggested people should vote for a Class War candidate in May's election has been let off with a warning by Labour's ruling body.

Andrew Fisher was suspended by the party and faced calls for his expulsion over the August 2014 post on Twitter.
The National Executive Committee said his suspension had now been lifted.
Mr Fisher welcomed the decision but two leading MPs said the "slap on the wrist" was inadequate.
Caroline Flint and Siobhain McDonagh said they were disappointed there had not been a full disciplinary inquiry.
The appointment of Mr Fisher, an economist and former trade union official, to Mr Corbyn's inner circle caused concern among some Labour MPs who questioned statements he had made in the past.
The policy adviser wrote a tweet in August 2014 appearing to endorse the Class War candidate in the Croydon South constituency rather than Labour's candidate Emily Benn. He has since apologised, insisting he had been "misinterpreted".
Other tweets posted from his account, which has since been deleted, were critical of Labour frontbenchers while one message appeared to welcome former shadow chancellor Ed Balls losing his seat in May.
A Labour Party spokeswoman said the NEC had completed its probe into Mr Fisher and that he had been "issued with an NEC warning and his suspension has been lifted with immediate effect".
Mr Fisher said he was "very pleased" with the outcome and had accepted the official warning. "I've been a Labour member for 20 years and all I've wanted is for Labour to be strong and effective - whether in government or opposition.
"I will continue to support Jeremy Corbyn... and help Labour build towards 2020."
After he was suspended earlier this month, Mr Corbyn said Mr Fisher continued to work for him and he retained "full confidence" in him.
But Ms Flint and Ms McDonagh said it was "unacceptable for members to support other parties, delight in Labour MPs losing their seats or to engage in cyber-bullying".
"The chair of this investigation has been subjected to huge pressure, and this has compromised the independence and integrity of Labour's disciplinary process," they said.
"Others have been excluded from our party for less than the activities of Mr Fisher. It would appear that there is one rule for members and one rule for those who work for the party leader."
