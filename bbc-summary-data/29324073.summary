This amazing time-lapse video shows him creating sculptures out of hundreds of blocks of Lego.
It's one of 80 going on display in The Art of the Brick show at London's Old Truman Brewery Gallery from Friday.
Speaking to the BBC, Nathan said: "This is what I do for a living, I create art and I decided for my medium I would choose toy bricks."
He said he hoped children who saw his exhibition would be inspired to create more themselves.
