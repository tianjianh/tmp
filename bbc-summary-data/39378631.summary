Premier League Darts: Michael van Gerwen thumps Dave Chisnall in Cardiff

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Michael van Gerwen bounced back from his record-ending loss to Raymond van Barneveld last time out with a convincing win in the Premier League.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The world number one, who lost for the first time in 45 televised matches in Manchester on 23 March, thrashed Dave Chisnall 7-1 to stay top of the table.
Fellow Dutchman Van Barneveld won his fourth straight game, overcoming an unhappy James Wade 7-2 in Cardiff.
There were also wins for Phil Taylor, Gary Anderson and Peter Wright.
Second-placed Wright was awarded a 7-0 victory over Kim Huybrechts after the Belgian withdrew for family reasons.
Huybrechts, 31, already out of the competition, is spending time with his terminally-ill mother.
The 10-man field was cut to eight players after the ninth round of fixtures in the Welsh capital, with eliminated Jelle Klaasen losing to Taylor.
Two-time Premier League champion Anderson was in superb form in his 7-3 victory over Adrian Lewis, landing a 170 finish and averaging 107.
The eight remaining players will carry their points forward and face each other once more, with the top four in the table after 16 games competing in the play-offs at London's O2 Arena on 18 May.
