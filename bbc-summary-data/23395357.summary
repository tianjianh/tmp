The collision happened on Norwich station's platform six at about 00:10 BST.
The Greater Anglia Great Yarmouth to Norwich service and a stationary East Midlands Trains unit were involved in the "low speed" collision.
The ambulance service said all eight people - including four who were stretchered away - had minor injuries.
The two trains remained upright after the crash.
Both the Rail Accident Investigation Branch and British Transport Police are investigating the collision.
Police said the Great Anglia service was travelling at about 10mph when it collided with the second train.
A spokeswoman for East Midlands Trains said its train, which was empty at the time, has been removed from service because of the damage caused.
"Our first thoughts are for the welfare of those who have been injured in the incident," she said.
A spokeswoman for Greater Anglia said: "The train arriving at Norwich was travelling at very slow speed.
"There were 31 passengers on board.
"Our first priority has been and remains the welfare of the passengers and train crew involved."
The injured were taken to the Norfolk and Norwich Hospital and later discharged.
