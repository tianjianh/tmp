EFL fixtures 2017-18: Why are people talking about Boxing Day on Twitter?

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
It is one of the hottest June days on record and the pollen count is soaring, so why has Boxing Day been trending on twitter?

Far from yearning for TV specials, leftover turkey and enormous call out charges for emergency plumbers, football fans have been looking up and discussing who their team is playing over Christmas.
For the hardiest and most dedicated of fans, that means long journeys across the country at the time when they could be putting their feet up and scoffing chocolates with the fire on.
So whose supporters are facing treks of more than 200 miles each way on 26 December and on New Year's Day?
On Boxing Day, Norwich City fans have the furthest to travel in the Championship, with 163 miles to Birmingham City.
Sheffield Wednesday fans, with the shortest distance, have to go 48 miles to Nottingham Forest.
While potentially nursing sore heads from the new year celebrations, Cardiff City fans have to get about 150 miles to west London for the 1 January fixture with Queens Park Rangers.
Sheffield United have 41 miles to go to Derby County.
Plymouth Argyle face a 227-mile journey to MK Dons on Boxing Day, a 454-mile round trip, while Rochdale only have to get 19 miles to Blackburn Rovers.
However, given Plymouth's location relative to the other clubs, that is not really out of the ordinary. Even a trip to Bristol Rovers would take them more than 120 miles each way.
Walsall fans have drawn the longest journey on New Year's Day, with a 206-mile trek the entire length of the M5 motorway and beyond to Plymouth Argyle.
For Gillingham fans, it is just 29 miles and a drive down the A2 to get to Charlton Athletic.
Notts County supporters have 144 miles to go on Boxing Day to get to Morecambe.
Colchester United and Coventry City fans could shave a few miles off their journeys if they use toll roads, but this chart assumes they will save their money and allow extra time.
Carlisle United have a 174-mile journey to Mansfield Town on New Year's Day, while Morecambe fans can have a bit of a lie-in, as their trip to Accrington Stanley is just 36 miles.
