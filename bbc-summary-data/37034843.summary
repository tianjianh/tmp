Wind and rain led to the postponement of Wednesday's scheduled programme which included the double sculls semi-finals.
Chambers and GB team-mate Will Fletcher finished second in their heat on Monday behind fastest qualifiers South Africa.
Irish brothers Gary and Paul O'Donovan have also made the semi-finals.
The Cork pair, the second fastest qualifiers, clocked 6:23.72 to finish ahead of Italy (6:24.10).
Fletcher and Chambers clocked the sixth fastest qualifying time of 6:25.62.
Chambers and his brother Peter were part of Britain's silver medal-winning lightweight fours crew at London 2012.
Peter Chambers' hopes of a second Olympic medal were dashed on Tuesday when the British lightweight fours failed to qualify for the final.
