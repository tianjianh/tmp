Figures from the Labor Department showed companies added 98,000 jobs last month - far fewer than the 180,000 forecast by economists.
However, the unemployment rate fell to a 10-year low of 4.5%, down from 4.7% in February.
The Dow Jones fell about 7 points to 20,655, while the S&P 500 slipped 1.9 points to 2,355.5.
The tech-heavy Nasdaq shed 1.1 points to 5,877.8.
As well as digesting the latest jobs figures, investors were expected to be cautious following news of the US missile attack on a Syrian government airbase.
Worries over disruption to oil supplies in the Middle East sent the price of crude surging initially.
The price of Brent oil rose 2% above $56 a barrel at one point, before gradually losing most of the gains to stand up 0.5% for the day at $55.17 a barrel. US crude was 1% higher at $52.20 a barrel.
