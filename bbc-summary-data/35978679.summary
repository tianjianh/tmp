An NHS trust which faces an £18m shortfall has announced the closure of a care home.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
St Kilda's, in Brixham, has provided respite, residential and day care since the 1970s.
Torbay and South Devon NHS Foundation Trust has decided services will be moved from the 24-bed home to Brixham Hospital and private care homes.
The trust said it would take up to nine months to close the home describing it as being "in a very poor condition".
One woman, whose mother uses the service but wanted to remain anonymous, said "it's all up in the air" and "we do not know where she will be moved".
"I can't stress enough, that the service provided at St Kilda's is essential."
Before the announcement the trust said the building, which employees 41 members of staff, was "no longer fit for purpose", and it would work with residents and families to find alternative accommodation.
It said previous plans for a new purpose-built centre were conceived "before a significant reduction in funding for adult social care."
"The plans did not reflect the trust's current aspirations to deliver more care at home and in local communities rather than in hospital beds," the trust said.
Also at the board meeting at Torbay Hospital, it was announced the trust is facing an £18m shortfall for the 2016/2017 financial year.
