Tadcaster bridge: Objection lodged to widening plan

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A brewery has lodged an objection to plans to widen a Grade II listed bridge which was damaged by winter flooding in North Yorkshire.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The road bridge over the River Wharfe at Tadcaster partially collapsed in December, with a temporary footbridge currently connecting the two sides.
Plans to widen the bridge were agreed at a council meeting, but in a letter the Samuel Smith's Brewery said the proposal contradicted planning policy.
The brewery did not wish to comment.
Repairs to the bridge are set to conclude in December, with paths widened to improve safety for pedestrians.
The seven-page letter said the proposal was "contrary to the provisions of the adopted Development Plan and national planning policy".
It said the move could impact "important nature conservation interests" and did not consider the effect it would have "on the behaviour of flood waters".
Chris Metcalfe, county councillor for Tadcaster at North Yorkshire County Council, said the brewery could apply for a judicial review on the move.
Speaking to BBC Radio York, the Conservative councillor said: "The brewery had every opportunity to lodge any objection within the statutory consultation period.
"It's absolutely mind-blowing to take this view, especially when aware of the public opinion in Tadcaster."
The government pledged £3m for repair work within days of the bridge collapse, and £1.4m was given by the region's Local Enterprise Partnership to widen and strengthen the bridge.
