[SN]TITLE[SN]
Three for trial over bank machine skimming device fraud

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Three Romanian men are to stand trial accused of running a bank card skimming fraud in a Perthshire village.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Florin Neula, Alexandru Uzum and Eduard Zamosteanu are alleged to have installed a "card trapping" device and a camera on a bank machine in Scone.
They are said to have used the device to take cash from former St Johnstone footballer Nathan Lowndes in May 2015.
The three men denied seven charges against them, and the case was continued for trial.
Necula, 30, Uzum, 25, both of Edinburgh, and Zamosteanu, 27, are accused of possessing the card trapping device at various addresses between 20 May and 9 June this year.
Uzum and Zamosteanu are said to have installed the machine on an ATM in Scone on 20 May, and used it to steal the footballer's bank card and pin code.
Zamosteanu is then alleged to have used the details to operate an ATM and steal Â£200, before the pair then used it again to steal Â£10.
Necula and Uzum are accused of installing the device again at the same machine on 28 May in a bid to steal a bank card and pin code.
At Dundee Sheriff Court, Sheriff Alistair Carmichael continued the case to a sheriff and jury trial assize next week.
