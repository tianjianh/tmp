A primary school band will play to a slightly bigger audience than they are used to on Saturday night when they open a show for Robert Plant.

The former Led Zeppelin frontman agreed to let Y Storm perform after hearing of their success at one of Europe's biggest youth festivals, the Urdd Eisteddfod, in May.
The band members are pupils at Ysgol OM Edwards in Llanuwchllyn, Gwynedd.
Plant's band will headline Forest Live in front of 10,000 people.
The father of two of Y Storm's band members is Liam Tyson, guitarist with the The Sensational Space Shifters which tour with Plant.
One of Tyson's sons, Osian, is a guitarist, while the other, Guto, plays the drums.
Tyson said the gig at Cannock Chase Forest, Staffordshire, was a natural progression for Y Storm after all their hard work and Urdd Eisteddfod success.
He said he asked Plant for a "favour" to see if the children could play at one of their gigs and he replied "of course" straight away.
"He knows they've been in a band, he's seen the progression over the years. He knows they've won the eisteddfod, and he champions all things Welsh, so it was the next step to do," Tyson said.
Despite his links with Plant, Tyson said the band had earned the Forest Live gig on merit.
"For their age they'd give anybody a run," he said.
"They're on the gig because they've done well over the years and they've progressed and progressed and they've kept progressing."
Y Storm write their own material and will be performing in English and Welsh at the concert.
