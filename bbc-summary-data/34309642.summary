Nick Clegg to warn EU exit could tear UK apart

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Nick Clegg is due to warn the Lib Dem conference that a vote to leave the EU could tear the United Kingdom apart.

The former deputy prime minister claims an exit vote would trigger a second Scottish independence referendum.
It comes as Mr Clegg's successor as Lib Dem leader, Tim Farron, prepares to launch the party's campaign to stay in the EU in the vote expected next year.
Mr Farron is also set for a showdown with activists at his party's conference over scrapping Trident.
The Lib Dem leader will speak out against a motion calling for the party to back unilateral nuclear disarmament.
He is expected to argue that while a like-for-like replacement for Trident is too expensive, other options should be considered to maintain Britain's deterrent in an uncertain world.
Mr Clegg's return to the Lib Dem conference stage, four months after his party's crushing election defeat and his own emotional exit from frontline politics, is expected to be greeted warmly by activists.
He will say: "The stakes could not be higher: not just one, but two, unions now hang in the balance.
"If we vote to leave the EU, I have no doubt that the SNP will gleefully grab the opportunity to persuade the people of Scotland to leave the UK as well."
That would leave a "once great country now pulled apart", creating a "Little England" left isolated and lacking international influence, according to Mr Clegg.
"I have no doubt that David Cameron's referendum will be contested on the issue of jobs, economic security, the terms of any renegotiation and so on," he will say.
"But there's a big, enduring question which hangs over all of this: what kind of country do we want to be, what is our role in this globalised world of ours? Open or closed?
"Leading in our own European backyard or isolated from our nearest neighbours?
"Because let's be clear: for all the huffing and puffing we're going to hear from those who want to leave the EU, they have no answer to that fundamental strategic question."
He will also urge Labour to wholeheartedly campaign for the UK to remain in the EU after the confusion of Jeremy Corbyn's first few days at Labour's helm.
Mr Farron, who will formally launch his party's referendum campaign later on Monday, said: "It is not the time to turn our backs on Europe, and leave us isolated, sidelined and alone."
He has used his first conference as Lib Dem leader to launch what he called an "unashamed land grab" for Labour voters following Mr Corbyn's victory.
"I am not a home-wrecker for Labour MPs but I am a home-builder," he told activists.
He said they would be welcome to join what he claimed was the only "credible" alternative to Conservative rule.
He also made a "full and open offer" to members of all parties, including the Tories, who shared his values.
"If you are, in your heart, a liberal and a social democrat you have a home in the Liberal Democrats," he said.
The party claims it has attracted record numbers of activists to its annual conference, including many of the 20,000 people who have joined since the election.
