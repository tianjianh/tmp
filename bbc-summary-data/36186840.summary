[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 36-year-old was fatally injured in Smiths Lane, Goudhurst, on Sunday, where a "non-police" firearm was found.
Police confirmed he was on bail in relation to the death of Roy Blackman, who was beaten to death during a burglary at his home last month.
The man has not been named but his family has been informed, police said.
The matter has been referred to the Independent Police Complaints Commission, which confirmed the 36-year-old man had been shot by police during the operation.
It said tests were being carried out on "what appeared to be a non-police firearm" found during the raid, which took place at about 20:30 BST.
Forensic examination of the scene was continuing, it said.
A post-mortem examination following Mr Blackman's death at his home in Headcorn Road, Biddenden, showed he died from multiple blunt-force injuries.
Mark Love, 37, of Frittenden Road, Staplehurst, has been charged with murder and aggravated burglary.
