The 50MW eight-turbine Kincardine Offshore Windfarm will be constructed nine miles (15km) south east of Aberdeen.
Ministers said that once operational, it would have the capacity to power the equivalent of almost 56,000 homes.
About 110 jobs are expected to be supported during assembly, installation and ongoing operations.
Energy Minister Paul Wheelhouse said the technology had huge potential if it could be demonstrated at scale.
He added: "With 25% of Europe's offshore wind potential, and through development with due regard to our natural environment, Scotland is uniquely and strongly positioned to maximise the economic and environmental benefits that the technology can deliver, which will help us progress towards our carbon emission reduction targets."
Lang Banks, director of WWF Scotland, said: "The continued development of floating turbines in Scotland is encouraging as it could enable us and other nations to secure even more clean power from offshore wind."
