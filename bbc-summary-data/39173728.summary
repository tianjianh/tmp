Roger Schmidt: Bayer Leverkusen sack boss after heavy defeat

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Bayer Leverkusen have sacked manager Roger Schmidt following Saturday's 6-2 defeat by Borussia Dortmund.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Four losses in their past six Bundesliga games have taken them down into ninth place.
Schmidt, 49, has been considered one of the Bundesliga's top managers, and is seen as a possible Arsenal boss when Arsene Wenger leaves.
They are still in the Champions League, but trail 4-2 to Atletico Madrid after their last-16 first-leg game.
Sporting director Rudi Voller said: "I believe Roger Schmidt is an absolute top coach. But we have to act now if we are not going to lose touch with our targets."
