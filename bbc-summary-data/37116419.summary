Opening of new £48.5m school campus in Wick delayed

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A new £48.5m school campus in the Highlands is unlikely to open in October as planned, Highland Council has said.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Wick Joint Campus is being constructed to replace Wick High School and Pulteneytown and South primaries.
It will also have community facilities which will be available to the public.
Highland Council said its contractor Hub North Scotland (Wick) Ltd had informed it of delays affecting the completion of the site.
The local authority said: "Regrettably it seems unlikely that the campus will be ready to open in October, as envisaged.
"Highland Council intends the best facilities possible for children and staff, and will not accept these buildings until work is completed.
"The council is working with the contractor to determine what the earliest possible date is for completion of the whole Wick Joint Campus project, and will make further announcements as soon as possible."
