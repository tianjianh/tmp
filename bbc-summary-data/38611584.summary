Comley returned to the R's at the start of January after a four-month loan spell with the Mariners.
The 21-year-old made 22 appearances for Grimsby in all competitions, starting in 19 of those games.
"Athletically, he can get round a pitch really well - on the ball, there is a lot more to come from him," Grimsby manager Marcus Bignot said.
