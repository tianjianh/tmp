[SN]TITLE[SN]
Raith Rovers 0-2 Dunfermline Athletic

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Goals Nicky Clark and Lee Ashcroft gave Dunfermline Athletic victory in the Fife derby away to Raith Rovers and make it seven games unbeaten.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
It means the Pars move out of the bottom two of the Scottish Championship.
Kevin Cuthbert's fine save denied Ashcroft before Clark netted from Dunfermline's third successive corner after only 11 minutes at Stark's Park.
With 12 minutes left, Ashcroft turned home Kallum Higginbotham's cross.
Rovers, who had drawn five of their previous six league matches, had battled hard for an equaliser.
But it was Dunfermline who had looked likely to increase their lead, with Michael Moffat and Clark (twice) having opportunities to increase the visitors' lead.
The Pars jump up to sixth, four points behind the Kirkcaldy side, above Queen of the South, Dumbarton and Ayr United, who now occupy second bottom spot.
