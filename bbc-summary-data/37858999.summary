Chris and Colin Weir donated £1m to the arts company after it appealed for funds to transform a former Glasgow warehouse into a purpose-built HQ.
The contribution from the Ayrshire couple was described by the company as a "major gift".
The pair won a EuroMillions jackpot of £161m in 2011.
NTS thanked the couple and other benefactors as staff moved into the completed Rockvilla complex at Speirs Wharf, on the banks of the Forth and Clyde Canal.
Mr and Mrs Weir said: "It's a great pleasure for us to support this next exciting chapter of the National Theatre of Scotland.
"As well as becoming a beacon that will attract some of the world's finest artists to come and make work here in Scotland, we are excited about the possibilities that Rockvilla will create for our young people and communities to engage in life-changing arts activity and to nurture theatre-making talent for generations to come."
The public campaign was launched in October 2015 and secured further contributions of more than £3m from the Scottish government, Glasgow City Council and the Vacant and Derelict Land Fund against the total £6.5m project costs.
It enabled the NTS to fill the remaining funding gap and reduce the need for borrowing on the new facility. The theatre has currently raised £5.1m towards the project costs.
The building will be officially opened early next year as fundraising continues.
A spokeswoman for the NTS said: "The National Theatre of Scotland is delighted to be part of an emerging cultural hub in this area of Glasgow.
"Other cultural tenants include Scottish Opera, the Royal Conservatoire of Scotland, Glasgow Sculpture Studios, The Glue Factory and the Whisky Bond."
