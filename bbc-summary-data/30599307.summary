Ben Finch, 42, was killed when his BMW M3 caught fire after it hit a tree in Selhurstpark Road, near Goodwood Racecourse on 29 November.
Sussex Police said DNA tests confirmed he was the driver and his family had been informed.
Firefighters tackled the blaze but Mr Finch, who was the only person in the car, died at the scene.
Officers want to speak to the driver of a Land Rover Defender that was at the scene after the crash at about 15:30 GMT on the day of the crash.
