Pilots union Balpa finds 'strong support' for strike

Pilots union Balpa has said its members are willing to take strike action over helicopter firm job losses.

Bristow Helicopters revealed last month it could make 130 of its 1,950 UK staff redundant.
CHC then announced that about 50 jobs were at risk amid "challenging conditions" for the offshore industry.
Balpa said its members had indicated "strong support" for strike action and that a move to a formal strike vote would be considered.
The union said pilots accepted the downturn in the industry meant jobs would go.
However, Balpa said concerns surrounded the way firms were dealing with job losses and the impact on safety.
General secretary Jim McAuslan said:  "We are not being unreasonable. We know the downturn in the North Sea is going to hit jobs, but the way the companies are going about it is causing massive frustration, borne out by the very high turnout and strong 'yes' vote in this ballot conducted over just four days.
"In the event management do not substantially shift their position, Balpa's National Executive Council will be meeting early next month to consider a move to a formal strike vote, something we are still hoping to avoid."
He continued: "Safety must come first.
"We are not saying that helicopter companies are indifferent to these issues, but we would be remiss if we didn't highlight the stress and pressure that pilots are feeling.
"We will be passing these concerns on to the Civil Aviation Authority who regulate aviation in the North Sea."
Deirdre Michie, chief executive of industry body Oil and Gas UK, said: "We urge all stakeholders in this great UK industry - companies, unions and employees alike - to reject conflict and work together to avoid industrial action which would only serve to further undermine the sector's future in terms of jobs, investment, innovation and energy security for the long-term."
