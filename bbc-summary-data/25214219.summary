[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Harbinder Khatkar, from Sinfin, in Derby, was found guilty of a string of attacks in the Pear Tree and Normanton areas of the city between midnight on February 1 and 9:00 the next day.
The 37-year-old was also convicted of the rape of a woman in 2011 for which he had previously been acquitted.
Derbyshire police said they were some of the "worst crimes imaginable".
Khatkar, whose charges included rape, robbery, causing actual bodily harm, assault, sexual assault and trespass with the intent to commit a sexual offence, is expected to be sentenced at Derby Crown Court on Friday.
One victim, who cannot be named for legal reasons, told the hearing her life had been "completely devastated" by what Khatkar had done to her in her own home.
Det Insp Douglas Naden said: "This has been one of the largest and most complex investigations undertaken by my team of detectives - and in terms of serial offending has been one of the worst cases they have ever dealt with.
"The court has heard evidence of some of the worst crimes imaginable which have had a devastating impact on the victims and their families."
Khatkar had previously been acquitted of raping a woman in 2011 but the Crown Prosecution Service successfully overturned the verdict at the Court of Appeal so he could be tried again.
It is the first retrial in Derbyshire under the amended double jeopardy law.
