Limavady farmer fined after friend dies in farmyard accident

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A Limavady farmer, whose employee fell to his death in a farmyard accident in March, has been fined Â£2,500 at Londonderry Crown Court.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
John Mervyn Thompson, 49, from Dowland Road in Limavady, pleaded guilty to failing to ensure a safe system of work for his employee.
Robert Kelly, 56, fell three metres from a ladder on to a concrete floor in a barn on the dairy farm.
Mr Kelly, who was a close friend of the defendant, died from his injuries.
The court was told the two men were working together to repair a storm-damaged roof.
Mr Kelly went inside the barn to gain access to the roof from underneath. However, he looked through a hole in the roof and slipped.
Judge Phillip Babington was told that Thompson had been comforting Mr Kelly's family since the tragic accident and was still a close family friend.
Judge Babington said the fine was not putting a price on Mr Kelly's life but it was "simply to mark the fact that a health and safety law had been broken".
Kevin Campbell, an inspector with the Health and Safety Executive for Northern Ireland (HSENI), said: "This accident was completely preventable.
"This underlines why farmers must not ignore the potential dangers associated with working at heights.
"Farmers must never take shortcuts and should ensure that proper controls, such as scaffolding, should always be in place to prevent workers being injured.
"They should also consider using a professional roofing contractor when required.
"Falls from a height are one of the four main causes of accidents resulting in serious injuries and death on Northern Ireland's farms."
