On eight minutes, McGinn's deflected effort from inside the box cancelled out Harry Panayiotou's first leg goal, and just four minutes later, McGregor headed home Liam Henderson's corner.
Rovers pressed hard after the break but could not find a leveller.
Hibs now host Falkirk on Tuesday night.
The Hibees head coach Alan Stubbs said pre-match he was looking for his players to come flying out of the traps and they duly did so in fantastic style.
Anthony Stokes did well to create space on the left for McGinn, the midfielder took one touch and fired at goal, with the ball taking a huge deflection, finding the net off the underside of the crossbar.
And the Easter Road fans were on their feet again moments later as they took control of the tie.
James Craigan gave away a needless corner that was floated in by Henderson. Defender McGregor soared above everyone to bullet a header into the bottom corner.

The home side were in complete domination and David Gray fired a ball across the six-yard box but there was no Hibs player on hand to knock the ball home.
There was a let-off for the home side when Ryan Hardie then Louis Longridge missed glorious chances after the Hibs defence failed to cope with a looping ball by Craigan.
Raith boss Ray McKinnon introduced both Panayiotou and Mark Stewart in an attempt to change the pattern of play but it was Hibs who continued to dominate.
Henderson came close to extending the home sides lead but was denied by a wonderful save by Kevin Cuthbert.
Raith began to pour more and more men forward and Lewis Toshney headed over as he leapt above the Hibs defence.
Gray was inches away from scoring a third for Hibs but his header came crashing back off the post and was cleared away by the Rovers defence.
Referee John Mckendrick added on four additional minutes that the home side were able to play out with ease to earn them a two legged last four play-off as the battle for a Premiership place continues.
