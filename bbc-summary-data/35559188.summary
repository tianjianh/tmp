The service, announced by Estonian state-owned airline Nordic Aviation, will run three times a week between 28 May and 3 October.
It will be operated in co-operation with Adria Airways.
Edinburgh Airport said the new service, which will use CRJ-900 jets, will be Scotland's only direct flight to Estonia.
The airport's chief executive, Gordon Dewar, said: "This announcement is yet further confirmation of Edinburgh Airport's position as the leader for business and tourism connectivity between Scotland and international destinations."
Nordic Aviation board member Erik Sakkov added: "Edinburgh's rich historical heritage makes it perfect for Estonian holidaymakers who will enjoy a unique combination of ancient Scottish and modern European culture."
