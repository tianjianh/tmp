Lawrence came through the Giants academy and has shown versatility in a number of positions, playing wing and centre as well as loose forward.
The 25-year-old's current deal was due to run out at the end of this season.
"I had no hesitation in staying when the offer came and for some it can be a worrying time if you are out of contract," he told the club website.
"I have always been happy here and like to think I've played my part in pushing us up towards the top end of the competition."
