Lee Hodges: Truro City boss frustrated with inconsistent results

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Truro City boss Lee Hodges has admitted he is "frustrated" with his side's "Jekyll and Hyde" form in National League South.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Truro have lost their past three games, conceding 11 goals and scoring none, and they are 18th in the table.
They have not won in successive games since November, when they won four of their five matches in all competitions.
"I'm very concerned about it, but that's the way the team have been the whole season," Hodges said.
"They've been very Jekyll and Hyde, and the 4-0 [loss at Bath on Saturday] was very harsh on us.
"You've got to take your chances when you get them and at the moment we don't seem to be doing that. That's the disappointing thing."
