[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
German champions Bayern Munich have signed Morocco defender Mehdi Benatia from Roma for an undisclosed fee.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 27-year-old, who helped Roma finish second in Serie A last season, had been linked with a move to Premier League sides Chelsea and Manchester United.
Bayern were looking for a defender after Spain international Javi Martinez was ruled out until the New Year with ruptured cruciate knee ligaments.
Roma have replaced Benatia with Olympiakos defender Kostas Manolas.
