[SN]TITLE[SN]
India French envoy Pascal Mazurier bailed in rape case

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A French diplomat, who has been charged with raping his three-year-old daughter, has been released from an Indian prison on bail.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Pascal Mazurier, who was a consular official in the southern city of Bangalore, was arrested in June after complaints from his Indian wife.
The court has ordered Mr Mazurier to surrender his passport and pay 100,000 rupees ($1,895; Â£1,175) for his bail.
The envoy has made no comment on the charges yet.
Mr Mazurier was held in the crowded Parapanna Agrahara jail, on the outskirts of Bangalore, which houses more than 4,000 convicts and under trials.
His wife Suja Jones Mazurier, who accused him of sexually abusing their daughter, has appealed to the French ambassador in India and the Indian government to not allow her husband to leave the country until all legal proceedings are complete.
She has also asked the French embassy for financial support for herself and her three children, who are French citizens.
