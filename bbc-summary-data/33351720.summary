The blaze began at about 13:40 BST off the B1107 near Kingfisher Lake.
The fire service said nine fire engines and other vehicles had been sent to the scene and a water carrier was on the way.
The Forestry Commission said the hot weather was a "contributing factor" and warned forest users not to start barbecues or discard cigarettes.
