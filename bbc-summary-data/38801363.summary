O'Sullivan, 23, was allowed to leave Rovers after returning from a loan spell at Accrington where he played 25 games, scoring twice.
The Republic of Ireland Under-21 player made six appearances in seven and a half years at Ewood Park.
"He's got good pedigree," assistant boss Lee Dykes said.
"John has had some good loan spells where he's been tested in different ways."
Those loan moves took in stints with Southport, Accrington, Barnsley, Rochdale and Bury.
