Sixteen championship events across 12 Commonwealth Games sports will take place in 2017, including athletics, gymnastics and swimming.
And some events will act as qualifying opportunities for the Gold Coast 2018 Games.
A selection of the Team Scotland events will be live streamed by BBC Scotland later this year.
"Almost every athlete who competes for Team Scotland at the next Commonwealth Games in Gold Coast and onwards to 2022 and beyond, will have competed in their sport's Scottish Championships on their path to international success," said chair of Commonwealth Games Scotland Paul Bush.
"So when we are watching these events we are watching Team Scotland's future stars in action.
"I am particularly delighted that BBC Scotland has recognised the important role that the Team Scotland Series will play in showcasing the best of Scottish sport and the build-up to Gold Coast 2018 and would like to thank them for their support."
Glasgow 2014 gold medallist Kimberley Renicks will be among those competing in Saturday's judo event at Meadowbank Sports Arena.
And retired judoka Euan Burton, who was Scotland's flag bearer at the Glasgow Commonwealth Games, said: "The Scottish Open has always played a part in the development of Scottish judo athletes. All our medallists from Team Scotland in Glasgow 2014 had utilised the event at some stage along their performance pathway.
"In all sports, that goal of competing in the Commonwealth Games is a progressive journey, which includes the key milestone of a Scottish Championships. The Team Scotland Series is a great way to highlight the importance of these events. I'm really proud that judo is the sport to kick it all off on Saturday."
