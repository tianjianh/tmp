[SN]TITLE[SN]
Middlesbrough 1-0 Sheffield United

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Rudy Gestede's first-half header earned Garry Monk's Middlesbrough a home win over Sheffield United and their first points of the Championship season.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Gestede looped the ball over goalkeeper Jamal Blackman after the Blades had failed to clear Patrick Bamford's lofted pass into the penalty area.
The former Aston Villa man hit the post with another header before half-time.
Sheffield United, who won their opening match against Brentford, had a goal disallowed in stoppage time.
Jack O'Connell was adjudged to be offside when Dael Fry nodded a free-kick into his own net and, with that, the League One champions suffered their first defeat since 24 January.
Before the dramatic ending, the Blades' best attempt at goal was Paul Coutts' side-footed effort from 20 yards, which Darren Randolph palmed wide for a corner.
Gestede and Bamford were two of four additions to the Middlesbrough side beaten at Wolves seven days earlier, replacing summer signings Martin Braithwaite and Ashley Fletcher, and the pair repaid their manager's faith by combining for Boro's first league goal of the campaign.
The hosts also gave a debut to midfielder Lewis Baker, who played the final 23 minutes as a substitute after joining the club on loan from Chelsea on Friday.
