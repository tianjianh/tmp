Salford led 8-4 at the break thanks to Greg Johnson's first-half try.
After his first-half score for Cas, Denny Solomona ran in two more after the interval to complete his hat-trick and make the last quarter interesting.
But, for the second time, centre Griffin and Carney scored within five minutes of each other to seal victory.
Carney, who left Cas for Salford on a season-long loan, was in the sin-bin after just five minutes following a set-to.
But the Australian winger kept his cool after returning to the field to help Salford secure their first win at Castleford since 2004.
Gareth O'Brien enjoyed a perfect afternoon with the boot, but there was one setback as the visitors lost stand-off Robert Lui with a knee injury.
Luke Gale was the other Tigers scorer, kicking two of his three conversions.
Castleford head coach Daryl Powell:
"There are too many poor things in our game at the moment.
"There's a lot of injuries in Super League this year and we're getting belted with our fair share.
"We've got a lot of outstanding rugby league players sat on their backsides at the moment.
"Rugby league is a game for tough men and we're going to have to be tough over the coming weeks."
Salford head coach Ian Watson:
"Justin Carney has been great this week. He's a big player for us. I spoke to him all week about him playing here and he was adamant that he wanted to play.
"We spent a lot of time speaking about situations exactly like what happened. It's an experience this game for him. It's probably something he's never faced in his life before.
"To be fair to him, all week he's been really good and said the right things, but the emotion kind of got to him. Jake Webster has slapped him across the face and then he's lashed out again. He made a mistake but he's a genuinely good guy.
"We haven't seen the game out over the last few weeks so it's pleasing to come to Castleford and get such a massive result. They're a good team."
