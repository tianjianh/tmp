The 28-year-old former Middlesbrough and Bournemouth forward had appeared to suggest on social media on 29 May that he was leaving the Robins this summer.
"Been a pleasure to wear the shirt, THANK YOU so much to everyone," Tomlin had posted on Instagram and Twitter.
But Johnson, whose side finished 17th in 2016-17, told BBC Radio Bristol: "He is here. Of course he is in our plans."
The head coach added: "I signed Lee Tomlin because I wanted to build around him and I believed in the talent and the personality.
"There is no doubt he had challenges in his life last year. But we're always here for him. We want to make sure the best Lee Tomlin is out there playing on the pitch.
"He has to make sure he conforms to everything that's part of that Bristol City ethos. If he does, if we can get him right, he's a top player."
Tomlin, who arrived for an undisclosed fee in July 2016, scored six goals in 38 league appearances in his first season with the Ashton Gate club.

Meanwhile, Johnson also confirmed the club are still hoping veteran striker Aaron Wilbraham will sign a new contract.
The 37-year-old, who has scored 30 league goals since arriving in 2014, was offered an extended deal in May, which also included some "additional non-playing responsibilities" for the club captain.
"We've offered Aaron a deal - he hasn't turned it down yet, which is a good sign," Johnson continued.
"I know there are a couple of clubs that want Aaron and I suppose it's a case of just seeing whether we can tweak the deal and get it over the line."
