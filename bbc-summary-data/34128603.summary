[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A major redecoration project to restore the vaulted ceiling at Oxford Town Hall has been completed.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Grade II* listed Victorian main hall, owned by the city council, was repainted at a cost of Â£140,000.
Oxford Town Hall in St Aldate's is used as a venue for wedding receptions and council events.
Speaking at the official reopening ceremony, council Leader Bob Price said the hall is now in "sparkling condition".
A craft team hand-brushed and vacuumed the plasterwork to clean 30 years of accumulated dust and dirt from the ceiling, before applying the paint by hand.
The town hall is one of central Oxford's most recognisable buildings.  Designed by Henry Hare, it was officially opened by the Prince of Wales in 1897.
It generates more than Â£500,000 every year for the council.
During the work, Neale Cole, from contractors Mitie, described it as a "complex job" with paint having to be carefully mixed to match existing colours.
Free standing scaffolding was erected so as not to damage any of the delicate plasterwork on the walls.
The ceiling above the stage and the hall's original Henry Willis organ was painted last.
