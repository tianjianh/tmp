[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A pregnant woman living in Queensland, Australia has tested positive for the Zika virus, say health authorities.

The woman had recently returned from an overseas trip, said Queensland Health, but gave no further details. She was diagnosed on Tuesday.
It is Australia's third case of Zika, following two people in Queensland who also caught it abroad.
Zika has been linked to a condition called microcephaly, in which babies are born with underdeveloped brains.
An international health emergency has been declared by the World Health Organization over the virus, which has spread rapidly in South and Central America, as well as the Caribbean.
Brazil has been particularly badly affected, prompting concern about its hosting of this summer's Olympics.
While the mosquito-borne disease is a concern for women who are, or may become, pregnant, most other sufferers experience only mild symptoms, such as fevers and skin rashes.
