[SN]TITLE[SN]
Braintree Town 1-2 Dover Athletic

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Dover Athletic boosted their hopes of a play-off place with a last-minute winner against Braintree.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Braintree went ahead within eight minutes as Michael Cheek rose highest to meet right-back Sean Clohessy's cross.
Dover's Ricky Miller had a goal ruled out midway through the half as they chased an equaliser, before the home side threatened to double their advantage as Craig Braham-Barrett struck the outside of Mitch Walker's post.
The equaliser came in the 64th minute, when Connor Essam headed in Joe Healy's free-kick, and it got worse for the home side moments later as Braham-Barrett, against his former club, received a straight red for a dangerous challenge on Ricky Modeste.
Reece Hall-Johnson went close to an unlikely Braintree winner but it was Dover who took the spoils as substitute Mitch Pinnock found Miller who converted in the last minute, dropping Braintree into the relegation zone.
