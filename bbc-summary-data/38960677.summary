Ray Roberts, from Margate, Kent, was a passenger in the twin-seat aircraft as part of the celebrations at Biggin Hill Airport.
The airport played a pivotal role in the Battle of Britain when it served as one of the principal fighter bases.
Fellow centenarians Lily Osborne and Trudy Baxter flew behind in a Learjet 75 as part of the celebrations.
Mr Roberts, who was flown by Captain Peter Kynsey, joined the RAF in 1940.
He trained as a pilot before being injured that year when his parachute failed to fully open after he bailed out of a Spitfire.
In 1941 he joined the Air Transport Auxiliary (ATA) and spent the remainder of World War Two delivering aircraft to service units.
Mr Roberts' daughter, Lyndi Roberts, said: "He is just amazed to be given the opportunity."
Biggin Hill served as one of the vital command bases for the Hurricanes and Spitfires of RAF Fighter Command.
In the 1950s it began accepting civil flights alongside its role as a rapid reaction station.
Biggin Hill managing director Will Curtis told guests at the centenary celebrations: "We are aware that Biggin Hill sat at the very tipping point of the Second World War."
