The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) said it was investigating "an international syndicate which is believed to be attempting to corrupt the PSL".
The pair play for Islamabad United who won their opening PSL match against Peshawar Zalmi in Dubai on Thursday.
Both batsmen have now been sent home.
Three more players - fast bowler Mohammad Irfan (Islamabad United), left-arm spinner Zulfiqar Babar (Quetta Gladiators) and opening batsman Shazaib Hassan (Karachi Kings) - were also questioned by the PCB's anti-corruption unit.
PSL chairman Najam Sethi said on Saturday that the trio would continue to play for their respective franchises.
Sharjeel, 27, has played one Test match, 25 one-day internationals and 15 Twenty20 internationals for Pakistan while Latif, 31, has made five ODI and 13 T20 appearances.
The pair put on 107 for Pakistan in their nine-wicket T20 victory over England at Old Trafford in September.
Sharjeel is due to play for Leicestershire in the 2017 T20 Blast but the club have declined to comment.
