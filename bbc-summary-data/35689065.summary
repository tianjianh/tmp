Bird, 29, who took a Test-best haul of 5-59 in Australia's recent win over New Zealand, is available for the opening 10 matches of the County Championship.
Dan Christian, Notts' overseas player for the T20 Blast, is likely to play in the One-Day Cup as cover for Siddle.
"After Peter got injured, Jackson is the man Australia turned to," said director of cricket Mick Newell.
"He's a similar bowler to Peter in many ways and he was the obvious choice for us in the circumstances.
"Jackson is also very suitable for English conditions, particularly the types of pitches we play on at Trent Bridge.
"Pairing him with Stuart Broad early in the season, with real competition for the other two places, is an exciting combination for us."
Pace bowler Bird spent three months with Hampshire at the beginning of the 2015 season, taking 19 County Championship wickets at an average of 39.74.
He also took eight wickets in limited-over formats for the county last year.
