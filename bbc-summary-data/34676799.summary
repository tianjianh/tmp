Mental health equality call gets high profile backing

A campaign calling for an increase in funding for mental health services in England has been launched.

Over200 celebrities have backed the push for mental health to be treated as seriously as other illnesses.
It was launched by former mental health minister Norman Lamb; ex-international development secretary Andrew Mitchell; and Alastair Campbell, previously Tony Blair's communications chief.
The three have all experienced mental health problems in their families.
Mr Lamb's son was diagnosed with obsessive compulsive disorder at the age of 15 and Mr Campbell has spoken about his battle with depression.
The NHS became officially responsible for ensuring that the standard of care for the mentally-ill was equal to that of physically-ill people in 2012.
In the spring, the government pledged an extra Â£1.25bn largely for children's mental health over the next five years.
It also introduced the first waiting time targets in mental health, guaranteeing treatment within 18 weeks.
But the campaign says not enough has been done to address a continuing inequality in care standards and funding.
Mental health problems account for more than 22% of the NHS workload but only 11% of its expenditure.
In July's Budget, George Osborne announced a reduction in Employment and Support Allowance (ESA) for people applying after April 2017. Almost half of claims for ESA are for mental health sufferers, according to the charity, Mind.
The campaign highlights a lack of access to treatment, with three out of four mentally ill children receiving no treatment at all.
There are also concerns that people are moved around too much, including placing children in adult wards.
The life expectancy for people with mental health problems remains 20 years lower than for the general population.
A change of mindset is needed, Mr Lamb insists, "If we talk about it and treat it like any other illness, we can start to break the taboos, break the stigma."
Comedian Frank Skinner, former footballer Ian Wright and presenter Graham Norton are also among the high profile names to back the campaign.
A number of supporters have spoken up about their own experiences with depression, including Ruby Wax and Emma Thompson.
People with mental ill health "don't get the same right to access treatment on a timely basis that everyone else gets," says Norman Lamb. He calls it  a "historic injustice."
While accepting that the NHS is under pressure at the moment, Paul Farmer, Chief Executive of the charity Mind, says: "When people don't get the right help at the right time, the risk is that they become more unwell and need more intensive - and expensive - treatment further down the line."
Failing to treat mental health problem in a timely manner also has an economic impact.
The cost is estimated at billions of pounds a year in "loss of work, in payment of benefits, and the impact on families," Mr Lamb says.
While campaigners acknowledge that progress has been made in this area, the levels of investment are not being matched with that of physical health.
In a statement the Department of Health said: "For the first time in NHS history, we are giving mental and physical health conditions equal priority in law.
"We are helping more people than ever before receive talking therapies - Over 3 million people have entered treatment through the Improving Access for Psychological Therapies (IAPT) programme, with  more than 700,000 reaching recovery."
