Wales wing Alex Cuthbert grabbed the final score while Steve Shingler also crossed in his 22-point haul.
Nick Williams, Blaine Scully, Sion Bennett, Kris Dacey, Willis Halaholo and man-of-the-match Matthew Morgan scored the other home tries.
Meanwhile, Ian McKinley and Angelo Esposito both crossed for Treviso.
It was a much-needed return to form for the Welsh side who had not won in the Pro12 since Boxing Day.
There was little sign of them cutting loose in the first half, however, despite an early 25-metre charge from Williams and a late close-range corner effort from Scully.
McKinley, Treviso's Irish fly-half, danced over for a try while half-back partner and former Osprey Tito Tebaldi added the conversion to his two penalties.
The second half was virtual one-way traffic as the Blues came out firing on all cylinders, running the ball from their own 22.
Shingler, Bennett and Dacey all crossed inside ten minutes, Dacey finishing off after a spectacular solo run from Morgan, and Shingler converted them all to seal the result.
Esposito pulled a try back with Tebaldi converting, but it was only a temporary hold-up to a dominant Cardiff Blues second-half performance.
Cuthbert's blistering break-out from defence put Halaholo over, Morgan strolled over unopposed and Cuthbert got on the scoresheet himself with a 35-metre run in the final move, to rousing applause from the Cardiff faithful.
Man of the match Matthew Morgan told BBC Wales Sport:
"We knew they were going to be tough first half, we had to wear them down and keep hold of the ball second half and it paid off, the rewards came.
"The coaches gave us permission to go out and just play from our own 22 which I wasn't complaining about, it worked and we had a couple of tries from it.
"Great response from Alex Cuthbert (to criticism of his Wales performance), he just kept his mouth shut and got on with it, to prove what a great player he is, I couldn't be more chuffed for him.
"We just have to keep chipping away (in mid-table), a big game up in Edinburgh next week, another tricky side and they're not going to go away for the full 80 minutes."
