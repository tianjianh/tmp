Barbiturates and opiates were taken from GP Vets in Worting Road, Basingstoke, overnight on Friday.
Items stolen included a substance used to euthanise animals. A small amount could prove fatal if consumed by a human, Hampshire Police said.
The force warned people who may come across the drugs "not to ingest them under any circumstances".
