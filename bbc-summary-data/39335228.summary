Webb, 28, along with Wales team-mate Ken Owens, is on the shortlist for the 2017 Six Nations player of the championship award.
Ex-Wales captain Williams would pick Ireland's Conor Murray and says Webb would make more impact off the bench.
"I think Rhys Webb would be a better bench player," Williams said.

"He would be a better impact player than what Conor Murray would be.
"We're blessed with scrum-halves and whoever you pick there you can make an argument for.
"But I've gone for the Irish combination of Murray and [fly-half Jonathan] Sexton."
British and Irish Lions head coach Warren Gatland will name the squad to tour New Zealand, which includes three Test matches against the All Blacks, on 19 April.
Williams, who was part of three Lions tours, says Webb's Wales and Ospreys half-back partner Dan Biggar could miss out on Lions selection.
With Williams expecting Sexton to be selected, Biggar could miss out to England number 10 George Ford.
"It's between Dan Biggar, George Ford or Finn Russell," Williams told BBC Radio Wales Sport.
"If you're George Ford and you've been the pivot of a team that's won 18 in a row he'd be pretty disappointed if he didn't get picked.
"Dan's a superb player and I'm a massive fan of his but I just think he might miss out to George Ford on this one."
