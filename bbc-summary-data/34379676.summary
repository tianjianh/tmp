Gareth Bale's return to training is a timely boost for Wales ahead of October's Euro 2016 qualifiers says team-mate Neil Taylor.

Bale, 26, has missed Real Madrid's last three games with a calf injury but is set to return for the Madrid derby against Atletico on Sunday, 4 October.
Wales face Bosnia-Herzegovina in Zenica on Saturday, 10 October and host Andorra on the following Tuesday.
"That's a massive boost for us," Swansea defender Taylor said.
"He's a big part of what we do and we know we're capable of going to Bosnia and getting a result, and then there's the Andorra game at home.
"They're going to be the defining two games and we're looking forward to them, and to have Gareth there is a massive boost."
Bale has posted a video on social media of himself training and tweeted: "Stepping up the recovery now."
The former Tottenham player limped out of Real's 4-0 Champions League win over Shakhtar Donetsk on 16 September and a scan later confirmed the injury.
He has scored six of Wales' nine goals in this qualifying campaign to spearhead their bid to reach the finals of a major tournament for the first time since the 1958 World Cup.
Chris Coleman's side are top of Group B and need a point to qualify for next year's European Championship finals in France.
