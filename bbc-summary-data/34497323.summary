Rugby World Cup 2015: No regrets over try bid - Warburton

Wales captain Sam Warburton said he had no regrets about turning down penalty kicks at goal in Wales' 15-6 defeat by Australia in Pool A of the World Cup.

Australia survived seven minutes with 13 players without conceding a point.
The result means the Wallabies advance to face Scotland in the quarter-finals and Wales take on South Africa.
"I felt we needed a try. We were six points behind so it would have needed two penalties to get us level and they were two players down," said Warburton.
"I think any country would have backed themselves to get over. But Australia's defence was fantastic and sometimes you just have to put your hand up and say 'well done'.
"We threw everything at them and I can sit here and say I don't have any regrets."
Warburton also praised the defence of Stephen Moore's team as Wales suffered an 11th consecutive defeat by the Wallabies.
Warren Gatland's team won 12-6 the last time they played the Springboks and were beaten by a last-minute penalty try in Nelspruit in the summer of 2014.
Warburton thinks Wales can overcome the South Africans and reach a second consecutive World Cup semi-final.
"We are already looking forward to that quarter-final - it's against a team we've beaten in the last 12 months," he said.
"And there's one thing our players don't mind it's a challenge and we've proved we can do it in the past.
"I'm disappointed we lost today, but I'll definitely back ourselves next week."
Many doubted Wales would advance from the toughest of all the tournament's pools, which included four teams ranked in the world's top 10.
But victory over England in the second game proved decisive and Warburton feels the win in Twickenham proves they have the players for the big occasion.
"We've had three huge games and I think the players we've got a lot of guys with a lot of caps who are used to dealing with big games," added Warburton.
"Playing these big games in these big stadiums is an absolute privilege. It doesn't faze us, we embrace it."
Wales coach Gatland also highlighted the Wallabies' "courageous" defence as a decisive factor.
"They were throwing their bodies on the line," said Gatland. "We got over the line three times and been held up.
"To me it was just really fine margins. If Dan Biggar kicks that penalty on half-time you're 12-9 down rather than 12-6 down - your mindset changes and you take the three points.
"We did a great job defensively. They didn't really put us under a huge amount of pressure from attack.
"I thought there were times when we played some pretty good rugby as well."
