Cian Healy: Leinster prop handed two-week suspension

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Leinster prop Cian Healy has been banned for two weeks for dangerous play during last weekend's European Champions Cup game against Toulon.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 28-year-old Ireland international was charged with striking Toulon hooker Guilhem Guirado with his knee during the 24-9 defeat in France.
The striking charge was found to be not proven but the incident was deemed to be foul play.
Healy misses the return fixture against Toulon and a Pro12 match with Munster.
Although there were no aggravating factors, judicial officer Roger Morris said the ban could not be reduced because Healy does not have a clean disciplinary record.
The Ireland forward could have received a minimum three-week ban had be been found guilty of deliberately striking Guirado.
The match citing commissioner, John Byett, made a complaint to European Professional Club Rugby following the incident, for which Healy was sin-binned.
Leinster, who have lost all three of their Pool Five matches so far, host holders Toulon at the Aviva Stadium on Saturday.
They then face Munster in a Pro12 derby on 27 December.
