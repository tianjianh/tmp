[SN]TITLE[SN]
Neil Kinnock in Norwich gives as good as he gets

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
For just a moment or two it looked as if things might turn nasty: "He's not inclined to vote?" asked the former Labour leader with incredulity.

He then turned back towards the door which had just been slammed in his face and shouted: "People died to give you the  vote mate," before  storming off.
The home owner, who had just had his afternoon disturbed,  was having none of it: "Oi! Don't come round to my house and start shouting at me like that," he called from the now re-opened door.
Undeterred, Lord Kinnock turned and ran back towards him pursued by camera crews - the man quickly shut his door.
The former Labour leader shouted back at the door and with another flourish he turned and marched off declaring: "You can tell we're not in Egypt." All in a day's work for the veteran campaigner.
Lord Kinnock was doing a spot of door knocking in central Norwich.
As is often the case, it was quite a frustrating business with many people not in. Those who were, were treated to the soft but passionate Welsh tones of a man who once played a key role in British politics.
His sense of humour also appeared to be intact.
"Someone said to me last week 'you used to be Neil Kinnock' which makes me wonder who I am now," he said roaring with laughter.
Labour is not awash with household names these days which is why it was quite a coup for the Norwich Labour party to persuade Lord Kinnock to come and join them.
The fact the candidate for Norwich North, Jess Asato, was once his local councillor in London may have had something to do with it.
"I came because Norwich is absolutely crucial for us and we are in with a good chance of winning two seats here," he told us.
He is, of course, famous for being Britain's longest serving opposition leader.
The man who everyone (including himself) expected to win the 1992 election, only to lose it as the Tory vote strengthened in the last few days of the campaign.
Some commentators have wondered if history may be about to repeat itself, but Lord Kinnock insists that 2015 is very different to 1992.
"We weren't fighting then in the way that we have to fight now and the conditions are different," he said.
"The Tories haven't got a majority this time and they haven't got a leader who had the broad appeal of the almost classless John Major - so consequently we're in a different scrap altogether.
"The substance of policy will make a terrific difference and work in Labour's favour. The message is very high quality, it resonates very strongly with people and we've got nine weeks to make sure it reaches every home in the country."
But as in 1992, when many people questioned  the suitability of Neil Kinnock to become Prime Minister, there is a question mark over whether Ed Miliband is the right leader now.
Lord Kinnock disagrees: "From day one the very partisan press that we have in this country has been hammering him. All that nonsense about him being Red Ed which he isn't, all that stuff about him being a geek which he most certainly isn't.
"What I hope people will focus on is the evidence. His brains which are not in doubt, his standing up to people like the press and the electricity companies and his ability to remain calm when under pressure."
Lord Kinnock has been out of frontline politics for more than 20 years - but the passion's still there.
