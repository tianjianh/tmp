Vikki Preston and Rhona Schofield were at a house on King Street, Higher Broughton, on 9 May 2005 when arguments broke out in a group, police said.
The two were then left alone in the property, described by officers as insecure and in "relative disrepair".
In the early hours of the next morning, fires were started on the ground floor.
Police said the two friends, who were asleep upstairs, were trapped and died from smoke inhalation. No-one has ever been charged.
Martin Bottomley, from Greater Manchester Police, said: "Almost certainly someone living in this community knows what happened and why that house was targeted.
"Ten years is a long time to carry the burden of that knowledge, so please, if you do know something, now is the time to give the family the answers they so desperately seek and come forward."
