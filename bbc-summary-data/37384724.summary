Two of the incidents occurred near the flashpoint West Bank city of Hebron, while the third happened outside a gate to Jerusalem's Old City.
It is the first such spate of attacks after months of near-daily stabbings and car-rammings recently subsided.
A Palestinian was also shot dead when Israeli troops raided his home.
Mohammed Saraheen, 30, was killed while trying to evade arrest during the operation in the West Bank village of Beit Ula on Friday morning, the Israeli military said.
Two of the later attacks on Israelis happened nearby.
In one, a Palestinian was shot dead after ramming his vehicle into civilians at a bus stop near the Israeli settlement of Kiryat Arba, the military said. Three people were wounded.
Another Palestinian who was involved in the attack was shot and wounded, officials said.
Hours later, a Palestinian who stabbed and wounded a soldier at a junction near Hebron was shot dead, officials said.
In East Jerusalem, a Jordanian man was killed by security forces after trying to stab police outside Damascus Gate, according to Israeli authorities.
The site has been the scene of multiple attacks on Israelis, and killings of assailants, in previous months.
Thirty-five Israelis been killed in a wave of knife, gun and car-ramming attacks by Palestinians or Israeli Arabs since last October.
More than 200 Palestinians - mostly attackers, Israel says - have also been killed in that period.
Israel says Palestinian incitement has fuelled the attacks. The Palestinian leadership has blamed frustration rooted in decades of Israeli occupation.
