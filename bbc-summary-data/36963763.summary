Vector Aerospace, which runs the Fleetlands site in Gosport, Hampshire, blamed a drop in workload for its decision to suspend the 2017 intake.
It comes after the firm recently lost out on a contract to upgrade some of the Chinooks, putting 60 jobs at risk.
The site was sold by the MoD to Vector in 2008.
It has offered apprenticeships at its training facility for the past 75 years, taking about eight apprentices each year in Gosport in recent times.
The three-year programme offers successful applicants the chance to get hands-on experience on the maintenance, repair and overhaul of rotary wing aircraft.
Gosport MP Caroline Dinenage, who has been in talks with Vector and union representatives at Fleetlands, said it was "extremely disappointing" to see the scheme suspended.
She added: "The company provides an excellent pipeline for young people from our area to gain technical skills for a rewarding career. I understand this decision will be reviewed over the coming year and I will be urging them to reconsider."
A Vector spokesman said it was disappointed to suspend the scheme but was "fully committed to our current apprentices" and would review the programme in the coming year.
The private firm works closely with Boeing, which builds military craft for the Ministry of Defence, and had been expecting to secure a contract to upgrade the fleet with a Digital Automatic Flight Control System (DAFCS).
But Boeing decided to take the work in-house, despite Vector previously completing another Chinook upgrade package for the manufacturer.
Vector is talking with union officials to try and transfer some staff to Boeing but no guarantees have been given.
The company's long-term deal with Boeing to provide maintenance of the Chinook fleet has not been affected.
Steve Burnell, managing director of Aircraft Support Boeing, said the decision not to award Vector the contract came after a "long and detailed study on the grounds of cost".
A Unite spokesperson said it was "engaged in constructive negotiations with the Vector management" but declined to comment further.
The Fleetlands site, which has historically supported the MoD's helicopter fleet, has seen its workload shrink in recent years after the Sea King and Lynx helicopters went out of service.
Vector, which employs 800 people in Gosport, moved into the civil aviation market to boost its workload.
