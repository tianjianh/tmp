It has reported that the haul included AK47 assault rifles, mortars, explosive material, detonators, other bomb components and at least one revolver.
It follows police searches at a home and lands in Jenkinstown, close to the border with Northern Ireland.
On Monday, police said they had found ammunition and suspected bomb parts.
The Irish Army's bomb disposal team were called to the scene on Monday evening to examine the suspected bomb-making materials.
Irish police (An Garda Síochána) have had success in uncovering alleged dissident republican paramilitary weapons in border areas in recent months.
Last month, they found a similar cache of weapons in County Monaghan.
