Swansea station: No trains due to improvement work

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Railway passengers have been warned they will not be able to catch trains to or from Swansea's station this weekend.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Arriva Trains Wales said it was due to "essential line improvement works" at the station.
The work by Network Rail will only affect customers who want to travel to and from Swansea station itself.
All services between west Wales and Cardiff will be diverted around the station and will "run as usual".
Replacement buses will run between both Port Talbot and Llanelli to the city, Arriva Trains Wales added.
