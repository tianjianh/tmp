Louis Nethercott, 27, from Wiltshire, was medically discharged from 42 Commando in Bickleigh, Devon, last year after struggling to cope with seeing his colleagues killed in Afghanistan.
Alongside another former Marine, Anthony Lambert, the pair are back in the UK after completing a gruelling trek across Borneo.
Louis, who grew up in Bristol, has four more islands to go - Papua New Guinea, Madagascar, Greenland and Baffin.
