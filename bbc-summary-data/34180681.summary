England v Australia: Kevin Pietersen omission helps - Strauss

England are benefiting from the decision to exclude former batsman Kevin Pietersen from selection, says English cricket chief Andrew Strauss.

Strauss, the England and Wales Cricket Board's director of cricket, told Pietersen in May that he would not be considered for an international recall.
"I think that clarity has helped," Strauss said.
England won the Ashes 3-2 but trail 2-0 in the one-day series before Tuesday's third ODI at Old Trafford (14:00 BST).
Pietersen, 35, who was initially sacked after the 5-0 whitewash in the 2013-14 Ashes series, remains England's record run-scorer in all formats.
But Strauss believes the team has "moved on".
He added: "The danger at that time was that particular issue would overshadow everything that happened on the pitch over the course of the summer.
"What I was trying to do was provide clarity going forward so everyone knew where they stood.
"I think the team has moved on and the team is in a pretty good place. Some of those young guys have established themselves and that's what we will be focusing on taking England forward."
England have called up wicketkeeper Jonny Bairstow after deciding to rest Jos Buttler for the remaining three games of the ODI series.
Meanwhile, Australia could be forced into three changes after all-rounder Shane Watson, batsman David Warner and bowler Nathan Coulter-Nile were all ruled out of the rest of the series through injury.
County cricket trio John Hastings of Durham, Yorkshire's Aaron Finch and Gloucestershire's Peter Handscomb have replaced them.
