The visitors looked in trouble when Rikki Clarke (3-63) dismissed Liam Dawson and James Vince in successive deliveries to leave the score at 58-3.
However, Michael Carberry (81) and Ervine (102) batted superbly to ensure the away side reached 339 all out.
Warwickshire finished the day strongly to reach 47-0 and leave an intriguing final day in prospect at Edgbaston.
Hampshire began the day on 38-1 and saw off the opening bowlers before Clarke struck twice in two deliveries.
First Dawson cut the ball straight to Sam Hain at point before Vince was trapped lbw for a golden duck.
With wickets falling around him, Carberry continued his excellent form against Warwickshire, hitting 10 fours and a six before playing onto his stumps to become Clarke's third victim.
Ervine was then well supported on the way to his 17th first-class century by Gareth Berg (36) and Danny Briggs (33), as Hampshire frustrated the hosts and stretched their lead beyond 300.
Warwickshire openers Varun Chopra and Ian Westwood (37) made a positive start to the run chase to leave them 332 runs from victory.
Warwickshire all-rounder Rikki Clarke:
"It's evenly poised. We will have to bat well. It will be a tough chase, but Division One cricket is tough.
"It is good that we came through unscathed tonight and now we have just got to bat well tomorrow and get the job done.
"Batting has been tricky at times but less so at others on a slowish pitch. The new ball has a bit of carry but after about 25 overs it becomes quite a difficult wicket to get people out on."
Hampshire centurion Sean Ervine:
"Most of the time I just try to play positively and it worked well for me today. It was a good day for us.
"We had a tough morning but then recovered well. We have put ourselves in a position where we could win the game or get a good draw.
"It is going to be a good contest. The wicket is still playing reasonably well but there is a bit of variable bounce there.
"Also we have got a lot of swing-bowlers in the team and I believe the weather forecast is for overcast tomorrow so we could get some help there."
