[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Andrew Marcus Burke, 36, of HMP Manchester, was convicted of two counts of assault following a trial at Manchester Crown Court.
He shot a 19-year-old in the abdomen and a 20-year-old in the buttocks while they were in a car on Radcliffe Road, Oldham on 29 June.
Both men were taken to hospital and have made a full recovery.
Det Ch Insp Ian Crewe said: "The judge described Burke as an extremely dangerous man and I can only echo that sentiment.
"We believe his attack was based on a previous dispute and the streets are certainly a lot safer now that he is starting day one of a 20-year jail sentence."
