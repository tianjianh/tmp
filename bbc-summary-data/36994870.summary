[SN]TITLE[SN]
AFC Wimbledon 1-2 Bolton Wanderers

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Liam Trotter's 70th-minute winner put an end to Bolton's remarkable 495-day wait for an away victory as they hit back for a 2-1 victory at AFC Wimbledon.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Phil Parkinson's side fell behind after 16 minutes when Andy Barcham fired the Dons ahead, but Bolton grew in stature after Gary Madine levelled 11 minutes before the interval and deserved their victory.
AFC Wimbledon, playing their first home match at this level, began full of purpose.
Barcham strode onto Dean Parrett's clever knock-down but could only fire wastefully over, though the hosts would soon have their breakthrough.
Jake Reeves slipped a slide-rule pass through for an offside-looking Barcham. The forward did not hesitate, though, curling a fine finish inside Mark Howard's left-hand post.
There had been little to suggest Bolton would find a way back into the contest until a Ryan Clarke howler afforded the visitors a priceless breakthrough.
Mark Davies swooped on a clearance to feed Madine, whose low left-footed shot inexplicably wrong-footed the goalkeeper and dribbled into the back of the net.
And Wanderers completed the turnaround when Trotter arrived at the back post to turn home Madine's wonderful delivery from the right.
