Darling: 'No indyref2 any time soon'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Nicola Sturgeon will not call another independence referendum any time soon because she fears defeat, the man who led the pro-UK campaign ahead of the last vote has predicted.

Alistair Darling said Ms Sturgeon had to regularly "throw red meat" to her supporters by hinting at a second vote.
But he said she "knows she will be finished" if she loses again.
Ms Sturgeon's predecessor as first minister, Alex Salmond, believes there will be a referendum in 2018.
Lord Darling led the Better Together campaign ahead of the 2014 referendum, which saw the No side win by 55%-45%, while Mr Salmond was the figurehead for the pro-independence Yes campaign.
The two politicians were speaking to the BBC's Good Morning Scotland programme on the second anniversary of the 2014 referendum result being announced.
Lord Darling, the former UK Chancellor, said opinion polls had suggested very little has changed in terms of support for independence over the past two years, with most recent polls showing a narrow majority in favour of remaining in the UK.
This is despite the UK as a whole voting to leave the EU while Scotland voted to Remain - a situation Ms Sturgeon has said makes another independence referendum "highly likely".
Lord Darling said Ms Sturgeon would not risk everything, including her reputation, on another referendum which she currently appears far from certain to win.
He added: "If she loses, she knows she will be finished. That is why she has no hurry to rush into it. What she has got to do of course is to continually throw red meat to her supporters.
"In many ways, calling for independence is a diversion because people aren't discussing how is it that people from disadvantaged backgrounds are not getting the same opportunities they are, say, in London?
"Why is it that we have got a shortage of GPs in Scotland when all of these things are controlled by the Scottish government?"
He said most people in Scotland do not want another referendum, and instead wanted governments in both Edinburgh and London to get on with the job of governing.
Lord Darling added: "Brexit has changed a lot for Scotland, for the whole of the UK. To break ourselves away from the European market is very bad in my view and will cause disruption.
"But to then go and break yourself away from what is undoubtedly your biggest single market - which is basically England - would make the situation ten times worse.
"I don't think it will happen any time soon at all. And if you are looking to get into Europe, the deficit that is allowable is about 3%. Ours is about 10%, which would make austerity look like a Sunday afternoon picnic."
Lord Darling's comments were made amid reports in the Herald newspaper that senior SNP figures want their party leader to wait until a potential Tory victory at the 2020 general election before pressing ahead with a second vote.
But Mr Salmond later told Good Morning Scotland that Ms Sturgeon's mandate for a second referendum was "unimpeachable" given that Scotland was being "dragged out of the EU".
He added: "The way that Westminster can stop a referendum of course is by allowing Nicola Sturgeon to secure Scotland's place within the European single market without having an independence referendum.
"Now my judgement is they don't have the flexibility, the sensitivity, the democratic acknowledgement of Scotland's right to do that.
"Which is why my guess is that we are likely to have another independence referendum in two years' time."
Mr Salmond also said the Scottish government's recent Gers figures - which showed the country has a 9.5% public spending deficit - "do not tell you about the finances of an independent Scotland" but instead "show the finances of Scotland within the United Kingdom".
He added: "I don't think any serious economic commentator would question the fact that Scotland has the ability to become a prosperous independent nation, and nobody would seriously doubt Scotland's viability."
Gers was described as the "authoritative publication on Scotland's public finances" in the Scottish government's White Paper on independence ahead of the 2014 referendum, when the figures were more positive than they are now and formed the basis of much of the Yes campaign's economic argument.
Writing in the Sunday Herald newspaper over the weekend, Ms Sturgeon said that "the case for full self-government ultimately transcends the issues of Brexit, of oil, of national wealth and balance sheets and of passing political fads and trends".
Opposition parties said her comments suggested the first minister was now pursuing "independence at any cost".
Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson said: "Instead of trying to explain what would happen to our economy and how we fund our public services under independence, the new mantra is that none of these things matter anymore and people should just shut up about them and wrap themselves in a flag instead."
