Farm workers in Wales promised 6% pay rise

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Around 13,000 farm workers in Wales are set to get a 6% pay rise after no increase for the last three years.

The Welsh government won a Supreme Court battle for the right to set minimum rates, after the UK government scrapped the Agricultural Wages Board.
Deputy Farming Minister Rebecca Evans said it would ensure fair wages, and combat a skills and labour shortage.
But the Farmers' Union of Wales warned that affordability was an issue for many farmers as their own incomes fell.
The one-off pay rise has been promised as an interim measure, before a new advisory panel is set up to decide minimum rates in the future.
Grade 1 pay - the lowest rate - will be set at 2p above the current national minimum wage of Â£6.70 an hour and will apply to all workers over the age of 16.
Ms Evans said the law also gave Grade 1 workers the right to expect training to move up to Grade 2, the rate at which most farm workers are employed.
She added that setting of minimum farm wages was part of a wider drive to ensure the long-term viability of agriculture and tackle rural poverty.
The Farmers' Union of Wales said there had been mixed views among its branches about an increase in minimum wage rates.
It said affordability was an issue for many farmers, given the "dramatic fall" in farm incomes and profitability since the last wage bands were set in 2012, and further anticipated falls in 2015-16.
NFU Cymru president Stephen James called on the Welsh government to publicise the changes, so farmers employing staff in agriculture did not "inadvertently fall foul of the law".
