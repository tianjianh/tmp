The original 20,000 free tickets were snapped up by fans in just 90 minutes.
Organisers said they have been working round the clock to give as many fans the opportunity to see the biggest match in the history of Welsh football.
Wales take on Portugal in Lyon on Wednesday at 20:00 BST.
A 100ft (30m) screen is being installed alongside the Principality Stadium's existing two big screens.
The additional tickets will be available from 10am on Wednesday on the Principality Stadium e-ticketing website.
They will be available on a first-come-first-served basis and people who already have tickets should not apply for more.
The increased capacity is the maximum the stadium can host with the Speedway track in place.
Principality Stadium Manager Mark Williams said: "The buzz around tomorrow's big game is huge and we've seen unprecedented demand across our ticketing platforms since the event was announced just yesterday afternoon.
Gates open at 18.30.
