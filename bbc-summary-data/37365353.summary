Despite already being unable to qualify, Wales started strongly with chances for Jess Fishlock and Natasha Harding in the first half.
The visitors improved after the interval but Wales' well-earned point sees them finish third in Group 8.
Austria's second-placed finish secures their place for next summer's tournament in the Netherlands.
Wales will now turn their attention to the 2019 World Cup qualifying campaign, and manager Jayne Ludlow will have been encouraged by large parts of her side's performance against Austria.
Fishlock had a free-kick saved by Manuela Zinsberger midway through the first half, while Natasha Harding's first-time effort fizzed wide.
Seattle Reign midfielder Fishlock threatened again after the interval with a powerful long-range shot, but both teams struggled to create genuine scoring opportunities as the match wore on.
