Jester the cat was found in Flint, Flintshire with his back legs collapsed and when examined, it was discovered they had become paralysed.
He has a pellet near his spine and has been referred for specialist treatment.
RSPCA inspector Kia Thomas said: "It is unthinkable why somebody would look to shoot a cat in this way."
The attack came after reports of another suspected shooting in the Min Awel area of the town in December.
Mr Thomas added: "Poor Jester has suffered a truly terrible ordeal. We just hope his condition improves.
"This sorry incident is another timely reminder as to the shocking damage a pellet gun can do."
Jester's owner, Tina Lane, said: "We are so saddened by this incident, and the damage that has been caused to Jester.
"The local community have been hugely supportive to us and we hope information will come to light to help find out what has happened."
Anyone with information about the attack on Jester or the suspected earlier shooting is asked to contact the RSPCA on 0300 123 8018.
