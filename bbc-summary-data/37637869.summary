A tour operator has offered a full refund to a couple who complained about a "disaster" coach holiday in the Highlands.

Derek and Julia Limbert hoped to visit Iona, but missed their only chance to visit the Isle after a driver gave them wrong information about ferry sailings.
Other visits on the five-day trip were either cancelled or cut short.
After BBC Scotland contacted the company, it offered the couple a full refund, which they accepted.
They plan to visit Scotland again, with another tour operator.
Mr Limbert described the five-day tour of Oban, Mull, Iona and Skye with Diamond Holidays as a "disaster from start to finish."
The coach collected the couple from their home in Sutton Coldfield, West Midlands on 15 July at 06:20 but took nearly 15 hours to arrive in Stirling at 21:00, because passengers were picked up in other parts of England.
"We had to visit Lichfield, Burton-upon-Trent, Doncaster, Huddersfield, Durham and Newcastle, picking up other passengers en route to our overnight stop," said Mr Limbert.
The couple had booked the trip because they wanted to see Iona, and had hoped to join the local community there in a church service in the abbey.
However, Mr Limbert said the couple missed the trip on 17 July after the driver gave them inaccurate information about ferry times.
Mr Limbert said: "We were told by our driver that the ferry to Iona was every ten minutes.
"We nipped to the toilet but when we got back on the coach we missed it and were then told the ferries were in fact every hour, which meant it was too late for us to visit."
Mr Limbert said a trip to Tobermory advertised in the itinerary was cancelled during the holiday.
The couple said that despite the itinerary suggesting they would spend a "full day" on the Isle of Skye, a 10-hour coach journey meant it was only possible to spend one hour there.
Following a complaint made by the couple to Diamond Holidays about these issues, the travel company initially offered them two Â£20 vouchers as compensation, which they did not accept.
Diamond Holidays then offered a full refund, which the couple have accepted.
Mr and Mrs Limbert have planned another trip to Scotland next month, using a different tour operator.
Mr Limbert said he and his wife love visiting Scotland because it is a "friendly country with beautiful countryside and nice food".
Diamond Holidays managing director Kevin Riley said the company took customer complaints "very seriously".
