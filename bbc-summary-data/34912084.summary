Dundee have confirmed they are in discussions with Celtic about the possibility of playing a Scottish Premiership fixture in North America.
"It's a good opportunity to expand the game and broadcast Scottish football on a world stage," said Australian Rogic.
"Celtic has a massive fan base and it would be fantastic to give some fans over there the chance to see us play."
"There would be a bit of travel involved but we have a few international boys that are used to that.
"You don't think too much about that, though. The first thought is that it would be a positive idea.
"Growing up in Australia, I knew about the Old Firm and definitely knew about the size of this club, but I guess you could call these plans an innovative way to promote the game a little bit more on the world stage."
A formal proposal is expected to be put before the Scottish Professional Football League in the next few weeks, with Boston and Philadelphia possible host cities.
The SPFL board says it would have to "sanction any move for a league game to be played overseas".
Talks between Dundee and Celtic and representatives in the United States have been going on for some time.
Texas-based chairman Tim Keyes and managing director John Nelms took over ownership of Dundee in 2013.
Celtic, who have frequently played friendlies in the USA, revealed in October they were considering starting a franchise in the country.
Dundee, who lost 6-0 at Celtic Park in September, host Celtic at Dens Park on 30 December, their only scheduled home game against them this season.
"We look forward to hearing more details on what certainly sounds to be a forward thinking and incredible opportunity for both clubs," said Alan McEwan, director of Dundee FC Supporters Society.
Uefa and Fifa have also released statements.
"First and foremost this is a matter for the national associations concerned and for Fifa," said a Uefa spokesman.
"But it must be remembered that the framework of the game worldwide is based on association football and the rules and boundaries which apply.
"As a result, clubs cannot simply choose which country they want to play in. There are rules in place and procedures which need to be respected."
And a Fifa counterpart added: "In accordance with the Fifa Regulations Governing International Matches, any such match could only be played if approved by the member associations and confederations concerned.
"Further, according to art. 82.4 of the Fifa Statutes, Fifa may take in any case a final decision.
"For the time being we have not been contacted with regard to the specific proposal you refer to and therefore we are not in a position to comment further."
