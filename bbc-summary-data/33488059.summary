The Potters are also confident of signing former Liverpool and England right-back Glen Johnson before the weekend.
Stoke had agreed a club record fee of Â£12m for Swiss winger Shaqiri.
But they withdrew the offer after he failed to respond to their deadline.
It is understood Stoke, who had given Shaqiri until Thursday lunchtime to commit, will continue looking for a major signing for the wing position.
Johnson, 30, a free agent, could still have a medical on Friday and join the side on their pre-season tour of Singapore.
Van Ginkel, 22, moves on a season-long loan deal after making just four appearances for Chelsea since joining them from Vitesse Arnhem in 2013.
"Marco will bring great energy to the side," said Stoke boss Mark Hughes.
Given, 39, has signed a two-year deal to move on a free transfer and link up for a second time with Hughes, who he played under at Manchester City.
"Shay will not only be a great asset on the pitch as an outstanding goalkeeper but he's also a fantastic character to have in the dressing room and around the club," said Hughes.
"He's a true professional."
The Republic of Ireland international, who has 129 caps, is Stoke's fifth signing of the summer after defender Philipp Wollscheid, goalkeeper Jakob Haugaard and striker Joselu.
Given's signing comes amid speculation Stoke goalkeeper Asmir Begovic is wanted by Premier League champions Chelsea.
