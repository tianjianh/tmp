Wentworth Primary School pupil's SATs results annulled

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Exam results at a Rotherham school have been thrown out after pupils were "over-aided" during the tests and their answers changed.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
SATS results for all Year 6 students at Wentworth Primary Church of England School were annulled following an investigation by the Standards and Testing Agency (STA).
The chair of governors maintained pupils' education was unaffected.
The STA said "maladministration" of the tests was "completely unacceptable".
In a letter to parents Jane Collier, chair of governors, said: "Allegations were made to the STA that children had been over-aided during the test and the findings from the review of test papers showed amendments to answers had been made which were in line with the allegations.
"This means your child will not receive any results for the examinations taken this term."
Ms Collier stated the school's management and governing body were "very disappointed by this and share your frustrations in this matter".
She reassured parents all pupils would transfer to secondary school "without any prejudice".
"We have been assured by Rotherham Council that the secondary schools this school feeds into do their own assessments for children anyway when they enter year seven in September."
An investigator will be appointed "from outside of the borough" to lead a joint independent review with the  council and Diocese of Sheffield.
One parent, who did not wish to be named, said she had "lost faith" in the school's management team.
"I'm absolutely appalled and disgusted," she said.
"Our children have worked really hard all year and have got nothing to show for it."
A STA spokesperson said: "Following an investigation into the administration of the 2016 Key Stage 2 tests at Wentworth Church of England Junior and Infant School, â€Žall results have been annulled."
All Year 2 and Year 6 pupils sit national curriculum tests, known as Sats, in a range of subjects.
