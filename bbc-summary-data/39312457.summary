[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Fleetwood dropped another two points in the race for automatic promotion from League One as they drew at lowly Bury.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Cod Army slipped out of the top two last week after being held to a goalless draw at home to AFC Wimbledon.
And although Kyle Dempsey hit a post for Fleetwood, they now trail second-placed Bolton by six points.
Bobby Grant hit a first-half shot straight at Shakers keeper Joe Murphy before Dempsey fired against the inside of a Bury post from just outside the box.
Bury's James Vaughan headed over from a Jermaine Pennant free-kick after the break, while Cian Bolger missed a header for Fleetwood.
Dempsey's cross then deflected inches wide off Bury midfielder Jacob Mellis while Ashley Hunter fired wide after cutting in from the right.
But the hosts went closest to winning it as Hallam Hope dragged a shot wide and Greg Leigh fired straight at Alex Cairns.
