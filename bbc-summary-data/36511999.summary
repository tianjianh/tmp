The stone memorial is on the banks of Llyn Egnant - one of the famous Teifi pools - near the village of Ffair Rhos in Ceredigion.
He died last year at the age of 86.
A prominent figure in the Welsh fishing community, Mr Morgan once took the former US President Jimmy Carter on a fishing trip in mid Wales and they became great friends.
The stone memorial was unveiled by his widow, Julia Morgan.
He was described as the "grand-daddy of game angling in Wales" by Cheryl Bulman, of Tregaron Angling Association, which is celebrating its centenary year.
She said that Mr Morgan, the Teifi River and Tregaron Angling Association were "intrinsically linked".
