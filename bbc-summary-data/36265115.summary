This is the first time in the dressage event's 66-year history that a day has been cancelled due to the weather.
About 10,000 people, including the Queen were expected to attend Wednesday's event.
Organisers have said that they will make a decision on whether the event can go ahead on Thursday.
Waterlogged fields which would have been used as car parks for the event have been deemed unusable.
Marketing manager for the event Jo Peck said that Wednesday's cancellation was "disappointing" but it is hoped that the remaining four days will go ahead as planned.
She said: "We're doing the right thing because if we can keep [Wednesday] clear we will have a show for the next four days.
"We're doing refunds for anyone who has bought tickets today, so those should go through automatically."
Although attempts were made to contact visitors, people with horse boxes were being turned away at about 09:00 BST.
In celebration of the Queen's 90th birthday, there will be a parade of 900 horses in the private grounds of Windsor Castle on Thursday.
The event will celebrate the Queen's love of horses and the parade is expected to go ahead.
