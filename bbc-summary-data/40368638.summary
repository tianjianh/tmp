The 47-year-old from Royton, Oldham was among 22 people who died in the suicide bombing at Manchester Arena on 22 May.
She was killed while waiting in the foyer to pick up her daughter with her friend, Alison Howe, who also died and whose funeral took place earlier at the same church - St Anne's in Oldham.
Her daughter India said she was the "best mum in the universe".
Mrs Lees' mother, Elaine Hunter, said: "You were an inspiration to all and should have had a great life ahead of you... don't know how we will go on without you but I know you would want us to."
Hundreds of mourners lined the street as the white and pink butterfly-adorned coffin arrived, pulled by two white horses.
Beside the coffin, white roses were arranged to spell the words "mum" and "daughter".
Mrs Lees' husband Anthony and her two daughters, India and Lauren, were comforted by the vicar outside the church.
The service heard how she had worked at Oldham College as a beauty tutor and recently studied for a degree.
The Revd James Read said: "She had so many plans for the future but she was taken on that awful, awful day."
Lisa's husband Anthony cuddled daughters India and Lauren as their mother's coffin was brought out from the horse-drawn hearse.
Many people attended the funerals of both Lisa and her friend Alison Howe.  They died together in the arena foyer as they waited for their two youngest daughters.
Alison's daughter Darcy, 15, was wrapped in a jacket and hugged by her stepbrother as Lisa's coffin was brought out.
Pearl Jam's song 'Black' rang out over loud speakers as many people left the church.
Dozens of single red roses and pink carnations were then thrown into the air and over the hearse as it pulled away.
In a sign of solidarity, both families are meeting for a picnic later to "honour two angels who represented the best of us".
He read a tribute from Lauren that said: "Our mum was not just a mum, she was also our best friend.
"As long as we have each other, part of her will be always with us.
"She will live in our hearts forever."
Mrs Lees had been with her husband Anthony for 23 years. He said she was "the best wife a man can have".
