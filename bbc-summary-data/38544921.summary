Nathan Ake will give Chelsea "options" according to manager Antonio Conte after he recalled the defender from his season-long loan spell at Bournemouth.

Dutchman Ake, 21, joined the Cherries on loan last June, and has scored three times in 12 games for them this season.
He has played 12 times for Chelsea since making his debut in 2012, but Conte said the club "is his home".
"He's showing he deserves to stay in a great team like Chelsea," added Conte. "He gives me important options".
Conte will be without central defender John Terry for Saturday's trip to Leicester after the club captain was sent off in their FA Cup third-round win over Peterborough.
Ake has been recalled with immediate effect and will also be eligible for Chelsea in the FA Cup as he did not feature in the competition for Bournemouth.
On Saturday, Bournemouth boss Eddie Howe said losing Ake would be "a huge blow".
"He's done so well. It is easier said than done to say we are going to go and recruit a player of a similar stature to Nathan," Howe added.
"With Simon Francis' suspension and Marc Pugh's injury and now Nathan going back, our defensive resources are certainly stretched."
Conte's side top the Premier League and currently have the second-best defence in the top-tier, conceding 15 goals this season, one more than Tottenham.
The Blues currently have 37 players out on loan.
