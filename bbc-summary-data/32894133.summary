Anglesey golf course could remain open in council U-turn

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An Anglesey golf course that was facing closure could remain open for a further two years, the council has said.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Anglesey council's executive committee decided to close Llangefni Golf Course in January citing annual losses.
But on Tuesday the council agreed in principle to transfer the management to a local social enterprise group.
The council said it would now enter into "detailed negotiations" for Partneriaeth Llangefni to manage the facility until April 2017.
