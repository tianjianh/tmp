Liverpool defender Mamadou Sakho has said he is fit to play for the Premier League side.

Reds manager Jurgen Klopp has previously said that the 26-year-old, who has not played since April, was not ready to play first-team football.
However, the France international said on social media that he had finished all his rehabilitation work.
"I accept my situation but I can't accept the lie - the fans deserve to know the truth," he said.
"Now it's three weeks since I am fit to play games. I finish all my rehabilitation work."
Sakho had a doping case against him dismissed by Uefa in May.
He was then sent home from Liverpool's pre-season tour of the United States in July after being late on three occasions.
"I will speak soon for the people who support me and don't understand the situation," Sakho added.
He also claimed the club did not want him to play with the reserves either - "why, I don't know," he added.
Sakho has made 55 appearances for Liverpool since joining them from Paris St-Germain in 2013.
