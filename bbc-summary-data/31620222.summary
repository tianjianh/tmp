[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Dutch rail operator will run ScotRail services from April after securing the franchise in October.
It will take over from Aberdeen-based FirstGroup, which has run most Scottish rail services for the past 10 years.
Representatives from Abellio met with members of Highlands and Islands transport body Hitrans in Inverness earlier.
A feasibility study into how best to upgrade the station is to be completed by March of next year.
The station was constructed and added to during the 1800s. The pitched iron and glass roof over the concourse was built in 1876.
Automatic ticket gates similar to those at stations in Aberdeen, Dundee, Edinburgh and Glasgow, were installed last year.
Hitrans vice-chairman Thomas Prag welcomed Abellio's commitment to put "significant investment" into the station.
