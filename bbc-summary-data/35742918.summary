The man, who is aged in his 40s, was taken to hospital with serious injuries after the attack at a house in Vicarage Hill, Westerham, on Sunday.
Kent Police said the injuries inflicted by the dogs were not life threatening.
Officers in riot gear contained the animals in one room of the property before they were removed.
The animals were then sedated by specialists, assisted by an RSPCA inspector and an independent vet.
Firearms officers were called to the scene and the road outside the property was closed temporarily to "ensure public safety".
In a statement, Kent Police said the dogs, believed to be bullmastiffs, belonged to the man's friend.
It added: "Five dogs believed to be bullmastiffs have been safely removed from the property and work to ensure their welfare is ongoing by police and partner agencies.
"We are managing the dogs' welfare but it is too soon to say what will happen to them."
