Rio 2016: Pat McCormack and Josh Kelly qualify for Olympics

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Josh Kelly and Pat McCormack will be part of Great Britain's biggest boxing team for an Olympics after winning their quarter-final bouts at the qualifiers in Baku, Azerbaijan.

Welterweight Kelly outpointed Aaron Prince (Trinidad & Tobago) and light welterweight McCormack won a unanimous decision over Hassan Amsile (France).
It means GB have qualified a fighter in each of the 10 men's divisions for Rio.
That rules out any professional boxer fighting for Britain at the Games.
The team will be made up of 10 men and two women and is the first time in recent Games history that Great Britain has qualified a man in every available weight class.
The wins ensured Kelly and McCormack, who are both from the north east of England, met the qualification standard by guaranteeing a place in the top five in Baku.
"It's an unreal feeling," McCormack said. "I was frustrated not to do it in Turkey at the first qualifier but always had faith in my ability and this time I made sure."
Kelly added: "I have had a few injury problems over the last year and there were times when the Olympics looked a long way off, so to know that I will be on that plane to Rio with the rest of the team is just brilliant."
The full team of boxers that will compete for Great Britain in Rio is:
Men
Women
