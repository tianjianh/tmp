Yaya Toure escapes driving ban for 101mph speeding offence

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Manchester City footballer Yaya Toure has escaped a driving ban despite admitting speeding up to 101mph on a motorway in a turbo-charged Porsche.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 32-year-old Ivory Coast international drove at excessive speed on a northbound stretch of the M6 near Keele services on 20 May.
Toure was fined, ordered to pay costs, and given six penalty points at Burton Magistrates' Court in Staffordshire.
Prosecutors dropped a more serious allegation of speeding at 123mph.
Toure had been expected to appear in court for what was due to be his trial, having previously denied the more serious allegation of speeding during the same incident.
However, the midfielder was instead represented by his solicitor, Gwyn Lewis, who told magistrates the footballer "apologised for his behaviour".
In mitigation, Mr Lewis said: "The car comes from Germany, has a German registration, rather than a normal registration, and unfortunately for my client it was a vehicle which had I think not got the correct speedometer - it was showing kilometres [per hour] in terms of miles."
Toure was fined Â£1,665 and ordered to pay an additional Â£335 in costs and charges.
