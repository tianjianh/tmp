[SN]TITLE[SN]
Sections of new bridge on River Ness lifted into place

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Sections of a new crossing on the River Ness in Inverness have been lowered into place.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Work on the bridge for the city's new West Link road was suspended earlier this week because of high winds.
A large crane is being used to lift sections of the crossing into place over the river.
The West Link is also under construction. Highland Council hopes that once completed it will ease congestion in the city centre.
It will form a link between the A9, A96 and A82 trunk roads.
