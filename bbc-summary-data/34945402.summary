The elite soldiers of the Galactic Empire swapped enforcing the New Order to try out the waves in a drizzly Gloucestershire.
It is thought key scenes from the upcoming Star Wars: Episode VII The Force Awakens were filmed in nearby Puzzlewood, in the Forest of Dean.
The Wye Valley and Forest of Dean Tourism Association seized the link to invite the "stormtroopers" to advertise its new television and movie trail.
The area has also starred in dozens of productions from Dr Who and The Huntsman to Harry Potter.
"We thought it would be fun to swap the Death Star for surfboards and see if the soldiers of the Galactic Empire could ride the waves," said Mark Terry-Lush, association director.
"It was the last big bore of the season and it was a decent bore - so we were really lucky."
A bore is a surge wave caused by the incoming tide being funnelled up the narrowing estuary.
The association's TV and Movie Trail website is due go live on 16 December.
