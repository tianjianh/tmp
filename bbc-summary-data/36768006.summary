Man charged with 1992 Nottingham bus stop rape and abduction

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man has been charged with abducting a teenager from a bus stop and raping her twice on the same night 24 years ago.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The woman was standing in Mansfield Road, Nottingham, on 25 October 1992 when she was taken against her will.
Christopher Robert Scott, now 63, of Billesdon Drive, Heathfield, was arrested by police on Saturday.
He appeared at Nottingham Magistrates' Court charged with two counts of rape, one count of abduction, and robbing the woman of about Â£7 in cash.
Mr Scott was released on bail to appear at the city's crown court on 8 August.
There was a high-profile appeal for information about the attack when it happened, and it featured on Crimewatch in 2008, but no charges had been brought.
