Former Motherwell man O'Brien, 26, was available after turning down a new contract with Barnsley.
Swanson, 27, played 47 times for Peterborough last season but rejected a new deal with the Posh.
On Swanson boss Steven Pressley told the club website: "We weren't the only club looking to sign him so to get a deal done is great news."
Pressley added of O'Brien: "He is a player of proven Championship quality and his energy, work rate and team ethic along with that quality makes him a perfect fit for us."
The Scottish duo are the first players to join the Sky Blues this summer.
