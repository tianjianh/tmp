A £5,000 reward has been offered to help solve a seven-year mystery of how a father of two vanished during a night out in a pub in Cambridgeshire.

Terry McSpadden was 24 when he went missing after leaving a Wisbech pub and police now believe he is dead.
His family said his two children "still miss their daddy".
The last sighting of Mr McSpadden was at the Locomotive pub at 01:00 GMT on 2 March 2007 when he said he was going home to nearby Elm but never arrived.
Crimestoppers has put up a £5,000 reward to try to solve his disappearance.
Det Insp Marie James, of Norfolk Police, said: "While Terry's disappearance was initially treated as a missing person inquiry, we have long since believed that Terry is no longer alive and his death was as the result of foul play.
"His body has never been found.
"We believe there are other people with important information who may have previously not felt able to come forward."
Mr McSpadden was known as a reliable and hard worker with strong local ties.
Det Insp James said: "His family deserve answers and we need to bring those responsible to justice.
"We are asking people who have the information to have the courage to come forward."
Mr McSpadden's mother, Helen Thrower, said: "The grief doesn't get any easier.
"We have had laughter and tears with people reminiscing about Terry - such lovely memories about a truly missed son."
His stepmother Susan Rolfe said: "Terry's children miss their daddy and really want him to come home.
"It is like living in a nightmare. Somebody must know something that will help us establish what happened seven years ago."
A man was charged with murder in 2011 but the case against him was later dismissed, with the judge in the case at Norwich Crown Court citing insufficient evidence.
