A house designed by Turner Prize-winning artist Grayson Perry has attracted so many sightseers that roads leading to it are being redesigned.

The conceptual holiday home in Wrabness, Essex, which is yet to be finished, has been built at the end of a narrow cul-de-sac.
Residents say motorists have flocked to the area and caused traffic problems on narrow roads near the site.
Essex Highways has agreed to carry out works to relieve the situation.
One resident, who asked not be named, said the issues had been "significant" and people living in the area were bracing themselves for the warmer months when even more visitors were expected.
Wrabness Parish Council said: "Residents have been beset by problems such as access and egress to their properties, conflicting vehicle movements, inconsiderate parking and awkward manoeuvring."
As well as new signs and road markings, talks will be held with the operator of the railway station car park to see whether it could be used by visitors to the Grayson Perry house.
Carlo Guglielmi, Essex County Council's member for Tendring Rural West, said: "It is an iconic thing and it is beautiful to have it here in Tendring. But we've always had concerns about access.
"The enhancement measures agreed will greatly improve Wrabness's residents everyday life."
The 54-year-old artist designed the building, also known as Julie's House, along with FAT architecture in homage to the "single mums in Dagenham, hairdressers in Colchester, and the landscape and history of Essex".
Mr Perry is yet to comment on the matter.
