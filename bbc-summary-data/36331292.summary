Hampshire bowler Chris Wood has been ruled out for the rest of the season with a knee injury.

Wood sustained the injury whilst bowling against Middlesex in the County Championship on 4 May.
"It is a blow to us, he has been influential in our one-day cricket and we will miss him," Hampshire's director of cricket Giles White told BBC Radio Solent.
The 25-year-old left-arm seamer underwent surgery last week.
Wood is the latest Hampshire bowler to succumb to long-term injury this season, with Fidel Edwards, Reece Topley and Gareth Berg all currently sidelined.
Topley was injured on his Hampshire debut against Warwickshire in April.
Hampshire recently signed Tino Best, Craig Young and ex-Worcestershire seamer Gareth Andrew on a match-by-match basis to alleviate their injury concerns.
