Hoggard, 40, took 248 wickets in 68 Tests for England and also played for Yorkshire and Leicestershire.
He will work to head coach Sall Briggs for the 2017 WSL competition.
"There is a massive amount of talent in the women's game, coupled with the tenacity and desire to improve," said Hoggard.
"I'm massively looking forward to helping the team get more game aware and to reach their full potential."
Briggs, who worked with England under-19 women's development programme before taking over at Loughborough added: "Matthew's a great addition to our coaching staff; his experience and knowledge will be invaluable to our bowling unit.
"His presence has already brought excitement to our environment and the girls are keen to learn as much as they can."
