[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
It's the question that lots of scientists want to find out - is there life on another solar system or galaxy?

The Square Kilometre Array project is aiming to find that out, using a huge radio telescope in South Africa and Australia.
When it's finished, it will be the most powerful radio telescope in the world and will be able to detect a signal from a planet that is tens of light years away.
The telescope will listen for intelligent life and the data collected will be processed by countries, including the UK, where experts will look for any signs of life.
Scientists hope they will be able to detect life on other planets if they also have radio signals on their planet.
But it could be a lengthy process, as the signals could take years to reach another civilisation and years for them to come back to Earth.
