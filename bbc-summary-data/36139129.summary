[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Former Ivory Coast international defender Kolo Toure has said he will stay at Liverpool only if he is able to make a contribution to the team.

The 35-year-old will be out of contract at the end of this season but manager Jurgen Klopp has hinted the player figures in his future plans.
"It's great to hear that from a great manager," Toure told BBC Sport.
"As long as I can bring something [to the team] I'm happy to stay but if I can't, there is no point."
Toure has largely been among the substitutes this season but started Saturday's 2-2 draw with Newcastle, having replaced Mamadou Sakho following the Frenchman's omission over a failed drugs test.
Sakho has not been suspended following the notification that Uefa is investigating an alleged anti-doping violation but Toure looks set to retain his place in the Liverpool starting line-up for Thursday's Europa League tie at Villarreal.
Toure himself failed a drugs test while at former club Manchester City in 2011, testing positive for endroflumethiazide, a weight-loss drug contained within 'water tablets', and was banned for six months.
"I don't want to remember that because it has been tough for me. I don't even want to talk about that because it is very hard," Toure said.
"Right now I haven't spoken with Mama, to be honest. I've been in there and it has been really difficult, definitely.
"This is private but he knows what I think about him."
