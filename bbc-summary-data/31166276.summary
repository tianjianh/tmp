Brymbo Heritage Group (BHG) is working with partners including The Prince's Regeneration Trust (PRT) in a bid to breathe life into historic buildings at the former Brymbo steelworks.
The sprawling complex employed almost 2,500 people at its peak but it closed in 1990 after almost 200 years.
Some of the land has been redeveloped.
The group hopes to re-use nine old buildings, creating a heritage centre, learning facilities, business units, shops and apartments as well as open spaces.
The site is also home to a 300 million-year-old fossil forest uncovered in 2005.
Experts are meeting with the heritage group and members of the public next week to take the plans forward. A public meeting is also due to be held on Thursday 12 February at 18:00 GMT.
