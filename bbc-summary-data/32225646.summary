Russia have been given a 3-0 win over Montenegro by forfeit following the abandonment of their Euro 2016 qualifier in Podgorica.

Uefa has ordered Montenegro to play their next home tie in an empty stadium and pay a 50,000 euros (£36,000) fine.
Russia keeper Igor Akinfeev was struck on the head by a flare in the first minute, and taken off on a stretcher.
The match was delayed by 30 minutes, and abandoned in the second half after a brawl involving players and staff.
The Russian Football Union was also fined 25,000 euros (£18,000) for improper conduct by its supporters, which included the throwing of flares and other missiles.
The Group G clash at the Gradski Stadion was stopped for the final time when fighting broke out between the two teams after Russia midfielder Roman Shirokov's penalty was saved and team-mate Dmitri Kombarov was struck by a missile.
Meanwhile, Croatia's crucial Euro 2016 qualifier against Italy in June will also be behind closed doors as punishment for fans setting off fireworks, throwing missiles and racist behaviour in their 5-1 win over Norway last month in Zagreb.
Croatia, who are two points clear of Italy at the top of Group H, were also fined 50,000 euros (£36,000).
