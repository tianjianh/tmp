Bristol Rugby has unveiled plans for a "top-class" new training centre.

The club has applied for permission to develop a 23-acre site on Beggar Bush Lane, Failand.
Plans include three grass training pitches, an all-weather 4G floodlit pitch and an indoor half-pitch training barn.
Chairman Chris Booy said the development "underlines our ambitions to be one of the leading clubs in the country".
"It's vital that we have a top-class facility for the squad to train at, not just to drive performance but also to attract the calibre of players we want at the club," he added.
"We already have the fantastic stadium at Ashton Gate and now the planning process has begun with North Somerset Council to build a training centre that matches those high standards."
Last week the club sacked head coach Andy Robinson after the board "lost confidence" that he would be able to retain the club's Premiership position.
Mark Tainton was appointed as acting head coach.
Former South Africa and Leicester boss Heyneke Meyer is a leading contender to replace Robinson, but no deal has been finalised at this stage.
