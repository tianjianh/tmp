WW2 St Nazaire Tirpitz attack instigator gets plaque

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An army officer who died during a successful attack he instigated on a German battleship during World War Two has been honoured with a plaque in Cardiff.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Capt William Pritchard was killed when British forces blew up Normandy Dock, St Nazaire, in 1942, in a bid to prevent the Tirpitz leaving.
The attack put the dock and the Tirpitz out of action until after the war.
The battleship was later sunk off the coast of Norway.
Royal Engineer Capt Pritchard, of Llandaff, came up with the plan after witnessing the bombing of Cardiff docks in 1941.
RAF bombs were not accurate enough to hit the gate of Normandy Dock in the French port from afar so he devised a plan to blow it up from the inside.
He remodelled an old ship - HMS Campbeltown - to look like a German vessel and placed a four-and-a-half tonne bomb on board.
Training for the mission took place at Cardiff docks.
The plaque was unveiled at a short ceremony in Llandaff on Wednesday.
On the night of 28 March 1942, HMS Campbeltown made it part way up the Loire estuary before the Germans detected it.
But it managed to reach the dock and the British commandos onboard off-loaded and began destroying what they could.
Hours after it was supposed to have destroyed the gates, the bomb on HMS Campbeltown had still not blown.
The Germans, not realising explosives were on board, had begun a tour of the ship, when just before midday the next day, it finally detonated.
Nearly 170 British servicemen, including Capt Pritchard were killed in the attack.
Many survivors were captured and spent the rest of the war as prisoners at Colditz.
To mark his contribution to the mission, known as Operation Chariot, The Llandaff Society, Royal Engineers in Cardiff and St Nazaire Society funded the plaque in Capt Pritchard's honour.
