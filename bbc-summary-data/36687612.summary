[SN]TITLE[SN]
Five-star Scotsman Hotel in Edinburgh goes into liquidation

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An Edinburgh five-star hotel has gone into liquidation.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs (HMRC) filed for a winding up order against The Scotsman Hotel, on North Bridge in May.
Edinburgh Sheriff Court then appointed liquidator, French Duncan.
However, the owners, JJW Hotels, said last minute negotiations meant the hotel would continue to trade and there were no plans for 150 staff to lose their jobs.
Eileen Blackburn, partner and head of business recovery and insolvency at French Duncan, said: "The Scotsman Hotel is continuing to trade and there are no plans for that to stop.
"French Duncan are working with the hotel's senior management team to ensure that trading continues and to find a long term sustainable solution."
