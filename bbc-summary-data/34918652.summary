South Wales Police was called to Trem-Y-Cwm House flats in Beddau, Rhondda Cynon Taff, at about 13:00 GMT on Tuesday.
The man, who has not been identified, was wrapped up but not buried.
Det Supt Paul Hurley said the "priority" was to identify the man.
A post-mortem examination will be carried out on Wednesday to determine the cause of death.
Det Supt Hurley added: "We would appeal for anyone who has concerns for the welfare of a male friend, relative or neighbour who has, uncharacteristically, not been seen or heard from in a number of weeks to get in touch with us."
Police are continuing house-to-house inquiries and a cordon outside flats 54 to 57 remains in place. Forensic officers have been to the scene with a white police tent erected at the side of the flats.
Nearby residents said they were shocked by the news.
Mother-of-two Andrea Phillips, 61, said: "Everyone is stunned to hear there's been a murder. A lot of elderly and disabled people live in those flats. God forbid it's someone from there.
"It's awful news to hear really. It's a shock. I don't think it's quite sunk in yet."
An elderly woman living in a flat nearby, who did not want to be named, said:  "It's awful to look out of my window and to think someone's body has been lying there."
