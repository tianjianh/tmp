A nationwide TV appeal for information after a teenager was raped twice by a gang of youths in a Cardiff park prompted a number of "positive calls".

The victim was walking home after a night out when she was approached by the gang of five to six - of similar age - who ushered her into Gabalfa Park in the early hours of 17 October.
Police made an appeal on BBC1's Crimewatch programme on Thursday.
Officers will now follow up a number of the calls from members of the public.
After a reconstruction of the run-up to the attack was shown on the programme, Det Insp Lloyd Williams said: "I'm pleased with the calls which have come in from the local community.
"They've given us positive lines of inquiry which we will be actioning immediately."
He appealed for people to come forward including "the bystanders in the gang itself, anyone who has been confided in and the local community".
He said the members of the gang were described as males, two of whom were on bikes. All were wearing dark clothing apart from one who was wearing grey.
Anyone with information should call South Wales Police on 029 2052 7248.
