[SN]TITLE[SN]
Carlisle United 3-0 Cheltenham Town

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Carlisle United cruised to a comfortable win over Cheltenham to register their first home win of the League Two campaign.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Harry Pell's own goal and a Reggie Lambe header in the first half virtually settled the issue and defender Tom Miller put the outcome beyond doubt with a second-half strike.
Carlisle's first attack produced a fifth-minute goal as Shaun Miller forced a corner and Danny Grainger's inswinger from the right had the Cheltenham defence panicked.
In the ensuing scramble, Pell's attempted clearance flew past his own goalkeeper Jon Flatt and into the net.
The home team were on target again in the 17th minute when Grainger's cross from wide on the left picked out Lambe, who directed a stooping header into the bottom corner.
Carlisle made the most of the conditions in the first half, with a gusting wind at their backs, and Miller and Richie Bennett both were inches away from scoring.
At the other end, Pell almost made amends in a Robins break, forcing Jack Bonham to dive full length to save a fizzing low drive.
Carlisle continued to press after the break and made it 3-0 in the 60th minute when Cheltenham failed to clear a Nicky Adams free-kick and Miller seized on Tom Parkes' pass on the edge of the area to curl a shot into the top right-hand corner.
