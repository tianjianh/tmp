Denbigh hospital roof collapse prompts police warning

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A roof has collapsed at a former Victorian hospital in Denbighshire, prompting police to label the site "dangerous" and advise people to stay away.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The derelict North Wales Hospital in Denbigh has been at the centre of a long-running dispute over its future.
On-duty police officers saw the roof collapse when they attended the scene responding to reports of trespassers.
It failed to sell at auction in May after its Â£2.25m price was not met.
