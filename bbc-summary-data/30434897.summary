[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
One of the oldest hydro-electric power stations in Wales has been switched back on following a £15m revamp.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The facility in the Conwy Valley village of Dolgarrog has been upgraded by RWE Innogy UK.
First Minister Carwyn Jones officially turned on the turbine and pipeline on Thursday.
He said the project safeguarded the power station and would economically benefit the area.
The hydro-electric plant has been operating for nearly a century, after originally being built to power an aluminium smelter in the village.
