[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A number of routes have been blocked by accidents and vehicles stuck in snow in southern Scotland.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
At one stage 50 cars were reportedly stuck on the A7 between Langholm and Longtown.
The A701 was also blocked near the Forest of Ae by a tanker and HGV but was also later cleared.
Problems on the A68 near Jedburgh were cleared but conditions remained hazardous. One woman was cut free from her vehicle on the A698 near Denholm.
She was treated by ambulance personnel.
The yellow warning of snow was in place until 17:00 on Friday and covered much of Dumfries and Galloway and the Scottish Borders.
Problems were also reported in the Hawick area with the A7 described as being at a "standstill" by local MSP John Lamont.
Scottish Borders Council advised people in the area only to use their cars if absolutely necessary.
Drivers were also advised to slow down on the A74(M) south of Moffat after two lorries were involved in an accident there.
Disruption was also possible on the A76 south of Kirkconnel due to a crash.
Ch Insp Andy McLean, area commander for the Scottish Borders, added: "Motorists should drive to the conditions and maintain safe stopping distances, bearing in mind that in snow or ice these are significantly greater than in the dry."
