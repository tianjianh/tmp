Belfast: Pair charged over 'nightly riots' at Bryson Street interface

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A 21-year-old man and a 17-year-old youth have appeared in court charged in connection with nightly rioting at a sectarian interface in east Belfast.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The court was told there have been 85 public order incidents at Bryson Street interface over the past 18 nights.
Gary Kirkwood, from Island Street in east Belfast, and his co-accused, who cannot be named because of his age, were charged with riotous behaviour.
The youth was also charged with having a petrol bomb and other offences.
Belfast Magistrates' Court heard police had deployed a large amount of resources into the interface area because of the nightly attacks and a constable objected to Mr Kirkwood being released on bail.
"Since June 19 there have been 85 public order incidents in the interface area at Bryson Street," the officer said.
"However, since the defendant's arrest last night [Monday] there have been no further incidents. Police would have concerns that he has influence over people in the area if he was released on bail.''
She asked that Mr Kirkwood be remanded in custody as police had concerns that if he lived at an address outside east Belfast, that he would "still be able to travel into the area''.
The court heard that a PSNI officer who had known Mr Kirkwood for a number of years had identified him on CCTV footage as being present in the area of Bryson Street.
But a defence solicitor argued none of the CCTV footage showed his client "throwing any stones''.
The judge ruled Mr Kirkwood would be released on bail, subject to strict conditions, and ordered him to stay out of Belfast and all licensed premises.
He must live at an address in Newtownabbey, County Antrim; abide by a 19:00 BST night-time curfew; was banned from drinking alcohol and must sign bail at a police station three times a week.
Police did not object to bail for his 17-year-old co-accused, who was also ordered to obey a curfew and stay away from the Belfast interface.
The judge also ruled that the youth could only be in the company of three people if supervised by his mother.
