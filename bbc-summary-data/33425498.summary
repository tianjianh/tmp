The authority confirmed Sandra Stockdale had joined the Conservatives with immediate effect.
Council leader Donna Jones tweeted: "Delighted to announce Cllr Sandra Stockdale has quit the @LibDems and joined the @Conservatives."
Ms Stockdale said she had recently "felt uncomfortable" with the Lib Dems.
The councillor, who represents St Thomas ward, said she had been considering the move for about three months.
She added: "I was recently deselected which takes away any future I have with the group.
"I didn't have their support obviously, so I decided to resign."
Her move brings the total number of Conservatives to 19. There are 14 Liberal Democrats, four Labour, four UKIP and one independent.
The council is run as a minority Conservative administration.
