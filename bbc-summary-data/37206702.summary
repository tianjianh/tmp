Hal Robson-Kanu's failure to find a club could affect his chances of starting Wales' World Cup qualifier against Moldova, says Chris Coleman.

The Euro 2016 semi-finalists begin their Group D campaign at Cardiff City Stadium on 5 September.
Robson-Kanu, who left Reading in the summer, has not played a game since Euro 2016 and Wales boss Coleman was emphatic when asked if the forward's lack of a club would affect selection.
"Yes, of course," he said.
"We know what he's capable of. But I will know when they're all with us. In the training sessions and the preparation I'll know who's really on it ready [to play].
"I'll look at the players, see who's ready physically and psychologically. If I have to upset one or two it's not the first time I've done it."
Robson-Kanu, 27, scored twice as Wales reached the last four of Euro 2016 and has been linked with Premier League sides Hull City and Crystal Palace.
Coleman says there can be no excuses for Wales ahead of the Moldova game, irrespective of who is fit and available for selection.
Crystal Palace's Jonny Williams and Arsenal's Aaron Ramsey have already been ruled out.
"We've threatened before, promised everything and then delivered nothing," said Coleman.
"How many times have we finished strong at the end of one campaign and we say the next one is going to be the one? Then wallop, nothing.
"So this first game - doesn't matter if it's home or away - you set your stall out, set down a marker. That's what we're going for."
