As part of their inquiry into the issue across the country they will study the labour market in the south of Scotland.
The committee will look at the role access to finance, infrastructure and government support plays in supporting key employment sectors.
It will take evidence from a range of organisations from across Dumfries and Galloway and the Scottish Borders.
Pete Wishart, who chairs the committee, said: "We have come to Dumfries today because it is important that sustainable employment is for the whole country and not just the major cities in the central belt.
"Our previous report found that the historic decline in population remains a modern issue for some western and rural areas.
"We want to understand how this will affect businesses and employment opportunities in the south of Scotland."
He said he was keen to hear from local businesses about the challenges they faced in attracting employees and remaining competitive.
"We will also be hearing from local government and Scottish Enterprise about what can be done to attract new employers and develop the local economy," he added.
The committee meeting is being held at the Easterbrook Hall in Dumfries.
