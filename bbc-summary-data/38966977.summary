Tristan Biddlecombe, 24, and his wife Enderlein, 20, both of East Street, Harwich, are accused of washing and burning clothing worn by Mr Swift and and Mr Smith with the intention of impeding their apprehension and prosecution.
The jury has been shown an interview Mr Smith's girlfriend Imogen Porley gave to the police.
She said Mr Smith told her he and Mr Swift had gone out on 31 July and "beat someone up".
Describing Mr Swift, Ms Porley told police he was "obsessed" with guns and described him as "mental".
When she met him on 2 August, according to her interview, Mr Smith told her: "Me and Scott went out and did someone in. You've got to be my alibi. You've got to tell them we went for a walk."
She said Mr Smith told her Mr Scott was beating a man with a metal pole.
The trial continues.
