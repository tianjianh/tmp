Norton in Hales scooped the Royal Horticultural Award title at a ceremony in Sunderland.
Judges praised the excellent green spaces and variety of plants in the "beautiful, picturesque" village.
The village was one of 70 finalists chosen from more than 1,000 groups across the country.
Last year Shrewsbury took the title.
This year judges said the variety of plants in Norton in Hales had made a "tremendous impact", particularly on the village green and sports field.
They said its commitment to the environment and sustainability "played a large part in their success", praising projects such as "ground to ground" which sees coffee granules and bark mulch transformed into fertiliser and slug repellent.
The "exceptional" community spirit of Norton in Bloom volunteers was also mentioned with judges adding the "entire village" had won the title which was announced at a ceremony on Friday.
Norton in Bloom Secretary Malcolm McDonald said it was an "amazing achievement" for a village of some 300 people and reflected the hard work of the committee and its many helpers.
Birmingham achieved a gold award at Britain in Bloom and won the "Large Town" category while Walsall took silver in the Urban Community section.
