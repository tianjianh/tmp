A mass dance warm-up took place at Saundersfoot before the swimmers braved the sea, cheered on by thousands of spectators.
Pembrokeshire-born adventurer Tori James, the first Welsh woman to climb Mount Everest, was on hand to start the swim.
Now in its 32rd year, the event has raised more than Â£500,000 for charity.
Highlights among the fancy dress included a large Star Wars Millennium Falcon and Mrs Brown's Boys.
