Police also found chemicals, ammunition and a gun across 12 separate locations in Larne in a joint operation between the PSNI and the Metropolitan Police.
The searches follow the arrest of Royal Marine CiarÃ¡n Maxwell in connection with alleged dissident republicanism.
Mr Maxwell is accused of terror, fraud and drug offences.
The 30-year-old, originally from Larne, has denied the fraud and drug offences.
He has not yet been asked to enter a plea in relation to the terror charge.
He will appear again in court on 19 September in relation to all charges.
PSNI Assistant Chief Constable Will Kerr thanked the "community of Larne for their patience" during the searches, which began on 24 August.
"The searches were part of a joint, ongoing, police operation between PSNI and the Metropolitan Police Service in London," he said.
"I am aware of the disruption this has caused to local residents and am extremely grateful for their cooperation and understanding.
"However, as I am sure the people living in Larne will understand, we will take no chances where their safety is concerned and, as a result of the significant terrorist material recovered, I am confident that the area, and Northern Ireland in general, is safer as a result. "
