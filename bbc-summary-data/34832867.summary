Derby County captain Chris Baird is keen to get more game time with his club before Northern Ireland's Euro 2016 finals campaign in France.

The versatile Baird is an important part of Michael O'Neill's international squad but has not been playing regularly for his Championship team in recent weeks.
"It's just a case of waiting and biding my time," the 33-year-old said.
"It's a matter of waiting for my chance and then taking it when it comes."
Baird has spoken to manager Paul Clement about his role with the Rams, having been installed as captain on his arrival at Pride Park in the summer.
After starting the season at right-back, Baird has made just two substitute appearances since the start of October.
With his country heading to their first major tournament for 30 years, he is mindful of the need for game time but knows he is not far from the first XI.
"Me and the manager have had a few chats and I understand where he's coming from because he doesn't want to change a winning team," he said.
"Obviously it's frustrating but I've been in this position before, though not as the captain which is a bit stranger. The main thing is the boys are winning and playing really well.
"God forbid injuries happen, but you'll have suspensions and so on. It's a long season in the Championship, so I expect to play.
"If it didn't and it was nearing the end of the season, I'd maybe have to sort something out in terms of going out on loan. That's further down the line. A lot of things can happen."
