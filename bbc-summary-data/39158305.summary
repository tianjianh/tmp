An altercation took place in the city which resulted in the 28-year-old needing treatment after he was punched.
The full-back said on the club website: "I accept the consequences and regret that my time at Stuttgart has come to an end in this way."
Stuttgart coach Hannes Wolf said: "It's not an easy situation for any of us."
Grosskreutz, who won five caps, was an unused substitute during Germany's successful 2014 World Cup campaign in Brazil.
