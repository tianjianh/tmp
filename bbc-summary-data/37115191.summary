[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Jason Gates, 39, from Portsmouth, was reported missing on 17 March after his pet dog was found on farmland close to Drumnadrochit, near Loch Ness.
Portsmouth Coroner's Court was told Mr Gates died as a result of "paradoxical undressing" which caused him to strip off his clothes thinking he was hot.
Coroner David Horsley recorded a verdict of accidental death,
He said: "When people start to develop hypothermia they are actually cold but they feel hot and take their clothes off.
"I am entirely satisfied that Jason has died due to an accident."
Described by his family as a "gentle giant" he had gone on the walking holiday after suffering from stress at work.
His body was found in a forest at Cnoc A'Bhuachaille on 3 May.
The inquest heard that Mr Gates had a history of depression and had been seen by mental health services in recent months.
