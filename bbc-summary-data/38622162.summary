The Brazilian-born 27-year-old has been a first team regular since moving to Tynecastle from Portuguese side Maritimo in August 2015.
Rossi was due to be out of contract at the end of the season.
A club statement described the move as "an amazing opportunity for him and his family", adding that they "would not stand in his way".
Rossi is the second defender to leave Hearts this month, following Alim Ozturk's switch to Turkish club Boluspor, while full-back Callum Paterson is out for the rest of the season with knee ligament damage and Faycal Rherras will be at the Africa Cup of Nations with Morocco.
Veteran Northern Ireland international Aaron Hughes has been recruited, along with Lennard Sowah.
