Northern Ireland are to host a four-team Women's Under-19 tournament in October as part of preparations for next year's European Championships.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
England, France and the US will compete along with Northern Ireland in the event, which runs from 18-23 October.
The round-robin games will be at Ballymena Showgrounds, Mourneview Park in Lurgan, Portadown's Shamrock Park and the National Stadium in Belfast.
NI are the hosts of the Uefa Women's U19 Championship finals in August 2017.
Alfie Wylie, the Irish FA Women's coach said the mini-tournament, the International Women's Cup,  was a great opportunity for Northern Ireland's young women to play against some of the best teams in the world.
"The US women's national team are the current world champions and many of the young American girls taking part in next month's tournament will no doubt aspire to play in the full US women's team," said Wylie.
England and France have qualified for the Uefa Women's Under-19 Championship Finals 11 times, with France winning the overall title on four occasions and England winning it once.
