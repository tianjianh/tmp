Dozens of the world's top cyclists will speed into the Dumfries and Galloway town on Sunday 4 September.
An influx of up to 10,000 visitors is being predicted on the day.
Dumfries and Galloway Council's events champion Colin Smyth said he expected its investment in securing the race to be "returned ten-fold".
The opening stage of the Tour of Britain runs from Glasgow to Castle Douglas.
Mr Smyth said the final plans were in place to ensure everyone had a "memorable day out".
"There has never been a comparable event in our area for the broadcast coverage we will attract - more than 115 countries worldwide are taking syndicated pictures of the race," he said.
Michelle Robertson, of the Castle Douglas Development Forum, said she was sure visitors would enjoy the food stalls being set up specially for the day.
"Local businesses will also be open and embracing the crowds on King Street and serving the many visitors to the town culinary treats," she added.
Paul Bush of VisitScotland said it was good to see the level of support being given by local businesses to the race.
"The Tour of Britain, which is supported through EventScotland's International Funding Programme, will bring some of the world's finest cyclists to Glasgow, East Ayrshire and Dumfries and Galloway, and it's great to see the whole region getting behind the event," he said.
"Castle Douglas is going to be a hive of activity on race day following careful planning to ensure the perfect stage is set for the end of stage one.
"I'm sure thousands of locals and those travelling to view the event from further afield will turn out to welcome the riders home in style."
