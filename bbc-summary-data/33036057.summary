Former world number one Tiger Woods suffered his worst professional round with a 13-over-par 85 on day three of the Memorial Tournament in Ohio.

Woods, 39, now ranked 172, had made the cut by one shot but had consecutive double bogeys, six bogeys and finished with a quadruple-bogey eight.
It left the 14-time major winner in last place on 12 over for the event, which he has won five times.
He is 27 shots behind leader Justin Rose, who is three ahead after a 66.
World number six Rose, who won this event in 2010, posted seven birdies to reach 15 under.
Compatriot Andy Sullivan, the 29-year-old from Nuneaton who won two titles in South Africa earlier this year, was level with Rose at the top of the leaderboard but dropped five shots in seven holes on the back nine and is five adrift in a share of fifth place.
Woods has spent a record 683 combined weeks as world number one and was still top of the rankings as recently as May last year.
Saturday's round at Muirfield Village, a course at which he has triumphed on eight occasions, was only his third in the 80s.
The American found the water four times and eclipsed his previous worst, an 82 at the Phoenix Open in January.
Needing a par at the last to avoid his worst professional round, Woods drove into the water, saw a chip for his fourth shot roll back further away than when he started and his fifth was miscued into a greenside bunker.
Following his 82 in January, Woods played in the Farmers Insurance Open at Torrey Pines the next week but withdrew after 11 holes because of back trouble.
The following week he announced an indefinite break from golf, saying his game was "unacceptable for tournament play".
Having dropped outside the top 100 in the rankings for the first time since 1996, he returned for the year's opening major, the Masters at Augusta, when he tied for 17th place.
After jarring his hand in the final round at Augusta he took four weeks away from the tour before returning at the Players' Championship last month where he finished joint 69th.
