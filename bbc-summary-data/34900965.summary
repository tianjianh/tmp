[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A cycling shop owner is planning on turning a perimeter road at a former RAF base into a race track for bikes.

The three-mile track runs around the edge of the former Coltishall airbase in Norfolk, now called Scottow Enterprise Park.
Pedal Revolution is hoping to secure £300,000 in funding to turn the old RAF operations room into a headquarters with a cafe and workshop.
The circuit would be used for races as well as non-competitive riding.
Neil Turner, who runs Pedal Revolution, said it would be the "only cycle park this side of London" and they would not need to lay any new Tarmac.
"Cycling is the fastest growing sport, our most successful event at the last two Olympiads and, quite frankly, road cycling has got no facilities at all," he said.
"We've been working with Norfolk County Council and we're really excited about creating such a wonderful community asset.
"It is about competition, but it will also be a hub for recreational activity."
It would link up the base with cycle paths between Norwich, Hoveton and Aylsham.
Mr Turner said he would seek funding from bodies such as Sport England and the National Lottery.
The Pedal Park would charge a membership fee once it was ready, but would operate as a non-profit, community business.
The RAF left Coltishall at the end of 2006, Norfolk County Council bought the former airbase for £4m in 2013 and a solar farm has been built in the centre of the airfield.
Councillor Hilary Cox, the council's champion for walking and cycling, said: "It's important because it will cover all aspects of cycling - competitions, functions, training youngsters and it will link up with other cycle tracks."
Mr Turner said the aim was to have the cycle park ready by mid-2016.
