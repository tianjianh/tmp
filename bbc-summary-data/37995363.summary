Luisa Pearce from Staplehurst in Kent has been paralysed on her left side since minor surgery on her wrist went wrong.
She said it was "hugely important" for her to show disabled people they could "achieve anything".
The 100-mile, seven-day trek raised funds for her charity Freedom for Wheels, which helps people with the cost of mobility equipment.
