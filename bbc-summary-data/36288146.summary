Blaise Lewinson attacked Stefan Appleton, 18, while he was with friends in Nightingale Park in Islington on 10 June last year.
The 17-year-old, who can now be named after reporting restrictions were lifted, had been found guilty of manslaughter at the Old Bailey.
The judge said he regarded the killing as "very close to murder".
Lewinson, who was cleared of murder, must serve a minimum of nine years before he can be considered for release on licence.
The trial heard he had stabbed Mr Appleton, a college student from Islington, in the leg and chest while children played on nearby swings and slides.
Lewinson was allegedly heard shouting "RP", standing for Red Pitch - a rival to another gang in the area - as he fled on the back of a moped following the attack.
In his defence, the killer said he had come under attack when he went to snatch back his bicycle which had been stolen by another boy.
Judge Hone said Lewinson was a "dangerous offender" who had a "fascination with illegal knives" and had shown "no true remorse".
He said his "history of previous offending and non-compliance with court orders justifies... a discretionary life sentence".
The trial had heard he had a previous conviction for possessing a blade after being caught with a lock-knife in a McDonald's restaurant a year before the killing.
Judge Hone said Lewinson could now be named as he should be identified as a deterrent to others and because of the public interest.
The alleged getaway rider, 17, was cleared of murder while another boy, also 17, was previously found not guilty of conspiracy to cause grievous bodily harm.
The Metropolitan Police has issued guidance about "zombie" knives, advising that this is how certain ornate weapons are currently being marketed. The force says:
