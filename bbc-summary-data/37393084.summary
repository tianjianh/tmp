[SN]TITLE[SN]
Yeovil Town 4-2 Cheltenham Town

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Goals from Otis Khan, Darren Ward, Matt Dolan and Tom Eaves were enough to see Yeovil claim a battling victory against Cheltenham at Huish Park.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Glovers took the lead in the sixth minute. Tom Eaves' marauding run down the right saw the frontman fizz in a cross that goalkeeper Russell Griffiths could not deal with, leaving Khan to tap home.
On 16 minutes, Yeovil doubled their lead as Khan's corner found Ward unmarked to head powerfully past the helpless Griffiths.
Cheltenham halved the deficit on 41 minutes as Aaron Downes rose highest to head past Artur Krysiak.
Yeovil regained their two-goal advantage in first-half stoppage time. The impressive Khan saw his effort saved by Griffiths but Dolan was there to convert with a diving header.
Cheltenham were awarded a penalty shortly before the hour after Eaves bundled into Rob Dickie. Krysiak saved the spot-kick but substitute Billy Waters netted in the ensuing scramble.
On the 90th minute, Eaves outpaced Downes to score an excellent solo goal and secure the three points.
