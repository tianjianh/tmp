Paddy Dear, 16, was found near Dale Fort, at about 01:00 GMT on Friday, after a search by Dyfed-Powys Police.
He was visiting the Dale Fort field centre, Haverfordwest, with Campion School, in Hornchurch, Essex.
Head teacher Keith William told parents in an email his death had a "devastating effect" on the school.
In an announcement on the school's website, Mr Williams said Paddy was a "keen sportsman" and a "popular, very friendly and caring young man".
"His team members remember him as a talented, all-round sportsman, loved by all who got to know him, fantastic company and the life and soul of any party," he added.
A special memorial mass for sixth-form students was held at 11:30 at the school.
Paddy was reported missing by his teachers with his body later recovered after a joint search by police and the coastguard.
Dyfed-Powys Police said his "family had been informed" and they were being supported by officers in Hornchurch.
The force asked anyone with information to get in contact.
