The former Sunderland player is expected to sign the new contract this week, ending months of talks.
The England international joined Liverpool from the Black Cats in 2011 in a deal worth around £20m.
With Steven Gerrard leaving at the end of the season for Major League Soccer side LA Galaxy, the 24-year-old is among the favourites for the captaincy.
Vice-captain Henderson, whose current contract expires at the end of next season, has scored seven times in 55 games for club and country this campaign.
