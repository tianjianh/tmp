Jose Fonte may replace Angelo Ogbonna, who will miss the rest of the season with a knee injury, while Robert Snodgrass is also set for his debut.
Manchester City midfielder Fernandinho is available after completing a ban.
City striker Sergio Aguero is back in contention after missing the FA Cup win against Crystal Palace with a knock.
Simon Brotherton: "West Ham have already been beaten twice by Manchester City this season with an aggregate score of 8-1, but they at least go into this game with the Dimitri Payet saga over and two new signings in the squad.
"City, meanwhile, return to the London Stadium less than a month after handing out an impressive 5-0 thumping when the teams met in the FA Cup third round.
"It was the Hammers' heaviest home defeat in a competitive game in half a century.
"Most bizarre, though, of all the pre-match statistics is the fact that City goalkeeper Claudio Bravo has faced nine shots on target in 2017 and saved only one of them, conceding eight goals."

West Ham manager Slaven Bilic on the departure of Dimitri Payet: "Does he owe an apology? No. I wouldn't say that.
"He is gone, he went home, that was his wish and I will not forget how good he was for us.
"He was brilliant. I was so happy and proud, with my team, my staff, to help him achieve what he did. What he achieved with us was a great story for West Ham, for the Premier League and for France.
"I want to thank him for everything he did for us - he was brilliant last year. We were brilliant for him also. Now that story's finished, I wish him luck and all the best in Marseille."
Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola on Fernandinho's disciplinary record: "He's not an aggressive player. He's a tough, intense player, like English football is.
"He is one of the nicest guys I've ever met... what happened against Chelsea [a shove on Cesc Fabregas] we have talked about a lot.
"The other action [a two-footed tackle against Burnley] - I saw many of them here. We accept the ban, we don't complain, but he's not an aggressive guy. He's an honest guy."
West Ham are improving but I am still backing City to win.
Pep Guardiola's side took a bit of a battering when they lost to Everton on 15 January but they have put in some impressive performances since then.
