General Election 2015: Nelson at the heart of Pendle

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
If the main parties are still unclear about how this election might go then what about prospective voters?

Have they managed to read a manifesto or even one of the leaflets pushed through the letterbox?
As part of BBC Radio Lancashire's "Set Out Your Stall" tour, we've been going along to 16 markets - one in each of Lancashire's constituencies - to ask people to tell us what the biggest issues are for them.
This week we're in Nelson.
In other areas, the National Health Service and immigration have been mentioned more than any other topics.
In the case of the health service, many of our visitors expressed most concern over the way the main parties have been arguing about it, rather than the quality of care provided.
The Pendle constituency is one of the key election seats in the county, one which has attracted a great deal of attention from Labour and the Tories.
The seat was taken from Labour by the Conservatives five years ago. Andrew Stephenson won it for the Tories in 2010, defeating Labour by 3,585 votes on a 6.6% swing.
Lining up against him in the red corner this time will be Azhar Ali, a cabinet member on Lancashire County Council in charge of public health.
If he wins the seat he could become the first Asian MP in Lancashire.
The Liberal Democrats were 8,417 votes behind the Conservatives five years ago. Is there any way their candidate Graham Roach can paint this part of Lancashire yellow?
Mick Waddington is standing for UKIP while Laura Fisk represents the Green Party.
Some of the county's biggest political hitters will gather at the Ace centre in Nelson on Friday for our latest election debate.
Joining Mr Ali and Ms Fisk will be Rob Loughenbury, who is standing for the Conservatives in Chorley; the Liberal Democrats' Gordon Birtwhistle - who will be hoping to retain Burnley for his party - and UKIP's Matthew Atkins, who will be contesting Lancaster and Fleetwood.
As well as the NHS and immigration, the panel will also be asked about welfare and benefits, housing and education.
