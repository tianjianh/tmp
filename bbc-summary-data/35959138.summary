A Jacobite force led by Bonnie Prince Charlie was defeated on the moorland battlefield near Inverness by a government army on 16 April 1746.
The National Trust for Scotland, which manages a large part of the battlefield, and Inverness Museum and Art Gallery are marking the clash.
The forthcoming events include exhibitions, a procession and talks.
An exhibition of art work by Scottish artist Calum Colvin and inspired by paintings and sculptures depicting the Jacobites, Culloden and Bonnie Prince Charlie will be held at Inverness Museum and Art Gallery.
Jacobites By Name will run from 5 April to 7 May. The artist will also give a lecture at the museum on 19 April.
The National Trust for Scotland, working with the Gaelic Society of Inverness, will hold events over two-days, including on the anniversary of the battle.
There will be a talk called Archaeology of the Jacobite Uprisings: evidence from National Trust for Scotland properties at the battlefield visitor centre on 15 April.
On 16 April, there will be a procession to the Culloden Cairn followed by a series of talks and presentations at the centre.
