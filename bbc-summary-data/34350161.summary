[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A locum doctor at a Norfolk hospital has been found guilty of sexually assaulting a male patient he was treating on a busy ward.

Dr Manav Arora, 37, from Birmingham, denied the attack at a trial at Norwich Crown Court.
He was working at Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital when the incident happened in September last year.
The victim, not named for legal reasons, said the doctor performed oral sex on him while inserting a catheter.
The attack is said to have taken place behind a curtain while five other patients lay nearby.
Married father-of-one Arora had insisted any contact with the victim's penis was medically necessary.
Judge Guy Ayers adjourned sentencing to a later date, telling Arora: "You have been convicted on the plainest possible evidence.
"The question for me is how long a custodial sentence will be."
The court heard from two men who claimed they were also assaulted by Arora at the University Hospital of North Tees in Stockton-on-Tees, four years earlier.
Prosecutor Andrew Shaw said Arora had also been suspended in 2005 after a similar accusation was made at a hospital in Portsmouth.
Indian-born Arora also received a caution from West Midlands Police after being caught engaged in a sex act with another man in Sandwell Valley Park near West Bromwich less than two weeks after the incident in Norwich.
Outside court, Det Con Graham Kett, of Norfolk Constabulary, said it was possible Arora had assaulted other people who never reported their concerns.
"The victim went into hospital to get treatment and found himself getting sexually assaulted by this doctor. It was a terrible ordeal for him.
"I am pleased we have got justice for this man, the others before him and others still who we may not even know about."
