Mid and West Wales Fire and Rescue Service were called to Charles Street, Milford Haven at 00:38 GMT on Sunday.
No one was hurt after the occupants were alerted by a smoke alarm to the fire in their front room.
Steve Davies, deputy head of community safety, said the incident could have been much worse.
He said: "We all love Christmas lights, but we often forget that Christmas lights are used far less than everyday lights, and so require more care.
"When arranging your lights, please follow the manufacturer's instructions, check that your Christmas lights carry the British Standard sign and replace any bulbs that blow.
"These light bulbs can burn through materials such as paper of fabrics so please do not attach decorations to lights or heaters."
"Make this a Christmas to remember for the right reasons, always ensure that you switch all Christmas lights off and unplug them before leaving the house or going to bed."
