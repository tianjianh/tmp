The First Minister has called for a constitutional convention to be set up in order to keep the UK together.

Carwyn Jones said he was concerned that the future of the UK was being driven by Scotland where the SNP is talking about a referendum on independence.
Mr Jones said it was time for a more pro-active approach from those who wanted to see the union maintained.
His comments followed new research which showed more English voters think devolution has worsened UK government.
"It isn't simply a matter of more devolution or less devolution - there should be an open debate about how the UK itself might function more responsively to the needs of its constituent parts," said Mr Jones, speaking at the first in a series of regular monthly press conferences.
"I'm open to discussion about what form a convention should take but the key point is that it should include a variety of opinion formers and members of the public to ensure that politicians can focus on the really important issues like jobs and growth."
On Monday a report was published on changing attitudes in England which showed a sharp rise in those who think the Welsh assembly has had a negative impact.
Meanwhile, in contrast to UK Labour leader Ed Miliband, Mr Jones said he could see "no reason" for a pay cap on public sector wages, which he said would cause difficulties in Wales.
"I think it's absolutely crucial that people see that those who are paid the most in financial services, those who the public believe were responsible for our current economic difficulties, pay their fair share as well.
"I don't believe that this is being done and as a result I think it's very difficult to say to those who work in the public sector, who didn't cause the economic difficulties, that we have to bear the brunt of pay cuts when it isn't happening in those sectors which are more appropriate."
