[SN]TITLE[SN]
Europa League: AZ Alkmaar 1-1 Dundalk

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Dundalk made history as a late equaliser saw them hold AZ Alkmaar in the Europa League to become the first Irish team to pick up a European point.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Stijn Wuytens bravely headed AZ into the lead on the hour but needed lengthy treatment after being concussed.
Dundalk's hopes looked slim when captain Stephen O'Donnell was sent off for a second yellow card.
But Ciaran Kilduff, who broke his back in April, headed home late on and they survived nine minutes of injury time.
The 27-year-old substitute, who sustained fractured vertebrae in a domestic cup match, had to spend 10 days wearing a neck brace.
Stephen Kenny's Dundalk have won the League of Ireland - which runs from March to November - for the past two seasons, and are 10 points clear at the top this season.
But their run in Europe has brought wider attention to his side.
Dundalk beat Icelandic side FH in the Champions League qualifiers, before stunning BATE Borisov 3-0 to win 3-1 on aggregate. They lost in the play-off to Legia Warsaw, instead dropping into the Europa League group stages.
They wanted to go one better than Shamrock Rovers, the only Irish team to reach the group stages, who lost all their six games in 2011.
And after one night - one magical night - in Alkmaar, they have already done that.
When skipper O'Donnell, who had only just returned from a European ban, was dismissed on 72 minutes for bringing down Ridgeciano Haps, Dundalk seemed to have little chance of taking anything from the game.
But, after surviving several scares, Kilduff got on the end of a Daryl Horgan free-kick to head the crucial goal.
Dundalk will play their home matches at Tallaght Stadium in Dublin, the home of Shamrock Rovers. Maccabi Tel Aviv, who lost 4-3 to Zenit St Petersburg in the group's other opener, are the visitors for the next round of matches on 29 September.
There was immediate concern for Wuytens after his goal, the 26-year-old midfielder colliding with Dundalk keeper Gary Rogers, having courageously got on the end of a long ball to head the opener.
Wuytens received lengthy medical attention before being carried off wearing a neck brace.
However, the Eredivisie club soon announced that the Belgian had regained consciousness.
