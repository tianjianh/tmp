His career at the corporation spanned two decades and he was a driving force behind the launch of Reporting Scotland in 1968.
He left the BBC in 1987, later setting up an independent production company.
Broadcaster Kirsty Wark, who was given her first presenter job by Mr Sinclair, described him as a "first class journalist".
She said: "The things I remember most about him are that he was thorough, fair with a dry sense of humour and most of all he was a consummate journalist."
Mr Sinclair began his journalistic career in newspapers, working in Fleet Street, and later becoming the youngest news editor of the Daily Mail in Scotland at the age of 27.
Longstanding BBC correspondent Colin Blane recalled: "He brought with him a fierce sense of competition. He wanted BBC Scotland's television news to be the sharpest and to be the best - and he drove the newsroom very hard."
After leaving the BBC, George Sinclair worked briefly for Radio Clyde and then set up an independent production company, producing a weekly programme looking at the Scottish newspaper industry for STV.
BBC Scotland director Ken MacQuarrie said: "Many present day broadcast journalists owe their careers to George Sinclair who led the BBC newsroom for many years with great flair and dedication.
"He was an old style journalist who led by example and many young journalists honed their skills under his guidance. Our thoughts are with his family."
Former BBC colleague and later STV head of programmes David Scott said Mr Sinclair had been "a good influence on many aspiring reporters".
"There was not a single journalist who worked for George who wasn't a better journalist after they'd worked for George," he said.
