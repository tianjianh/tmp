According to the Daily Mail, a group of five-year-old children shot water at the postman as he made deliveries in Trebanog.
CCTV footage appears to show the postman taking the toy off a child and throwing it in his van.
The Royal Mail said his actions were "not acceptable behaviour".
Spokeswoman Sally Hopkins said: "We have apologised to the customer and will be sending her a cheque so she can buy her son a new toy.
"We are now dealing with this internally and this postman will not be delivering to this address until further notice."
