Hawick flood scheme progress monitored

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The public is being given a chance to check progress on a £36.4m flood protection scheme for Hawick.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A first tranche of Scottish government funding of more than £1m has already been received towards the project.
Hundreds of people attended a two-day exhibition in August last year to find out more about the proposals.
Two further drop-in events will be held later this month to deliver an update on how public input has affected the project's design.
A survey carried out at the exhibition in 2016 found 85.5% of people attending supported the scheme.
The latest information days will be staged at the Heart of Hawick centre between 17:30 and 20:30 on 18 and 19 January.
