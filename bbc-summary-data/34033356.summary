County Championship: Surrey frustrated by Bristol rain

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Surrey's hopes of boosting their promotion hopes with victory over Gloucestershire were dented by rain, with no play possible on day three.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The visitors were set to resume their first innings on 349-6, a lead of 116, with Ben Foakes on 140 not out.
But the weather in Bristol kept the players off the field throughout the morning session at Nevil Road.
And umpires Russell Evans and Graham Lloyd decided at 14:45 BST that there was no realistic prospect of play.
With only one day's play remaining, a draw is now the most likely result, barring a Gloucestershire collapse in their second innings.
Surrey began the game in second place in Division Two, 54 points clear of Glamorgan, with Gloucestershire fourth, a further nine points adrift.
