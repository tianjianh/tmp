Iris Perkins claims she was attacked by the Staffordshire Bull terrier in the Trowbridge Green area of the city.
She suffered injuries to both her legs and needed specialist skin graft treatment at Swansea's Morriston Hospital.
South Wales Police have seized the dog as part of their investigation.
Mrs Perkins' family said she escaped after she managed to pull the dog off.
Her daughter Sue Martin said: "She hit him hard enough to startle him and that's when she escaped.
"It must have taken such strength. She's a tiny woman and the thought of her getting hurt when she's doing so well for her age breaks my heart."
"She's not the bright and independent mum she was before the attack," she added.
Mrs Perkins was taken to the University Hospital of Wales in Cardiff but was transferred to Morriston Hospital for specialist treatment.
Because of her age, doctors were reluctant to give her a general anaesthetic so she underwent a skin graft under an epidural.
South Wales Police said they were investigating and forensic tests were being carried out on the 18-month-old dog.
