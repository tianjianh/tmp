The visitors took the lead with only their third away goal of the season, courtesy of Tom Lawrence's solo effort.
But the Owls drew level when goalkeeper Bartosz Bia≈Çkowski spilled a shot and striker Gary Hooper pounced.
Neither side threatened in a drab second half before Chambers nodded in the winner from a corner on 86 minutes.
Ipswich had failed to score in eight of their last 12 away league games and won only once in eight.
And manager McCarthy had come under fire from some of their supporters in their 2-2 draw with Rotherham last weekend.
But Town fans had something to cheer when Lawrence dispossessed Jack Hunt and fired a low shot into the bottom corner to give them the lead.
Their joy was short-lived, however, as Hooper was the first to react when Bialkowski failed to hold on to David Jones' shot.
Wednesday went into the game having won 11 of their 18 home league games in 2016, but created few other clear-cut chances and were punished late on by Town skipper Chambers.
Sheffield Wednesday manager Carlos Carvalhal: "I must accept that we didn't perform at our level and I hope that will be an exception.
"We were lacking energy and hit a wall. We must be more dynamic and have a different attitude.
"They were very compact and, to open up this kind of team, we need to move the ball very well and create spaces.
"We didn't pose a real threat to the opponents, but we didn't deserve to lose the game. We didn't deserve to win, either."
Ipswich manager Mick McCarthy: "I'm very, very pleased, of course, with the performance and happier with the result. I thought we were excellent.
"As the game went on, we caught them on the break a number of times and didn't really make enough of it until we got the winner.
"I had no worry about my ability or my confidence in the players and they've backed that up today with a really good performance.
"That performance and result today reflects my time at Ipswich. That is more like my team and how I have been."
