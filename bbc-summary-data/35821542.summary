A woman accused of causing her partner's death in a car crash could have been driving too fast for the road conditions with a defective tyre, a trial has heard.

Vicki Williamson, 36, of Dundee, was driving on the A956 Charleston flyover, south of Aberdeen, when the crash happened in August 2014.
Liam Thornton, 26, later died in hospital.
Ms Williamson denies causing death by careless driving.
Giving evidence at Aberdeen Sheriff Court, police sergeant Graham Mutch said the accident happened at the top of a sweeping bend on a slip road off the A90 Aberdeen to Dundee road.
The collision investigator said the road was wet at the time.
Examinations of the Vauxhall Corsa revealed that the tread on the inner edge of the rear near side tyre was under the 1.6mm legal limit.
Collision investigators concluded that the most likely cause of the collision was that the car was driven at an inappropriate speed on the corner for the conditions.
Earlier, Vicki Williamson gave evidence and blamed the road surface for the collision.
She said: "It wasn't the best road conditions. I kind of took my time coming up the road. It had been really stormy the night before in Dundee to the point there was trees on the roads.
"So I was aware that the road would be damp, wet."
She said she was aware of a sharp corner on the slip road coming off the A90 and estimated her speed to be about 30mph when she approached the bend because she was in third gear.
Defence lawyer Alan Finlay asked: "Are you aware of losing control of the vehicle?"
She replied: "Yes. To me it was something to do with the road surface. There was nothing I could do.
"I tried to get the car back under control."
Williamson wept as she recalled the moments after the collision.
She said: "The next thing I remember was just being at the side of the road with the fire brigade and they were pulling up a big curtain and Liam was at the side of it and they were trying to revive him."
The trial continues.
