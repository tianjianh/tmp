[SN]TITLE[SN]
Four staff investigated at Bryn Hesketh unit, Colwyn Bay

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Four staff at a mental health unit in Colwyn Bay are being investigated over concerns about their conduct.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
It comes after six staff members were suspended from Bryn Hesketh in October after an allegation about patient care on the ward.
That allegation, made by another member of staff, was not upheld.
Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board said a further investigation into four staff members was taking place.
The health board said the new investigation did not concern patient care.
"Some staff will continue to be absent from the ward whilst this investigation takes place," a spokesman said.
The health board did not confirm whether any of the staff in the latest investigation were the same as those previously investigated.
