England's Lee Slattery is tied for the lead with five holes held over until Monday at a weather-affected Shenzhen International at Genzon Golf Club.

Twenty-three players will return early on Monday to complete their rounds after play was suspended on Sunday because of bad light.
Slattery and South Korea's Soomin Lee are 14-under after 13 completed holes.
Co-leader Alexander Levy of France faces a birdie putt on the 13th green when play resumes.
More than six and a half hours were lost to bad weather over the first two days, and more time was lost in the final round on Sunday because of an afternoon thunderstorm.
Australian Scott Hend is the clubhouse leader at 13-under after a bogey-free 66, with South African Brandon Stone and Dutchman Joost Luiten also 13-under with five and three holes to complete respectively.
