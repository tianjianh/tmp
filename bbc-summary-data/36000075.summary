Loch Garten's 'soap opera' osprey lays first egg

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A female osprey whose previous breeding seasons have been described as being akin to a soap opera has laid her first egg of the 2016 season.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The migratory bird of prey has returned to RSPB Scotland's Loch Garten reserve, near Grantown on Spey, for its 14th season.
Nicknamed EJ, her previous drama-filled visits have included having her eggs kicked out of the nest by rival males.
Reserve staff have compared her seasons to a TV soap.
