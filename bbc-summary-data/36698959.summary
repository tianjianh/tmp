Jaidee finished day three two clear of McIlroy and carded a final round of 68 to finish on 11 under.
McIlroy could only card a level-par 71 in his last round.
"The way I've felt out there and to finish third on my own, it's been a decent week in that regard," he told Sky Sports.
"I've got 10 days until the Open starts. I'm going to be working every day to try and get better and will play a bit of links golf to work on the shots I need for Troon as well."

This will be McIlroy's first Open since winning the Claret Jug in 2014 after a foot injury ruled him out of defending his title at St Andrews last year.
Jaidee, 46, claimed his fourth win since turning 40 and never looked troubled on the final day despite Italy's Francesco Molinari shooting a 66 to finish second.
England's Andy Sullivan looked set to finish in the top three before a bogey on 17 and a triple-bogey seven on the last left him tied for fifth
