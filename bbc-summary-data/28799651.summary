[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A labradoodle called Pepper who fell over cliffs in East Sussex resisted rescue attempts by Coastguard teams for more than 26 hours.

The dog slipped over the edge while she was off the lead at Ecclesbourne Glen, near Hastings on Wednesday afternoon.
Rescue teams from Hastings and Rye Bay finally managed to persuade her to come close enough to be rescued at 17:30 BST on Thursday.
Pepper was hoisted to the cliff top unhurt but thirsty and exhausted.
The Maritime and Coastguard Agency said the maritime rescue co-ordination centre at Dover (MRCC) was alerted by Sussex Police when the dog fell off the cliff.
MRCC teams located her on a narrow ridge and spent four hours trying to persuade her to come to them but she refused.
They then approached from the other end of the ridge and tried to tempt her with dog treats and meat, but had to call off the rescue attempt in darkness at 23:00 BST.
It resumed on Thursday morning and it took all day before Pepper would move to a position where she could be rescued.
Her owner, from London, said: "I never thought that she would run through the gorse and no idea that there was a sheer cliff on the other side of it.
"I will never again walk Pepper off the lead near a cliff and would strongly advise other dog owners to learn from our experience."
