Ipswich Town manager Mick McCarthy says he is "fuming" with his side after their 1-0 loss at home to League Two side Stevenage in the EFL Cup.

Despite fielding a strong side, the Championship club went out in the first round for the third time in four years.
"I have no complaints about the result, I have hundreds of complaints about the performance," he told BBC Suffolk.
"We didn't get about them. They were faster to the ball, better in the air and better in the tackle."
McCarthy was particularly unhappy with how his side failed to increase the pressure as the game went on.
"Why we should be as flat as that, I don't know?" said McCarthy said.
"We had nobody on the pitch that really grabbed it and said 'lets get the tempo going' and that for me is really disappointing.
"We're out of it and I'm bitterly disappointed, I'm fuming at the minute."
