League of Ireland Premier Division result: Bray Wanderers 2-2 Derry City

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Derry City extended their unbeaten League of Ireland run to seven games as they drew 2-2 with in-form Bray Wanderers at the Carlisle Grounds.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Dylan Connolly put Bray ahead on 17 minutes but Rory Patterson levelled on 32 with his 11th goal of the season.
Aaron McEneff edged Derry ahead from the penalty spot on 55 minutes but Connolly secured a point for Bray with a 70th-minute equaliser.
Derry remain third in the table, five points behind leaders Dundalk.
A win would have edged the Candystripes ahead of second-placed Cork although both the Leesiders and Dundalk have three games in hand on Derry.
Dundalk, after beating Wexford Youths 1-0 on Friday night, are four points clear at the top.
Jason Marks' clever pass set up Connolly to strike Bray ahead but Derry were on terms within 15 minutes as Patterson tapped home after McEneff's free-kick had come back off the woodwork.
McEneff slotted his penalty after Ronan Curtis had been brought down by Gareth McDonagh but Connolly broke clear of the Derry defence to level 20 minutes from time.
Derry have another away contest against fourth-placed Shamrock Rovers on Tuesday before a home game against Galway United next Friday.
Bray went into the game after successive wins over Dundalk and Galway United and Saturday's draw extends their unbeaten run to nine games.
