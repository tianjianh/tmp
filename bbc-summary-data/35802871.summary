Batman, Flash Gordon and a 1930s-built Japanese robot are expected to draw classic toy collectors to a sale.

They are among a collection of almost 1,000 robots amassed over 40 years by a couple from the North East.
The Out of This World auction takes place at toy sale specialist Vectis in Thornaby, Teesside and is expected to raise more than Â£40,000.
Auctioneer Andy Reed said it was the largest single collection of robots the auction house had sold.
