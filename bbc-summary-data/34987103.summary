Nathan Ferguson: Burton Albion sign Grays Athletic midfielder

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Midfielder Nathan Ferguson has joined League One leaders Burton Albion on a two-and-a-half-year deal from non-league side Grays Athletic.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Ferguson, who had a proposed deal with Fleetwood fall through recently, joins Burton after a successful trial period.
The 20-year-old was a youth player at Dagenham & Redbridge, but is yet to make a Football League appearance.
Grays are currently 10th in the Isthmian League Premier Division, of the seventh tier of English football.
Ferguson could be Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink's final signing, with the Burton boss in talks with QPR.
