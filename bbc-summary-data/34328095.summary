[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 15-day Wiltshire Police amnesty, which ended on Sunday, included more than 30 shotguns being handed in.
Insp Steve McGrath, said: "Many of the firearms are old and cobweb-covered, which have been in people's possession for some time."
The rare models are being offered to military museums for display but the rest will be destroyed, police said.
Items collected include 27 air rifles, 35 shotguns, nine air pistols, three revolvers and three handguns.
Insp McGrath added: "Many of these firearms have stories to tell, such as a .303 rifle from the 1870s.
"This was an 'unreliable' rifle type for military use, but was converted to .22 calibre and used for sporting purposes in shooting clubs across the country.
"We also collected two rare European pistols from the 1900s."
Unused ammunition was also handed in.
