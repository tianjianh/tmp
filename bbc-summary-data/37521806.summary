Almost £25m has been raised to pay for "vital" restoration work at Canterbury Cathedral.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Heritage Lottery Fund has awarded a £13.8m grant to the cathedral, which has raised a further £10.9m.
It sold pieces of stone removed during restoration of the 15th Century Great South Window, some of which sold for more than £7,000 each.
The roof of the nave is set to be replaced and a new visitor centre is to be built.
The Grade I listed cathedral, founded in AD 597, has been a world-famous centre of pilgrimage.
One million people visit the cathedral every year, the Very Reverend Dr Robert Willis, said.
"This is without doubt a very exciting time for the cathedral," he said.
"We want to further enhance the experience for [visitors] as well as reach out to those communities with whom we would like to to share the richness of the heritage we have in this magnificent place."
The Gothic-style window, which is 52ft (16m) high and 23ft (7m) wide, was removed in December 2013 after stone fell onto a pathway.
Much of it had to be rebuilt after crumbling stonework revealed serious structural problems.
Parts of the window were put on display at the Getty Museum in in Los Angeles.
