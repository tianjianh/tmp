[SN]TITLE[SN]
Man arrested in Norfolk plotted to kill Bedfordshire businessman

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A convicted fraudster has been jailed for seven years for plotting to murder a former criminal partner who became a legitimate businessman after prison.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Paul Vass had been jailed with the Bedfordshire businessman in 2002 over a Â£14m VAT fraud in Suffolk.
Vass, 49, found himself doing low paid work and believed his former partner had pocketed the proceeds of the scam.
He was found guilty of soliciting murder and possessing a firearm at Inner London Crown Court.
Vass, also known as Paul Matthews and Paul Fox, went to Bedfordshire to demand his share of the scam, which he put at Â£2.25m.
The businessman refused to pay and police became aware of the plot.
They tracked Vass to a Norfolk hotel where he was living and he was arrested.
Detectives found in his room a contract which he was going to make the businessman sign, handing over his businesses and cars.
Weapons including a gun and a knife were also found.
Vass was charged with two counts of soliciting murder, making a threat to kill, possessing a firearm with intent to endanger life, having a firearm in a public place and having an offensive weapon.
He denied the charges but was convicted of all charges on Friday following a trial.
He was also banned from contacting the intended victim and key witnesses or possessing, or seeking to possess offensive weapons.
He must also pay a Â£120 victim surcharge.
