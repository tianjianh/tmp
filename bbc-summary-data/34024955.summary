The Spireites started brightly and went in front on 17 minutes when O'Shea struck a volley from the edge of the area, which went in off the post.
Tommy Lee denied Millwall an equaliser with a stunning one-handed save to keep out Jimmy Abdou's deflected shot.
O'Shea had the final say in injury time when his deflected shot beat Lions goalkeeper Jordan Archer.
Millwall are now four games without a win in League One and sit two points above the relegation zone.

Millwall manager Neil Harris told BBC London 94.9:
"I'm extremely disappointed and frustrated. In the first half we started well and then we didn't get a foothold for 20 minutes - their midfield was on top of ours.
"In the second half we came out and we looked a lot brighter, we looked much better in possession, we dominated the game for the next 40 minutes but couldn't find the end product.
"We chased the game and concede by deflection in the end. It's frustrating."
