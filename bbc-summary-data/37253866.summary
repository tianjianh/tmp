Trevor Timon, 31, of Plumstead, appeared at Bromley Magistrates' Court via video-link to face a charge of murder and common assault.
Oliver Dearlove, from Eltham, died in hospital after being hit while waiting for a taxi in Blackheath.
He was in Tranquil Vale with friends when he was attacked on Sunday.
The court heard the defendant has indicated a plea of not guilty on the basis that there was no intention to kill or cause serious harm or injury.
Mr Timon was remanded in custody for a bail hearing at the Old Bailey on Tuesday.
A post-mortem gave the provisional cause of Mr Dearlove's death as a head injury. He worked for Duncan Lawrie Private Bank.
