A fly-past from the Battle of Britain Memorial Flight (BBMF) has taken place over the Isle of Man to honour those who died in the conflict.

The battle started in July 1940 and by its end 544 RAF Fighter Command pilots and 2,500 Luftwaffe aircrew had died.
A Hurricane, Spitfire and a Lancaster bomber flew over Jurby earlier as part of the Festival of Jurby.
The Lancaster is one of only two left flying in the world - the other is in Canada.
Organisers said it was one of the "most evocative and emotional aviation sights" in remembrance of "the few who defended our skies during the Summer of 1940".
The fly-past was organised to coincide with this year's Vintage Motor Cycle Club Festival of Jurby.
Festival organisers said it commemorated all those who had lost their lives serving in the RAF, or its predecessor the Royal Flying Corps.
The BBMF is a regular RAF unit, manned by service personnel and funded by the Ministry of Defence.
A total of 2,585 aircrew died during the four-month battle and 1,977 aircraft were destroyed.
