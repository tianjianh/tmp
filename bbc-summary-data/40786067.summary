AFC Fylde maintained their unbeaten start since promotion to the National League with a second successive draw at Chester.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Following Saturday's 2-2 draw against Boreham Wood, the Coasters again took the lead and had enough chances to win.
After a drab opening 40 minutes, the game came to life when Chester new boy Harry White was denied by visiting keeper Rhys Taylor's legs at one end before Jonny Smith's angled right-foot shot crept just wide at the other.
Fylde then took the lead when Jack Muldoon netted from close range but Chester quickly levelled in first-half added time when Kingsley James set up Lucas Dawson to coolly guide home with his right instep from 12 yards.
Fylde could have won it but for a great late save from Chester's debutant keeper Conor Mitchell to deny Sam Finley's right-foot shot.
But, on his return to Chester after a year at Barrow, sub Ross Hannah then fired wide from a tight angle after rounding keeper Taylor.
Chester were making their first appearance of the season following Saturday's controversial abandonment at Solihull.
