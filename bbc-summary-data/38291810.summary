BT said the new roles would be based at its contact centres in Swansea, Warrington, Doncaster and Accrington.
In January the conglomerate announced 1,000 new posts promising more of its consumer customer calls to be dealt with in the UK and Ireland.
A spokesman said the recruitment process for the 500 extra jobs would start this month.
Libby Barr, managing director of customer care at BT Consumer, said: "BT is completely changing the way we serve our customers in order to boost our service levels.
"We are going to answer 90% of our customers' calls in the UK and Ireland by the end of March, and we have been taking on great people to fill full time jobs working for BT."
