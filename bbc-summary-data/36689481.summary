The 31-year-old, who won gold aboard Valegro, emulates the achievement of cyclist Laura Trott, 24.
Germany took silver and bronze through Isabell Werth and Kristina Broring-Sprehe respectively.
"I feel a little bit overwhelmed," said a tearful Dujardin, who also won team dressage gold four years ago.
Enfield-born Dujardin won GB's 40th medal of the Rio Games, and 16th gold, with a 93.857% routine.
Compatriot Carl Hester, 49, was seventh out of 18 while Fiona Bigwood, 40, was 17th. Ireland's Judy Reynolds was 18th.
"It means the absolute world to me to come out here and finish off being individual gold medallist again," added Dujardin, the first British woman to retain an individual Olympic title.
"I felt a huge amount of pressure and expectation.
"It could be one of last rides on Valegro. There is talk of retirement for him so for me to finish it in this way, it's a really emotional time and I'm so happy."
At London 2012, Dujardin, Hester and Laura Bechtolsheimer took team dressage gold ahead of Germany inside Greenwich Park.
On Friday, Dujardin won a silver medal in that event, along with Hester, Bigwood and Spencer Wilton, when they were beaten by world champions Germany.
Olympic silver medallist and BBC equestrian pundit Ian Stark: "One wonders will Valegro go on? I hope he does because we just love watching him.
"What a partnership they have been. He looked fantastic, he didn't look 14 - he looked more like a 12-year-old. He was in flying form.
"It's always that worry - do we keep going? Do we keep asking? Or do we let him retire on a high."
