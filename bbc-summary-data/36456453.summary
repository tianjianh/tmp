Ex-Barcelona boss Guardiola has left Bayern Munich to replace Manuel Pellegrini as City manager this summer.
"I'm absolutely excited about Pep joining our team," said Al Mubarak. "I consider Pep to be one of, if not the best manager, in football today.
"We are getting a manager that epitomises passion and commitment. He is a proven winner."
Guardiola was victorious in the Champions League twice at Barcelona, including their treble-winning campaign in 2008-09.
He also won the German league title with Bayern for three successive seasons, although he failed to win the Champions League with the Bundesliga outfit.
Speaking to City's website, Al Mubarak added: "I have no doubt that he will transform our team to a new level."
City finished fourth in the Premier League in 2015-16 as they failed to reclaim the title they won under Pellegrini in 2014.
However, they won the League Cup and reached the Champions League semi-finals, losing to eventual winners Real Madrid.
Al Mubarak praised the efforts of Pellegrini but admitted this season had been a disappointment, adding: "We had high expectations."
