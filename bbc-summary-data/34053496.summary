A spokesman for the player confirmed the 25-year-old was arrested on Sunday night and has since been bailed.
The spokesman said Mr Sakho denied any allegations against him, he had given police a complete explanation and had not been charged with any crime.
The Senegal international joined West Ham from Metz in France last August.
A Metropolitan Police spokesman said: "On Sunday 23 August, officers from Havering arrested a man on suspicion of threats to kill and witness intimidation.
"A 25-year-old man was arrested at an address in Emerson Park, Hornchurch. He was taken to an east London police station and bailed pending police enquiries to a date in early October."
His spokesman told the BBC: "Diafra Sakho has not been charged with any offence. He vigorously denies the allegations that have been made against him, and has given police a complete explanation of events.
"He will not be making any further comment."
Mr Sakho was also arrested on suspicion of assault in early August, three days before helping West Ham beat Arsenal 0-2 at the Emirates Stadium on 9 July.
To date he has scored 10 goals for the London side in 26 Barclays Premier League appearances.
