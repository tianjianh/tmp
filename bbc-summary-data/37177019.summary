The pair will fight for the vacant Commonwealth light-welterweight belt.
East Lothian boxer Taylor, 25, turned professional last year and has won all six of his bouts so far by knockout.
"There's only one winner and it's going to be me. I can see flaws in his game that I believe I can pinpoint," said former Olympian Taylor, who is managed by Barry McGuigan.
"This is a massive step up in class. He is really tough. He's been Commonwealth champion before.
"For it being only my seventh professional fight, to be fighting for a Commonwealth title is something I'm really proud of and I'm going to take it with both hands and make sure the belt comes back to Edinburgh.
Ryan, 33, has won 17 and lost nine of his 26 pro bouts.
The Commonwealth Games gold and silver medallist has fought on the undercard of Carl Frampton in the United States, describing the fights as "really exciting", and hopes to one day fight for a world title in the Scottish capital.
"That's the dream - Edinburgh Castle or Murrayfield," he said. "Somewhere as big as that would be massive."
He won Commonwealth Games gold in Glasgow in 2014 and silver four years earlier in Delhi.
Former WBA featherweight champion McGuigan agrees Taylor is facing a more formidable opponent than his previous six bouts.
"He [Ryan] is very experienced, strong guy, big for the weight.," said the Northern Irishman.
"We're absolutely convinced that Josh will not only beat him but beat him in resounding style.
"We're putting him in with the right guy. Have no doubt, Josh Taylor will win and win in emphatic style.
"I believe he's the finest young [Scottish] talent that we've had since [former undisputed world lightweight champion] Ken Buchanan.
"I know this kid is very, very special. This kid is going to right to the top."
However, Ryan is confident he can reclaim the title he lost to John Wayne Hibbert last year.
"It's going to be a cracking fight, really looking forward to it," said the Englishman. "It's been a while since I've been in the ring but there's going to be no ring rust.
"I really do hope he is going to be ready because I'm coming to fight and I want to make it a really good fight.
"Come October, I'll be bringing back home the belt that I won before."
