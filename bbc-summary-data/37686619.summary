Relive Tuesday's EFL Cup action
Leeds are showing signs of momentum under Garry Monk, having lost just two of their previous eight matches going into the Elland Road tie.
But they are still seven points adrift of fourth-placed Norwich, who were aiming to bounce back from Saturday's home defeat by Preston.
Both teams made sweeping changes for a fourth-round tie that developed into a entertaining encounter for the 22,222 crowd.
Italian goalkeeper Silvestri, one of the players recalled by Leeds boss Monk, made a string of superb saves and his team-mates responded by twice battling back.
Leeds took the tie to a shootout after having to play the whole of extra time with 10 men, following an injury to full-back Lewie Coyle after Monk had used all three substitutes.
However, Silvestri saved efforts from Alex Pritchard, Steven Naismith and Robbie Brady, allowing Vieira to calmly stroke Leeds into the last eight.
