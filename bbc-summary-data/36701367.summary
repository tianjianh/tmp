They were caught on camera by Karen O'Dell, a local photographer, who spotted them on Porthmeor Beach on Saturday while she sat in the rain.
She said: "The dolphins were amazing, they were really playing and jumping in the big waves.
"It was like they'd come to see us and put on a show. I have seen them before at Porthmeor but not that close."
