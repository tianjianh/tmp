[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
About 305,000 diazepam tablets were recovered in two linked police operations on Tuesday and Wednesday.
The first took place in Reid Street, Coatbridge, and was followed by a second raid in Avalon Place, Airdrie.
Police Scotland appealed for anyone with information to come forward and said a report would be sent to the procurator fiscal.
Det Insp Kevin Jamieson, from Lanarkshire Division CID, said: "We will continue to act on any information received to ensure that drug dealing has no home in our communities.
"This is a significant recovery of diazepam which has reduced the potential harm which could have been caused by these drugs, both in Lanarkshire and beyond."
