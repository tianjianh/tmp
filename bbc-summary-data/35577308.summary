The FTSE 100 rose 116.68 points to 5,824.28, after a 3% gain on Friday.
Household products maker Reckitt Benckiser was one of the top risers, up 6.8%, after posting better-than-expected annual results.
That increase gave the firm's share price its biggest one-day rise since October 2013.
Bernstein analyst Andrew Wood said: "These were a phenomenal set of results. RB blew away consensus on every major metric."
British Airways owner IAG was another top riser, adding 5.2% to 504.5p.
Mining companies led the fallers, with Fresnillo shedding 2.6% and Randgold Resources slipping 2%.
Shane Oliver, head of investment strategy at AMP Capital Investors in Sydney, said: "Shares have become oversold again and due for at least a bounce which may now be getting under way. But with global growth worries remaining, it's still premature to say that shares have bottomed."
The FTSE was still 7% lower than it was at the start of the year and about a fifth below last April's record high despite a rebound over the last two sessions.
Share markets in Frankfurt and Paris also enjoyed strong rises on Monday, adding 2.7% and 3% respectively.
After double-digit rises on Friday, Brent crude rose a further 0.8% to $33.64, while US light crude was up 1.3% to $29.81.
On the currency markets, the pound was up 0.55% against the euro at â‚¬1.2953, but 0.43% lower against the dollar at $1.4442.
