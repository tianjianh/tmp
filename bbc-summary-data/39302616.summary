A 51-year-old man has died after a fire broke out in a house in the Western Isles.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Scottish Fire and Rescue Service said the alarm was raised to the fire at St Barr's Crescent on Barra about 06:15.
Police Scotland said the man has still to be formally indentified, but his next of kin have been informed.
Insp Roddy Mackay said police and the fire service will carry out a joint investigation.
He said inquiries into the cause of the fire were still at an early stage.
The incident is the third fatal fire on the Western Isles this year.
A woman died in a house fire in the Garrynamonie area of South Uist on 10 February.
Fives days later William Hanks, 83, died after a fire broke out at his home at Kildonan, also on South Uist.
