Mr Whiter, an estate agent in Stansted, Essex, who was due to begin training with Newmarket Town FC, had his legs amputated below the knee at Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Mr Abbs, who played football with Soham Town Rangers, was trapped between his and Mr Whiter's vehicles.
Messi's shirt fetched £2,100 while Bale's brought in £1,600.
Mr Whiter thanked the professional footballers for their help and said he hoped the auction would "create awareness of disability in the area".
Mr Abbs said: "It has been tough, especially at the start but we have just been blown away by the support that we have had."
A separate crowdsourcing appeal to raise £120,000 for Mr Whiter's current and future medical needs has already reached more than £100,000.
Jan Adamec, 40, of Shetland Road in Haverhill, was jailed for more than three years last month after admitting two counts of causing serious injury by dangerous driving.
