[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A seafront leisure centre that was badly damaged by sea water in the winter storms will reopen in August, its operators say.

Over 50cm (19in) of water flooded Portsmouth's Pyramids in February, causing extensive damage to the swimming pool's plant room.
The water also severely damaged the building's fabric and mains power was lost.
BH Live, which runs the centre, said repair costs were covered by insurance.
The company said planned improvement works at the centre had also been brought forward during the closure to "limit further disruption in the future".
The leisure centre, owned by Portsmouth City Council, was taken over by the company last year after it came under threat of demolition by the authority amid spending cuts.
