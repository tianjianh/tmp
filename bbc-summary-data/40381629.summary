Winter and Caravaggio gave trainer Aidan O'Brien and jockey Ryan Moore a big-race double at Royal Ascot.

The English and Irish 1000 Guineas winner Winter (4-9 favourite) took victory in the Coronation Stakes.
Unbeaten Caravaggio claimed the sixth win of his career with a brilliant turn of foot in the Commonwealth Cup.
Moore bided his time before pushing the classy 5-6 favourite past the talented Godolphin pair of Harry Angel and Blue Point.
"His change of pace is unbelievable, he's very quick - I don't think we've ever had a quicker horse," said O'Brien.
Winter completed a Group One treble as she defeated stablemates Roly Poly and Hydrangea for an O'Brien 1-2-3 in a repeat of the Irish Guineas result.
The daughter of Galileo passed the post with two and a quarter lengths in hand over Roly Poly.
Her victory followed the triumph for Caravaggio, who won the Coventry Stakes at last year's meeting and impressed jockey Moore.
"I think that was a proper race - he's beaten two very good horses there," he said.
"They made him work but he was going away at the end."
O'Brien indicated Caravaggio could be aimed long term at The Everest, a new contest in Australia which will be the world's richest turf race.
To be held at Royal Randwick in Sydney on 14 October, it is a six-furlong race with $A10m (£6m) in prize money.
BBC racing correspondent Cornelius Lysaght:
Caravaggio retained his unbeaten record with a striking late swoop, easily defeating the very talented Harry Angel in second; Winter kicked aside her rivals in the manner of a real top-notcher, who is likely to be one of the horses of the year.
Flat racing's superpowers are both enjoying good weeks after 24 races staged. That was four for Coolmore, while one of the main talking points has been the resurgence of Sheikh Mohammed and his Godolphin team.
If including the Sheikh's son Sheikh Hamdan bin Mohammed, whose horse Permian put a Derby flop behind him in the Edward VII Stakes, they've had seven wins.
Rare Rhythm won the Duke of Edinburgh Stakes to give Godolphin their sixth win of the meeting.
The five-year-old gelding (20-1), trained by Charlie Appleby, provided jockey William Buick's fourth victory of the week.
Rare Rhythm had not competed since finishing eighth after a troubled run in this race a year ago, and had warmed up with some training runs at Chelmsford Racecourse.
Buick had earlier partnered Permian (6-1), who returned to form after a disappointing run in the Derby to win the King Edward VII Stakes.
The Mark Johnston-trained colt won the Dante Stakes at York in May and was sent off an 8-1 chance at Epsom earlier in the month, but was 10th behind winner Wings Of Eagles.
Trainer John Gosden could have a Classic contender on his hands after Stradivarius hit the right note to win the Queen's Vase from runner-up Count Octave.
Gosden punched the air after victory for the son of 2009 Derby winner Sea The Stars, who is now as low as 8-1 for the St Leger at Doncaster in September.
Stradivarius was ridden by Andrea Atzeni, who had a pint of beer thrown at him before the start of the following race.
Earlier, Different League caused a 20-1 surprise when landing the Albany Stakes.
The filly, trained in France by Matthieu Palussiere, won under Antoine Hamelin from favourite Alpha Centauri.
Bought cheaply in racehorse terms for about £8,000, she was given a warm welcome by her Irish owners including Con Marnane after netting the first prize of more than £45,000.
Royal Ascot concludes with the fifth day of action featuring sprinters contesting the Diamond Jubilee Stakes (16:20 BST).
Limato and The Tin Man feature for trainers who have previously enjoyed success in this six-furlong contest.
Henry Candy won the Group One prize with Twilight Son 12 months ago, and sends Limato out from a high draw in stall 15.
The Tin Man is a major contender for James Fanshawe, who triumphed six years ago with Society Rock.
Dartmouth, owned by the Queen, represents probably Her Majesty's best hopes of a triumph this week.
Last year's victor lines up again in the Hardwicke Stakes (15:40) for Sir Michael Stoute, who needs one more success for an all-time record 76 Royal Ascot wins.
The Wokingham Handicap (17:00) is one of the meeting's big betting races where The Outback Traveller seeks back-to-back victories for Robert Cowell.
(All times BST, distances in miles and furlongs):
14:30: Chesham Stakes 7f
