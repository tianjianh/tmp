Austrian GP: Sebastian Vettel hit with gearbox grid penalty

Sebastian Vettel will be handed a five-place grid penalty at this weekend's Austrian Grand Prix.

Teams are required to run gearboxes for five consecutive races but Ferrari found some debris in the German's gearbox and changed it for reliability.
The problem means Vettel can start no higher than sixth - and will likely be eighth at best - for Sunday's race.
Ferrari abandoned their plans to run the prototype 'halo' head protection in first practice following the problems.
They have not yet decided when or whether they will run the 'halo' again. The version in Austria is different from the one tested pre-season, in that it uses titanium rather than steel and has slightly modified dimensions.
Vettel's gearbox problem is the latest in a series of reliability issues for Ferrari this season as they seek to challenge Mercedes.
