Niall Rowland, Stefan Campbell, Niall Grimley, Andrew Murnin, Rory Grugan and Anto Duffy netted for the Orchard side in a one-sided Athletic Grounds game.
It was much closer in Drogheda with Eoin O'Connor and Ryan Burns getting the Louth goals while Ryan Murray was on target for the Saffrons.
Armagh move up to second with Antrim remaining in relegation trouble.
The Orchard side were aiming to build on last weekend's win over Longford and they made a superb start, surging to a 1-7 to 0-0 lead after just nine minutes.
Rowland fired into the bottom corner while the points came from Stephen Sheridan, Campbell (2), Charlie Vernon, Duffy, Grugan and Murnin.
Offally registered the next four points but there was to be no comeback as the remainder of the game became a procession of Orchard scores.
Murnin set up Campbell for the second goal and Grimley's clinical strike left it 3-10 to 0-6 at the break.
Murnin fisted in after a goalmouth scramble on the restart before Gurgan was presented with a simple finish after a classy Armagh move.
Duffy netted the final goal from a Gavin McParland pass as Armagh put themselves in contention for promotion.
"We planned to get a good start and we backed that up with a decent half-time advantage," said Orchard forward Grugan.
"It just clicked for us - there has been a fresh influx of players which has created a buzz and we've pushed on."
Antrim pushed Louth to the end in a close encounter but lost out by two points.
The opening two goals came early in the game with O'Connor hitting the Antrim net before Murray replied for the Ulster visitors.
Saffrons forward CJ McGourty slotted over to level but points from Bevan Duffy and Paraic Smith gave Louth a 1-3 to 1-1 lead at half-time.
The teams exchanged scores after the interval with Kevin Niblock (2), CJ McGourty and Paddy McBride adding Antrim points.
Louth were just a point ahead when Ryan Burns scored a point before netting a penalty after he was fouled.
The goal proved decisive although Antrim stayed in touch with the impressive CJ McGouty sending over three points.
Despite the defeat Antrim have moved out of the bottom two on points difference after a heavy defeat for Laois.
