[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A senior occupational therapist has been struck off for having a "deplorable" sexual relationship with a vulnerable patient.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Hayley Gillett worked at a residential service for adults with brain injuries when the three year relationship began.
During that time she tried to end the relationship but the patient tried to take his own life twice, the Health and Care Professions Council heard.
He suffered "actual harm" and there was a "serious breach of trust," it said.
A Health and Care Professions Council (HCPC) tribunal panel heard the relationship started in Autumn 2010 and ended in August 2013 when Ms Gillett worked at privately run Waters Park House in Plymouth.
The patient told his GP what had happened in March 2014 and revealed intimate photographs of her on his mobile phone.
She was then suspended while Plymouth City Council carried out a safeguarding investigation.
In a letter to the HCPC, Ms Gillett said: "On two occasions he took an overdose apparently from illegally obtained drugs - and I felt compelled because of my concern for his welfare to continue to care for him and to eventually resume the relationship which he was demanding."
The HCPC said she had made no attempt to seek advice or confess the relationship until she was confronted afterwards and had not only caused her patient "actual harm" but there was also "the potential for long term emotional and psychological harm".
The panel concluded that her name be struck off the register, meaning that she cannot work as an occupational therapist for at least the next five years at which point she may re-apply.
Waters Park House in Plymouth refused to comment.
