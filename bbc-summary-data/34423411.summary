Conservative Bill Sharp denies UKIP assault in Hadleigh

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A Conservative politician has appeared in court to plead not guilty to assaulting a UKIP candidate in the run-up to elections earlier this year.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Bill Sharp, a Tory councillor at Castle Point Borough Council in Essex, is accused of assaulting activist James Parkin at Hadleigh's former fire station in March.
Mr Sharp, 68, of Softwater Lane, Benfleet, appeared before Southend Magistrates to deny the charge.
He is due to stand trial next year.
The assault is alleged to have taken place on 14 March when Mr Sharp, who was deputy leader of the council at the time, was holding a surgery at the fire station.
Mr Parkin was a candidate for the Appleby ward in Castle Point and was also an agent working with Jamie Huntman, UKIP's defeated parliamentary candidate for the Castle Point constituency.
Mr Parkin was campaigning outside the fire station.
Councillor Sharp, who is a cabinet member at the Conservative-run council, was released on bail ahead of a trial due to take place on 4 January.
