Froome, 31, won the Tour de France for a third time in July and then took Olympic bronze in the time trial at Rio 2016 on 10 August.
The Vuelta begins with a team time trial in Ourense, Spain on 20 August and finishes on 11 September in Madrid.
"You could say I have unfinished business," said Froome, who was second in the Vuelta in 2011 and 2014.
He was forced to drop out of the 2015 Vuelta - one of the sport's three Grand Tours, alongside the Tour de France and Giro d'Italia - when he broke a bone in his foot as he hit a barrier on the 11th stage.
Froome finished in 12th in the road race on the first day of competition in Rio, but claimed the time trial bronze medal behind winner Fabian Cancellara four days later.
Team Sky's line-up in Spain is completed by Ian Boswell, Michal Golas, Peter Kennaugh, Christian Knees, Michal Kwiatkowski, Mikel Landa, Salvatore Puccio and Leo Konig.
