Dr Vladislav Rogozov, a consultant anaesthetist at Sheffield's Royal Hallamshire Hospital, spoke about the incident in an online blog.
He said he had confronted the unnamed surgeon when he realised she intended to keep the scarf on during surgery.
Hospital chiefs would not confirm if Dr Rogozov had been suspended.
Headscarves worn for religious purposes are permitted in most areas of hospitals but should be removed in areas such as operating theatres in the interest of patient safety and hygiene, according to hospital rules.
Dr David Throssell, medical director of Sheffield Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, said: "The member of staff has not been excluded from work for raising patient safety issues as we take these very seriously.
"However, since the publication of articles attributed to the member of staff, we have received concerns about the tone he has used.
"On this basis the content and nature of the views published are currently being investigated."
