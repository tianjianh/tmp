EU seeks UN support to tackle migrant smuggling

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini has pleaded for UN help to dismantle criminal groups smuggling migrants into the European Union.

"We need to count on your support to save lives," she told a Security Council briefing on EU plans to use force against smugglers.
Libya, where many smugglers operate, has objected to the EU proposals.
More than 1,800 people are feared to have died this way in 2015 - a 20-fold increase on the same period in 2014.
Some 60,000 people have already tried to cross the Mediterranean this year, the UN estimates.
Many of the migrants are fleeing conflict or poverty in countries such as Syria, Eritrea, Nigeria and Somalia.
Speaking in New York on Monday, Ms Mogherini said the EU's first priority was to "save lives and prevent further loss of lives at sea".
She outlined proposals agreed by EU governments last month. These include:
The EU must seek UN approval in order to establish a clear legal basis for any military operation in Libyan territorial waters.
Diplomats from Italy, the UK, France, Lithuania and Spain are drafting a UN Security Council resolution under chapter seven of the UN charter that authorises the use of force to maintain international peace.
It is as yet unclear what shape military action could take.
Earlier, the Libyan ambassador to the UN told the BBC that the EU's intentions were unclear and that the Libyan government had not yet been consulted.
Is military force the solution?
Why is the EU struggling with migrants and asylum?
Migrant survivors' stories
Ms Mogherini told UN representatives on Monday that an "exceptional response" was needed to deal with the "unprecedented" migrant flow.
But she said the situation was likely to continue as long as Libya lacked a government had authority across the country.
"No refugees or migrants intercepted at sea will be sent back against their will," she added.
Ms Mogherini travelled to Beijing last week to try to build support for a draft resolution, amid concerns that China and Russia would veto the proposal to use military force.
UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon has cautioned against a military solution, warning that it could harm the livelihoods of Libyan fishermen.
Rights group Amnesty International, meanwhile, has cautioned that military action could leave migrants trapped in Libya in desperate conditions.
Without allowing safe alternative routes, the new EU measures "will not resolve the plight of migrants and refugees," the group said in a new report.
On Wednesday, the EU is also expected to propose a quota system for distributing asylum seekers between EU members, along with plans to increase legal means for migrants to come to Europe so that they do not turn to smugglers.
A quota system would need to be agreed by EU states and is highly controversial, with many countries fiercely opposed.
