Glamorgan v Durham: Graham Clark leads visitors' revival at Swansea

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Durham lead Glamorgan by 147 runs going into the final day after reaching 158-3 in their second innings at Swansea

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Graham Clark top-scored with 63 not out after being dropped twice, adding 83 with Paul Collingwood before rain came.
Andrew Salter's career-best of 75 meant that Glamorgan led by 11 on first innings, adding 192 for their last four wickets as they ended 353 all out.
He was supported by Marchant de Lange (30) and Michael Hogan, who hit 29 not out in a last-wicket stand of 74.
Salter's innings just passed his previous best of 73 against Gloucestershire, also at St Helen's in 2015, as he smashed eight fours and three sixes.
Seamer Paul Coughlin finished with 4-87 while opening bowlers Chris Rushworth and James Weighell shared the other six wickets.
Durham then slipped to 75-3 when England Test opener Keaton Jennings was adjudged lbw to David Lloyd's first ball.
But Clark and first-innings centurion Collingwood repaired the damage, Clark riding his luck in particular when De Lange spilled a skied catch, before reaching his 50 off 97 balls with nine fours.
Durham's impetus was halted when bad light and rain intervened at 17:20 BST, and more poor weather is expected overnight.
Glamorgan's Andrew Salter told BBC Wales Sport: "It's funny how I've had both my best innings here in Swansea and also make my debut here as well, so it's one of my favourite grounds.
"I'm very delighted with my performance, but more so because it put us in a position where we could get slightly ahead with that last partnership.
"The wicket's quite flat, but as sometimes happens in Swansea a couple of wickets fall quickly and the game moves forward, it's a tricky one to suss out.
"It'll be interesting to see how they play it, especially with losing some time (to the weather)."
Durham batsman Graham Clark: "First hour this morning we were really good, we put Glamorgan under pressure and credit to their tail-end, they put us under pressure and it swung back in their favour to take the lead which looked unlikely overnight.
"But we've had a good period then to push it back in our favour.
"When (the chance to de Lange) went in the air, I thought that was over for me but luckily he put it down and I could take my chance and carry on.
"I think we'll just be batting (normally) in the morning, there won't be huge pressure to score quickly for the first hour and we'll see where we are."
