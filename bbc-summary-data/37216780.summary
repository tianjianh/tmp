The Welsh region had the game wrapped up at half-time after tries from Parry, Lloyd Ashley and Ashley Beck, with Sam Davies adding the extras.
Tommaso d'Apice struck back before the break, before Parry scored his third rolling maul try following a line-out.
Ben John and Dafydd Howells added further scores for the Pro12 leaders.
Fly-half Davies scored Ospreys' first points of the season with a penalty after Zebre were penalised for not rolling away after just five minutes.
Man-of-the-match Parry bundled over from a rolling maul shortly after following a period of sustained pressure from Steve Tandy's side.
And the scoreline became even rosier for Ospreys when second-row Ashley broke through a gaping hole in the visitors' defence with a charge from the 22-metre line.
Centre Beck was next to touch down when he crashed through two tackles from close range on 25 minutes.
Zebre reduced the deficit when d'Apice rumbled over from a line-out five minutes before half-time, but their good work was soon undone.

Parry forced his way over for his second try on the stroke of half-time with Zebre again unable to stop Ospreys' rolling maul.
It became a night to remember for the 24-year-old when he scored a near replica of his second try seven minutes into the second half.
Parry was replaced midway through the second period, but the onslaught continued with replacement John running in from a fine inside pass from Davies.
Fellow substitute Howells collected a cross-kick from full-back Dan Evans to score with five minutes remaining, before John scored his second after an off-load from Wales flanker Justin Tipuric.
Lock Bradley Davies made his Ospreys debut off the bench after joining from Wasps, while Tipuric started after recovering from concussion.
Tipuric returned during pre-season having not played since landing heavily at a line-out against Italy in the 2016 Six Nations.
