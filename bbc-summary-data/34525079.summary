Fifa presidential candidate Prince Ali bin al-Hussein says any delay in electing Sepp Blatter's replacement would "create further instability".

The Jordanian wants to replace the suspended president of world football's governing body in February's election.
But after Blatter, 79, and Uefa president Michel Platini, 60, were suspended, Fifa is expected to discuss postponing the vote.
Prince Ali said that would "tell the world lessons haven't been learned".
Swiss Blatter and Frenchman Platini, a Fifa vice-president, are both appealing against their 90-day suspensions.
General secretary Jerome Valcke is also suspended. All three deny any wrongdoing.
Confederation of African Football boss Issa Hayatou is interim Fifa president. Platini maintains he will still stand for election on 26 February to replace Blatter.
Prince Ali said: "With Fifa's crisis deepening, the organisation needs to move beyond interim leadership and elect an accountable president.
"Delaying the scheduled election would only postpone needed change and create further instability.  It would tell the world that lessons haven't been learned, that the same backroom deals that have discredited Fifa in the first place continue."
Fifa's emergency meeting is being held on 20 October in Zurich.
The governing body's ethics committee began its investigation after the Swiss attorney general opened criminal proceedings against Blatter in September.
He is accused of signing a contract "unfavourable" to Fifa and making a "disloyal payment" to Platini.
The ethics committee also opened an inquiry into Platini over the 2m euros (Â£1.35m) payment, which was made nine years after the former France footballer carried out consultation work for Blatter.
