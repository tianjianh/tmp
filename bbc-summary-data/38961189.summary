A banker was killed by a single punch for talking to a group of young women, a court has heard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Oliver Dearlove, 30, spoke about shoes and baby pictures after a night out in Blackheath, south London, on 28 August.
The 20-second exchange prompted Trevor Timon to launch an "unprovoked and senseless" attack, jurors heard.
Mr Dearlove was punched once in the head and died hours later. Mr Timon, 31, of Heavitree Road, Plumstead, admits manslaughter but denies murder.
Prosecutor Anthony Orchard QC told jurors at the Old Bailey the attack was "motivated by the defendant's perceived sense of grievance" that Mr Dearlove was talking to women who Mr Timon knew.
The victim lived with his long-term girlfriend in New Eltham and worked in the City as a banker, the court heard.
On the night of the attack he had been out with friends, leaving Zerodegrees bar just after midnight.
As he left he asked a woman, who cannot be named for legal reasons, if she was hurt after she took off her high heels on the street.
She replied: "You know what, my feet are killing me", jurors were told.
She went on to tell Mr Dearlove that it was her first night out since giving birth, and he commented to his friends: "Doesn't she look well?"
The woman produced pictures and Mr Dearlove was "very polite" as he complimented her on having a beautiful baby, jurors heard.
Mr Timon, who knew the group of women, allegedly stormed in and demanded to know what they were talking about.
Mr Orchard said: "The next thing that happened was the defendant hit Oliver Dearlove."
The trial continues.
