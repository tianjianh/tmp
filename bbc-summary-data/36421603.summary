The 22-year-old came through the Championship club's academy but made only 19 appearances for Wolves.
He spent this season out on loan at Shrewsbury and Crawley, scoring twice in 17 matches in all competitions.
"It was close in January - I was nearly coming here on loan and things didn't quite work out," he said.
"As soon as it came about that I was going to be available on a free in the summer, we got back in touch and we've got it done as soon as we could."
McAlinden is Exeter's third summer signing, after Lloyd James and Robbie Simpson.
