Olympic Council of Ireland (OCI) chief Stephen Martin and Kevin Kilty spoke to police for four hours on Thursday.
A chief investigator said the men had confirmed arrested Pat Hickey was responsible for ticket operations, the Associated Press reported.
The former OCI President is being held over alleged illegal ticket sales.
"They cooperated with us in confirming the role of Patrick Hickey as the one who handled ticket operations," said investigator Ronaldo Oliveira.
"All of the actions were decided by him."
Timeline: Olympic ticket-sale scandal
Mr Hickey has previously denied any impropriety over ticketing, and no charges have been brought, but he has stepped down from all his posts temporarily.
He was head of the European Olympic body and also sat on the executive board of the International Olympic Committee (IOC).
Mr Hickey is being held alongside THG director Kevin Mallon at Rio's maximum security Bangu 10 prison.
Mr Martin, from Bangor, County Down, and Mr Kilty had their passports, laptops and mobile phones seized on Sunday.
But police said late on Thursday the men had never been anything other than of assistance to them as important witnesses.
As they left police headquarters dressed in Ireland's team tracksuits, Mr Kilty told reporters: "We are very happy to have cooperated."
A judge will now issue an official decision on whether or not to return Mr Martin and Mr Kilty's passports.
Dermot Henihan, the OCI's secretary general, also had his passport seized. Mr Henihan spoke to police in Rio on Tuesday and was subsequently told his passport would be returned.
Mr Hickey's legal team made a second application for bail on Thursday.
It is understood his lawyers will ask the court to place him under house arrest, instead of in the maximum security prison where he is being held.
On Wednesday, the Irish government published the terms of reference for a state inquiry into the controversy and appointed retired judge Carroll Moran to lead the investigation.
Mr Martin, an Olympian gold medal-winning hockey player, was previously a director of coaching at Ulster Hockey.
