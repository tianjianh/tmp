James Desmarais and David Rutherford were the successful penalty takers for the Giants after the match ended 2-2.
Belfast led 2-1 after the first period thanks to goals from Chris Higgins and Blair Riley, with Alex Leavitt scoring for the hosts.
Leavitt scored again in the second period of the Challenge Cup game.
Neither side could add to their tally in overtime and debutant netminder Jackson Whistle made two fine saves in the shootout to keep out Braehead.
Whistle is the son of Dave Whistle, who was the first ever coach of the Giants.
The Giants were edged out 4-3 by Dundee Stars after over-time in Saturday's Challenge Cup game at the SSE Arena.
Goals from Vinny Scarsella and Joey Sides put the visitors 2-0 ahead after the first period.
David Rutherford and Mark Garside got Belfast on terms in the second period and after Sides restored Dundee's lead, Colin Shields levelled late on.
That meant five minutes of over-time and Brett Switzer sealed Dundee's win.
