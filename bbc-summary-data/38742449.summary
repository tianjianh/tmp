Daniel has been in a race with two American rivals to complete the stunt and, in a forest near his home, he managed to pull off the two full backflips move.
This isn't the first record he has set.
In 2008, he came to the world's attention when he set the world record for the longest backflip of a snowmobile, launching the machine 44.8 metres - that's the width of a football pitch!
Bodin has won three X Games gold medals and he will be hoping to add to those numbers at the upcoming games at the end of this month.
