Cumbria Police claims switching notebooks for smartphones could save the force more than £1m a year.

The force has partnered with telecoms firm EE to issue frontline officers with phones.
The devices are equipped with apps, and the force says using these will give officers more time on the streets.
The scheme is costing about £1.8m over the next three years, with funding being shared between the force and the Home Office.
Ch Supt Steve Johnson said: "We police one of the largest geographical areas in England and Wales, which covers difficult terrain.
"As a result, call and data coverage and communication quality are important factors in mobilising the workforce in order to increase the amount of time officers are able to spend in the community, keeping people safe and dealing with crime."
The force said officers would be able to fill out pre-loaded forms and share them with others instantly, without having to return to police stations.
