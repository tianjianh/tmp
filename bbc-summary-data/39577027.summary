The rare mammal, who has been named Marvel by staff at the animal welfare charity, is believed to be about a month old.
Marvel is being rehabilitated at the Scottish SPCA's national wildlife rescue centre in Fishcross, Clackmannanshire.
Pine martens are protected under the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981.
Rescue centre manager Colin Seddon said Marvel was currently being hand-reared and fed milk from a bottle.
He said: "We will hopefully be able to wean him onto solid food in the next couple of weeks when his eyes open.
"Orphaned pine martens are quite often reared as a group but he's the only one in our care at the moment.
"Pine martens are very rare and protected by law.
"They are currently being introduced back into parts of the UK where they were once persecuted to extinction.
"Once Marvel is fully independent and behaving naturally he will be released at a specially chosen release site with the land owner's permission."
