Welcome to BBC School Report 2016

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
BBC News School Report gives 11-16 year-old students across the UK the opportunity to research and produce their own news reports for a real audience.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Last year, more than 1,000 schools across the UK took part in this diversity award-winning project.
Students reported on a range of issues, from social media addiction to why dancing is not just for girls and  how Muslim women can wear the hijab. Some even interviewed leading politicians.
Using lesson plans and materials from this website, teachers help their pupils develop students' journalistic skills so they can report on the stories that matter to them and make their voices heard.
The project culminates on School Report  News Day - this year to be held on Thursday 10 March 2016 - where all schools taking part produce stories and publish them on their school websites.
There are four Practice News Days - the last one will be on Tuesday 9 February (also Safer Internet Day) - for schools that wish to have a trial run.
Practice News Days are a great opportunity to get your team together and have a go at reporting. Why not take a look at  our News Day lesson plan!
The BBC links to each school webpage, providing a real audience for the reports. Some schools will also get the chance to work with BBC staff and see their work appear on television, radio or the BBC website.
This year is BBC School Report's 10th anniversary, so why not make 2015/16 the year for your school to take  part in the project?
