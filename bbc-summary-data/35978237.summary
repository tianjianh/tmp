The child, who was under 13, needed medical treatment following the attack by Ajay Jetha last year.
A probation report three months earlier warned he might snatch a child "at any time", Leicester Crown Court heard.
Jetha, 32, was told he must serve at least 11 years.

He previously admitted some offences relating to last year's attack but on Monday changed his plea to guilty to all 10 charges relating to the boy, known only as Child A, which included photographing his assault.
He also admitted a further 10 unconnected child sex offences.
During the sentencing hearing on Tuesday, it was revealed just three months before the brutal assault in Leicester a Probation Service report said "he could at any time take a child off the street".
Speaking after the hearing, Lawrence English, from the Crown Prosecution Service, said: "The police were obviously aware of that [report] and were keeping as close an eye on Jetha as they possibly could.
"Obviously it's it's not possible to keep everybody who is on the sex offenders register under observation 24/7."
The National Probation Service said it was "carefully considering" the findings in a review of the case.
The court also heard that in 2004 Jetha was jailed for nine years for kidnapping and indecently assaulting a 12-year-old boy in London.
And in 2014 and 2015 he was handed two suspended prison sentences for failing to provide an address for the sex offenders register in Leicester.
The attack on Child A came while he was on a suspended prison sentence.
Sentencing Jetha, Judge Nicholas Dean QC said: "I consider it to be beyond doubt that Jetha is a highly dangerous predatory paedophile.
"I am satisfied that Jetha will remain dangerous for the rest of his life.
"I reject the submission that he is remorseful. He is not."
Defending Jetha, Barnaby Shaw said: "He recognises only too well the ordeal he put Child A through and the ongoing trauma he has suffered and the ongoing trauma he will suffer in the future."
Jetha admitted false imprisonment, five counts of sex offences against a child under 13, actual bodily harm and three of taking indecent images of a child.
He also admitted nine charges of making indecent images of children by downloading them on to his mobile phone, and one of possessing 85 indecent pictures of children.
