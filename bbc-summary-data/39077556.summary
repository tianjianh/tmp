Ozzy received the PDSA Gold Medal for his actions during the incident in Falkirk in 2015.
Police dog Sweep and civilian dog Sabby were awarded the PDSA Order of Merit, which the charity has dubbed "the animals' OBE."
The three dogs and their handlers received the awards at a ceremony in Edinburgh.
Ozzy, who is nine and has since retired from police service, was called to the incident in Falkirk with his handler PC Brian Tennant.
A man had severed a gas pipe after assaulting two people at knifepoint and was threatening to blow up the building by attempting to ignite the gas with a lighter.
Ozzy tackled the man to the ground where he was disarmed and arrested by PC Tennant.
The officer said: "Ozzy has been a loyal and exemplary police dog throughout his career.
"He has assisted with apprehending numerous criminals, saved lives and prevented countless injuries to members of the public and fellow police officers.
"Receiving the PDSA Gold Medal is a fitting end to his distinguished career, I am incredibly proud of him."
Cocker Spaniel Sweep received his award for outstanding devotion to duty while working as detection dog for Lothian and Borders Police and Police Scotland.
Sabby retired in 2016 after a ten-year career working with the NHS Lanarkshire learning disability occupational therapy service team.
