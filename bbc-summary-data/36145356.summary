[SN]TITLE[SN]
County Championship: Durham & Middlesex settle for rain-affected draw

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Durham and Middlesex had to settle for a draw at Chester-le-Street as only 14 balls were bowled before play was abandoned on the final day.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Rain in the morning meant there was no play until 13:40 BST and, after Durham had collected their third batting point, the covers were brought back on.
Umpires Ian Gould and Graham Lloyd called off play just after 15:00 BST.
Both sides have drawn their opening two Championship matches of 2016 and will go in search of a first win on Sunday.
Middlesex are away at Hampshire, while Durham are at The Oval to face Surrey.
