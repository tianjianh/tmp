Young will host her final Crimewatch next month but will continue to present BBC Radio 4's Desert Island Discs.
"There are very few TV programmes that are part of the national fabric and my years working with the Crimewatch team have been a great privilege," she said.
"With the crucial help of viewers the show has played a pivotal role in solving crimes for more than 30 years."
The show launched in 1984 and asks its three million viewers for information to help crack serious cases. Young added: "Long may that invaluable work continue."
Young's co-presenters are Matthew Amroliwala and Martin Bayfield. Since joining the show in 2008, she has fronted high-profile appeals, including the disappearance of Madeline McCann and the Hatton Garden heist.
As well as hosting Desert Island Discs, she will also front a number of one-off special programmes for the BBC.
They will include a programme honouring the work of Sir David Attenborough in his 90th birthday year and a one-hour special about the Queen's annual festive message, titled Cue The Queen: Celebrating the Christmas Speech.
BBC One controller Charlotte Moore said: "Kirsty has been such an integral part of Crimewatch over the last seven years and she will be greatly missed.
"Nevertheless, Kirsty will continue to play an important role on BBC One and I'm looking forward to her special documentary about The Queen's Christmas message next month."
The BBC said a new Crimewatch presenter will be announced in due course.
