The 21-year-old had a year-long loan with Castleford in 2016 but has now moved to Leigh following their promotion from the Championship.
He came through the youth system at Wigan and made his debut for the Cherry and Whites in 2013.
"He wants to challenge for a first-team spot and can play half-back, full-back or wing," said head coach Neil Jukes.
"He has energy, sharpness and an eye for an opportunity and he will bring freshness to our squad."
