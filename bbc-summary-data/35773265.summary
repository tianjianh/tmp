Boyce, 26, has only made one appearance for the Iron this season, in the FA Cup against Southend in November, but played nine games while on loan at Hartlepool earlier in the season.
Notts boss Jamie Fullarton said: "Boyce brings physicality and he has a hugely strong presence.
"He's a leader and I am happy he has chosen to sign for Notts County."
