Hungary 2-1 Norway (agg 3-1)

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Hungary qualified for their first major tournament finals since 1986 as Tamas Priskin's brilliant goal helped secure a Euro 2016 play-off win over Norway.

The Slovan Bratislava striker, formerly of Watford and Ipswich, ran on to Tamas Kadar's long pass and cut inside before curling a shot into the far corner.
Leading 1-0 from the first leg, Hungary scored again as Markus Henriksen turned a corner into his own net.
Henriksen then struck at the right end for Norway, but it was too late.
Hungary's qualification - their first since the 1986 World Cup - came at the end of a turbulent campaign, during which they used three coaches as they finished third in Group F behind winners Northern Ireland.
After Attila Pinter was sacked last September, and his interim replacement Pal Dardai then stepped aside to focus full-time on his role as coach of Hertha Berlin, German Bernd Storck was appointed in July, and given the task of seeing the team through to the finals.
Norway enjoyed plenty of possession in Budapest, as they had during Thursday's first leg defeat in Oslo, but were once again unable to make it count.
Hungary goalkeeper Gabor Kiraly made excellent blocks in each half to deny Haitam Aleesami and substitute Marcus Pedersen.
In between those two chances, defender Even Hovland hit the post from Martin Odegaard's corner just before half-time, with Balasz Dzsudzsak later hitting the bar at the other end.
The inclusion of Real Madrid's 16-year-old midfielder Odegaard, the youngest international in Norway's history, was one of three changes made by coach Per-Mathias Hogmo in an attempt to wipe out their deficit.
But the teenager was taken off at half-time, and his side's hopes disappeared as Henriksen deflected Dzsudzsak's corner into his own net with seven minutes left.
Henriksen then scored at the other end after Kiraly had beaten out Jo Inge Berget's shot, but despite a late flurry, Norway failed in their attempt to reach a first major finals since Euro 2000.
