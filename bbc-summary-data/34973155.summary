Hillary Clinton emails: Memo criticises Cameron NI approach

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A memo from January 2010 released in the latest batch of Hillary Clinton emails describes David Cameron as "threatening recklessly" the Northern Ireland political process.

The email from her adviser, Sydney Blumenthal, refers to meetings held by the then opposition Conservative Party leader with UUP and DUP politicians.
He writes: "Cameron has intervened, threatening recklessly to destroy a generation of work, in order, potentially, to gain marginal seats in NI in case of a hung parliament."
Thousands more emails from Mrs Clinton's private server while she was US secretary of state have been published.
The memo was written following a session of talks involving then British and Irish prime ministers Gordon Brown and Brian Cowen that would ultimately result in the Hillsborough Castle Agreement in February 2010 and the devolution of justice powers to Stormont.
It referred to secret discussions between the Conservatives with the DUP and UUP at Hatfield House, a stately home in England.
In the May 2010 general election, the Conservatives and Ulster Unionists formed an electoral pact in Northern Ireland, fielding joint candidates under the name Ulster Conservative and Unionist New Force (UCUNF).
BBC Northern Ireland political editor Mark Devenport said the emails were unlikely to affect any relationship between Mr Cameron and Mrs Clinton if she succeeded in her current bid to become US president.
"He would have known that the US State Department would always push for agreement and the emails were probably reflecting what was being briefed by the Labour government at the time," he said.
"The US would always be pushing for the successful conclusion to any talks, and right now, that's where the Conservative government would want them if there was any hiccup in the Northern Ireland political process."
