Sikander Khan threatened a 16-year-old boy with a glass bottle before stealing his iPhone in Blackburn town centre on 28 November last year.
Ten days later, he robbed a man, aged 20, of his phone using an imitation firearm in Oozehead Lane, Blackburn.
Khan, 23, of no fixed address, was jailed for five years and seven months at Preston Crown Court.
He admitted two counts of robbery and one offence of possessing an imitation firearm.
Det Con Andy Lever said: "Sikander Khan is clearly a dangerous offender who showed reckless disregard for his victims.
"While no-one was harmed, Khan used the threat of violence to steal the items."
