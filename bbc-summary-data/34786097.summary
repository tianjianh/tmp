[SN]TITLE[SN]
South of Scotland European boundary switch benefits claimed

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Proposals for a new administrative region for southern Scotland could bring millions of pounds of extra European funding, it has been claimed.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
At the moment Scotland is divided into four areas but the Scottish government is consulting on creating a fifth.
It would include Dumfries and Galloway, the Borders, South Lanarkshire and East, South and North Ayrshire.
South of Scotland Alliance chairman Colin Smyth said the move could bring additional funding to the area.
The alliance - made up of Dumfries and Galloway Council, Scottish Borders Council and Scottish Enterprise - is behind the proposal for the extra region.
European statisticians currently divide Scotland into four large regions - Eastern, North Eastern and South Western Scotland plus Highlands and Islands - to inform regional policy development and determine regional funding.
The Scottish government has now proposed creating the fifth region which would cut the size of South Western Scotland by over a third - stripping out around 833,000 people and combining them with 113,000 from Eastern Scotland.
Mr Smyth said it could have a major impact on southern Scotland.
"This will have a massive benefit to Dumfries and Galloway and that is why this is something that the council, through the South of Scotland Alliance, has actually been lobbying for for some time," he said.
"The final decision will be made by the UK government but we want to keep the pressure on to make sure this is a proposal that is adopted.
"It will make a significant difference to our area - it will take it up to a whole new level when it comes to EU funding.
"We will be able to secure funding that we have missed out on in the past."
