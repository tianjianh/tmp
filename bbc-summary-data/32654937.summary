The tribute, to be led by writer and broadcaster Charlie Brooker, will include a short film highlighting some of the 75-year-old's best-known work.
James received a Bafta Special Award earlier this year.
In 2010 he was diagnosed with terminal leukaemia. Amanda Berry, Bafta chief executive, called him an "incredible talent".
James, she added, was "a great influence on many working in television today" and "a warm, witty and knowledgeable presenter whose programmes [have] left a vivid impression on so many viewers, myself included."
Born in Sydney, Australia, James was educated at Sydney University and Cambridge, where he was president of the Footlights dramatics club.
He began his career as a journalist with The Observer in 1972 and went on present countless television series and specials.
He wrote his first autobiography in 1979 and followed it with more essays, books and, more recently, poetry.
Last year the terminally ill author admitted he he had "started saying goodbye" through his work.
He wrote of having "lungs of dust" in the poem Sentenced to Life.
"Inevitably, you start saying goodbye," he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.
In 2014 he was awarded the President's Medal of the British Academy.
The British Academy Television Awards will be hosted by Graham Norton at the Theatre Royal Drury Lane in London.
The event will also see producer and writer Jeff Pope receive a special award and Channel 4 News journalist Jon Snow receive a Bafta Fellowship.
The ceremony will be broadcast on BBC One and BBC One HD from 20:00 BST.
