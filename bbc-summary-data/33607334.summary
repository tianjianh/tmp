The forward, who helped the United States beat Japan in the 2015 Women's World Cup final, will appear alongside Barcelona's Lionel Messi on the American version of the game.
Canada captain Christine Sinclair features on the cover in Canada.
Women's teams feature in the EA Sports game for the first time this year.
"It is an incredible honour to be one of the first women featured on the cover of EA Sports Fifa," said Morgan, who is the best paid player in women's football.
"I know people all over the world play this game and I'm really excited that Fifa 2016 is putting such an important spotlight on women's soccer."
Until now only men's teams have featured in the game, which was first released in 1993.
However, 12 international women's teams will now be playable, including England, USA and Canada.
In England the game's cover sees new Liverpool captain Jordan Henderson alongside Messi after he beat Harry Kane, Sergio Aguero and Thibaut Courtois in a public vote.
