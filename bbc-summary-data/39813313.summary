Vintage buses to take to Barry, Vale of Glamorgan, streets

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Vintage buses have run to mark 25 years since enthusiasts started a charity to preserve them.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Free trips left from the bus depot in Barry, Vale of Glamorgan, on Sunday using vehicles that used to run in south Wales up to 80 years ago.
A charity was formed in 1992 when enthusiasts got together to preserve a 1961 Cardiff bus they found in Hull.
The Cardiff Transport Preservation Group now has more than 180 members and more than 40 historic vehicles.
These include the oldest bus - a 1933 double decker used by Rhondda Transport, a World War Two-era 1944 Pontypridd bus and a 1968 Cardiff bus from when the city still had overhead wires for electric trolleybuses.
Buses left the depot every half hour between 10:30 BST and 16:30 on Sunday.
