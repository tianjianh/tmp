[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Organiser have been unable to secure the continued use of the site's venue in Ullapool.
The 2017 festival, which will be its 13th year, will be held on the town's pier with support from Ullapool Harbour Trustees.
Organisers said this will mean the event will no longer offer a campsite and tickets will be restricted.
Dates for next year's event are 29 and 30 September.
Over the last 12 years, Loopallu's performers have included Paolo Nutini, Franz Ferdinand, Mumford and Sons and Jake Bugg.
This year's festival's headliners included The Wonder Stuff and The Stranglers.
