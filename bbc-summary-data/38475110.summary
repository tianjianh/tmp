Braintree Town 1-2 Chester

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
James Alabi hit a brace as Chester got back to winning ways with a 2-1 National League win at Braintree.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Braintree took the lead after half an hour when Kris Twardek was given far much time to get a cross in and, after Luke George had miscontrolled that delivery, Jack Midson powered home a header.
Chester got back into the game in the 61st minute after Kane Richards did brilliantly out on the right and sent over a cross, and Alabi reacted quickest to get in front of goalkeeper Sam Beasant to head home.
Tom Shaw then saw a shot deflected over the crossbar before Chester snatched it six minutes from time when Shaw burst through and squared the ball for Alabi to slam home.
Chester midfielder Ryan Lloyd was making his first appearance since tying up a new loan deal for the rest of the season from League One side Port Vale.
Lloyd's former Chester boss Steve Burr, now manager at Southport, had made an offer to take him to Haig Avenue when Lloyd's existing loan ran out on 2 January, but he instead opted to remain at Bumpers Lane.
