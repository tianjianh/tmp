[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Two county councils have merged trading standards services, which they say will enable them to make savings while enhancing front-line services.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Surrey and Buckinghamshire have maintained their local bases in Redhill and Aylesbury but now operate under a single management structure.
No staff have been relocated and no-one has lost their jobs.
Both councils said the "partnership working" would better protect residents from scams and rip-offs.
Buckinghamshire is noted for its food safety and animal welfare work, while Surrey's expertise is doorstep crime.
Surrey County Council said it was "a partnership where both local authorities can achieve more for their local communities and businesses than they could by operating independently".
A spokesman for Buckinghamshire County Council said the pooled resources would save money "over a period of time".
