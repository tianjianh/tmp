The 28-year-old, who won the Premier League title during a season-long loan at Leicester last season, has "extra bone growth" in the joint.
He said he is "bitterly disappointed", adding: "I started to feel some pain in my ankle after returning from the training camp in America.
Dyer signed a four-year contract extension with the Swans in August.
He added: "I saw a specialist last week and the MRI scan revealed the extra bone growth at the back of my ankle. There is not a lot I can do about it."
