[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Talks have taken place between union representatives and Wood Group bosses following a decision by more than 300 offshore workers to take strike action.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Members of the Unite and RMT unions, employed by Wood Group on seven Shell platforms are expected to take part in a 24-hour strike next Tuesday.
It is understood the industrial action was not the focus of Wednesday's talks.
The Wood Group has declined to comment. The RMT told BBC Scotland the strike was still expected to go-ahead.
The dispute is over pay and next week's strike would be the first industrial action of its kind in the offshore industry in almost 30 years.
The RMT and Unite unions said their members who work for Wood Group would stage the stoppage on 26 July over the firm's plans for "swingeing" pay cuts.
The oil services firm said it was "extremely disappointed" by the decision to take strike action.
The unions said it was likely to "severely disrupt" operations on seven Shell platforms in the North Sea - Shearwater, Gannet, Nelson, Curlew, Brent Alpha, Brent Bravo and Brent Charlie.
They said the strike was likely to be followed by several further stoppages.
Wood Group provides maintenance and construction services to the installations, having signed a new three-year contract extension with Shell earlier this year.
