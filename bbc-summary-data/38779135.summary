[SN]TITLE[SN]
Barnet 0-2 Mansfield Town

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Ben Whiteman scored for the second week in a row as Mansfield moved to within two points of the League Two play-off places with a comfortable victory at Barnet.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Stags struck in each half as they leapfrogged their opponents in the table and are now breathing down the necks of seventh-placed Portsmouth after an accomplished display at The Hive.
Whiteman came within a whisker of opening the scoring for Mansfield when his low shot across goal struck the inside of the post and somehow did not roll in.
Jake Kean bravely beat John Akinde to the ball to head a long punt clear before the goalkeeper made a good save with his legs to deny Barnet's Jamal Campbell-Ryce.
The Stags then took the lead on 36 minutes when Whiteman produced a clean finish from the edge of the area from Shaq Coulthirst's lay-off.
The visitors were then awarded a penalty just before the hour mark when Ricardo Santos tripped Coulthirst, who calmly stroked his effort down the middle to give his side an unassailable lead.
