The town, which will mark the 400th anniversary of the Bard's death next month, was selected through a public vote.
Residents can now nominate landmarks, including the playwright's birthplace, to fill the spaces on the board.
Special playing pieces could include a swan and a Shakespeare bust, the game's makers said.
Updates on this story and others in Coventry and Warwickshire
Winning Moves UK said the town had "an abundance of great landmarks from all things Shakespeare like the Royal Shakespeare Theatre, Shakespeare's Birthplace, Ann Hathaway's Cottage and the new statue".
"Of course the town has lots of other splendours and delights from the Holy Trinity Church, the picturesque racecourse and the River Avon," it added.
Councillor Mike Gittus, chairman of Stratford-on-Avon District Council, said it was "wonderful news" in Shakespeare's anniversary year.
Other UK cities to get a Monopoly board include Lincoln, Wolverhampton and Oxford.
Makers have also based the game in Sydney and Las Vegas.
The Stratford-upon-Avon version is due to go on sale in October.
