West Bromwich Albion boss Tony Pulis thinks he has a tougher task at his new club than when he took over at struggling Crystal Palace last season.

Pulis became manager of the Eagles in November 2013 with them in the bottom three of the Premier League, before he took them to a final position of 11th.
He left before the start of this season and took over at West Brom on 1 January after Alan Irvine was sacked.
"The expectations are much more intense here," Pulis told BBC Sport.
"They have been in the Premier League for a number of years, but if you take your foot off the pedal you can get stung."
Saido Berahino scored the only goal as West Brom beat Hull 1-0 on Saturday in Pulis's first Premier League match in charge of the Baggies.
The win was only Albion's second in 11 league games and took them up to 14th, although Pulis said he still wanted to strengthen the squad in the January transfer window.
"There's a lot of work to be done," he added. "It's the shortest period of the season left that I've ever stepped into a club. We only have three weeks of the window left so in some respects it's really tougher than Crystal Palace.
"I had six to eight weeks there to look at the side and see the players I needed to improve. We're looking at a few new players and a few positions.
"The squad needs it and the chairman knows that. But the most important thing is to bring in people that are better than what we have got. I don't want to sign players that are of a similar quality."
