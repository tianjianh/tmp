[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Tjaronn Chery's late winner ensured Queens Park Rangers left Huddersfield Town with all three points.

The Dutchman side-footed home Massimo Luongo's cross at the far post after it had evaded team mate Matt Phillips.
Chery almost opened the scoring early on but his close-range effort from Charlie Austin's shot looped over.
Town's Tom Smith nearly scored a 12th-minute own goal as he deflected Phillips' goal-bound effort inches wide of his own post.
Huddersfield can feel hard done by not to get a point, but Chris Powell's side are still in search of their first win in any competition this season.
Premier League transfer target Austin was inches away from giving QPR the lead 12 minutes before half time as Chery's cross just evaded him.
But that was the only real chance Austin had in the final game before the transfer window shuts on Tuesday evening.
Town were the better side after the break as Martin Cranie had a header cleared off the line, while Ishmael Miller also went close.
But Chery's late winner, which was against the run of play, sent Rangers into fourth place, three points off league leaders Brighton, while Town drop into the relegation places.
Huddersfield manager Chris Powell:
"For us to concede like that, on the balance of the game we had, it's little more than daylight robbery.
"Joe Murphy has only had one save to make and we kept Charlie Austin quiet. It was a big blow to lose.
"It's just the way it's going for us now and our confidence will be low but we'll need each other and must rally round each other as we move forward."
QPR manager Chris Ramsay:

"It's an away win against a very difficult opponent and we kept ourselves in the game.
"We were mindful not to lose but we are always dangerous with the firepower we have up front.
"We didn't play particularly well and this is a hard, unforgiving league. Chery did us a favour and long may it continue."
