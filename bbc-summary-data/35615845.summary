Lord Coe, president of International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF), has threatened to ban Kenya's track and field team from the Olympics if the World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada) finds them non-compliant.
Briton Farah said: "You don't wish it on any athlete who hasn't done anything wrong. But, as for the country, if they don't follow the rules then tough."
Kenya, one of the top distance-running nations, is on a Wada "watch list" although the country's sports minister says they are "fully co-operating" in an effort to prove it is tackling cheating.
Farah, who will compete in the 3,000m at the Indoor Grand Prix in Glasgow on Saturday, won gold in the 5,000m and 10,000m at the London 2012 Olympics and the 2013 and 2015 World Championships.
Asked about Kenya's potential absence from the Rio Olympics this summer, he joked: "If we don't have Kenya, it makes it easier for me, which is great."
Kenyans Geoffrey Kipsang Kamworor, Paul Kipngetich Tanui and Bitan Karoki are possible rivals to Farah.

Adam Gemili, who won 100m silver for England at the 2014 Commonwealth Games in Glasgow, said: "It's good whenever a cheat is caught. It helps to clean up athletics."
Meanwhile, 32-year-old Farah says he will not let the threat of the Zika virus deny him the chance to share further Olympic success with his family.
At London 2012, wife Tania and step-daughter Rihanna joined Farah on the track to celebrate his gold in the 10,000m.
"For me, the Olympics is where it is at," he said. "I want to have that moment for my family no matter what.
"In London, one of the best things ever was having my family on the track. Seeing my wife and daughter there was incredible.
"I believe they are part of me and will be there again. I'm not even thinking about anything like the Zika virus. I want them there and that's it.
"I've been training in Ethiopia for the last six weeks up at 10,000ft in some pretty nice weather.
"Rio is not too far away now and I'm quite excited. It starts here in Glasgow now. This is the road to Rio."
