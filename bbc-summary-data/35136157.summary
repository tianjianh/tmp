Filipino national Arnel Martinez Raymundo, 48, was convicted of attempted murder and voyeurism at Cardiff Crown Court on Thursday.
After the attack in Cardiff on Anna Caladiao, 43, on 12 June, Raymundo fled to London before being arrested.
Judge Eleri Rees said he had not shown "the slightest remorse".
Miss Caladiao told the jury she had been "shocked" to see he had video of a naked woman on a memory stick and she could not be with a "peeping Tom".
The jury heard he stabbed Miss Caladiao in the back at their once-shared home, leaving her with life-threatening injuries.
The mother-of-two was taken to hospital after suffering stomach and lung wounds and kept on a ventilator for six days in intensive care.
She would have died if it was not for the workmen who helped her when she ran into the street, Judge Rees said.
Raymundo fled the scene, bought new clothes and caught a bus to London, but police arrested him 13 days later in Croydon, south London.
In a victim impact statement, Miss Caladiao said she was left "badly scarred" and in need of a wheelchair for weeks.
Miss Caladiao said she was "having nightmares and kept reliving that day", with stress and panic attacks.
"I can still feel the knife going into my body," she said.
Raymundo denied attempted murder and voyeurism after telling police Miss Caladiao fed him crystal meth and he started stabbing randomly during a dream because he "felt scared".
But the jury rejected his claims and found him guilty of both charges.
On jailing Raymundo, Judge Rees said it had been a "ferocious attack", telling him: "At no point did you express the slightest remorse or sympathy. Your behaviour showed a disregard for her life."
