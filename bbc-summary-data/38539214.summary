[SN]TITLE[SN]
Newport County 1-1 Colchester United

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Newport County ended a run of eight straight League Two defeats to hold in-form Colchester United to a 1-1 draw.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The hosts got off to an ideal start when Josh Sheehan's deflected shot from just inside the area found its way into the net but could not build on it.
Chris Porter equalised from the spot after Darren Jones fouled Kurtis Guthrie and Craig Reid missed two key chances for the hosts after the break.
County remain bottom of League Two, six points adrift as Colchester stay sixth.
Newport manager Graham Westley told BBC Radio Wales: "It was a turning point for us. It was important to stop the rot and it's not easy to do that. Credit to the team, I thought they were excellent and doing the things you have to do to win football matches.
"We were dogged, we were resilient. We won our headers and our tackles. We created enough moments in the game to have won it really. As the game wore on, we were the better side."
