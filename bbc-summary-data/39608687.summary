The 34-year-old, who has a famed 16-stone frame, has 17 goals in 48 games for the club since joining them after leaving AFC Wimbledon last summer.
Akinfenwa - also known as "The Beast" - has helped the Chairboys to within four points off the play-off places.
"I know sometimes the strikers get the plaudits, but the work that goes on by everyone is incredible," he said.
"When we cross that line we are together, and I want to thank everyone; the staff, the players and the fans."
