[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Pro-independence campaigners have marched through Glasgow in what organisers describe as a "vibrant and creative people powered event".

The event, which has been organised by the All Under One Banner group, set off from the Botanic Gardens.
It was followed by a rally in the city's George Square attended by thousands of people.
Police Scotland said about 2,500 to 3,000 people had gathered in George Square.
Organisers however claimed that more than 5,000 people had taken part in the march and rally.
One of the organisers of the event, John McHarg, said the march had been inspired by recent events such as the Brexit vote and the decision at Westminster, opposed by SNP MPs, to renew the Trident submarines carrying the UK's nuclear arsenal.
He said: "Scotland did not vote to leave Europe, Scotland did not vote to retain Trident, and we want to show the powers that be that we won't tolerate this.
"Independence now for us is very much back on the agenda."
Supporters of the Union have played down the significance of the march.
Glasgow Conservative MSP Annie Wells said: "At the end of the day, the democracy that really matters is the vote that we cast less than two years ago to say that we wanted to remain part of the United Kingdom.
"We need to get out the back of referendums and actually get on with doing the day job."
