Approval has been given to submit a funding bid for a museum celebrating the achievements of two-time Formula One world champion Jim Clark.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Scottish Borders Council hopes to secure around £700,000 from the Heritage Lottery Fund.
The local authority has committed more than £600,000 and community fund raising hopes to bring in £300,000.
Executive committee councillors have now backed the lottery funding bid for the facility in Duns.
The council has been working with a local trust to take the bid forward.
It would see the existing Jim Clark Room in Duns expanded and enhanced to allow cars and trophies to be put on display.
A total project cost of about £1.65m has been attached to the scheme.
The lottery funding would help to reach that total but a bid must be submitted by the end of the month.
If successful, it is hoped the project could be completed by 2018 - the 50th anniversary of Clark's death at Hockenheim in Germany, aged just 32.
The driver was born in Kilmany in Fife, but raised near Duns in the Borders, and was crowned Formula One world champion in 1963 and 1965. He won a total of 25 grand prix races.
