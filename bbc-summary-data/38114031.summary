Crystal Palace 3-0 Southampton

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Two goals from Christian Benteke helped Crystal Palace gain a much-needed win over Southampton to ease the pressure on Eagles boss Alan Pardew.

The hosts went ahead when Saints goalkeeper Fraser Forster, in front of watching England manager Gareth Southgate, sliced a clearance and Benteke scored from close range.
Palace doubled their lead when an unmarked James Tomkins prodded home from three yards out after a corner.
Benteke grabbed his second late on as he tapped in after Jason Puncheon's pull-back as Palace secured their first win in eight matches.
Before today, Crystal Palace had lost their last six games, a run that had led to Pardew saying the club was in a "mini-crisis".
There was speculation in the national newspapers this morning that the Eagles boss, who has been in charge at Selhurst Park since January 2015, would lose his job if his side did not win.
If ever he needed some good fortune it was today, and Pardew got it as his side were gifted a 33rd-minute lead.
There seemed to be little danger when Saints captain Jose Fonte rolled a soft backpass to Forster, but with the ball bobbling up, Forster produced an air-kick to gift Benteke the chance.
Three minutes later Palace doubled their advantage as Tomkins converted from Joe Ledley's flick-on with the Saints defenders inexplicably not tracking his run.
Southampton had lots of possession in the second half, but Benteke wrapped up the points with his second and Palace's third, much to the delight of Pardew and Palace chairman Steve Parish, who gave a thumbs up to the Eagles boss.
Southampton were playing their 22nd game of the season and how their squad copes with an intense run of fixtures will be critical to their hopes of success.
The club are in the semi-finals of the EFL Cup and will advance into the knockout stages of the Europa League if they beat Israel side Hapoel Be'er Sheva on Thursday.
Saints made seven changes from the side that beat Arsenal 2-0 in the EFL Cup on Wednesday, but they looked tired and switched off defensively with two of Palace's goals coming from poor marking that enabled Tomkins and Benteke to score unmarked from close range.
Palace had conceded 17 goals in their past five matches and had not previously kept a Premier League clean sheet this season.
However, Southampton did not test home goalkeeper Wayne Hennessey and, apart from a misjudged header from Virgil van Dijk which looped up on to the top of the crossbar, they offered little in attack.
The hosts soaked up a lot of Southampton possession in the second half, with home defenders Tomkins, Scott Dann and Damien Delaney excelling, but Saints' lack of creativity will concern boss Claude Puel.
Today was the first of seven Southampton matches in December, with them playing a minimum of seven fixtures in January as well and how Puel manages to rotate his squad will be crucial.
Crystal Palace manager Alan Pardew: "I'm pleased for the club and it was important that we won. The discipline was good.
"When the pressure racks up in the Premier League it's hard but we got the balance right and we had some good attacking play.
"When you've been manager at Newcastle and the whole town lives and breathes football, you have to be able to cope with pressure. The pressure sometimes there was intense. It wasn't as bad this week."
About the thumbs up he gave his chairman Steve Parish, Pardew added: "We have a lot of serious investors at the club who perhaps don't know a lot about football so the chairman has been defending me this week, so I just wanted to say thanks."

Southampton manager Claude Puel: "It is frustrating because it was a good opportunity for us to stay in the top half of the table. The first-half performance was not sufficient. We just played for the last five minutes.
"We tried to play in the second half with good movement and we created chances, but it was not enough to win the game. We did not keep good concentration. It was a bad day."
On Fraser Forster's error for the first goal, Puel added: "Perhaps it was bad luck but it happens. The pitch today was bad but it is not an excuse."
