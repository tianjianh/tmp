Jamie Day: Braintree Town appoint ex-Welling and Ebbsfleet manager as boss

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Braintree Town have appointed Jamie Day as their new manager following Danny Cowley's move to National League rivals Lincoln City.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Day, 36, resigned as assistant manager of Forest Green last month after they parted company with boss Ady Pennock.
He previously spent five and a half years in charge of Welling United before moving to Kent rivals Ebbsfleet.
Cowley led Braintree to third place this season before losing to Grimsby in the play-offs.
BBC Essex sports producer Glenn Speller
"Braintree work with a tight budget and are very much part-time so they were looking for someone willing to work within those tight parameters in a tough league.
"Day has a difficult act to follow after the success of Danny Cowley and his predecessor, Alan Devonshire."
