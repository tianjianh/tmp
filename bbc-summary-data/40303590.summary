UK ministers inflated fire sprinkler cost, says Labour AM

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Labour AM behind a law that made it compulsory for new homes in Wales to have sprinkler systems has said she was "astonished" by how UK ministers would "inflate" the costs of installing them.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Ann Jones said she had huge opposition from ministers and officials who feared a "knock-on effect in England".
Ms Jones said fitting sprinklers in older homes should now be considered.
Thirty people are now known to have died and many more are missing after Tuesday night's Grenfell Tower fire.
The blaze broke out shortly before 01:00 BST on Wednesday in the block of flats in west London which was built in the 1970s.
The Vale of Clwyd AM said her law, which applies to all houses and flats built in Wales since January 2016, was strongly opposed by the Department for Communities and Local Government (CLG).
She told BBC Radio Wales: "I got it through despite huge opposition from UK ministers in CLG and officials in CLG who didn't want to see this legislation going through because they were aware that if it goes through in Wales it would then have a knock-on effect in England.
"I was astonished to see how UK ministers could inflate costs of installing sprinkler systems and yet we see the tragedy that's happened today and if the Lakanal House recommendations [after a 2009 tower block fire in south east London in which six people died] had been carried out and if there had been more emphasis put on the recommendation that tower blocks should be retro-fitted with sprinklers then perhaps we wouldn't be seeing the tragedy that we've got."
Ms Jones said that whilst her the legislation does not require the "retro-fitting" of sprinklers "I would urge everybody to look at whether they can".
"Wales has become the first country to make the fitting of sprinkler systems mandatory, and I would like to see the UK government and the ministers put a commitment that they will put fire safety higher up the agenda - that they will stop talking about the costs because, for me, it's a small amount of money to have...to have a fire fighter ready and waiting in every room 24/7," she added.
Regulations in England mean that only buildings constructed since 2007 and which are taller than 30m are required to have sprinklers fitted. This requirement wasn't applied retroactively so did not apply to Grenfell Tower, which was built in 1974.
Existing high-rises in England must have them fitted if a fundamental change is made to the structure or use of the building.
These regulations are the same in Northern Ireland. In Scotland all new residential buildings taller than 18m must be fitted with sprinklers.
Although in Wales, since last year, all new and refurbished residential accommodation must have sprinklers nowhere in the UK is it a requirement to retroactively fit sprinklers in existing buildings.
