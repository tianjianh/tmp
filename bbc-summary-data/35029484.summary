[SN]TITLE[SN]
Cardiff woman, 82, 'indecently assaulted girl under 13'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An 82-year-old woman accused of historical sexual abuse against a young girl has appeared in court.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Elizabeth Mulcahy, of Llandaff, Cardiff, has been charged with six counts of indecent assault against a female under 13.
The offences are alleged to have taken place in the late 1970s and early 1980s.
The jury, sworn in at Cardiff Crown Court on Monday, heard Mrs Mulcahy had denied all the charges.
Clare Wilks, prosecuting, said the woman had shown the girl medical journals of female and male genitalia and touched her inappropriately.
"The defendant said if she was to say anything about what happened there would be serious consequences," Ms Wilks added.
The trial continues.
