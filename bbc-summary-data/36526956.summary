Super League: Castleford Tigers 22-24 Hull FC

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Hull FC moved two points clear at the top of Super League after a narrow win at Castleford Tigers.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Luke Dorn and Jake Webster tries put the hosts in front but Frank Pritchard, Danny Houghton and Mahe Fonua saw the league leaders 18-8 ahead at the break.
Paddy Flynn and Denny Solomona crossed for the Tigers as they drew level.
But Leon Pryce set up Jamie Shaul to put Hull ahead again and when Solomana acrobatically scored, Danny Tickle missed the conversion for a draw.
Lee Radford's Hull FC side have won nine matches in a row in all competitions and have not been beaten since 14 April when they lost to reigning champions Leeds.
The leaders had not won at Castleford in their last four visits, but the difference proved to be the boot of Marc Sneyd who added the extras to all four of their tries, whereas Cas only converted one.
The Tigers have now lost their last five matches in a row in Super League at Mend-A-Hose Jungle and sit seventh in the table.
Castleford head coach Daryl Powell:
"I thought it was a great effort with the team we put out. We had our chances.
"It was very close. They've been used to winning tight games, they've been doing that all year, and they just about got away with it today.
"I thought we probably deserved to win the game. You wouldn't have grumbled either way I don't think."
Hull FC head coach Lee Radford:
"I'm not pleased with the performance, but what I am pleased with is the fact we've been able to break Castleford's momentum on a couple of occasions during the game, which is something we've not been able to do here for a few seasons.
"The number of errors is the most disappointing part. We were stubborn for each other in defence and I'd love to be able to pierce that defence with not making the errors.
"It's something we're going to have to get better at. There are a few things to fix up and everyone in that dressing room knows there's a lot of improvement in us."
