Helen Bur, 25, and Sam Worthington, 30, who make up the arts collective Modern Alchemists, painted the mural on a wall on Barrack Lane.
The pair used more than 70 litres (15 gallons) of paint and it took them a week to finish.
The artwork was commissioned by housing association Linc Cymru, which owns the development.
Artist Ms Bur said: "Linc is intrinsically about housing and care.
"This prompted us to play around with the concept of home, the importance of having somewhere called home and how challenging it can be, especially at this time of year, not to have a home.
"This was the inspiration behind our mural."
