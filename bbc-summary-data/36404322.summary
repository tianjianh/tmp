The plane - a single-seater P-47 Thunderbolt - went down two miles (3.2km) south of George Washington Bridge.
Divers later recovered a body - believed to be that of the pilot - from the submerged plane.
The cause of the crash has not been confirmed, but engine failure has been cited as a possible cause.
The plane was one of three that flew from an airfield in Farmingdale, east of New York City.
They were taking part in shooting a promotional video to mark the 75th anniversary of the American Airpower Museum.
The two other aircraft - a P-40 and a plane taking the photographs - returned safely to the airfield.
Scuba divers recovered the body of a 56-year-old man three hours after the crash. New York police identified the man as William Gordon of Key West, Florida.
College student Siqi Li saw the plane crash into the river.
"It made kind of a U-turn, and then there was a stream of smoke coming from it,'' he told New York's Daily News.
"It was tilting down toward the water. I thought they were doing some sort of trick."
In 2009, the pilot of an airliner with 155 passengers and crew made an emergency landing in the Hudson.
All those on board were later rescued in what later became known as the "Miracle on the Hudson".
