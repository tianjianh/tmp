A triple murder suspect found dead following a 30-hour manhunt died as a result of hanging, a post-mortem examination has shown.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The body of Jed Allen, 21, was found in woodland in Oxford on 25 May.
It came two days after his six-year-old half sister, his mother and her partner were found dead at their home in Vicarage Road, Didcot.
Janet Jordon, 48, Derrin Jordon, aged six, and Phillip Howard, 44, were stabbed to death.
Inquests into their deaths are due to open on Wednesday.
Thames Valley Police said that a post-mortem examination carried out by a Home Office pathologist gave a provisional cause of death as hanging.
Identification will be formally confirmed by the coroner.
