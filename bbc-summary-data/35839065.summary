The Iron, under new manager Graham Alexander, dominated a scrappy first half as goalkeeper Adam Davies saved George Williams' low effort and Jim O'Brien twice shot wide.
Conor Hourihane came close for Barnsley after the break but goalkeeper Luke Daniels tipped his effort over the bar.
Josh Brownhill's strike in the final minutes then went wide for the Tykes.
The draw keeps Barnsley in the final League One play-off position, just one point ahead of Bradford City.
Scunthorpe United manager Graham Alexander told BBC Radio Humberside:

"We were the better team in the first half. We caused some problems and mixed the play up really well when we had possession.
"I don't think some of the decisions helped. There were too many nothing 50/50 goings against us. But I want to have a good relationship with referees and he was good enough to have a proper chat with me.
"For the team and the players the effort was fantastic. You could see the determination to get a result."
