Clive Goodman claims Andy Coulson made 'lone wolf offer'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Andy Coulson perjury trial has been told he asked another journalist to be a "lone wolf" and take the blame for phone hacking at the News of the World.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Former Royal Editor Clive Goodman said his then editor, Mr Coulson, suggested that if he pleaded guilty to hacking he could remain at the newspaper.
He said it was "despicable" that he was expected to present himself as a "lone wolf" in order to keep a job.
Mr Coulson, 47, denies lying at the Tommy Sheridan perjury trial in 2010.
Mr Goodman was giving evidence at the High Court in Edinburgh for a second day.
He told the court that when he was arrested during a police investigation into phone hacking he found it "pretty confusing and frightening".
The witness said the paper's managing editor Stuart Kuttner gave him a lift home from the police station and was "very keen" to question him about what he had said and "what might implicate other people".
Mr Goodman said that in a phone call, Mr Coulson later encouraged him to plead guilty, to "make a clean break".
He told the court that he had "enormous concern" that he would be "left as the fall guy, blamed for everything".
The witness told the court he later met Mr Coulson at a cafe in Wimbledon, where the editor initially voiced concern for him and his family.
He said that during the meeting Mr Coulson told him to plead guilty to hacking and said there could be a "way back" for him at the paper "on a reasonable salary".
Mr Goodman said it was "despicable" that he was expected to present himself as a "lone wolf" in order to keep a job.
He said he had not discussed details of the case with Mr Coulson, but that his editor already considered the case "watertight".
He said he made a full note of his meeting with Mr Coulson as he was feeling "suspicious".
The court was shown a typed transcript of the note in which Mr Goodman said he was told his salary would be paid to his wife if he was jailed - if he told police he "went off the reservation".
Mr Goodman said he was sentenced on 26 January 2007, and dismissed from the News of the World within three days.
He appealed against the decision through the newspaper group's internal process and wrote a letter to HR setting out his grounds.
Part of Mr Goodman's letter was read to the jury.
It said: "The decision is perverse in that the actions were carried out with the full knowledge and support of the editor Andy Coulson."
The letter also stated that the decision was inconsistent since other members of staff "were carrying out the same procedure".
Mr Goodman confirmed to the court that by "procedure" he was referring to phone-hacking.
A settlement was eventually agreed by Mr Goodman and the paper, the jury heard.
The jury later saw email conversations between the witness and Mr Coulson, while they still worked together, which they heard related to the purchase of a "green book" or telephone directory used by members of the royal household.
In an email dated 24 January 2003, Mr Goodman wrote: "Andy - one of our royal policemen (St James Palace) has obtained a brand new green book, the telephone directory with all the home numbers of the royal family and their household staff."
The email went on: "The standard price is Â£1,000."
A reply from Mr Coulson states: "This is fine. Didn't I sign off on purchase of green book quite recently though?"
Mr Goodman said in a further message: "In December - that was Â£750 for the internal phone directory. Lists all the staff at BP, SJP and Windsor with their external numbers and direct lines.
"This is the hardest to get one which has the Queen's direct lines to her family in it."
Mr Goodman was shown a document in court which he identified as the "Â£1,000 one" and agreed with Advocate Depute Richard Goddard, prosecuting, that it was "one of the items that Mr Coulson had given you permission to buy".
He told the court he had got them from "people in journalism" who had passed them on to him.
Mr Goddard said: "Why did you tell Andrew Coulson that you got it from a copper?"
Mr Goodman said: "It's very common for journalists to exaggerate their sources."
The charge against Mr Coulson alleges that he lied in court when he appeared as a witness at Mr Sheridan's perjury trial and that before August 2006 he did know about phone hacking, did know or know of a private investigator Glenn Mulcaire and did know about payments by the newspaper to corrupt police officers.
The trial before Lord Burns continues.
