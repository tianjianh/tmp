The Isle of Man museum has appealed for information about a "below stairs" maid from the 1930s, ahead of the launch of a woman's history project in March.

Dolly Evans worked for the Gibb family at The Grove, Ramsey during the 1930s.
A museum spokesman said information was needed for the History in Heels project which aims to shine a light on some of the island's "remarkable women".
Nicola Tooms, Curator at Manx National Heritage, said she hopes the community can help fill in the gaps.
She added: "As is often the case with the lives of working-class women, her story is less well documented, but we are eager to learn more about her.
"As part of our 'History in Heels' project we wanted to highlight the story of The Grove, a matriarchal household if ever there was one, with Grannie, Auntie, and the two girls, Janet and Alice Gibb.
"We know a fair amount about the lives of the Misses Gibb through the archives we acquired from them but not much is known about another female member of the 'below stairs' household, their maid Dolly".
The Gibbs, a wealthy merchant family from Liverpool, built The Grove as a summer retreat in about 1840.
It is now a museum run by Manx National Heritage.
The History in Heels project aims to celebrate the 65th anniversary of the formation of the Isle of Man Women's Institute.
