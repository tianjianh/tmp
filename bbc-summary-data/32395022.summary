[SN]TITLE[SN]
Dr Christopher Brett Valentine guilty of photos misconduct

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A Glasgow-based doctor has been found guilty of misconduct after he admitted taking 53 photos of two vulnerable patients without their consent.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Dr Christopher Brett Valentine took the photos at addiction clinics in the city and showed them to colleagues after storing them on his iPad and computer.
He also admitted there was no clinical reason for taking the pictures and they were not for teaching purposes.
The misconduct ruling followed a fitness to practise panel hearing.
The Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service examined the evidence against Dr Valentine at a hearing in Manchester.
It was alleged that between January 2012 and April 2013 Dr Valentine took about 53 pictures of two patients without adequately explaining the reason for doing so or obtaining their consent.
It was also alleged that he did not gain the patients' consent for storing the photographs on his personal iPad and computer.
It was further alleged that Dr Valentine allowed colleagues to view the photographs without adequate reason and without the consent of patients.
