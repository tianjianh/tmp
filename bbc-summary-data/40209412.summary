[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A recount was held before it was confirmed Labour's Paul Williams had taken Stockton South.
He secured 26,102 votes, 888 more than ex-Northern Powerhouse Minister Mr Wharton, who had held it since 2010.
Simon Clarke beat Labour's Tracy Harvey by 1,020 votes in Middlesbrough South and Cleveland East
Labour's Helen Goodman held Bishop Auckland by 502 votes.
Labour kept Redcar, Hartlepool, Darlington, Stockton North, Middlesbrough and Sedgefield.
Mr Williams began his career as a junior doctor 20 years ago at what was known then as South Cleveland Hospital.
He said: "[Election night] brought back some memories of what it's like to go through a night without any sleep.
"Our manifesto said a lot of things to people. I've tried to run an energetic campaign. I've had the privilege of meeting thousands of people over the last few weeks... and listened to them.
"It feels as though Mrs May's gamble of going out to an election trying to create some certainty and stability has backfired - it looks like her position is untenable."
He added he will keep working as a doctor "in his own time".
Mr Wharton said: "Clearly it was a very disappointing result.
"I have been very privileged and fortunate to represent my home town to the best of my ability."
He said he could not "pinpoint" reasons for the loss but there had been a redistribution of votes from other parties to the Conservatives and Labour which had been "just enough to get Labour over the line".
Across the area, Labour's share of the vote rose by 9% and the Conservatives' by 10%.
UKIP's dropped by 14% and the Liberal Democrats and Green Party each fell by 2%.
In Bishop Auckland, Helen Goodman saw her majority cut by 3,006, although her share rose from 41% to 48%.
The Conservatives' Christopher Adams saw his share rise from 32.5% to 47%.
Ms Goodman, a critic of Jeremy Corbyn, was asked if her party's leader had been "vindicated" by the election results.
She said: "I wouldn't say Jeremy has been vindicated, I think it was Labour values that run much more deeply in our community that really were vindicated."
Darlington Labour MP Jenny Chapman saw her share of the vote increase 43% to 51% and her majority increase by 122 to 3,280 in the general election.
Ms Chapman, who said she "had no speech for this outcome", added the result was a "shock".
She said: "I just want to thank everybody who took part in this election - everybody who voted, many who voted for the first time in this election today."
In Hartlepool, Labour's share under Mike Hill rose from 36% to 52.5% and the majority increased by 4,626.
UKIP's Philip Broughton saw his share of the vote drop from 28% in 2015 to 11.5%.
Mr Hill said he was "proud" of being elected and of the 59% turnout in his area.
He said: "It is a real testimony to the democratic process."
Sitting Middlesbrough MP Andy McDonald saw his majority rise from 57% to 66% and his majority increase by 1,396.
Simon Clarke saw the Conservative share of the vote in Middlesbrough South and East Cleveland rise from 37% to 50% although his majority is 1,248 less than Labour's had been.
Mr Clarke said "it was an exceptionally close result" and had been a "very difficult night" for his party.
He said: "People here wanted Brexit delivered, they want to see us leave the European Union and get the right deal.
"I'm really delighted they put their trust in me and I promise I will deliver."
In Redcar, Labour's Anna Turley saw her share rise from 44% to 55.5% but her majority was cut by 903.
Labour's Phil Wilson saw his share increase from 47% to 53% but his majority dropped by 784.
Mr Wilson said Theresa May "wanted to look presidential" by calling the election.
"People knew there was something not quite right here, considering the same person said on more than one occasion there would not be an early election," he said.
Alex Cunningham's share in Stockton North rose from 49% to 57% and his majority increased by 348.
He said he fought a "localised campaign" based on preserving and improving health services in the area.
Mr Cunningham said: "The people of Stockton North delivered me an increased majority."
In Stockton South, Labour's share under Paul Williams rose from 37% in 2015 to 48.5% with a majority of 888.
Mr Wharton had had a majority of 5,046.
