St Abbs lifeboat link ends after 104 years

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The RNLI has closed its lifeboat station in St Abbs, bringing to an end a 104-year association with the Scottish Borders village.

The charity said there was "not a clear need" to have a separate facility so close to its Eyemouth station.
It said it was confident the area could be safely covered by an extra boat provided at Eyemouth.
Campaigners opposing the closure are now looking at setting up an independently-run station.
The RNLI said the St Abbs lifeboat only launched about nine times a year, with a third of those being joint services with Eyemouth.
It said the new boat could reach St Abbs in "five to 10 minutes, depending on conditions".
Operations director George Rawlinson said: "Closing a lifeboat station is never an easy thing to do and this decision was made only after extensive research that considered the location of existing search and rescue assets and changing patterns of sea use.
"The review concluded that the area should be covered from one lifeboat station, rather than two stations so close together.
"St Abbs and Eyemouth are only two miles apart - and the coastline can be covered by placing an inshore lifeboat alongside the all-weather lifeboat already stationed at Eyemouth."
Mr Rawlinson said the charity was "very aware" of the impact of such change on local communities and did not take such decisions lightly.
However, he said it had to be mindful of its responsibility to make best possible use of donations.
"I know that this is a sad day for the community of St Abbs and the lifeboat station - the lifeboat station has served the RNLI proudly for over 100 years," he said.
"I'd like to take the opportunity to thank them for their support, service and commitment to saving lives at sea."
Opponents said the decision to close was "an error of judgement, based on flawed data".
They have argued lives will be put at risk due to the extra time needed to get from Eyemouth to St Abbs.
They also delivered a 13,000-signature petition against the move to the RNLI.
Earlier this week, campaigners announced plans to look at delivering an "entirely independent" lifeboat station in the village.
The RNLI said it would be happy to work alongside such a station as it does with others around the coasts of the UK and Ireland.
