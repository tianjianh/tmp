A Labour politician claims she used Twitter to link the Pakistani flag with the grooming of girls in the area.
Simon Danczuk, who's been the town's MP since 2010, accused the columnist of "causing trouble" to create headlines.
He has sent an email to Greater Manchester's Police Commissioner, Tony Lloyd, asking him to investigate whether a crime had been committed.
Mr Lloyd's office told Newsbeat that the complaint has now been forwarded to Greater Manchester Police.
The reality TV star began tweeting after Mr Danczuk attended the raising of a Pakistani flag for half an hour over Rochdale's town hall to mark National Pakistan Day on 23 March.
The 40-year-old posted a series of messages including a picture of eight men convicted of child exploitation offences.
She asked Mr Danczuk, who had tweeted a picture of himself at the event, if they were his friends.
Explaining his decision to make the complaint, Mr Danczuk said: "It is not right that somebody who has little to do with Rochdale incited hatred of this kind.
"Rochdale is a very cohesive community - people work well together.
"Of course there are tensions, like there are in other communities, but people rub together really well and we don't need outsiders like Katie Hopkins to come in and cause trouble just for the sake of causing trouble and creating Sun headlines."
Newsbeat has contacted Katie Hopkins for a response, but so far has not received one.
However, she did reference the situation in a tweet on Sunday, as well as referring to Mr Danczuk's admission that he watches porn.
Katie Hopkins, 40, finished third on The Apprentice in 2007 and has also since appeared on I'm a Celebrity... Get Me Out of Here! and Celebrity Big Brother.
She writes a column for The Sun, appears as a commentator on This Morning and stood as a candidate in the European Parliament election in 2009.
