[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Rovers had been unbeaten in the league since 10 September, but were left stunned by two late goals in the space of three minutes.
The hosts took the lead in the 25th minute when play was switched to the left and Dan Wishart had plenty of time to pick out Christian Doidge with a cross and he headed in for his seventh goal of the season.
Rovers doubled their advantage 20 minutes into the second half as Elliott Frear laid the ball back to Keanu Marsh-Brown just outside the area and he fired low into the bottom left corner of the net.
Lincoln quickly responded and pulled one back four minutes later through Alex Woodyard after Nathan Arnold was denied, before captain Luke Waterfall volleyed in an 89th-minute equaliser.
There was still time for more drama in the first minute of injury time as Sam Habergham's corner was headed in by Sean Raggett to spark jubilant scenes in the away end.
