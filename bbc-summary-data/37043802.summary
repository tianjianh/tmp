Top Gear presenter Matt LeBlanc has said he is keen to return for a second series of the motoring show, but does not know what the future holds.

Speaking to TV critics in LA, LeBlanc added: "There's nothing officially happening yet. Follow the BBC."
Top Gear's prospects were thrown into doubt in July when his co-host Chris Evans announced he was stepping down.
Speaking after his departure, Evans said the series had proved LeBlanc and Top Gear "were made for each other".
Former Friends star LeBlanc was "the man" and a "total mensch", Evans said, scotching reports that the pair's relationship broke down during filming.
Asked by the critics what he liked most about the job, LeBlanc said "probably the travel" to countries including South Africa, Morocco and Ireland.
He also said he liked the show's "broad demographic".
"Everybody can relate to an automobile," he added.
The BBC has said it has no plans to replace Evans when Top Gear returns for a 24th season.
Evans' resignation followed falling ratings, with overnight audiences dropping from 4.4 million to 1.9 million viewers during the course of the 23rd series.
Evans said working on the show had been an "honour, privilege and pleasure", and he had tried his best at the helm but it "was not meant to be".
He had been "a square peg in a round hole", he added.
Evans and LeBlanc were the main presenters on a team of six, which also included Rory Reid, Sabine Schmitz, Chris Harris and Eddie Jordan. The Stig also returned for the reversioned show.
They took over from Jeremy Clarkson, Richard Hammond and James May, whose new venture with Amazon, the Grand Tour, is expected to be released in the autumn.
LeBlanc was speaking to critics while promoting his new show Man With A Plan on American network CBS, in which he plays a father who cares for his children after his wife takes a full-time job.
Evans continues to host his BBC Radio 2 breakfast show.
