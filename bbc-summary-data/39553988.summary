The Labour leader first worked as a colliery blacksmith before becoming a community health council chief officer.
He had said he would stand down in May after nearly 40 years as a councillor.
First Minister Carwyn Jones said Mr Reynolds was a "dedicated public servant who worked tirelessly for the people of Aberbargoed", the ward he represented since 1979.
"His passing will be felt deeply not just by his family and friends but by communities across Caerphilly where he made his impact as a councillor, local campaigner, and civic leader."
Caerphilly council's deputy leader David Poole added: "Keith was an outstanding public servant, who had an unrelenting drive and determination to do his very best for his local community and for our county borough."
