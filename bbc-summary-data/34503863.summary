Bill Cosby testified under oath for several hours on Friday in response to a civil case brought by a woman who accused him of sexually abusing her.

Lawyer Gloria Allred, who represents Judy Huth, said her client would seek a second deposition - giving out-of-court evidence - of Mr Cosby on Thursday.
Ms Allred added that a judge would decide in December if either testimony could be made public.
Mr Cosby, 78, has previously said Ms Huth's claims are "absolutely false".

Ms Huth has accused the former Cosby Show star of forcing her to perform a sex act at the Playboy Mansion in Los Angeles in 1974 when she was aged 15.
It was the first time the veteran comedian has testified under oath since dozens of women came forward with accusations of sexual abuse, many of which are historic claims.
Mr Cosby has never faced criminal charges over the allegations which he has denied.
He also faces two other cases: a defamation case brought by three women who claim he abused them decades ago and a civil case filed last Tuesday by a model who alleges he drugged and sexually assaulted her.
In relation to the defamation case, a federal judge in Massachusetts on Friday ruled it could go ahead.
The women - Tamara Green, Therese Serignese and Linda Traitz - claim that Mr Cosby's representatives damaged their reputations by denying their allegations in sometimes disparaging language.
Mr Cosby's lawyers had asked the judge to dismiss the case, arguing the remarks were personal opinions protected by the First Amendment and legal declarations made in his defence.
But in his ruling on Friday, US district court judge Mark Mastroianni rejected Cosby's bid to dismiss the case before it goes before a jury.
The trio have accused Cosby of drugging them and then having unwanted sexual contact with them.
