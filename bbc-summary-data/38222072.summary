[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Dyfed Edwards, leader of the council's Plaid Cymru group, has said he will not stand for re-election to the council after 13 years.
Mr Edwards was elected to the council in 2004 and became leader in 2008 -  he will be the council's longest serving leader when he steps aside in 2017.
He said: "I had no intention of being a councillor for life."
He will also step down from his seat on the council as representative for the Penygroes ward.
Mr Edwards, who has been outspoken about council cuts in his role as deputy presiding officer for the Welsh Local Government Association (WLGA), said despite financial challenges, he believed local authorities could still make a difference.
"Success is achieved by reaching out and acting positively rather than retreating to an island of negativity," he said.
"I am optimistic about the future and am hopeful that Gwynedd will remain at the heart of building the new Wales."
