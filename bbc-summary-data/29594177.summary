Knowsley Council chief executive Sheena Ramsey quits to 'save money'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Knowsley Council's chief executive is stepping down as part of a move to find £26m savings which will also see 200 jobs lost over the next two years.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Sheena Ramsey is to take voluntary redundancy at the end of the month.
A management restructure will also result in the loss of "several senior manager posts" to "realise more savings", the authority said.
The council said the review had only just started and that it could not say how many senior roles would be axed.
In a statement, Knowsley Council said: "One of the ways in which we plan to achieve savings is by further reducing our senior management costs.
"In view of this, Sheena Ramsey has decided to step down from her role as chief executive and take voluntary redundancy.
"We will also be looking to restructure our senior management arrangements resulting in a loss of several senior manager posts to realise more savings, as well as reducing our workforce by 200 jobs."
Ms Ramsey, who earns a salary of between £175,000 and £192,000, has worked at the authority for nine years.
