King: Mswati III
King Mswati III was crowned in 1986 at the age of 18, succeeding his long-serving father King Sobhuza II, who died at the age of 82.
The king, who is known as Ngweyama - "the lion" - often appears in public in traditional dress and has many wives.
He rules by decree and has been criticised for the heavy-handed treatment of opponents and for requesting public money to pay for new palaces and luxury cars.
Protesters angered by economic decline have become increasingly vocal in demanding political reform.
In 2014, the government of King Mswati III further restrained an already weakened media environment in Swaziland, and both journalists and media outlets were targeted by officials through the use of restrictive legislation, Freedom House reported in 2015.
The government does not restrict access to the internet, but few Swazis can afford to go online, according to Freedom House.
