[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The move is expected to lead to a double by-election in Leith Walk ward, which she has represented for the past eight years.
The councillor for Leith Walk wants to focus on winning a Green seat in the North East of Scotland in the 2016 Scottish Parliament elections.
Ms Chapman is co-convener of the Scottish Green Party.
She is also rector of Aberdeen University, and will be moving to Dundee.
Ms Chapman said: "It has been a huge honour and privilege to serve and work with the people of Leith Walk for the last eight years.
"I am proud of my successes in introducing 'Leith Decides', opening up council decision-making as chair of the petitions committee, and being the first politician in Scotland to call for the introduction of a Living Wage.
"I am confident that voters in Leith Walk will respond positively to our campaign to elect a successor Green councillor to continue that hard work."
Steve Burgess, convenor of  Edinburgh city council's Green group, said: "I thank Maggie for her work as a Green councillor over the last eight years.
"We will campaign hard to ensure a new Green councillor is elected at the by-election, on a promise that only the Greens can offer a progressive and constructive opposition to the current Labour-SNP administration at the City Chambers.
