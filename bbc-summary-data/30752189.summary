Manuel Pellegrini: Man City boss says referees in England are 'good'

Manchester City boss Manuel Pellegrini says refereeing standards in England are "good", despite criticism from former officials and other managers.

Former referees' boss Keith Hackett said officiating in the Premier League was "bordering on appalling" over Christmas, but Pellegrini disagreed.
"No-one can win or lose the title on one refereeing decision," he said.
"Maybe they can lose one game but in another they can give you a penalty or a foul that is not a foul."
Chilean Pellegrini has managed Villarreal, Real Madrid and Malaga in Spain as well as several South American clubs.
"They can all make mistakes but it is very difficult to decide what happened in one second," he added.
"By repeating on TV in five or six angles, it is more easy to demonstrate what has happened. I think referees in England are good. I don't have any complaints."
Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho has been charged by the Football Association for claiming there is a "campaign" to influence referees' decisions against his side, while West Ham's Sam Allardyce and Swansea's Garry Monk have also spoken out against officials.
Hackett, who headed the Professional Game Match Officials Limited (PGMOL) until 2010, criticised Andre Marriner's "pretty poor performance" in the game between City and Everton in December.
City's match-winning penalty was questioned, whilst a bad challenge on Sergio Aguero by Seamus Coleman went unpunished.
Former Fifa referee Hackett claimed he counted "over 20 major errors" during the Christmas period and named five current top-flight referees who he felt should be demoted at the end of the season.
Meanwhile, Pellegrini says he is happy to remain at City, despite being linked with a return to Spain as part of an overhaul at Barcelona.
"I am very happy," he said. "I have a contract for this year and one more. I hope I will continue."
Pellegrini, who has been linked with Swansea's Wilfried Bony, confirmed he is looking to sign an additional striker during the present transfer window.
