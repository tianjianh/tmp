[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A driver has admitted causing the death of another motorist on the M8 in West Lothian.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Alexander Cassidy crashed into Wayne Strickland's car near Livingston in July last year.
Cassidy, 29, from Kilmarnock, East Ayrshire, faced a charge of causing death by dangerous driving.
His guilty plea to a reduced allegation of causing the incident due to driving without due care and attention, was rejected by the Crown.
A trial date was set for March next year.
It is alleged Cassidy drove a van dangerously and at "excessive speed" for the conditions on the westbound M8 on 20 July last year.
He is accused of not observing slow or stationary traffic before hitting the back of Mr Strickland's vehicle.
This is said to have caused Mr Strickland's car to strike a third vehicle which went into the back of a lorry.
The indictment states that Mr Strickland, a 49-year-old father, from Inverkeithing, Fife, was so severely injured that he died.
He was a business advisor with West Lothian Council at the time of his death.
Cassidy is due to stand trial on 14 March in Livingston. The case could last up to five days.
