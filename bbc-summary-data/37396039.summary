The Metropolitan Police has said it is investigating footage released on social media of an incident appearing to show an officer attacking a car.

The video claims to show a Met officer smashing the windscreen after the driver refuses to get out of the vehicle.
The incident took place in Camden, north London, at 17:00 BST on Friday.
The Met said the Directorate of Professional Standards (DPS) has launched an investigation.
It added that "as this matter is in its early stages, the officers have not been suspended or placed on restricted duties".
It is not known what led up to the incident and no one was arrested.
The video, which has not been independently verified, shows a police officer pulling at a partially-opened driver's side window, repeatedly telling the driver "get out of the car".
He orders the driver to get out of the car one more time before saying "you're not allowed to drive yet."
When the driver continues to refuse to leave the vehicle the officer then begins to hit the driver's side window with what appears to be a baton.
Meanwhile, a voice from inside the car can be heard saying: "I've got a licence. I've got a licence. I've got insurance. You're smashing this for no reason."
The officer can then be seen striking the windscreen, shattering the glass.
He then begins to start slicing around the damaged area with what looks like a cutting tool.
When asked by the driver what the problem is, the officer tells him he is "not allowed to drive".
A man who identified himself as Leon said he was the driver and the person who filmed the footage.
He told the Press Association the incident was just a case of "mistaken identity", but that it was "complete madness" and he is "still in shock".
Leon, who said he spent the evening in hospital due to getting glass in his eyes, added: "Every time he smashed the glass, fragments of glass were just ricocheting in my face."
The Metropolitan Police Service (MPS) is aware of footage circulating on social media of an incident involving two uniformed officers in Camden.
The incident took place at Weedington Road, NW5, at around 17:00 hours on Friday, 16 September.
The footage will now be subject to an investigation by officers from the Directorate of Professional Standards (DPS).
As soon as the MPS was made aware of the footage, the DPS was contacted immediately.
The individual who uploaded the footage has been contacted by DPS officers.
As this matter is in its early stages, the officers have not been suspended or placed on restricted duties. No one was arrested during the incident.
