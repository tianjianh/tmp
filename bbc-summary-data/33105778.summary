Calls to publish Navitus Bay report from MP

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A government examination of plans for a £3.5bn offshore wind farm should be published, an MP has said.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Planning Inspectorate has now made its recommendation on the Navitus Bay project off Dorset, Hampshire and the Isle of Wight to the government.
However, the details given to Energy Secretary Amber Rudd do not have to be revealed for up to three months.
Conor Burns, the Conservative MP for Bournemouth West has called for greater transparency.
Speaking in the House of Commons, Mr Burns called for time to be made for a debate on the appropriateness of the decision being withheld until publication by government in September.
Last month, the firm behind the planned project revealed it had decided to use fewer, higher more powerful turbines.
Its Navitus Bay plan A, costing £3.5bn, would see 121 8MW turbines each 200m (656ft) high, instead of a maximum of 194 less powerful options.
All local councils, except the Isle of Wight Council, are against the scheme which campaigners fear will hit tourism.
Navitus Bay said the project would boost the area's economy by £1.6bn and would create about 1,700 jobs during the four years it takes to build and 140 local permanent jobs.
If it goes ahead, the farm could generate enough power for up to 700,000 homes, the firm said.
