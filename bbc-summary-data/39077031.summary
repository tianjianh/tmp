[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
England batsman Nick Compton has extended his contract with county champions Middlesex.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 33-year-old, who is in his second spell with the club, will remain at Lord's until the end of 2018.
Compton took a six-week break from the game last summer after a disappointing Test series against Sri Lanka.
"Nick had a difficult season in 2016, but he remains a high-quality player," managing director of cricket Angus Fraser said.
"He is fit and still has an extremely strong desire to score runs, and to contribute to the success of Middlesex."
Right-hander Compton scored just 51 runs in five innings against Sri Lanka, and has not added to his 16 Test caps since that series ended.
The former Somerset player scored 436 runs at an average of 27.27 in 10 outings in the County Championship last year as Middlesex won the Division One title for the first time since 1993.
He has scored 6,278 runs in 174 appearances for the club in all formats of the game.
Meanwhile, Middlesex all-rounder Toby Roland-Jones has been added to the South squad for the first North v South one-day series in Dubai and Abu Dhabi next month.
The 29-year-old replaces Kent's Matt Coles, who suffered a toe injury during the Spitfires' recent trip to Antigua to play in the West Indies domestic 50-over competition.
