Sussex all-rounder Ollie Robinson has signed a new three-year contract, which will keep him at the club until the end of the 2018 season.

The 21-year-old scored a century on his debut for the club in April and took 63 wickets in all competitions in 2015.
"Ollie made a fantastic impact, impressing everybody with his control as a bowler and potential as a batter," Sussex boss Mark Robinson said.
"There is a lot more to come. We look forward to watching Ollie develop."
Right-armer Robinson moved to Hove this year on a short-term deal after being sacked by Yorkshire in 2014.
His ton against Durham made him the first debutant Sussex centurion in the County Championship since Kenneth Higgs in 1920, and his 10th-wicket stand of 164 with Matt Hobden in the same innings broke a 107-year-old club record.
Robinson took career-best figures of 6-33 against Warwickshire in May and finished the Championship season with 46 wickets at an average of 24.71.
"I'm very much looking forward to what my future with Sussex has to hold," he said.
"With the young, up and coming squad that we have working together it is, and will continue to be, a great time to be at the club."
