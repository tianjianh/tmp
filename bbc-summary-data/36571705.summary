William Buick: Jockey banned for a month after French Oaks at Chantilly

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Jockey William Buick has been banned for four weeks by stewards after an incident in the French Oaks won by La Cressonniere.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Buick, on Highlands Queen, was adjudged to have caused the fall of Pierre-Charles Boudet's mount Armande.
He was subsequently disqualified from his ninth-placed finish and put last.
Stewards banned Godolphin jockey Buick for the automatic 15 days for causing the fall and an extra 15 days for being offensive to the officials.
Boudet and Armande were not thought to be seriously injured.
Buick, 27, has said he will appeal against the original 15-day suspension, which is due to begin on 3 July.
If he is unsuccessful in his appeal he will miss meetings including the Irish Oaks, Newmarket's July meeting, the King George VI And Queen Elizabeth Stakes at Ascot and Glorious Goodwood.
La Cressonniere, ridden by Cristian Demuro, completed a Classic double for trainer Jean-Claude Rouget as she followed up her French 1,000 Guineas victory in a rough contest with plenty of bumping.
Ballydoyle, ridden by Ryan Moore, suffered a bump early on and could not recover to challenge, finishing sixth behind Aidan O'Brien stablemate Coolmore.
It was a fifth win from five races for the 11-4 favourite La Cressonniere, with Left Hand second and Volta third.
Earlier in June, Rouget won the French Derby with Almanzor and he landed Royal Ascot's Coronation Stakes on Friday with Qemah.
