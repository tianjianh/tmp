Bardsey Island Trust advertises 'perfect summer job'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A remote island off the coast of north west Wales is advertising the "perfect summer job".

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Bardsey Island Trust is looking for a new information and volunteer officer to spend 18 weeks living in the tiny community.
The job offers basic accommodation and the chance to work in a national nature reserve, home to dolphins and seals.
The island, located two miles off Llyn peninsula, is only accessible by private boat.
But Caroline Williams, administrator with the Bardsey Island Trust, warned the job is not a holiday.
"It's lonely and isolated, and you have to be prepared for that," she said. "But the people who live there love it.
"And it's not totally cut off - there is the internet and phone. It is the perfect job for someone who is at university or who has just graduated and is looking for some experience."
The island, called Ynys Enlli in Welsh, is limited to around 2,000 visitors per season, and has seven permanent residents.
It is said to be the burial ground of 20,000 saints, and was an important pilgrimage post for early Christians.
Last year the Trust was inundated with hundreds of applications from as afar afield as Pakistan after advertising for an island manager.
But Ms Williams strongly recommends that prospective applicants visit the windswept island.
Job responsibilities include pathways maintenance, updating the Trust's website and social media, and volunteer support - and applicants must be fluent in welsh and English.
The deadline for the job, part-funded by Natural Resources Wales, is 1 April, and the starting date is 1 June.
