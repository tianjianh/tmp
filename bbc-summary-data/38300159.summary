Dorset E. coli: Investigation fails to find source

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An investigation has failed to find the source of an outbreak of a rare strain of E. coli that left some children with lifelong kidney damage.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Ten children were among 31 people in Dorset to contract the O55 strain between July 2014 and November 2015.
The Public Health England investigation closed in March but some families said they had not been informed.
The parents of two affected children said they are "disappointed and frustrated" by the news.
The investigation also involved the Food Standards Agency and local authorities, but it now seems unlikely the source will ever be known.
Gabrielle Archer's son Isaac Mortlock was three when he contracted the bug. He suffered permanent kidney damage and may need a transplant.
Miss Archer, from Bournemouth, said: "He has to be fed through a tube. He's now five-and-a-half, has only just started school full-time and has regressed to wearing nappies,"
"He will not lead the life he would have lived."
She said she felt her family had been treated "appallingly" during the investigation, mainly due to a lack of communication.
"We have never had official information, in writing, to say the investigation had closed. We just assumed it had because after two years we are still waiting for it to be resolved," she said.
"You can't just learn to live with this - there's no closure, it's so frustrating."
Another parent, Neil Fincham-Dukes, is from Bath but visited Dorset, where the cases were centred.
He said: "I'm disappointed Public Health England hasn't spoken to us about it given the severity of the incident - it's very frustrating."
His son Joseph suffered kidney failure when he was three and his daughter Poppy, who was one at the time, also became ill with the infection.
Although Poppy made a full recovery, Joseph has long-term kidney complications.
Public Health England [PHE] has not yet responded to the comments by Miss Archer and Mr Fincham-Dukes.
However, it did describe the investigation as "extensive" and added control measures had included "extended screening and exclusion of cases and high risk contacts".
Dr Sarah Harrison, from PHE South West, said there had been no further cases of the infection since November 2015, but added the agency remained "vigilant".
She said work on a new test - using microscopic magnetic beads to investigate the source of future outbreaks of the strain - is due for completion in early 2017.
The test is being developed by the Animal Plant and Health Agency, which could also use it to look at the incidence and prevalence of E. coli O55 in animals.
PHE had said the O55 strain had never before been recorded in England.
