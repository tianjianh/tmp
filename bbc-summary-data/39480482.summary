When the Sub Club opened in April in 1987 it struggled to take off.

DJ Harri - who has been at the Glasgow club since its inception - said there were concerns it would have to close.
Speaking on BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland programme, he said: "We thought: 'They're going to get shot of us'."
But its fortunes changed in 1990 when the Stone Roses played in Glasgow Green and held their after-show party at the venue.
"From then on we had four years of being mobbed every week," he said.
Based in Jamaica Street and nestled between the River Clyde and Glasgow Central Station, the club now regularly features in lists of the world's best night clubs.
On 1 April, it celebrated its 30th anniversary, attracting regulars and new clientele alike.
One clubber said he came simply because he "researched on Google the best clubs in Glasgow and Sub Club was on the top".
A club regular said "the originality of the music" had kept her coming since 2002.
Another said: "I've been coming here for years and years and I met my partner in the Sub Club, so it's a really special place for us."
Owner Mike Grieve said the club's appeal was down to its focus on good music, new ideas and not following fashions.
"It still has the same kind of feel, the same audience, the same demographic - it's just moved on 30 years," he said.
Former NME editor Stuart Cosgrove has regularly been to the basement club since the 1980s.
"It's the club that has done the most across Europe to bring dance music to prominence," he said.
"Over the years it has been a pioneer for hip hop, the Chicago sound, for underground New York dance music and for Detroit techno.
"It's been the place where some of the world's greatest DJs have found their most energetic crowds."
