Festival-goers are being invited to have a go on what is claimed to be the world's largest bouncy castle.

The organisers of Common People commissioned the inflatable structure for the event on Southampton Common on Saturday and Sunday.
The castle, measuring 23.8m by 20.7m by 12.8m, is taller than the Great Wall of China and can be used by 100 people.
It will also appear at the organisers' other festivals - Bestival on the Isle of Wight and Camp Bestival in Dorset.
Festival organiser Rob da Bank said: "We do love breaking a record and this is one of our funnest builds so far."
There is currently no record for the world's biggest bouncy castle.
Guinness World Records is yet to verify the record.
Common People, now in its second year, features Duran Duran, Primal Scream, Craig David and Public Enemy.
For the first time, a simultaneous event is also being held in South Parks, Oxford.
The current record for a bouncy castle was set in 1997 by Dana Caspersen and William Forsythe, the festival said.
The castle, measuring 19m by 19m by 12m, took six hours to erect at the Roundhouse in Camden, north London.
