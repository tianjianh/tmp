Barkley, 23, who has been linked with a move to Tottenham, missed the club's pre-season tour to Tanzania and Netherlands with the injury.
The England international, who has one year left on his contract, is expected to return in four weeks.
Everton defender Ramiro Funes Mori will miss between six and nine months after having another knee operation.
The 26-year-old suffered a torn meniscus while playing for Argentina in March, which ruled him out of the rest of the 2016-17 season.
"Ramiro Funes Mori has undergone further surgery in Barcelona which will require prolonged rehabilitation of a minimum of six to nine months," the club said on their website.
Meanwhile, Aaron Lennon scored on his return to the first team, two months after he was detained by police under the Mental Health Act because of concerns for his welfare.
Kevin Mirallas and Kieran Dowell also scored in a 3-0 pre-season friendly win over Dutch side FC Twente in De Lutte on Wednesday.
