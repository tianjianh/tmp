GB failed to progress from their pool at this year's Olympics in Rio.
Crutchley, 46, conceded it had been a "difficult few months", but is now targeting medals at the 2018 World Cup in India and the 2020 Olympics.
"The start of a new cycle is a chance to freshen things up. We get a chance to start with a new focus," he said.
"We are ultimately in the business of winning hockey matches and tournaments and we're excited to get going and to do that."
Crutchley, who won 80 England caps as a player, has been in charge since 2013.
