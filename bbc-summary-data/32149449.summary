After a 500th career win we remember Murray's best wins

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Andy Murray has joined one of tennis's most exclusive clubs after notching up the 500th match win of his career.

No other Brit has managed that many, and only 45 other players from around the world have passed the landmark since Open tennis began in 1968.
There are eight other currently active players who have passed 500 wins too, with Roger Federer topping the pile on 1,012 wins.
But which of Andy's 500 victories have been the most significant?
The 18-year-old Scot had already proved he knew his way round a grass-court by reaching the third round at Queen's where he came up against the 2002 Australian Open champion Thomas Johansson. Murray split the first two sets with the Swede on two tie-breaks, and it was nip and tuck in the decider when the Scot's physical condition deteriorated. He struggled with cramp, appeared to faint at one point and could barely run by the end of the match. Johansson came through 7-6 6-7 7-5 but Murray proved he could mix it with the world's best, although his weak physical condition was a concern.
By now Murray was hovering around the top 10 in the world but was yet to make a breakthrough in a Grand Slam. In the fourth round that year, Murray came up against the flashy Frenchman Richard Gasquet, who stormed into a two-set lead. Murray showed impressive steel and determination however to drag himself back into contention in front of an increasingly hysterical centre court crowd. Murray's physical condition was much improved and when he secured victory in the fifth set, he turned to his box and flexed his bicep, highlighting the work he'd put in off court to toughen himself up.
The Spaniard had thrashed the Scot in the last eight of Wimbledon a couple of months previously, but when they met again in the last four in New York, Murray was tougher both physically and mentally. It was his first appearance in a Grand Slam semi-final and he took the fight to the then world number one, even winning the physical battle with a player renowned for his strength and powers of recovery. Murray went through to the final in four sets, where he was dismantled by Roger Federer in three. Not the result he wanted, but it was further proof that here was a Grand Slam champion in waiting.
Murray was still waiting for that maiden major triumph after three previous final defeats, and anticipation was rightly high after he booked his spot in the Wimbledon final. On the other side of the net was arguably the greatest player of all time, particularly on a grass-court, Roger Federer. The Swiss is immensely popular wherever he plays, not least on centre court which is why the crowd's affection appeared to be evenly split. Federer impressed on the way to a four-set win, but it was during the presentation ceremony that Murray really left his mark. The Scot gave a tearful speech which endeared him to millions and released some of the pressure and tension he had been carrying on his shoulders.
Just a matter of weeks after his Wimbledon final defeat, Murray had the chance for revenge against the Swiss on the same court in the Olympic final. On this occasion there was no doubt where the crowd's loyalties lay; Murray swept to victory on the back of a vocal and euphoric wave of British Olympic fever. He handed the Swiss one of his most humbling defeats in a final, securing the gold medal with an ace. It may not have been a major, but it was his biggest title to date and it proved he was getting closer to that all important first Grand Slam crown.
Murray was the form player of the summer after that Wimbledon final and his gold medal triumph. However, he had suffered defeat in all his four Grand Slam finals to date. On this occasion it was the defending champion Novak Djokovic on the other side of the next. Murray made a strong start, taking the first two sets before being pegged back by the dogged Serb. At the start of the fifth Murray took a bathroom break when he looked in the mirror and promised himself he would do whatever it took to get over the line. He then dug deep to become Britain's first Grand Slam winner in 76 years by posting a 7-6 7-5 2-6 3-6 6-2  triumph in an epic four hours and 54 minutes in the Arthur Ashe Stadium.
Murray had got the Grand Slam duck off his back, but the one everyone really wanted to see him win was Wimbledon. Unlike 12 months previously there was no doubt where the loyalty of the crowd lay, with Murray roared out as he stepped onto a blisteringly hot centre court. The atmosphere resembled the Olympic final of the previous year and Murray repaid his support by producing the most accomplished performance in a major final of his career. The Scot stormed into a two-set lead and served for the match at 5-4 in the third. What followed was a nerve shredding final game where break points came and went, before Murray eventually sealed the win at his fourth attempt, ending a 77-year wait for a British men's singles champion at Wimbledon.
