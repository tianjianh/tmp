Smoking ban for Edinburgh city council play parks

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Smoking will no longer be allowed in council play parks, car parks and courtyards in Edinburgh.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The new Smoke Free Policy replaces the City of Edinburgh Council's control of smoking at work policy.
Under the policy, smoking restrictions have been extended from the workplace and vehicles to surrounding areas for council properties.
The new rules - which include e-cigarettes - mean the ban now includes entrances, car parks and play areas.
Andrew Burns, Edinburgh city council's leader, said: "It is well known that smoking is one of the biggest causes of ill health in Scotland.
"As a local authority, we recognise our role in helping to achieve Scotland's smoke-free ambitions set out by the Scottish government.
"The updated policy takes into account the effect passive smoking has on non-smokers, in particular children, who have no choice when it comes to protection from others' tobacco smoke."
