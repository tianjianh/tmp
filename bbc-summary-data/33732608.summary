A music festival that began as an "overspilled house party" is marking its tenth anniversary after growing into an award-winning annual event.

Y Not Festival originally hosted local bands but now attracts big acts including this year's headliners Snoop Dogg, Primal Scream and Basement Jaxx.
Founder Ralph Broadbent originally planned to hold a party in his parents' Derbyshire garden while they were away.
The party was moved to a disused quarry when his parents stayed at home.
It was called Big Gin Fest - a play on its location near Biggin in the Peak District - and attracted about 120 people when it was held over two days in 2005.
Mr Broadbent said: "That was the first beginnings of it, next year we got a licence, we grew it and invited the public and it sort of doubled every year, now we've sort of got to 15,000 people."
The name changed to Y Not Festival in 2006, although it was held in the same quarry.
Mr Broadbent was still a teenager when the festival started and ran it alongside studying at university for four years, graduating from his engineering course in 2011.
The festival is now held in the village of Pikehall and is run by the same small team.
Accolades include Best Small Festival in the 2012 UK Festival Awards.
Dean Jackson, presenter of radio programme The Beat, said Y Not is an important springboard for local talent.
"The track record is something quite spectacular," he said.
"Jake Bugg played here the day before he signed, Saint Raymond the day before he signed, Indiana, the list goes on and on, so we are hopeful that the artists playing here this weekend will go on to great things too."
