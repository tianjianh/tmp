Raheem Sterling: 'Tired' teenager defended by Rio Ferdinand

Former England captain Rio Ferdinand has defended Raheem Sterling's request to "sit out" England's 1-0 win over Estonia on Sunday because of fatigue.

Sterling was used as a substitute in the Euro 2016 Group E qualifier after telling boss Roy Hodgson he was tired.
Ferdinand said more English players should follow the 19-year-old's lead as it would benefit the national team.
He said on Twitter: "Fair play to him. English players are normally too proud to do that unlike our foreign friends."
Sterling came on as a 64th-minute substitute in Tallinn and was fouled for the free-kick that captain Wayne Rooney scored from.
The teenager, who has played 1,079 minutes of football this season, responded to criticisms from fans by tweeting: "Excuse me for being human. On my way home."
Last month Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers had promised to protect the teenager in a bid to avoid the experiences of Michael Owen, whose career stuttered from his mid-twenties onwards because of injury.
Like Owen, who made the England 1998 World Cup squad aged 18, Sterling has become a key player for both his club and country at a young age.
Ferdinand said he and other England players, like Rooney and Steven Gerrard, would have benefited from more rest and pointed to his former Manchester United team-mate Carolos Tevez, who would not take part in training when tired.
The former defender added on Twitter: "Tevez would come in some days and sit on the massage bed while the team trained. "I'm tired"... match day - firing and energised.
"With more rest at the right times throughout seasons, Rooney would have gone into tournaments for England fresher 100%. Too proud again.
"Same could be said of Gerrard, [Frank] Lampard, John Terry, Ashley Cole myself etc - all too proud to sit out of training or a match with the bigger picture in mind.
"Going by many of the responses on here - because players earn a fortune they cannot get tired. Leave off!"
Former England rugby union captain Will Carling also sympathised with Sterling.
"Always amazed how simplistic some people are," Carling tweeted. "Professional sportspeople can never get tired/ lose form. They get paid! They're still human!!
"I am not just talking footy. Sometimes the adrenaline is just not there. The extra edge. Down to opposition, or fatigue."
