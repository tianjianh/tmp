Last year's winner Ronnie O'Sullivan has decided not to defend his title, but with top-ranked Mark Selby in the draw, there is no shortage of pedigree.
BBC television coverage begins on Saturday, 28 November as BBC Two and BBC Red Button broadcast live from the Barbican Centre.
Online viewers will also be able to choose from live streams of both tables from the second round onwards, and there will be BBC Two highlights and reaction in our 'Extra' programme for those who miss the day's play.
All times GMT. Fixtures and event start times are subject to change. The BBC is not responsible for any changes that may be made. Also, coverage on BBC Red Button can be subject to late schedule changes, so details may differ from this page. National and regional variations have been included where possible.
