[SN]TITLE[SN]
Northern Ireland schools absence levels 'disturbing'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Northern Ireland Audit office has said it is disturbed at the high level of pupils who miss weeks of schooling.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The situation has improved a little in the 10 years since the auditor last investigated, but he said there were still challenges to be faced.
Out of 300,000 school children in NI, 20,000 are missing at least six weeks of lessons each year.
The level of unauthorised absences is now proportionately twice as high as in England.
"Our attendance policy is living and vibrant. We talk about great initiatives for getting children into school.
At Holy Cross Boys' School, we have a breakfast club. When the children come in, they can join the i-pad club, the book club or the chess club.
These children come in their droves because they want to be part of what we have to offer.
We have had many challenges over the years. We are in a highly socially deprived area, at the minute we have 78% free school meals.
Despite all that, we do send 42% children to grammar school.
We have a rigorous, robust but very fair attendance policy.
We talk about an early intervention programme. If I have a problem with attendances, I will speak to the parents.
Sometimes, I've been at homes and I've been taking children out of bed and into school. I am known as the headmaster who gets the children out of bed and into school.
We would offer great rewards for getting children into school.  We make it competitive and fun.
With children who have 100% attendance in a month, they are put into a draw for Â£5. That is some incentive to come in.
Kevin McArevey                 Principal, Holy Cross Boys' PS Commended for good practice in the Audit Office Report
Alarm bells should ring where a pupil misses around six weeks of schooling, but the auditor is concerned that schools are not being encouraged to report all cases.
Of the 20,000 pupils who are persistently absent, less than a fifth were referred to the authorities.
Non-attendance is said to not only waste money, it also affects a child's long-term prospects.
Persistent offenders are seven times more likely to be out of a job and not in education or training when they leave school.
Children in socially deprived areas and in traveller families are most likely to be affected.
Auditor General Kieran Donnelly said the cost to society, in terms of lost career opportunities, amounted to Â£22m a year.
The audit office published its last report on school absenteeism in 2004.
Ten years later it said there had been a marginal improvement.
The Department of Education has been praised for  improving the way information is collected and commissioning research, but the report said there was not enough joined-up thinking among the education and library boards.
