Scott Jamieson is planning a move back to the United States but the Scottish golfer will not be saying goodbye to the European Tour.

The 31-year-old's American wife, Natalie, is expecting their second child in November and the couple are considering moving their home base.
"But nothing will change golf-wise," Jamieson told BBC Scotland.
"In an ideal world, I would play more over there, but my current world ranking doesn't give me access."
Jamieson honed his golfing skills while on a sports scholarship in Augusta, Georgia, when he was a teenager.
But the Glaswegian returned to Scotland before turning professional 10 years ago.
"I was 17 when I went, but it was definitely the most important thing I ever did," said Jamieson.
"I never had one moment where I looked back and thought 'I wish I had stayed at home' because all of a sudden you are out playing championship-style golf courses and competing against the best of your age across the whole of the United States.
"My wife's actually American, so she's quite keen on living there. It's something we're actually looking at.
"We've got a young daughter and we've got a second child coming at the end of the year, so we're considering maybe starting up over there."
However, joining compatriots Russell Knox and Martin Laird and playing regularly on the US PGA tour would require a move up the world rankings from his present 576 into the top 100.
"It would be great to be in their position," admitted Jamieson, whose priority at the moment is to qualify for this summer's Open Championship at Royal Troon.
"As it stands, I still have three opportunities to get my tee time," he added.
"The first one is going to be a week on Tuesday when they have the final qualifying, which is held at Glasgow Gailes, and then they also have spots available at the French Open the following week and also at the Scottish Open.
"I have managed to sneak in at the final opportunity twice before and also through the qualifying once before."
