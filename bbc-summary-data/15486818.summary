Horizon Nuclear Power (HNP) secured the purchase of the land near the proposed Wylfa B site at auction in 2009.
The transaction was subject to a number of conditions which its says have now been resolved.
"Taking title to the land is one of the key steps required for us to be able to develop a new power station on the Wylfa site," said HNP.
As a result of the completion of the purchase, land within the government boundary for permanent nuclear buildings transfers into Horizon's ownership from the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority and energy firm EdF.
Alan Raymant, HNP chief operating officer, said the purchase marked a milestone in Horizon's development of new nuclear power station at Wylfa.
"The UK government designated the National Policy Statement on nuclear energy earlier in the year and this has cleared the way to completing the agreement," he explained.
The completion also means work can start on the appearance of some of the properties on the site, said HNP.
Alan Smith, HNP head of site development, said: "We'll now put a programme in place to deal with empty boarded-up properties, which we know some local people have had concerns about."
Mr Smith said the firm needed to make sure it properly managed any wildlife issues, such as relocating roosting bats, but he expected some of the buildings to be taken down in the near future.
"We'll make sure local people are kept informed in advance of any works," he added.
Horizon is bringing forward plans to develop up to 3.3 GW (gigawatt) of new nuclear capacity at Wylfa, with the first unit scheduled to come online around 2020.
The UK government confirmed in June a list of eight sites it deemed suitable for new power stations by 2025, including the site for Wylfa B.
