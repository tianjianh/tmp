Former Lincolnshire academy bosses deny 'greedy' abuse of funds

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A former employee of a Lincolnshire academy group ran up bills on school credit cards in a "greedy" abuse of power, a trial has heard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Former Priory Federation chief executive Richard Gilliland, 63, and its ex-finance director Stephen Davies, 57, deny fraud charges.
Lincoln Crown Court was told Mr Gilliland bought hundreds of items online, including videos and condoms.
He is also accused of suppressing his son's criminal record to get him a job.
The Priory Federation runs four schools in Lincoln and Grantham.
Prosecutor David Allan said "greed" led both men to abuse their positions instead of protecting the financial interests of the Priory Federation.
Lincoln Crown Court heard Mr Gilliland allegedly employed his son Kia Richardson at a Priory premises even though he had criminal convictions for possessing heroin and indecency.
Mr Allan said Mr Gilliland's son was "highly unsuitable to be working around children" because of his background.
The court was told Mr Davies assisted by arranging payments for courses for Mr Richardson, but he has claimed he was "bullied" by Mr Gilliland.
Mr Gilliland denies six charges of fraud by abuse of position and Mr Davies three.
The alleged offences are said to have happened on various dates between 1 October 2008 and 30 November 2011.
The case continues.
