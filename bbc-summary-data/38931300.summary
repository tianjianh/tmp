The home of the Edinburgh International Book Festival is looking to spill out on to George Street in a bid to capture new audiences.

The festival, which has been running for more than 30 years, is currently based in the capital's Charlotte Square.
It comes after the owners asked the festival to reduce its impact on the space.
Officials are also looking at ways to minimise damaging the grass.
Nick Barley, director of Edinburgh International Book Festival, said: "We have been working closely with the proprietors of Charlotte Square Gardens who generously make this private space available for the Book Festival each year, but who have now asked us to reduce our impact on the gardens.
"This year, we are looking at ways of improving our infrastructure to ensure a quicker get-in and get-out to minimise damage to the turf and soil.
"We also intend to take advantage of the opportunities of new technology, digital innovation and development of temporary theatre structures and for the 2017 festival are in discussion with the City of Edinburgh Council and Essential Edinburgh to look to expand into new spaces on George Street which will open up the Book Festival to new audiences."
