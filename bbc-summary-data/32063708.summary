Berkshire street lights replaced in £27m LED project

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Street lights in Reading, Wokingham and Slough are to be modernised in a £27m scheme.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The work will see streetlamps, the lights on road signs and illuminated bollards replaced with LEDs.
Reading council said the scheme was expected to halve electricity bills and save on maintenance costs because the lights last longer.
A £19.3m grant from the government's Highways Challenge Fund has been used to help finance the project.
