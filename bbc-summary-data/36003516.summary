Joe Pigott's double kept Luton's slim League Two play-off chances alive with victory over second-placed Oxford.

The hosts took the lead at the Kassam Stadium as Danny Hylton netted from Kemar Roofe's pass.
A slip by U's keeper Benji Buchel allowed Pigott to equalise before Olly Lee's volley put the visitors ahead.
Oxford drew level when centre-half Chey Dunkley headed in Chris Maguire's free-kick but Pigott's tidy finish just gave Luton all three points.
A first loss in six for the home side handed Northampton Town the League Two title, while Luton are six points adrift of seventh-placed Wimbledon - who have a game in hand - with four matches left to play.
Luton Town manager Nathan Jones told BBC 3CR:

"We want to be in the position that Oxford are in next year in terms of the football they are playing and the way the club is set up.
"That being said I thought we were brilliant today and showed we can be like that.
"We can improve Luton town. Any player who comes in can improve the team, but we need to do our homework.
"Joe Piggott is one of those players that we researched, and although he has taken time to settle, he has shown what he can do today."
