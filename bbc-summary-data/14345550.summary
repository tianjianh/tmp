[SN]TITLE[SN]
Former councillor Tony Brunskill jailed for sex offences

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A former district councillor from Cumbria has been jailed for a string of sexual offences against young people.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Tony Brunskill had earlier admitted nine indecent assaults on a boy aged 13 or above, and seven counts of sexual activity with a child under 16.
Then before sentencing on Friday, he also pleaded guilty to three counts of indecent assault against a third boy.
The judge at Carlisle Crown Court sentenced the 66-year-old to a 10-year jail term.
He described Brunskill's behaviour as "disgusting" and said it had devastated the victims and their families.
The indecent assaults took place while he was working at a school in Lancashire in the 1970s.
The sexual activity charges, which also included meeting a child for the purpose of sexual grooming, related to a Cumbrian boy and took place between 2008 and 2010.
Brunskill, of Salkeld Dykes near Penrith, is a former chairman of Eden District Council.
Speaking after the case, Det Sgt Kurt Taylor, of Cumbria Police, said: "I would like to applaud the victims in this case for having the courage to come forward and tell us what this man did to them.
"We will never know why he abused his victims, or the true extent of his offending, as he chose not to explain himself when interviewed."
