Row over Gatwick Airport pilot medical centre closure

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The closure of a medical centre for commercial pilots at Gatwick Airport has been branded "corporate vandalism".

The Civil Aviation Authority's (CAA) centre was opened after the 1972 Staines plane crash was partly blamed on a pilot's heart condition.
Dr Michael Joy, the first consultant at the centre, said the closure was not in the interest of aviation safety.
The CAA said other independently run centres were available to pilots, including in the Gatwick area.
Dr Joy said: "I think this is corporate vandalism.
"The pool of expertise built up over a generation is going to be dispersed and that cannot be in the interest of aviation safety, and it cannot be in the interest of the pilots."
A CAA spokesman said: "It was felt that the CAA should not be both a service provider and regulator of medical services.
"All requirements relating to pilot and air traffic controllers' medical examinations and fitness standards are set at a European-wide level and these will remain unchanged regardless of who provides medical services."
In 1972 a British European Airways Flight BE548 crashed in a field shortly after takeoff, killing all 118 people on board - at the time one of the UK's worst air disasters.
One of the underlying causes of the crash was the captain's health, a public inquiry found.
Capt Stanley Key had a heart condition which had lead to a "lack of concentration and impaired judgement", the official report said.
The crash led to the setting up of what is now known as the CAA's Aeromedical Centre.
Mervyn Granshaw, a former pilot from Surrey said; "The whole process of aero-medicine has evolved over the 30 years that it's been a centre of excellence."
The centre is due to close on 29 February.
