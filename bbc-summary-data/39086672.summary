[SN]TITLE[SN]
Leicester City v Hull City

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Leicester caretaker manager Craig Shakespeare could name the same side that impressed against Liverpool.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Goalkeeper Kasper Schmeichel will play despite a minor ankle problem, so the only absentee is defender Molla Wague.
Sam Clucas and Lazar Markovic are available for Hull after suspension and injury respectively, while Harry Maguire could overcome a knee injury.
Dieumerci Mbokani is out for six weeks with a hamstring injury.
Evandro, Curtis Davies, Michael Dawson,  Ryan Mason and Markus Henriksen are still out.
John Motson: "I'm calling this the recovery match - Hull have turned a corner and Leicester may well have done. It is a question on Saturday of which side continues that improvement.
"If Leicester win again, there's a good chance caretaker manager Craig Shakespeare will be asked to continue in the role. He knows the players and got the best out of them against Liverpool by returning to the default settings that won the title: 4-4-2, with Jamie Vardy thriving on balls played in behind.
"Marco Silva has got Hull playing decent football and he now has a bit of choice in terms of team selection.
"Their lamentable away record is a monkey on their back though. Defeat would add to the pressure ahead of next week's home game against Swansea."
Leicester City caretaker manager Craig Shakespeare: "I've been asked just to take the next game and we will sit down again after that. I'm being kept informed and I'm quite comfortable with what I've been asked to do.
"I've enjoyed working with the players but results are the be-all and end-all and the focus is on Hull. We must put back-to-back wins together.
"I think it's for other people to decide what qualities I've got and whether they are the right qualities [to take permanent charge]."
Hull City head coach Marco Silva: "Leicester are a good team. It's impossible for us to forget what they did last season and if we pay attention during this season as well, against very good teams at home they play very well.
"Not only against Liverpool. I remember against (Manchester) City they did the same and for me it was no surprise.
"I saw a team with a big motivation during the last match and I expect the same against us."
I know I have not predicted a victory for Hull all season and I have been wrong about them a few times, obviously - so it is probably good news for Marco Silva's side that I don't think they are going to win on Saturday either.
