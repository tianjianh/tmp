Jones left St Helens for Exeter at the end of the 2015 season on a two-year deal, but opted to move to Greater Manchester with his pregnant partner.
The 22-year-old can play across the back-row or in the centres, and has made 97 appearances in the 13-man code.
"[He's a] fantastic addition to our squad," owner Marwan Koukash tweeted.
The England Knights international was a Grand Final winner during his time at Saints, helping Nathan Brown's side to the 2014 Super League title.
