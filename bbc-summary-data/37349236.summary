The clip has had more than 16 million views since it was uploaded on 3 September.
Midwife Lisa Marie Sanchez Oxenham filmed Audra Lynn as she gave birth in Orange County, California.
Lisa Marie said: "I believe the video has gone viral because it's such a beautiful moment, in an intimate, private and relaxed atmosphere.
"That is something we just don't associate with childbirth anymore and certainly don't see enough of."
