Arlene, a 15-year-old from Castlederg, County Tyrone, went missing 22 years ago after attending a school disco in County Donegal.
She was last seen in a car driven by the convicted child killer and rapist, Robert Howard.
The opening day of the inquest heard that Arlene was a "vulnerable" girl from a troubled background who had been sexually abused in her younger years.
Colletta Smith reports from the coroner's court in Belfast.
