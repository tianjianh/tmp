[SN]TITLE[SN]
British and Irish Lions announce 2017 New Zealand tour schedule

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The British and Irish Lions will play two Tests in Auckland on their 10-match tour of New Zealand in 2017.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Eden Park will host the first and third Tests, while Wellington's Westpac Stadium will stage the second Test.
The Lions - who have not won a series against the All Blacks since 1971 - will face all of their hosts' Super Rugby teams and New Zealand Maori.
The five-week trip will begin with a match against a provincial side in Whangarei on 3 June 2017.
The Lions have lost four successive Test series against New Zealand since John Dawes captained them to a 2-1 victory there 44 years ago.
That sequence includes a 3-0 whitewash under the direction of World Cup-winning England coach Sir Clive Woodward on their last visit 10 years ago.
But the Lions will head for New Zealand having ended a 16-year wait for a series victory with a 2-1 win in Australia in 2013.
The three-Test series starts in Auckland's 50,000-capacity Eden Park on 24 June.
The Lions and All Blacks will then meet at Wellington's 34,500-capacity Westpac Stadium seven days later before returning to Eden Park on 8 July.
Six games are scheduled before the first Test, including matches against Super Rugby teams the Blues, Crusaders, Highlanders and Chiefs.
All midweek fixtures will take place on a Tuesday apart from the match against the Blues, which takes place on Wednesday, 7 June.
