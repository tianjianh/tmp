The 65-year-old, who starred as charmer Vince in 80s sitcom Just Good Friends, will play King Rat in Dick Whittington at the Assembly Rooms.
Nicholas takes up the mantle from Neil Morrissey, who has appeared in Derby's pantomime for the past two years.
Joining him in the show will be former Big Breakfast and This Morning presenter Mike McLean.
Nicholas's 50-year career has seen him appear in film and stage roles including Tommy, Lisztomania and the lead role in Jesus Christ Superstar.
He also had two top 10 hits in 1976 with Grandma's Party and Dancing with the Captain.
More recently he took part in ITV reality programme Grease is The Word and has started a franchise of acting schools for young people.
He said: "I'm looking forward to coming to Derby and winding pantomime audiences up with my King Rat.
"It's great for me to play the villain as I've spent most of my career being cast as the good guy, although I promise I'll be good by the end of the story."
Dick Whittington and his Cat will run at the Assembly Rooms from 7 December to 8 January.
