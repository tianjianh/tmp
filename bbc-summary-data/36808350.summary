The Polish couple got lost on Bealach na Glaic Moire while trying to walk into Coruisk on Monday.
Skye Mountain Rescue Team got the pair to safety during a seven hour-long call-out.
The man had experience of walking and climbing in Poland, but his partner did not and took fright while on a scree slope. She said "yes" to his proposal.
Skye MRT said visibility was poor and the couple had been navigating using Google Maps, but did not have other navigational aids.
Fortunately, conditions were calm and the rescue team was able to hear the lost pair's blasts on a whistle.
They were helped off the hill cold, but otherwise unharmed by their ordeal.
