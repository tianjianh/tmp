A migrant has died after being electrocuted at the entrance to the Eurotunnel in Calais, French police have said.

The man, believed to be Syrian, died after being found on the roof of a freight train at the Channel Tunnel.
He is the 10th person to die in or near the tunnel while trying to reach Britain since late June.
In recent weeks new security measures introduced at the tunnel entrance have led to a fall in intrusion attempts.
Eurotunnel Le Shuttle's passenger service is operating with some timetable disruption and a waiting time of about 30 minutes in the terminal on its Dover to Calais route.
BBC Paris correspondent Hugh Schofield said the young man had got through the fences surrounding the terminal, and climbed onto one of the shuttles that carry lorries through the tunnel, where the authorities say he was electrocuted, presumably by overhead power lines.
Eurotunnel confirmed that a freight train was stopped at about 22:20 on Thursday because of the presence of migrants on the tracks.
When the train was searched, a number of migrants were found on board, with one unconscious and one injured, the company said in a statement. They were immediately taken into care by the emergency services.
The authorities later confirmed the death of one of the migrants.
"This sad incident shows once again that any attempt to travel illegally through the Channel Tunnel is fraught with danger," Eurotunnel said.
Hundreds of migrants are still camped in and near Calais in the hope of crossing the Channel, he said.
Eurotunnel has said that migrants are making about 150 attempts to get into the terminal each night, down from a high of about 2,000 earlier in the year.
