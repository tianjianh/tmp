[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Lorraine Ridout, 57, was last seen on Gabalfa Avenue on 31 January.
South Wales Police confirmed searches of properties at Heol Trelai, Ely and Aberporth Road, Gabalfa have now concluded.
"I do believe that the answer to her disappearance is somewhere within north Cardiff," said Det Ch Insp Mark O'Shea.
"We have undertaken extensive searches at both addresses in the hope that we find something which may help us establish what happened to Lorraine before she disappeared, whatever that could have been.
"But I can confirm we are no further along in finding out what happened to Lorraine.
"I want to find answers for her family so it is very important that anybody who has any information, however insignificant it may seem, contacts us if they have not before."
No arrests have been made as part of the investigation.
