[SN]TITLE[SN]
Port Vale 0-3 Sheffield United

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Already-promoted Sheffield United took a huge step towards securing the League One title as they ran out comfortable winners at Port Vale.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
First-half goals from Jay O'Shea and Leon Clarke sent the Blades on their way to victory before Matt Done added the third in stoppage time.
The Blades will be crowned champions should Bolton fail to win at Oldham on Saturday, but the result leaves Vale in the relegation zone and a point from safety.
The visitors got off to a flying start, scoring after two minutes when Chris Basham's pass found O'Shea, whose low shot beat Deniz Mehmet from a tight angle.
Basham was again the provider on the half-hour mark when his cross found Clarke, who rifled a splendid volley into the roof of the net from just inside the box.
Clarke almost had a second after 49 minutes when he raced clear after latching onto a poor back pass, but was denied by Mehmet.
Done rounded off a perfect day three minutes into stoppage time, slotting home from Kieron Freeman's low cross.
