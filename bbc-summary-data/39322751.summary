Officers were alerted to the find just south of Porth Neigwl (Hell's Mouth), near Abersoch on the Llyn Peninsula, at about 16:00 GMT on Sunday.
Police and members of the coastguard placed a 100m (330ft) cordon around the object.
The Ministry of Defence confirmed it was possibly some kind of ordnance.
Explosive experts are set to detonate the device on Monday morning to make it safe.
