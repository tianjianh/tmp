The man, who is yet to be formally identified, was found at a house on Weelsby Street, Grimsby, shortly before 05:00 GMT on Sunday.
The 50-year-old was taken to hospital but later died from his injuries.
The three men, aged 53, 42 and 24, were released on bail pending further inquiries.
Humberside Police said its investigation was continuing and the force expects to release the identity of the dead man later in the week once his family, who live overseas, have arrived back in the country.
