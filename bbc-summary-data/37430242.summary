A gift shop's newspaper advert that featured a golliwog character has been banned by the advertising watchdog.

Viv Endecott, owner of the Ginger Pop Shop in Corfe Castle, Dorset, which is dedicated to the works of Enid Blyton, published the advert to promote a tea towel with the logo "English freedom".
The Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) upheld two complaints, ruling it caused "serious or widespread offence".
Ms Endecott said she was "proud" of the tea towel.
On its website, the shop describes itself as "all about Enid Blyton and her era". Some of the children's author's books featured golliwogs, and her work has been criticised for being racist.
The ASA ruling followed two complaints about the advert published in the Purbeck Gazette in June.
The ASA said: "We considered that many people were likely to view the character as representing negative racial stereotypes."
It added that it also considered that the inclusion of the words "English Freedom" were likely to contribute to that offence, "because in combination with the image it could be read as a negative reference to immigration or race".
The authority said the advert should not appear again.
In a statement, Ms Endecott said the tea towel was meant to "stimulate debate" and the shop had been "buzzing" with interest in it.
"I believe in free speech and a multiculturalism that celebrates the best of all humanity.
"The 'good' golliwog was on the tea towel to represent how it has become impossible to discuss anything to do with race without being accused of racism.
"This is important, because when we couldn't talk about uncontrolled immigration, it paved the way for Brexit."
Ms Endecott said she would not repeat the advert.
