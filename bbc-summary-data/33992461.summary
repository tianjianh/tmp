[SN]TITLE[SN]
Stolen sign returned to University of Bath

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A sign stolen by a student has been returned anonymously more than a decade after it was taken.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The University of Bath's "Derhill Terrace" accommodation sign went missing in 2005.
A note sent with it thanked the university "for the loan", said it had been well looked after, and was signed by "A sorry former sign thief".
The 3ft-long sign will now be replaced on the wall of the accommodation block.
The note stated that the thief had "grown up a lot since graduating from Bath" and added they "now work in management for a very well-known multinational brand and no longer steal signs".
Andrew Monk from the university said: "Our students take away lots from the university - impressive qualifications and experiences which prepare them for a variety of top jobs across all sectors - as well as occasionally, it seems, the odd sign too.
"As the university prepares for its 50th anniversary in 2016 we're delighted to hear from our alumni wherever they are in the world and of course we're always very grateful whenever they choose to give back - including when it's parts of our fixtures and fittings."
