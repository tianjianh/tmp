[SN]TITLE[SN]
Doncaster Rovers 3-1 Portsmouth

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
John Marquis scored in each half to help League Two leaders Doncaster Rovers to an impressive win over promotion-chasing Portsmouth.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Marquis headed Rovers into an early lead against his former side before Kal Naismith levelled just before the break with a cool, low finish.
Tommy Rowe's fierce strike into the top corner put the hosts back in front at the Keepmoat Stadium.
Striker Marquis made sure of victory with a crisp volley from 12 yards.
Pompey had chances to make it a closer contest, but Doncaster goalkeeper Marko Marosi kept them at bay with two superb saves.
The Slovakian first kept out Matthew Clarke's deflected header at point-blank range in the first half before tipping substitute Milan Lalkovic's headed effort wide late on.
However, the 23-year-old goalkeeper was then carried off on a stretcher after a collision in a goalmouth scramble.
Victory for Darren Ferguson's Doncaster, their eighth in 10 league matches, stretches their lead at the top to four points, while Portsmouth remain in fourth.
