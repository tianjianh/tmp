Plans by oil and gas explorer Ithaca Energy to pursue opportunities in the Greater Stella Area of the North Sea have been boosted by a $66m (Â£43m) investment from an Israeli conglomerate.

Ithaca said it had secured the equity from DKL Investments, a wholly-owned subsidiary of energy firm Delek Group.
The investment was made via a private placement of common shares.
The move gives Delek a 19.9% stake in AIM-listed Ithaca.
Aberdeen-based Ithaca is the operator of the Greater Stella Area development in the central North Sea. It includes the Stella and Harrier fields, which are currently in the process of being developed, as well as the Hurricane discovery and the "Twister" prospect.
First production from the Stella field is expected at the end of the second quarter next year.
The investment from Delek will be used to pursue "satellite" opportunities in the area, as well as strengthen Ithaca's balance sheet and cut its bank debt.
Ithaca chief executive Les Thomas said: "The investment provides a solid vote of confidence in the long term value of Ithaca by a successful oil and gas investor and provides additional flexibility to execute the financial and strategic priorities of the business."
