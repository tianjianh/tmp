The Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) report said cockpit footage showed the plane "responding to the pilot's control inputs".
It also said pilot Andy Hill was thrown clear of the aircraft during the later part of the crash on 22 August.
The AAIB said it was not clear whether Mr Hill initiated his ejection.
The 51-year-old pilot is currently in a serious but stable condition in hospital.
The report says the Hawker Hunter's canopy was released at the initial impact. At this time fuel and fuel vapour was released and then ignited.
The jet split into four parts and both Mr Hill and his seat were thrown clear of the cockpit.
The report states: "The investigation continues to determine if the pilot attempted to initiate ejection or if the canopy and pilot's seat were liberated as a result of impact damage to the cockpit."
The AAIB's report also revealed there was no "blackbox" flight recorder on the vintage jet, however, there were two cameras positioned in the cockpit.
It revealed: "To date, no abnormal indications have been identified [from the footage].
"Throughout the flight, the aircraft appeared to be responding to the pilot's control inputs."
The AAIB said it has received a "large amount" of video footage and photographs of the aircraft, many of which were taken in high resolution, from a variety of locations on and around Shoreham Airport.
It said an analysis of the still and moving images using "photogrammetry techniques" will be undertaken to establish the parameters of the aircraft's manoeuvres, including flight path and speed.
