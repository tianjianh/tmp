[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A drive-through pasty restaurant in Cornwall will be a "world first", the baker behind it has claimed.

Marion Symonds will offer pasties and cream teas to customers on the move from the site at Pool, Cornwall, from the end of June.
"People don't want to get out of their cars," said the baker, who has promoted Cornish pasties around the world.
The drive-through will be part of a bakery, coffee-shop and restaurant that will bring 40 new jobs to the area.
Mrs Symonds said: "So many towns now have been shut off and the bakers are in there. You have to go into a car park and walk to the baker's to buy a pasty.
"We thought if you stayed in your car and drove through the queues might come here instead of other drive-through restaurants."
Mrs Symonds, 50, started working in bakeries when she was 14 and was awarded the pasty ambassador award at the 2015 World Pasty Championships for her work promoting the pasty in Europe and Mexico.
She believes her drive-through pasty restaurant will be the first of its kind in the world.
Mrs Symonds opened her first bakery in Portreath and owns a second bakery in Lanner.
