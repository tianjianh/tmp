The servicemen, all from Bridlington, died fighting in the Second Battle of Ypres on 25 April 1915.
Members of the local Royal British Legion branch and armed forces veterans joined residents and family members at the town's war memorial earlier.
Local historian Chris Bonnett said it was important to remember the town's fallen men.
He said: "The impact it had on the town and the families, what with so many people being killed, was colossal.
"There were several other Bridlington boys seriously wounded that day, so it was the worst day of both world wars for Bridlington in terms of loss of life."
Mile Wilson lost his grandfather Jack in the Battle of St Julien.
He said: "I'm delighted that these people are here today because for 99 years, no-one cared about this day.
"[I suggested] we commemorate these men and this assembly is here, it's fantastic."
