Joey Barton: Rangers suspension continues for midfielder

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Joey Barton remains suspended by Rangers following a meeting with Ibrox officials on Thursday.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 34-year-old midfielder has been absent from the club since a training-ground row in the wake of September's 5-1 loss at Celtic Park.
He arrived at Ibrox at 15:00 BST on Thursday with agent Eddy Jennings, before leaving by a side exit some two hours later and offering no comment.
Barton is also facing Scottish FA charges for breaching betting rules.
He was charged with placing 44 bets on games between 1 July and 15 September.
Barton, who has stated repeatedly that he wants to return and fight for his place, has played only eight games for Rangers since his summer switch from Burnley.
The former Manchester City, Newcastle United and QPR player left Turf Moor under freedom of contract at the end of last season, signing a two-year deal at Ibrox.
