Three faces have joined the political line up in North Yorkshire following general election victories.

Labour's Rachael Maskell took York Central while the Conservative's Rishi Sunak replaced former foreign secretary William Hague in Richmond.
In Ryedale, the Tories retained Thirsk and Malton with the election of their new candidate Kevin Hollinrake.
Speaking to BBC Radio York's political reporter Gemma Dillon, the trio outlined their future priorities.
Kevin Hollinrake was chosen to fight Thirsk and Malton when the local Conservative Party de-selected former MP Anne McIntosh.
The father of four, who held the Conservative seat with 27,545 votes to Labour's 8,089, says he is "proud to represent the area he has lived and worked in."
Describing his first week at the House of Commons, he said: "It was a bit surreal to be having my lunch and suddenly see [chancellor] George Osborne on the next table."
Mr Hollinrake's goals include making sure North Yorkshire "gets a fair share" of money invested by government in rural areas.
The new MP for Richmond says he is all too aware of the boots he has to fill in William Hague's former constituency.
The son-in-law of Indian tech titan Narayana Nurthy described his first week at Westminster as being like "a cross between freshers' week and Hogwarts."
He promised to put the large, rural patch on everyone's radar.
"That means better broadband, more accessible health care, supporting our farmers, and making sure we can have a vibrant local economy in a rural area with every opportunity that we are seeing in cities," he said.
The former Unite rep is the lone Labour voice and female representative from North Yorkshire at Westminster.
Ms Maskell bucked the national trend for Labour, winning a comfortable majority of 7,000 in York Central and boosting the party's share of the vote.
She replaces Sir Hugh Bayley who had represented voters in York since 1992, but stood down at this election.
"My focus is to protect people across York and to make sure parliament does the right thing for the electorate," she said.
