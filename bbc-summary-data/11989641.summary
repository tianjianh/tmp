Obituary: James Adams

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A church deacon from Bretton in Peterborough, James Adams was a man with a tolerance of all faiths.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 32-year-old mortgage adviser was caught in the Piccadilly Line Tube blast on 7 July 2005 while on his way to work in the Strand.
He called his mother from King's Cross to let her know he had arrived safely and was about to board the Tube.
He was a member of the Bretton Baptist Church, where he had been a deacon for two years.
Shortly after his death, his parents, Elaine and Ernest Adams, said in a statement: "James was a deeply loved son and brother, who lived and loved life to the full.
"We do not know who is ultimately responsible for our loss but we do not hold any religion or faith accountable."
His funeral service was packed with mourners.
His father told them: "He was more than a son to us, he was our best friend."
Among those who paid tribute was the Labour MP for Tottenham, David Lammy.
They went to boarding school together at Peterborough King's School, where Mr Lammy was head boy and James a chorister.
Mr Lammy said: "When people die it is common to say there was not a bad word to say about them but with James that was absolutely the case.
"He was one of the nicest people I have ever known. He was charming, very polite and a strong Christian. His faith was important to him.
"The degree of sadness at his death is very, very deep. It is just very difficult to contemplate that James is not with us any more and has been taken from us in the way he has."
After boarding school, Mr Adams went on to study politics and economics at university, where he formed very close and loyal friendships and played an active part in the Christian Union.
He moved into the insurance industry afterwards and, at the time of the bombings, was working for Momenta Holdings.
Pat Oundle, who worked with him, said: "He was the nicest, kindest man you could wish to meet. He was good company and witty, and always ready to help anyone in his job."
Mr Adams was a Manchester United fan, and enjoyed Formula 1.
His support for an orphanage project in southern India during his lifetime led to a building being erected in his memory after his death.
Five years on, a statement from Mr Adams' parents read at the inquest said: "James would have loved to have been married and to have had a family, but after 7/7, this was not to be.
"James is remembered by family and friends as a devoted and loving person."
