Manchester United midfielder Marouane Fellaini says he has the "trust" of his team-mates and manager Jose Mourinho.

The 29-year-old was sent off for headbutting Sergio Aguero in last month's Manchester derby, and has been singled out for criticism by some fans.
Asked whether he was bothered by what people said about him, Fellaini replied: "No. I try to do my job, give the best of myself and win games."
The Belgian said he "enjoys" the pressure of playing for a big club.
Former United defender Gary Neville said Aguero "played Fellaini like a fool" during the incident which led to him being sent off at Etihad Stadium.
Fellaini said: "The staff trust me. The manager, my team-mates. They are the most important."
Fellaini was the first significant signing of the post-Sir Alex Ferguson era, joining the Red Devils from Everton for Â£27.5m in August 2013.
He has featured in every match of this season's Europa League knockout phase, scoring the crucial second-leg goal against Celta Vigo that helped United into Wednesday's final against Ajax in Stockholm.
Neither Fellaini's old boss at Everton, David Moyes, nor his successor Louis van Gaal, were able to restore United to their former glories.
In Mourinho's first season, United slipped one place in the Premier League to sixth.
They did win the EFL Cup, and Fellaini says victory over Ajax - which would mean qualification for next season's Champions League group phase - would represent a good season.
United are attempting to become the fifth team to win all three European trophies, having already won the European Cup/Champions League and Cup Winners' Cup.
"When you change a manager like Sir Alex Ferguson it is difficult," said Fellaini, who has made 132 appearances for the club.
"It was a new generation. A new team. You needed time to build a team.
"Slowly, slowly Manchester United win titles. Last season we won the FA Cup. This season we have won two titles. Now we are in the final of the Europa League.
"We have to give everything so there are no regrets at the end."
