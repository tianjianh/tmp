The 60-year-old victim was found with multiple stab wounds at her home in Sunny Bank Road, Helmshore at 22:40 GMT on Friday.
She is believed to be Sadie Hartley, Lancashire Police said. A formal identification is yet to take place.
A 34-year-old woman from Chester is in police custody.
Ms Hartley spoke to a colleague at about 19:30 on Thursday but there was no further contact, police said.
Officers want to trace an "old style" Renault Clio car and three other people seen in CCTV footage of the area at about 20:00 on Thursday.
A man was seen walking out of the cul-de-sac towards the village store on Holcombe Road and passing another person. A jogger is also seen in the footage running in the opposite direction, police said.
Det Supt Paul Withers of Lancashire Police said: "We believe that this could be around the time that [Ms Hartley] was murdered and we want to trace these people as soon as possible.
"We also know that this area is regularly used by dog walkers so we are keen to speak to anyone who frequently uses the route along Sunny Bank Road and may have seen anything out of the ordinary in the days and weeks preceding the murder."
A post-mortem examination confirmed the cause of death was multiple stab wounds.
Anyone with information is urged to call Lancashire Police on 101 or Crimestoppers.
