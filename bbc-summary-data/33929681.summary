The driver circled around the 78-year-old in what officers described as a "sickening twist", before driving off.
The victim was knocked down as he crossed Beacon Lane, in Sedgley, at about 15:30 BST on Thursday.
Officers are appealing for help to track down the driver of a white van and his passenger.
They said a number of witnesses had come forward and the incident was captured on CCTV.
PC Leon Whitmore said the victim was well-known in the area and local people had been left "left very angry, stunned and sickened".
"If the driver didn't have the courage to stop at the scene, he or his passenger need to find some now and call police," he said
"This is their chance to come forward and explain what happened."
Both men are described as being in their 20s and were wearing high-visibility jackets. They left the scene in what is believed to be a white, Renault Kangoo van, police said.
The vehicle was missing two wheel trims and had a large custom-fitted lock on the rear doors.
