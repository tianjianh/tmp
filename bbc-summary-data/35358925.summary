Asylum housing doors to be repainted after abuse claims

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The front doors of houses used by asylum seekers are to be repainted, after claims they were targeted because nearly all of the doors were red.

Asylum seekers in Middlesbrough told The Times eggs and stones had been thrown at their houses because the doors made them easy to identify.
The immigration minister said he was "deeply concerned" about the issue.
G4S said there was no policy to house asylum seekers behind red doors but its subcontractor would be repainting them.
The Times visited 168 houses in Middlesbrough owned by Jomast, a sub contractor for the global security firm G4S, and found 155 had red doors.
Is Middlesbrough the UK's Germany?
BBC correspondent Andy Moore said it was thought the door colour may have been a convenient way for the company to identify its properties.
Former local councillor Suzanne Fletcher told the BBC's Today programme she had raised the issue with G4S as far back as 2012 but was told the company would not ask Jomast to repaint the doors.
She went on to submit evidence to the Home Affairs Select Committee, Public Accounts Committee and National Audit Office.
She said: "Over four years ago when I was working with groups of asylum seekers, they were worried it marked them out and were worried about attacks."
The charity Refugee Council said it "has long held concerns about the quality and security of asylum accommodation".
It added: "The government must not tolerate its contractors taking a lax attitude towards housing these vulnerable people. Such an approach is clearly jeopardising their safety."
G4S said Jomast had no policy to house asylum seekers behind red doors but accepted the majority of doors, both for private and asylum accommodation, were painted red.
Immigration minister James Brokenshire said he had commissioned an urgent Home Office audit of asylum seeker housing in the North East.
He said: "I expect the highest standards from our contractors. If we find any evidence of discrimination against asylum seekers it will be dealt with immediately as any such behaviour will not be tolerated."
G4S said in a statement: "Although we have received no complaints or requests on this issue from asylum seekers we house, in light of the concerns raised Jomast has agreed to address the issue by repainting front doors in the area so that there is no predominant colour.
"Our asylum accommodation is inspected frequently by the Home Office and has been found to meet the required standards."
