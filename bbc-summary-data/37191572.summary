Rory Burns passed 1,000 Championship runs in 2016 as he and Dom Sibley saw the hosts to victory before lunch.
Lancashire, who began day four 10 runs ahead with two wickets remaining, were 230 all out in their second innings.
Left-arm seamer Footitt removed tailenders Nathan Buck and Kyle Jarvis to help Surrey take 23 points from the match at The Oval.
Surrey are just seven points behind Middlesex but have played two games more than the Championship leaders and have only two matches of the season remaining.
Meanwhile, Lancashire cricket director Ashley Giles admitted before their defeat that he had concerns about his side becoming involved in a fight against relegation.
The Red Rose county have not won in the Championship since May.
Surrey captain Gareth Batty told BBC Radio London: "We started on the front foot and finished on the front foot. It was a pretty complete performance.
"Mark Footitt deserved the seven wickets, I thought he bowled brilliantly. People forget he has moved clubs. Moving to a big club like Surrey can be hard. He's bowling on different surfaces too and he's adapted quite magnificently.
"He's bowled well at times this season without any luck."
Lancashire batsman Alviro Petersen told BBC Radio Lancashire: "We have to draw a line under it, but we can take a lot from this. When you are behind a game, it's difficult to come back, especially if the opposition don't allow you to. We could have played better, but it wasn't to be.
"Another win or two will change the whole season for us. When we started by winning those games up front, we were flying.
"But we certainly need another win to stay up. If we lose one or two more games, we are struggling."
