Full schedule for 2016 meeting
Dual winner Sole Power was taken out of the King's Stand Stakes with trainer Eddie Lynam stating the ground was unsuitable for his horse.
The course had 27mm of rain between Friday and Sunday, with a mixture of sunshine and showers expected during the week.
Breeders' Cup Mile winner Tepin will have to cope with the going and is being challenged for favouritism in the first race by the Godolphin-owned hopeful Belardo.
Mecca's Angel leads the field of sprinters in the King's Stand Stakes, while the Newmarket 2,000 Guineas winner Galileo Gold takes on Atwaad, winner of the Irish version, and French Guineas victor The Gurkha in the St James's Palace Stakes.
Ryan Moore, who rides The Gurkha for Irish trainer Aidan O'Brien, made history at last year's meeting by  riding a record nine winners.
Ascot continues a big year for the Queen - who is expected to attend every day - with Thursday's feature race renamed the Gold Cup In Honour of the Queen's 90th Birthday.
The Queen is seeking her 23rd Royal Ascot winner as an owner, with the last coming courtesy of Estimate in the 2013 Gold Cup.
Estimate is now retired from racing and is expecting her first foal next year having started a breeding career.
But the Queen is expected to have up to six runners this week including Dartmouth in Saturday's Hardwicke Stakes, with another two horses set to run for the Prince of Wales and Duchess of Cornwall.
Ascot is renowned as a meeting where top action on the track mixes with style and glamour off it.
In 2015, around 2,400 kilos of whole sirloin beef, 3,700 rumps of lamb and 2,900 Scottish lobsters were served.
A further 51,000 bottles of champagne, 125,000 glasses of Pimms and 45,000 afternoon teas were consumed.
