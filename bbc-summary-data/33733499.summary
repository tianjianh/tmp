National League club Forest Green Rovers stopped selling red meat burgers and sausages four years ago, and later chicken, but has now also dropped fish.
The club's chairman, Dale Vince, who also owns green energy firm Ecotricity, said it was "bringing better food to football".
A club supporters trust spokesman said the move was "not a big deal" and "not a dramatic step".
Mr Vince said: "Food is a really important issue for us - it's a big environmental and sustainability issue, and it's a frontier we've been exploring for a few years now.
"We started by removing red meat from the menu, then going vegetarian, and now we've teamed up with [local chef] Nick [Allan] from Star Anise Cafe. It's another big step."
He added that the new menu at The New Lawn in Nailsworth, Gloucestershire, would include the new "Q-Pie", which is made of Quorn, and hand-made in Stroud.
Forest Green Rovers supporters trust chairman Tim Barnard said: "When they first stopped serving red meat there was a general feeling of shock, but over the last few years the food on sale has been of a high standard.
"The vegetarian options have been very popular, so this move to a completely vegetarian menu is not such a dramatic step as it was before.
"I'm not a vegetarian myself but it's no big deal. I can still eat meat at home."
He added that there was still a minority of fans who "think they have the right" to eat meat pies at a football match.
