Mortonhall baby ashes memorial gets green light

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Plans for a memorial to infants at the centre of the Mortonhall baby ashes scandal have been given the green light by councillors.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The garden with a circular walled garden in the grounds of Mortonhall crematorium is expected to be completed by November this year.
Parents were asked to choose between four different designs.
The pond originally proposed will be replaced with a stone water feature due to safety fears.
It will include beech hedges, birch trees, a stone ball water feature, rocks, a pathway and seating and will be located off the existing memorial walkway not far from the main chapel.
A second memorial is to be built in Princes Street Gardens as some families had strong views that they did not wish to return to Mortonhall.
