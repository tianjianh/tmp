Neknominate: Bereaved mother speaks out over online dare

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
From the relatively tame ice bucket challenge to the utterly senseless fire challenge, the internet is awash with all manner of social media crazes.

But for one man from south Wales, an online dare proved fatal. In her first interview since the tragedy, his mother spoke to BBC One Wales' Week In Week Out about the dangers of internet challenges.
"I had a phone call from my son Paul saying, 'Mum you need to come over. Stephen's not well'. By the time I got there it was too late. That night was the first time I'd heard about Neknominate."
Paula Brookes is angry and with good reason. Her son Stephen died of alcohol poisoning in February 2014 after downing a most of a bottle of vodka in an online drinking challenge. He was just 29 years old.
"My heart was ripped in two and I miss him," she says. "A lot of people miss Stephen and I just wish that day never happened.
"If only they didn't do these stupid things with Facebook and the internet just to give everybody a thrill, then Stephen would still be here today."
Mr Brookes, from Rumney in Cardiff, had been drinking with friends after watching Wales play Ireland in the Six Nations.
A few weeks earlier he had been "Neknominated" - a craze where people post videos of themselves on social media "necking" alcohol and nominating friends to do the same.
Friends said he downed the vodka "in seconds".  He died within an hour and was later found to have 458 millilitres of alcohol in his blood. The drink-drive limit is 80.
Stephen's was one of five deaths linked to the Neknominate craze in the UK and Ireland.
But thousands more have put their lives at risk by performing reckless stunts online.
The cinnamon challenge, for example, saw thousands of people posting videos of themselves swallowing a tablespoon of ground cinnamon without water.
It might sound harmless enough but the spice is caustic and trying to gulp it down can cause choking, throat irritation, breathing trouble and even collapsed lungs.
Then there was the fire challenge, in which people set themselves alight, timed how long it took to put out the flames and posted the whole thing on social media. Unsurprisingly, several people ended up with serious burns.
Wetnominate began with people pouring buckets of water over each other to raise money for charity. But, in an attempt to outdo their friends, "nominees" soon began jumping off bridges.
One man somersaulted off the Coed Bridge in Cynon Valley in August 2014. The video, uploaded to Facebook, went viral, with thousands sharing and liking it.
Police and the local MP Ann Clwyd cautioned against copying but it seems no amount of warning will deter a determined would-be internet star.
Peer pressure, the need to belong and a desire to be noticed will compel many people - especially younger people - to keep taking ever bigger risks in the pursuit of online fame, says social media expert Dr Laura Toogood.
"If you're going to create something that's really going to stand out, it has to be quite extreme for it to get noticed in the first place," she said.
"And I think that's one of the driving factors in these extreme videos, is that you have to do something that's more dangerous than the person before, or more interesting or more cutting edge in order to get the attention and to get the wow factor."
Two year's after her son's death Paula Brookes and her family are still living with the fallout of an online prank gone wrong.
But despite her anger and heartbreak, she still finds comfort in social media through a Facebook account set up to remember her son.
"I get messages every day on Stephen's page," she says. "I enjoying looking at the messages from all his friends, different pictures, poems, songs.
"Stephen's personality was absolutely amazing. He was funny, he was kind, he just loved everybody.
"This is what keeps me going, all these different messages. Every single day there's something new."
Mrs Brookes has strong words for anyone thinking of taking on a dangerous social media dare:  "If anybody asks you to do anything silly, to drink, jump off bridges, jump off mountains, stick your hand in the fire, just say no because it could be your mum sitting here telling the story that I'm telling. Or your dad, your brothers or your sisters."
