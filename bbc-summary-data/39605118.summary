[SN]TITLE[SN]
West Ham United v Everton

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Andy Carroll is a doubt for West Ham because of the recurrence of a groin injury, meaning Diafra Sakho could make his first start since November.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Winston Reid returns following five weeks out with a groin problem but Sam Byram and Mark Noble are both suspended.
Everton's on-loan forward Enner Valencia is ineligible to face his parent club.
James McCarthy may not play again this season because of a hamstring injury.
Muhamed Besic is nearing a return after missing the entire campaign with a knee injury.
Jonathan Pearce: "West Ham need three points for safety. Everton need to improve their away form to finish in the top five. They are favourites here even though they haven't won outside of Goodison Park for nearly three months.
"They've only lost once against the Hammers in 17 meetings. Romelu Lukaku has a lethal hit-rate against them. They also have pace in key attacking areas to trouble the patched-up home side.
"Injuries to Michail Antonio and Angelo Ogbonna, plus suspensions for Sam Byram and Mark Noble, leave Slaven Bilic short of numbers. Too many of his summer signings haven't come up to scratch.
"There is much work to be done before they're safe."
West Ham manager Slaven Bilic on a possible summer move for John Terry: "We are going to see. I'm a big admirer of John, he is one of the best that ever played, not only in that position but in general.
"He won everything, he did everything and we are talking about an England captain, a true leader.
"We are pretty well covered in that position, we have quality and we have experience, but we will see. You never say never."
Everton manager Ronald Koeman on Romelu Lukaku: "He has scored 24 goals and with five games to go he can reach a really high total.
"But I think he is improving in the rest of his football. He is doing better pressing and running in the channels. He is now a better striker for the team than he was last year.
"If someone is interested, for sure they will call the board and then we will speak about it but we will try to do everything to keep him at Everton next season."
When they are on the road, the Toffees just don't seem to create the same number of chances that they do at home, so I am going to go for a draw here.
