Several caravans are already on a field in Kesgrave, Suffolk, and word has spread on social media that more travellers were set to join the unauthorised camp on Grange Farm.
Suffolk Police said it had a "small police presence" in the area after reports of "community tension".
A police spokesman said no crime or disorder had been reported.
He said the area would continue to be monitored.
Pieces of farm machinery have also been used to block off a playing field off Millennium Way.
More than 3,000 residents have joined a community Facebook group to discuss the situation, with many people saying they have been monitoring green spaces overnight.
One said: "06.05am. Oak Meadow all clear. Thank goodness." Another posted photos of an empty Millennium field and car park.
One woman said: "When this is all over... lets have a grange farm residents BBQ/party at the millennium field... to celebrate the residents coming together during this worrying time..everyone has shown great community spirit."
Others have been discussing fears about children walking to school on their own.
The Gypsy Council has been approached for comment.
