Gay wedding canon Jeremy Pemberton faces service ban

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The first gay British clergyman to be married has had his permission to lead some services revoked.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Canon Jeremy Pemberton married his long-term partner in a civil ceremony in April, in defiance of guidance by Church of England bishops.
He has confirmed he will no longer be allowed to operate as a priest in Nottinghamshire, but remains a chaplain to hospitals in Lincoln.
Diocese officials said clergy must "model the Church's teaching".
Gay marriage became legal in the UK in March but the Church of England has not accepted the change.
At the time of his marriage, Mr Pemberton, who describes himself as activist for LGBT equality in church and workplace, said he would be the first of many.
The Rt Revd Richard Inwood, Acting Bishop for Southwell and Nottingham, said same sex marriage was clearly at variance with the teaching of the Church of England.
He added: "It said it would not be appropriate conduct for someone in holy orders to enter into a same sex marriage, given the need for clergy to model the Church's teaching in their lives.
"In view of this I have spoken to Jeremy Pemberton and subsequently written to him to tell him his permission to officiate in the Diocese of Southwell and Nottingham has been revoked."
Besides confirming the ban, Mr Pemberton declined to comment.
