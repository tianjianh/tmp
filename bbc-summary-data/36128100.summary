The Dresser, starring Sir Ian McKellen and Sir Anthony Hopkins, received two awards - one for its costumes and one for its make-up and hair.
Wolf Hall, meanwhile, was recognised for its editing and sound.
Another four programmes also received two awards at the London event, hosted by Episodes star Stephen Mangan.
They include Jonathan Strange and Mr Norrell, which received Baftas for its production design and visual effects, and nature documentary series The Hunt, honoured for its photography and music.
The programme's success in the latter category marked the first time since 2002 that an award for music has gone to a factual production.
With other awards going to London Spy and VE Day 70: The Nation Remembers, the BBC won 10 out of the 20 competitive awards handed out on Sunday.
But there was also a strong showing for Channel 4 productions, with Michaela Coel winning the breakthrough talent award for E4's Chewing Gum and Channel 4's The Murder Detectives being recognised for its direction.
The event also saw Shane Meadows honoured for directing This is England '90 and Russell T Davies receive a writing award for Channel 4's Cucumber.
Rob Delaney and Sharon Horgan were also given a writing award for their work on sitcom Catastrophe, in which they also appeared.
Sky drama Fortitude won an award for its "titles and graphic identity", while there were two prizes for ITV's The Sound of Music Live!
Casting director Nina Gold received a special award at the ceremony, which comes before the Bafta TV Awards on 8 May.
A full list of this year's winners and nominees can be found on the official Bafta website.
