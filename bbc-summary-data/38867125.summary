Plans for a £6m revamp of Newbury railway station have been awarded provisional funding.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Thames Valley Local Enterprise Partnership cash would be spent on creating better access for cyclists, walkers and public transport.
Great Western Railway (GWR) and West Berkshire Council have joined forces to undertake the refurbishment.
GWR said it hoped the funding, subject to planning permission, would help the station become a "gateway" to the town.
Jeanette Clifford, lead councillor for transport in West Berkshire, said the station "needs improving".
Detailed planning and a business case will now be created in order for the funding to be confirmed.
