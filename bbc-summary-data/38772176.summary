When Liverpool host Wolves in the FA Cup fourth round, it will be over two years since boyhood Reds fan Coady, now 23, was allowed to leave the club.
And he is intent only on helping his side become the third in a week to win at Anfield.
"We're going there to win and hopefully take the game to them," he told BBC WM.
Coady never got to play a home game in his three years at Anfield, with both his first-team appearances coming on the road, the second as a late sub for Philippe Coutinho in a 3-1 win at Fulham, his only one in the Premier League.
After a season-long loan with Sheffield United, he eventually moved on to Huddersfield Town in August 2014 and then Wolves a year later.
But Coady knows, from his experience watching the Reds as a boy, that Liverpool do not have many slumps of the current magnitude and Wolves might have timed their trip to Anfield just right.
"We've got a great chance the way Liverpool are playing," he said. "They're a top team but they've had quite a lot of games."
Since Wolves won 2-0 in the third round at Stoke on 7 January, Paul Lambert's men have only played twice, while Liverpool have been in action six times.
Of those six games, they have won only once - the FA Cup third-round replay at League Two side Plymouth - have failed to score in three of them and have lost their last two at home.
Following the shock home defeat by Swansea City which damaged their Premier League title hopes, Wednesday's League Cup semi-final exit to Southampton has cast a cloud over Anfield.
"We've got to take that into account," said Coady. "We've got go there on the front foot, try to stop them playing, hopefully nick the ball and see if we can get something out of it."
And what if Coady himself were to find the net? "It would be what dreams are made of," he grinned. "I'm not one of those who wouldn't celebrate. I'd go ballistic to score for this club. It doesn't happen very often."
Wolves boss Lambert knows what it takes to win at Anfield. His Aston Villa side did so in December 2012, and Wolves loan signing Andreas Weimann was one of the Villa scorers that day in a 3-1 victory.
So can he do it again? Fourth in the Premier League v 18th in the Championship?
"We're up against an iconic club, and we're going to have to handle the atmosphere and the crowd, but I'd be disappointed if we couldn't handle the occasion," Lambert told BBC WM.
"If we can do that, we can win the game. And I believe in them. Mentally, they're ready for it. They'll handle it."
Lambert is keenly awaiting his reunion with Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp, who he first met when they did the Pro Licence coaching course together in Germany in 2004.
He was playing for Celtic by then, long after he had helped Borussia Dortmund win the European Cup in 1997 and four years before Klopp took over as Dortmund boss in 2008.
"He was also at a club I was fortunate to play for," said Lambert. "There were connections between us and he went on to bring Dortmund back to where they should have been - two league titles, two cups and a kick away from winning the Champions League.
"He is a big character and a really top guy. Some interviews at the minute make me laugh."
