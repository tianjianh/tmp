Carl Ikeme: Wolves keeper's ban cut to two games following Norwich City dismissal

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Wolves keeper Carl Ikeme has had his ban for his red card during Saturday's game at Norwich City cut to two games.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 30-year-old was set to serve a three-match suspension for violent conduct after pushing Canaries midfielder Wes Hoolahan in the chest.
However, Wolves' claim that the punishment was excessive was upheld and the ban was reduced.
Ikeme will miss Wolves' FA Cup fourth-round tie at Liverpool and their Championship game at Barnsley.
Wolves decided to appeal against the decision following the 3-1 defeat at Carrow Road after being advised that, under new Fifa guidelines, a push in the chest is considered only a yellow-card offence.
But a Football Association independent regulatory commission rejected the club's claim of wrongful dismissal, which, if successful, would have seen Ikeme avoid any suspension.
