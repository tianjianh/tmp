The National League hosts were impressive in the first half, and almost took the lead through John McCombe's overhead kick, which went narrowly wide.
They continued to press and midfielder Paul Lewis could not find the target when in a good position inside the box, before Jack Mackreth shot over from close range.
Oxford threatened themselves, and Marvin Johnson's cross struck the top of the crossbar in the second half before Chey Dunkley's header rattled the post.
Visiting goalkeeper Simon Eastwood brilliantly kept out Chris Holroyd's low effort, before Mackreth hit the post late on.
Oxford, who reached the fourth round last year, will need to improve significantly for the replay at the Kassam Stadium on Tuesday, 13 December.
Former England midfielder Trevor Sinclair on BBC Two:
"Oxford boss Michael Appleton will be disappointed - they were playing against a team two leagues below and have not really turned up. They have been fortunate to get through this match and I am sure they will play better in the replay.
"Maybe Appleton will learn something from this as they have come a long way on the morning of the match and the players looked a bit leggy."
Macclesfield manager John Askey on BBC Two: "On another occasion, things could have gone for us and we could have got the win.
"Overall we played well, created a lot of chances, but needed a better final ball or finish. We had a little wobble for five minutes but I can't ask any more of the players.
"I don't think the gap between the EFL and non-league is as big as it used to be. There are a lot of full-time teams. We showed that we have got decent players.
"It will be difficult there in the replay. On home soil, Oxford will be a different proposition. We will have nothing to lose and if we can get a win it would be great."
Macclesfield winger Jack Mackreth: "We put in everything and deserved to win the game.
"We are happy with a draw. Hopefully we can go to their place and get a result. Our movement was good and we created a lot of chances."
Oxford head coach Michael Appleton: "A few of our younger players were shell-shocked at half-time. They showed spirit and quality in the first half and got after us. They made it very difficult.
"When you come to a National League side, it is tight. They had a lot of quality.
"We were very, very, very, poor. I am not stupid enough to think any different. I would like to see us play better in the replay.
"I have got to pick a better team in terms of the right personnel.
"Let's hope we get a tie that generates a bit of excitement and make sure both teams have everything to play for in the replay."
Ian Meatcher: Great performance from the non-league side. Not quite the cup upset we all wanted. Macclesfield Town are in the hat though.
Jamie: Macclesfield were excellent - real shame not to get the win but great result all the same. Onwards and hopefully upwards.
Elliot Owens: Can't believe that game finished 0-0. Perhaps a league side would have put away those chances and knocked Oxford out.
