The Championship club has not held talks with Celtic over signing former player Gary Mackay-Steven but Mackinnon is hopeful of bolstering his squad.
"There's a list of players I've spoken to the chairman about that we'd like to bring in," MacKinnon said.
"But there's nothing concrete in any of those at the moment."
After a run of 14 games unbeaten, United suffered defeats by Dumbarton and Hibernian before drawing against Queen of the South on Saturday.
That has left the Tannadice side six points behind Scottish Championship leaders Hibs and MacKinnon is keen to sign players who can immediately contribute to their promotion campaign.
"You're looking at a loan signing," the United manager said. "People who have been training or [only] playing a certain number of games. People who are out of contract just now generally haven't played for a few months so it's more difficult to get them up to speed.
"It's very difficult in this window to get players in but we're looking around at the moment. I've not spoken to anybody."
MacKinnon takes his side to Dingwall on Saturday to face Ross County in the Scottish Cup, a venue where thy won 3-2 in the quarter-finals last season.
United were then relegated from the top flight, but MacKinnon does not believe there will be a significant difference between the two teams at the weekend.
"They're a Premiership team and they're doing just fine," the United manager explained.
"It will be a real challenge for us, but we've got a good squad and I'm certain we can go up there to try to win the game.
"I don't think there will be any gulf, it's just about who plays the best football on the day. They're at home, so it will be a difficult game for us.
"It's a very important [game], it's the Scottish Cup and everybody wants to do well in that.
"The next game in front of you is your priority, so the Scottish Cup is our priority, then after that the league will be our priority."
