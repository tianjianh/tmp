[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Gordon Goody, one of the last surviving members of the Great Train Robbery gang, has died aged 86, more than 50 years since the infamous heist.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
He had been living in the southern Spanish town of Mojacar, where he ran a bar.
A statement from the local town hall said he had died surrounded by friends. It did not reveal the cause of death.
Goody was sentenced to 30 years for his part in the 1963 robbery - one of the most notorious in British history.
On 8 August 1963 a gang masterminded by Bruce Reynolds stopped the Glasgow to London Euston overnight mail train as it passed through the Buckinghamshire countryside close to Cheddington.
The train was driven a mile-and-a-half to Bridego Bridge, where the gang unloaded more than £2.6m in used notes - worth about £46m today.
But they were later captured and 12 were jailed for a total of more than 300 years.
Train driver Jack Mills was struck over the head during the robbery and never worked again. He died in 1970.
More than one of the gang broke out of prison, including Ronnie Biggs, who spent over 30 years on the run before he finally returned to Britain in 2001 to face arrest. Biggs died in 2013 aged 84.
Reynolds, who served 10 years in jail, also died in 2013 aged 81.
Goody, who had been a hairdresser before the heist, was sentenced to 30 years but released in 1975, setting up his Spanish bar four years later.
