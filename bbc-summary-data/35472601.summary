Australian Open semi-finalist Johanna Konta pulled out of the team earlier this week because of illness.
Captain Judy Murray's team face South Africa and Georgia from Thursday in their bid to win promotion from Euro/Africa Zone Group 1.
Swann, 16, was a beaten finalist in the 2015 Australian Open junior final.
British number two Heather Watson will also play in the singles, while Jocelyn Rae and Anna Smith compete in the doubles.
Great Britain meet South Africa and Georgia in a three-team group, with the winners advancing to a play-off tie on Saturday.
Another play-off awaits the winners in April, when one more victory finally clinches promotion to World Group Two.
