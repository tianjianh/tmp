Thailand profile - media

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The government and military control nearly all the national terrestrial television networks and operate many of Thailand's radio networks.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Multichannel TV, via cable and satellite, is widely available. The radio market, particularly in Bangkok, is fiercely competitive. There are more than 60 stations in and around the capital.
The media are free to criticise government policies, and cover instances of corruption and human rights abuses, but journalists tend to exercise self-censorship regarding the military, the monarchy, the judiciary and other sensitive issues.
Restrictions on media output accompanied the introduction of martial law and an army coup in May 2014.
The print media are largely privately-run, with a handful of Thai-language dailies accounting for most newspaper sales.
There were some 23 million internet users by 2012. Pornographic sites, anti-monarchy sites and anti-government sites are subject to filtering. Hundreds of websites were blocked by the military following the 2014 coup.
Facebook is the most popular social network.
