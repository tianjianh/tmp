Plymouth Argyle manager Derek Adams has not given up hope of winning the League Two title, despite his side being 12 points behind leaders Northampton Town.

Argyle drew 0-0 at struggling Yeovil Town on Tuesday, while the Cobblers earned a 10th successive league win.
Northampton had been seven points behind Argyle at the start of November.
"You can never say it's over, there's 14 games to go, so there's a lot of points to play for, but they're in a very good position," Adams said.
Plymouth are still second in the table, but the gap to third-placed Oxford was cut to three points after their win over the Pilgrims' Devon rivals Exeter City.
"I think that Northampton have got a good chance of winning the league, the run they've been on is magnificent," Adams told BBC Radio Devon.
"It's very tight and we knew it was going to be that at the start of the season.
"We've put ourselves in a very good position, we just have to keep on trying too pick up points and trying to win games."
