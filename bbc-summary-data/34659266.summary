Lochaber Mountain Rescue Team found the party high in Observatory Gully and walked them down to a spot from where they could be airlifted from the hill.
A coastguard helicopter made the airlift.
Fort William-based Lochaber Mountain Rescue Team said the climbers were well equipped but had to endure a "very wet" night on the mountain.
None of the group were thought to have been hurt during their ordeal.
