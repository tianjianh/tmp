George Clooney's CCTV could 'violate privacy' of Sonning neighbours

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
George Clooney's neighbours in Sonning have lodged objections to the star's plans to install 18 CCTV cameras at his Oxfordshire home.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The film star and his lawyer wife Amal, want to put up eight cameras on poles in the grounds, up to five metres (16ft) high.
They also wish to attach a further 10 cameras to the property.
The Eye and Dunsden Parish Council has concerns over privacy and the CCTV system's visual impact on the village.
David Woodward, chair of the council, said: "When you are strolling next to a pretty riverbank, it's a visual intrusion close to where people are walking."
Mr Woodward said the CCTV could also cause privacy concerns for Mr Clooney's neighbours.
The property at Sonning Eye is located on an island in the River Thames on the county line between Oxfordshire and Berkshire.
South Oxfordshire District Council's conservation officer recommends approval as long as the cameras can easily be removed from the building.
The district councillor has until Friday to decide whether to put the application before a planning committee.
