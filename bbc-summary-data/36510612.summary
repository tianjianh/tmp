The UK air ambulance has arrived at the medical facility in Bangkok where Stephanie Inglis is being treated.
A spokeswoman for Stephanie's family, who are from Daviot, near Inverness, said they hoped to leave by 21:00.
Doctors in Vietnam initially gave the star a 1% chance of survival following the accident in Ha Long. She smiled for the first time on Saturday.
A post on the the Save Steph Facebook page on Saturday said: "First thing tomorrow morning they will start the handover process with her current medical team and between 7pm and 9pm UK time, assuming this time no tropical storms, the air ambulance will leave and commence its Journey to Scotland.
"This is a difficult Journey which will stop in India, Georgia and Austria and then it's final stage Stephanie Inglis against all the odds will be home."
The air ambulance will fly into Edinburgh. It is not yet clear which hospital Stephanie, who lives in Dunfermline, will be treated in.
The post revealed that the Commonwealth Games medallist smiled for the first time since waking from the coma during a physio session.
It said: "She is in so much discomfort and fighting against all the odds to improve herself when the medical team asked her if she could hold up 2 fingers, Stephanie did, and then she smiled a small but amazing smile.
"The doctor was so surprised he started to bow and laugh, because not only did it show that Stephanie understood this instruction it also showed after all that's happened to her she still had the humour and friendly personality that everyone respects and loves."
The post added: "Stephanie still has so much work and hard times ahead of her, and there will be dark and hard days when she comes to understand fully what has happened, but she now has so many people she knows will be there for her.
"I'm certain it will add light to what will be a slow and hard journey ahead, but with people to carry her when times are tough, no one can ask for more."
