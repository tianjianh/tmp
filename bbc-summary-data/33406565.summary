Jurassic World held on to the top spot at the North American box office over the 4 July weekend, fending off Terminator: Genisys and Magic Mike XXL.

The dinosaur sequel has now been number one for four weeks, taking an estimated $30.9m (£19.8m) between Friday and Sunday, according to early figures.
Pixar's Inside Out made $30.1m (£19.3m) in its third weekend of release.
Terminator: Genisys, the fifth film in the franchise, took $28.7m (£18.4m) over the weekend.
Channing Tatum's Magic Mike sequel made $12m (£7.7m) over the three days.
However once five-day totals are taken into account - as new entries were released on Wednesday instead of the usual Friday for the holiday weekend - box office returns appear more healthy.
Inside Out pulled in the most revenue overall with an estimated $45.3m (£29.1m) across 4,158 locations, ahead of Jurassic World's $43.8m (£28.1m) at 3,737 screens.
The Chris Pratt film currently ranks as America's fourth highest-grossing film on record, with a total $568.2m (£364.9m) in box office receipts.
Terminator: Genisys - which sees Arnold Schwarzenegger return to the franchise after sitting out 2009's Terminator Salvation - took $44.2m (£28.4m).
But it failed to match the $65.3m (£42m) five-day debut of Salvation, which opened over a Memorial Day holiday weekend.
Coincidentally, Jurassic Park also held off Schwarzenegger's Last Action Hero from the number one spot when both films were released in 1993.
Magic Mike XXL performed better in its first two days of release, helping it make $27m (£17.3m) overall. The original film opened with $39.1m (£25.1m).
Animated prequel Minions will open in North America next weekend after strong showing at the international box office - where it has made $124.2m (£79.8m).
Meanwhile, Walt Disney Studios has now reached the $3bn (£1.9bn) global box office milestone for the year - the fastest it has ever achieved the feat.
The success of Avengers: Age of Ultron, Cinderella and Inside Out helped the studio pass the mark five weeks faster than last year.
