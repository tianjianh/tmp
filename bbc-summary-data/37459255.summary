The decision followed a pitch inspection by the referee at 13:15 BST after heavy rain in south east Wales.
No new date has yet been set for the game to be played.
The game was due to be Newport's first with coach Sean McCarthy in caretaker charge after manager Warren Feeney was sacked on Wednesday.
