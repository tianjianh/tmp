Fresh negotiations have taken place with the city council to end the impasse over Aberdeen FC's proposed new stadium, club chairman Stewart Milne has said.

The Dons have planning permission for a site at Loirston Loch.
However, the move was put on hold when plans for an adjacent training academy were turned down.
Speaking after the club's AGM on Monday, Mr Milne said the new stadium remained on the agenda.
The AGM heard an annual report which showed a Â£1.4m loss for the year to June, a drop in turnover, and rising wages.
Mr Mile said: "I think we have the club in a fairly sound position.
"It has been a very challenging period for Scottish football, in a very difficult environment."
