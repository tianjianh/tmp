Michael Olsen, 52, from Dartford, Kent, shot PC Mark Bird in the hand after he crashed his Land Rover into a traffic island and several parked cars.
PC Bird had lunged forward to protect his colleague PC Robert Wilson after Olsen, of Lavinia Road, had pulled out a handgun in Westwood Lane, Welling.
Olsen later told police he believed the gun was a toy.
The jury at Inner London Crown Court found Olsen guilty of grievous bodily harm with intent, possession of a firearm with intent to endanger life, possession of ammunition with intent to endanger life and dangerous driving on Friday.
The shooting occurred shortly after 21:00 GMT on 3 October when the two officers were called to the street where Olsen's car was abandoned in the middle of the road.
They found Olsen but on approaching him he produced the gun and pointed it at PC Wilson, Scotland Yard said.
Det Con Toby Carroll, who investigated the case, said: "Olsen showed a reckless disregard throughout the evening of 3 October.
"It is only by chance that his decision to brandish and discharge a firearm at unarmed officers did not have fatal consequences, as could his behaviour behind the wheel of his car.
"His claim that the firearm was a toy was little more than pathetic. He will now spend a considerable time behind bars."
