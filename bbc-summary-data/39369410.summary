The 30-year-old, who also played for Wolverhampton Wanderers, Blackpool and Fulham, has been without a club since leaving Gillingham last year.
O'Hara appeared as a contestant on Channel 5 series Celebrity Big Brother earlier this year.
"When I came out of Big Brother, I had to be realistic about where I was going to play," he told BBC Essex.
Billericay are ninth in the Isthmian League Premier Division, three points adrift of a play-off place. The club signed former England international Paul Konchesky, 35, earlier this month.
Former England U21 international O'Hara played in the League Cup final for Tottenham against Manchester United in 2009. After the game finished goalless, he was the first of three players to miss penalties for Spurs as his side lost 4-1 in the shootout.
"I was worried the fact that I did Big Brother and with my injuries in the past whether I'd get back," O'Hara admitted.
"I wasn't getting a call (from league clubs) and this gives me a chance. I've committed to the end of next season."
Billericay have recently been taken over by multi-millionaire Glenn Tamplin, who said shortly after completing a deal for the club that he was "comfortable" investing Â£10,000 a week.
On Monday, club chairman Dan Groves confirmed "there is truth" in reports former The Only Way is Essex personality Mark Wright is set to invest in the club.
"I'm in negotiations with Mark, but I'm not sure if it will happen," Tamplin revealed. "There are no guarantees and we will see what happens.
"I know this might look like a media circus but money isn't important, it's about attitude and energy.
"People have to be coming here for the right reasons. I want this club in the Football League with crowds of 5,000 and I don't see why this can't happen."
Tamplin also revealed O'Hara has agreed to forfeit his wages if he gets injured and that a clause will allow him to leave if a "Championship or above" club comes in for him.
