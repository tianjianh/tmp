We made Chinese lanterns for Art in school! It was really cool, we even put Chinese writing on them.

I am a horse in the Chinese zodiac and so are a lot of my family, that's why we are celebrating. We played mini games and let off a Chinese lantern, it was epic. Also my friends are coming round for traditional meals and dressing up in red and orange clothes.

My teacher is from China even though she speaks English. We did a play of how the rat got the first year named after him. Also we got Chinese sweets, a sticker with the year of the horse on it and we all greeted each other in Chinese in the morning. It was great fun!

I love Chinese New Year because there are plenty of things to be doing.  My manna and granddad live in China so I go over sometimes for Chinese New Year and enjoy the fun.

Today we have been making Willow plates and we also made some origami cats. We dressed up in traditional Chinese clothes and we have learned some things about Chinese New Year. Did you know that Chinese New Year lasts for 15 days!?
Willow Class, Hoddesdon, England
We all dressed up in red clothes and traditional dress. We then had a huge celebration in our hall. We learned a Chinese dragon dance and tried lots of Chinese food. We really liked all the food especially the noodles, crackers and rice. We can't wait to celebrate again next year.
