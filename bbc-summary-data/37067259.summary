Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump endured several days of negative headlines after a string of controversial comments.
First, the billionaire contender described incumbent Barack Obama as the "founder" of the so-called Islamic State (IS).
Mr Trump also attacked his Democratic rival for the White House, Hillary Clinton, calling her a "co-founder" of the jihadist group, only to later say he was being sarcastic.

Earlier, the hotel developer-turned-politician appeared to urge his supporters to take up arms against Mrs Clinton to stop her from appointing liberal judges to the US Supreme Court if she won the November election.
Mr Trump later somewhat softened his rhetoric as polls suggested his support had been falling.
In addition, several leading Republicans have deserted Mr Trump.

The US later urged restraint by both sides.
