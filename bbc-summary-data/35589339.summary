[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man has gone on trial accused of planning a terror attack on UK or US military personnel in Britain.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Junead Khan, 25, from Luton, had a guide to making a "viable" pipe bomb on his laptop, Kingston Crown Court heard.
Prosecutors said he had planned to go abroad to fight for the Islamic State group but changed his mind and started preparing terrorist acts in the UK.
Mr Khan denies making preparations for attacking military personnel in the UK between May 10 and July 14, 2015.
Max Hill QC, prosecuting, said Mr Khan was "preparing for an attack on British forces or American soldiers or airmen".
He told the jury: "You may conclude that by arresting Junead Khan on 7 July, what happened at that moment was that his plans were therefore, we suggest, thwarted.
"He was not able to carry out what he wanted to do. But that makes him no less guilty of the charge."
Mr Khan is on trial alongside his uncle uncle, Shazib Khan, 23, also from Luton.
They are jointly charged with making preparations for travelling to Syria to fight for Islamic State. They both deny engaging in conduct in preparation of terrorist acts on 1 August 2014 and 15 July 2015.
The trial heard that Junead Khan was working as a driver for pharmaceutical firm Alliance Healthcare when he was arrested at its depot in Letchworth, Hertfordshire.
Prosecutors claim he drove close to air bases in East Anglia including the US Air Force's RAF Lakenheath and RAF Mildenhall in Suffolk.
Mr Hill said Mr Khan's work "meant that he was required to make deliveries of pharmaceuticals to locations in Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Norfolk" which took him near places "in which there were American air force personnel".
When police raided his home they found a balaclava and a laptop containing an article called "Make a bomb in the kitchen of your mom", from the online magazine of al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, giving instructions for the construction of a  "viable" pipe bomb, the jury was told.
The court also heard that police found black flags in his attic with Islamic State-type slogans and  pictures on his phone and laptop showing him posing in front of them in his bedroom.
The court was told that British and American flags believed to have been stolen from the New York Diner in Dunstable, Bedfordshire, were also found in the bedroom.
The case continues.
