Police have undertaken a major security operation during the funeral of a man who was murdered in Dublin.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
David Byrne, 33, was shot dead during a gun attack at a boxing weigh-in event at the Regency Hotel on Friday 5 February.
The funeral mass took place at St Nicholas of Myra Church on Francis Street.
Armed police maintained a discreet presence near the church throughout the service.
The shooting was carried out by a gang of six gunmen, one of whom is believed to be a paramilitary from County Tyrone.
Detectives believe that Mr Byrne was murdered in retaliation for the shooting of Gary Hutch on the Costa del Sol last September.
Before the service police carried out security checks in the area surrounding the church.
A police helicopter also circled overhead.
Mr Byrne is said to have had connections to an international drug gang which operates from the south of Spain.
Police have said they are keeping an open mind over suspected dissident republican involvement in the hotel killing.
