It will see road closures on Saturday as rugby fans flock to the Millennium Stadium, while a strike is also planned by some Cardiff Bus drivers.
On Sunday, Wales will face Israel at the Cardiff City Stadium.
Train operators said crowd management systems will be in place.
Cynthia Ogbonna, managing director of Cardiff Bus, said the number of its services running on Saturday was "not yet known".
"We are extremely apologetic for inconveniencing our customers and will do our best to ensure that we keep Cardiff moving during this time," she said.
On Sunday, there will be further bus route changes up until midday, as the city holds the Cardiff 10K race, with further road closures.
A spokesman for Arriva Train Wales added: "As with all major events in Cardiff we are expecting our services to be very busy this weekend."
Cardiff council said it would also be operating park and ride facilities to get rugby fans into the city centre on Saturday.
"A crowd of 50,000 is expected and the City of Cardiff Council is advising people to allow plenty of time to get into the city," said a spokesman.
