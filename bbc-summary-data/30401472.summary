'It's not my fault for passing out, it's his fault for raping me'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Maria, which isn't her real name, was 20 years old when she says she was raped following a poker night in her bedroom while studying at Oxford University.

"I got really drunk," she says. "I passed out and someone raped me."
It was only when she talked to a friend the day afterwards that she says the scale of what had happened hit her.
"I woke up at about two pm. My friend messaged me asking, 'What happened last night?'" Maria recalls.
"I felt a bit awkward about it. It was only when he said, 'Maria... that's rape' that I thought, 'Actually, like, that's not OK.'"
Maria says she did report her case but that police "weren't very helpful".
"I went to the police station first, then the police came over to my house and asked me to put my bed sheets, my clothes, and condoms in evidence bags," she says.
"This woman came over later, and she basically told them that my case wouldn't stand up in court - and to give me the evidence bags back.
Maria decided not to take the case any further but says she "doesn't think it was fair" for police to put pressure on her in that moment to make a decision about whether she wanted to do something, like take it to court or not.
In a statement, Thames Valley Police says it "takes all reports of rape and sexual offences extremely seriously" and that some of Maria's comments are "extremely concerning but as [she] has written it anonymously we need [her] to contact us directly so we can identify the case and properly investigate the claims being made".
Maria says she doesn't think she will take up her case again with the police as too much time has passed and she doesn't have the evidence any more.
Oxford University is made up of 38 colleges. She also recalls what she says happened when she spoke to her college welfare officers about being raped.
She says the college had a few conversations with her alleged attacker about it.
"A couple of weeks later they decided that it was OK, that they could drop it."
Maria talks about how uncomfortable she has felt and said they had "parties in college and he was always kind of around".
Since Maria blogged about her case, Oxford University has revised its harassment policy and developed new guidance for all staff on handling cases of sexual assault or violence, including rape.
In a statement, the university says it takes the issues Maria raises very seriously.
"Sexual violence, like all forms of sexual harassment, is unacceptable at Oxford University.
"Support for all victims, including of sexual violence, rape or assault, is available at a number of levels and now co-ordinated centrally."
There has also been sexual consent workshops launched as part of Freshers' Week.
It's an issue that's been discussed at other universities as well. Last month Greater Manchester police started a new rape campaign together with student unions and universities in north-west England.
"Drinking is not a crime. Rape is," reads a leaflet that's been distributed to bars, clubs and student accommodation.  They're also encouraging that message to be shared on social media using #noconsentnosex.
In October the National Union of Students started a sexual consent pilot scheme with 20 students' unions from further and higher education that aims to "facilitate positive, informed and inclusive conversations and campaigns about consent".
The NUS also completed a campaign last week called reclaim your campus, which focused 16 days of activism against gender violence.
One of the pledges of that campaign was urging universities to "investigate the level of harassment and assault on campus and publicly publish the results".
There is currently no official data from the Office of National Statistics on the number of rapes that occur at universities in the UK.
The latest rape figures from the ONS show 22,116 rapes were recorded in England and Wales in the year from July 2013 to June 2014.
Maria thinks overall attitudes need to change about being raped while drunk.
"It's not my fault for passing out, it's his fault for raping me," she says.
While she's not taking the case further, Maria is confident the person who raped her is aware of the blog she wrote about it.
"As much as I hate his face, I would still love to have seen his face when he read that," she says.
"He must know that I'm a click of a button away from telling everyone that he's a rapist and that feels extremely empowering.
"I almost feel like that's enough for me. I don't need him in prison and I like to think with sexual consent workshops in college, he won't reoffend."
Maria also doesn't want that one night to define her.
"I like to think that there's more to my personality than just being a person who got raped," she says.
"I don't want people to look at me and think, 'That's the girl that got raped.' I want them to think, 'That's the girl that did X, Y and Z. She's amazing.'"
