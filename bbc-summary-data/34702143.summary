UK documentary makers face Indonesia jail term

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Two UK journalists are facing a prison sentence for allegedly filming a documentary about piracy in Indonesia while on a tourist visa.

Neil Bonner and Rebecca Prosser were arrested by the Indonesian navy off the island of Batam on 28 May and their trial started in September.
The pair are charged with violating immigration laws.
They were filming footage for a National Geographic show about maritime piracy in South East Asia.
Batam island is just south of Singapore and near the Malacca Strait, an important international shipping lane.
Prosecutor Bani Ginting, in his closing remarks to court, said the two journalists were "legally and convincingly guilty" of misusing their tourist visas for "inappropriate activity".
Indonesian prosecutors are recommending that the pair should be sentenced to five months in jail and pay a fine of more than $3,000 (Â£1,944).
Their lawyer, Aristo Pangaribuan, told the BBC that what they did was a "misdemeanour" rather than a criminal act.
Journalists wanting to report from Indonesia need a special press visa.
Reporters without Borders said journalists caught working without a press visa in Indonesia were usually deported.
The Foreign Office said: "Our embassy staff are providing assistance to two British nationals detained in Batam, Indonesia.
"We are also in regular contact with their families and legal representatives. We have had a number of discussions with Indonesian authorities regarding this case, and will continue to follow it very closely."
The UK journalists were working for London-based production company Wall to Wall and the trip was being funded by National Geographic.
A Wall to Wall spokesman has previously said: "Neil, Rebecca and Wall to Wall are co-operating fully with the relevant authorities, and we hope that Neil and Rebecca will be released and reunited with their families as soon as possible."
Rebecca Prosser's sister, Natalie Prosser, told the BBC: "Becky is a very strong woman... but she is in a mainly male prison, there are only a handful of women there".
She said the trial was "taking its toll" on the documentary maker and that she "has coped very well in difficult circumstances".
Some local journalists held a protest outside court last week and Zuhri Muhammad, the Batam-based chairman of the Alliance of Independent Journalists, told the BBC that he regarded the trial as a threat to all journalists in Indonesia.
"This trial means that the authorities have criminalised journalists for doing their job".
Reporters without Borders said nine Indonesians, including the pair's fixer Ahmadi, are facing a possible two-year jail term or a fine.
Last year two French journalists were "victims of Indonesia's draconian immigration laws" when they were convicted of "misusing an entry visa", the group said.
Reporters without Borders said they had been arrested in the eastern province of Papua for trying to do a report about separatists in the region.
They were held for two and a half months and their sentence covered the time they had already been detained.
