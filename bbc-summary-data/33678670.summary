Diego Fabbrini: Middlesbrough sign Watford midfielder on loan

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Middlesbrough have signed midfielder Diego Fabbrini on a season-long loan from Premier League newcomers Watford.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Fabbrini has Championship experience with his parent club, as well as playing 17 games on loan at Millwall and Birmingham City last season.
The 24-year-old broke his nose playing for Blues, an injury which forced him to wear a protective facemask.
Fabbrini's move ends any hopes that Blues boss Gary Rowett had of bringing him back on loan to St Andrew's.
The Italy international, whose sole appearance came against England in 2012, joined Watford from Udinese.
Boro also hope to complete a deal to sign striker Christian Stuani from Espanyol this week.
