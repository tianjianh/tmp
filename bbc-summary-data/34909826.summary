Police and crime commissioner (PCC) Ian Johnston said the Home Office cuts may affect the ability of his force to deal with a Paris-style attack.
Gwent Police said it will be expected to save Â£65m by 2021, and was likely to lose 300 officers by 2018.
Senior figures at the North Wales and Dyfed-Powys forces gave warnings about cuts in September.
In an email to staff, North Wales Chief Constable Mark Polin said cuts of 25-40% had been suggested to his force.
Dyfed-Powys PCC Christopher Salmon raised concerns about a change in the funding formula which he claimed would favour urban forces over those serving largely rural areas.
Earlier in November, South Wales PCC Alun Michael invited public comments on his policing plan for the region, warning that "further deep cuts" in Home Office funding seemed "inevitable".
