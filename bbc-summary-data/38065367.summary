Plans to protect two storm-hit beaches on the Jurassic Coast from future flooding have gone on display.

West Bay's east and west beaches, in Dorset, were affected by flooding earlier this year and in 2014.
Waves overtop the seawall and flood the road and properties behind West Beach, and East Beach is at risk of being "significantly lost", the Environment Agency said.
Options for new defences have gone on display at Bridport Town Council.
A public consultation on the Environment Agency and West Dorset District Council plans will run throughout the winter.
Options at West Beach - where the beach is narrowing towards the eastern end - include rebuilding the existing seawall wall as a "strong flood wall", constructing a new groyne to the east and extending the existing groyne, the Environment Agency said.
A rock structure could be constructed and buried under the sand at East Beach, as well as a new sea wall, set back from the seafront.
The proposals also aim to protect Park Dean Embankment, George Street Pumping Station and the Harbour Sluices, as well as the area along the River Bride from Freshwater to Burton Bradstock.
Detailed design and construction is expected to take place between next year and 2019.
