[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The man was attacked by five masked men who went into a house at Ballymagowan Avenue, Creggan at about 00:03 BST on Monday.
He was taken to hospital where injuries to his head and legs are not believed to be life-threatening.
Just before 03:00 BST police were told that bins had been put against the door of the same house and set alight.
The fire caused considerable damage to the property, police have appealed for information on both attacks.
Ch Insp Tony Callaghan said: "Those who are involved in paramilitary style attacks do not represent the interests of any community nor contribute anything to it.
"Communities have a choice, and it is clear that the vast majority of people here have chosen to support the police and support law and order.
"Those small groups of individuals who continue to try and terrorise people and commit criminal acts must be isolated from communities," he added.
