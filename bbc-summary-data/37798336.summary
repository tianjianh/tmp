West Brom manager Tony Pulis has signed a new contract, extending his deal at The Hawthorns by a year to 2018.

The 58-year-old Welshman arrived at the club in January 2015 and has guided the Baggies to 13th and 14th-place finishes in the Premier League.
The club was sold to a Chinese investment group, led by entrepreneur Guochuan Lai, in September.
"This is a time of great change at Albion and when that happens you need continuity," said Pulis.
"I want to build things here and play my part in improving the club. You cannot do these things overnight but I do believe, step by step, we are making advances.
"I think the bulk of our fans understand the process we embarked upon under the shadow of relegation less than two years ago."
Pulis has been criticised by some sections of the Baggies support for the team's style of football, but says his priorities are keeping the club in the top flight and in profit.
The club reported pre-tax profits of £14.7m and £7.6m in 2015 and 2016 respectively.
West Brom broke their transfer record to sign midfielder Nacer Chadli from Tottenham for £13m in the summer, but Pulis was frustrated by their failure to bring in more of his targets.
Chairman John Williams said the new owners' aim of moving West Brom into the top half of the Premier League would be achieved gradually.
"The takeover announcement made it clear this new era would work to progress Albion to an established top-10 club without jeopardising continuity on and off the field," he added.
"With this is mind, I am pleased we have extended Tony's contract. The board and the owner believe this extension will bring us the key dual benefits of stability and improvement."
West Brom are 13th in the Premier League with 10 points from nine games.
