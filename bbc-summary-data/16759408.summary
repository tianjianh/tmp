Roman Polanski, who directed the 36-year-old in recent release Carnage, will present her with the prize.
French drama Poliss, written, directed by and starring Maiwenn lead the shortlist with 13 nods, including best film and director.
The Minister picked up 11 nods and silent film The Artist was up for 10.
The French silent film, which is one of the leading contenders at this year's Academy Awards, was re-released in France on Wednesday.
"Don't forget that the Cesar awards were created in homage to the Oscars," French Film Academy president Alain Terzian told The Hollywood Reporter.
He added that the Cesars symbolically take place in the same weekend as the Oscars.
"It's an homage I want to permanently pay," said Mr Terzian.
He said they are expecting The Artist stars Jean Dujardin and Berenice Bejo, both up for Cesar acting prizes, to attend the French ceremony, before flying to the US for the Oscars.
The Artist and Poliss will compete alongside The Minister, Declaration of War, Le Havre and Untouchable in the best film category.
Poliss, about a police child protection unit, was presented with the jury prize at last May's Cannes Film Festival.
British film The King's Speech received a nomination in the best foreign film category, and was joined by Black Swan, Drive, The Kid With The Bike, Melancholia and Iranian Oscar hopeful A Separation.
French actor-director Guillaume Canet will preside over the annual awards in Paris on 24 February.
