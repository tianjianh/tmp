County Championship: Jack Leaning makes ton against Notts

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Yorkshire's Jack Leaning scored a maiden first-class century as his side gave themselves a chance of beating Nottinghamshire at Trent Bridge.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 21-year-old made 116, including a six and 12 fours, as they totalled 441 all out for a first-innings lead of 13.
He shared stands of 111 and 69 with Rich Pyrah (37) and Tim Bresnan (34) before being stumped off Samit Patel.
Left-arm spinner Patel claimed 4-102, but Nottinghamshire then struggled to 74-3, just 61 runs ahead.
Leaning's only previous hundred for Yorkshire was an innings of 111 not out in One-Day Cup match against Essex at Scarborough last summer.
But he did not waste the opportunity to register his first in Championship cricket after resuming three not out on a pitch still favouring the batsmen.
Harry Gurney (3-90) dismissed Andrew Gale early for 13, but Pyrah kept Leaning company for two hours either side of lunch before he skied an attempted pull shot off Vernon Philander to mid-on.
Bresnan was in an aggressive mood, striking six fours, but his departure triggered Yorkshire's final decline as their last four wickets went down for just 19 runs.
Steven Mullaney was lbw to Matthew Fisher when Notts batted in the final session, but the teenager was denied a second wicket when Leaning dropped first-innings double centurion Alex Hales on nought.
However, Hales was soon caught behind off Bresnan for two, and Jack Brooks bowled Brendan Taylor (32), but a draw is the most likely result barring a dramatic final-day collapse by one of the sides.
Nottinghamshire bowler Samit Patel:
"I think the game is in the balance, it was unfortunate to lose those three wickets but that can happen in April conditions.
"I've worked hard on my bowling through the winter and adjusted a few things and now I am starting to feel like a spin bowler.
"I only took 20-odd wickets last season, so to have 13 already is very pleasing."
Yorkshire coach Jason Gillespie:
"We weren't at our best on the first day but I couldn't be more pleased at how we've gone on days two and three and to get those wickets towards the end of the day is a real bonus, going into the final day.
"I couldn't be more pleased for Jack Leaning. He works so hard on his game and deserves every reward he gets."
