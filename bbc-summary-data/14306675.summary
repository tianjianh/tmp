Betty, 24, made 136 appearances for the Pirates after joining as an academy player in 2005.
Pirates chief executive Rod Coward said: "It's always a case of mixed emotions when one of our better players leaves the club.
"We're pleased that Sam's abilities have been recognised and we wish him every success for his future at Worcester," he added.
The Warriors defeated the Pirates in the Championship final to win promotion to the Premiership at the end of last season.
