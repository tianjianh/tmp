Mourning celebrities: Platform 9 3/4, Brixton or a bar in LA?

Harry Potter fans have been paying their respects to late actor Alan Rickman by creating a memorial in his honour at platform 9 3/4.

Similar memorials have sprung up recently following the deaths of music legend David Bowie and Motorhead's Lemmy, with fans using social media to share their tributes from the sites.
Flowers, notes and scarves were left at the site at London's King's Cross Station hours after news of Alan Rickman's death broke.
The film and theatre actor, who died on Thursday, reached a new generation of devotees when he played Professor Severus Snape in the Harry Potter films.
Jon in London shared his photos. He says: "Harry Potter has been part of my childhood.
"I grew up with Harry, but Snape was always my favourite character. Alan brought him so brilliantly to life.
"I even have a Slytherin tattoo!
"It definitely feels a part of Snape has passed on with Alan and I wanted to mark it with a fitting tribute at King's Cross."
Claire in London: "I've been a fan from the start of the books, the films brought my imagination of the books to life.
"Alan Rickman was perfect as Snape. No-one would have been able to play him any better.
"I was passing the area and decided to go and take a moment to remember Alan Rickman and what he did for the Harry Potter world."
As every Harry Potter fan knows, platform 9 3/4 is where young wizards leave for Hogwarts. This fan didn't want to miss the chance to pay homage at the makeshift shrine.
It's not the first time fans have expressed their grief at the passing of a celebrity by gravitating to a spot that they are synonymous with.
When David Bowie died flowers began to appear at a mural in Brixton in London, the area where he was born.
Coralie Grassin from Hampshire shared her photo of a David Bowie mural on Facebook after paying her respects: "It was strange and very emotional. But there were also a lot of selfies being taken.
"The popularity of social media means you can share the moment with fans who aren't there.
"But it also feels like you have to prove your presence, to be 'trendy'.
"I watched a girl spend 10 minutes trying to photograph the red rose she was holding with the perfect background. First with her camera, then with her phone. By the time she was finished, there was no emotion left.  She threw the rose on the pile and left.
"Thankfully though some raw emotions do survive modern times."
Perhaps it is understandable that the death of a public figure triggers a public display of mourning.
In December, when British rock star Lemmy Kilmister lost his battle with cancer, devotees packed his favourite bar and grill, the Rainbow on Sunset Strip in Los Angeles in the US.
They placed flowers, cigarettes and bottles of Jack Daniel's on a makeshift shrine on the pavement outside the bar.
On the bar's patio, they signed their names and on a giant picture of him they wrote their tributes.
Joe Bagnato from Florida was one fan who travelled to the Rainbow. "There is no Motorhead unless Lemmy is behind that Rickenbacker bass," he said.
Following the death of Amy Winehouse in 2011, flowers and messages began appearing outside the singer's Camden home in London.
Today a permanent memorial stands in Camden so fans can continue to pay their respects.
Perhaps it was the death of Princess Diana that marked a shift in the way we mourn.
In 1997, when the "people's princess" died, thousands of individual moments of quiet reflection were demonstrated publicly.
Now the spread of the internet and increasing social media use allows us the freedom to easily share those expressions of our collective grief.
