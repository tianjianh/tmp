The 54-year-old man was arrested at Belfast International Airport on Monday morning.
Police said he was being questioned over a number of offences, including the four murders.
However, he was released later on Monday pending a report to the Public Prosecution Service.
The officers and nun were killed when a landmine, hidden in a culvert on the Killylea Road in Armagh, was detonated on 24 July 1990.
The victims were Sister Catherine Dunne, Constable William Hanson, Reserve Constable Joshua Willis and Reserve Constable David Sterrit.
A 55-year-old man arrested last week over the murders was later released pending a report to the Public Prosecution Service.
