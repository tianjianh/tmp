Derbyshire recorded their second win in three days as they opened their One-Day Cup campaign with a comfortable seven-wicket victory over Worcestershire.

Alexei Kervezee hit a stunning 77 in 50 balls as the hosts were bowled out for 295 in the last of their 50 overs.
But New Zealand international Hamish Rutherford (104) shared a second-wicket stand of 132 with Billy Godleman (61).
Wayne Madsen was then unbeaten on 69 as Derbyshire reached 298-3 with 11 balls to spare at New Road.
He shared an unbroken fourth-wicket stand of 104 with Neil Broom (45 not out) as the visitors posted their highest-ever score against Worcestershire in 54 seasons of one-day cricket.
After slumping to 17-2 following their decision to bat first, the hosts were rescued by Kervezee, who followed on from the form he showed in steering Worcestershire home with an unbeaten 52 in their T20 Blast win over Yorkshire.
Having put on 116 for the third wicket with Joe Clarke (44), Kervezee's efforts were then bolstered by 61 from Ross Whitley.
But Derbyshire's sequence of five defeats in six visits to New Road was ended thanks to their two century partnerships, with Rutherford proving particularly aggressive, hitting seven sixes in his 76-ball innings.
Their opening One-Day Cup win followed Friday night's T20 Blast win against Leicestershire, in the wake of the resignation of elite performance director Graeme Welch.
Worcestershire assistant coach Matt Mason:
"Obviously we are disappointed. The lads are very quiet in the dressing room. At the start of Derbyshire's innings, we thought we had enough runs.
"It was a tough wicket to score on, a bit two-paced and getting slower, but hats off to the Derbyshire lads. There were two great partnerships that killed us off.
"We just couldn't get the early breakthroughs to put them on the back foot and Hamish Rutherford's innings was fantastic."
Derbyshire century-maker Hamish Rutherford:
"It was nice to score some runs and contribute to a good team performance to get off in this competition in the right way.
"Worcestershire's total was maybe a touch light on what we thought par was but again the wicket was a touch slow and with variable bounce.
"I figure 300 on that was probably all right. As we showed, we took it deep and managed to get the runs."
