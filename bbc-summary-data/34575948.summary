Andy Charlton death: Neil Urwin 'should not have been on road'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man with a sleep disorder who knocked over a cyclist causing him fatal injuries, was warned by a medic the day before not to drive, a court has heard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Neil Urwin who suffers from obstructive sleep apnoea, "should not have been on the road" when he struck Andy Charlton in Northumberland on 9 August 2014.
The experienced cyclist, 43, from North Shields, suffered "catastrophic brain injuries" and died in hospital.
Newcastle Crown Court heard Mr Urwin's condition was interrupting his sleep.
The 56-year-old fork lift truck driver, from East Acres, Barrasford, sought advice from his GP months before the collision due to his night-time breathing from his sleep apnoea waking him up.
A specialist at the sleep clinic at Hexham General Hospital on 8 August, the day before the crash, told him he should not drive, the court heard.
The jury heard Mr Urwin was driving his Ford Fiesta on a straight section of the A6079 near Chollerford at 50-55mph when he hit the back of Mr Charlton's bike, sending him onto the bonnet, hitting the windscreen and over the back of the car.
Richard Bennett, prosecuting, said: "He should not have been on the road at all... the defendant was dangerously close for no good reason."
The section of the road gave the driver a 327m unrestricted view before the point of impact, and there were no skid marks on the road or signs of emergency braking before the crash, the court heard.
Mr Urwin told police he saw Mr Charlton two to three car lengths ahead of him. He could not explain why he had not spotted him before that moment, the court heard.
Mr Urwin has admitted causing death by careless driving but denies a charge of causing death by dangerous driving.
The trial continues.
