Celebrity injunction case: Supreme Court delays decision

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A decision over an injunction taken out by a celebrity to keep an extra-marital relationship out of the media will be announced at "a later date", the Supreme Court has said.

The celebrity - known in court as PJS - is appealing against an appeal court ruling lifting a ban on him being named in the media in England and Wales.
The Supreme Court said the hearing was over and it would reserve judgement.
An injunction granted by the Court of Appeal remained in force, it added.
Earlier this year, the Sun on Sunday wanted to publish an account of the man's alleged extra-marital activities, but he argued that he had a right to privacy and took legal action.
On Monday, three Court of Appeal judges ruled that the injunction should be lifted.
Lawyers for News Group Newspapers, publishers of the tabloid, had successfully argued that the ban should go because the man has been named in articles abroad and his identity could be found on the internet.
Supreme Court president Lord Neuberger announced at the conclusion of Thursday's legal argument that the court would "take time to consider this matter".
The panel of five justices would give their decision "as soon as we can", he added.
