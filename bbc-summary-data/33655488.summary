Cowes floating bridge passenger toll introduced

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Foot passengers and cyclists are now being charged to use the so-called floating bridge at Cowes on the Isle of Wight.

Fees were due to start last Monday, but a delay to install the new system and train staff meant charging had to be postponed.
The council said reintroducing charges was necessary to fund a new ferry and support the service.
But it has angered residents who formed a Facebook group to oppose the charges.
The 38-year-old chain ferry, which links Cowes and East Cowes, is being replaced by Isle of Wight Council next summer.
The chain ferry, which takes about two to three minutes to cross the river and means users avoid a 20-mile round trip, has provided free river crossings for pedestrians and cyclists since 1992.
An estimated one million foot passengers and cyclists use it each year.
Tolls for drivers currently range from Â£2.20 for cars to Â£7.60 for lorries. Pedestrians and cyclists will have to pay 40p return.
Once a smartcard system is introduced, non-smartcard holders will pay 70p. Travel is free for under-19s or bus pass holders.
The decision to charge pedestrians and cyclists was made in February.
