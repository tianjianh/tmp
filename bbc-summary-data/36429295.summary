Robson-Kanu is set to miss Wales' final warm-up game with Sweden due to a leg injury, but says he will be fit for Wales' opener on 11 June in Bordeaux.
He is joined on the sidelines by injured pair Joe Allen and Joe Ledley.
"I have a training schedule to build up for the Euros and I will be very good to go for the [Slovakia] game," Robson-Kanu told BBC Radio Wales Sport.
"I am feeling good in myself, I picked up a little knock but I am just managing it now," he continued.
"I am stepping up my training over the next few days. The aim is to be fit for that first game."
Manager Chris Coleman, who recently signed a new deal to remain national team coach, has dismissed concerns over the fitness of Gareth Bale who was just suffering from cramp at the end of the Champions League final.
Midfielder Emyr Huws and striker Wes Burns will travel to France with the Wales camp to provide cover for the injured players.
Former Reading striker Robson-Kanu, who is a free agent this summer, is hopeful all of Wales' injured players will be in contention to start the tournament, their first major finals appearance since 1958.
Meanwhile, Allen has been ruled out of the trip to Stockholm, while Ledley is still recovering from a fractured leg suffered on 7 May.
"We have got professionals on the medical team who advise us and direct us so we are good and fully fit for the tournament, so we will see how it goes," Robson-Kanu said.
"It is great to have Joe Ledley around, I think everyone was fearing the worst when we heard the news, but he has made a bit of a miraculous recovery and by the time the first game comes around, hopefully everyone is fully fit and ready to go."
The 27-year-old former Arsenal trainee says it will be a big error if Wales underestimate Slovakia, ahead of their hotly-anticipated meeting with Roy Hodgson's England, who face Russia in their opening Group B clash.
Slovakia are without top scorer Robert Vittek, but do have Premier League representation in Liverpool defender Martin Skrtel. Slovakia defeated world champions Germany in their latest warm-up before France.
"Every team here has qualified, there will be no mugs, there is going to be a lot of quality in the tournament," Robson-Kanu added, "Martin Skrtel is a top player, but we will be looking to expose their weaknesses and work on our strength.
"Walking out in the first game will be a special feeling but we feel 1-11 we are as strong as anyone."
