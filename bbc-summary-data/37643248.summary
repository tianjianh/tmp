A new comedy festival for Aberdeen is getting under way.

The inaugural event - which is running until 5 November - features scores of local, national and international comedians, with Tom Stade among the headliners for the opening night.
Created by Aberdeen Inspired and Breakneck Comedy, the festival is using more than 20 city centre venues.
There will also be events aimed at children, and comedy workshops.
It is hoped it will help put the Aberdeen comedy circuit on the map.
Organiser Naz Hussain told BBC Scotland: "People are really looking forward to the festival.
"It's something that will potentially grow into something really big."
