Danielle Jones said she "just screamed" when the singer turned up during the reception in Old Windsor in Berkshire on Friday.
He sang Take That's hit A Million Love Songs for the 33-year-old fan, before chatting to wedding guests.
Earlier this year the star tweeted he would be singing at the weddings of three fans during 2015.
Mrs Jones, from Bracknell, explained she and her husband had just had their first dance when her maid of honour, who had organised the stunt, led her to the surprise guest.
"He was stood immediately in front of me - I was nearly not breathing for quite a long time," she said.
Making his offer on Twitter in January, Barlow said he receives "thousands of requests" to sing at people's weddings.
Mrs Jones said she had tweeted him to invite him to her wedding, but had received a message saying he was out of the country on the day.
Photographer Gary Fielder said he had almost finished his day's work at the wedding when the "amazing" performance took place.
"He seemed a genuine guy - so happy to be making an impact for someone," he said.
