Pet has become famous in Ullapool, Ross-shire, for her dog-like antics.
She was adopted by collies after being taken in when  she struggled to survive following her birth in April last year.
One of a set of twins, she was born with a problem with her back legs and was taken into the warmth of the croft house to be looked after.
Pet instantly bonded with her fellow housemates and was 'adopted' by a sheep dog called Dice.
Check out this clip of the 10-month-old running and playing with a pack of collies.
