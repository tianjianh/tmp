Changes may have to be made to the rules surrounding the Shoreham Airshow following last month's fatal crash, an MP has said.

East Worthing and Shoreham MP Tim Loughton believes the type of aircraft allowed to carry out aerobatics needs to be looked at.
He led a debate on the crash and its implications for future air displays at Westminster Hall on Tuesday.
Eleven people died when a vintage jet crashed in to the A27 in West Sussex.
The Conservative MP said although a lot of work went into making air shows as safe as possible, the implications of the crash in Shoreham must be discussed.
"I think there will have to be some changes. We need to know exactly why the pilot was flying where he was, at that height, so close to the road.
"Do we just need to change the [flight] pattern, do we need not to have certain types of very powerful and also quite old vintage aircraft?
"Is it not suitable for those type of aircraft? I don't know."
He added: "People are keen not to rush to judgement. The Shoreham Airshow is a very popular part of the Shoreham calendar, it's been going very safely for the past 26 years and I hope we can retain it in some form."
Two days after the crash on 22 August, the Civil Aviation Authority banned vintage jets from performing high-energy aerobatics over land at air shows, limiting them to flypasts only.
It also grounded all Hawker Hunter jets until further notice.
An initial Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) report found the Hawker Hunter jet showed "no abnormal indications" during its flight.
It also said pilot Andy Hill was thrown clear of the aircraft during the later part of the crash but it was not clear whether he initiated his ejection.
The Royal Air Forces Association (RAFA), which organises Shoreham Airshow, said it continued to "provide the authorities with our full cooperation and support in their endeavours to find all the answers" to the "tragedy at Shoreham".
