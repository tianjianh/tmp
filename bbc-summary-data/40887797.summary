The 23-year-old has one year left on his contract but has failed to sign a new deal.
Koeman said last month Everton "100%" expected the England international to leave but the Toffees boss now appears to have softened his stance.
"If there's no interest he will be part of the team," said Koeman.
"He is training with Everton, he is part of the team and training in a good way."
Barkley came through the youth system at Everton and has played 150 times for the club in the Premier League, scoring 21 times, since making his debut six years ago.
Arsenal, Chelsea and Tottenham have all been linked with the player, who recently returned to training after missing most of pre-season training with a groin injury.
Everton want around Â£50m for Barkley but that figure could fall before the transfer window closes on 31 August as he would be a free agent in 12 months' time.
