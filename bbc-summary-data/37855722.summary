Catholic archbishop apologises over adoptions

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Archbishop of Westminster has apologised for the "hurt caused" by adoption agencies acting in the name of the Catholic Church.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Cardinal Vincent Nichols told an ITV documentary the practices of adoption agencies "reflected the social values at that time, and were sometimes lacking in care and sensitivity".
Lawyers have urged the home secretary to launch an inquiry into the issue.
One solicitor said women were entitled to have their experiences recognised.
More than half a million adoptions took place in the 30 years before a change in the law in 1976 gave local authorities responsibility for adoptions in Britain.
Prior to this, many adoptions involved babies born to young unmarried mothers, and voluntary organisations with religious connections often oversaw the adoptions.
Some of these young mothers have said they were pressured into giving up their babies for adoption.
In 1974, Diana was sent away from her home in London when, at 16, she became pregnant with her daughter.
"It was a very difficult time as the father had abandoned me," she told Radio 5 Live. "I pretended everything was OK and didn't tell anyone."
When her mother found out, she was sent away to a mother and baby unit outside the capital.
"I had not had any antenatal care so I really didn't know what to expect. It was both terrifying and heartbreaking."
In the 12 days Diana got to spend with her daughter, she was "actively discouraged" from helping care for her, whether it be picking her up, changing her or even feeding her.
"When I could, I fed her from a bottle as when I had been in hospital they gave me an injection to stop me lactating," she said. "It made the difference for me having those 12 days because I knew a little about her rather than nothing at all."
Diana then returned to London with her daughter before handing her over to the Church.
"That was the longest I had spent holding her, on that train journey back," she said. "When someone came out to take her, I was still in the mindset that they won't make me do this.
"But my mother took her from me, handed her to a stranger in a white coat and we went home."
Diana was reunited when her daughter turned 18 and the pair now have a relationship, but this did not solve all the problems.
"You never get the time you have missed back," she said. "We have a good relationship, but there are still hundreds of thousands who don't have the joy of a relationship with their child."
Speaking for the Roman Catholic Church in England and Wales, the cardinal said that the Church "understands and acknowledges the grief and pain caused by the giving up of a child through adoption".
His apology will be shown in an ITV documentary entitled Britain's Adoption Scandal: Breaking The Silence.
It features women who speak about their experience of having their babies adopted through the Catholic Church, the Church of England and the Salvation Army among other organisations.
The cardinal's comments come as lawyers prepare a case calling for the launch of a public inquiry.
Carolynn Gallwey from Bhatt Murphy Solicitors said: "These women were told not to speak about what had happened to them.
"But now they are entitled to have their experiences recognised and the only way to do that is through a public inquiry."
The Home Office has not commented so far.
