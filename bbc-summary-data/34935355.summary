Broadmoor worker jailed for selling stories to tabloid

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A former Broadmoor Hospital worker who sold stories about patients to the Sun has been jailed for eight months.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Robert Neave, 62, had worked at the top security psychiatric hospital in Berkshire since 1980.
The healthcare nursing assistant from Liverpool contacted the newspaper in September 2007 to offer information about Yorkshire Ripper Peter Sutcliffe and other patients.
Judge Richard Marks QC said his actions were a "gross breach of trust".
Neave also passed on information about Robert Napper, who killed Rachel Nickell on Wimbledon Common in 1992.
Sutcliffe, a former Bradford lorry driver, received 20 life sentences in 1981 for murdering 13 women and attempting to murder seven others.
After his initial contact, Neave passed on 14 tips to the newspaper over the next two and a quarter years and was paid a total of Â£7,125.
He pleaded guilty in November 2013 to conspiracy to commit misconduct in a public office, and was sentenced at the Old Bailey on Thursday.
Judge Marks said the articles written as a result of Neave's tip-offs "caused mistrust and suspicion as well as potentially impacting on security".
He added: "Your duty of confidentiality was something you were well aware of. Accordingly it is difficult to see there can be any excuse at all for what you did. It does appear you must have been motivated by money."
The Common Serjeant of London said the sentence was "significantly" reduced after taking into account the long delay in sentencing and the fact that Neave is the sole carer for his elderly father.
But he said: "I regret to say that in my judgment the scope and scale of your offending was such that an immediate custodial sentence is inevitable."
'Not a whistleblower'
The case was part of Operation Elveden, the Met Police investigation into alleged corrupt payments to public officials.
Speaking after the sentencing, Det Supt Larry Smith, leading on Operation Elveden, said Neave had been in a "highly trusted position".
"He was not a whistleblower but released private information, obtained in the course of his duties for financial gain."
