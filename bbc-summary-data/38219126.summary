Aberystwyth street signs sold at auction for £15,000

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Between £15,000 and £20,000 has been raised from the auction of old Aberystwyth street signs, which were replaced with Edwardian-style versions.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
About 150 people attended the auction at The Coliseum, Ceredigion Museum, as more than 200 signs went under the hammer.
Chalybeate Street raised the most, with an estate agent paying £500.
The signs were replaced as part of an £800,000 scheme to improve the look of the Welsh seaside town.
The exact figure raised will be counted and confirmed by the Friends of Ceredigion Museum group on Tuesday.
