The programme was filmed in a reconstruction of a 1700s township at the Highland Folk Museum in Newtonmore.
The museum's Outlander Day on 5 September will hold demonstrations of weaving, cooking and wood turning as well as talks about the period.
There will also be a reconstruction of a British Army red coats' camp.
