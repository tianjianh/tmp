More police officers have been tasked with catching speeding drivers in the Highlands.

Thirty-eight officers cover road policing duties compared to 12 officers three to four years ago.
Ch Supt Julian Innes, the area's divisional commander, said the move had led to an increase in detection rates.
Between April and October 3,755 motorists were detected breaking speed limits - a 40% rise on the same period last year.
Ch Supt Innes said: "That increase has nothing to do with speed cameras on the A9, or camera vans or any of the activity they do.
"We have increased the number of officers that have their dedicated time to road policing."
He said having more officers meant Police Scotland could improve its response to community concerns about speeding.
The senior officer added: "We are catching more folk."
