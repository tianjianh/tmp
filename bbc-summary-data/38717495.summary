Morecambe: Joseph Cala ends potential takeover talks

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Italian businessman Joseph Cala has ended his interest in taking over League Two side Morecambe, BBC Radio Lancashire reports.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Cala visited the club last week about a possible deal but chairman Peter McGuigan says it will not take place.
Cala had previously showed interest in buying Portsmouth in 2012.
The Shrimps have faced financial problems since Diego Lemos took over the club in September and they are currently under a transfer embargo.
