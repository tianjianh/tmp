Priest Fr Patrick Conway gives thief in wardrobe lift into town

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A County Clare priest has been labelled a good Samaritan after giving a burglar he found only minutes earlier in his wardrobe a lift into a nearby town.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Fr Patrick Conway found Michael Clune hiding in a room in his home in Ennis on 7 December.
The burglar initially denied breaking into Fr Conway's house and stealing 20 euros.
It was only after he gave the money back that the priest drove him into Ennis.
Fr Conway, an assistant priest in Ennis parish, had just returned from a doctor's appointment when he noticed a downstairs window had been broken.
When he went into his study to call the police, he found Clune hiding in a wardrobe.
He said it came as a shock when he realised it was someone he had known for a number of years.
"I had known Michael since he was a young lad and knew his family well," he said.
The priest confronted Clune about the concrete block that had been thrown through the window but he denied any involvement in the break-in.
Fr Conway then realised 20 euros that he had left out was missing. Again, Clune continued to deny taking the money.
"I had left 20 euros on the floor to remind myself to give it back to someone who had given it to me," he said.
"I said, 'why did you take my money? Give it back' and he said 'I didn't take your money'.
"I was absolutely certain the money was there, so I said 'either you give back my money or we go to the Garda (Irish police)'."
When that failed to work, Fr Conway offered to give him a lift into town.
"I said 'you give me back my money and I'll take you down town'. 'I won't take you to the gardai'. 'I'll bring you over to the cathedral' where another priest had been helping him.
"So he found the money somewhere then and gave it back to me."
On the drive into town, the burglar asked the priest to buy him methadone, which he refused.
When he brought Clune into town, the priest was not at the cathedral so Clune got out of the car.
After consulting with a fellow priest, Fr Conway reported what had happened to police.
Clune pleaded guilty to the burglary and was given an eight-month suspended jail term consecutive to the eight months in jail he is currently serving.
Fr Conway said he had had no contact with the man since the incident, but hoped he was receiving treatment for his addiction in jail.
