Christina McCallion, who lives in Curragh Walk, said she now wants security gates erected to help deal with anti-social behaviour in the area.
She said that she cannot let her children out to play in the garden.
A spokesperson for the council said funding has been approved for gates at three locations in the Shantallow area.
Christina has moved her children to a different bedroom because of what she says is anti-social behaviour at night in the area.
"We all live in fear after the fire at the weekend in case it happens to one of us.
"They have been pulling down my back fence and have had rubbish thrown into my back yard.
"The security gates will keep them from the alley and away from houses in this area."
