[SN]TITLE[SN]
Third opposition politician barred in Venezuela

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A former Venezuelan state governor, Pablo Perez, says he has been barred from holding public office for 10 years.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Mr Perez is the third opposition politician to be disqualified in the past week.
The state prosecutor's office barred a former congresswoman, Maria Corina Machado, and a former mayor, Vicencio (Enzo) Scarano for 12 months.
Both were expected to run in December's parliamentary elections.
Mr Perez was not running for parliament.
It was not clear on what grounds he was barred, but he was given 15 days to appeal against the decision.
"Another attack against democratic dissidence", he wrote on social media.
The opposition says the government of President Nicolas Maduro is clamping down on the opposition ahead of December's elections.
Opinion polls have suggested the government could lose the vote.
The state prosecutor's office has in the past barred politicians from office for alleged corruption or lack of full disclosure in their wealth declarations.
