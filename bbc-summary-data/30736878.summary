BBC's Democracy Day: Dissent, discussion, debate

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
This year sees the 750th anniversary of the first Westminster Parliament and 800 years since the sealing of Magna Carta.

Many events will be held across the UK to commemorate these landmark moments, which underpinned the establishment of parliamentary democracy and the legal system in the UK and around the world.
Protests, dissent, discussion and debate are an integral part of democracy around the world - from Martin Luther King Jr leading the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom in 1963 to the recent JeSuisCharlie rallies in Paris and around the world where millions took part in unity marches.
In collaboration with the House of Commons and the House of Lords, the BBC will broadcast a special Democracy Day on Tuesday 20 January.
There will be live events, discussions and debate inside Westminster and at the BBC Radio Theatre in London broadcast across the BBC, including on all 27 BBC language services.
Across radio, TV and online, the BBC will look at democracy past and present, how democratic we really are, and encourage debate about the future of democracy.
