Todd Carney and Pat Richards: Injuries end Catalans Dragons duo's seasons

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Catalans Dragons winger Pat Richards has played his last game of rugby league, after a knee injury ended any further involvement in his last season.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Richards, 34, is retiring at the end of the campaign and will leave the Dragons with nine tries in 21 games.
The former Wests Tigers and Wigan player won Grand Finals in both Super League and the NRL.
Carney, 30, will play no further part this term after he sustained knee ligament damage in a loss at St Helens.
Former Australia and New South Wales half-back Carney has already had groin, rib, pectoral and calf injuries during his time in Perpignan.
Losing both players could prove a crucial blow to Catalans' hopes of a top-four place, with prop Antoni Maria also unavailable for the rest of the year.
Head coach Laurent Frayssinous is also without winger Jodie Broughton, who has a quad injury, for two weeks and back-rower Justin Horo, who faces three weeks out with an ankle problem.
