Former Charlton man Mark Hudson scored the first with a thumping header before Nahki Wells turned in his fifth in as many games from close range.
Jamie Paterson drilled in from 20 yards after the break before Duane Holmes' deflected effort and Jason Davidson's tap-in completed the rout.
Reza Ghoochannejhad was sent off at the end of a miserable night for Charlton.

The substitute picked up two yellow cards in a little over a minute, as his frustrations at chasing the hosts' slick passing and clever movement got the better of him.
Huddersfield have won five of their last eight league matches.
Meanwhile the Addicks, three points and two places short of safety, travel to third-placed Hull on Saturday in need of a win.
Huddersfield boss David Wagner:
"I'm happy of course, but it wasn't an easy game. After the game it seems easier than it was.
"It was our biggest win and another clean sheet and the first time we scored five goals in a game.
"We have had games where we played better, for example against Middlesbrough, a game that we lost. But to be honest it was the first time we played against an opponent who stood so deep in their own half.
"The boys created some good moments, but against a side which does this we must find some better solutions, not just rely on set-pieces to score the first and second goal.
Charlton goalkeeper Steven Henderson:
"As you can imagine I think the lads are lower than they have ever been in their careers right now.
"I feel numb and a few players are unable to speak. It's a position I've not been in before and that's all I can say.
"It's embarrassing really, we didn't have our first shot until the 92nd minute.
"I'd like to apologise to our travelling fans. I know they think I won't mean it, but the real fans will know I genuinely want to apologise for that shocking performance."
