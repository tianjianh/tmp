Police plea over Lowestoft 1981 'body in sea' case

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An incident in which a body was found at sea by fishermen more than 30 years ago and immediately returned to the water is being investigated by police.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
In July 1981, a ship was trawling off the coast of Lowestoft, Suffolk, when its crew recovered a body.
For reasons unknown, the body was put back into the sea but authorities were alerted. The body was never seen again.
Norfolk and Suffolk Joint Major Investigation Team are appealing for information over missing persons.
They believe the body could have been that of a missing person who disappeared in Norfolk earlier that year.
The cold case is being reviewed as part of Operation Mouldsworth, which is looking into all missing people from Norfolk and Suffolk.
The ship, Boston Sea Stallion, was owned by a deep sea fishing company.
Det Con Gary Fisher said:  "There is no suggestion that the crew had, in any way, behaved inappropriately.
"However, I would still like to speak to anyone who may remember the incident and may be able to help with the identification of the body."
