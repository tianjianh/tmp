The Lego Movie made £34.3m, while the final Hobbit instalment took £33.5m.
Overall takings exceeded £1.1bn for the fifth year running, though the 2.9% drop on 2013 was the biggest fall since box office tracking began in 1991.
The Wolf of Wall Street fell outside the top 10 but still took £22.7m, the most ever taken by an 18-rated title.
Despicable Me 2 took the top spot in 2013 with takings of £47.4m, while Les Miserables came in second with £40.7m.
The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies, which is still on release, is expected to overtake The Lego Movie in the next few weeks.
This year is expected to bring in bigger box office receipts than 2014, with new instalments in the James Bond, Star Wars and Avengers series tipped to pull in the crowds.
Family films due for release include Peppa Pig, Despicable Me spin-off Minions and Snoopy and Charlie Brown: The Peanuts Movie.
The biggest British film of the year was The Inbetweeners 2, which gave the box office a much needed boost last summer following the World Cup in Brazil.
The TV comedy spin-off took £33.3m, which also made it the third biggest film overall.
Paddington was the second biggest British film of 2014. Still on release, the big-screen vehicle for the popular children's character has taken £27.9m to date.
