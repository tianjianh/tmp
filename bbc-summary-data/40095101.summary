German police have arrested a 51-year-old man after a crate of grenades from World War Two blew up in his garage.

Police were called to the address in Hennef, western Germany, on Monday after an explosion was reported.
Firefighters arrived to find the man's garage in flames and more ammunition went off as they tried to put it out.
The owner, a private collector, said he had bought the munitions at a flea market.
Reports suggest the force of the explosions threw objects up to 10m (32ft) into the air.
No injuries were reported, but homes near the scene were quickly evacuated.
The nearby Highway 560 and a stretch of railway were both closed as bomb experts feared more munitions could go off.
Experts were called to secure the remaining grenades and destroy them via a controlled explosion in a field.
German media quoted police as saying the grenades had probably been triggered by unseasonably warm temperatures.
The collector now faces possible weapons charges over the incident.
