The 2014 Ryder Cup winner says he has been troubled by the problem since last May, when he was forced to pull out of the PGA Championship at Wentworth.
Gallacher will have his arm in a sling for 10 days.
The 41-year-old, who is 47th in the 2016 Ryder Cup qualifying standings, hopes to return to action in the Spanish Open at Valderrama in April.
Gallacher said the injury had hindered him "on the course, on the practice range and also in the gym".
