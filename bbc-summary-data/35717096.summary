The attack on Carter's Country gun store happened at around 04:30 local time and lasted just two minutes, police said.
The CCTV footage shows the gang pull off the metal security doors using a chain attached to a pick-up truck.
The robbers then dash in, grabbing weapons from glass cases and racks and stuffing them into bags.
