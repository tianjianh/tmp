No one in the house was injured but the car damaged black railings, brickwork and some possessions inside the house in Long Leys Road, in Lincoln.
Lincolnshire Police were called to the house at about 02:00 GMT but the driver of the car had left the scene.
A 24-year-old man was arrested later on Friday, on suspicion of driving while unfit through drink or drugs.
Police said the man, who was suffering from minor injuries and was arrested elsewhere in the city, remained in custody.
One nearby resident, who did not want to be named, told the Lincolnshire Echo the people in the house "had a pretty lucky escape".
Lincolnshire Fire and Rescue said firefighters made the vehicle safe, mopped up some fluid on the road and handed over to the council building inspector.
