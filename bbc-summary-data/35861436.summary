Norfolk ex-youth leader Henry Day MBE jailed for sex assaults

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A former youth leader who was appointed an MBE for his work with children has been jailed for a series of sex assaults, some nearly 50 years ago.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Henry Day, 76, of Norfolk attacked four boys, all aged under 16 at the time, between 1969 and 1986.
Day, already serving 13 years for 21 similar offences, was jailed for three years to run concurrently after admitting seven offences.
The defendant, of North Walsham, ran summer camps from 1973 to 1995.
Day, also known as Harry, was originally convicted in 2009 of 20 sexual offences, including gross indecency and incitement, against eight boys.

Det Con Mark Stratford said Day, who has now been convicted of sexually assaulting 12 boys, "preyed" on the children - the youngest of whom was nine years old at the time - "for his own sexual gratification".
"This was a terrible crime committed against children, many of whom relied on Day for support and to provide a positive future for them.
"Day took advantage of his position and abused the trust of many, including parents," he said.
Speaking after his original sentencing in 2009, Norfolk Police said they believed Day may have abused generations of young people who had not yet come forward.
Sentencing him for the new offences, Judge Anthony Bate said: "Until 2009, you were without conviction but in fact it was revealed you had been offending against young boys since the 1970s.
"These new matters have slowly emerged subsequently."
The new sentence will run alongside Day's previous term but, because he had been close to release from HMP Bure, Norfolk, it will mean he serves longer in prison, the judge said.
"This was a terrible crime committed against children, many of who relied on Day for support and to provide a positive future for them," he said.
"Day took advantage of his position and abused the trust of many, including parents."
Day set up his own charity in the 1950s through which he ran the summer camps in Hemsby.
The Young Citizens' Guild was intended to help young people grow in confidence and in 2004 he was appointed an MBE.
