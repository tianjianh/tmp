The English pairing of Judd Trump and Barry Hawkins topped Group C and come up against Mark Allen and Joe Swail, runners-up in Group D, in Wuxi.
Group A winners Wales, with Mark Williams and Ryan Day, play Group B runners-up China A, who have Ding Junhui and Liang Wenbo in their team.
Holders China B against Belgium and Thailand v Iran complete the line-up.
At the previous event in 2015, teenage Chinese duo Zhou Yuelong and Yan Bingtao, now 17 and 19 respectively, shocked Scotland's former world champion John Higgins and Stephen Maguire to claim the title.
This year, the Scots, who had Anthony McGill in place of Maguire, failed to reach the knockout stages after finishing third in Group D.
