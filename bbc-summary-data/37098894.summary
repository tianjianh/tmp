The work is in the style of comic book hero Roy of the Rovers.
The Foxes shocked English football's top flight with their 5,000-1 success in May.
City mayor Sir Peter Soulsby said he particularly liked the mural because Leicester's story would not have been out of place in the comic.
Other murals round the city have celebrated manager Claudio Ranieri, the club's fans and the atmosphere at King Power Stadium.
Work has begun on the fifth mural which will showcase the Thai heritage of the club's owners.

The six installations have been commissioned by Leicester City Council.
The mayor said: "These murals and wall paintings have been very, very well received and are a very appropriate way to celebrate.
"This one is particularly good because throughout the last season of Leicester City, people were saying this is real Roy of the Rovers stuff."
The mural can be seen on East Bond Street behind the Highcross Shopping Centre.
The other completed works are on walls in St Nicholas Circle, Burnmoor Street and Tudor Road.
