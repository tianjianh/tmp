Sam Warburton backs Warren Gatland as 2017 Lions coach

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Wales captain Sam Warburton has backed Warren Gatland being named 2017 British and Irish Lions coach to New Zealand.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Warburton was captain as Gatland guided the 2013 Lions to a 2-1 series win over Australia. Gatland was forwards coach as the 2009 Lions lost 2-1 in South Africa.
Flanker Warburton said: "He brings experience and the fact that he's been on a winning Lions tour already."
Robert Howley is expected deputise for Gatland during 2016-17.
Warburton believes Gatland "has a head start" for the Lions role because of his presence on their past two tours.
"They were extremely unlucky not to do a bit better out in South Africa," said the Cardiff Blues player.
"So I think the one thing when I was on the Lions tour in 2013 was making sure everybody - this is what we were told as players - you appreciate the jersey and the history of the jersey.
"And I think Warren has got a bit of a head start from that point of view, having had two tours under his belt already."
