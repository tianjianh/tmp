Mind of Mine knocked Adele's 25 from the top spot, with just over 4,000 more sales.
The former One Direction singer told the Offcial Charts Company it was "mind blowing".
"I can't believe that I have managed to achieve this as a solo artist.
"I am very proud coming from Bradford achieving this in my home country. "
He added: "It's mind-blowing to me. I don't take the support I have received for granted. My life at 23 could have been very different."
The album's lead single, Pillowtalk, went straight to number one in February.
Also entering the top five of the album chart are Joe Bonamassa at three with his collection Blues of Desperation and Birdy's Beautiful Lies at four - the 19-year-old's highest charting album.
At five is Justin Bieber's Purpose, which has now spent 20 consecutive weeks in the top five.
New entries include British metal band Asking Alexandria at 15 with The Black - their highest chart placing, and Swedish metal band Amon Amarth at 30 with Jomsviking.
In the singles chart, Mike Posner remains at number one for a third week with I Took A Pill In Ibiza.
The track had 84,000 combined sales, up on last week's 82,000, taking the song to Gold certification for passing the 400,000 combined sales mark.
It is also the most streamed song of the week, with just over 4.2 million plays.
The American singer told the Official Chart Company it was "quite an honour" to be number one in the UK.
"I appreciate you making sure I don't have to get another job, and can do art full-time, and that's pretty cool."
Fifth Harmony moved up to second place with Work From Home - a career best for the former X Factor USA contenders.
Lukas Graham's 7 Years moved down to third place in its eighth week in the top three.
The Danish band's self-titled album is being released this week.
Sia moved up four places to number four with Cheap Thrills, her highest chart placing for her as a lead artist.
Norwegian producer Alan Walker climbs seven places to number 11 with Faded.
The 18-year-old is number one this week in the Official Trending Chart - the list of songs making a big impact in the UK.
