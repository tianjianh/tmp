Rodney Parade: Drainage work begins after matches are washed out

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Work has started to improve drainage at Rodney Parade after the postponement of two Newport County matches this season.

The ground is used by League Two club County, Newport Gwent Dragons and Newport RFC, who own the ground.
A statement by the owners said the decision to insert a new 50 metre drainage pipe was made after Newport County's match with Stevenage was washed out on 1 October.
That followed the abandonment of a game against Barnet on 3 September.
The next match due to be played at at the ground is a European Rugby Challenge Cup game between the Dragons and Brive on 14 October.
"This is the earliest opportunity that we have to complete the work as it is our longest match-free window," said Mark Jones, Head of Operations at Rodney Parade.
"We certainly feel that the work is going to help the problems we have with postponements whilst it is also something that we can add to in the future.
"Once the season is completed we will then look to put in a brand new drainage system."
