[SN]TITLE[SN]
AFC Wimbledon 0-0 Oldham Athletic

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
AFC Wimbledon's goal drought extended to a sixth straight game as they rounded off their campaign with a goalless draw at home to Oldham.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Neal Ardley's mid-table side bossed the first half but could not find a way through, with Lyle Taylor heading against a post and Andy Barcham forcing Oldham skipper Peter Clarke into a superb clearance on his own line.
Ben Reeves fired in an effort that deflected narrowly wide and former Oldham man Dominic Poleon hit a shot too close to visiting goalkeeper Connor Ripley, while at the other end, Tope Obadeyi's angled drive was tipped over by James Shea.
Oldham improved in the second half and could have gone in front through Ryan Flynn, but when one-on-one with Shea, the ball stuck under his feet and the shot was smothered by the goalkeeper.
Oldham forward Michael Ngoo scuffed a volley wide when a truer connection to the cross would have put the visitors in front.
Taylor forced Ripley into a flying save with a 20-yard free-kick and Oldham's Josh Law struck an effort that flew only a foot over late on as the spoils were shared.
