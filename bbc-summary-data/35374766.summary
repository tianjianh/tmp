[SN]TITLE[SN]
Case against Channel Tunnel walker to go ahead

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Prosecutors are to press ahead with their case against a Sudanese man granted asylum in Britain after walking through the Channel Tunnel from France.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Abdul Rahman Haroun, 40, was granted asylum on Christmas Eve after being found inside the tunnel on 4 August.
He denies a charge of causing an obstruction to an engine or carriage.
Canterbury Crown Court bailed Mr Haroun until 3 March, when it will consider legal argument. A provisional trial date has been set for 20 June.
Mr Haroun was found near the end of the 31-mile Channel Tunnel at Folkestone, Kent.
In a separate case two other men arrested after walking through the Channel Tunnel also appeared at the same court.
Iranians Payam Moradi Mirahessari, 25, and Farein Vahdani, 20, both pleaded not guilty to obstructing an engine or carriage using the railway last October.
The pair were remanded in custody for legal argument on 4 March.
A trial date was set for 4 April.
