Pro12: Benetton Treviso 28-35 Glasgow Warriors

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Rory Clegg's 76th-minute try snatched a 35-28 bonus-point victory for Glasgow Warriors over Treviso in Italy.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Luca Sperandio's try broke the deadlock for the hosts, before Stuart Hogg, Tommy Seymour and Adam Ashe all touched down for Glasgow.
Dean Budd pounced on a Warriors error to score, but Nick Grigg bagged the visitors' fourth try.
Tommaso Allan's boot kept Treviso in touch, and Budd plunged over again to tie the scores before Clegg's clincher.
The hosts capitalised on a period of slack Glasgow to open the scoring, Sperandio sniping through the tackles of Ryan Wilson and Henry Pyrgos, with Allan pulling the conversion attempt wide.
Just 12 minutes later, however, the fly-half's grubber kick bounced straight into the arms of opposite number Hogg, wearing 10 for Glasgow for the first time, and the Scotland international scampered some 80 metres to score.
The Warriors struck again almost immediately, the Pro12's top try-scorer, Seymour, bagging his eighth of the season as he finished off a fine move started by full-back Peter Murchie to touch down under the posts.
Hogg converted both tries, and Allan sent what ought to have been a straightforward penalty attempt flying wide from in front of the posts.
Ashe swatted aside Treviso's number eight, Alberto De Marchi, to score Glasgow's third, Hogg again accurate from the tee.
But the flanker played his part in gifting the hosts seven points of their own, when he flung a wayward pass into his own in-goal area, the bounce evaded Murchie, and Budd leapt on the loose ball to score, Allan converting.
The fly-half knocked over a penalty with the final act of the half to keep Treviso within a score.
Allan skewed another effort wide two minutes after the break, but did land his second successful penalty to move the Italians within three points of Glasgow.
Centre Grigg, though, showed brilliant dynamism to power through three tackles and secure the Warriors' bonus-point try, Hogg converting once more.
Again, Allan kept Treviso in touch with his boot, slotting a third penalty.
And after a period of sustained pressure, the hosts drew level with six minutes to play, as Budd again dived over from a quick tap-penalty under the posts, with replacement Ian McKinley converting.
But from the restart, Glasgow won turnover ball in their own half and swept forward, Sean Lamont breaking the line and finding Seymour, who jinked inside, and offloaded to Clegg.
The replacement beat the last man and scrambled over the whitewash, Hogg adding the extras.
