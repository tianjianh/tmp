Police stopped a driver after a rolled-up carpet was seen protruding about 2.5m (8ft) from the back of a van, causing one officer to "completely lose his sense of humour".

Hertfordshire Police tweeted to joke about the incident.
The officer had already helped to stop nearly 400 vehicles in one day near Bishop's Stortford.
Having ensured the load was safe, he finished his shift and left to "search for his sense of humour".
The illegally-loaded van was one of 391 vehicles pulled over during a one-day multi-agency operation on Tuesday.

A number of motoring offences were identified in the crackdown.
During the day police tweeted that Sgt Duncan Wallace "wasn't impressed" when he found a bald tyre, "especially with the cold weather conditions".
Shortly afterwards he came across the protruding carpet, and his colleagues wrote on Twitter: "At this point Sgt Wallace... completely lost his sense of humour."
The driver of the van was "reported for contravening the Road Vehicles (Construction and Use) Regulations 1986 and was not allowed to leave the location until he made the load safe", a Hertfordshire Police spokeswoman said.
Sgt Wallace thanked motorists for their patience and said the "vast majority" were "law-abiding" and fully supported such police operations.
