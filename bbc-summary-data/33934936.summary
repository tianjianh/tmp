Scottish Borders Council and Stirling-based Ramoyle Developments have concluded missives for the former Burgh Yard.
It will be used for a "mixed use" commercial scheme including some flats and possibly a pub/restaurant.
It used to house a petrol station, garages and workshops.
Council leader David Parker said: "There has been a great deal of interest surrounding the former Burgh Yard site, and I am delighted that the sale has now been agreed.
"If it goes ahead as planned, this development should bring a significant benefit to Galashiels at an exciting time, with the Borders Railway opening in less than one month.
"I look forward to seeing it enhance the facilities in the town for visitors and the local community."
Councillor Stuart Bell said the move could bring the site near the recently-opened transport interchange back into use.
"If the scheme comes to fruition, it will bring investment in our region, create new jobs and provide improved facilities for tourists, tying into the key aims of the Borders Railway Blueprint programme," he said.
Jim Turnbull, of Ramoyle Developments, added: "We are very pleased to be able to add this prestigious project to our currently expanding development programme.
"Several operators have approached us with regards to the various commercial uses we have in mind for Galashiels and we expect to be able to reveal our preferred line-up soon."
