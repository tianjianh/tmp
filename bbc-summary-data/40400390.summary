Centre Nick Grigg said making his Scotland debut fulfilled a boyhood dream but he admitted he barely touched the ball in the loss to Fiji in Suva.

Scotland went down 27-22 on Saturday to the impressive hosts as they failed to build on the momentum of the thrilling victory over Australia in Sydney.
"I touched the ball three or four times," said Grigg, 24.
"I enjoy running with the ball so I would like to have got a bit more ball but it turned into quite a messy game."
Scotland captain John Barclay said the wet conditions in Fiji meant the ball was "like a bar of soap" and he highlighted a range of areas where the team did not perform well enough - in turnovers, in conceding penalties, a lack of accuracy and poor passing.
"Fiji came out firing and physicality won the game," Grigg told BBC Scotland.
"There were a few big tackles, a few big hits. It took me back to club rugby days in Wellington when there would be a few big hits and people on the sidelines would be whooping and cheering.
"They surprised us with their kicking game. They kicked a lot more than we expected them to.
"We didn't get into our phase attack; our structure went out the window. We had a couple of phases and then we'd lose the ball or they'd send numbers into the rucks and we'd lose the ball that way.
"We weren't able to get into our rhythm and we weren't able to play our shape. We're a team that likes to play quick ball and we weren't able to achieve that."
The New Zealand-born Glasgow Warriors centre, who qualifies for Scotland through his Ayrshire grandfather, admitted to "good nerves" in the team hotel ahead of winning his first Scotland cap.
And he said of his debut: "I thought it was amazing. Ever since I was a child I've wanted to play international rugby and I couldn't ask for a better team and management."
