A Care Quality Commission (CQC) report in 2015 raised serious concerns about dirty ambulances and out of date lifesaving equipment.
It also highlighted concerns in relation to equipment checks and maintenance.
The CQC has now rated the service as good.

During the previous inspection, officials found infection control practices were not always followed by staff and procedures for the disposal of clinical waste was concerning.
A large number of ambulances were found to be dirty on the outside and the general cleanliness inside was highlighted as a problem.
Life-saving equipment used by paramedics for major disasters was also out of date.
However, after the latest inspection in September the chief inspector of Hospitals, Sir Mike Richards, said: "The Yorkshire Ambulance Service NHS Trust faced real challenges, which were apparent at our previous inspection.
"Although we found a caring organisation in 2015, we told the trust it must improve the safety, effectiveness, and responsiveness of the service it was providing to the people of Yorkshire."
"Since then, the trust, has worked hard to address the issues we raised," he added.
Yorkshire Ambulance Service serves five million people in East Yorkshire, North Yorkshire, South Yorkshire and West Yorkshire.
Rod Barnes, chief executive of Yorkshire Ambulance Service NHS Trust, said: "All of our services demonstrated significant improvement since the CQC's inspection in January 2015.
"We do recognise, however, that there is always more we can do to improve."
