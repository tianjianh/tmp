Fiona MacKeown has written to Indian prime minister Narendra Modi after two men were cleared of raping and killing the 15-year-old in Goa.
A first post-mortem examination ruled that Scarlett had accidentally drowned.
But after a campaign by her family, a second post mortem revealed she had been drugged and raped.

Traces of cocaine, ecstasy and LSD were found in her system.
Scarlett, from Bideford in Devon, suffered 50 separate injuries in the attack, the court in India was told..
Ms MacKeown told ITV 1's Good Morning Britain: "I'd like a reinvestigation, I'd like the police investigated that lied to me and told the other younger policeman to treat it as an accident and not a murder.
"I'd like the ministers who delayed the handing over to the CBI (the Central Bureau of Investigation, India's elite national police agency) investigated and then maybe we might get to the bottom of it.
"That's my biggest wish, a new investigation."
Scarlett had been in the country on a family holiday at the time of her killing, but attended a Valentine's Day beach party while the rest of her relatives went travelling.
Ms MacKeown alleged that the investigative process was initially hindered by a reluctance in the Indian criminal justice system to admit a tourist had been murdered.
She also spoke of how she would "regret for the rest of my life" the decision to allow her daughter to go to the beach party alone.
