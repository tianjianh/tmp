[SN]TITLE[SN]
Aldershot Town 2-2 Barrow

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Nine-man Barrow fought back from two goals down to salvage a draw at Aldershot in a pulsating encounter.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Bluebirds' situation looked hopeless deep into injury time, but substitute Ross Hannah unleashed a 25-yard free-kick that silenced a stunned Recreation Ground.
It had all looked so promising for the Shots when Matt McClure gave them a sensational first-minute lead. Will Evans made it 2-0 as they dominated the first half.
However Barrow's Shaun Tuton went on an inspirational run on 73 minutes, breaking over halfway, beating three men and finishing beautifully.
The visitors lost their discipline late on, as both Shaun Beeley and Nick Anderton were sent off for double bookings. But incredibly the late wonder goal saved a point.
