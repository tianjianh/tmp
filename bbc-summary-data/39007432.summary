Six Nations: Scotland's Josh Strauss ruled out of rest of campaign

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Scotland number eight Josh Strauss has been ruled out of the rest of the Six Nations campaign through injury.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
It represents a second injury blow for the Scots after captain Greig Laidlaw was also ruled out of the remainder of the championship.
Strauss, 30, suffered a kidney injury during the 22-16 defeat by France.
Strauss will now return to Glasgow Warriors for further care and a review of the injury will be scheduled in approximately six weeks' time.
"After completing the [French] match, he was scanned in Paris," said Scottish Rugby. "Both the scan, and the player, were reviewed back in Scotland, where the full extent of the injury was confirmed."
Gloucester scrum-half Laidlaw left the Stade de France on crutches on Sunday following an ankle injury. Scottish Rugby confirmed the 58-time capped player sustained ligament damage.

Laidlaw was replaced by Glasgow's Ali Price in Paris. John Barclay, who took over as captain, also departed with a head knock before half-time, only for his replacement John Hardie to suffer the same fate early in the second half.
