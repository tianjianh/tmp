The Beechcraft King Air 200 came down in a field off Gravel Lane and Miller's Lane in Chigwell just before 10:20 BST and burst into flames, police said.
A fire service spokesman said: "On arrival crews reported that the aircraft was 100% alight."
Essex Police said the plane was an eight-seater, but there were only two people on board.
A police spokesperson said: "We now believe there to have been two people on board the light aircraft which crashed in the field off Gravel Lane in Chigwell. Sadly they both died."
The plane took off from nearby Stapleford Airfield, the aircraft's owners said.
Ray Gibbs, who was at Woolston Manor Golf and Country Club, said: "We were playing golf and heard a loud bang and the ground rumbled a bit, but we couldn't see any smoke, so we're not sure how far away it was."
Road closures were affecting Gravel Lane, Abridge Road, Miller's Lane, Lambourne Road and Pudding Lane.
Police said officers were working with the Air Accident Investigation Branch.
