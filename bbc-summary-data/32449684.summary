"You've been so loyal all along," Diesel told the assembled cinema owners. "You helped us create history here."
Furious 7 was temporarily halted following the death of star Paul Walker in a car crash two years ago.
Released this month, it is currently the seventh highest-grossing film ever.
The film, starring Diesel, Walker, Jason Statham and Michelle Rodriguez, has made $1.15 billion (Â£759 million) at the worldwide box office.
It took a record-breaking $143 million on its opening weekend in the US and became the fastest film to take more than $1 billion (Â£669.5 million) worldwide.
Walker was midway through shooting the movie when he died in November 2013, at the age of 40.
Special effects technicians and stunt doubles enabled the completion of the project, which has been called  "a cathartic experience for fans of Walker".
"The last time I was on this stage I was with my brother Pablo," said an emotional Vin Diesel at CinemaCon on Thursday, referring to his friend Walker by his nickname.
Reports suggest that Kurt Russell will also return to the latest film - with rumours it will be shot predominantly in New York.
"We're going to make the best movie you've ever seen," said Diesel. "Furious 8 will be yours to share with the world on April 14, 2017."
