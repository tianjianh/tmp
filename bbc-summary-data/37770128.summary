Northern Irishman Frampton, 29, beat Santa Cruz in a thrilling bout in July to become the first Irish fighter to win world titles at two weights.
Frampton believes his second bout with the Mexican will be "one of the biggest fights in world boxing".
"Our first fight in July was a war," said the defending champion.
"I believe that January 28th will be exactly the same."
Frampton, who has won all 23 of his professional bouts, said he is thrilled about the prospect of the the Las Vegas contest which will take place at the MGM Grand Garden Arena.
"It's a dream come true for me to be headlining in Las Vegas, where some of the biggest fights of all time have taken place.
"I've learnt a lot from our first fight. Leo is a warrior but I'm going to win even more convincingly the second time around."
Frampton, who had previously held the IBF and WBA super-bantamweights titles, moved up a weight to take on the unbeaten three-weight world champion in New York.
One judge saw the contest as a draw but the other two had Frampton as a clear victor.
Frampton first became a world champion in September 2014 when beat Spain's Kiko Martinez on a points decision in their IBF super bantamweight clash.
