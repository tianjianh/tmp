[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Police said the blaze spread from a plastic garden shed to a house in Limefield Crescent, Bathgate, at about 23:15 on Friday.
Two men, aged 32 and 29, and a 37-year-old woman, managed to get out of the house and call the emergency services.
Police are treating the incident as wilful fire-raising.
Det Con Craig O'Mara, from Livingston CID, said: "Thankfully none of the people in the house were injured but the fire has caused significant damage to the house as well as the shed in the garden.
"At this stage the motive has still to be established.
"Limefield Crescent is a residential area and although at this time of night there may not have been people out in the street, it is quite possible people in the houses around the area may have seen something out of the ordinary, someone they didn't recognise hanging about or indeed who started the fire."
