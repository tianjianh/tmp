Emergency services were called out at about 19:00 on Wednesday to Purveshaugh Farm near Earlston.
No people or livestock were harmed but the barn suffered "substantial damage" including the collapse of its roof.
Police want to hear from anyone who saw any activity near the barn around the time of the incident.
Insp Alistair Hutchens said: "This has been a substantial fire in an area that contains livestock and is well used by agricultural workers.
"We believe the fire to be suspicious and are asking for the public's help in tracing those responsible.
"I would ask that anyone who was in the area at the time and saw anything suspicious to please get in touch as soon as possible."
