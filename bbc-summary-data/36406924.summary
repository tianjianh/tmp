County Championship: Gareth Batty takes 7-32 as wickets tumble at Taunton

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Surrey captain Gareth Batty took 7-32 before Somerset responded strongly as 18 wickets fell on day two of their Division One fixture at Taunton.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The visitors added 28 to their overnight total as they were bowled out for 264 in their first innings.
Somerset got to 46-0 in reply before veteran spinner Batty ripped through their batting order as the hosts collapsed to 102 all out.
However, Jack Leach (3-37) helped reduce Surrey to 94-6 at the close.
Having decided against enforcing the follow-on, Surrey crumbled to 51-6 before Zafar Ansari (26 not out) guided them through to a lead of 256 runs at the close.
Marcus Trescothick and Tom Abell gave Somerset a solid foundation to their first innings, but the home side's batting line-up fell apart once the pair had departed in successive overs.
Batty, ably supported by pace bowler Stuart Meaker (3-39), took all 10 wickets between them for just 56 runs.
But slow-left-armer Leach, who took 4-34 in Surrey's first innings, kept Somerset in with a chance of forcing a victory with three more wickets when Surrey batted for a second time.
