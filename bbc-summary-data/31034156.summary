Consent guidance in rape cases goes beyond 'no means no'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Police and prosecutors are to be given fresh guidance on consent in rape cases.

The advice will go beyond the idea of "no means no" to indentify when possible victims may have been unable to give consent.
The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) said this will include situations where someone is drunk or has taken drugs.
New guidance will also assess if "a suspect held a position of power over the potential victim."
This aspect of the new guidance will take in account whether someone who claims to have been raped knew any potential suspects "as a teacher, an employer, a doctor or a fellow gang member".

There'll also be clearer advice on complainants with mental health problems, learning difficulties and those who were asleep or unconscious at the time of the alleged attack.
New guidance also covers domestic violence situations and those where "the complainant may be financially or otherwise dependent on their alleged rapist".
The toolkit also advises officers and lawyers to ask how the suspect knew that the complainant had consented "with full capacity and freedom to do so".
Alison Saunders, the Director of Public Prosecutions, said: "For too long society has blamed rape victims for confusing the issue of consent - by drinking or dressing provocatively for example - but it is not they who are confused, it is society itself and we must challenge that.
"Consent to sexual activity is not a grey area - in law it is clearly defined and must be given fully and freely.
"It is not a crime to drink, but it is a crime for a rapist to target someone who is no longer capable of consenting to sex though drink.
The current legal definition of rape is:
The definition of consent and the law surrounding consent:
This means a key point for the jury was whether the victim had capacity to make a choice - and whether the accused reasonably believed he or she had consented.
Mrs Saunders added: "We want police and prosecutors to make sure they ask in every case where consent is the issue - how did the suspect know the complainant was saying yes and doing so freely and knowingly?"
Metropolitan Police Assistant Commissioner Martin Hewitt said: "As report after report has shown, there is still far too much variation in the way that forces move a complaint of rape through the system.
"Reporting of sexual offences is up 22% in the latest statistics because of increased confidence in our service and recording but we have further to go."
