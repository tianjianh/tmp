Dagenham manager John Still told BBC Radio London: "The boys have competed, as they have done, against a side that's going for the play-offs.
"At the end of the day it's always about the same things. It's about the two boxes; we should have been 1-0 up at half-time.
"Our confidence isn't high but we've competed brilliantly."
