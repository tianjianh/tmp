Squirrel cheats death by jumping into car engine

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A squirrel cheated death by jumping into a car engine just before it was about to get run over.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Mark Leyshon, 28, feared he had killed the squirrel when driving his son to see Father Christmas in Llanberris, Gwynedd, but later found it wedged between his car's grill and radiator.
The squirrel was freed six hours later at a local garage.
"It was quite an incredible rescue," said Mr Leyshon.
"I swerved to avoid it and I felt a bang so I assumed I'd hit it. But it must have jumped at the last second."
Mr Leyshon said the squirrel "bolted and climbed a tree" as soon as it was free, adding: "It didn't appear to be injured at all so it was a good result all around."
