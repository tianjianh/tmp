[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Kevin O'Donnell, 24, produced the items from inside his body in Dundee's police headquarters after being arrested on another matter.
Dundee Sheriff Court was told he planned to smuggle heroin and anti-anxiety drug alprazolam into prison to pay off a relative's drug debt.
O'Donnell admitted being concerned in the supply of the drugs on 16 February.
Depute fiscal Vicki Bell told the court: "The heroin amounted to 28.5g with a value of Â£13,000 in prison.
"The value of that alprazolam was Â£2,025 in prison.
"There was also a mobile telephone found wrapped in cling film that he said he intended to take to prison with him."
Solicitor advocate Jim Laverty, defending, said: "A family member had fallen foul of drug dealers and he agreed to do this to clear that debt.
"He himself has dabbled in alcohol and diazepam during his early adolescence and his 20s but certainly my experience of him is that he is not someone who has a drug addiction difficulty."
Sheriff Alastair Carmichael said: "These are two serious offences, particularly when the intended market was people inside our prisons."
