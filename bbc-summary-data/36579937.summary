[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 28-year-old central defender, who has signed a three-year deal, has left Bournemouth for a reported Â£3m fee.
Elphick captained the Cherries to promotion from the Championship in 2015, having also led them up from League One two years earlier.
He made just 14 appearances during Bournemouth's first season in the top flight because of an ankle injury.
He cut short his honeymoon to report to the Midlands, undergo a medical and complete his transfer negotiations.
Di Matteo is looking to Elphick to help lead Villa back to the Premier League at the first attempt following their drop to the Championship.
The former Brighton apprentice has so far spent all of his career on the south coast.
He made his debut for the Seagulls in 2005, scoring nine goals in 182 appearances before joining the Cherries in 2012, since when he has scored a further six times in 145 appearances.
