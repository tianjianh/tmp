[SN]TITLE[SN]
Bristol City 1-0 Rotherham United

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Milan Djuric's second-half header saw Bristol City beat relegation rivals Rotherham to end the longest winless run in the Championship.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
City had not won for nine games, having lost eight of those matches.
But they ended their poor run of form, and eased the pressure on boss Lee Johnson, as Djuric headed in after Jamie Paterson's shot was parried by Millers keeper Richard O'Donnell.
The win means City remain three points clear of third-from-bottom Blackburn.
Rotherham, who are rooted at the bottom of the table with just 16 points from 30 games, were left to rue missed chances in a first half they largely dominated.
After Tammy Abraham fired wide for City from 12 yards early on, Danny Ward went close at the other end with an attempt that flashed wide and defender Mark Little almost turned Anthony Forde's cross into his own net.
O'Donnell then prevented an Abraham header from going in before Robins boss Johnson made three second-half changes, including the withdrawal of the on-loan Chelsea striker, which led to boos and chants against the manager from the home crowd.
But Johnson's changes made the difference as Paterson's attempt, turned away by O'Donnell, set up fellow substitute Djuric to claim his first goal for City since joining from Italian side Cesena in January.
Bristol City boss Lee Johnson: "I know it was a controversial decision (to make the changes) but I believe we needed that spark and they gave us that spark.
"It's nothing against the players I took off. I was putting on a goalscorer, it's not like I was putting on a centre-half.
"You make the decisions, sometimes they are right, sometimes they are wrong. Luckily they were right on this occasion.
"Now we are on a good run, with a draw and a win and we have to maintain that."
Rotherham manager Paul Warne: "I don't think there was anything between the two sides, we set up 4-1-4-1 initially and I thought we contained them quite well.
"As a group I thought my lads performed to their limits. I don't know how much more I can ask of them physically.
"It was a tight game. People will think it's the same old story but I don't think we deserved to lose. I think a point would have been a fair result."
