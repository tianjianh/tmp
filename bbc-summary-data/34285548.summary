She is now settled in Cardiff with her baby son Nabil, although her husband is still a refugee in Jordan.
Her story starts in 2011 with bombing in her home city of Daraa, when the couple fled.
Asmaa spent three years as a refugee, but under pressure to return to Syria, she took a journey via Turkey, Italy and France before arriving in Kent as a stowaway in the back of a lorry.
She said she looked to the UK as a place where she could be safe with her baby.
