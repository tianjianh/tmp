Belleek crash: John Fahy not guilty of toddler's death

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man has been found not guilty of causing the death of a toddler in a car crash in County Fermanagh.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
John Fahy, 25, of Groagagh, Grange in County Sligo, was acquitted of two charges of causing death and grievous bodily injury by careless driving.
Nineteen-month-old Ryan Cox died in the crash on Boa Island Road near Belleek in January 2013.
The jury reached a unanimous verdict at Dungannon Crown Court in acquitting the architecture student of the charges.
Ryan's parents cried as the verdict was delivered on Wednesday.
Mr Fahy had been in his final year at Ulster University at the time of the crash, and he now hopes to return to complete his studies.
Both Mr Fahy and Ryan's mother, Katriona Cox, were also badly injured in the crash.
During the trial, prosecutors argued that "either through inexperience or over steering", Mr Fahy had lost control of his car.
Mr Fahy told the court he remembered as he drove around the bend before the crash, he noticed a car "apparently in my lane and I remember flashing my lights".
After Wednesday's verdict, neither Ryan's parents nor Mr Fahy wanted to comment on the case.
