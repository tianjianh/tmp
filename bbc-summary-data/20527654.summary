[SN]TITLE[SN]
South West Water customers to get £50 yearly discount

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Customers of South West Water (SWW) are to be given a yearly £50 discount from April, the company says.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
SWW said the discount would automatically appear in people's bills every April until at least 2020.
The government-funded discount is to cover the extra cost of cleaning up South West England's bathing waters.
Bills for SWW customers - in Devon and Cornwall, plus parts of Dorset and Somerset - are about £150 higher than the national average, at about £540.
Last March, MPs agreed to legislation meaning a £400m government subsidy for SWW.
Since privatisation in 1989, SWW bills have risen steadily to help pay for Operation Clean Sweep - a £2bn investment programme to improve beach water quality and revamp the region's sewage system.
