Miriam Gonzalez Durantez: Don't call me Mrs Clegg

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Miriam Gonzalez Durantez, whose husband is former Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg, has complained after being invited to an International Women's Day event in her married name.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Posting a picture of a letter addressed to "Mrs Clegg" on Instagram, she noted the "irony" of the situation.
The event, on 8 March, is designed to "celebrate women's success", she added.
Ms Gonzalez Durantez is a lawyer specialising in international and EU trade law.
She wrote: "The irony of being invited to speak at an International Women's Day event to celebrate women's success, addressed to me as 'Mrs Clegg'."
Ms Gonzalez Durantez set up the Inspiring Women group, which recruits women with successful careers to visit and speak to girls at state schools in England.
This is not the first time she has criticised the way she is perceived or described.
Last year she told Marie Claire magazine: "I find people say of me 'She wears the trousers' and as you can see, it is true, I have very nice trousers.
"Or if my husband and I share the school run, it's me who has forced him, dragged him away from his work.
"But when people, or in my case the media, are using that label on you, they are not saying you are strong, they are saying you should get back in your box. You should make the dinner and have his slippers ready with a gin and tonic."
