It followed reports in October 2014 that the 17-year-old was attacked in Gabalfa.
A BBC Crimewatch reconstruction followed as part of the inquiry, with scores of calls from the public in response to an appeal.
But South Wales Police said no further action will be taken.
Det Insp Lloyd Williams said: "As a result of our inquiries, our investigation has concluded and no further police action will be taken."
