The figures for the first three months of 2015 show BBC Radio Cymru recorded a rise of 20,000 in its weekly audience to a total of 126,000.
It is a year since the station's major schedule changes. In the second half of 2014, Radio Cymru's weekly audience had fallen to its lowest on record.
BBC Radio Wales lost 1,000 listeners compared to the previous three months.
It recorded a weekly audience of 426,000 listeners.
A spokesman for BBC Wales called the figures "encouraging" for Radio Cymru.
"These figures are consistent and we'll be looking at the detail carefully to strengthen our stations further," he added.
In the commercial sector, some of the country's most popular stations saw their weekly audiences increase.
Juice FM, which broadcasts in north east Wales and Liverpool, gained 23,000 weekly listeners to reach an average of 257,000 a week.
But others saw their audiences fall, including Heart South Wales which lost 50,000 listeners during the first three months of the year, averaging a weekly audience of 447,000.
There was also a fall of 22,000 for Capital South Wales every week, with 186,000 listeners tuning in.
Swansea Sound lost 5,000 listeners to an average of 64,000 people a week.
