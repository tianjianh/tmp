[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Forest face Ipswich Town on Sunday and must match or better Blackburn Rovers' result away against Brentford to be certain of staying in the Championship.
Forest's longest-serving player Cohen, 30, told BBC Radio Nottingham his deal "will all be sorted next week".
"I am just concentrating on winning on Sunday - that's what matters."
"I have always wanted to stay no matter where we are. Hopefully that will be in the Championship."
Forest are only above Blackburn Rovers by one goal.
Blackburn will survive if they better Forest's result. If they match Forest's result, Rovers must effect a two-goal swing on Forest to finish above them, as Forest's goal difference is better by one and they have also scored nine more goals. Blackburn will go down if both clubs draw.
But if Forest beat Ipswich then they could also finish above Birmingham City - if the Blues fail to win their final match of the season at Bristol City.
Meanwhile, Switzerland international midfielder Pajtim Kasami has left the club, reports BBC Radio Nottingham.
The 24-year-old's loan deal from Greek side Olympiacos was not due to expire until the end of the season.
Kasami made 27 appearances this term, but has not played under new manager Mark Warburton.
