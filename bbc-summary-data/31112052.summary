A convicted rapist who carried out a failed sex attack on a teenager in East Dunbartonshire has been given a lifelong restriction order.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Keith Pollock, 50, admitted assaulting the 16-year-old girl, with intent to rape, in Milton of Campsie in the early hours of 26 January last year.
He ran off after her screams alerted a passing driver. She later identified him through his "deep voice".
As part of the order, Pollock will serve a minimum of two years in jail.
Following his conviction, it emerged that Pollock was jailed for seven years in 1991 in Australia for rape.
Pollock was deported from Australia after being freed from that sentence and was latterly living with his partner and young child in Milton of Campsie.
The High Court in Glasgow heard that the girl had left her boyfriend's house in the early hours and decided to walk home.
She later spotted a hooded man near her before he ran up behind her.
The teenager called her boyfriend and told him she believed she was being followed.
Prosecutor Ian Wallace told the court: "Her boyfriend heard nothing for a few seconds and then he heard his girlfriend screaming. At that point the phone cut out."
Mr Wallace said Pollock grabbed the girl, put his hand over her mouth and tried to drag her backwards.
He then repeatedly punched his victim on the face before attempting to push her over a wall into a park.
The advocate depute told how the victim "screamed throughout the attack" and believed she was going to be raped.
Pollock slapped the girl in a bid to silence her - but a delivery driver heard her crying for help.
The man confronted Pollock who threatened him before running off.
The court heard that on 1 March 2014, the victim took part in a voice identification parade.
She had recalled her attacker having "a really deep voice" - which lead to her picking out Pollock.
His DNA was also found on the girl's top, leading to his arrest.
