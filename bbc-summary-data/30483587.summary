Swansea cannot only rely on Wilfried Bony for goals - Williams

Swansea City cannot rely on Wilfried Bony alone for goals, says captain Ashley Williams.

Ivorian striker Bony, 26, has scored eight of the Swans' last 13 goals in the Premier League.
And with Swansea winning only one of their last five league games, Williams, 30, has urged his side to ease the scoring burden on Bony.
"We need to chip in with more goals as a team. We need to find goals from other places on the pitch," he said.
Swansea could be without Bony for a lengthy period when he joins the Ivory Coast squad for the African Cup of Nations.
With the Elephants expected to convene early in January and with the final taking place on 8 February, the Swans might be shorn of their top-scorer for a month.
Bony scored Swansea's only goal in Sunday's 2-1 defeat by Tottenham, a match Swans manager Garry Monk felt they could have won had they been more clinical.
It was their second loss in succession following their 3-1 reverse at West Ham, and Williams says Swansea must improve in front of goal to turn their fortunes around.

"We need to take our chances, we all know that," said Williams.
"We get a lot of chances in most games, especially at home. You've got to take them.
"This is the Premier League. The amount of chances we get, you can't keep missing and expect to win games."
Swansea are ninth in the table and travel to relegation-threatened Hull on Saturday.
But Williams warns his side could come unstuck against the Tigers if they continue wasting goal-scoring opportunities.
"It's pretty simple really. We need to convert chances. We have to take them," he added.
"When I say we need to take chances, as a team we need to share the goals out a lot better.
"It hurts. We have to pick ourselves back up and go to Hull, which is always a difficult place."
