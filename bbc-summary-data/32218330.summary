Dan Stevens restored the 72ft (22m) boat at his Plymouth boatyard after he spotted it languishing on the Mediterranean island.
The revamped vessel, used by Virgin boss Sir Richard Branson to set his 1986 Atlantic crossing record, carries an asking price of £725,000.
Mr Stevens said his main concern was finding a "good home".
"I have done my bit and saved it," he said, adding he would make only a "small amount of money" from the sale.
Sir Richard,  who revisited the restored boat in 2013, tweeted: "My old record-breaking boat, Virgin Atlantic Challenger II is up for sale. Fancy an adventure?"
In a statement on his website, he said: "I love Challenger II not only because it is a beautiful boat, but as it gave us a platform to challenge ourselves, push boundaries and embrace the spirit of adventure.
"I hope whoever buys it is keen for more explorations on the high seas."
Challenger II was sold in the late 1980s, reportedly to a sultan and later to an English owner, and spent about seven years moored in Majorca until Mr Stevens bought her.
Mr Stevens said he had spent about £400,000 restoring the boat after buying it for a "couple of hundred thousand pounds".
He said: "I have put a lot of blood and sweat into doing the refit.
"But it is now time for me to move it on.
"It is not about the money, it's about finding someone who is sensitive about the boat.
"I would like to see it remain in the UK."
