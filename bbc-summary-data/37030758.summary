Catalina Usme's 90th-minute strike gave Colombia their first ever Olympic point and held the favourites to a 2-2 draw.
Australia's emphatic 6-1 win over Zimbabwe in Group F ensured their quarter-final place.
Home nation Brazil finished as group leaders after a 0-0 draw against South Africa in Group E.
Brazil pushed for victory in front of a sell-out crowd but a fine save by South Africa's Roxanne Barker denied Brazil a late strike.
The United States, who won gold at London 2012, went behind early in the game when Usme capitalised on goalkeeper Hope Solo's slip.
However captain Carli Lloyd set up Crystal Dunn for the equaliser before Mallory Pugh scored a low strike in the second half, which was cancelled out by Usme's second in extra time.
A double from Michelle Hayman ensured Australia moved into the next round, although Zimbabwe had some cause for team celebrations when Emmaculate Msipa scored a consolation strike.
World champions Germany moved into the quarter-finals despite Melissa Tancredi scoring a double to give Canada a 2-1 victory.
France celebrated their second-place finish in Group G with a 3-0 victory over New Zealand, with Louisa Cadamuro backing up her earlier goal with another in the 92nd minute.
China and Sweden took the remaining quarter-final spots, with a 0-0 draw enough to see both sides through.
