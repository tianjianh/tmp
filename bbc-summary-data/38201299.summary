Real Madrid captain Sergio Ramos has warned his team-mates not to get carried away despite the club's healthy lead at the top of La Liga.

The defender scored in stoppage-time to snatch a 1-1 draw at Barcelona on Saturday to ensure the leaders stayed six points clear of their rivals.
Real have not won the league title since 2012 under Jose Mourinho.
"It's better to have it in our own hands than depend on others," said Spain international Ramos, 30.
"We mustn't get carried away because there's still a long way to go in La Liga."
Real have one more La Liga game at home to Deportivo La Coruna on 10 December before the European champions fly to Japan to compete at the 2016 Fifa Club World Cup.
Barca finished one point ahead of Real to win the Spanish top-flight title last season.
Saturday's result at the Nou Camp could be critical should the title race come down to head-to-head records.
Real and Barcelona are scheduled to meet next in La Liga at the Bernabeu on 23 April 2017.
Ramos, a World Cup winner in 2010, added: "The points difference is reward for the hard work we've been doing since the start of the season.
"The hard work has reaped rewards and it's better to get one point than nothing at all.
"We have to keep picking up points and maintaining the gap from Barcelona."
