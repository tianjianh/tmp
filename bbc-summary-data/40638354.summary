Jacqui Beale, 48, from Derbyshire, suffered broken ribs and a punctured lung, and was left needing stitches to her face when she was attacked while walking her dog.
She and another victim, from West Yorkshire, are taking legal action.
The National Farmers' Union (NFU) said walkers "must be most aware of the issues" in the countryside.
Ms Beale said she thought she was going to die when she was attacked by eight cows in May.
The dog groomer, from Wirksworth, added: "I was bashed about by about eight cows. I remember being tossed from one to another and thinking I wasn't going to survive.
"All I could hear was snorting and breathing, it was terrifying."
Ms Beale, whose dog was on a lead at the time of the attack in May, managed to get herself to safety and now wants to warn others.

Grandfather-of-five Mike Pace, from Huddersfield, was trampled while walking along a public footpath with his wife Gill on holiday in Abersoch in Gwynedd, Wales, in August.
The 55-year-old said: "This black bullock that had been staring looking menacing charged me and threw me up in the air and then the other cattle just started trampling me.
"While on the floor I had a conversation with myself thinking I was going to die. I told myself I'd had a good life."
Mrs Pace escaped unharmed, but her husband spent more than a month in hospital and still needs crutches to walk.
Sally Gray, a personal injury specialist at Slater and Gordon, is representing a number of people who have been injured by cattle.
"When it comes to public liability and the risk owed to the public, farmers have been advised not to put calves and their mothers in fields that are open to the public together," she added.
A spokesperson for the NFU said: "The countryside is a working environment where animals graze so it's important that people are mindful of this.
"Spring and summer are when we love to enjoy the countryside, so it is this time of year when walkers must be most aware of the issues."
