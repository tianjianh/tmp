National Records of Scotland (NRS) figures show that Jack and Emily were the top names for the last eight and two years respectively.
Leo, Brodie, Harrison, Georgie and Rosie all climbed 2015's list.
Leo climbed 11 places in the boys' list to 13th, Brodie moved up 12 to 31st, and Harrison was up 13 to 35th. Among girls, Georgia climbed 12 places to 27th, and Rosie was up 15 to 35th.
The births of 25,970 boys and 24,490 girls were registered in the period covered by the figures.
This year, the number of unique names chosen by parents were "well above" the levels of 10, 20 or 40 years ago, according to NRS.
1,977 boys and 2,714 girls were given first forenames that were unique this year.
Jack was the top boys' first forename in 15 council areas, Oliver was top in six areas, James was top in four, and Finlay and Noah were each top in two areas.
Emily was the most popular girls' first forename in nine council areas, Sophie was top in seven and Isla was top in five. Amelia was top in four areas, and Ava, Lily and Olivia were each top in two areas.
Several other names were top (or joint top) in one council area, including Muhammad which was  the most popular boys' name in Glasgow - for a third year.
The annual list of baby names reveals that John has slipped further down the top 100. It was consistently the second most popular name throughout the 1970s, but in 2015 it ranked 59th.
In numbers, here is its fall from popularity.
However, while it has faded away as a first name, in 2015 it was the second most popular middle name with 1,204 mentions.
