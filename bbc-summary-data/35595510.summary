The Argentina international was out of contract in the summer and had been linked with Chelsea and Inter Milan.
But the 30-year-old has instead joined the Beijing-based side, who are owned by billionaire Wang Wenxue.
The league's transfer window shuts on 26 February and over £200m has been spent on signings so far.
Jiangsu Suning paid £63.4m for Brazilian midfielders Alex Teixeira and Ramires, while Jackson Martinez has made a £31m move to Guangzhou Evergrande from Atletico Madrid.
"His arrival will make the team's attack more incisive, we look forward to him showing off his brave spirit," the club said of Levezzi, who joined PSG from Napoli in 2012 for £23m.
Lavezzi joins ex-Arsenal striker Gervinho and Cameroon captain Stephane Mbia at Hebei China Fortune.
The CSL season starts on 4 March.
Each team can have a total of five foreign players on their books, which must include one from the Asian Football Confederation, and each club is only allowed to field a maximum of four overseas players at any one time.
