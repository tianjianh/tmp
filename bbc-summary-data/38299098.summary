Swansea City boss Bob Bradley says he has had "consistent" talks with the club's owners about how to improve his squad in the January transfer window.

The Swans have struggled this term but lifted themselves off the bottom of the Premier League with a 3-0 win against Sunderland on Saturday.
Bradley's side face West Brom and Middlesbrough in their next two games.
"We still feel we can use it [January] to improve our squad and discussions need to continue," Bradley said.
"The discussions have been consistent.
"As a manager in a period where the team is really trying to fight back from a difficult start, the best thing that can happen is to see important players step onto the field and play well and that sets the one for everyone else."
After being appointed as replacement for former manager Francesco Guidolin, Bradley has not played the same starting XI in any of his eight games in charge and is still not sure of his best line-up.
"I think we've made good progress. Good performances from good players is what allows you to start to settle into your best team, assuming you can avoid injuries and suspensions," he told BBC Radio Wales Sport.
"Certainly we feel strongly that we want to try and build on the work from Saturday and will it be the exact same team? I'm not sure but I think you'll still see a pretty good carryover from the game against Sunderland."
Despite taking just eight points from a possible 24 during his time in charge, Bradley believes his side is showing signs of improvement.
"We showed signs of good football in the previous seven games [before the win against Sunderland] but not always in a consistent enough manner," he added.
"Confidence is still important and with results, we're trying to see if we can build up that confidence."
