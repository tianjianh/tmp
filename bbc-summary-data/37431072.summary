A Tommaso Allan penalty was followed by centre Tommaso Benvenuti going under the posts, fly-half Allan converting.
Rynard Landman struck back for the Dragons and Angus O'Brien added a penalty, but the Welsh side lost their try-scorer at the break.
Filo Paulo and Marco Fuser crossed for the Italians after the break.
The hosts thwarted centre Adam Warren's early break, then went ahead as Allan kicked the game's opening points.
Having been hammered 64-10 at Ospreys in the previous round, Treviso were determined to make amends in front of their own fans.
Benvenuti's try underlined that intent and although South African lock Landman gave the visitors hope and O'Brien brought them within two points at the break, the Dragons were unable to trouble Treviso's tryline again.
Former Cardiff Blues lock Paulo crossed at a corner flag, Allan converting before exchanging penalties with O'Brien.
The Dragons' hopes of a late comeback ended with a 79th-minute touchdown for Paulo's second-row partner Fuser, again converted by Allan.
Dragons boss Kingsley Jones told BBC Wales: "Fair play to Treviso. They didn't do too much flash. They played very smartly, played in the right areas.
"But ultimately it came down really to us failing to kick accurately.
"We forced things in the end. We were really trying to get back, trying to get the bonus point and credit to the players for that effort.
"But we were a little bit na√Øve because we allowed another try really, for Treviso."
