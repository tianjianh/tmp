The police chief in charge of counter-terrorism in the East Midlands says some people who travelled to join so-called Islamic State have returned.

Peter Goodman, deputy chief constable for the East Midlands, said his team had identified a number of people from the region who had been radicalised.
He said communities and families must help in challenging "warped and dangerous" internet messages.
Mr Goodman said that the threat being posed "kept him awake at night".
He said his main concern was people's "rationale" for going to IS-controlled areas.
"The real concern is that they will be radicalised, desensitised, exposed to real atrocities that will change their outlook on life and may affect their behaviour back here in the UK," he said.
"It absolutely keeps me awake at night; we're talking about predominantly young people with not a great deal of life experience who are receiving a very corrupt narrative."
Prevent, a government counter-terrorism strategy, is one method employed by East Midlands officers to engage with young people.
The scheme has been controversial and has been criticised for possibly stigmatising Muslims.
However, PC Rizwaan Chothia, who runs Prevent courses in the region, said it was about trying to intervene at an early stage.
He said: "There is a misconception that exists out there that the Prevent agenda is about spying on the Muslim community.
"As a Muslim police officer, a practising Muslim, I would be mortified if that was the case... It's about trying to safeguard individuals."
People known to have travelled from the East Midlands to IS-controlled areas include Kabir Ahmed, from Derby, who died last November.
Ahmed was named as being among the suicide bombers who killed a senior Iraqi police official in Baghdad.
Friends of Ahmed in Derby said he was "easily led" and may have been "brainwashed" into joining militants.
A family member said his world view became "much narrower" later in life and at some point was taken in by "extremist ideology".
