The discovery in Tainan city has brought rescue efforts to an end, mayor William Lai announced.
The death toll from the 6.4-magnitude earthquake now stands at 116.
Mr Lai identified the last missing person to be pulled out from the apartment building's rubble as Hsieh Chen-yu.
He was part of the building's management committee and "might have wanted to wait until everyone else had left", Lai said, according to the Central News Agency.
On Friday, the president and president-elect attended a memorial service held by relatives of the dead and missing.
All but two of the people killed had been inside the 17-storey building, which completely collapsed.
Lin Ming-hui, the developer of the Weiguan Jinlong (Golden Dragon) complex, and two architects have been detained on suspicion of negligence, amid accusations that the building was poorly constructed.
