[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Two teenagers have appeared in court accused of animal cruelty after breaking into a cat sanctuary.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A 15-year-old boy, who cannot be named, pleaded not guilty to burglary at the Ty Nant Cat Sanctuary in Cymmer, Neath Port Talbot, on 30 July.
He also denied two counts of destroying a cat and will stand trial on 13 December.
Frank Lewis, 18, of Croeserw, did not enter a plea during the brief hearing at Swansea Crown Court.
He is expected to enter his plea at his next court appearance on 22 September.
Meanwhile, about 20 people demonstrated outside and shouted at the pair as they left the court building.
A GoFundMe page set up to raise funds for the sanctuary has collected almost Â£20,000.
