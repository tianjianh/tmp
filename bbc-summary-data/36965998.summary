Wales assistant manager Osian Roberts says he expects Chris Coleman to be in charge for the opening World Cup qualifier against Moldova on 5 September.

The Football Association of Wales (FAW) rejected an approach by Hull City to speak to 46-year-old Coleman.
Coleman guided Wales to the semi-finals of Euro 2016 a month after signing a new two-year contract with the FAW.
"We're fully focused on Moldova," Roberts told BBC Radio Wales Sport.
"We've started our preparation and planning for the Moldova game and that will continue over the next three or four weeks."
The former Fulham manager is one of the candidates the Premier League new boys have targeted to replace Steve Bruce.
Bruce resigned in July after a breakdown in his relationship with Hull vice-chairman Ehab Allam.
Coleman, who succeeded the late Gary Speed as Wales manager in January 2012, has already said the 2018 World Cup campaign will be his last in charge of Wales.
"The plan is to try and get the team to Russia and as he's already stated, after that he will look at his options," Roberts added.
"If that goes to plan in two years' time he'll be looking at club involvement, whether that will be here in the UK or abroad."
Roberts is not surprised Coleman has been targeted by Hull following Wales' success at Euro 2016, their first appearance in a major tournament in 58 years.
"There's always going to be speculation any time a major job becomes vacant," Roberts said.
"It's going to be quite natural in the next few weeks and months that the speculation will exist
"That's due to the great work Chris has achieved with the national team."
