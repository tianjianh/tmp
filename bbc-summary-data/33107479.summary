Moirai Capital Investment Ltd's proposal will see all the elements of the £120m project built around the existing Oasis leisure centre.
The new complex will cover more than 30 acres and also includes a skate park, hotel, restaurants and cafes.
Morai revised its original proposal following a public consultation.
Last year, Swindon Borough Council extended the planning application deadline for the development after the firm failed to meet the original deadline.
A condition of the lease was that the firm refurbished the Oasis. The work to the 37-year-old site was delayed but has now been completed at a cost of £2m.
Morai's Martin Barber said consideration had been given to the "best possible layout for the project" as well as traffic management and its potential environmental impact.
"We are confident that the submission we have made takes account of all these and other factors," he added.
Swindon Borough Council's Garry Perkins said: "I am satisfied that now Moirai have put together a proposal that matches the council's ambitions for the North Star site.
"I look forward to hearing more as they get closer to turning these plans into a reality and gain commitments from prospective operators."
Morai said if planning permission is granted the development could open in late 2017.
Forward Swindon has also completed a feasibility study for a bridge linking the North Star site with Swindon railway station.
The company, which is responsible for delivering economic growth in the town, anticipates that many visitors to the new facility will arrive by train and is seeking funding for the structure.
