[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Ireland's London 2012 gold medallist Katie Taylor is in negotiations to turn professional.

Five-time world champion Taylor, 30, is considering an offer from promoter Eddie Hearn's Matchroom Boxing outfit.
The Bray woman has been linked with a move to the professional ranks since missing out on a medal at the Rio Olympic Games in August.
Taylor lost narrowly to Finland's Mira Potkonen at the quarter-final stage of the women's lightweight competition.
The Irishwoman's domination of the 60kg division was initially dented in April when she suffered a unanimous points defeat by Azerbaijan's Yana Alekseevna at the Olympic qualifying tournament in Turkey.
She was subsequently beaten in the world championship lightweight semi-finals in May, having to settle for bronze after losing on a split decision to France's Estelle Mossely in Kazakhstan.
Taylor has fought as an amateur since her first officially sanctioned fight aged 15 in 2003.
She had been training with the Ireland squad since Rio but is now expected to make a decision about her future soon, with the Ireland squad for the forthcoming European Championships in Bulgaria due to be named by the end of this week.
