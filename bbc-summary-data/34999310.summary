The Carterhaugh Ba' Game is thought to have been an early forerunner of the modern game of rugby.
One account of the match, which was held on 4 December 1815, suggests the ball was picked up and slung between team mates.
It came eight years before the game of rugby purportedly originated at Rugby School.
The original game was played on part of the Bowhill Estate called the Carterhaugh peninsular - between the Ettrick and Yarrow Waters, near Selkirk.
Around 1,000 men are estimated to have taken part while another 2,000 spectators cheered on the teams from Selkirk and Yarrow.
Organised by Sir Walter Scott, James Hogg and the fourth Duke of Buccleuch, the game was accompanied by pipes, banners and wild celebrations.
The game was re-created as part of a day-long celebration event on Friday, which included a traditional hand ba' game played by local enthusiasts.
The re-enactment was officially started by the current Duke of Buccleuch, who threw a ball in the air.
In a narrated interpretation of the original game, it featured a local re-enactment group, drummers, flagbearers, halberdiers, musketeers and jesters.
The event was organised by The Bill McLaren Foundation and Bowhill House - the Selkirk home of the Duke of Buccleuch.
