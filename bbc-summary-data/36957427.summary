Connor McAliskey insists Tyrone players "have the freedom to express ourselves" despite all the talk of regimented systems in modern day gaelic football.

Claims that 'the system' is now king have gained currently since Jim McGuinness led Donegal to the 2012 All-Ireland title.
However, forward McAliskey says Mickey Harte encourages his Tyrone players to use their own initiative.
"You have the freedom to emphasise your playing ability," insists McAliskey.
Clonoe forward McAliskey accepts that the Red Hands, under the tutelage of Harte, have worked hard to develop their counter-attacking style of play over the past 18 months.
"Everybody (in the panel) knows it inside out and what we are meant to do," McAliskey told BBC Sport Northern Ireland's Mark Sidebottom.
"People talk about that counter-attacking set-up but we're given freedom to go (and make our own decisions) when we do turn the ball over.
"There is no (rigid) set-up of how we are supposed to counter-attack. We just go and express ourselves.
"When you have the fitness to go and attack in numbers, and you have three or four doing that, that gives you the freedom to express your own playing ability. It's not a set system."
Manager Harte also rejects assertions that the rise of tactical plans and systems inevitably means that individual talent and initiative is being curbed.
"Every game takes on a script of its own," says the Tyrone boss.
"While people might get hung up a little bit and think everything is about systems and plans, there is still a lot of initiative required from good players to win games.
"I think we have plenty of players with initiative and the capacity to adapt and adjust.
"There's a basic script that you want to try and adhere to but you have to let people cut loose as well and do they do well which is becoming very creative players."
