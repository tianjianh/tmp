The exhibition in the Queen's Gallery is called Maria Merian's Butterflies.
It marks the 300th anniversary of the death of German artist and scientist Maria Sibylla Merian.
Among the works are images acquired by George III for his scientific library in Buckingham House, later Buckingham Palace, which are part of the Royal Collection.
