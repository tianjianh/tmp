[SN]TITLE[SN]
Three men from Netherlands deny ambulance drugs charges

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Three men have denied helping to smuggle a multimillion-pound haul of drugs into the UK in an ambulance.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Leonardus Bijlsma, Dennis Vogelaar and Richard Engelsbel, all from Amsterdam or nearby in the Netherlands, denied a joint charge of conspiracy to smuggle.
They were charged in June after cocaine and heroin were found in a Dutch-registered ambulance in Smethwick in the West Midlands.
Olaf Schoon, 38, from Hoofddorp, will enter a plea on 6 November.
He was arrested at the same time as the others.
Mr Bijlsma, 55, Mr Vogelaar, 28, and Mr Engelsbel, 51, are also alleged to have conspired with Mr Schoon and others to import drugs over the period between April 2014 and June 2015.
The men appeared at Birmingham Crown Court and were remanded in custody to face trial on 16 November.
