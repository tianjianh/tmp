How bad have Southern rail services got?

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Commuters in south London and southern England are facing days of disruption on the Southern rail network amid a long-running strike over the role of conductors and the operation of driver-only trains.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Staff walked out on a number of days in December and for three 48 hour-periods this week. Further strike action is planned for 23, 24, 25 and 27 January.
The RMT union's members first walked out in April and have since been joined by members of drivers' union Aslef, making the dispute the longest-running rail strike since the railways were privatised in 1996.  Govia Thameslink Railway, Southern's parent company, has said it will take Aslef to the Supreme Court over the industrial action.
With customer satisfaction at a low of 69% - the bottom of the passenger satisfaction table - just how bad have things got for Southern's customers?
According to the official performance data published by Network Rail and the Office of Rail and Road,  28.9% of Southern's Mainline and Coast services were late (more than five minutes of the scheduled arrival time for commuter services) in the year to 10 December 2016. That's almost three in every 10 services.
However, if the latest-available figures - from 13 November to 10 December - are taken in isolation, the percentage of late-running trains rises to 43.3%. This is 10% higher than the previous period (16 October to 12 November).
The national average for 13 November to 10 December was 20.9%.
In fact, all lines run by Southern's parent company, Govia Thameslink Railway, were in the bottom six of the list for the latest period (Southern Metro, Great Northern, Gatwick Express, Southern Mainline and Coast and Thameslink), with between 32.1% and 43.3% of trains arriving late at their destinations.
*This is the Public Performance Measure (PPM) - the industry standard measure that monitors trains arriving within five minutes of scheduled arrival times for commuter services or 10 minutes for long-distance services. "Cancelled or significantly late" means cancelled trains or those arriving more than 30 minutes after a scheduled arrival time.

On Wednesday 11 January, the second strike day this week, Southern's own daily performance chart showed 60% of its Southern Mainline services were arriving late. That's six out of every 10 services.
Meanwhile, the top performer nationally during the latest four-week period of 13 November to 10 December, was London Overground - with only 4.5% of its London services late. Merseyrail Electrics Northern line also performed well, with just 6.9% late-running trains.

Looking further back over the last two years, Southern's Mainline and Coast performance has fluctuated, but delays have increased since the beginning of this year, according to the three official measures.
Using the Public Performance Measure (trains arriving late by more than five minutes), Southern's best performance since April 2014 was attained over the summer of that year - 10.3% of trains late. It has never attained that figure since.
Its worst period was between 29 May and 26 June this year, with 44.2% - almost half - of its services running late by more than five minutes. Some 68.6% (almost seven in 10) of trains were running more than 59 seconds late and 23.6% (almost a quarter) of services were cancelled or arriving more than 30 minutes late.
The latest National Rail Passenger Survey, released in Spring 2016, showed the lowest ratings for overall passenger satisfaction were given to Southern (69%) and Southeastern (69%), closely followed by Great Northern (74%), Thameslink (74%) and Abellio Greater Anglia (77%). Southern, Great Northern and Thameslink are all run by Govia Thameslink Railway.

Nationally, the highest ratings for overall satisfaction were achieved by Grand Central (96%), First Hull Trains (94%), Virgin Trains (92%), Chiltern Railways (91%) and Heathrow Express (91%).
With Southern drivers from the Aslef union continuing with their overtime ban and further walkouts planned, the disruption for passengers looks likely to continue.
Southern has warned that "in addition to the strike days, services on all routes will be severely disrupted on all dates until further notice"
Affected services are listed on Southern's website.

Rail performance is measured in a number of ways. There are targets on punctuality, reliability, causes of delay, asset failures and disruption to the network from planned engineering work. Official statistics, published by the Office of Rail and Road, include the following indicators regarding punctuality and reliability:
The rail industry reports data on a periodic basis rather than the more recognised reporting cycles such as monthly or quarterly. A period is normally a 28-day, or four weekly period for business reporting purposes (Sunday to Saturday) and there are 13 periods in a financial year.
