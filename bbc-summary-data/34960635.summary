Mitchell Starc: Injury rules Australia bowler out of West Indies series

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Australia left-arm fast bowler Mitchell Starc has been ruled out of the upcoming three-Test series against West Indies with a broken foot.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Starc suffered a stress fracture during the third Test against New Zealand.
Wearing a protective boot, he told reporters: "I'll be in this boot for three or four weeks."
The West Indies series begins on 9 December in Hobart, and Starc could also miss the return series against the Black Caps in New Zealand in February.
"There's no point putting a time stamp on it yet until the bone heals," he said.
Starc was the joint-leading wicket-taker in the series against the Kiwis - won 2-0 by Australia - with 13.
But his injury further depletes their pace bowling resources following the retirement of fellow left-arm quick Mitchell Johnson midway through the New Zealand series.
