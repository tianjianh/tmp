The 21-year-old was part of the Hibs side that finished runner-up in the Scottish Women's Premier League and lost the Scottish Cup final last term.
"She ticks all the boxes in terms of the standard of players that we want at Bristol," said manager Willie Kirk.
Arthur is the second player to join Bristol this week after Ellie Wilson arrived from Reading on Wednesday.
