Bolton 'opposed to fracking', says council leader Cliff Morris

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The leader of Bolton Council has vowed to oppose any attempt to begin fracking in the region, describing the drilling technique as "a scar on the landscape".

The government recently approved applications for tests to be carried out in areas including parts of Horwich, Blackrod and Astley Bridge.
But council leader Cliff Morris said the authority will remain "absolutely" opposed to the scheme.
He said: "The area covered is some of our most beautiful countryside."
However, he admitted that his stance may not ultimately prevent the government from approving fracking projects in Bolton - after ministers recently declared they could bypass local authorities' opposition.
During a full council meeting, Mr Morris was asked by Liberal Democrat councillor Andrew Martin if it was inevitable that the new Conservative government would fast-track fracking applications.
He replied: "It's a difficult one because it is up to the government.
"But they will know now the feelings of the residents and the councillors at this time.
"There is a head of steam among our residents because this is a scar on the landscape.
"We are saying 'no thank you, we don't want any fracking in Bolton, especially not the areas you have designated."
Fracking is a technique for extracting gas or oil trapped between layers of rock by forcing the layers open using water under high pressure.
Anti-fracking campaigners are concerned about the effects of the process and the waste water generated.
Applications to carry out fracking in parts of Lancashire sparked widespread protests earlier this year, before the proposals were rejected.
