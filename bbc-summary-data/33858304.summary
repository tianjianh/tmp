Pilgrims boss Derek Adams said he thought it was "unfair" the Cumbrians were having to make the journey to the south-west coast on a Tuesday evening.
His side showed no such mercy as they took a 4-0 lead thanks to a double from Jake Jervis and a goal each for Reuben Reid and Graham Carey.

One female Carlisle fan who travelled to Home Park told BBC Radio 5 live: "We're a bunch of hardy souls. It's nothing that we haven't been used to before. We're just astounded at the amount of interest there's been in this trip.
"For us, it's a trip we were going to have to make to watch them whenever it was going to be. It's a standard ordinary away trip for Carlisle fans because of where we are geographically.
"I don't know who came up with putting it on a Tuesday night, but I'd like to have a little word with them.
"We applauded that one goal as if it was the winner. The reception that the players gave the fans, and vice-versa when the players came off the pitch - they were shaking hands with fans, saying thank you for coming and supporting them."
