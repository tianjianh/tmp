[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The London stock market has closed lower after jitters over Brexit hit banking and retail shares.

The benchmark FTSE 100 finished down 0.12%, or 8.52 points, at 7358.56.
On Monday the UK parliament backed the government's Brexit bill, paving the way for formal negotiations to be triggered.
However, shares in Prudential rose 2.8% as strong growth in its Asian business helped its group operating profits to rise 7% to Â£4.3bn.
But the rise in Prudential shares did not stop the wider market from edging down.
Markets were jittery about the imminent triggering of Brexit negotiations and Scotland's call for a second independence referendum.
Bank shares were under pressure, with Royal Bank of Scotland down 2.5% and Lloyds more than 2% lower.
Big retail and banking stocks have been particularly sensitive to political developments, as has the pound.
On the currency markets, the pound fell to an eight-week low against the dollar, dropping 0.5% to $1.2157.
Against the euro, the pound was down 0.4% at 1.1430 euros.
