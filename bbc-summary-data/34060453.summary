[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The leader of one of the UK's biggest trade unions has had his vote in the Labour leadership election rejected.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Mark Serwotka, general secretary of the Public and Commercial Services (PCS) union, voted for Jeremy Corbyn, but was told his vote would not be counted.
Mr Serwotka has previously publicly criticised Labour's "move rightwards".
Labour said it would not comment on individual cases but said people "who don't share aims of values of the Labour party don't get a vote".
The PCS, which represents civil servants, is not affiliated to the Labour Party.
Mr Serwotka's wife Ruth  tweeted about the vote saying: "Mark been prevented from voting in a Labour Movement election as an affiliated member. I'm very interested to hear the reasons. #LabourPurge".
In an interview with the New Statesman in 2011, he said he had voted for the Green Party in the 2010 election and added: "Growing up in Wales, it was Labour, Labour, Labour. But [since] its move rightwards and embrace of the markets, Labour doesn't speak for me."
Mr Serwotka is among 3,200 people who have been prevented from voting in the leadership election after signing up as affiliated members.
