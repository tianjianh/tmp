Young Sports Personality 2016: Rebekah Tiler Q&A

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Weightlifter Rebekah Tiler is among the Young Sports Personality nominees for the fourth year in a row.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 17-year-old was Team GB's only female weightlifter at the Rio 2016 Olympic Games, finishing in 10th place.
That came after she won three bronzes (overall bronze, as well as individual medals in the snatch - with a best of 99kg and 123kg in the clean and jerk) at the European Weightlifting Championships in April,.
Rebekah started weightlifting at the age of 12, when one of her coaches noticed her strength and she switched from sprinting.  Since then, she has broken a whole host of records during her career.
Here, Rebekah answers questions set by BBC News School Reporters from Aston Manor Academy in Birmingham.
If you weren't an athlete, what would you want to be and why?
I'd like to be an actress - I always enjoyed drama at school and I think it'd be cool to be in an action movie!
What or who made you get into sport?
My parents - they took me along to local clubs and always encouraged and supported me in my training.
What do you like to do to relax when you aren't busy training?
I like to go on long walks with my family in the Dales and spend time with my friends, go shopping and do normal things!
Who is your biggest inspiration?
No-one in particular - I admire people who have achieved what I want to do in the future - and that's becoming Olympic champion!

Describe what a typical day of training is like for you
I train twice a day, two hours each session, five times a week. In the morning's session, I mainly focus on strengthening exercises and in the afternoon, I move into full lifts.
What keeps you motivated to train?
My end goal - to become Olympic champion!
(Other than yourself!) who do you think is a brilliant role model for aspiring athletes?
This is a good question! I think it depends on the sport - for me, I've always looked up to Jessica Ennis. I also started out as a sprinter and I really admire what she's achieved.
What do you think is the biggest myth about being a successful sportsperson?
I don't think many people realise how important it is to have a balanced lifestyle - yes you have to train hard and focus on your diet but it's also really important to get some downtime and make sure that you have some normality in your day-to-day life.
What do you eat in the day to keep you fuelled for training?
It's important to have a good breakfast - usually porridge or Weetabix. Then lunch is often steak with jacket potato or white rice and for dinner I usually have chicken or fish with veg. After training I'll have a protein shake and during the day I'll also snack on healthy foods like fruit.
What advice would you give to other young people wanting to get into competitive sports?
Try it - you never know how good you'll be at something unless you give it a go. Make sure you give 100% in what you do and don't worry about what others think - as long as you're enjoying it!
What kind of support network do you think you need in the sports industry?
Having a big support network is really important - this includes coaching staff, physios, nutritionists and sponsors. Family and friends are also a big part of this.
How do you feel before a major event or competition and how do you manage your nerves?
It depends on the competition - if it's in the UK and especially in the north (where I'm from), I get really excited, but if it's abroad and I'm representing GB I tend to get more nervous. To manage this I take lots of deep breaths and make sure I listen to my coach Eddie. I then focus on going out and doing my best!
Do you have a certain ritual or routine you follow before a competition and if so what?
I don't really have one particular thing I do - I do always wear my hair the same though and I lift my feet up before I walk out on to the platform.
What is your 'golden moment' so far in your career?
It has to be competing at the Olympics in Rio - I was so proud to be able to not only represent my country, but also female weightlifters.
What is/was your favourite subject at school and why?
PE - I really enjoyed it, found it pretty easy and I enjoyed beating everyone!
