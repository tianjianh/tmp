[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Joshua Kimmich struck with two minutes left as Bundesliga leaders Bayern Munich kept up a 100% start under Carlo Ancelotti at struggling Hamburg.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Kimmich turned in Franck Ribery's low cross from close range, just as the home side looked set for a point.
Home goalkeeper Rene Adler had made a series of fine saves, most notably from Robert Lewandowski's close-range shot.
Bayern did suffer a setback when centre-back Mats Hummels came off with a knee injury soon after half-time.
Hummels will be assessed before Wednesday's Champions League trip to Atletico Madrid.
Hamburg coach Bruno Labbadia, a former Bayern striker, has been under intense scrutiny after his team's poor start to the season, with just one point taken from four matches before Saturday.
There had been suggestions that Labbadia, who saved Hamburg from relegation two seasons ago, could lose his job if his players failed to perform against the champions.
As it was, the home side put it a spirited display, despite falling to a fourth successive league defeat.
Bayern had the bulk of the possession, and turned up the pressure considerably after a sleepy first half.
But Adler was inspired - reacting brilliantly early in the second half when Lewandowski turned Thiago's corner goalwards, and later beating away a David Alaba free-kick before turning Thomas Muller's effort wide.
Lewandowski also had a penalty appeal rejected as Emir Spahic seemed to drag him back when he was clear, but Bayern found a way to score as time was running out.
Match ends, Hamburger SV 0, FC Bayern München 1.
