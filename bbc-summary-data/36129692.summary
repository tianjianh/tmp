David Price: 'Cheated' boxer criticises IBF ranking before return

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Britain's David Price believes he should be reinstated into the IBF's top 15 fighters after his last opponent Erkan Teper was banned for doping.

Price was knocked out in the second round by Teper last July, but the German then failed a post-fight drugs test and was banned for two years.
Teper is still ranked third by the IBF, while Price, who was ranked fifth last June, is no longer in the top 15.
"I have been cheated and I deserve something back," said Price, 32.
Former British and Commonwealth heavyweight champion Price has not fought since the defeat by Teper in Germany.
But he is set to make his comeback on the undercard of Tony Bellew's fight with Ilunga Makabu on 29 May.
Speaking to BBC Sport, Price said: "The very least should be once I'm active again and winning, Teper is removed and I'm reinstated back into the top 15.
"Instead of being put to the back of the queue, I deserve to be back where I was before I was cheated. In any other sport that would happen."
The Liverpudlian added: "There's opportunities awaiting ranked fighters and I won't be denied because I've been cheated."
Price has three defeats in his 22 professional fights.
As well as losing to Teper, he was beaten twice by American Tony Thompson, who also failed a drugs test after beating the Englishman.
The European Boxing Union took away Teper's European heavyweight title but maintained the original result of the fight.
The IBF told BBC Sport it would recognise any formal suspension of Teper from the EBU or German Boxing Commission, if that happened.
Teper will be removed from the rankings next month due to "inactivity" given he has not fought since facing Price.
Olympic bronze medallist Price added: "As far as dealing with drugs cheats is concerned, boxing is in the dark ages. It is just common sense. If someone cheats in a fight, then their results should be scratched.
"In athletics, if the winner is banned for drugs, the person who finishes second gets the medal. It's so simple to do."
The British Boxing Board of Control said it "supports" Price and will be discussing the matter with the IBF, EBU and Price's management.
The BBBofC will consider a rule change at its annual general meeting in June.
The proposal is that the results of fights in which a boxer is subsequently banned for doping are changed to a no contest.
The EBU executive will also discuss Price's situation when they meet in the same month.
IBF world heavyweight champion Anthony Joshua will make the first defence of his title against American Dominic Breazeale, ranked 13th, on 25 June.
Price added: "It could have been me getting a title shot - two Olympic medallists against each other - but it's a big fight I have been cheated out of.
"I have missed out on this opportunity, but I still hold out hope later in the year."
