'Being born in Wales' makes you Welsh, poll says

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Most Welsh people think you have to be born in Wales to be Welsh, new research has said.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Only a third (33%) of people believed being able to speak Welsh made someone Welsh, according to the study by internet-based market research firm YouGov.
In a survey of more than 1,000 people in Wales, more than 90% thought being born in the country made someone Welsh.
Second on the list was having two Welsh parents, with 87% backing the option.
The only other factors to gain majority support were "growing up in Wales" (68%) and having a Welsh parent (61%).
Only about four in 10 people believed someone "considering themselves Welsh" made them Welsh.
Matthew Smith, of YouGov, said: "What makes a person Welsh is a question that raged for a while - especially in light of sports stars representing the country despite seemingly having light links with it.
"However, it is clear from our research that what makes a person Welsh is quite a broad church.
"The key thing seems to be a person's heritage - be it being born in Wales, having a Welsh parent or growing up here."
YouGov carried out online interviews with 1,005 adults aged 18 or over in Wales between 23 and 27 September.
