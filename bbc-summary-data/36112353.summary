[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A kitten abandoned in an Ikea superstore car park in Essex has found a new home.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Five-month-old half-Bengal Vinnie was discovered in a cat carrier containing toys and food at the store in Thurrock.
A note on the basket said his owner could not keep him "for personal reasons" and he was "very sad".
The RSPCA said the kitten's carrier could easily have been crushed by a car. After dozens read Vinnie's story on Facebook a new owner has been found.
The note left with the kitten went on to say: "I am totally loveable, enjoying long cuddles/snuggles."
More than 100 people commented after an appeal was put out by the RSPCA to find the kitten's owner.
Many were critical of the woman for leaving her unwanted pet in a busy car park.
The RSPCA said it was "delighted" to have now found a "new, loving home" for Vinnie but urged people to take pets to one of their shelters, or other rescue centres rather than abandoning them.
