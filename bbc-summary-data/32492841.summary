[SN]TITLE[SN]
Injured tortoise, 90, fitted with wheels

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A Pembrokeshire tortoise, whose legs were hurt by a rat, has been fitted with wheels to help her get around.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 90-year-old tortoise, called Mrs T, had been placed in a garden shed to hibernate for winter, when the rat injured her.
Mrs T's owner, Jude Ryder, paid Â£1,000 in vet bills before turning to her mechanical engineer son for help.
He used the wheels from a toy plane and designed an axle which he fitted to the tortoise's shell.
Ms Ryder said: "She took to her new wheels straight away but she has had to learn how to turn and stop.
"She can get a good speed up, much faster than before."
Please remember if you find any injured animals, tell your parent or guardian.
