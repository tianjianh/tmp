Calum Clark: Northampton flanker gets three-week ban for striking opponent

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Northampton flanker Calum Clark has been banned for three weeks after pleading guilty to striking Worcester's Donncha O'Callaghan with his elbow.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The first-half incident had gone unpunished during Friday's Premiership match, but he was later cited.
Later in the game, Clark, 27, was yellow-carded for bundling a Warriors player into touch off the ball.
He will miss league matches against Newcastle and Leicester, and the Champions Cup game against Leinster.
"The panel found this was not a premeditated act but an intentional strike to the head of an opponent that merited a mid-range entry point of three weeks," an RFU statement read.
"The player's remorse before the panel was genuine and heartfelt."
