Wales interim head coach Rob Howley: "There were too many unforced errors in our game [v Scotland] from 40 to 55 minutes, after a really dominant first half on the back of one of the best games in the Six Nations against England.
"Obviously, I know things have been said in the week about some players' performance. But as a coaching team, we have talked about the opportunity just to go out again.
"There is an opportunity to go out at home in front of our own supporters and deliver a performance which the players are proud of and for the supporters to support that. It will be a huge game."
Ireland head coach Joe Schmidt: "Some of what we didn't do so well against France, we must do better against Wales.
"For us it is about tidying up bits and pieces rather than saying 'Here is a list of things we need to do better'.
"We are trying to focus on what we are doing well, harness that and improve to keep pressure on opponents."
