Spalding murders: 'Toxic relationship' behind killing of mum and daughter

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The killing of a mother and daughter would not have happened if two teenagers had not formed an "intense, toxic relationship", a court has heard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Elizabeth Edwards, 49, and her 13-year-old daughter Katie were found stabbed to death at their home in Spalding, Lincolnshire in April.
A 15-year-old girl has admitted manslaughter but denies murder on the grounds of diminished responsibility.
A 15-year-old boy has already pleaded guilty to murder.
Consultant forensic psychiatrist Dr Philip Joseph told a jury at Nottingham Crown Court the bond between the couple had been the catalyst for the killings.
He told jurors: "If they had not had this intense, toxic relationship this would never have happened. It is the relationship that is behind the killings."
Dr Joseph said that during his interview with the girl in September 2016 she said she had first become aware of her boyfriend in 2013 but they did not begin a relationship until May 2015.
She told the psychiatrist that she and the boy had the "same attitude to life".
She said things had initially gone well between the couple, saying she had "felt happy for once" and it was "the closest I've ever felt to anyone".
Dr Joseph described the girl as being "inappropriately upbeat" and "cheerful" during the two-and-a-half hour interview.
When he asked her how she and the boy had felt after killing the two women she said: "We felt laid back about what we had done and neither of us felt that bad about it."
He said she had described the couple's plans to commit suicide after the killings as "half-hearted" and that "for some reason" it did not happen.
When asked if she thought there was something wrong with her she told him: "Everything is wrong with me. For a 15-year-old girl to be talking about it like it was a breeze means there must be something wrong with me."
Asked about the diagnosis of Dr Indranil Chakrabarti who had earlier told the court that the girl had been suffering from a mental disorder, Dr Joseph said he did not believe the diagnosis was correct.
He went on to say that even if she had been suffering from such a disorder it would not have impaired her ability to understand her conduct or make rational decisions.
"I disagree with the diagnosis and even if she did have some form of adjustment disorder it had no link to the killing," he said.
"She was not suffering from an adjustment disorder nor was she suffering from any other psychiatric condition.
"To suggest that anyone who kills has impaired rational judgement, the law says that is complete nonsense.
"[Somebody with such a disorder] might lash out but it would be an outburst, an uncontrolled act, but I've never heard of a case of a planned killing as a result of an adjustment disorder."
Earlier, psychiatrist Dr Chakrabarti told Nottingham Crown Court the girl had been suffering from a mental disorder at the time of the killings that meant she was incapable of forming rational thoughts.
Under cross-examination from prosecutor Peter Joyce QC, he agreed she had been excited about the killing and said she had felt "relieved" after the murders, but he rejected claims she was "glad" the women were dead.
Dr Chakrabarti admitted there was planning but said the defendant's thinking had been "impaired by the mental disorder".
He said: "I do not think that killing two people is rational thinking in any way."
He added that as a result of the disorder he believed "she did not understand her conduct" at the time of the killings.
He told the jury: "She knew she was going to kill them but what I understand is that she was unable to understand her conduct and what consequences that meant for the victims."
During the assessment the girl had appeared "relieved but not remorseful" as a result of the killings, the court was told.
Prior to his assessment, the girl had not previously been assessed as having any mental illnesses.
The trial continues.
