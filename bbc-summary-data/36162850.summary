The incident between a 999 ambulance and a patient care service ambulance happened on the A499, north of Y Ffor, on Thursday afternoon.
John Clift, 54, from Pwllheli, was driving the patient care service ambulance and died at the scene.
In a tribute, his family said he was "well known and liked by many people".
Mr Clift had worked for Pwllheli Fire and Rescue Service for 26 years and a patient care services driver for the NHS, based in Pwllheli, for 12 years.
"To his family he was a loving partner to Hilary, stepdad to Matthew and Ceri, adoring taid to Hannah, brother to Pat and David, uncle to Sharon, Tracy, William, Mark, Phillip, Steven and Jamie," the tribute added.
"When not working he liked nothing more than spending time with his family and watching his favourite Manchester City football team on television.
"He was well known and liked by many people in the local area and he will be greatly missed by everyone."
Wayne Davies, the Welsh Ambulance Service's locality manager for Anglesey and Gwynedd, added: "John was a reliable and trustworthy individual, who was truly one of the team.
"He will be sadly missed by all of his colleagues in Pwllheli and the wider Welsh Ambulance Service family."
Three people in the other vehicle were taken to Ysbyty Gwynedd in Bangor with serious injuries.
North Wales Police is investigating and has appealed for witnesses.
The Welsh Ambulance Service said it would support staff in Pwllheli and the wider Gwynedd area "over the coming days".
Sonia Thompson, the trust's head of operations in north Wales, said: "We were all absolutely devastated to hear about this tragic accident and our thoughts are with everyone involved.
"We're doing everything we can to support our affected colleagues and are working hard to understand what happened."
Union Unison regional secretary Margaret Thomas said the incident had devastated staff at the ambulance service and she paid tribute to paramedics and technicians who attended the accident scene.
