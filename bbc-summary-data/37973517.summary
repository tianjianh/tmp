Danielle Carr-Gomm, 71, of Lewes, East Sussex, died at Cleeve House in Seend, Wiltshire, on 20 October, it has emerged.
She was taking part in a workshop involving paida lajin therapy.
Two men, aged 51 and 53, and a woman, 64, were arrested on suspicion of manslaughter and later released on bail, police said.
An inquest was opened and adjourned at Salisbury Coroner's Court on Friday.
A Wiltshire Police spokeswoman said: "Police were called to an address in Seend in the early hours of 20 October following the sudden death of a woman.
"A post mortem has been carried out but the results were inconclusive. We await further toxicology tests."
A spokesman for Cleeve House said: "This was a very sad and shocking event.
"We are very sorry for the lady and her family."
Paida lajin involves patients being slapped or vigorously slapping themselves repeatedly as part of a "self-healing" process.
The weeklong course Mrs Carr-Gomm attended was run by Hongchi Xiao, originally from Beijing.
In a previous blog entry, Mrs Carr-Gomm described attending one of his paid lajin courses in Bulgaria and said "the results are totally astonishing and encouraging".
She said the end of the first sessions saw "large areas of my body... bruised and blue which indicated that a lot of 'sha' or poisoned blood and toxins had been released".
She also described vomiting "the most horrible syrupy black stuff" and suffering painful seizures, but said it improved her blood sugar readings and she planned to attend more group workshops.
