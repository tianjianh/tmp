[SN]TITLE[SN]
Scaled-back Galloway Hills wind farm plan submitted

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A renewable energy developer has submitted a revised plan for a proposed wind farm in the Galloway Hills.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
It would see 12 turbines constructed - four fewer than previously planned.
Element Power's scaled-back plan for its Windy Rig development follows "substantial" consultation with the council and Scottish Natural Heritage.
Additional environmental information has been submitted to support the application and it is now subject to a 28-day consultation.
The site lies on the Moorbrock Estate to the north east of Carsphairn and is near a cluster of other wind energy developments.
Each of the proposed 12 turbines would be up to 125m (410ft) in height.
The revisions made to the application - including changes to the layout - have been designed to limit the visual impact of the development.
