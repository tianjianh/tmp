The victim was dragged across the ground and pushed to the floor before his attacker ran away with the stick.
Police have said the pensioner is now too traumatised to return to work.
Staff and pupils at the nearby Gosford Park Primary School have called him an "asset to the community" and wished him a "speedy recovery".
