Rafael Benitez: Championship title race still open - Newcastle manager

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Newcastle United manager Rafael Benitez says the Championship title race is far from decided, despite Tuesday's 2-1 win against fellow contenders Brighton.

Ayoze Perez scored a late winner as the Magpies moved two points clear of Albion at the top.
Benitez's side have won four and drawn three of their past seven games in the second tier.
"I said before this was just an important game but we have to play a lot of them," Benitez said.
"It's three points but there are lots of games and lots of points."
The Spaniard said that April would be the crucial month of the campaign in the build up to Tuesday's game, and his opinion was unaffected despite a key win against their nearest challengers.
Newcastle scored twice in the final 10 minutes to snatch the points on the south coast, as Mohamed Diame and substitute Perez completed a comeback after Glenn Murray's spot-kick put the hosts ahead.
"You could see we needed to change little bit to get more impact," said Benitez, who sent on striker Daryl Murphy before Diame's equaliser.
"It gave us fresh legs and different movements, but I was pleased with the players that had been on the field."
