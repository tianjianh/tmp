A seven-wicket win over New Zealand took Morgan's side into Sunday's final against India or West Indies - 12 months after England exited the World Cup at the group stage.
"Everybody involved has worked tirelessly to get us to this stage and to get us to play in this fashion," Morgan said.
"We've come out and we've delivered."
England have won 19 out of 31 limited-overs games since the World Cup - including nine out of 12 Twenty20 matches - with much of their improvement down to a more aggressive and enterprising approach, especially from the batsmen.
And Morgan says the team will be told to continue to play that way in the final on Delhi.
"The later the stage you get to at a World Cup, the more licence you have as a team and as individuals to go out and express yourself as much as you can, so we'll be encouraging our guys to go out and do that," he said.
Batsman Jason Roy, who hit 78 in England's chase, described the achievement as "overwhelming".
"A lot of hard work has gone into it by all the team and to be in a final with this group of boys is extremely special," he said.
Roy averaged just 13 in this format before the World Twenty20, but is now the tournament's third-highest run scorer.
"People who don't realise how much hard work you put in in the nets and how tough it is mentally," he said.
"I am glad I have been able to right those wrongs and gain a few more people who back me."
