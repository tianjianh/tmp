[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Two Islamist militants have been sentenced to two years in prison for breaching the Terrorism Act act by leaving the UK illegally.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Trevor Brooks and Simon Keeler from east London both admitted failing to inform the police of their intention to leave the UK.
They were deported from Hungary after being found on a train headed for Bucharest, Romania, in November 2015.
The sentencing judge described it as a "serious and deliberate" offence.
Keeler, 44, of Shadwell, and Brooks, also known as Abu Izzadeen, 40, of Clapton, were subject to special requirements meaning they had to notify the police if they were leaving the country for longer than three days.
Restrictions had been imposed on them after they were each imprisoned for three years and six months for funding and inciting terrorism in 2008.
The men stowed away on a lorry in London in November last year and had crossed the channel at Dover.
Neither of them had passports and neither appeared on any passenger manifest as leaving the UK.
The court heard the men were carrying almost Â£8,000 in  sterling, euros and Hungarian forint, as well as provisions including socks, toothpaste, toothbrushes and "outdoor clothing".
The judge, Mr Justice Saunders, took into account their early guilty pleas and told the men that he did not sentence them "on the basis that the defendants were travelling in order to commit a terrorist offence or that they were preparing a terrorist offence either in this country or abroad".
He added: "That does not mean that these offences are not serious."
The court had heard that Keeler said he was attempting to travel to Turkey to visit his wife and children and the Brooks had accompanied him in order to help him find them.
The men, who have been associated with the radical Islamist group al-Muhajiroun, both have a number of previous convictions.
Keeler was sentenced to 28 days in 1999 for assaulting a police officer and in July last year was found guilty of possessing false identity documents.
Brooks was jailed for a second time in 2015 for failing to notify the police of a change of address.
He also famously heckled the then Home Secretary John Reid during a speech in 2006.
