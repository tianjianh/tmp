The 23-times Isle of Man TT winner will again ride Honda machinery as he moves ever closer to the late Joey Dunlop's all-time record of 26 wins.
Speaking at the event's launch in Douglas, he said he would be "disappointed" not to add to his tally.
The 43-year-old won both the Senior race and TT Zero class in 2015.
On his way to victory in a shortened four-lap race Senior race, he also set a new absolute course record of 132.701mph in the process.
His victory took him level with Mike Hailwood's record of seven Senior race triumphs.
McGuinness, who turns 44 this week, said: "I feel strong. I'm not the fittest guy in the world but when I get on the bike I feel 21 again".
"I spoke to Joey's wife last week and she gave me the family's blessing. Joey was a national treasure and it might upset some if I caught his record, but records are there to be broken.
Joey Dunlop died in Tallinn, Estonia, in 2000 while leading a 125cc race - his death coming just weeks after he secured a hat-trick of TT wins - aged 48.
McGuinness will be competing in six races at this year's event, which will be his 20th year of competing.
He added: "Even with all my experience, I will still have butterflies - you never know what will happen and the quality of the field is getting better every year."
"I 100% want to win and I believe I can. I will be disappointed if I don't reach the top step this year."
