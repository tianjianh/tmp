Lincoln County Hospital has also restricted admissions to five more wards following the outbreak.
United Lincolnshire Hospitals NHS Trust, which manages the hospital, said the ward closures were to prevent the virus spreading.
The trust declined to specify which wards were shut, but said no children's wards had been affected.
Michelle Rhodes, director of nursing at the trust, said the "highly contagious" virus could spread rapidly in hospitals.
"Symptoms of norovirus include diarrhoea and vomiting and, just like flu, the virus can seriously affect vulnerable patients," she said.
"If you have norovirus symptoms, please do not attend A&E. The best thing you can do is rest and take plenty of non-caffeinated drinks to avoid dehydration."
A trust spokesman said some areas of the hospital were expected to reopen following deep cleaning over the next few days.
