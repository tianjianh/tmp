Applications from members must be submitted by 16 September, with interviews held ahead of the selection of a shortlist.
A hustings event will take place on 23 September, with the by-election expected to be held on 20 October.
Mrs Cox was shot and stabbed in Birstall, West Yorkshire on 16 June.
Last month, former television soap star Tracy Brabin told the BBC she was considering putting her name forward to become the Labour candidate.
The ex-Coronation Street, EastEnders and Emmerdale actress' Twitter handle has now been changed to @Tracy4MP.
The Conservatives, Liberal Democrats and UKIP have all said they will not be fielding a candidate in the by-election.
However, Liberty GB and English Democrats have both announced plans to contest the seat.
Thomas Mair, 52, was charged with murder in relation to the death of Mrs Cox and is due to go on trial in November.
He was also charged with grievous bodily harm, possession of a firearm with intent to commit an indictable offence and possession of an offensive weapon.
