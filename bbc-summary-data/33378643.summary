Burntisland and Methil in Fife and Arnish on Lewis have missed out on contracts supported by the Scottish government, unions have said.
The sites operated by BiFab employ a total of 2,500 workers.
Alasdair Allan, SNP MSP for the Western Isles, said the first minister's office was making arrangements for a meeting.
The GMB and Unite said they have had to make repeated requests for a meeting with Ms Sturgeon.
Mr Allan told BBC Radio Scotland: "I am happy to confirm that there will be a meeting between representatives of the workforce and the first minister. That is something her office is presently arranging."
He said the yard at Arnish near Stornoway was an important and major employer in the area.
A Scottish government spokeswoman said: "The request for a meeting with the first minister has been received and will be responded to shortly.
"The Scottish government will continue to do everything we can to safeguard jobs and ensure that in the current challenging times for the oil and gas and related sectors, we provide the support they need to continue to contribute strongly to the economy."
The three yards build modules for the oil and gas industry.
In February, Bifab held talks with Highlands and Islands Enterprise and Scottish Enterprise on how jobs at Arnish could be safeguarded during a downturn in the UK oil and gas industry.
