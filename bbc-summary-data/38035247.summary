[SN]TITLE[SN]
AFC Wimbledon 2-2 Fleetwood Town

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Conor McLaughlin snatched a deserved point at the death for Fleetwood as they drew at AFC Wimbledon.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The visitors took an early lead through Cian Bolger, but the Dons battled back when Tom Elliott climbed off the bench at half-time to equalise and win a penalty, which Dean Parrett converted, before McLaughlin headed in Jack Sowerby's corner.
Bolger opened the scoring on 12 minutes when he powered home a corner for his first league goal of the season.
Fleetwood were dominant and the lead was almost doubled when Bobby Grant beat James Shea from 25 yards, only to see his effort crash against the far post.
But the Dons came out fighting in the second half, and Elliott had an instant impact as his header from Parrett's corner deflected in.
And they looked to have sealed the win 15 minutes from time when Parrett sent Alex Cairns the wrong way, after Joe Davis had fouled Elliott.
However, Fleetwood would not lie down and continued to apply pressure, getting their reward through McLaughlin in time added on.
