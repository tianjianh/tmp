French international Paul Pogba shared a picture of himself in Mecca on Sunday, captioning it the "most beautiful thing I've seen in my life".
He also sent a tweet wishing everyone a "happy Ramadan".
The 24-year-old became the most expensive footballer in history last summer, after Manchester United paid Juventus a reported Â£89m ($114m) fee.
On Wednesday, he lifted the Europa League cup after Manchester United beat Ajax in the final in Stockholm.
How do footballers fast during Ramadan?
Following the end of the season, he shared a short video of himself with a suitcase, saying he was "en route" for his prayers. He is attending Umrah, a non-mandatory Muslim pilgrimage.
Pogba is reported to have visited Mecca at least once before, when he performed the Hajj, a journey every healthy adult Muslim who can afford it is supposed to make at least once in their lives.
