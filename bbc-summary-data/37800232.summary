If you're mourning the loss of Bake Off and you just don't know what to do with yourself we recommend you get your head in a book.

From Saturday morning, BBC Radio Ulster/Foyle's airwaves will be buzzing with interviews and features about reading for Book Week NI.
It is all part of a joint initiative between BBC Northern Ireland and Libraries NI.
The week aims to celebrate the pleasures and benefits of reading.
One of the key messages of the initiative is that books and reading are for everyone - even BBC NI's own Stephen Nolan.
Stephen met with Communities Minister Paul Givan this week at Belfast Central Library, where he became a member and got his own library card.
Mr Givan, who has responsibility for libraries across Northern Ireland said: "The NI Executive recognises the value of public libraries in communities and continues to provide support where possible."
On Monday morning Stephen Nolan will be launching "The Biggest Book Group in the Country".
Once a month, BBC Radio Ulster's The Nolan Show will give listeners the chance to share their views on that month's chosen book.
In the first of The Biggest Book Group in the Country, Charlie Lawson (also known as Big Jim McDonald from Coronation Street) will introduce and read some extracts from the group's first book - which will be revealed that morning.
Listeners will then have a month to read the book, before the programme discusses it at the end of November.
Steven Rainey will present Cover to Cover every weekday at 16:30.
The programme will feature interviews with a range of authors including Wilbur Smith, Jilly Cooper, Bernard Cornwell, Anne Rice, Nicci French and Ian Rankin.
It is often said everyone has at least one good novel in them but how do you get one published? Good Morning Ulster will be finding out how to get your name in print throughout the week.
On Gardeners' Corner, Cherrie McIlwaine will be joined by Wendy Austin as they visit Ormeau Library in Belfast to browse the shelves for books that will appeal to those with green fingers.
On Thursday, The Arts Show will be taking an in-depth look at local crime noir and, on Friday, Ralph McLean will be picking tracks inspired by his favourite music books.
Online, there will be a range of animations and videos including a series of new short films involving local personalities who will be talking about books that changed their life, their childhood favourites or their favourite book of the moment.
Book Week NI offers many opportunities for audiences to get involved, both on air, online and on social media using the tag #bookweekni.
