The 67-year-old is a life-long fan of Villa, who are six points adrift at the foot of the Premier League table.
"Mervyn successfully steered the Bank of England through the most turbulent economic headwinds in living memory," Villa chairman Steve Hollis said.
"His appointment to the board is a huge boost as we plan our path back to more successful times."
King, who was appointed a Life Peer in 2013, said he watched his first match at Villa Park more than 55 years ago.
"I shall do my best to help the rebuilding of Aston Villa Football Club as together we return it to its position as one of the top clubs in the world," he said.
King became president of Worcestershire County Cricket Club in 2015.
