Miriam Gonzalez said it was crucial to have a willing man when it came to organising childcare, she suggested.
Mr Clegg has talked about how he prioritises time with his three sons and does the school run before attending cabinet meetings.
Ms Gonzalez is a partner at law firm Dechert LLP.
She was attending the launch of "Inspiring Women in Scotland" whose aim is to bring together high-profile female role models and girls from state schools.
Asked about the importance of sharing childcare duties with her husband she said: "If you want to have children... if in a family you have children there is an issue if you want to work, as to how you are going to organise childcare.
"I think it was [Facebook boss] Sheryl Sandberg that said the most important decision in your life is who you have children with, so of course that is crucial.
"I am being asked all the time do you want to have it all, and, I don't want to have it all - I want to have what men have.
"So if many men have children and a job, and that's what they choose, I do not know why I cannot have that, if that's what I choose."
