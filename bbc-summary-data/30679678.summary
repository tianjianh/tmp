It follows an alleged row with a security guard before a show near Byron Bay on 2 January.
According to a police statement the Brooklyn rapper, 19, was walking towards the stage at The Falls Music and Arts Festival when he was asked to prove his identity.
Badass allegedly punched the 20-year-old guard, breaking his nose, before going on stage to perform his set.
The rapper, whose real name is Jo-Vaughn Virginie Scott, was later charged with assault causing bodily harm and spent the night in police custody, the statement added.
He could be sentenced to a maximum of five years in prison if convicted.
Badass appeared in Lismore Local Court on 3 January and was released on unconditional bail, court official Melissa Everson said.
She added that the rapper would not be required to appear when the charge is next listed in Byron Bay Local Court on 19 March. He is free to fly back to the United States and will be represented in court by a lawyer.
Everson would not say whether the rapper had entered a plea at this stage.
Badass, who is the co-founder of the hip-hop collective Pro Era, is set to play four shows in Australia and New Zealand over the next week.
