Is a Twenty20 specialist the best job in the world?

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Retired, ignored by the selectors and even exiled - what happens to the cast-out cricketers?

Well, they enjoy the high life; a world of sea, sun and sand, luxurious hotels, private planes, nightclubs and golf. Lots of golf. The catch? They still have to play some cricket along the way.
Welcome to the life of a Twenty20 specialist, probably the best job in the world.
July in the Caribbean, winter in South Africa and Australia and then spring in Dubai and India, perhaps even a summer in England.
A T20 specialist racks up plenty of air miles as they jet around the world playing in the Caribbean Premier League, Ram Slam, Big Bash, Pakistan Super League, Indian Premier League and the T20 Blast.
Former England batsman Kevin Pietersen is the 12th most expensive IPL player ever, once bought for $1.55m (Â£1.1m)
Each tournament he plays earns him another six-figure salary and that is before sponsorship and stints doing commentary and television.
"What some of us are doing now is the easiest gig in the world," he wrote in the Telegraph last year. "You turn up for a franchise, are well remunerated and then move on to your next contract."
When they are not thrilling the crowds on the pitch, T20 players make sure they enjoy themselves off it.
With a round of golf.
And plenty of relaxing.
Maybe see a whole new country and a bit of culture.
Plus a bit of quality family time.
And even meeting a celebrity.
Driving fast cars.
T20 cricket is all about team bonding....
...and a night out is always on the cards.
But of course it is all about the cricket.
Pietersen has recently reached three finals; at the Big Bash, Ram Slam and Pakistan Super League (though he lost all three).
While Chris Gayle hit the joint fastest ever half-century, needing just 12 balls to reach 50 in January.
