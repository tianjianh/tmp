[SN]TITLE[SN]
Anglia trains cancelled because of wheel damage caused to 'too light trains'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Train services across the East were cancelled because light diesel trains were being damaged by mulched leaves, a rail expert said.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Abellio Greater Anglia (AGA) had stopped services on lines between Norwich and Great Yarmouth, Ipswich, Felixstowe, Cambridge and Peterborough.
Philip Sutton, editor of Rail Exclusive, said leaves lodged in brakes cause "friction" damage.
AGA said up to two damaged trains per day were having to be withdrawn.
This had led to service cancellations across the network especially between Ipswich and Cambridge.
Also, trains being taken out of service caused rolling stock shortages which caused cancellations.
Mr Sutton said: "Trains are lighter now so they don't squash the leaves as the heavier trains used to.
"If leaves get caught in the brakes they burn and cause stresses on the wheel."
Network Rail, which is responsible for ensuring tracks are clear, said it was running extra rail clearing trains.
A spokesman said: "We are doing everything we can to minimise disruption and will continue to work with Abellio."
An AGA statement added: "The problems are due to some of our diesel trains suffering wheel damage, as a result of poor rail conditions."
The company said it is working with Network Rail to "improve rail conditions to prevent further damage" and restore a normal service.
