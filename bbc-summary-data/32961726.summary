Pensioner collects £240,000 winnings after election bet

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A Glasgow pensioner who bet £30,000 on a Conservative majority at the UK general election has collected his £240,000 winnings.

The man placed his bet at odds of 7/1 in a branch of Ladbrokes in the city centre on 29 April.
When the punter failed to immediately collect his £30,000 stake and £210,000 winnings, the bookmaker made a public appeal for him to come forward.
Polling in the lead-up to the 7 May election indicated a hung parliament.
However, the Conservative Party won a slim majority in the House of Commons.
Alex Donohue, of Ladbrokes, said: "I can confirm that the gentleman has been paid in full and has specifically asked not to be identified.
"Once again, we congratulate him on his record-breaking election win."
