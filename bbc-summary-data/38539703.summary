[SN]TITLE[SN]
Notts County 0-0 Mansfield Town

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Kevin Nolan marked his first game in charge of Notts County by halting their 10-game losing league run as his side held local rivals Mansfield to a goalless draw at Meadow Lane.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Magpies had been managerless since sacking John Sheridan on 2 January, with former Leyton Orient boss Nolan, 34, taking charge as player-manager on Thursday - less than 24 hours after the club was taken over by Alan Hardy.
And while Nolan left himself out of his first squad, Notts County did enough to warrant a first point since drawing with Luton on 29 October.
In the first half, Mansfield's Ben Whiteman fashioned the only goalscoring chance when he meandered into the box and saw his shot bounce off a Magpies defender and loop into the air before being scrambled away by alert home goalkeeper Adam Collin.
Notts skipper Michael O'Connor saw a rifled shot closed down by a visiting defender after the restart, before Mansfield's Yoann Arquin inexplicably prodded wide just a few yards in front of goal to ensure the spoils were shared in front 11,328 supporters - Meadow Lane's biggest crowd of the season.
