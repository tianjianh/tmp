[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Thomas Wengierow admitted a charge under the Data Protection Act committed when he worked at the company's Baird Avenue centre.
The court heard Wengierow "knowingly or recklessly obtained or disclosed" personal data from a Tesco database.
He then copied the details into an email and sent it to himself.
Wengierow, 47, of Pitalpin Court, Dundee, pleaded guilty to a charge under the Data Protection Act.
His solicitor David Duncan said his client was not presently in the country but would return for a future sentencing hearing.
Sheriff Alastair Carmichael deferred sentence until next month for his personal appearance.
