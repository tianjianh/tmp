Prime minister: Hailemariam Desalegn
Hailemariam Desalegn was sworn in as prime minister of Ethiopia in September 2012, ending a period of uncertainty following the death of long-term leader Meles Zenawi.
A Protestant Christian from the small Welayta ethnic group in southern Ethiopia, Mr Hailemariam leads the ruling coalition Ethiopian People Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF).
As a former deputy prime minister and foreign minister, Mr Hailemariam was considered a close ally of Meles Zenawi. He has pledged to continue his "legacy without any change".
Meles Zenawi was praised by many for his success in revitalising Ethiopia's economy but criticised for his human rights record and his failure to allow full democracy.
Radio is the medium of choice, reaching rural areas where most Ethiopians live.
The state controls most broadcasting outlets, including the sole national TV network, but there is a handful of private radio stations.
The number of privately-owned newspapers has grown; it offers quite different reporting to state-owned newspapers and routinely criticises the government.
Some key dates in Ethiopia's history:

1855-1868 - Reign of Emperor Tewodros II, who lays the foundation for the modern Ethiopian state.
