The central defender took a kick to the leg during the 2-1 win against Slovakia on Saturday - Wales' first victory at a major championship finals since 1958.
He finished the game, but suffered some swelling which needed treatment.
"We've started working on it already and we've got a few days before the next game so I'll be fine," he said.
"It was a kick and luckily it was on the pad, but it's come up and swollen a bit through the pad - but it's fine."

Williams stayed down for several minutes after one Slovakian attack and was clearly limping in the later stages.
Wales are in a strong position in their qualifying group after England and Russia drew 1-1 in Marseille on Saturday night.
The top two teams from each group qualify for the knockout stages, along with the four best third-placed teams.
Williams said the win over Slovakia was "a great day for Welsh football", but that they were taking nothing for granted against England.
"As I've said before, it's another game," Williams added.
"We understand everything that comes with it, but it's another three points we'll be trying to get.
"I'm just happy that we've got a good start to the campaign. It's exactly what we needed to settle the nerves and give ourselves a chance of getting out of the group."
