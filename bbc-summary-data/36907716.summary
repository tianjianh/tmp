Brett Ferres: Leeds Rhinos forward signs contract extension

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
England forward Brett Ferres has signed a new contract with Leeds Rhinos that will keep him at the Super League club until the end of the 2019 season.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Ferres joined Rhinos from Huddersfield for an undisclosed fee in January, and has made 19 appearances this season.
The 30-year-old had been at the Giants since 2012, having previously played for Castleford, Wakefield and Bradford.
"Results and our league position [ninth in Super League] have not gone to plan, but this is a great club," he said.
"I will be looking to knuckle down and make the most of this opportunity to help get the team back to where we want to be at the top of the table."
Leeds, the defending Super League champions, will face Featherstone Rovers in the Qualifiers on 6 August after finishing ninth.
