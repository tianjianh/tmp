[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A long-awaited £14m water park has opened after its initial unveiling was delayed due to technical difficulties with water temperature.

Alpamare Scarborough had been due to open on Thursday in North Bay but was put back so a new part could be fitted.
It includes indoor and outdoor pools, waterslides and a spa, and is part of the £150m Sands development in the North Yorkshire seaside town.
Park plans were first proposed in 2005 but have faced several set-backs.
The work, halted by developers Benchmark Leisure in 2009 because of the economic downturn, got a loan of £9m from Scarborough Borough Council.
The water attraction, predicted to attract about 500,000 visitors a year, is built on a 13 hectare site of the Burniston Road car park.
In September 2013, the council decided by a single vote to provide the loan for the park.
