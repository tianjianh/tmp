Water flowed over the top of the white limestone rocks of Malham Cove on Sunday, briefly making it England's highest unbroken waterfall.
Footage of the occurrence, filmed by Stuart Gledhill, has been seen online more than 100,000 times.
Mr Gledhill, from Malham, said: "The waterfall drop was surveyed earlier this year by cave divers and was found to be 70.06m (230ft), making it briefly the highest single drop waterfall in England above ground."
