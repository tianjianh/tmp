Shirley Glover's Volvo crossed onto the wrong side of the A450 carriageway near Shenstone and hit Stuart Frost's MG3.
He was pronounced dead at the scene while his partner Emma Lunn suffered multiple injuries.
Glover, 50, from Stourport-on-Severn, admitted causing death and serious injury by dangerous driving when she appeared at Hereford Crown Court.
The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS)  said Glover failed to tell the DVLA she suffered with a sleeping condition.
She had left work early on the day of the crash, 21 March, as she was not feeling well and subsequently fell asleep at the wheel, prosecutors said.
The CPS said she suffered with Obstructive Sleep Apnoea - a condition that can affect people's ability to drive safely - and had taken three prescription medicines which had warnings concerning drowsiness and driving.
Paying tribute to her husband-to-be, Ms Lunn said: "He inspired so many people and has left a huge hole with so many people and so many areas of his life."
Mr Frost's parents called him the "perfect son" and said they had been left "totally devastated".
Prosecutor Ian Crooks said Glover, of Great Western Way, was fully aware of her Obstructive Sleep Apnoea yet she still got behind the wheel of her car when feeling tired.
"The consequences of Glover's failure to control her vehicle were devastating," he said.
"Our thoughts today are very much with the family and friends of Stuart Frost."
Glover was jailed for two years and nine months and banned from driving for five years.
