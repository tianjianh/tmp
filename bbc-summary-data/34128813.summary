William Dick, 25 was convicted at Dumfries Sheriff Court last month of killing a buzzard in April 2014.
Witnesses said they saw Dick, of Kirkmahoe, Dumfries, throw rocks at the bird and repeatedly stamp on it.
A spokesman for the Crown Office said one witness described the incident as "sickeningly violent".

Two walkers watched Dick attack the bird, after they came across him on the Newlands Estate, Kirkmahoe, according to the Crown Office.
They saw him place a bundle wrapped in his jacket into a dark grey 4x4 pick-up truck before driving away.
The witnesses contacted the Scottish SPCA, who got in touch with Police Scotland.
Investigators found a dead hare, feathers and a rock with blood on it at the scene of the killing.
The feathers were tested by Scottish government scientists who found DNA which confirmed they came from a buzzard.
Dick was convicted despite claiming he was on his way home from a training course, more than 100 miles away, at the time of the offence.
A solicitor for Dick said his client would not be able to work as a gamekeeper for a considerable period.
It is understood an appeal against conviction is being lodged.
Helen Nisbet, of the serious and organised crime division of the prosecution service, said: "Birds of prey are given strict protection by our law.
"It is highly important to preserve Scotland's natural heritage, including the wildlife that forms part of it.
"We take people breaking our wildlife laws very seriously. This conviction highlights that message."
She added: "The Crown will continue to prosecute such cases where appropriate to ensure that offenders are brought to justice."
Scottish Gamekeepers Association Chairman Alex Hogg said it had a "clear and consistent policy" and did not condone wildlife crime.
"It is our understanding that an appeal has been lodged in this particular case so it would not be appropriate for us to comment until such times as the legal process has concluded."
A spokesman for Scottish Land & Estates said it had a clear and long-established policy of condemning all forms of wildlife crime.
He added: "Those who engage in such activity should feel the full force of the law. Newlands Estate is a member of Scottish Land & Estates but that membership has been suspended voluntarily pending further inquiries and ongoing legal proceedings."
