[SN]TITLE[SN]
Warsop 'rihgt' turn road marking spelt wrongly

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Contractors were left red-faced after incorrectly painting the word "rihgt" on a road off a supermarket car park.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The spelling error was spotted close to the High Street in Warsop, Nottinghamshire on Friday afternoon.
Eric Hill quickly photographed the sign, which should have read "right", prior to the error being painted over.
A spokesman for the Co-op said the contractors were made aware of their mistake and would amend the spelling "as quickly as possible".
