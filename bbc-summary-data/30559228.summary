Jordan Lee Francois, who was freed from Wandsworth jail on Thursday, was found in Edmonton, north London at 05:35 GMT, the Metropolitan Police said.
The Ministry of Justice earlier confirmed the 18-year-old had been released "in error".
Police had offered a Â£10,000 reward for information leading to Mr Francois's arrest.
The MoJ said: "Releases in error are a very rare but regrettable occurrence.
"The number of incidents have fallen significantly in recent years with figures down by a quarter compared to 2009-10, but every incident is taken extremely seriously and we are not complacent."
