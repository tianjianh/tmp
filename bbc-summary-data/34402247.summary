Ipswich breech birth death: Coroner calls for national review

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A coroner has called for a national review of breech birth deliveries after a mother lost her baby girl following a series of failings.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Bonnie Strachan died at Ipswich Hospital on 24 January after being deprived of oxygen when she was delivered feet first.
Her parents, Emma and James Strachan, had decided against a caesarean.
An inquest heard too few professionals were experienced in vaginal breech deliveries.
In this case guidelines stated that a consultant who was an expert in such deliveries should have been present but he failed to attend.
Giving evidence, Mrs Strachan, 29, of Framlingham, said: "We do not feel we had properly been made aware of the risks of a vaginal breech delivery."
Suffolk coroner Peter Dean said he would be writing to the chief medical officer to emphasise the importance of having a consultant present for such high risk deliveries.
"I hope this will prevent similar tragic circumstances in future," he added.
Reaching a narrative conclusion, Dr Dean said: "Bonnie died from complications following a prolonged final phase of a breech delivery.
"The presence of a consultant would have led to an earlier delivery and the immediate prospects for survival would have been improved.
"Whether the ultimate outcome would have been successful simply cannot be established."
The inquest heard consultant obstetrician Andrew Leather did not attend the delivery in contravention of the hospital's own guidelines.
He said that in hindsight he should have attended instead of leaving a registrar who had previously performed only two breech deliveries to take charge.
"Retrospectively I obviously made an error of judgment and in future I will always attend regardless of the experience of who is present, but I was misled by our telephone conversation."
Registrar Bethany Revell said she spoke to Mr Leather three times on the phone and there was confusion over whether he would attend.
After emerging feet first, the family felt Bonnie was "left hanging" before midwives decided to release her arms and head.
The inquest heard that with her umbilical cord compressed, a 10-minute window of opportunity in which to deliver Bonnie before foetal reserves were exhausted was missed.
Speaking outside the inquest, Mrs Strachan said: "We hope lessons can be learned to avoid further preventable baby deaths. We would like to instigate real change."
Their solicitor Guy Forster, from Irwin Mitchell, said the couple had never been interested in a witch hunt.
"We hope this conclusion can influence policy locally but also nationally," he added.
"The coroner's decision to write to the chief medical officer is very significant and hopefully that will bring about a real change."
