Stuart Hogg will miss the rest of the British and Irish Lions tour of New Zealand because of a facial injury.

The Scot, 24, fractured a bone in a collision with team-mate Conor Murray during the win over the Crusaders.
No replacement will be called up at this stage, with Leigh Halfpenny, Jared Payne, Liam Williams and Anthony Watson among the options at full-back.
"It is hugely disappointing for Stuart to have to return home early," said head coach Warren Gatland.
"Stuart has been a key member of our squad on and off the field and it is disappointing to see injury cut short his time with us in New Zealand.
"We all wish him the best with his recovery and we look forward to seeing him back in action."
Hogg, the Six Nations player of the tournament for the past two seasons, was on his second Lions tour, having been involved in Australia in 2013.
He will now return to Scotland to continue treatment.
"I'm gutted to be leaving the Tour at this stage," Hogg said.
"It is an honour to have been involved in a second British and Irish Lions tour. I have hugely enjoyed my time with the squad and I'm very excited about the potential of this group.
"I'm disappointed to be leaving in this way but wish all the squad the best in the coming weeks and will be cheering them on from home."
The Lions play the fourth match of their tour on Tuesday against the Highlanders in Dunedin (08:35 BST), with Irishman Payne starting at full-back.
