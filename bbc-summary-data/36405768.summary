The 32-year-old came from behind to claim a gripping 9-11 11-6 5-11 12-10 11-5 victory.
The match was in the balance with a tie-break in the fourth game, but Massaro held her nerve to take it to the fifth.
World champion in 2013 and runner-up this year, Massaro was comfortable in the deciding game to take the title.
"At the beginning of the fifth game I told myself that it's one more game, and then it's the end of the season, with a big prize at the end of it, so just go for it," she said.
"It was the right approach because I was as relaxed as I have ever been for that game, and I think I hit my targets and made the right choices."
France's world champion Gregory Gaultier beat Australia's Cameron Pilley 11-4 11-5 8-11 11-6  to regain the men's title after a seven-year interval.
