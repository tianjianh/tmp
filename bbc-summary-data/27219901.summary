Scotland's population reached an all-time high of 5,327,700 in mid-2013, according to new official figures.

The figures, based on 2011 census data, showed a rise of 14,100 people compared to the previous year, said the National Records of Scotland statistics.
About 47,700 people came to Scotland from England, Wales and Northern Ireland, according to the figures.
And about 39,800 left Scotland to go in the opposite direction, resulting in a net migration gain of 7,900.
National Records of Scotland chief executive Tim Ellis, said: "Scotland's population increased by 14,100 from mid-2012 to mid-2013, primarily because of a net in-flow of approximately 10,000 more people coming to Scotland than leaving, although there were also around 900 more births than deaths.
"For the 10th consecutive year, more people arrived in Scotland from the rest of the UK and overseas than left to go in the opposite direction.
"However, for the first time in nine years, net migration from the rest of the UK was larger than that from overseas."
Mr Ellis added: "More people arrived in Scotland from the rest of UK and fewer people left to go in the opposite direction, compared with the previous year.
"In contrast, for the third consecutive year, fewer people came to Scotland from overseas than in the preceding year."
