Premier League predictions: Lawro v Biffy Clyro singer Simon Neil

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
BBC Sport's football expert Mark Lawrenson is pitting his wits against a different guest each week this season.

His opponent for the weekend's Premier League fixtures is Biffy Clyro frontman Simon Neil.
Neil told BBC Sport: "I liked to think I was quite a good footballer with a cultured left foot when I was younger but, when I started playing with some properly talented kids, I realised I wasn't as close to Diego Maradona as I had thought.
"My one party trick is that I can do keepy-uppies and sing and play any song on a guitar at the same time."

A lifelong Rangers fan, Neil paired the Glasgow club with city rivals Celtic when he and bandmate James Johnstone made the draw for the Scottish Cup fifth round in the 2010-11 season.
"The first game I went to see was Rangers v Motherwell when I was five," he added. "I remember it vividly because I wrote a big story about it at school. My dad took me to games until I was about 15 so Rangers were a big part of my childhood.
"I am still into football as much now, but the last couple of years as a Rangers fan have not been quite so enjoyable, that's for sure!"
Biffy Clyro will headline this summer's T In The Park and Isle of Wight Festivals, and have a new album out later this year.
A correct result (ie picking a win, draw or defeat) is worth ONE point. A correct score earns THREE points.
Last weekend, Lawro got seven correct results from 10 Premier League games, with no perfect scores. His tally of seven points saw him beaten by 'Bad Neighbours' actor Zac Efron, who got five correct results, including three perfect scores, for a total of 11 points.
