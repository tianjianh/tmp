Sullivan helped the club to four trophies during his first three seasons in Leicester.
The 35-year-old returns following a season with the London Lions.
Riders head coach Rob Paternostro said: "He was a part of some of the most successful moments in our club's history and we're delighted to bring him back."
Sullivan, who captained Team GB at the 2012 London Olympics, was twice named the British Basketball League's Most Valuable Player and is a four-time BBL play-off champion.
He inspired the Riders to a treble of silverware in 2012-13 and the BBL Cup the following season.
"He is as versatile a player as they come," Paternostro added.
"He has demonstrated he can play any spot on the offensive and defensive end which will be very useful for our team.
"Drew has as strong a competitive hunger as anyone I know. He is really looking forward to playing with the group that we have returning next season."
The Riders begin their pre-season programme against the Loughborough Student Riders on Sunday, 30 August.
