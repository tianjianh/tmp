Five goals were scored in the first half, with Greg Stewart and Kane Hemmings striking early for Dundee.
Ross County captain Andrew Davies headed in from a corner before Rory Loy diverted home Hemmings' shot.
Alex Schalk netted on half-time, but Craig Wighton and Stewart with a fine solo goal made the points safe late on.
After seven minutes Stewart drove through the heart of the County defence before turning the ball onto his favoured left foot and curling it into the bottom corner.
Two minutes later Hemmings took full advantage of slackness in the Staggies defence and knocked home his 23rd goal of the campaign.
It was no more than Paul Hartley's side deserved after a whirlwind start.
Jim McIntyre's team eventually woke up and reduced the deficit after a succession of corners.
Davies ghosted in at the front post and with a glancing header knocked the ball beyond David Mitchell to give the travelling fans hope of retaining their place in the top half of the table.
And they should have been back on level terms when Michael Gardyne's cross was met on the volley by Martin Woods but the midfielder hammered the ball over the crossbar.
Dundee however restored their two-goal advantage as once again the visitors defence was breached.
Hemmings had a shot on goal that was glanced into the top corner by Loy giving Gary Woods no chance in the County goal.
The first-half action though was far from over. Schalk latched onto a long through-ball and although Dens keeper Mitchell got his hand to the shot there was enough
The second half failed to live up to the opening period but there were still plenty of chances created at both ends.
Gardyne blasted high over the crossbar from 12 yards out while Ian McShane saved on the line from Dundee top scorer Hemmings as the home side looked for goal number four.
County survived a scare when Hemmings managed to get a touch on the end of a Stewart free-kick but the ball trickled only a few inches the wrong side of the post.
The home side secured all three points with four minutes left when Wighton hammered the ball home after Stewart's shot was blocked.
Stewart completed the scoring when he once again fired home with a cultured left-foot shot that beat Woods.
Hartley's side are now in pole position to secure a place in the top six for the season run-in.
