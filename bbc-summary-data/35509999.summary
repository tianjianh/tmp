Exeter could have taken the lead after five minutes but Jayden Stockley nodded Jamie McAllister's cross just wide.
Joel Grant nearly put the visitors in front against his former club but Ryan Allsop saved and Stockley fired wide.
Wycombe took all three points when McGinn curled a fine effort into the top corner from 25 yards out.
Wycombe boss Gareth Ainsworth told BBC Three Counties Radio:

"It is a home win and a home goal, which is more important.
"We deserved it. Those people here today will have seen us grow as a club and as a team, the way we played and the way we set up today against one of the best footballing teams in the division.
"Some of the work rate today was phenomenal. And to mix that with some of the good football we played we've got a nice end to the first win of 2016 at home.
"For a team that was written off at the start of last season, then not meant to recreate what we did last season, we're doing okay."
