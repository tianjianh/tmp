A former head of the British army has said he is pleased he faces no further action in connection with allegations of historical child abuse.

Lord Bramall, 92, was interviewed under caution by police on 30 April 2015.
The peer, who was not arrested and has always denied the allegations, told the BBC he had received a letter from the Metropolitan Police clearing him.
The Met confirmed on Friday it had told a man in his 90s that no further action would be taken against him.
Lord Bramall, a Normandy veteran who retired from the House of Lords in 2013, told the BBC "there wasn't one grain of truth" in the allegations, made against him by a man in his 40s.
He said the letter the Met sent him was "pretty grudging, but at least I'm in the clear".
Lord Bramall added it was "complete self-justification" by the police, who he claimed "had not behaved very well".
The Met said it had informed a man in his 90s who was interviewed on 30 April 2015 by officers working on Operation Midland that he would face no further action.
The force added: "Following a thorough investigation officers have concluded there is insufficient evidence to request the Crown Prosecution Service to consider charging the man with any offences."
Operation Midland is part of a wider umbrella of investigations by Scotland Yard, dubbed Operation Fairbank, into allegations of abuse involving senior politicians and high-profile figures.
It has focused on the Dolphin Square estate in Pimlico, south-west London.
A field marshal and baron, Lord Bramall served during the Normandy landings during World War Two and commanded UK land forces between 1976 and 1978.
He became chief of the general staff - the professional head of the Army - in 1979, and in 1982 he oversaw the Falklands campaign.
Later that year he became chief of the defence staff - the most senior officer commanding the UK's armed forces.
