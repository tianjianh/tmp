[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A petition calling for tougher sentences for drink-drivers who kill has passed the threshold to be considered for debate in the Commons.

It was launched by the family of Miriam Briddon, 21, who was killed by a drink-driver near Ciliau Aeron in Ceredigion.
Gareth Entwhistle, of Ciliau Aeron, Lampeter, admitted causing death by careless driving while under the influence of alcohol.
His five-and-a-half-year jail sentence was cut by six months on appeal.
Miss Briddon, from Cross Inn near Newquay in Ceredigion, was driving on the A482 in March 2014 when her Fiat Punto was hit by a Volkswagen Golf being driven by Entwhistle.
He was jailed in October 2015, but his term was later cut.
A little over a month since the petition was launched, it has gathered more than 105,000 signatures.
For the UK Government to consider a debate on the matter, a petition needs to reach 100,000 signatures.
Miss Briddon's mother, Ceinwen Briddon, told BBC Cymru Fyw the aim was to present the petition to MPs.
"We decided as a family that we would reach the 100,000 target before taking the next step. We now hope to contact Theresa May's office directly, send her a letter, take the petition to London."
The Home Office said it was considering sentencing relating to drink-drive offences.
