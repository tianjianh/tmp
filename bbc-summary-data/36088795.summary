The Gunners, who had lost back-to-back league games to rivals Manchester City and Chelsea, went ahead through Jordan Nobbs' fine long-range strike.
Midfielder Dominique Janssen's header doubled Arsenal's lead after the break.
Emma Follis curled in to give newly promoted Reading hope in the closing stages, but the Royals missed chances and remain winless in the top flight.
Spain's Natalia had put the ball in the net for Arsenal with the score at 1-0, but was deemed to have been offside.
Reading - who lost their opening game of the season 3-1 at Arsenal in March - rallied in the latter stages and Follis almost equalised in stoppage time but saw her volley go wide.

Birmingham Ladies earn first points of the season
Arsenal defender Casey Stoney: "If we had gone away with a draw we would've had to seriously look at ourselves.
"Three points tonight was massive for us to just get a little bit of confidence back and a bit of rhythm back - and also some points, most importantly.
"It should have been more comfortable, given the first half, but also in the second half we had a couple of one-on-ones with the goalkeeper and we haven't taken them.
"But credit to Reading, they never give up, they always fight. They're doing really well considering they're a newly promoted team. They're very difficult to play against."
Reading forward Lauren Bruton: "In the last 20 minutes we actually did really well and it's a shame that we didn't start that way.
"It was a tough game and it's just a shame that we had all the pressure in the last 20 minutes, but it wasn't meant to be.
"We were hoping to go in 0-0 at half-time and unfortunately they scored. But we were happy with 1-0 at half-time and we knew we could push them in the second half. It was just a shame that we let in that second goal but we finished so well."
