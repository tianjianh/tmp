Newport County to get Rodney Parade pitch help from Football League

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The English Football League (EFL) is helping Newport County to sort drainage issues with the Rodney Parade pitch.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The EFL sent a specialist company to the ground to inspect the surface last week and Newport are awaiting details of the report.
County's League Two encounter with Morecambe on Saturday was abandoned at half-time because of waterlogging.
Newport are awaiting a report from the company as they look to ensure two lucrative cup games can go ahead.
Newport host Plymouth in an FA Cup replay on Wednesday, 21 December, with the winners visiting Liverpool in the third round on Sunday, 8 January.
The game between the Exiles and Argyle is to be televised, with both clubs receiving £37,000 as a broadcast fee.
The winners of the second-round replay then receive £144,000 in television money for the visit to Anfield, plus a portion of the gate receipt funds.
However, if the second-round replay is washed out, it is unlikely the replay will be staged in time to allow the third-round clash to take place on the correct date, meaning the clubs would lose the TV revenue.
With Newport and the EFL keen to avoid such issues, it is understood specialists commissioned by the EFL were at the ground last week.
County are keen to find answers for they have now had two games - against Morecambe and Barnet -  abandoned at half-time this season. The League two encounter with Stevenage was also postponed on 1 October.
Three teams use Rodney Parade - County and two rugby sides, Newport Gwent Dragons and Newport RFC.
The Exiles are tenants at the ground, which is owned by Rodney Parade Limited.
Newport County signed a 10-year lease to use Rodney Parade in 2013.
The Exiles have had problems with the pitch since 2013. Last season their then-manager John Sheridan criticised the club when an FA Cup third round clash with Blackburn fell foul to the weather.
