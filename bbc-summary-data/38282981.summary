The Ulster champions made a nervy, error-strewn start but settled down to dominate with Christopher Bradley and Meehaul McGrath netting.
Slaughtneil led 2-5 to 0-1 at the break and eased to a win while St Kiernan's had James Moran red-carded.
The Derry men will face Leinster team St Vincent's in next year's semi-final.
Slaughtneil were firm favourites for the quarter-final encounter but Michael O'Donoghue gave the hosts an early lead.
That was their first and last point of the half as Slaughtneil worked their way into the game to take control.
Slaughtneil fired over three points before Christopher Bradley hit the net after good work from Padraig Cassidy.
It was quickly followed by the second goal, with McGrath flicking in past keeper Brendan Mulrooney.
The game was over as a contest by half-time and the tempo dropped after the interval.
St Kiernan's forward Adrian Moyles scored three second-half points but the Londoners were totally outclassed.
They lost Dara Quinn to a black card before Moran was dismmised for two yellows.
Shane McGuigan scored four points for the victors with Paul Bradley firing over three while Christopher Bradley added two points to his goal.

"We are well pleased with that result and it's great to be in the semi-finals," said Slaughtneil assistant manager John Joe Kearney.
"St Kiernan's gave us a battle in the first 10 minutes but once we settled down we got the goals to give us a cushion.
"However, St Kiernan's never gave up and kept going even when they had a man sent-off."
