Swansea and Aston Villa could be punished for a fracas in the tunnel following Saturday's match at Villa Park.

The tunnel was seen to be shaking as stewards rushed in to calm tensions after the Swans secured a 2-1 win.
The Football Association will study referee Neil Swarbrick's report before deciding whether to take action.
"It's typical when both teams are struggling - players were frustrated," said Swansea's Gylfi Sigurdsson.
"But I think it shows the passion and how much they want to win. They're going to get situations where you're angry and those things happen, we've seen it plenty of times before.
"The players have sorted it out, nothing major happened."
Swansea's Federico Fernandez and Villa's Micah Richards were involved in a confrontation in the first half and had to be separated by team-mates.
It was Villa's sixth straight league defeat and was followed by the sacking of manager Tim Sherwood on Sunday.
