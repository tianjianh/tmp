Premier League predictions: Lawro v former NFL star Osi Umenyiora

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
BBC Sport's football expert Mark Lawrenson is pitting his wits against a different guest each week this season.

Lawro's opponent for this weekend's Premier League fixtures is former NFL star Osi Umenyiora, who will be making his predictions on Friday.
Umenyiora, born in London, played football as a child before switching to gridiron when he moved to the United States as a teenager.

Our scoring system has changed this season and a correct result (picking a win, draw or defeat) is now worth 10 points. The exact score earns 40 points.
Last weekend, Lawro got seven correct results from 10 Premier League games, including one perfect score.
His score of 100 points saw him beat Stereophonics frontman Kelly Jones, who picked one correct result with no perfect scores, for a total of 10.
We are keeping a record of the totals for Lawro and his guests (below), and showing a table of how the Premier League would look if all of Lawro's predictions were correct (at the bottom of the page).
