The swans suffered fatal injuries when they were shot with what is believed to be an airgun at Haverfordwest's Withybush Woods.
An unharmed cygnet was also recovered and put in the care of the RSPCA.
Insp Tim Davies, of Dyfed-Powys Police, said: "This was a distressing incident, and we are aware of the impact in the local community."
He added: "We are thoroughly investigating this serious wildlife crime."
He also appealed for anyone with information about the shootings, which were reported to the police on Saturday, to contact the force.
The RSPCA said it was "very shocked and saddened" to hear about the deaths.
The swan is a protected species in the UK and it is a criminal offence to harm one.
