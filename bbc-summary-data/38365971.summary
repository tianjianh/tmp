Calf of Man: 'Independent souls' sought for Britain's most isolated jobs

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Applications for two of the most remote jobs in the British Isles are being sought by Manx National Heritage (MNH).

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The two successful candidates will be the entire population of the presently uninhabited Calf of Man - a tiny island off the Isle of Man - for nine months.
In severe weather the island can be cut off from the Isle of Man for weeks with supplies delivered by boat once a week.
Ian Lycett, who did the job last year, said the ornithology and estate warden positions suited "independent souls".
Each warden will receive basic accommodation in a small farmhouse, where they are only allowed one shower a week.
They will have to fetch their own water and use a generator to provide electricity.
Mr Lycett spent nine months on the island last year and was visited by the BBC who made a 360 film about his life on the Calf.
The wildlife lover, from Wolverhampton, held the position of estate warden where his role included running a small hostel and undertaking numerous practical tasks like dry stone walling and heather management.
Other tasks included shepherding, bird ringing and monitoring seal, rat, and moth populations.
The ornithology warden is responsible for the monitoring and ringing of the resident and migrant bird populations.
About 40 species breed on the island, which is approximately one square mile in size and has been a bird observatory since 1959.
Among the projects ongoing on the island is the Manx shearwater project - a plan to eradicate rats and attract back ground-nesting birds including puffins.
A MNH spokeswoman said: "This is a unique opportunity to both work and live in one of Britain's most remote and beautiful locations."
Applicants have until the 6 January to submit their interest.
