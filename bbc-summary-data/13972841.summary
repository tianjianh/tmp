A man who raped a teenager in Aberdeen has been jailed for eight years.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Adrian Ruddock, 38, was found guilty at the High Court in Aberdeen earlier this year. He had claimed sex had been consensual.
The victim, who cannot be named, said in evidence she had attempted suicide twice after the attack, which happened in a flat in December last year.
Lord Bracadale, at the High Court in Glasgow, said: "She has been profoundly affected by the experience."
The judge also ordered that Ruddock should be kept under supervision for a further three years.
The woman, now aged 20, said she was "happy" with the sentence.
Ruddock was put on the sex offenders register indefinitely.
