Man who spoke of desire to abuse baby is jailed

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Robert McNab was sentenced to almost three years in jail for downloading indecent images of children, sharing them and sending offensive messages.
The 30-year-old admitted carrying out the offences between 2007 and 2016 at his flat in Greenock.
He was also given a two-year licence, which means he will be monitored after being released from prison.
Greenock Sheriff Court heard how McNab, who has previous convictions for hoarding indecent images of children and sexually assaulting a young girl, chatted to people on Facebook and WhatsApp using a fake name.
He talked about sexually abusing children and raping a baby.
The sex offender, who is also known as Robert Aitman, was found to have a stash of indecent pictures and videos - including footage of babies and children up to the age of 14 being sexually abused.
Defence solicitor Gerry Keenan said McNab was the victim of repeated sexual abuse when he was a child.
"Clearly there are issues which would require to be addressed in the public interest to minimise and reduce the risk of further offending," he said.
He asked for McNab to be spared jail and said he would engage with a treatment programme for sex offenders.
However, Sheriff Derek Hamilton ruled that a custodial sentence was required for such a "disturbing" case and jailed him for 35 months
He was also placed on the Sex Offenders Register for life.
