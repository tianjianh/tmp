Head teacher offers to put right 'wrong uniforms'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A head teacher has offered to pay to replace "wrong uniforms" - after dozens of children ended up in isolation.

Dame Maureen Brennan said parents were warned about short skirts, tight trousers and trainers in a letter sent from Barr Beacon School last term.
"We will buy shoes and trousers for those parents that cannot afford to replace the 'wrong ones'," she said.
Students not complying stayed in the hall at the school in Aldridge, West Midlands, while parents were contacted.
It follows problems at a school in Kent where police had to intervene in a disturbance as rows over uniforms intensified.
Dame Maureen said "skirts started to creep up, trousers started to fall down" last term, adding that staff "asked for black belts to be worn to keep up boys' trousers avoiding the need to see underwear."
The letter to parents said trainers advertised as school shoes were not acceptable footwear, she said.
"We also reminded parents that skirts should be knee length and not belts, figure hugging, tight or short, that trousers should not be leggings, jeggings or roll-on tight trousers, that false and gel nails were not permitted, that no extreme hairstyles were permitted and that correct black, leather school shoes must be worn and trainers, canvas pumps and work boots were unacceptable."
After speaking to parents on Tuesday, most children returned the next day in correct uniform and "looked a delight", said Dame Maureen.
"We are realistic and we do know parents buy items from shops in good faith and cannot always afford to replace incorrect purchases," she said.
