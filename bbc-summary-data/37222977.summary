[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Manchester United midfielder Bastian Schweinsteiger says he has no problem with manager Jose Mourinho, even though the German has little chance of playing for the club again.

Mourinho has left Schweinsteiger, 32, out of United's first-team squad and will pick young players if injuries cut his central midfield options.
Schweinsteiger does not intend to leave Old Trafford this month and said: "My wish would be to continue playing for Manchester United but I have no personal problems with Jose Mourinho."

The former Bayern Munich midfielder's contract runs to 2018 and he does not wish to play for another club in Europe and has ruled out an immediate move to Major League Soccer.
He said: "The MLS transfer window is closed. So it won't happen this season."
Schweinsteiger does intend to carrying on playing though, beyond Wednesday night's international between Germany and Finland.
He said: "I'm not going to stop playing football. I still believe in my own ability."
Wednesday's friendly game in Monchengladbach will be his 121st and last appearance for Germany after he announced his retirement last month.
Less than half of the 43,000 tickets available have been sold.
"It's a bit of a pity for Bastian, if the stadium isn't sold out," admitted Germany coach Joachim Low.
