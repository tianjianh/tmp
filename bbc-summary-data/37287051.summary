Salford Red Devils have appointed retired referee Richard Silverwood to improve team discipline and plan to recruit their own salary-cap manager.

Salford were docked six points in April for salary-cap rule breaches, costing them a top-eight place in Super League.
Silverwood, 40, officiated in the Super League for 15 years and took charge of the 2013 Rugby League World Cup final.
"Richard will be working with the players to try and improve their discipline," said owner Marwan Koukash.
"We have been conceding far too many penalties recently. The penalty count at Leeds last week was 14-6 and you can't win games from that position.
"He will be reviewing every game and helping the players understand where they went wrong. He started this week and will be with us for the long term."
Meanwhile, Salford have released Feleti Mateo from the remainder of his contract so that he can return to Australia for family reasons.
