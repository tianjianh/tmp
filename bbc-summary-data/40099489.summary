Using the form below please tell us what the most important issue is to you. Maybe you want more police or hospital staff employed, more reassurance about life post-Brexit, or less tax to pay and less confusion over immigration.
Send a message to those in power by highlighting your concerns and your questions about your future.
If you would like to be considered for a place in the studio audience, please make sure you include your contact details and whether or not you have already decided who you are voting for.

Young adults across Hampshire, Dorset, Oxfordshire, Berkshire and the Isle of Wight, either via social media or in the studio audience.
