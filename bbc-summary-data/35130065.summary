[SN]TITLE[SN]
World Rugby: New Zealand to experiment with two referees

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
World Rugby is to trial the use of two on-field referees in New Zealand's 2016 provincial championship.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The decision follows a review of the rules by rugby's governing body.
Each referee's responsibilities have not been specified but it is thought the second official will police a new offside line a metre back from rucks.
Two referees have never been used in rugby union before but Australia's National Rugby League has had two on-field officials since 2009.
