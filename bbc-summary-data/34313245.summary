County Championship: Surrey made to wait as rain stops play

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Surrey's quest to clinch the Division Two title remains in tact despite rain washing out day one of their match against Northants at The Oval.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Persistent rain in the capital saw play abandoned at 15:30 BST.
However, Surrey's title challengers Lancashire also saw the opening day against Essex abandoned at Chelmsford.
Surrey, who have already won promotion along with the Red Rose county, need 17 points to guarantee going up as champions.
Victory for Northants could see them finish third if Essex fail to win nine points.
