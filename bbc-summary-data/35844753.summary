World Twenty20 2016: 'England played with freedom to win'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
England captain Eoin Morgan says playing with freedom was the key to their stunning World Twenty20 victory over South Africa in Mumbai.

Morgan's side pulled off the second-highest run chase in Twenty20 international history in reply to what appeared an unassailable 229-6.
Chasing 230, Joe Root scored 83 from 43 balls after opener Jason Roy had set the tone, blitzing 43 from 16.
"I felt we had to play out of our skins and we did just that," Morgan said.
"There is a lot of talent in our group and the best way for us to play is how we did tonight. The freedom that we play with is the best solution for us."
Hashim Amla, Quinton de Kock and JP Duminy all made half-centuries on the way to posting what was, at the time, the second-highest score at a World T20.
But England usurped it with the highest successful run chase in the tournament's history to secure an important victory following the crushing defeat by West Indies in their opening game.
"There were positives from the West Indies game and I thought we did a lot of the same things right again tonight. We will take a lot of confidence from this," Morgan added.
South Africa captain Faf du Plessis recognised his side had been beaten by a quality performance but criticised his own team's work in the field, with England's total including 26 extras.
"We've all played this game long enough to know that no score is safe and that was the message to our bowlers," said Du Plessis.
"England batted very aggressively in the first six to put us under real pressure. They played exceptionally well but there were way too many extras from our point of view."
