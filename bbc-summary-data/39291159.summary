[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A Met officer has been charged with four offences including possession of a bladed article, over an alleged attack on a car during a stop-and-search.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The police watchdog confirmed that PC Joshua Savage had been charged in relation to the stop and search of a Ford Fiesta in Camden on 16 September.
Footage of the stop in Vicars Road was circulated on social media at the time.
PC Savage is also charged with criminal damage, common assault and threatening behaviour.
He and a colleague had been conducting a stop-and-search of a car that was filmed by the driver.
The driver, who was stopped in a case of mistaken identity, was not arrested.
A member of the public complained about the officer's conduct and the police watchdog, the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC), began an investigation, while the two officers involved were placed on restricted duties.
The IPCC investigation concluded in February and it referred its findings to the Crown Prosecution Service which authorised PC Savage to be charged.
