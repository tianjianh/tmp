The Scot, 24, won silver medals in the 500m and 1,000m in Moscow, Russia.
She finished 0.273 seconds behind Fan Kexin of China in the 500m and missed the 1,000m gold by 0.052 secs, with South Korea's Choi Minjeong winning.
Christie's participation in Moscow had been in doubt after her paternal grandmother died earlier this month.
GB Short Track performance director Stuart Horsepool said: "I'm really proud of Elise."
Christie won the European title earlier this year and stormed to victory at the World Cup in Turkey last month.
She said: "Under the circumstances, I'm really pleased with silver, but I believe I could have got more out of it if my head was in a different place."
Christie was controversially denied medals in each of her three events at last year's Sochi Winter Olympics.
She became the first British woman to win an individual short track speed skating world medal by finishing third at the 2013 Championships in Hungary.
Briton Wilf O'Reilly won a gold and silver at the 1990 and 1991 World Championships.
