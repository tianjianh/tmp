The X Factor: Will Cheryl Fernandez-Versini be back for 2015?

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
After four years away, much was made of Cheryl coming back to The X Factor to offer her Geordie inspired pearls of wisdom.

So - yes - even before this series finishes, we've been looking at how likely it is she'll return for 2015.
"We never plan. I only ever do a year [at a time]," Cheryl told Newsbeat. "We never plan three or four contractually.
"We certainly never have a conversation two days before the final." No commitment to the 12th series then.
The cynics may argue that an appearance on The X Factor has done no harm for promotion of Cheryl's album.
There would be no need to come back next year if there's no album out.
Others may say that she's actually been overshadowed in the personality stakes by Mel B, who was recently named ultimate TV personality at an awards show.
But according to host Dermot O'Leary, Cheryl is still a major draw and says he thinks she's an asset to the show.
"Cheryl has a stardust about her," he said. "It's almost like she's always in soft filter, she's got a star lens around her.
"When those kids step into the audition room she's always the first pair of eyes they clock on. You can't bottle that. She's brilliant."
There's only ever been one celebrity who's been a judge for one year and that was when Kelly Rowland made an appearance in 2011.
After being on the first four series of the show, Sharon Osborne came back for one series in 2013 before disappearing off again.
Gary Barlow made it three years on the panel before he vacated the chair as head judge to go back to Take That and allow Simon Cowell to sit back on the throne.
While you could argue that Simon and Cheryl returning may have been to bring back some judging stability to the show, that's unlikely to have been the motive.
"It's always harder for artists as they've got other careers," said Dermot.
"Gary found it a tough gig when you're a judge and an artist as it's a tricky diary to manage."
The speculation over the judges' line-up is music to the ears of The X Factor's publicity machine.
Earlier this year Simon Cowell hinted that The X Factor USA may not be over, despite being axed by Fox.
If that was the case, surely he'd relish the chance to be back on primetime American television?
"I don't want Simon to go away again," said Dermot. "Last time it was really stressful. We had to find loads of other people. It worked really but finding them was really stressful."
So if Cheryl DOESN'T come back, would the door be opened for Tulisa to make a return? Dermot thinks there is potential.
"I definitely think there's unfinished business for Tulisa and I know she would want to come back with bells and whistles."
Simon Cowell previously said he'd be up for working with her again and Louis Walsh has always been a fan.
"It's up to Simon and ITV but she was a good judge and she's had a tough year. I'd like to see her have a good year."
Whatever happens, you can be sure on one thing... Louis Walsh sitting at the end of the panel. He's practically chained to that desk.
