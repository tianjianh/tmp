[SN]TITLE[SN]
Morecambe 2-1 Cheltenham Town

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Two goals from the returning Garry Thompson gave Morecambe a dramatic opening day win over Cheltenham.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 36-year-old, who rejoined the club in the summer after nine years away, made a telling debut with a 90th-minute winner to get the Shrimps off and running for the new season.
Jim Bentley's side had to come from behind after debutant Mohamed Eisa gave the Robins the lead two minutes from the break in controversial circumstances.
Kyle Storer swung a free-kick in from from the left and after Danny Wright headed across goal, the summer signing was on hand to poke the loose ball home from close range - with the Shrimps furious that a push by Wright had not been seen by referee Antony Coggins.
The visitors went close to scoring a second six minutes after the restart when Jordan Grimes saw a close-range volley hit the post after an Alex Kenyon clearance fell perfectly for him.
Three minutes later the Shrimps levelled through Thompson, who slid in at the far post to steer home an excellent low cross from Aaron Wildig after a swift Morecambe counter-attack.
Thompson then provided the telling moment of a tight game at the death when he volleyed home from Vadaine Oliver's header across goal to take the points.
