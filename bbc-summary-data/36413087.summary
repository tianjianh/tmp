[SN]TITLE[SN]
Prince Philip to miss Jutland events on doctor's advice

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Duke of Edinburgh will miss events to mark 100 years since the Battle of Jutland on "doctor's advice", Buckingham Palace has said.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Prince Philip "reluctantly decided" not to attend the commemorations in Orkney on Tuesday, the palace added.
The 94-year-old prince has not attended hospital and it is understood he has no plans to cancel other engagements.
The Princess Royal, who was already due to attend, will represent the Royal Family at the Orkney events.
The duke, along with Princess Anne, had been due to attend a service at St Magnus Cathedral in Kirkwall and a commemorative event at Lyness Royal Naval Cemetery on Hoy.
The Battle of Jutland - the biggest naval engagement of World War One - began on 31 May 1916 when the Royal Navy's Grand Fleet, based at Scapa Flow, Orkney, clashed with the German High Seas Fleet.
In a message on the St Magnus order of service, the duke wrote that the commemorations were focused on the "endurance and gallantry" of all those who took part.
About 250 ships were involved and more than 8,000 men died.
Prince Albert - later King George VI and the duke's father-in-law - fought at Jutland aboard HMS Collingwood and was mentioned in dispatches.
