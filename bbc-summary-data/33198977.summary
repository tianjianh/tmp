What are the challenges facing Scotland's farming businesses?

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
From buffalo farmers to seaweed harvesters and organic producers, Scotland has no shortage of variety when it comes to farming and agriculture businesses. With the Royal Highland Show under way in Edinburgh, the Business Scotland programme has been marking the event by speaking to some of those producers about what is challenging in their business and what is going well for them.

Silhouetted dark against a bright blue sky, up close and personal, these buffalo are impressive beasts. They are maybe not a usual sight in Scotland, but their novelty was part of what drew Steve Mitchell to start farming them 10 years ago.
"Obviously the main thing is that they're different, they're interesting" says Mr Mitchell.
"A lot of people describe it to me as how beef used to taste. I'd like to dispute that a little bit because we try to make a very good job of producing beef from cattle as well."
In addition to almost 400 buffalo he has beef cattle, sheep, a butchery, butcher shops and does events catering.
The catering side of the business came about almost by accident. When he first started with the buffalo he had about 100 animals and that meant selling the meat in its raw form was not as profitable as it needed to be.
"I wasn't getting enough of a return to justify or give myself a wage of any kind," Mr Mitchell says.
"I needed to value-add, so that's how we started cooking our burgers at Edinburgh farmers' market and just by chance we got asked to be involved at T in the Park, which was a massive learning curve for us."
He finds the main difference between his buffalo and other animals is that there is not the breadth of knowledge about them here and few people to pass on hints and tips about their management. They grow slower but they live longer and breed for longer too.
Mr Mitchell admits that at times it has been "a very challenging business to establish" but perhaps in the not too distant future he hopes he may be in a position to start looking at making that other iconic buffalo-related product - mozzarella.
Sunbathing pigs wallowing in mud, very free-range hens and soft fruit all form part of the offering at Whitmuir organic farm near West Linton in Peeblesshire. The farm also has beef cattle, pigs, lambs, turkeys for Christmas, salad leaves, vegetables, a farm shop, cafe and a home delivery service.
The farm is run by husband and wife team, Heather Anderson and Pete Ritchie who moved here in 2000. So why is there quite so much going on?
"If you're going to supply food direct to people you have to get better at getting food to people," says Ms Anderson.
"So we opened the cafe to encourage people to come to the farm shop, we opened the home delivery service because that's how people are used to shopping increasingly and we run the food truck because it's a way of spreading our overheads and getting our food out to places like the Highland Show."
On the day that I visited, a group of excited school children was jostling a little bit to get a chance to bottle feed a lamb.
They were some of the 13,000 people who have been on the farm on some kind of educational engagement over the past five years, part of a passion to try to connect people more to food and farming.
With a background in social inclusion work and community engagement, Ms Anderson explains that they grew the business by echoing a Japanese scheme where members of the public team up with farms and ask them to grow their food and "we thought that's a no-brainer. Why don't we do that in Scotland?"
They started a farm supporters scheme which has still got about 200 people involved. They pay a monthly amount in exchange for food.
The past five years or so have not been easy for the organic sector though. In 2010 there was, according to Ms Anderson, a 22% collapse in the organic market in Scotland and a number of producers went out of business.
"It has been a long and tough period since then, five years of flatlining," she says.
"We used to always have projections where we anticipated growth, then we went to having projections where we said it won't get worse and now what you're trying to do, quite often, is manage a drop."
They have had to cut back on staff, nobody has had a pay increase and they are not able to pay the wages they would like to.
In their view what would make a real difference is help and infrastructure to allow farmers to get their food direct the public.
Ms Anderson says: "If you want to get food to Glasgow you have to physically drive it to Glasgow, you have to set up the connection, you have to negotiate the deal."
If there is one thing that Scotland is not short of, it is water and all around the 11,000 km coastline is seaweed. It used to be more widely eaten and at the moment it seems to becoming more fashionable again.
"I spent a lot of time literally just in the water looking at all the beautiful colours and flavours," says Fiona Houston, co-founder of Mara Seaweed.
The company was founded in 2010 with the aim of going after the same kinds of markets in which whisky and Scottish seafood do well.
They harvest, dry and mill seaweed into flakes which can be used as an alternative food seasoning.
Since they set up they have had to raise money, develop the product and packaging.
Last month they launched in Marks and Spencer nationwide and that has been a step change "still keeping the artisan nature of the product but making it scalable," says Ms Houston.
They hope to be entering Asian markets and elsewhere by the end of the year.
Although seaweed might seem like the ultimate wild food, in fact there is some farming too.
"It's location and accessibility," says Ms Houston.
"At the moment we've got Crown Estate licences and we're wild harvesting and we're dependent on the tides so if we're looking at scaling the business, just like any agricultural product it started off as a wild product and then it became farmed as you want to scale up the business."
They are currently growing seaweed on ropes in collaboration with other seafood producers and they also have an innovation project of a tank farm on land by the side of Loch Fyne.
"It's like going from ranching buffalo to putting them in a field, says Ms Houston.
