The first date of the HS2 compensation roadshow in the Midlands was held in Burton Green, Warwickshire.
Those directly affected by the line were able to talk to officials from HS2 Ltd and the Department for Transport about potential payouts.
There will be 22 events across the route over the next three months.
People whose homes will be affected were able to look at route maps, factsheets and consultation documents about the planned route.
The proposed London to Birmingham link runs close to the town of Kenilworth and Burton Green village.
The roadshow will also visit Southam, Kenilworth, Offchurch in Warwickshire and sites in Birmingham, Solihull and Staffordshire on later dates.
