[SN]TITLE[SN]
New Year Honours: Three Guernsey residents recognised

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A jurat appointed an OBE in the New Year's Honours has said the award was for all jurats who gave up their time.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Lieutenant Bailiff, Jurat Stephen Edward Francis Le Poidevin, has become an OBE for public service to the law and community in Guernsey.
William George de Lacey Luff was appointed an MBE for services to the cattle industry.
Roy Sarre was awarded the British Empire Medal for services to the church and music.
Jurat Le Poidevin has served as a jurat since 1995 and was in the Guernsey police force before that. He said he was "completely surprised" by the honour.
He said: "It is a great honour, but I also see it as looking at the jurat benches as a whole, I don't see it only as my award but also as an award for my colleagues I serve with."
Mr Sarre founded the award-winning Guernsey Festival Chorus in 1985 and acts as its musical director.
The choir was established to spread the gospel but has also helped raise about Â£40,000 for charity since it was founded.
Mr Luff is the secretary of the World Guernsey Cattle Federation, acting as the guardian of the breed.
