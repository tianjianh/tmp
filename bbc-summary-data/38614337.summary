[SN]TITLE[SN]
No retrial for Durham University rape accused student

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A university student accused of rape will not face a retrial after a jury failed to reach a verdict.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Durham University geography student Alastair Cooke stood trial in December accused of three counts of raping a woman after a party in June 2015.
The 22-year-old denied the charges and after a two-week trial the jury failed to reach verdicts.
The Crown Prosecution Service said there would not be a retrial after consulting the woman.
Mr Cooke, of Perranarworthal, Cornwall, originally stood trial at Durham Crown Court.
