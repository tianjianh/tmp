They had been considering a "Plan B" to retain doctor-led services at Glan Clwyd, in Bodelwyddan, Denbighshire.
But staff have been told the original plans to suspend consultant care will go ahead, according to information seen by BBC Wales.
Betsi Cadwaladr health board said it would issue a full statement on Monday.
The changes, expected to be brought in this month, would see some women having to travel more than 30 miles to Gwynedd or Wrexham for consultant care, with clinical staff transferred to Ysbyty Gwynedd in Bangor and Wrexham Maelor hospitals.
A revised plan was drawn up by health experts and politicians after a public outcry, including a demonstration of about 1,500 people in Rhyl in February.
In March, a public meeting was held with health board officials who agreed to look again at finding another way forward and which led to the "Plan B" proposals being tabled.
