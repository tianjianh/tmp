[SN]TITLE[SN]
Grimsby Town 0-0 Blackpool

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Grimsby Town and Blackpool did little for their respective League Two play-off hopes as they played out a goalless draw at Blundell Park.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Both sides have taken four points over the festive period after a contest in which chances were few and far between.
Ahead of kick-off, there were two changes in the Grimsby ranks as Zak Mills and Dominic Vose both returned, while Mark Cullen retained his place for Blackpool.
After 20 minutes Manchester United loanee Dean Henderson came to the home side's rescue as the goalkeeper pulled off a fine save to deny Kyle Vassell after an incisive Blackpool break.
At the other end, a curling free-kick from Danny Andrew went just wide, before Omar Bogle saw his tame attempt saved by Sam Slocombe.
After the interval, another fantastic save from Henderson - again from Vassell - kept it level, though he should have been beaten on 58 minutes.
Blackpool forward Mark Cullen could only glance wide when presented with a guilt-edged chance inside the six-yard box.
