The railway carries passengers the five miles (8km) between Laxey and Snaefell's summit - at 2,034 ft, the island's highest peak.
Celebrations include the unveiling of a specially commissioned piece of music, guided talks and tours of trams.
A spokesman said special services will be in operation all day.
He said: "The Manx hills will be alive with the sound of music with the first airing of a specially commissioned chamber ensemble.
"There will also be nature walks and the chance to learn all about the history of the service and the nature of the area."
Tram historian and author Andrew Scarffe will be giving onboard commentary on trams departing and returning from the summit.
The service, which was constructed and opened on 20 August 1895, connects with the Manx Electric Railway (MER) in Laxey.
