Didcot Power Station collapse: New contractor in place 'by end of month'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A new contractor should be in place to clear debris at Didcot Power Station by the end of the month, the site's owner has said.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A boiler house was set for demolition by Coleman & Company when it collapsed at the site in February.
Ken Cresswell, 57, John Shaw, 61, Michael Collings, 53, and Christopher Huxtable, 34, died in the collapse.
RWE NPower said a procurement process has been under way since the demolition company's contract ended in October.
Debris from the part of the building brought down in a controlled explosion in July still remains.
However, all clearance work on the spot where the boiler house collapsed has been completed.
RWE NPower closed the coal-fired facility at the site in March 2013 after 43 years of service, and a programme of demolition work followed.
A major incident was declared on 23 February after the boiler house collapsed. The last of the bodies was not discovered until September.
The cause of the collapse is being investigated jointly by police and the Health and Safety Executive.
Coleman & Company had been working at the site for two years before the collapse, but lost its contract in October, which it agreed was in the "best interests of all parties".
