The Legend of Barney Thomson, directed by Robert Carlyle, who also stars in the film, won two awards - including best film.
And Glaswegian Bill Paterson won a special award for outstanding contribution to film and television.
The 70-year-old has appeared in dozens of hit films and TV shows including The Killing Fields and Auf Wiedersehen Pet.
Paterson, who stars in the soon-to-be-released Dad's Army remake, said he was "thrilled" to receive the award.
Speaking on the red carpet, he said: "It's great but the added burden is that you can't pretend you don't have something ready to say, so it's swings and roundabouts.
"But I'm absolutely thrilled, it's beyond a fantastic honour because it's from the people I've worked among for decades."
When asked for his highlights in Scottish TV and film this year, Paterson joked that he was eyeing up a role in BBC Scotland police comedy Scot Squad.
"I love Scot Squad, I think it's just fantastic," he said.
"I don't often burst out laughing watching contemporary comedy in the way that I used to but this makes me do it. It's great and if there's a part in Scot Squad then I'm ready."
Former Taggart and Pirates Of The Caribbean actor Alex Norton said: "I think it's the most wonderful thing and richly deserved. I'm obviously consumed by jealousy but I can't think of anyone who deserves it more."
The Legend Of Barney Thomson won the feature film award and best actress in a film for Emma Thompson.
Sharon Rooney won the best TV actress award for My Mad Fat Diary, while Ken Stott took the equivalent male award for his performance in The Missing. David Elliot was named best actor in a film for Kajaki.
Jude MacLaverty, director of Bafta Scotland, said: "It has been a wonderful evening and this year's winners highlight the diversity of international and national projects choosing Scotland as a filming destination and the rich seam of Scottish talent working throughout the UK.
"We offer our warmest congratulations to all our worthy winners."
