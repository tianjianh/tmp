Lee, 25, is three shots ahead of Ariya Jutanugarn of Thailand.
England's Charley Hull, playing on her home course, is tied 11th on three under par while Scotland's Catriona Matthew is two under.
New Zealand's world number one Lydia Ko is two over, alongside England's four-time major winner Dame Laura Davies.
Lee, whose 62 also equalled the record for the lowest round at a Women's British Open, said: "Today was great, but it is only the first round."
Lee led this month's US Women's Open by three shots after the opening round, before fading to finish in a tie for 11th.
Hull told BBC Sport: "I was happy with my round. I was a bit nervous on the first tee obviously because it's my home golf course and it's a pretty easy shot so I'd have looked pretty silly if I'd screwed it up."
