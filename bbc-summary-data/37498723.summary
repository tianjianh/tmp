The semi-professionals bossed the first half but squandered numerous chances against the Israeli visitors.
The breakthrough came on 72 minutes when substitute Ciaran Kilduff volleyed in from Daryl Horgan's cross.
Dundalk drew their opening Group D game with AZ Alkmaar and sit second, two points behind Zenit St Petersburg.
The League of Ireland minnows again showed that they can compete at this elevated level with a display of power and pace which finally overcame a sluggish Maccabi side.
It could so easily have been a night of frustration for Dundalk as they failed to convert a series of first-half openings.
Patrick McEleney burst clear after just two minutes but sent his weak shot straight at keeper Pedrag Rajkovic.
Rajkovic saved Ronan Finn's low strike with his legs before Dundalk penalty appeals were turned down for a challenge on Robbie Benson.
Daryl Horgan was also guilty of shooting straight at Rajkovic, while McEleney summed up Dundalk's opening 45 minutes by scooping over when well placed.
Maccabi, who were beaten 4-3 by Zenit after leading 3-0 with 13 minutes left a fortnight ago, improved after the break but without potency in attack.
The historic goal, scored by Kilduff just eight minutes after he replaced David McMillan, sparked raucous celebrations in a sell-out 5,543 crowd in Tallaght Stadium.
Republic of Ireland boss Martin O'Neill was present to cast an eye over Dundalk winger Daryl Horgan, who has shone for the Lilywhites this season.
Maccabi targeted the 24-year-old for attention, often double marking the quick and skilful wideman who represented the Republic at youth level.
Horgan is tipped to a get a first senior international call-up and while this was not his finest display, he showed his class with a pinpoint cross for the only goal.
Dundalk will celebrate a memorable game before resuming domestic duties as they close in on a third straight Premier Division title.
Next up in the Europa League is a home encounter against group leaders Zenit on 20 October.
