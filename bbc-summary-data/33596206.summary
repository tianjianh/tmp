Construction teams at Prestatyn's Nova centre in Denbighshire have completed steel structural work and are moving into the second phase of redevelopment.
The centre has been shut for nearly a year-and-a-half after the trust running it on behalf of the council folded.
The Nova is expected to reopen its doors in the autumn after the council agreed to invest £4.4m in the centre.
Denbighshire council's cabinet member for community development, Huw Jones, said: "The redevelopment of the Nova is an important piece of the jigsaw in our vision to develop the leisure offer on the coast, as well as the creation of a brand new destination for visitors to the region."
