The 4-6 favourite powered to victory by three and a quarter lengths from 20-1 chance Massaat.
It was a convincing victory for the colt, owned by the Coolmore Stud team, with Emotionless a disappointment for the rival Godolphin stable.
Jockey Ryan Moore indicated Air Force Blue was probably the best two-year-old horse he had ever ridden.
Meanwhile, 50-1 outsider Grumeti, trained by Alan King, won the Cesarewitch Handicap in a photo finish from Oriental Fox.
Winning rider Adam Beschizza was completing a 764-1 autumn double, having won the Cambridgeshire Handicap on Third Time Lucky.
Air Force Blue is now favourite for next year's 2,000 Guineas at Newmarket, at odds ranging from 6-4 to evens.
"Probably at this stage, I'm struggling to think of any better [juvenile] I've ridden. He felt like there's more to come," said Moore.
