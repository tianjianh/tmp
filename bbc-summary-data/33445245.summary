Green energy summit held in Glasgow

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A green energy summit has been held in Glasgow to discuss the impact of plans to end onshore wind farm subsidies.

The UK government recently announced plans to scrap the Renewables Obligation scheme early.
UK Energy Secretary Amber Rudd has said ending the scheme meant energy bills would not need to rise.
But Scottish Energy Minister Fergus Ewing, who chaired the summit, has accused the Conservatives of ignoring Scottish concerns.
The event was attended by more than 200 people from businesses and organisations, according to the Scottish government.
The UK government has said that ending the subsidy scheme, which was funded by a levy on household fuel bills, was likely to mean about 2,500 planned onshore turbines would be cancelled.
Ending the subsidy was part of a manifesto commitment by the Conservative party ahead of the general election in May.
It had been due to end in April 2017 - but will now cease a year earlier.
When she announced the move last month, Ms Rudd said: "We are driving forward our commitment to end new onshore wind subsidies and give local communities the final say over any new wind farms.
"Onshore wind is an important part of our energy mix and we now have enough subsidised projects in the pipeline to meet our renewable energy commitments."
But the Scottish government has said that ending the subsidy will disproportionately affect Scotland, which leads the UK in onshore wind power.
Industry body Scottish Renewables has warned the change could put up to Â£3bn of investment in Scotland at risk, and called for UK ministers to reconsider.
Speaking after the summit, Mr Ewing said: "Delegates this morning spoke about the damage this will cause the rural economy - many of the shops and business that are vital to these communities.
"Over the next few weeks DECC (Department of Energy and Climate Change) will be seeking the views of those affected and I strongly encourage anyone with an interest to respond on this to ensure our concerns are heard.
"We will continue to make representations to both the UK government's energy department and to the Scotland Office, feeding back from what I heard at the summit and the many meetings I have had with representatives from the industry."
