An idea for a Lego set of a Caledonian MacBrayne ferry has been highlighted by employees at the Danish toymaker.

The model of the MV Loch Shira is a "Staff Pick" on the Lego Ideas website where designers seek support for their suggestions for new sets.
So far the ferry has gained more than 780 supporters. It needs 10,000 to qualify for a review by Lego.
Designed, built and nominated by Lego Ideas site user Lukeebee1, the Loch Shira bid has CalMac's blessing.
Lukeebee1's suggestion, titled The Great British Holiday - Off to the Scottish Isles, is one of four of the latest Staff Picks being promoted on the ideas website.
The others are a bakery, California holiday set and string instruments.
In his blurb backing his bid, Lukeebee1 said: "CalMac/Caledonian Macbrayne ferries are a common sight all along the coast of Scotland.
"Providing access to the many isles/islands that surround the Scottish mainland. Almost everyone who has visited the Scottish isles will have been on one.
"This model is based on the smaller of the ferries, in particular a ship called Loch Shira, which can often be seen at the town of Largs providing access to isles such as the Isle of Cumbrae."
The Loch Shira Lego set bid comes amid a competitive process to win a new contract to provide west coast ferry services.
Earlier this week, the Scottish government has offered CalMac Ferries Ltd and Serco Caledonian Ferries Ltd access to data to help the companies form their bids.
CalMac currently runs the Clyde and Hebrides services, which covers almost every route on the west coast.
The new contract will run from 1 October 2016 for up to eight years.
