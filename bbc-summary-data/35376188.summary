Camden Glass, part of the Camden Group, has started a 30-day consultation with staff on the closure of its factory in Benburb, according to Unite.
The firm produces and supplies PVCu window and door products.
Camden Group has told Unite it will be creating 50 new jobs at a new plant in Antrim.
Unite's representative Joanne McWilliams said Camden Group's investment in the Antrim plant was "cold comfort to the workforce in Benburb".
"Many workers in Benburb have longstanding service at the plant - one of our members has worked there for 43 years," she said.
"Many of the workers facing redundancy have built the company's success long before the current management took over.
"To compound [the] decision, management have offered the workforce only the bare minimum, statutory redundancy.
"Camden Group must live up to their social responsibilities and fully compensate their workforce for a decision driven by corporate priorities."
