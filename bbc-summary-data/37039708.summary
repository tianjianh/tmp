The 24-year-old played in recent wins over East Stirlingshire, Stranraer and Kilmarnock.
The Englishman was most recently at Grimsby Town, where he made 83 appearances in two seasons.
"It's a big chance for me, it's a massive club and I can't wait to get started," Clay told the Motherwell website.
Clay has also had spells at Chesterfield, York City, Halifax Town and Worksop Town.
He becomes the Steelmen's sixth new signing of the summer after the arrivals of Jacob Blyth, Richard Tait, Ben Heneghan, Carl McHugh and Dean Brill.
"We're delighted to get Craig signed up and I think he's been excellent over the last few weeks," said Motherwell manager Mark McGhee.
"He works hard, he's an attacking threat from midfield and is hugely popular amongst the squad.
"The way he's backed himself is first class and he's the type of player team-mates love as he'll run through brick walls for the cause. We now have some strong competition in the middle of the park, which is healthy."
