The National League side have brought in 19-year-old Erlandsson as cover for Joel Dixon, who sustained a bad knee injury late on in Tuesday night's 3-0 win at home to Guiseley.
Dixon was stretchered off, forcing outfielder Liam Hughes to take over in goal for the final few minutes.
He is now ruled out until next season with a torn anterior cruciate ligament.
Erlandsson, who has represented Sweden at Under-17, Under-19 and Under-21 level, played in this summer's Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro.
He will join up with fellow Forest youngster Ryan Yates at Holker Street, having initially signed up for a month, until his 20th birthday on Christmas Day.
Erlandsson is set to make his debut on Saturday when fourth-placed Barrow meet third-placed Dagenham & Redbridge.
Barrow, who have not lost in the National League since the opening week of the season, go into the game on a club-record 19-game unbeaten run.
