Mac's owner could hear the dog on a ledge high on the quarry wall near Pennal and called in Aberdyfi Search and Rescue Team on Thursday evening.
The team of volunteers created a rope system which allowed a rescuer to be lowered to the ledge on Friday morning.
Mac was loaded into a purpose-built bag and the pair were lowered to the quarry floor.
A spokesman for Aberdyfi SART said: "Mac was unscathed by his adventure and made his way directly to his grateful owner, pausing only for a quick detour back to his rescuer in the full knowledge that there were still biscuits in his pocket."
