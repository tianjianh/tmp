The 44-year-old former United States international striker was appointed Terriers boss in November and guided them to Championship safety last season.
His assistant Christoph Buhler has also signed a new deal.
"David is a superb operator and has used his experience of working at Borussia Dortmund to improve our club," said chairman Dean Hoyle.
"We've only just started the process of improving the club, but I sense the level of excitement amongst our fans is unparalleled since I became chairman. David - and Christoph - have played a huge role in that.
"That excitement carries to the people at the club, myself included. We're realistic in what we can achieve in the short term, but I'm so happy that David and Christoph wasted no time in showing their commitment to what we want to do here in the long term."
Wagner replaced Chris Powell after a spell as Borussia Dortmund's second team coach.
He added: "The way that the club, its people and the fans have accepted me and Christoph since the first day we arrived in Huddersfield has been unbelievable. I'd like to thank our chairman Dean Hoyle and our fantastic fans for their trust, help and support.
"I knew that this club was one that wanted to embrace new ideas, but I now understand how different our ideas have been. That has made the reaction of everyone here truly special."
