Blake Donnellan was serving part of a 15-year sentence at HMP Sudbury in Derbyshire for conspiracy to supply class A drugs.
The 31-year-old was released on temporary licence from the open prison on Christmas Day but failed to return.
He was arrested by Greater Manchester Police on Wednesday.
Donnellan was jailed in 2011 for his part in a drugs operation which saw 30 people convicted.
Drugs with an estimated street value of Â£1m and nearly Â£100,000 in cash were seized by police Devon and Cornwall Police in 2009 and 2010.
The haul included 11,000 ecstasy tablets, 14kg (31lbs) of cocaine, 330g (12oz) of heroin, 2kg (4lbs) of amphetamine and 11kg (24lbs) of BZP (Benzylpiperazine).
The Crown Prosecution Service said Donnellan was the "mover and shaker" in the network and the link between the drugs coming down from Manchester to the Plymouth area and onwards to Cornwall.
