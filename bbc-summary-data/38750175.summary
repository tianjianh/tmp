Mark Ellis: Carlisle United defender loaned to Forest Green Rovers

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Carlisle United have loaned defender Mark Ellis to Forest Green Rovers for the remainder of the season.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Plymouth-born centre-back Ellis, 28, has made just 12 appearances since joining the Cumbrians from Shrewsbury on a permanent basis last summer.
It is his second spell at the New Lawn, having spent the 2009-10 season with Rovers on loan from Torquay United.
The deal follows fellow defender Charlie Clough's move to Barnet for an undisclosed fee on Monday.
