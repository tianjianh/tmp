One child's verdict on teachers' must-reads

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
With Charlie and the Chocolate Factory heading a teachers' list of books all children should read in primary school, the BBC asked one avid young reader for his views.

Roald Dahl's cautionary tale definitely deserves its place at the top, according to 11-year-old Tom Lamb, from Shenfield in Essex, who says he reads for about an hour every day.
"It's just quite amusing and exciting to read and not boring or anything. It's a lot of different adventures, not all the same thing," Tom told the BBC.
He particularly liked the way the more obnoxious characters in the book "get paid for what they do".
"We read that with the school and we had to do comprehension over it. It was really good and quite realistic. I can imagine that sort of thing happening.
"I think I liked Tom best because he persevered with stuff and adopted William when everyone wanted him to go to a special home for children."
"I probably will read this. I know she goes into another world. I have seen the movie."
"It was quite strange but quite amusing and exciting. I like the way he wrote it with lots of detail about Matilda's family life."
"I thought it was quite scary but now I think it's quite a funny book.
"It's a very good book - quite short. So not long and boring."
"I haven't read this yet. I definitely know they go into another world and there are lots of different characters and adventures.
"I am quite keen to read it."
"It was quite easy and, when you are younger, quite a fun and enjoyable book to read with lots of good pictures to help younger children to understand what the words mean."
"When I was younger it was really scary but very good. I was very scared at first - but when I read it afterwards I thought it was really funny.  It's good the way it makes you pronounce the words again and again."
"I was about seven when I read this. I enjoyed it. It was about something that could have happened to me."
"This was fun. The pictures were really good, they helped you understand the story a bit more."
For Tom the big surprise is that the list does not include a single Harry Potter book.
"I really think they should have been on the list. I am on the last one now. I read it every night. I like the last one best, more than the other ones.
"It's called The Deathly Hallows. The other ones are more about school and stuff. This is about when he's left school and it's a lot more exciting."
