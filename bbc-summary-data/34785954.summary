A "secret" plan will see the Channel Islands' most famous aircraft put on display in the islands.

G-Joey, a yellow trislander, carried out its last flight in June after serving the islands, Southampton and Dinard for nearly 40 years.
It had been thought it would do on display in England at the end of its service.
"It's all a bit secret at the moment, Airline Aurigny reported in its Envoyage magazine.
"We hope to tell you where the trislander will be displayed early next year," it added.
The article said: "Late in the summer we were approached by a local businessman who expressed a serious interest in displaying Joey under cover, in Guernsey.
"At the time we were discussing a similar option with Southampton's Solent Sky Museum, but, after some very careful thought, we agreed to pursue the local option."
The airline said it would not comment further.
Earlier this year the airline had said there had been no official approaches for housing the aircraft in the islands and it was looking for a permanent home in England.
More than 5,600 people are part of a Save Joey Facebook group, it has a fan club and the aircraft is the star of seven books.
Paul Belben, owner of the Save Joey group, described it as "fantastic news".
"Definitely the best decision from Aurigny as regards to Joey's final retirement place.
"It will be interesting to see where this indoor space is, but I'm sure it will be a fitting place."
