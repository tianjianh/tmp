Going solo this Valentine's Day?  Don't let it get you down!  Here's our guide to staying #bodypositive.

The local restaurants might be full of loved-up couples paying premium prices, but your supermarket probably isn't - and you can get ingredients for a delicious, nutritious brunch for next to nothing.  It's surprisingly easy to poach an egg - add some grilled asparagus or ham, a toasted muffin and whip up some easy hollandaise sauce and kerpow!  Eggs Benedict.
And if you're looking for more recipes, BodyPositive and our friend Mel Wells have got you covered with our Healthy Breakfast Ideas, including delicious avocado baked eggs and banoffee pie porridge.
If you're on your own this Sunday, it's a sure bet you know someone else who is too.  With the TV listings crammed full of amazing movies, it's probably the best day of the year to have a girls' night in - and what better to watch than the Baftas?
Ideas include dressing like a character from your favourite nominated film (Minions, anyone?), eating popcorn and cupcakes and awarding each other prizes for Best Make Up and Hair - complete with heartfelt speeches, of course.
Did you know that running can boost your fertility and even ward off cancer?  It's all too easy to stay in feeling sorry for yourself on Valentine's Day - so why not get some fresh air, and some endorphins while you're at it?
You don't have to be a marathon runner to enjoy the outdoors - try the Couch to 5K app and get yourself moving. If you're not into running, check out Get Inspired's activity finder for more ideas.
