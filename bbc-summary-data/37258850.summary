Calls for realism over education reforms and Pisa tests

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
It will take time for Welsh educational reforms to be reflected in an international study of pupils' performance, Education Secretary Kirsty Williams has said.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The results of Pisa tests conducted last year are expected in December.
In results from the last Pisa tests in 2012, Wales performed worse than the rest of the UK.
Ms Williams said she was "realistic" about how quickly the results of reforms would be seen.
Pisa assesses pupils' skills in maths, reading and science every three years and more than 70 countries were signed up to take part in the 2015 test.
Results from the 2012 test - published in 2013 - showed Wales had fallen behind for a third time.
Ms Williams said it was important to redevelop Wales' education system to help children perform better and not just so pupils can pass tests.
The minister told BBC Radio Wales' Sunday Supplement programme: "The important thing is that we're not sitting back waiting for Pisa.
"We know on the back of poor Pisa results previously that we've embarked on this programme of educational reform.
"We also, I also, need to be realistic about how quickly those reforms can actually embed within a system and when you will see an effect of those in Pisa results.
"We need to reform our education system, not to teach to the test, because that is not what we're doing, but to develop a curriculum that enables our children to perform better in the kind of skills that Pisa tests."
She added: "We... have to be realistic that to improve our education system we need a long-term strategic plan.
"What will not change our system is every time we get a set of disappointing results we run off, like a rabbit, in a totally different direction."
