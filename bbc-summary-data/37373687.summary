[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A campaign group opposed to the A5 road scheme linking Londonderry and Aughnacloy has launched a second legal challenge to the project.

Work on the Newbuildings to Strabane section of the new dual carriageway was due to go ahead in 2017.
But the Alternative A5 Alliance (AA5A) has lodged an application for leave to apply for judicial review.
The Department for Infrastructure said it will oppose the latest legal challenge to the project.
In 2012, AA5A won their judicial review into the planned new route after the court ruled an environment impact assessment had not been carried out properly.
John Dunbar from AA5A said that previous experience had given the group confidence to pursue a second challenge.
He said the group continued to oppose the project on "economic and environmental grounds".
Mr Dunbar said no one could now "put a figure on how much this (the A5) will cost".
"It just does not make sense," he said.
"The dual carriageway is just not necessary."
A Public Inquiry into the A5 is scheduled to get underway in early October.
Mr Dunbar said the scope of that inquiry was "much too restrictive".
"There are a number of other issues that we wanted to object to but they haven't been included in the scope of the inquiry."
He said there was no alternative but to launch a legal challenge.
A Department for Infrastructure spokeswoman confirmed the legal application would be opposed.
"In progressing any major road improvement scheme of the scale of the A5 dualling, there is always the possibility of a legal challenge from those who may be dissatisfied with the department's proposals," she said.
The preferred route for the A5 was announced in 2009. When complete it is understood it would lessen journey times by as much as 20 minutes.
