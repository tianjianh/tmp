Isles of Scilly police job attracts global interest

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Police on the Isles of Scilly say they have had applications from around the world for a vacant post.

The job advert on Facebook went viral and applications for the role of constable have come from as far as Thailand and Australia.
The job was described as "possibly the most enviable policing post in the UK or even the world".
Sgt Colin Taylor, who posted the advert, said: "The phones were red-hot at the police station all weekend,"
Crimes between March 2014 and February 2015 in the islands, which have a population of 2,200, included 24 cases of violence, sexual offences, criminal damage and arson.
There were three cases of stolen bicycles last year, but with only five miles of roads, there is not far to go.
Sgt Taylor admitted he may have "overcooked" the job advert, and pointed out that it was only open to Devon and Cornwall Police officers and that applications closed on 3 April.
Abilities required for the post included: "The resolve to issue a parking ticket to your spouse so tactfully so as not find dinner in the dog thereafter."
Sgt Taylor said: "Commiserations go to hopefuls who contacted us from Ukraine, Texas, New York, Ohio, Oklahoma, Philippines, Thailand, Spain, Greece, loads from Italy, Australia, Germany, Portugal, South Africa and a smattering from England, Scotland and Ireland."
In one incident this year police were baffled after a fried egg was left at the scene of a break-in into a shed containing footballs.
