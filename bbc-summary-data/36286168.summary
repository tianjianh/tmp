Sigurdsson, 26, is under contract at Swansea until 2018, but has been linked with a number of big clubs.
Guidolin, appointed permanent manager on a two-year deal, hopes the Icelandic midfielder remains at the Liberty Stadium.
"I'm sure other teams have interest in Gylfi," Guidolin said.
"I hope [he stays] because he's an important player for us. But I don't know what will happen in the future."
Sigurdsson won Swansea City's supporters' and players' player of the year awards after scoring 11 goals in the club's successful fight against relegation.
He returned to Swansea from Tottenham Hotspur on a four-year deal in July 2014 having spent 2011-12 on loan at the Liberty Stadium from German club Hoffenheim.
The midfielder has been included in Iceland's squad for this summer's Euro 2016 finals in France.
Iceland have qualified for their first European Championships and will face Portugal, Austria and Hungary in Group F.
"It's a very big thing for me personally and for the rest of the country to finally reach the Euros," Sigurdsson said.
"The biggest achievement for us was to get there from a top group with Holland, Turkey and the Czech Republic.
"There probably won't be any pressure on us. Everyone is surprised we managed to get there.
"We haven't set ourselves any targets, we're in a tough group. We'll be going there to enjoy it and hopefully we can get a good start."
