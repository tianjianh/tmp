The Canadian has won two league titles in over 300 games for the Giants since his arrival in 2011.
"The passion that the fans bring to our games makes me and the team want to continue to play hard for them," said Keefe on Wednesday.
"That has been the driving force for me to come back."
Keefe has scored 56 goals and added 74 assists - good for 130 total points in his Belfast career.
He added: "After my first season here, winning a league championship along with my experience of the fans and the city, I have been hungry to continue to bring trophies back to the city."
"We need to get on the right track starting early next season so we can get off to a good start and get the ball rolling."
