Jobs axed as Unipart Automotive goes into administration

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A car parts firm has gone into administration with the loss of 1,244 jobs, including 78 in Wales.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Unipart Automotive staff in Cardiff, Newport, Trealaw, Swansea, Lllanelli, Bangor, Llandudno, Porthmadog and Wrexham are all affected.
The Carmarthen branch has been bought by The Parts Alliance Ltd.
The company, based in Solihull, West Midlands, has gone into administration with the loss of 1,244 jobs following "financial stress" in recent years.
A total of 33 sites around the country have been sold as ongoing concerns.
Joint administrator Mark Orton, of KPMG, said: "Despite intensive efforts over recent weeks, a sale of the whole Unipart Automotive business could not be reached, and a buyer could only be found for 33 of the sites on a going concern basis.
"Unfortunately, the business had been experiencing financial stress for a number of years, so the level of cash and further operational restructuring required to rescue a more substantial part of the business posed too much risk for most interested parties."
He said they would be reviewing the options for the remainder of the business and assisting staff with redundancy and job seeker services.
