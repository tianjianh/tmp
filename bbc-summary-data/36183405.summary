The Scotland forward has scored 39 goals this season to lead Ronny Deila's side to the brink of retaining the Premiership title.
Team-mate Kieran Tierney won the Young Player of the Year award.
Mark Warburton was named manager of the year on a night when Rangers won three awards.
Ibrox captain Lee Wallace was also named Championship player of the year, while Barrie McKay's strike against Celtic in the Scottish Cup semi-final was voted goal of the season.
Dunfermline's Moroccan forward Faissal el Bakhtaoui won the League One award, while East Fife's Nathan Austin was player of the year for League Two.
Griffiths held off competition from Aberdeen winger Jonny Hayes, and Dundee duo Kane Hemmings and Greg Stewart.
He was given his prize at the Glasgow Hilton hotel a day after he scored the third goal in Celtic's 3-1 win over Hearts at Tynecastle, which all but sealed the league title for a fifth time in a row.
Celtic need just a point from their final three games to be crowned champions.
Left-back Tierney, 18, has been one of the stand outs for Celtic this season with 32 appearances.
He also made his Scotland debut in a 1-0 win over Denmark in March.
Rangers manager Warburton beat off competition from Ross County's Jim McIntyre, fellow Championship boss Peter Houston, and Peterhead's Jim McInally.
The Englishman took over at Ibrox last summer, leading Rangers to promotion to the Premiership and to the Petrofac Training Cup.
The former Brentford manager could also add the Scottish Cup to his list of honours should they defeat Hibernian at Hampden on 21 May.
