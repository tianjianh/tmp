'Discriminatory' rule keeping families apart, claims MP

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A "discriminatory" law means British people on low incomes who marry foreign nationals are unable to live with their partners in the UK, according to an MP.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
UK citizens must prove an annual income of Â£18,600 or have Â£62,500 in savings to bring a spouse into the country.
Dwyfor Meirionnydd MP Liz Saville Roberts will raise the question of Hailey Aldirmaz of Pwllheli, whose Turkish husband was refused a visa.
A Home Office spokesman said she did not satisfy financial requirements.
Mrs Aldirmaz, 26, married Turkish national Hasan four years ago and the couple have two children together.
But the trainee teaching assistant will not pass the minimum financial threshold needed to bring him to the UK when she starts work.
Ms Saville Roberts said the rules discriminate against low-pay earners, with more than half of full-time workers in her constituency taking home a wage below the threshold.
She told BBC Radio Wales' Good Morning Wales programme: "We are looking at people who are working not on benefits and it is a loving marriage."
The MP will raise the matter in the House of Commons, saying the ruling "prejudices against" low-earners and people in rural areas, where wages are usually lower.
She added Mrs Aldirmaz' situation was affecting the couple's children and that other means must be used to establish if a marriage is genuine.
A Home Office spokesman said it welcomes those who want to make a life in the UK, but said: "Family life must not be established here at the taxpayer's expense".
"Mr Aldirmaz's application was refused because it did not meet the financial requirements of the immigration rules," the spokesman added.
