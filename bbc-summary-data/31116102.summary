[SN]TITLE[SN]
Real cash in French board game

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
At least 80 copies of a French board game have been released containing real money - instead of toy cash.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
It's 80 years since Monopoly was released in France and the makers of the game have sent out the new copies to attract some attention.
Only one of the games will contain all real money - totalling around Â£15,000 (20,580 euros).
The rest of the games will have smaller amount of money inside.
