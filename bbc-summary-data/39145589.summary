Tuxedo Royale: Removal plan for River Tees 'eyesore'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A derelict former floating nightclub which is slowly sinking into the River Tees is to be dismantled.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Tuxedo Royale closed in 2006 and its owners later went into administration, leaving no-one responsible for maintenance or repair.
It is now derelict and partly resting on the river bed.
Proposed restoration plans came to nothing and so Middlesbrough Council has now drawn up plans to remove and dispose of it.
Councillor Charlie Rooney, Middlesbrough's deputy mayor, said: "While we appreciate there are those who would like to see the Tuxedo Royale moved and restored, sadly no viable proposals have been put forward that would make that possible.
"As things stand - and have done for many years - the vessel is an eyesore that has no owner and has effectively been abandoned.
"Not only is it potentially dangerous, but it continues to detract from the ambitious plans we have for Middlehaven including a snow centre on nearby land.
"This proposal is the only viable answer to a problem which, through no fault of ours or [demolition firm] Able UK's, has been left to us both to deal with."
