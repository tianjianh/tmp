[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Parkes, 25, scored one goal in 44 appearances for the Os in his one season at Brisbane Road, but was unable to help keep the club in League Two.
The Nottinghamshire-born centre-half started at Leicester and also played for Burton. Yeovil and Bristol Rovers.
"Tom is a very combative centre-back," manager Keith Curle said.
"Ultimately he likes to defend and there are parts of his game we know we can benefit from greatly."
