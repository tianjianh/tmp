V Festival police seize 17,000 gas canisters

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
More than 17,000 canisters of laughing gas were seized by police at V Festival in Chelmsford following a ban enforced by the city council.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Essex Police said it used the new Public Space Protection Order (PSPO) to seize legal highs, including nitrous oxide, and eject 248 people.
The PSPO applied to Hylands Park and surrounding roads over the weekend and prohibited the possession, supply, consumption and sale of legal highs.
Police also arrested 63 people.
Fifty-three of the arrests were for drug-related offences, the same as last year.
Figures are not held for the number of canisters police confiscated at V Festival 2014, when a PSPO did not exist, a spokeswoman said.
