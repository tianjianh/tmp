Headline Numbers: Voters 'rising faster than population'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The rules about how people register to vote changed last year, and some people were worried they might lead to a fall in the number of people registered to vote.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Instead of somebody from a household registering everybody in that household to vote, all individuals are now responsible for their own registration.
The change was made in England and Wales in June and in Scotland in September after the referendum. Northern Ireland has had individual registration since 2002.
The group most affected has been students. Previously, a university could just give a list of eligible voters to the local authority. Now all students have to register themselves.
But the latest estimate from the Electoral Commission suggests this hasn't happened. While individual local authorities have the figures for their electorates, they have not yet been collated into a national figure.
The most recent official figure we have is from the ONS for December 2014, which showed that there were 45,325,100 people registered to vote in the UK, which was down 1.8% on the previous year.
But there has been a big drive for people to register to vote ahead of the general election, and the Electoral Commission estimates that there are now about 49 million people registered, which would be a rise of 7.5% from the 45.6 million registered voters in 2010.
How does that compare with the population as a whole? In the middle of 2010 the UK population was 62.8 million. We do not have an official figure for the current UK population, but the ONS estimates that it's about 64.9 million. That would be an increase of about 3.3%.
Now, it should be said that a great deal of caution is needed around the Electoral Commission's estimate, and there is also uncertainty around the population projections.
But there does seem to be a big gap between the growth in registered voters and the growth of the population as a whole.
That suggests if the Electoral Commission is right, the campaign to encourage people to register to vote before the 20 April deadline was very successful and that the introduction of individual voter registration has not had as big an impact as was feared.
We will not know for sure until the actual national registration figures are known after the election.
