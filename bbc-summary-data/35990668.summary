Carla Whitlock acid attack trial: Defendant 'fuming angry' at acid attack

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man who denies throwing acid on a woman said he was "fuming angry" at his brother after hearing about the attack.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Billy Midmore, 22, denies causing grievous bodily harm with intent, a charge that his brother Geoffrey, 26, has pleaded guilty to.
Mr Midmore said he had no involvement in the attack on Carla Whitlock in Southampton, which left her blind in one eye.
He admitted sending her threatening texts.
CCTV footage of the moment a Ms Whitlock was attacked with drain cleaner containing sulphuric acid on 18 September last year, was shown to the jury at Southampton Crown Court on Wednesday.
The prosecution has previously claimed that the attack, which happened outside Turtle Bay in the city's Guildhall Square, was revenge for a drug deal that went wrong.
Mr Midmore said he was angry at Ms Whitlock after his brother was robbed of Â£2,000 worth of drugs and cash and subsequently sent her threatening texts.
He has denied buying the acid and being present during the attack.
Earlier prosecutor Kerry Maylin told the jury that Geoffrey Midmore had sent a photograph of the bottle on WhatsApp to an acquaintance together with the words: "This is one face melter."
The trial continues.
