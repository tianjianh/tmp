Stowaway cat survives five-hour flight

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A cat called Bisou has survived a five-hour flight from Egypt hidden in its owner's suitcase.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Mervat Ciuiti was in Cairo, packing her cases for a trip to Nottinghamshire, when the Persian puss snuck into her bag.
She only discovered the stowaway feline when she was in a taxi in the UK.
Luckily the seven-year-old cat survived the freezing temperatures in the cargo hold unharmed.
Egyptian animal laws say Bisou can't return home for six months and UK rules says Bisou must stay in quarantine - so Bisou is spending the rest of her stay at a quarantine centre in Derbyshire.
