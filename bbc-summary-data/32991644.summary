In 1962, Beryl Swain from Walthamstow, became the first female solo rider to compete on the Mountain circuit.
The following year, the International Federation of Motorcycling, revoked her licence on the grounds that the sport was not suitable for women.
Manx National Heritage said Fast Women, tells Swain's story alongside other "trailblazers and modern day heroines".
A spokesman added: "Beryl's modern day successors featured in the display include Jenny Tinmouth, who broke the record as the fastest female around the Mountain Course as a newcomer in 2009.
"Also, Carolynn Sells who made history in 2009 when she became the first ever female to win on the mountain circuit when she came in first in the Ultra lightweight MGP".
Fast Women, a free exhibition at the Manx Museum in Douglas, is open until 6 August.
