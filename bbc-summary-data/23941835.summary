Computer salesman Gary Tweddle, 23, originally from Reading, was last seen at a business conference in Leura, west of Sydney, in July.
New South Wales Police said his body was recovered after it was spotted this week on a cliff edge by an ambulance helicopter on a training mission.
Mr Tweddle's family positively identified the body earlier.
Police are preparing a report for the coroner.
Mr Tweddle, who had been living in Sydney, disappeared after a work dinner in Leura.
He made a phone call to colleagues in the early hours of 17 July to say he was lost in bushland.
More than 1,000 people searched cliffs and gullies with helicopters, by abseiling and using bushwalkers.
His body was spotted near Leura at about 16:00 local time (07:00 BST) on Monday.
Joanne Elliott, a spokeswoman for Blue Mountains Local Area Command, said the "extremely rough terrain" meant police rescue officers had been unable to retrieve the body until first light.
Police previously said they were treating his disappearance as "accidental death".
