Nottinghamshire quarrying plans go to consultation

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Nottinghamshire County Council's plans to explore potential new gravel quarry sites are to go to public consultation.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Councillors approved their Minerals Local Plan, a blueprint for quarrying in the county until 2030, on Thursday.
Five new sand and gravel sites, including Barnby Moor, Botany Bay, Coddington, Flash Farm and Shelford, have been proposed.
The plan will later be submitted to the government's planning inspector following the consultation.

The Trent Valley is a major source of sand and gravel, and Nottinghamshire is the biggest producer of these two minerals in the East Midlands, according to the council.
The plan, which has been around since 2011, also recommends extensions to 14 existing quarries.
However, the proposals have not gone down well with people living nearby.
Land near Barton-in-Fabis was included in the original minerals plan and villagers were concerned the "wonderful green lung" would be "trashed".
However, the area has since been deselected but residents still have concerns over the Shelford site.
The authority said planning permission would still be required before any development could take place and effects on transport, the environment and wildlife, would be considered.
The six-week consultation will begin in February.
