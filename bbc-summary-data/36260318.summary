Abusive messages between a man accused of beating his six-year-old daughter to death in a fit of rage and his partner have been read to a court.

According to the texts, Ben Butler's partner Jennie Gray was kicked out of their home after having an abortion.
Mr Butler had allegedly said it was "irresponsible and shocking" that she was pregnant.
The 36-year-old denies murdering Ellie Butler in October 2013 at their home in Sutton, south west London.
On 16 January, Mr Butler expressed his "disgust" that Miss Gray was pregnant, and told her he had "had enough of ur weight and looks and the trouble you bring (sic)".
Days later, she complained at his lack of support and he responded with abusive language, adding: "Don't text me going to explode."
In March the messages suggested he had attacked Miss Gray, locking her out of their home while she was bleeding badly from an abortion, the Old Bailey heard.
The next day, as she was going to hospital, he pleaded for her to to talk to him but added it was "partly your fault".
The court heard she later replied: "I am bleeding and ignoring it and pain. All for U, pretending u didn't make me kill a baby u didn't want."
However, in the wake of Ellie's death, Ms Gray, also 36, dismissed the texts, telling police they were "not nice" but it was "how he articulates himself".
In a prepared statement she said: "I have not suffered violence from Ben Butler and am certainly not afraid of him, do not feel threatened or controlled by him."
Jurors were also told Mr Butler had been convicted for twice assaulting his ex-girlfriend Hannah Hillman.
He had also previously pleaded guilty to battery after punching a man in a Wimbledon kebab shop who he thought had "touched up" Ms Gray, the court heard.
The case continues.
