A British tourist missing in Peru was seen by a local shortly after he was reported to have disappeared, a charity has said.

Harry Greaves went missing on 7 April after he announced plans to spend his birthday on a solo mountain walk.
The Lucie Blackman Trust said it was using drones to scour the area around the village of Pisac.
Mr Greaves was reportedly seen heading towards the village, although the sighting is unconfirmed.
The 29-year-old, who is originally from Bronygarth near Oswestry, Shropshire, was expected to return on 10 April.

His father, Simon, told BBC News he has been spending most of his time "by the telephone and computer" at home in the UK, waiting for news from family in Peru.
He described his son as "intelligent, idealistic, resourceful and resilient" but said family and friends were "deeply worried" about his disappearance.
"On a personal level I'm not sleeping very much or eating a great deal," he said.
"I spend most of the day by the telephone or at the computer. We're supported by lots of very special friends.
"People everywhere have been so supportive and they've sent us great love."
He said the trust has told him Russian helicopters might be deployed as part of the search, although that has not been confirmed.
Mr Greaves, a furniture maker who lives in Wrexham, arrived in Peru on 20 February, and attended a permaculture course before visiting friends.
He had emailed his family twice to tell them how much he was enjoying the visit.
Ellen Greaves said a yellow tent spotted on a mountainside was almost certainly not owned by her brother.
She said the British Embassy was now assisting, but called for a "more co-ordinated effort" from authorities.
"What we really need is for someone to be a central point of contact and co-ordinate the search and rescue," she said.
"So far it's been Harry's friends - they're doing an amazing job, but they're not experienced in this."
Relatives have set up a fundraising page to find Mr Greaves, which has raised more than Â£31,000, exceeding its original Â£25,000 target.
"He is an extremely genuine and caring person who acts from his heart and with pure integrity," his family wrote on the page.
