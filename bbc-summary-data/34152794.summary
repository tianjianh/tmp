Welsh NHS care costs reclaim deadline set for October

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
People who believe their long-term care costs should have been paid for by the Welsh NHS are being urged to register to claim the money back.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Continuing NHS Healthcare can cover all the care costs of people with complex ongoing illnesses.
Health Minister Mark Drakeford promised claims would be managed promptly, after criticism of a backlog of cases.
Claimants now have until 1 October to register for costs incurred between 1 August 2013 and 30 September 2014.
For those found to be eligible, all care needs - including nursing home costs of up to Â£40,000 a year - are met by the NHS.
It is not means-tested and the funds are potentially available to anyone over the age of 18.
Local health boards are responsible for ruling on claims and paying the bill.
More than Â£50m in wrongly-paid care home fees and interest has already been returned to families in Wales, often after a lengthy delay.
Mr Drakeford said: "Health boards will provide free advice to individuals should they wish to make a claim and they will also complete the necessary work on their behalf."
He added: "These claims will be managed in a robust and timely manner.
"We are also working with health boards to ensure staff get it right first time to minimise the number of people who are unnecessarily paying for continuing healthcare."
People wishing to register a claim should contact their local health board.
