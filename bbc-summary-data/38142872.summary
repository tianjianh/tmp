An appeal to replace stolen gifts meant for critically ill children has raised more than Â£30,000 in one day.

It smashed its original target of replacing Â£3,000 worth of gifts and decorations taken from St Mary's Hospital in Paddington, central London.
Candles, decorations and several Santa suits have also been donated.
The donations will go towards a "bigger and better" Christmas party at St Mary's paediatric intensive care unit, officials said.
The unit at St Mary's treats children for conditions including meningitis, sepsis and trauma.
Vicky Rees, head of fundraising at Cosmic - the Children of St Mary's Intensive Care charity - said "smashing our target means we can do more activities for the children over Christmas".
"We're completely overwhelmed by the response" she said.
The funds will also be invested in specialist sensory material for children with severe impairments.
Tina Halton, lead play specialist St Mary's, said the money was "extraordinary".
"In other fields these figures are more normal, but we work on really small budgets".
Ms Halton said some of the comments flooding in were "just as important" as the donations.
"If you're a child in a hospital its very isolating, sending in messages shows the children that they're being thought about."
Hospital staff and local organisations have also volunteered their time to help organise the new party and wrap presents at short notice.
"Sometimes London can feel quite big, but today isn't one of those days," said Ms Halton.
The Met Police are still appealing for witnesses or anyone with information of the original theft to come forward.
