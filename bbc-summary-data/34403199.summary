The remains of the Lockheed P-38F Lightning, buried in sand at Harlech beach, is currently vulnerable to storm damage and trophy hunting.
A special survey of the site will assess whether it can be designated as a "scheduled ancient monument".
It is part of £121,404 Welsh government funding to protect ancient relics.
Other projects awarded grants included Brymbo Iron Works in Wrexham, the medieval pottery kiln at Newport Memorial Hall, Pembrokeshire, Penrice Castle in Swansea and Caerau Camp in Cardiff where works will be carried out to make repairs and improve public access.
Announcing the funding, deputy culture minister Ken Skates said: "All over Wales our landscape is scattered with ancient monuments.
"They shape our communities, tell the story of our past and bring economic benefits through tourism."
