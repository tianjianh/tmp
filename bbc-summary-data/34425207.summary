Different health boards treat woman's problem knees

A woman who has her right knee treated by one health board and left knee by another has written to Health Minister Mark Drakeford expressing frustration.

Jackie Sayce, 40, from Aberystwyth, has major problems in her left knee after an accident, aged three, and now has a problem in her right leg.
She said bureaucracy had caused the need for two different treatments.
But the Welsh government said it was a matter for Hywel Dda and Cardiff and Vale health boards.
Since her accident, Ms Sayce has had a number of operations and seen a specialist consultant at University Hospital Llandough, near Cardiff, for 15 years.
Her previously healthy right knee developed a problem due to years of over-compensation and she thought it would make sense to have both treated by her specialist.
But living in the Hywel Dda area, she was sent to her nearest suitable hospital, which is Prince Philip Hospital, in Llanelli instead.
"They would argue you need to be treated as close to home as possible so the first referral from your GP goes to your nearest hospital. So it doesn't go to your existing health care provider," she told BBC Wales.
"So whereas I was referred from Llandough to see a specialist within Llandough, Hywel Dda disagreed with that so they referred me to a surgeon in Llanelli.
"However that surgeon... said my surgeon was quite right and I need to go to Llandough for specialist treatment. That process has taken quite a long time to sort out."
Now she has developed a hip complaint and does not know where treatment will take place.
"It would be amazing if we could be treated as a whole person - as one individual," Ms Sayce added.
"Hywel Dda are quite capable of dealing with my routine issues but it makes it very complicated when I'm chasing up appointments and when you're trying to speak to somebody because paperwork gets lost."
Kathryn Davies from Hywel Dda University Health Board said individual cases could not be discussed.
But she said: "We have agreed to review and amend our cross boundary referral policy to ensure we minimise any delay in referrals between different providers and do not disadvantage our patients."
Cardiff and Vale University Health Board said it had not received any referral for Ms Sayce from Hywel Dda.
