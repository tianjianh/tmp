Left-armer Shamsi, 27, made his international T20 debut during June's series against England and has also featured in one Test match.
He will play the first of his three games against Derbyshire on 7 July.
"He's a very effective leg-spinner which I believe is crucial in modern T20 cricket," said coach David Ripley.
