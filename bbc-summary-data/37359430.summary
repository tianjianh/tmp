Station head Vadim Plotnikov said 10 adult bears and four cubs had surrounded the station since 31 August.
The bears had prevented the scientists from performing some observations and one scientist's dog was killed.
The scientists asked for flares for scaring off the bears and other items.
Vassiliy Shevchenko, who works for the state monitoring network that owns the weather station, told BBC News an Arctic vessel had reached a nearby island and the supplies had been sent in from there by helicopter.
All of the scientists are reported to be well.
The polar bear is the largest living land carnivore, weighing up to 800kg (1,763 pounds).
According to the World Wildlife Foundation, polar bears are considered a vulnerable species. The biggest threat to the animals is the loss of their habitat due to climate change.
