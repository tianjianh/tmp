[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Chris Bakken, the project director for Hinkley Point C in Somerset, will take up a new role at US energy company Entergy in April.
EDF Energy said he had decided to return to his home country to pursue "new professional opportunities" and spend more time with his family.
He has been in charge of the Â£18bn Hinkley Point C project since 2011.
A final investment decision for the nuclear project was postponed by EDF Energy last month.
Hinkley is due to start generating power in 2025, and is expected to provide 7% of the UK's electricity once it is running.
