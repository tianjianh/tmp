Rotherham United 1-2 Cardiff City

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Cardiff City came from behind to stun Rotherham at the New York Stadium thanks to a Rickie Lambert double.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The former Liverpool striker scored twice in five minutes to ease the pressure on boss Paul Trollope.
The Millers led through Isaiah Brown's goal on the hour mark, before former England striker Lambert changed the contest with his first Cardiff goals.
He headed home a Peter Whittingham free kick before firing-in a deflected winner on 79 minutes.
The Millers had lost only one of their last 12 league games at home, but were leapfrogged by the Bluebirds who climbed out of the Championship relegation zone thanks to a first away win since March.
Cardiff rise to 21st in the Championship, with the defeat sending Rotherham into the bottom three as they slip to 23rd.
Cardiff, who had conceded eight goals this season in the final 15 minutes of matches, flipped the script by scoring late to gain a measure of revenge for last season's injury-time defeat to the Millers.
Goalkeeper Ben Amos was the key figure for the Bluebirds in the first period, impressing with some important saves on the day that the goalkeeper he replaced, David Marshall, made his Premier League debut for Hull City at Anfield.
Amos had to save adroitly on 16 minutes to deny Dael Fry after Cardiff failed to clear from a Joe Newell free kick.
The summer signing was also called into action when Danny Ward fired across goal, saving low to his right and tipping the ball onto the post before Brown fired over the rebound.
That represented the best chance of the first period with Cardiff reduced to speculative efforts, with Lambert, Lex Immers and Joe Ralls all failing to find the target with long-range strikes.
Cardiff arrived in Yorkshire having experienced their worst start to a league season since 2004.
However, Rickie Lambert's first goal for Cardiff since his transfer deadline day switch earned Paul Trollope's men parity after Brown's opener.
There was a touch of luck about his second goal, sweeping home via a deflection on the counter-attack to completely wrong-foot goalkeeper Lee Camp, with Cardiff hanging on to secure a vital victory.
Rotherham manager Alan Stubbs:
"This is a tough one to take because we deserved more from the game than what we got.
"I can't fault the players effort and desire because they are not getting the rewards that they deserve. We cannot afford to feel sorry for ourselves, the second goal sums up the bad luck we are having.
"Realistically we should be sitting on 12 to 13 points. We have to keep working hard and doing the work on the training ground."
Cardiff City manager Paul Trollope:
"Rickie Lambert has got the respect of the dressing because of what he has done in his career. He has a real hunger to play for the club and we are delighted he has got off the mark.
"He is a real leader of men and we are really pleased with his contribution and his link up play. We have to get things correct around him to maximise his ability.
"The players showed great spirit, character and resilience. We worked hard in the week on the mental side of the game and we spoke about having the desire to win the game no matter what happened."
