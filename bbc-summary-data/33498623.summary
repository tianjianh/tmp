[SN]TITLE[SN]
HMS Trincomalee becomes oldest warship afloat in the world

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A warship berthed in Hartlepool has become the oldest still afloat in the world.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
HMS Trincomalee has gained the title temporarily after the USS Constitution was moved to dry dock until 2017 for a major restoration.
The vessel, built in India in 1817, lies afloat at Hartlepool's Maritime Experience where it has been a tourist attraction for nearly 30 years.
HMS Trincomalee general manager David McKnight said it was a "great honour".
USS Constitution first went to sea in 1797 while HMS Trincomalee first set sail twenty years later in 1817.
HMS Trincomalee was built for the Admiralty in Bombay and served in the West Indies and the Pacific.
The ship was brought to Hartlepool in 1987, where it took more than 10 years to restore.
Mr McKnight said: "Trincomalee is a wonderful elder lady of the sea who certainly has some tales to tell of life on the high seas.
"She is a very prominent and iconic landmark in Hartlepool whom the people of the area and indeed the region have taken to their hearts."
