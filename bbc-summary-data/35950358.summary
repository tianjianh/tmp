[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
James Wilson was shot in the chest by officers who were called to Frenchman's Way at about 01:00 BST on 29 March, to reports of a man in the street with a handgun.
The 24-year-old was taken to Newcastle's Royal Victoria Infirmary, but died late on Friday.
An Independent Police Complaints Commission investigation into the incident is ongoing.
IPCC Commissioner Carl Gumsley said: "Our thoughts are with James' friends and family at this very difficult time."
On Wednesday, investigators said a "non-police weapon" had been recovered from the scene.
