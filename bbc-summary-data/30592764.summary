Gabriel Agbonlahor: Aston Villa forward's red card appeal successful

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Aston Villa forward Gabriel Agbonlahor has won his appeal against the red card he received during Saturday's 1-1 draw with Manchester United.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 28-year-old was dismissed in the second half for a late challenge on former team-mate Ashley Young.
He will now be available for the Boxing Day trip to Swansea City.
But Aston Villa have been charged with failing to "ensure their players conducted themselves in an orderly fashion" following the incident.
The club have until 18:00 GMT on 30 December to respond.
Had Agbonlahor's appeal against his red card been unsuccessful, he would have been banned for three matches.
