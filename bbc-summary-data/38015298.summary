Australian half-back Chris Sandow's exit from Warrington was not a shock, says Wolves head coach Tony Smith.

The 27-year-old did not report for pre-season training on Monday and his agent told the club he would not see out the final year of his contract.
Sandow made 20 Super League appearances in 2016 and played in the Grand Final.
"The timing of it wasn't great, but Chris is erratic like he is on the field," Smith said.
"I wasn't overly shocked. The timing and the method of informing us was poor, but aside from that there were no grand shocks."
Former Parramatta Eels and South Sydney Rabbitohs back Sandow has stated that he did not return to Warrington for family reasons.
"I should have been a man about it and explained to them what was happening," he told Fox Sports.
"I'm from an Aboriginal community and communication isn't something that always comes natural to me.
"I went over there at the back end of last year and it's a good club to go to. But it's hard to go back knowing what I've got here in Australia and that's family.
"They're number one, family is the most important thing to me and that's why I made the decision not to go back to England."
Warrington have retained the player's registration if he wishes to join an NRL club.
And, asked if he had any regrets about signing the player, Smith told BBC Radio Merseyside: "No, he did some terrific stuff along the way and he contributed.
"We knew what we were getting into and he didn't cause any major hassles off the field. He showed at times how outstanding he can be."
Former Huddersfield, Leeds and Great Britain coach Smith said the club are already looking at potential replacements for next season.
"We've had plenty of contact from a lot of keen and interested people and so we'll be in the market; we've got some money to play with," he added.
"We've promoted from within in the past and we've got some good junior boys within our ranks but we're not going to rush into anything just yet."
