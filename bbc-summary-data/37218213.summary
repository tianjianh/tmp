Designed to appeal to Pokemon Go fans, the Bulbasaur burger has lots of leafy greens, Pikachu has lots of cheese to match his yellow colour and Charmander has spicy salt salsa.
Hundreds of people have been queuing outside the restaurant to buy the burgers but only 100 burgers are being made per day, for just a few days.
The burgers are given randomly to customers, because the manager was concerned that the Pikachu burgers would sell more than the others.
