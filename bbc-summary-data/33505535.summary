The Dow Jones closed up 214.53 points, or 1.2%, at 17,979.94. The S&P 500 rose 22.98 points, or 1.11%, to 2,099.60.
The tech-heavy Nasdaq added 73.82 points, or 1.48%, to 5, 071.51.
Software giant Microsoft was up by 2% after saying it would launch Windows 10 on 29 July. Other winners included Intel, Caterpillar and Nike.
The EU has spoken of up to â‚¬86bn (Â£61bn; $95bn) of financing for Greece over three years.
"For the markets, it's clearly a positive that there is an agreement among the European member states and that there is an atmosphere of co-operation," said Philippe Gijsels, head of research at BNP Paribas Fortis Global Markets in Brussels.
"Still, there is a bit of execution risk which may haunt us in terms of volatility."
