Administrators confirmed the redundancies affecting 38 staff at Galashiels-based Murray and Burrell.
The business, established in 1928, went into administration last week citing "adverse trading conditions".
There are hopes some of the workers affected could find posts at another building firm in nearby Melrose which currently requires staff.
Thomson Cooper partner Richard Gardiner was appointed as administrator at Murray and Burrell on Monday.
A statement confirmed: "Directors explored all options in an effort to preserve trading and jobs.
"Regrettably, 38 jobs were lost as there is no prospect of continuing to trade."
South of Scotland MSP Rachael Hamilton described it as a "sad day for the Borders".
However, some of the workers laid off could find employment with a Melrose-based company.
JS Crawford has said that, with several housing projects on its books, it needs staff.
