Nottinghamshire care homes: Three of six to stay open temporarily

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Three of six care homes threatened with closure will remain open for an additional three years under proposals from a county council.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Under the Nottinghamshire County Council plan, the other three council-run homes will close as planned within a year in a bid to save £4m a year.
The county council said it was too expensive to modernise the homes, which would cost at least £24m.
Around 9,000 people signed petitions against the closures.
Leivers Court in Gedling, Bishop's Court in Ollerton and James Hince Court in Worksop would remain open for an additional three years under the plans.
The three care homes that are closing are Woods Court in Newark,  St.Michael's View in Retford and Kirklands at Kirkby in Ashfield. They are expected to close "within the next year", but no firm timetable has been set.
All six homes will eventually be replaced by extra care centres, where residents will have support but be more independent.
The three-year extension to the homes will "reduce pressure on NHS hospital beds, create more extra places and support families and carers", the council said.
Councillor Muriel Weisz said it is "investing £12.65m on extra care schemes across the county to widen the choice and variety of care and support that is available to local older people."
The revised plans will be considered at a full meeting on 26 February.
