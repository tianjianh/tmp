Wendy Ruddock, 37, said partner Ian, 34, shouted out after baby Olivia stopped breathing during a feed.
Mr Ruddock denies compressing Olivia's chest, shaking her and inflicting blunt force trauma to her head.
The attacks are alleged to have taken place at the family home in Clarkston, East Renfrewshire, in March 2011.
The High Court in Edinburgh heard how Mr Ruddock performed CPR on the baby before she was taken to the Royal Hospital for Sick Children at Yorkhill, Glasgow.
Mrs Ruddock said she remembered seeing the infant "hooked up to a lot of machines" at the hospital.
However, the court heard that doctors concluded she could not survive her injuries.
Mrs Ruddock told the court her husband had got up from bed in the early hours one morning to feed their daughter.
But Olivia became unwell during the feed, prompting him to shout for her.
Mrs Ruddock told prosecution lawyer Ashley Edwards: "I knew something wasn't right.
"He shouted on me to phone an ambulance which I did immediately.
"The person on the other end of the phone was trying to talk us through CPR. But it was just panic stations."
Mrs Ruddock said her husband performed CPR on Olivia "as best he could".
She also told the court that Mr Ruddock was "good" with children.
"He certainly was very good with children," she said. "He was good with my nieces and nephews. Whenever there was a family get together they would go to him.
Mr Ruddock is also accused of attempting to murder another child in 2013 at an address in Glasgow.
He has pleaded not guilty to the charges and the trial before judge Lord Bannatyne continues.
