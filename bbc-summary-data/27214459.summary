Middlesex v Yorkshire: Chris Rogers inspires remarkable win

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Captain Chris Rogers led from the front with 241 not out as Middlesex set a new record by making 472-3 to beat Yorkshire by seven wickets.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Australian opener hit 37 boundaries and shared an unbroken fourth-wicket stand of 145 with Neil Dexter (72).
In their victory over Yorkshire, Middlesex beat their previous highest fourth innings chase at Lord's of 366-5 against Sussex in 1926.
It was the highest winning fourth-innings score made by Middlesex at Lord's, but short of their club record 502-6 at Notts at Trent Bridge in 1925.
It was only the third time Yorkshire have conceded over 400 to lose a game.
In 2009, they were beaten by four wickets at Taunton when Somerset made 479-6, three years after Hampshire scored 404-5 to in by five wickets at Headingley.
Rogers also made some individual history with the 11th fourth innings double-century in the Championship, as he matched the 241 not out made by fellow Australian Justin Langer against Kent in 1999.
It was the 67th first-class score of over 100 in the left-hander's career, lifting his average to exactly 50.
The 36-year-old survived a big lbw appeal from Ryan Sidebottom early on the fourth morning after the home side resumed on 230-1 and later nicked Jack Brooks through the slips, but otherwise was in full control as Yorkshire's attack toiled in vain to dislodge him.
It was a tough first taste of Championship captaincy for England's Joe Root, in charge because county captain Andrew Gale had dropped himself.
Sidebottom did succeed in having Dawid Malan (35) lbw and Kane Williamson's off-spin accounted for Eoin Morgan (27), but Dexter finished the match in style, striking Williamson for two fours and a six in the space of four deliveries.
Middlesex skipper Chris Rogers told BBC London 94.9:

"It's been a great day. Hopefully, the club can go from strength to strength from that. In a fourth innings, to play like that and win, doesn't happen every day.
"To get over the line is something to be very proud of. But the other guys deserve a lot of credit too. They came out and played very well and took the pressure off me.
"It was almost a perfect run chase. We've been criticised for our batting, so that can be an excellent step for us."
Yorkshire coach Jason Gillespie:
"It was a fantastic knock. Sometimes you have to take your hat off to the opposition.
"We gave it our best, but it just didn't quite work in the second innings with the ball.
"You can't rest on your laurels, you need to make sure your skills are right each and every over."
BBC London 94.9's Kevin Hand:
"Middlesex completed their highest run chase at Lord's, the third highest on the ground and the third highest in their history.
"Chris Rogers, unbeaten on 241, was just four runs short of equalling the highest individual score in a successful fourth innings chase.
"The innings victory must be regarded as very close to the greatest in the county's 150-year history."
