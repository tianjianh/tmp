[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Steve Finnigan, who has led Lancashire Constabulary for 11 years, will stand down in June.
Mr Finnigan has been with the force since 2001, when he joined as Assistant Chief Constable after rising through the ranks at Merseyside Police, for whom he had served since 1976.
He was appointed CBE in 2010.
During his time as chief constable, Mr Finnigan has been at the helm during high profile investigations into the Morecambe Bay cockle pickers' tragedy, as well as anti-terrorist operations.
He earned the Queen's Policing Medal in 2006 and was appointed CBE in 2010.
Lancashire's Police and Crime Commissioner Clive Grunshaw said: "I want to thank Steve personally for his very dedicated service.
"Lancashire's position as one of the best in the country has been secured under Steve's watch and he deserves a great deal of credit for that."
Mr Grunshaw's spokesman said Mr Finnigan was the longest serving chief constable in the United Kingdom.
The closing date for applications for Mr Finnigan's successor is 13 February, with the successful candidate expected to start on 1 July.
