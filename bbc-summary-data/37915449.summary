A woman killed by her ex-boyfriend suffered injuries which could have been caused by a crowbar, a court has heard.

David Nicholas Davies, 25, of Clynnog, near Caernarfon, has admitted murdering Emma Louise Baum at her home in Penygroes, Gwynedd, in July 2016.
However, he disputes the full case against him and denies using a knife or taking a weapon to the murder scene.
On Tuesday, Mold Crown Court heard the injuries were "entirely consistent" with the use of a crowbar.
Ms Baum had at least 20 injuries to her head, including stab wounds, which the prosecution alleged were consistent with the use of a knife.
But Home Office pathologist Dr Alison Armour, who carried out the post mortem examination, told the court the injuries were caused by "deliberate, thrusting actions" with the sharp end of the crowbar.
Simon Mills, prosecuting, said no crowbar had been found despite extensive police searches.
"The prosecution contends that if a crowbar had been discarded or thrown in this area, it would have been found, even if underwater," he said.
Earlier, the court heard from witnesses who claimed Davies said he wanted to kill Ms Baum and "could put her in a box".
Dafydd Roberts, defending, said his client denied making the comments.
The case, known as a Newton hearing, continues.
