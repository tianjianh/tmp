[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Repairs to a railway line in East Sussex following a landslip are now likely to take another six to eight weeks, Network Rail has said.

Trains from Eastbourne to Lewes are limited to 5mph while engineers shore up a bank between Glynde and Berwick stations.
Passengers were originally told disruption would last at least a week.
Network Rail said it was an isolated site and it had to build a road across fields for its heavy equipment.
The landslip on saturated ground began on 10 March and became worse over two days, when Network Rail had to impose speed restrictions.
Engineers have put steel sheets into clay to shore up a new embankment.
Network Rail said it planned to repair 250m of damaged railway to modern standards.
Geotechnical manager Derek Butcher said: "We appreciate everyone's patience while this work takes place and we will have the line working at full speed as soon as we can. By reducing the number of trains over the affected area, we also reduce the risk of the slip getting worse."
Southern services from Ashford International to Brighton are terminating at Eastbourne until the repairs are complete.
The rail firm, which operates through Sussex and parts of Surrey, Kent and Hampshire, has advised passengers to check its website before travelling.
