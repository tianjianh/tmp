Wales' 32-8 defeat by Australia was caused by "silly mistakes" in the first half, says captain Gethin Jenkins.

Australia led 20-3 at half-time at the Principality Stadium and finished the game with five tries as they beat Wales for the 12th time in succession.
"We lost that game in the first half and we will have to have a look at it and see where we went wrong," Blues prop Jenkins told BBC Sport.
"It was always an an uphill task to get back in that game."
Tries from Australia captain Stephen Moore, Reece Hodge and Tevita Kuridrani gave the visitors a formidable lead at the interval.
Despite Scott Williams' try for Wales midway through the second period, Bernard Foley and Dane Haylett-Petty crossed as Australia opened their tour with a comfortable victory.

"We probably forced it a little bit too much in the first 20 minutes of the second half," said Jenkins.
"We showed some good spirit to come back at the end and we probably could have got one more try.
"We didn't get our hands on the ball in the first half, we made a few big defensive errors which punished us."
Jenkins, making his 127th appearance for Wales, added he hoped his side would "bounce back" against Argentina next Saturday (17:30 GMT).
Australia fly-half Foley was named man of the match for a superb attacking display which he capped with a try in the second half.
"We prepared really well," he told BBC Sport. "We knew how dangerous this Welsh side is. They challenge us every time we play them and it's always a game full of physicality.
"Credit goes to the rest of the team. Our attack worked out of defence, who were really solid and that was the pleasing thing."
After a summer in which the Wallabies were whitewashed at home by England, Foley said the pressure is still on his side to perform.
"It doesn't relieve the pressure but we're here to play every game and go week by week," he added.
"It's an almighty tour for us and we wanted to start well."
Australia skipper Moore was pleased with his side's performance.
"I thought our attack functioned pretty well and we were pretty desperate in defence so it's a nice way to start the tour," he told BBC Sport.
"We had a few weeks to work on that stuff. You come into a game with a plan every time and it's nice when it comes off under pressure.
"The boys felt good. We had a good week of training and that's what is important."
