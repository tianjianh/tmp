[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The bodies of band Viola Beach - who died in a car crash in Sweden - have been released to their families.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Tomas Lowe, 27, Kris Leonard, River Reeves, and Jack Dakin, all 20, and their manager Craig Tarry, 33, were killed when their car plunged into a canal on 13 February.
Inquests into their deaths were opened and adjourned earlier in Warrington.
Senior Coroner for Cheshire Nicholas Rheinberg released the five men's bodies so funerals could take place.
The brief hearing at Warrington Town Hall was attended by 11 family members.
Det Sgt Elaine Duddle from Cheshire Police told the inquests the band's car was travelling along the E4 motorway and passed through a restricted area when it collided with barriers.
She said the five men suffered severe injuries and the car then fell into the canal below the bridge, about 18 miles from Stockholm in Sodertalje.
Mr Rheinberg heard that cooperation between UK and Swedish Police had been good since the crash in Stockholm last month.
He praised the work of the Swedish Police and said: "In all my career I have never had such immediate and positive response from a foreign organisation"
Full inquests will be heard at a later date.
