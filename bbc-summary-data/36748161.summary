Dockrell replaces injured Adair for ODI series with Afghanistan

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
George Dockrell will replace the injured Mark Adair in Ireland's 14-man squad for the one-day international series with Afghanistan.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The left-arm spinner was called up from the stand-by list after seam bowler Adair withdrew with a back injury sustained playing for Warwickshire.
Belfast-born Adair, 20, was in line for what could have been his first appearance as a senior international.
The first of the five-match series takes place at Stormont on Sunday.
Holywood's Adair has been ruled out for an initial two to three weeks and would not have been able to play any part in the series.
After spending this week at Stormont, Ireland head coach John Bracewell believes the wickets will suit spinners and so opted to call up Dockrell, who has been training with the squad.
Graeme McCarter and Max Sorensen remain on standby.
Sean Terry is the other new face in the Ireland squad for the series as Boyd Rankin and Sorensen were omitted from the squad which lost to Sri Lanka recently.
Warwickshire's Rankin is unavailable while Peter Chase and Tyrone Kane have earned recalls.
The other games will be played on 12, 14, 17 and 19 July.
Ireland squad (v Afghanistan): William Porterfield (capt) (Warwickshire), George Dockrell (Leinster Lightning), John Anderson (Leinster Lightning/Merrion), Peter Chase (Leinster Lightning/Malahide), Ed Joyce (Sussex), Tyrone Kane (Leinster Lightning/Merrion), Tim Murtagh (Middlesex), Andy McBrine (NW Warriors/Donemana), Barry McCarthy (Durham), Kevin O'Brien (Leinster Lightning/Railway Union), Stuart Poynter (Durham), Paul Stirling (Middlesex), Sean Terry (Leinster Lightning/YMCA), Gary Wilson (Surrey).
