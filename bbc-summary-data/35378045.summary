Crime victim services in England and Wales will receive the same level of funding in the next financial year.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Association of Police and Crime Commissioners says it will receive £63m in 2016-17, the same as in 2015-16.
It had asked the Ministry of Justice for a three-year grant to help plan for the long-term and give victims' groups more certainty.
Earlier, the association warned services could close or lose staff because funding had not been confirmed.
Justice Minister Mike Penning said he had written to all police and crime commissioners and victim support agencies to tell them their budget had been protected.
"The Ministry of Justice puts the highest emphasis on the needs of victims and these services are absolutely vital," he said.
"We have introduced a raft of new measures to help victims and with this funding will continue to ensure victims have access to the support they need to cope, and where possible, recover."
The association represents all 41 police and crime commissioners in England and Wales.
• female and male victims of sexual exploitation
• minority groups and refugee women, children and young victims
• victims of forced marriage, honour-based violence, domestic slavery, trafficking and female genital mutilation
• vulnerable children who are victims or who live with victims of crime and display harmful behaviours
• visually impaired adults who could be at risk of abuse and disability hate crime
