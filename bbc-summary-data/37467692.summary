RB Leipzig: Cologne fans' protest against Red Bull delays kick-off

Cologne's Bundesliga match against RB Leipzig on Sunday kicked off 15 minutes late because of protesting fans.

About 100 Cologne supporters blocked the arrival of Leipzig's team coach in protest at the away team's ownership by drinks manufacturer Red Bull.
"We had a bit of trouble getting to the stadium and we needed more time to prepare professionally for the match," said Leipzig coach Ralph Hasenhuettl.
Rival fans have described Leipzig as an artificial product.
The club was founded in 2009 and, with the backing of Red Bull, won four promotions in seven seasons to reach the top division of German football.
They are yet to lose a league game this season and drew 1-1 at Cologne, where former Nottingham Forest winger Oliver Burke, 19, became the first Scot to score in the Bundesliga for almost 17 years.
Under German football rules, the club cannot be called Red Bull Leipzig and are officially known as RasenBallsport Leipzig, or RB Leipzig.
They have been greeted by protests at other grounds over the past two years, with fans of local rivals Dynamo Dresden dumping a severed bull's head beside the pitch during a German Cup tie in August.
Sunday's sit-in at Cologne followed a midweek protest by Borussia Monchengladbach supporters, who stayed silent for the first 19 minutes of their match at RB Leipzig, reflecting the year of Monchengladbach's formation in 1900.
