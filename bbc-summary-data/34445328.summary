The developer behind the troubled Bristol North Baths complex says it has until the end of the year to complete.

Chatsworth Homes began redeveloping the Gloucester Road site into a library, health centre and flats in August 2012.
The firm had promised it would be complete by September but said the city council had now set a deadline of Christmas which it was "very confident" it could meet.
Bristol City Council was unavailable for comment.
The authority lent Chatsworth Homes around Â£3.8m to develop the site but  halted the project amid concerns about the quality of work.
Although the findings were not made public, the BBC understood several "failings" relating to fire risks, access problems and structural issues had been identified.
But Kevin Batt, the company's managing director, said the "stop and review" had "not been necessary" and only held up the project.
"We've been here a long time, much longer then anybody would have liked - including ourselves," he said.
"It's been a long hard battle but we're going to stay and we're going to finish this.
"I'm very confident that it will be done by Christmas."
