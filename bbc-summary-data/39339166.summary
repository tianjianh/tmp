A Christian Benteke double was not enough for Belgium as Russia staged a late comeback to draw their international friendly in Sochi.

Russia, World Cup hosts in 2018, led when Viktor Vasin side-footed home.
Everton's Kevin Mirallas levelled for the visitors, who took a 3-1 lead into the break with two headers from Crystal Palace striker Benteke.
Aleksey Miranchuk pulled one back with 15 minutes to go before Aleksandr Bukharov's 92nd-minute leveller.
Russia, who qualified for the World Cup automatically as hosts, have now won just one of their last five games, having suffered defeats by Costa Rica, Qatar and Ivory Coast in the last six months.
Belgium are top of their World Cup qualifying group at the halfway stage, but have now drawn three of their last four international matches.
Everton's Romelu Lukaku, the Premier League's top scorer, played the final 13 minutes for Belgium.
There were starts for Liverpool keeper Simon Mignolet, Tottenham defenders Toby Alderweireld and Jan Vertonghen and midfielder Mousa Dembele, while Chelsea forward Eden Hazard came on in the 85th minute.
