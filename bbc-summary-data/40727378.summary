Reports of sexual abuse and rape at the branches of Fosters Menswear in Salford and Ashton-under-Lyne, which have since closed down, have been made to Greater Manchester Police.
An 80-year-old man has been interviewed under caution.
Det Con Gary McCarthy said: "Our team is working hard to uncover the full extent of this historical sex abuse."
He praised the alleged victims for coming forward, adding: "We understand that reporting traumatic events can be extremely difficult, but I want to reassure anyone who is thinking about coming forward that we will be there to support them."
