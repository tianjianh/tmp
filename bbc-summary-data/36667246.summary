Police misconduct case over missing Dudley man

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Four police officers must answer claims of misconduct over a man who went missing and later committed suicide, according to its watchdog.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Kazimierz Radloff, 64, from Dudley, was found dead on 6 July last year.
The Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) said that two days before he was found relatives warned he indicated he intended to kill himself.
There was no indication earlier police intervention would have altered the outcome, the IPCC said.
West Midlands Police have now decided three police constables and an acting inspector will have to answer a case for misconduct.
They would be "subject to management action including words of advice," the IPCC said.
The investigation found police initially treated Mr Radloff as someone in breach of bail conditions rather than as a vulnerable missing person, it said.
Evidence indicated a lack of intelligence checks and information sharing meant opportunities were missed to escalate the search, the watchdog said.
The IPCC also said it recommended to the force that all officers should receive guidance on working with interpreters.
Mr Radloff committed suicide his inquest in August last year found.
