They're the creation of US robotics company Boston Dynamics.
Atlas can walk across rough ground with ease, and even balance on one leg while being hit from the side by a demolition ball.
And four-legged WildCat can gallop at 16 miles per hour.
The robots have been developed for a competition and could one day be used in emergency rescue situations.
