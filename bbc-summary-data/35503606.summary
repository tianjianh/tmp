The 26-year-old victim was attacked in the Chinese Gardens at the entrance to Rickerby Park early on 12 August.
Jonathan Corry, 24, of Longlands Road, Carlisle, was convicted following a crown court trial in December.
Judge Peter Davies sentenced him to a 10-year prison term, with an eight-month term for witness intimidation to run consecutively.
In addition, Corry, who had denied the charges, was made subject to sex offender notification requirements.
The court was told the victim met Corry on a night out in Carlisle city centre, after which she decided to walk to his house.
But as the pair approached the Chinese Gardens, Corry grabbed the woman, attacked and raped her.
She fled the scene and ran to a friend's house.
After the hearing, senior crown prosecutor Isla Chilton said: "This was a dreadful assault on a woman who was simply enjoying an evening out socialising.
"Jonathan Corry claimed that the victim consented, but this could not be further from the truth. He gave the victim the impression during the evening that he was a pleasant, friendly person, but without warning became violent when they were walking home alone.
"She was terrified and believed he was going to kill her.
"The victim has been extremely brave in reporting what happened and in giving evidence against him.  Because of her courage we have been able to bring to justice a violent sex offender and make sure he goes to prison where he can no longer pose a danger to other women."
