The 38-year-old journalist became well-known during the 2010 election as the BBC's chief political correspondent.
She then had a spell at ITV before returning to the BBC in 2014 on the Newsnight team.
Nick Robinson will join BBC Radio Four's Today programme in the autumn. He has taken time off recently to have chemotherapy to treat lung cancer.
Kuenssberg said: "I'm completely delighted and I recognise the responsibility on my shoulders.
"It's an honour for me to follow Nick Robinson who has been such an outstanding political editor."

BBC director-general Tony Hall said: "Laura's an exceptional journalist - I saw that for myself in our studio on election night.
"Her knowledge of Westminster politics is second to none, but she also has a real flair for asking the questions the audience want answering."
BBC director of news James Harding said there was no role quite like political editor at the BBC.
"It is one of the toughest and most influential jobs in journalism. I am delighted Laura will be our next voice from Westminster."
Kuenssberg was born in Italy, spent her childhood in Glasgow and gained a first class honours degree from Edinburgh University in modern history.
She joined the BBC in 2000 as a trainee journalist in Newcastle and became a political correspondent in 2003, working on the Daily Politics and the Today programme, Breakfast and the News at Ten.
In 2009, she was appointed the BBC's chief political correspondent, but moved to ITV News two years later to be business editor.
She returned to the BBC last year in the role of Newsnight presenter.
She has lived and worked in France and in the US, covering two White House presidential races.
