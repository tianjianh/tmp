Hameed, 19, and 22-year old Duckett have both made their England debuts this winter in the subcontinent.
Donald is currently in Australia as part of the ECB's 'international pathway' scheme and has been tipped as a future England captain by former skipper Michael Vaughan.
"They have spurred me on, absolutely," Donald told BBC Radio Wales Sport.
"I came through the age groups with Has [Hameed] and have played a lot of winter cricket with him.
"The England set-up is affording young guys playing a certain style who have performed well a chance.
"There is Ben Duckett as well who forced his way in through weight of runs.
"It is a really great place to be in and an exciting England team at the minute across all formats.
"It is exciting to watch and a team you really want to be a part of."
Donald, who has been working with respected coach Neil Holder in Perth - who previously coached Australian Test batsman Justin Langer and Mike Hussey - says he wants to add consistency to his game next season.
The Glamorgan youngster reached 1000 first class runs and equalled the record for the fastest first class century in his breakthrough campaign of 2016.
"I was lucky to have the opportunities I did last year and I think I was the only guy to play in every match across every format all season," he said.
"Passing 1000 first class runs was a big moment and I had a great day up in Colwyn Bay with a big score.
"Hopefully I can kick on and keep impressing.
"Being more consistent in all formats is the aim and converting more starts into hundreds."
