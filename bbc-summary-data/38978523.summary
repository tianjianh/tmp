Cyclists Laura and Jason Kenny are expecting their first Baby

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Cycling superstar couple Laura and Jason Kenny have announced that they are expecting their first baby.

The couple and their families are said to be "absolutely thrilled and delighted with the news".
Jason Kenny and Laura Trott couple got married last September although Laura admitted to Newsround that it wasn't necessarily love at first sight.
Jason is the joint record holder (along with Sir Chris Hoy) of the most gold medals won by any British athlete. He's won six track Olympic gold medals, including three at last summer's Olympic games in Rio.
Laura is the first woman in British history to win four Olympic gold medals.
With those two as parents we'd say there's a pretty good chance their baby may become a star of the future!
