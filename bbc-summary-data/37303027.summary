The visitors, who rarely win qualifying games at this level, levelled at 43-43 with the first basket after half-time.
It took a run of seven points in the last 36 seconds of the third quarter to break the game open for GB.
Kyle Johnson scored 14 points for the hosts and Andrew Lawrence and Gabe Olaseni added 13 and 12 respectively.
"There were a lot of defensive errors in the first half, trying to do things a little differently that weren't really working for us," said GB's Gareth Murray. "We changed things at half-time and came out with a bit more intensity."
The hosts struggled to contain Luxembourg's Alex Laurent, who scored 21 of his 30 points in the first half.
It was only the late run in the third quarter, inspired by Johnson - one of four remaining 2012 Olympians - that gave coach Joe Prunty's team a comfortable cushion.
"I felt good that I was able to help the team win," said Johnson. "We were a bit sluggish in the first half and tried to bring some energy to the second half."
GB's win means they could move top of Group G on Saturday, when they entertain unbeaten leaders Hungary, with only the winners guaranteed to qualify for next year's finals.
GB finish their programme with games in Macedonia and Luxembourg next week.
