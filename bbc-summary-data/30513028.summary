The Hereford and Limousin-cross cattle, worth about Â£15,000, were taken from a farmer's field in Cambridge Road, Stretham on 6 December.
Cambridgeshire Police warned that cheap beef from an unusual source "may also carry health risks".
It was "an unusual crime for the area," a spokesman said.
The loss of the cattle has had "a massive effect on the victim and their livelihood", he added.
