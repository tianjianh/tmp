Forty one beaches have the flag, up seven on last year, and another 30 won green coast awards which recognises beaches with unspoiled environments.
Pembrokeshire topped the list picking up 11 flags and 12 coast awards while Swansea claimed the only blue flag for a marina.
Seaside awards for good water quality were given to 60 beaches.
The blue flag award is issued by the Foundation for Environmental Education (FEE), which rates beaches on categories including safety, facilities, and environmental management, as well as water quality and runs in 48 countries around the world.
In Wales the awards are managed by environmental charity Keep Wales Tidy.
Natural Resources Minister Carl Sargeant said the awards show Welsh beaches "are amongst the world's best".
