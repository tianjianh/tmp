Eaves, 24, who was released by Bolton, and 21-year-old Shephard have both had previous loan spells with the Glovers.
The League Two club have agreed a one-year deal with Eaves, who played seven times for them in 2014-15.
Shephard rejoins on a six-month loan from Swansea City after temporary stints in each of the last two seasons.
Liverpool-born Eaves joined Bolton from Oldham in August 2010 but made only five first-team appearances for the Trotters in his near six-year stay at the club.
"The club have been tracking Tom for a long time now and we're very pleased to have the option to take him on a permanent deal," Glovers boss Darren Way told the club's official website.
Welshman Shephard, who made his debut for the Swans in last season's FA Cup third round tie at Oxford United, first joined Yeovil for the final four months of the 2014-15 season, playing 20 times before returning for a month in March last term.
Eaves and Shephard join Otis Khan as new recruits for the forthcoming campaign.
