Retired police officer Trevor Bryer, 72, had a two-hour wait before he was taken to Prince Philip Hospital in Llanelli where he died two days later.
The ambulance came from Haverfordwest, Pembrokeshire, about an hour away.
His wife, Karen Bryer said: "If I had the strength I could've carried him on my back."
Mrs Bryer called the emergency service after her husband suffered a stroke at their home in Nantbryn, which backs on to the hospital's grounds.
She says she made two more emergency calls, about 25 minutes apart, as she waited for help.
She said: "It was the worst night of my life.
"But I thought the best thing to do was to let the ambulance crew see him first. But we waited and waited.
"How is it that this ambulance took almost two hours to arrive?"
The Welsh Ambulance Service NHS Trust has sent its condolences to the family and has confirmed an inquiry is under way.
Director of service delivery, Mike Collins, said: "We extend our deepest condolences to the patient's family at this difficult time.
"We have received a formal concern in relation to this and investigations are under way.
"We are liaising with the patient's family directly and it would be inappropriate to comment further."
