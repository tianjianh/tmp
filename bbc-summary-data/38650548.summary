Channel 4 paid an undisclosed amount for a minority stake in the Glasgow-based indie.
Firecrest was founded by former BBC producer Nicole Kleeman in 2008.
It initially focused on current affairs but has since expanded into features, documentary and specialist factual programmes.
Past production credits include The Secret Life Of Your Clothes for BBC Two and a number of films for BBC One's Panorama and Channel 4's Dispatches.
The indie's Supershoppers series for Channel 4 won both Bafta Scotland and Royal Television Society Scotland awards for the best feature and factual entertainment programme.
Firecrest is currently in production with four series and three single films for the BBC and Channel 4.
Channel 4's investment in Firecrest came via its Indie Growth Fund, which was set up in 2014 to help UK-based smaller independent companies develop their business.
Channel 4 chief executive David Abraham said: "Investing in an impressive Scottish producer such as Nicole builds on Channel 4's ongoing commitment to develop a UK-wide creative industry with a focus on growing businesses outside of London to ensure TV better reflects the stories and lives of people right across the UK."
Ms Kleeman, who spent 10 years at the BBC as a producer on programmes such as Panorama, Newsnight and The Culture Show, said: "It has been incredibly rewarding getting Firecrest to this stage but it's now time to take the company to the next level.
"This is an exciting time for Scotland's booming indie sector and with Channel 4's investment I'm looking forward to hiring a new creative team to increase our output and, in turn, scale a significant factual TV business in Glasgow which will hopefully bring more opportunities to a new generation of Scottish production talent."
