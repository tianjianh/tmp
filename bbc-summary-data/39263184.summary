[SN]TITLE[SN]
Forest Green Rovers 2-1 Solihull Moors

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Forest Green Rovers moved three points clear at the top of the National League thanks to Christian Doidge's last-gasp winner against Solihull Moors.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
With promotion rivals Lincoln slipping to second with defeat at Boreham Wood, Rovers took full advantage.
Fabien Robert had slotted the hosts ahead before Oladapo Afolayan's second-half equaliser looked to have earned Moors a share of the points.
But Doidge's low stoppage-time finish snatched Rovers a vital victory.
Mark Cooper's side - who travel to Lincoln on Saturday - have played three games more than the Imps, but have won seven of their past nine league games.
But for Doidge netting for a sixth consecutive game and taking his tally to 22 for the season, Rovers would have been left frustrated by a Solihull Moors side inspired by former Loughborough University forward Afolayan.
The Moors front man's pace caused the hosts problems on the counter-attack and he levelled when he skipped past keeper Sam Russell to fire in his third goal since signing in February.
Forest Green had started brightly but Robert's early flicked header was acrobatically saved, before the Frenchman's placed finish eventually opened the scoring shortly before the break.
Either side could have led before Doidge's dramatic late goal, as Kaiyne Woolery headed onto the bar for Rovers after Afolayan clipped the post.
