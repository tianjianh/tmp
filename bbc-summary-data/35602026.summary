The 21-year-old Waunarlwydd RFC product has made 10 appearances for the Swansea-based region this season.
With Scott Baldwin on international duty, he is likely to figure in more games during the next month.
"To put the jersey on is special and hopefully I'm going to get some game time over the next weeks while the internationals are away," he said.
