A charity box in the shape of a life-size golden retriever and two puppies has been stolen from outside a shop in Dorset.

The box, which had been chained up, was used to collect donations for the Guide Dogs For The Blind Association.
It is unclear how much money was inside when it was taken from the Pug and Puffin Gift Shop in Broad Street, Lyme Regis, sometime between Sunday night and Monday morning.
Police said it was a "despicable act".
PC Sean Cannon added: "We don't know the motive for the theft, so if the box was taken as a prank, we would ask those responsible to hand the box in to police."
