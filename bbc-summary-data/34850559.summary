The Shaymen lie bottom of the National League, 10 points adrift of Boreham Wood in 20th, following a 6-3 defeat by Braintree on Saturday.
Former Oldham Athletic manager Kelly, 36, was appointed at Halifax on 1 October and won two of his 10 games in charge in all competitions.
A club statement said a further announcement would follow shortly.
"Notwithstanding a backdrop of difficult circumstances and a short time period, it's been felt that an up-lift in performance and results has not been forthcoming - despite further first-team investment," the statement added.
Kelly's only previous managerial role was at Oldham, but he was replaced by David Dunn in September after just over four months - and nine games - in charge at Boundary Park.
Halifax conceded 37 goals in 10 games under Kelly, including seven against both Grimsby and Cheltenham.
