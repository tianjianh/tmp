[SN]TITLE[SN]
Justin Langer to coach Australia in Caribbean one-day series

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Former Australia batsman Justin Langer will take temporary charge of the one-day team for next year's triangular series in the Caribbean.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Coach Darren Lehmann will sit out matches against South Africa and West Indies from 6-26 June.
The 45-year-old will resume control for July's tour of Sri Lanka.
Ex-Australia assistant coach Langer, also 45, coaches Western Australia, and Lehmann has said he believes his former team-mate will succeed him.
It is the third time Australia have appointed an acting coach during Lehmann's reign.
Steve Rixon led the one-day side in India in 2013 and current England coach Trevor Bayliss was put in charge for the Twenty20 series against South Africa last year.
