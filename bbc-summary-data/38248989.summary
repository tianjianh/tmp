Laura Mvula, and Gareth Malone and the Invictus Choir, will also sing during the show to a star-studded audience and millions watching on BBC One.
This year's event is at the Genting Arena in Birmingham from 18:40 GMT.
Williams will provide the soundtrack to a special moment in the programme which celebrates the achievements of British Olympians and Paralympians at Rio 2016.
"I'm honoured to perform in such an iconic BBC programme," he said.
"It's been a truly amazing year for sport and I can't wait to take to the stage in Birmingham in front of such sporting heroes."
Birmingham's own Mvula, whose album The Dreaming Room was nominated for this year's Mercury Prize, will perform the show's opening number.
Choirmaster Gareth Malone will be joined by the Invictus Choir, made up of wounded ex-armed services personnel, in a moment dedicated to remembering those sporting icons that have died this year.
The BBC Concert Orchestra will provide the musical score to the programme throughout the evening.
A shortlist of 16 contenders has been named for the main Sports Personality award.
The last remaining tickets for the event are on sale now.
