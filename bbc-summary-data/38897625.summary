Lawrence Vigouroux: Swindon Town goalkeeper has red card overturned

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The red card shown to Swindon Town goalkeeper Lawrence Vigouroux during Sunday's loss to Oxford United has been rescinded by the Football Association.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 23-year-old was dismissed late on as the hosts lost 2-1 to their local rivals in League One.
He was originally deemed to have fouled Oxford's Kane Hemmings.
Former Liverpool and Hyde keeper Vigouroux will now be eligible for Saturday's league trip to the Robins' fellow strugglers, Bury.
