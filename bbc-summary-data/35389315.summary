[SN]TITLE[SN]
Blackpool 1-0 Gillingham

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Gillingham missed the opportunity to go top of League One as Jack Redshaw's penalty earned Blackpool victory.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
With Burton losing 2-1 at Rochdale the Gils would have gone top, but instead Redshaw moved Blackpool five points clear of the relegation zone.
The only goal came when Mark Yeates was fouled by Max Ehmer in the area and Redshaw slotted home from the spot.
Tom Aldred cleared an Ehmer strike off the line as Blackpool held on to record a third consecutive home clean sheet.
The result means Gillingham stay second, three points behind Burton, while Blackpool move up to 18th.
