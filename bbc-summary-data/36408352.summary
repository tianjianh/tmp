[SN]TITLE[SN]
Andy Council 'dinosaur' mural repainted on Bristol pub

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A mural on the side of a Bristol pub - which was painted over by workmen - has been replaced with a new work.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The painting, on a wall of The Oxford pub in Totterdown, was one of street artist Andy Council's pieces inspired by dinosaurs.
When it was painted over, regulars from the pub began a crowd-funding campaign to have it repainted.
Mr Council is spending the weekend adding new designs to the pub's walls.
"When I heard it had been painted over I thought it was funny because it was an accident and you do come to expect it," he said.
Mr Council has also painted murals at the Chelsea and Westminster Hospital and has a model in the Bristol M Shed museum.
