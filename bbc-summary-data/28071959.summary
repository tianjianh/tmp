[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The body of 50-year-old Nick Dewdney was found by police at a home in Eagle Drive in Colindale, north-west London, on 21 June.
He had been arrested on 30 April but was not charged. He was bailed to return on 17 November.
A Scout Association spokesman said he was suspended from the Scout movement.
"The Scout Association has co-operated fully with the statutory agencies during this case," the spokesman said.
"We carry out stringent vetting of all adults who work with young people. We require our volunteers to work to a strict code of practice outlined in the Young People First Code of Practice."
A Scotland Yard spokesman said they went to the address where they found Mr Dewdney's body "following concerns for the safety of the occupant".
"Officers forced entry and the body of a man, aged 50, was found at the scene. The death is not being treated as suspicious."
The Met's Directorate of Professional Standards has been informed of the death.
