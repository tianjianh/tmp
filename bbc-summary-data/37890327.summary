[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A 44-year-old man has died in custody at Maghaberry Prison, County Antrim.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
It is understood the man was Gerard Mulligan, from Lisburn, County Antrim, and that he took his own life at the high security jail on Saturday evening.
Mr Mulligan had been on remand charged with murdering his father, Gerald Mulligan, at his home in Limehurst Way, Lisburn, in September.
The PSNI, coroner and Prisoner Ombudsman have launched investigations into the prisoner's death.
The Northern Ireland Prison Service has not confirmed the inmate's identity or released any details about how he died, but said the man's next of kin have been informed.
Acting Prison Service director general Phil Wragg said: "I would like to extend my sympathy and that of the Northern Ireland Prison Service to the family of the prisoner who has died in Maghaberry.
"My thoughts are with them at this difficult time."
The prisoner's father was found dead in the boot of a car near his home on 26 September and he was arrested shortly afterwards.
