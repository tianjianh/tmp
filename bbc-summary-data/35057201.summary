Controversial plans for a waste processing plant have been approved.

Caerphilly council's planning committee gave the go-ahead to the development at Nine Mile Point Industrial Estate on Wednesday evening.
Cwmfelinfach residents objected to the plant on the grounds of a weather phenomenon called temperature inversion.
A report for applicants Hazrem Environmental said the site would have a "negligible" impact on air quality.
People living in the area feared the weather event, which causes warm air above the valley to trap cold air beneath it, would have kept emissions and fumes from the plant in the area for days before dispersing.
The plant will turn household, commercial and industrial waste, which may normally go to landfill, into bales of fuel.
