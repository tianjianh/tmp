[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
MSPs are to take evidence from business leaders and economists about the impact of the Brexit vote on Scotland.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Holyrood's European and external relations committee is holding special meetings during the summer parliamentary recess.
Universities Scotland, Virgin Money, the Scotch Whisky Association and the Scottish Trades Union Congress will all take part in a meeting on Thursday.
Committee members travelled to Brussels on a fact-finding trip earlier in July.
Convener Joan McAlpine said the formal evidence session on 28 July would seek to establish "what leaving the EU means to people in Scotland".
She said: "We know already from speaking to the British Chamber of Commerce in Brussels that access to the single market is of paramount importance to most companies.
"We experienced a lot of goodwill and understanding of Scotland's situation when we visited Brussels. No country has left the EU before and the process for leaving is far from straightforward, so it's important that our committee provides a forum for people in Scotland to get involved in this difficult process."
Other witnesses include Edinburgh Airport, Scottish Enterprise, the Federation of Small Businesses and representatives from the National Farmers Union and the Scottish Fishermen's Federation.
