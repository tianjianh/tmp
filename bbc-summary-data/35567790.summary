Harriers led 2-0 at the break after Arthur Gnahoua's opener was quickly followed by Harry White's penalty for a handball decision against Ryan Lloyd.
But Chester top scorer Ross Hannah got one back from the spot on 66 minutes after being fouled by Kelvin Langmead.
Substitute James Alabi then turned inside the box to blast home a stunning 76th-minute right-foot equaliser.
Both sides had chances to win it, as Hannah screwed wide before Tyrone Williams was then denied by a superb low late fingertip save by Chester keeper Tony Thompson.
Harriers, whop have lost just once in five games, remain second from bottom, nine points adrift of safety.
Chester, who move seven points clear of trouble, picked up their fourth point on the road in five days, having previously gone four months without an away league win.
Chester's comeback was the second season running they have come back from 2-0 down to draw 2-2 at Aggborough.
Last term's early season encounter marked City boss Steve Burr's first visit back to his old club. The visitors also quickly went two down that day, only to fight back to draw 2-2, despite the setback of Chris Iwelumo missing an early second-half penalty.
Chester manager Steve Burr told BBC Radio Merseyside:

"I was looking for us to kick on after winning at Altrincham on Tuesday and I think my lads thought they'd just turn up and put one over them.
"But Kiddy are in good form, playing with a lot of confidence and it took us 45 minutes to get into gear. In the end, we put a lot of determination and effort into a game that looked lost and could have won it, but then so could they, but for a great save by Tony Thompson at the end.
"It was great for James Alabi to score a goal like that right in front of all our away fans. It's been frustrating, as he picked up a groin injury a week after coming and we've been trying to get him out there, but he showed what he's capable of."
Harriers boss Colin Gordon told BBC Hereford & Worcester:
"We got very tired and leggy and were unable to keep the tempo going that we had in the first half. That's to be expected in a young team.
"But we kept going and finished the game with corners and shots. It was our intent to go and win, not just sit back and take a 2-2. That shows our intent.
"The referee maybe felt it was harsh with our penalty, although it did come up and hit his hand, so he has evened it up, but two wrongs don't make a right for me. It was a baffling decision. If that's a penalty then there are going to be a thousand a week."
