[SN]TITLE[SN]
FC Vaduz 3-0 Bala Town (Agg: 5-1)

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Bala exited the Europa League in the first qualifying round in Liechtenstein at the hands of FC Vaduz.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Welsh club trailed 2-1 after the first leg, but the contest was really over before half-time in the second-leg with the home side 3-0 ahead.
Striker Aldin Turkes scored twice whilst Marco Mathays netted controversially as the visitors were trying to make a substitution.
A goalless second period means the European dream is over for Bala.
