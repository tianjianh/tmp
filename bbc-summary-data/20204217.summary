A charity for abuse victims will use donated copies of an erotic bestseller as compost and toilet paper, it said.

Clare Phillipson, of Wearside Women in Need, originally asked people to donate their copy of Fifty Shades of Grey to be burned on 5 November in a bonfire.
She said the themes of sadism and masochism were "vile". The charity received about 24 copies and said they will now be cut up and recycled.
Publisher Random House said: "The sex scenes are entirely consensual."
The books are about a steamy romance between a businessman and a student.
The charity, based in Washington, originally planned to burn the donated books on a bonfire.
Ms Phillipson said: "There were a range options.
"We discussed the book burning while getting the message across that this book is a dangerous trend.
"I think we've got a culture now which has completely sexualised women and in which women feel obligated to take part in that culture. We want to draw a line under that.
"We will be cutting them up, using them for toilet roll and sticking them on our compost heap and they will go back into the ground... although the ideas they represent will continue."
Ms Phillipson said in August that money used to buy the book would be better spent supporting victims.
