Technology plays a key role in teenage romance from initial encounters to eventual break-ups, says a US study.

Teenagers rarely meet online but do use technology for flirting, asking out, meeting up and parting, American think tank, the Pew Research Center, found.
A survey of 1,060 US teenagers aged 13 to 17 revealed that technology brings them closer but also breeds jealousy.
"Digital platforms are powerful tools for teens," said Amanda Lenhart, lead author of the report from Pew.
"But even as teens enjoy greater closeness with partners and a chance to display their relationships for others to see, mobile and social media can also be tools for jealousy, meddling and even troubling behaviour."
Of the 1,060 teenagers surveyed:
What gets discussed during all those frequent social media enabled check-ins?
According to the survey, it is mostly "funny stuff" followed by "things you're thinking about" as well as other information such as where they are and what their friends have been doing.
And forget having to meet up to resolve a conflict - 48% of dating teenagers said that could be done by texting or talking online.
Online tools, with their accessibility and ease of use, also showed some signs of giving this group relationship anxiety.
Females are more likely to be subject to unwanted flirting and 25% of teenagers surveyed said they have blocked or unfriended someone because of uncomfortable flirting.
And 15% of teenage daters said a partner had used the internet to pressure them into unwanted sexual activity.
Nearly half the respondents admitted to concentrating on their phone ahead of their partner when together with 43% of dating teens saying that had happened to them.
"I don't think this survey reveals much that is surprising. But it is affirming. Humans are social animals and we build tools to connect with each other," wrote Julie Beck, an associate editor at The Atlantic news site, of the survey's findings.
"It's not all heart emojis all the time, no, but the tools that facilitate relationships facilitate all aspects of them, good and bad.
"Connecting with others is scary, hard, sometimes dangerous, but usually, hopefully, good. The teens get it."
