The new Aberystwyth fire station will be built on the same site as the current one on Penparcau Road, Trefechan.
Mid and West Wales Fire and Rescue Service said it would take about 10 months to finish.
Work began on Monday with demolition set to start later this week. Firefighters are being temporarily housed in the town's TA Centre.
