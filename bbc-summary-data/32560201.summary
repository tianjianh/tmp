The family of former Derry City striker Mark Farren are appealing for financial help after he recently underwent a third brain tumour operation.

Farren's family want to raise around £25,000 which would enable him to travel to a cancer centre in Germany.
In his most recent operation, surgeons removed over 80% of Farren's tumour but the 33-year-old's speech and mobility have been affected.
A biopsy after the surgery indicated that the tumour was highly aggressive.
The ex-Derry City striker turned 33 on Friday and a statement from his family said his former team-mates Kevin McHugh, Ruaidhri Higgins and Ciaran Martyn would be leading a number of fund-raising activities in the coming weeks.
"The six-week treatment programme is his best chance of saving or at least prolonging his life," added the Farren family's statement.
"Treatment will cost approximately €30,000. This is the one goal with which Mark needs our help, any contribution is greatly appreciated."
On Friday night, Farren's former Derry City team-mate and current Republic of Ireland international James McClean was reported to have pledged £1,000 for the fund.
Donegal man Farren was named the League of Ireland players' player of the year in 2005 and went on to become Derry's record goal-scorer in 2012 before joining Glenavon in 2013.
He was initially diagnosed with a benign brain tumour in December 2008 but continued to play on for Derry City until October 2009.
After undergoing surgery, Farren returned to Derry City colours in the summer of the 2011 and broke the club's scoring record a year later shortly before signing for Glenavon.
Farren was named the Irish League's player of the month in April 2013 but had to stop playing later that year in order to undergo more surgery.
