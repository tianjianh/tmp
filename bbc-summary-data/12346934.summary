[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Twenty firefighters were called to the warehouse-style Copdock Country Store in Old London Road, Copdock, at 0130 GMT.
The fire took hold in the office area and took two hours to extinguish.
Owner Mark Gladwell said a 22-stone (140kg) safe was taken and a corner of the building had been destroyed.
"All the records, computers have gone," he added.
"It's going to take a few weeks to get trading again from this part of the building."
