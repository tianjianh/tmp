An updated yellow "be aware" warning was issued by forecasters from 11:00 BST on Friday to 09:00 BST on Saturday.
The Met Office said rain and showers will spread north through Wales on Friday evening into Saturday.
While many places will miss heavier rain, there could still be "significant disruption" in some places.
Forecasters said in addition to localised surface water flooding, lightning and hail could cause problems.
Some thunderstorms could see 20-30mm (0.8-1.2in) of rain falling in an hour, with heavier persistent rain of  up to 40mm (1.6in) in some parts of south Wales.
No incidents have been reported so far in Wales on Friday.
