Yeovil new school costs go up by £1.6m

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An extra £1.6m has been put aside by Somerset County Council to pay for a new school in Yeovil.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The building was originally estimated to cost £5m to build but due to "significant inflation in the construction industry" over the past 18 months more money is needed.
The primary school is set to be built near the Wyndham Park estate where new homes are being built.
County councillors approved the extra funding at a meeting on Monday.
