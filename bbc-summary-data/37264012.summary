[SN]TITLE[SN]
Dover Athletic 4-3 Forest Green Rovers

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Ricky Miller scored a superb hat-trick as Dover made it two wins on the bounce with a thrilling victory over National League leaders Forest Green.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Rovers made a positive start and took the lead in the seventh minute thanks to Liam Noble's deflected free-kick, but the hosts were soon back on level terms.
Miller was in the right place to convert a cross from Aswad Thomas, and the striker added a second early in the second half with a coolly-taken penalty.
The see-saw nature of the contest continued as Rovers equalised through Rhys Murphy before Ross Lafayette restored Dover's advantage with a smart finish in the 68th minute.
Christian Doidge looked to have rescued a point for the visitors in the 85th minute, but there was still time for Miller to complete his treble and clinch victory with a fine strike.
