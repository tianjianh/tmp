[SN]TITLE[SN]
Coventry City 1-2 Milton Keynes Dons

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A brace from Ed Upson saw MK Dons grab their first League One win in almost two months at 10-man Coventry.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Sky Blues dominated the first half and had a series of chances to grab the opening goal.
Ben Stevenson steered a ninth-minute effort just wide, while a 14th-minute effort by Gael Bigirimana sailed inches over the bar after some good link-up play with Marcus Tudgay.
There was a lack of quality in the final third, up until the 34th minute when Upson headed a Dean Lewington cross into the far corner past a hapless Lee Burge.
Stevenson's stunning 30-yard strike in the 38th minute ensured the Dons' lead was short-lived after he pounced on a poor clearance by goalkeeper Dave Martin.
Stevenson turned from hero to villain in the 73rd minute after being sent off for a high challenge on Lewington.
The Dons made their advantage count in the 81st minute, when Upson fired home from six yards after Coventry failed to clear the ball.
