[SN]TITLE[SN]

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A teacher who took a pupil on a fake school trip, sent her excessive emails and let her stay overnight at her house has been banned from teaching.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Clare Griffiths, 48, took the pupil and another on a bogus school trip to Alton Towers, a hearing was told.
The former teacher at Harper Green Secondary School in Farnworth, Bolton, also disclosed confidential information to one of the pupils.
The disciplinary panel deemed her behaviour was "unacceptable".
The National College for Teaching and Leadership (NCTL) said her conduct also "brought the profession into disrepute".
Mrs Griffiths, from Greater Manchester, was not present at the hearing but admitted "failure to maintain boundaries" by sending excessive emails to the girl known as Pupil A - including messages late at night - as well as letting her stay at her house when she had left school in September and October 2014.
The hearing was told the mother of Pupil A said she was aware she was staying there and had "no concerns" about it.
Her uncle raised concerns with the school about their relationship in October 2014.
The panel also found Mrs Griffiths was "deliberately dishonest" in misleading the two pupils (known as Pupil A and Pupil C) into believing the theme park trip was an official school trip.
The NCTL said: "Mrs Griffiths must have known that what she was doing was dishonest as she asked Pupil A and Pupil C's parents to sign consent letters knowing that the trip had not been authorised by the school."
It ruled the teacher breached the school's data protection policies by providing confidential information to Pupil A, sending her a detailed contact list of the incoming year six pupils.
Mrs Griffiths joined Harper Green as a newly qualified teacher in 2009.
She has 28 days to appeal and can apply to have the prohibition order set aside in two years.
