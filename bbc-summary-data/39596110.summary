Derry City eye Oriel Park for Europa League games

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Derry City hope to use Oriel Park in Dundalk as their home venue in the Europa League while the Brandywell is redeveloped.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
City play their League of Ireland matches at Maginn Park in Buncrana but it does not meet Uefa standards.
Oriel Park, home to league champions Dundalk, could host the Candystripes in the qualifier rounds this summer.
It's been reported that the Showgrounds in Sligo was Derry's preferred option but it was financially unviable.
