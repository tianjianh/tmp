Tottenham have completed the signing of Burnley right-back Kieran Trippier on a five-year-deal.

The 24-year-old moves to Spurs for an undisclosed fee from the Clarets, who he joined in 2012.
The former Manchester City trainee made 185 appearances for Burnley, and started every Premier League game last season.
"When I first heard that the club was interested I didn't have to think twice," Trippier said.
"It's such a big club and now I just can't wait to get started and show everyone what I can do."
Trippier becomes Mauricio Pochettino's second signing of the summer after Spurs signed Cologne defender Kevin Wimmer for an undisclosed fee on a five-year deal.
Trippier added: "I'll take every opportunity I get with both hands and hopefully play my part for everyone at the club.
"Whenever I get a chance, I want to do well for the other players, the staff and, of course, the fans."
Trippier did not make a first-team appearance for Manchester City, and had a loan spell at Barnsley before moving to Turf Moor, initially on loan.
