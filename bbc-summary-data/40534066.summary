The 15-year-old is said to be making "good progress" having suffered serious hand and leg injuries in the blast, her parents said.
Laura, from Barra, in the Outer Hebrides, was at the Ariana Grande concert with friend Eilidh MacLeod.
Eilidh was one of people killed in the attack at Manchester Arena.
Michael and Nan MacIntyre said their daughter, a pupil at Castlebay Community School, is now one step closer to home.
They thanked people in Manchester for their help, particularly a man who stayed with Laura in the aftermath of the bombing.
In a statement, Laura's parents said: "We'd like to take this opportunity to thank the people of Manchester and in particular all those who have done so much to help Laura and our family.
"The kindness and care started from the first moments after the bombing when a young travel safe officer held Laura's hand and comforted her for an hour while she waited for treatment.
"We believe he helped save Laura's life that night and he will always be a hero to our family.
"Since then, he has been to visit Laura in hospital and it was a privilege to meet him and thank him in person."
The family also thanked medical staff at the Royal Manchester Children's Hospital.
"We couldn't wish for a more dedicated, kind and professional group of people," the family said.
"We'd also like to thank Greater Manchester Police and Police Scotland for their support.
"Loganair Glasgow and Dolina at the airport in Barra have also been fantastic, helping fly family members to and from Manchester.
"We'd also like to thank Ronald McDonald House for providing accommodation during our time in the city. Finally, we'd like to thank Michael's employers, Marine Harvest, for their patience and help.
"All these people and organisations have made a big difference during a very traumatic time and we will always be grateful.
"Laura continues to make good progress in her recovery but it will be a long process. Her hand and leg injuries are significant but we are glad that she has been able to move to Glasgow.
"She is now one step closer to eventually returning home to Barra, from where we have received enormous love and support."
