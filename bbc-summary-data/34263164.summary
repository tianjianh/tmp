A woman accused of paying for a yacht used in a plot to smuggle more than £150m of drugs into the UK has told a court she was unaware her husband wanted the vessel to import cocaine.

Dawne Powell, 56, from Guiseley, West Yorkshire, told Leeds Crown Court she was not involved in the smuggling plot.
She said she believed the boat - the Makayabella - had been bought with her husband Stephen's poker winnings.
Stephen Powell, 48, has already been jailed over the importation plot.
The court heard a total of 1,025 2.2lb (1kg) blocks of high-purity cocaine contained in 41 packages, with a street value of around £164m, was found on board the Makayabella.
The vessel was seized by the Irish Navy on 23 September last year, the jury was told.
It had been bought in the Caribbean and used to bring the drugs across the Atlantic Ocean from Venezuela.
The yacht was found in poor condition in the Atlantic Ocean, 200 miles (322km) off the south-west coast of Ireland, while investigators also seized a motor boat called Sea Breeze, moored in Pwllheli, north Wales.
Stephen Powell bought the £100,000 Makayabella in his name, but it was paid for in four instalments from a bank account in the sole name of his wife, the court heard.
The court heard that the Sea Breeze was bought by Stephen Powell but the cash payment of £18,350 was made by his wife.
Prosecutor Mark McKone said she was "in it together" with her husband.
Ms Powell is on trial with James Hill, 30, from Ilkley, West Yorkshire.
Both deny a charge of conspiracy to import cocaine.
Ms Powell also denies a charge of money laundering.
Stephen Powell, John Powell, Benjamin Mellor, Thomas Britteon, David Webster and Philip McElhone have all pleaded guilty to conspiracy to import cocaine, the court has heard.
The trial continues.
