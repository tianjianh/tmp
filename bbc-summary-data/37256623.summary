[SN]TITLE[SN]
Teacher Ronald Burton jailed for sex abuse of former pupils

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A teacher who sexually abused two pupils at South Lanarkshire secondary schools has been jailed for six years.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Ronald Burton was convicted of lewd and libidinous behaviour towards one boy, who was aged between 11 and 13, from 1994 until 1996.
The 60-year-old, from East Kilbride, was also convicted of sexually assaulting a 13-year-old boy in 2014.
At the High Court in Glasgow, a judge told now-retired Burton that he had acted "disgracefully" towards the boys.
Lady Stacey told him: "You abused the trust that the children had in you."
Burton, who maintains his innocence, showed no emotion as he was led handcuffed to the cells.
His lawyer said he had been a "gifted" teacher, but that his reputation now "lay in tatters".
The court was previously told that Burton had taught maths and had been an assistant principal teacher.
The jury heard that he got to know the first victim around 1994 when he was in first year and later went on to abuse him.
The abuse ended when the boy was around 15.
The victim told the court: "I ended up thinking I was the one in the wrong."
Burton later moved schools and eventually abused a second boy.
The teacher was reported to police after the first victim told he felt "worthless" and later confronted Burton.
In his closing speech, prosecutor Paul Kearney described Burton as "highly manipulative" in carrying out "systematic sexual abuse".
Burton had faced other charges including claims he raped the second victim and also tried to hypnotise him, but these were dropped by prosecutors.
