The 22-year-old spent the final two months of last season on loan at the Shrimps where he scored two goals in his seven appearances.
Stockport, who also had a stint on loan at Southport last season, came through the Rovers academy.
"Cole is another young player with bags of potential," manager Jim Bentley told the club website.
"He is a good finisher and works really hard and we hope to see him continue his development this season.''
