England one-day captain Eoin Morgan said no player will be forced to tour Bangladesh in the light of security concerns in the country.

The England and Wales Cricket Board sent representatives to Bangladesh to assess travel safety.
The squad will meet them on Thursday, before flying out on 30 September for two Tests and three one-day matches.
"I don't think anybody will ever be forced to go on a particular tour," Morgan told BBC Radio 5 live.
"I think it's important for us to get together as a group, and be informed by people who we trust in order to make the right decisions and go from there."
Australia previously postponed their Test tour to Bangladesh in October 2015 due to security concerns, while England have not toured in the country since 2010.
The ECB have been monitoring security in Bangladesh after 20 hostages and two police officers were killed in Dhaka in July.
"I'm pretty open-minded," Morgan added. "You can't really rule out anything until you hear from the people that you trust.
"The ECB have made decisions over the years that have held us in good stead - we've never been in any danger before."
