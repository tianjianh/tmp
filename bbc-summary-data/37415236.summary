[SN]TITLE[SN]
Bradford City 2-1 Fleetwood Town

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Third-placed Bradford City maintained their unbeaten start to the season - and ended a run of five successive draws - after coming behind to earn a win over Fleetwood Town at Valley Parade.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Bobby Grant put Fleetwood in front after 34 minutes, taking a pass from David Ball and cutting in from the right before beating keeper Colin Doyle with an angled shot high into the net.
The goal came after former Bradford striker Devante Cole had missed a great chance of scoring against his old club in the 14th minute.
Cole looked certain to score after intercepting a loose pass from Josh Cullen, but Doyle dived full length to turn his low shot away for a corner.
Bradford equalised in the second minute of stoppage time at the end of the first half, three minutes after visitors' keeper Chris Neal had made a fine save to stop Haris Vuckic's shot on the line.
However, Neal could nothing to prevent Filipe Morais' equaliser. The Portguese winger raced on to a pass from substitute Billy Clarke and scored with a rasping shot from 10 yards to leave the sides level 1-1 at half-time.
Bradford's winner came in the 62nd minute. Timothee Dieng was held by back in the penalty area by Amari'i Bell and Clarke scored from the spot.
