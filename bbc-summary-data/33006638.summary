University offers free online forensic investigation course

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Dundee University is to offer a free course allowing learners to step into the shoes of a forensic investigator.

The university's latest Massive Open Online Course is based on a story by crime author Val McDermid, concerning a mystery body found on a city hillside.
Through the six-week course users pick their way through the plot, solving mysteries presented through evidence and video footage to identify the body.
Anyone can sign up to the free course through the FutureLearn platform.
Filming for the course briefly sparked an alert after locals spotted police tape and people in uniform on the Law and thought there had been an actual incident.
Project manager Dr Helen Meadows said the course would give a "real insight" into the work of the university's Centre for Anatomy and Human Identification.
She said: "At CAHID we work on this kind of investigation all the time, helping police in criminal investigations and identifying bodies in all manner of different circumstances.
"What we are doing with this course is giving everyone a chance to get a taste of that. We know from the millions of people who watch programmes like "CSI" or read crime writers such as Val that there is an incredible level of interest in forensic sciences and their relationship to helping solve criminal cases or mysteries.
"This course will give a real insight into the work we do. It is also set at a level where people don't require any prior specialist knowledge and it is suitable for anyone from 14 to 114."
The course will start in September, and will be accessed entirely online. The story by Val McDermind which underpins it will also be available to download once the course is completed.
The course is the second MOOC launched by the university through FutureLearn, which reaches almost two million people in 190 countries around the world.
