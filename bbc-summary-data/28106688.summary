Kathy Wiles, who was due to stand in the 2015 Westminster election, said she wanted to highlight the dangers of using children in political campaigns.
Her initial tweet was responding to a picture showing children at the demo wearing pro-independence T-shirts.
Ms Wiles has apologised and resigned as a candidate for the seat of Angus.
The Labour Party said it would swiftly get a replacement.
Ms Wiles posted the contentious Nazi picture in relation to a social media debate about a protest outside BBC Scotland on Sunday afternoon about the corporation's coverage of the independence referendum.
She was responding to a photo from the protest which showed children standing underneath a promotional banner for pro-"Yes" blog Wings Over Scotland.
Replies to the tweet likened the photo to the Hitler Youth, to which Ms Wiles responded with an image showing children gathered around a swastika.
Ms Wiles was criticised by the father of two of the children in the protest photograph. He tweeted: "How dare you compare my children to the Hitler youth, despicable."
Ms Wiles apologised through her Twitter page @KathyWforAngus on Tuesday morning, writing: "I tweeted a picture on Sunday which has caused offence for which I apologise unequivocally.
"My intention was to make a point about the dangers of using young children in political campaigns, not to make any inference about those in the photo."
She has since deleted her account.
Scottish Labour later confirmed it had accepted Ms Wiles's resignation as a parliamentary candidate.
A party spokesman said: "We believe that Kathy Wiles has taken the right decision to withdraw in Angus and we will move swiftly to get another candidate in place.
"The debate about Scotland's future should be held in a respectful and positive way and we will take robust and immediate action if any of our members fall below these standards."
