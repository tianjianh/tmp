[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The leader of Yorkshire First has called for "tried and tested, first-rate devolution" for the county.

Richard Carter said the new political party, standing in its first general election, wanted a "real voice" for Yorkshire.
The party, set up in 2014, stood in the last EU elections gaining 19,017 votes.
It intends to stand in 13 seats across Yorkshire in the election. Mr Carter is to contest Dewsbury, currently held by Conservative Simon Reevell.
The party would influence the outcome in certain "ultra-marginal" seats, said Mr Carter.
He said if local government reform only led to a "glorified county council there is no point" but the party wanted devolution "similar to Scotland and Wales" and to establish a parliament for Yorkshire.
"We absolutely do not want independence, we want a stronger United Kingdom that works for all parts and regions," he added.
He was speaking on BBC Look North as part of a series of interviews with party leaders.
Mr Carter qualified as a teacher at Leeds University before setting up his own business and was previously a member of the Labour Party.
