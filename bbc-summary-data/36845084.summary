Family jailed for trafficking Hungarian women given slavery orders

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A family who trafficked and enslaved two Hungarian women to force them into prostitution has been given Slavery and Trafficking Prevention Orders (STPOs).

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Ferenc Dardai Sr, 43, Ferenc Dardai Jr, 23, and Melania Kiraly, 43, were jailed for sex trafficking offences at Bolton Crown Court in September.
A judge issued the orders after an application was made by Greater Manchester Police.
The orders prevent the family from any future contact with the sex industry.
Ferenc Dardai Jr was jailed for six years and his father Ferenc Dardai Sr was sentenced to four. His wife Kiraly was jailed for four years and four months.
Their victims were forced to see up to five clients a day and sometimes beaten for "not smiling enough", the court heard.
One woman, who had travelled to the UK from Hungary a year before, said she had been "treated like a slave".
The STPOs require the family, on release from prison, to report their addresses, details of mobile phones and bank accounts and casino registrations to police.
They are banned from advertising on adult websites or having anyone linked to the sex industry in their car or living with them.
They must not carry any more than Â£200 cash.
STPOs are civil orders created by the Modern Slavery Act 2015 and are designed to prevent anyone who has been convicted of a slavery or trafficking offence from committing any similar offences in future.
Judge Peter Davies, presiding at Carlisle Crown Court, imposed the orders on Tuesday. They remain in place until any further order is made.
Det Insp Neil Blackwood said: "These orders are vitally important, because they are ultimately about preventing dangerous men and women from harming further victims.
"These restrictions will allow Greater Manchester Police to ensure the Dardai family are unable to subject anyone else to the horrific treatment suffered by the two victims in this case."
