Willis, 26, won six matches last year to qualify before losing to seven-time champion Roger Federer on Centre Court in the second round.
Now ranked 387th in the world, he must win three matches to qualify.
Martin, the world number 146, beat top-15 player Lucas Pouille in straight sets at the 2016 French Open.
Willis will be second on Court 11 on Monday. If he beats Martin, 27, he could face fellow Briton Liam Broady in the next round.
Qualification runs from 26-29 June, with the main draw to be made on 30 June.
Willis has received a wildcard for the men's doubles at Wimbledon.
Seven Britons have been given wildcards for the singles: Naomi Broady, Heather Watson, Laura Robson, Katie Boulter in the women's draw, and Brydan Klein, Cameron Norrie and James Ward in the men's.
Wimbledon runs from 3-16 July.
