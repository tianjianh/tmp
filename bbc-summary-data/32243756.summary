Paramedics in Northern Ireland face an "enormous burden of stress", a trade union's survey suggests.

Unison said 96% of 248 ambulance workers questioned suffer from work-related stress.
It also said more than 80% of staff had considered leaving their jobs and that 71% suffered from sleep problems.
The Department of Health has said it will consider the report's findings to ensure front-line staff are given appropriate support.
In the report, one paramedic said hospital closures meant they had to drive hundreds of miles every day.
Unison regional organiser Nuala Conlon said pressure on emergency staff was reaching "dangerously high levels".
"The pressure on workers is mounting and the apparent lack of support from their employers means they are suffering in silence," she said.
"Year after year, the levels of stress remain unacceptably high and yet neither employers nor the government have done anything to address this."
In a statement, the Department of Health said: "The department looks to all health and social care organisations to ensure that staff working on the frontline are given appropriate support to carry out the vital services that they deliver to patients."
