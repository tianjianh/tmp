The footage, showing Simon McManus' son Toby, 12, being kicked and punched by a group of boys, was initially uploaded to social media app Snapchat.
Mr McManus copied the footage and shared it on Facebook, where it was viewed more than 2m times in two days.
Avon and Somerset Police said it was now investigating.
Mr McManus said several onlookers filmed the assault when Toby was set upon in the park in Yeovil, Somerset.
Mr McManus said he had been "overwhelmed" by the response from "everyone who watched it".
"Two million people watched my son being beaten by some youths who felt that just knocking him to the ground wasn't quite enough, they had to continue to kick and stamp on him whilst down on the ground in pain," he said.
He said he had received "hundreds and hundreds of messages of kindness" for Toby and thanked his family, friends, his son's school and the police.
"My son now has most of his confidence back that he lost when he was beaten and humiliated by these individuals," he said.
"He is able now, to walk with his head held high knowing that there are far more decent, genuine people out there who really do care than there are low-lifes."
Avon and Somerset Police has asked people not to share the video further on social media because of the ages of those involved.
"We have received an allegation of assault and we are investigating," a force spokesman said.
