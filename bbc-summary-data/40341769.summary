The 26-year-old, who had two previous loan spells at Deepdale, has agreed a three-year contract.
Rudd, who made 34 appearances for Norwich after his debut in 2009, played 40 times on loan at League One side Charlton Athletic last season.
"It should be an easy process for him to settle in," Preston boss Simon Grayson told the club website.
"He knows how we all work and it could be as if he has not been away. We are looking forward to working with him and looking forward to challenge he will provide."
