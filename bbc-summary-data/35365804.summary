[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Conalgen Enterprises SA want to demolish the former Rushden and Diamonds ground in Irthlingborough.
AFC Rushden and Diamonds, created in 2011 after Rushden and Diamonds went into administration, said the area was "in dire need" of sporting facilities.
The developers have been contacted by the BBC but refused to comment.
The company submitted an application to replace Nene Park with a four storey hotel, cinema, restaurants and a food store in December.
It includes a proposal to keep a football pitch to the far end of the site.
AFC Rushden and Diamonds vice chairman Jon Ward said: "There's no ancillary structures, no changing rooms and no stands.
"It would be useful for some Saturday morning and Sunday teams, but for a team playing at our level it wouldn't really be suitable."
The club, which has 36 teams playing in the area, has formally objected to the plan.
Nene Park, which has a capacity of 6,400, was opened by Sir Bobby Robson and was seen as one of the finest non-league football grounds before Rushden and Diamonds gained promotion to the Football league.
The stadium was developed throughout the 1990s using funds from club owner and Dr Martens tycoon Max Griggs.
However, in 2011 the club went into administration and supporters decided to create a phoenix club - and within a month AFC Rushden & Diamonds was born.
Kettering Town FC briefly moved into the stadium, but since 2012 it has been sitting empty.
The application for outline planning permission will be decided by East Northamptonshire Council.
