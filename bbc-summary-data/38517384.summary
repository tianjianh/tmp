The X-Men spin-off, starring Ryan Reynolds, is one of five films up for the guild's adapted screenplay prize.
Oscar-tipped titles La La Land and Moonlight are among those in contention for its original screenplay award.
Last year both Spotlight and The Big Short went on to win screenplay Oscars after being recognised by the WGA.
Deadpool's competition includes Denzel Washington's film version of August Wilson's stage play Fences.
In a statement, the actor and director said it was "a huge honour to shoulder the responsibility of Wilson's words being brought to the big screen".
Sci-fi film Arrival, Nasa-based drama Hidden Figures and Tom Ford's Nocturnal Animals are also up for the adapted screenplay honour.
La La Land and Moonlight are joined by Hell or High Water, Loving and Manchester by the Sea in the original screenplay category.
The WGA also awards a prize for documentary screenplay, with Author: The JT LeRoy Story - a film about a female author who purported to be a male prostitute - among the three nominees.
Guild rules dictate that a number of much-favoured awards contenders - among them Lion and animated film Zootropolis - are not eligible for its prizes.
The WGA's list of 2017 nominations also includes citations for TV programmes, among them Games of Thrones, Veep and The People vs OJ Simpson.
Deadpool is up for two awards at this weekend's Golden Globes, among them the prize for best film musical or comedy.
