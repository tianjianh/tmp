Juan Thompson, 31, "allegedly caused havoc, expending hundreds of hours of police and law enforcement resources", said NYPD Commissioner James P O'Neill.
He allegedly made eight threats against Jewish Community Centers (JCC), while claiming to be a former girlfriend, according to officials.
He was arrested in St Louis, Missouri, and will be in court later on Friday.
As well as his alleged threats against the JCCs in January and February this year, he is also accused of sending an emailed threat to the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) offices in New York City.
The email said his former girlfriend, referred to by the FBI as Victim-1, was behind the bomb threats. It added: "She lives in nyc and is making more bomb threats tomorrow."
The next day the office received a phone call claiming that explosive material had been placed inside the building.
In addition to making threats, he is accused of cyber-stalking Victim-1, which can carry a sentence of up to five years in jail.
The threats were made "as part of a sustained campaign to harass and intimidate" the woman, according to the FBI's press statement.
At least 100 phone threats have been made to Jewish institutions since the beginning of January, according to the JCC Association of North America.
Three Jewish cemeteries, including one near St Louis, have also faced vandalism attacks.
