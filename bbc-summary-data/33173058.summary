Labour leadership hopefuls in live TV clash

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Labour's leadership hopefuls have been grilled on the public finances, welfare and immigration in the first live television debate of the contest.

Andy Burnham, Yvette Cooper, Liz Kendall and Jeremy Corbyn went head to head in Nuneaton, a marginal seat Labour failed to win at the election.
One audience member asked them to compare themselves with "successful" SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon.
The new leader will be announced at a special conference on 12 September.
A series of live and televised hustings will be held over the coming weeks.
BBC political correspondent Iain Watson said the first debate was "incredibly important", especially as it took place in a seat Labour had hoped to win but "went backwards".
Mr Burnham the bookies' favourite, sought to cast himself as the candidate from outside the "Westminster bubble", and said: "Your accent shouldn't stop you getting anywhere."
When the shadow health secretary said the "party comes first", Ms Kendall interjected to say: "No, the country comes first."
Ms Kendall said she would be a candidate with no "baggage", and said Labour had not been trusted with the public finances.
Ms Cooper said she made no apology for having run a government department, while Mr Corbyn, the left-wing MP who narrowly made it onto the ballot just before the deadline, said people had had enough of "personality politics".
"They want something which is much more about movement politics," he added.
Asked to compare herself with Ms Sturgeon, Ms Cooper said it would be "fantastic to smash the final glass ceiling" and appoint a female leader. But she declined to endorse Ms Kendall if she was not successful just so Labour would have a woman in charge.
The often-hostile questioners included a fireman who turned to UKIP as a protest vote and a man who raised immigration concerns and told the candidates: "You live in a different world to me."
After a woman in the audience attacked the "sense of entitlement" of some welfare claimants, Ms Cooper revealed she had spent a year off work sick for a  20 years ago, relying on welfare, and "as a result, I would never say that people who can't work are workshy".
In the final question, the panel were asked if they should be replaced if they are in charge but Labour is looking like losing the 2020 general election.
Some in the party have called for it to be made easier for the leader to be replaced under such circumstances.
Ms Kendall said she agreed: "Because more than anything I want Labour to win so we can change the country".
Mr Corbyn said the leader should be re-elected regularly anyway, while Mr Burnham said "of course" Labour should be able to get rid of a failing leader. "I'm someone with my feet on the ground," he said. Ms Cooper says Labour already has rules to allow a leader change.
Ed Miliband's eventual replacement will be decided by a vote of Labour Party representatives, members and affiliates, to be conducted on a one-member, one-vote basis.
