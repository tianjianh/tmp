[SN]TITLE[SN]
Two men face trial over 'Easdale abuse' outside Ibrox

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Two men have appeared in court charged with threatening Rangers investors Sandy and James Easdale.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Barrie Donnelly, 37, from Uddingston, South Lanarkshire, and Mark Sweeten, 41, from Glasgow, deny making abusive and threatening remarks on 8 November.
It is alleged they targeted the McGills Buses owners as they entered Ibrox Stadium at Edmiston Drive.
Both men entered not guilty pleas during an appearance at Glasgow Sheriff Court and a trial was set for May 2015.
The charge alleges that both men behaved in way that was likely or would be likely to "incite public disorder" by shouting, swearing and making abusive and offensive remarks.
