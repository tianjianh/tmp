The incident was said to have happened as Mr Galloway gave a talk in the university's New King's building.
He tweeted that he had an "unknown substance in my eyes and lungs" but added later that he was "feeling better... just needed a good shower".
Police confirmed they had been called to a disturbance at 19:45.
Mr Galloway, who is from Dundee, also tweeted: "Someone calling themselves "Trans" and an "anarchist" led a five person attack on me on the platform at Aberdeen University. I continued."
He also said on Twitter that his pregnant wife had leapt forward to defend him.
A Police Scotland spokesman said officers had attended High Street in Old Aberdeen following reports of a disturbance.
"Inquiries are at an early stage and no further details are available at this  time," he said.
