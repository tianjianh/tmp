The 20 year old-man, who was with his partner at the time, was chased down Copland Road and on to Summertown Road at about 22:00 on Monday.
He was then seriously assaulted. His partner was unharmed.
Detectives said it was a "deliberate and targeted" attack and have urged anyone who witnessed a disturbance in the area to come forward.
The 20-year-old man was taken to the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital and left after treatment.
Both suspects were described as white men with local accents and slim builds, who were wearing dark clothing at the time of the incident.
They are aged between 20 and 30, with one man about 6ft tall and the other shorter.
Det Con Kris Elliott, Govan CID, said: "Both men were involved in the attack, however, we understand that only one of the men was in possession of a weapon at the time of the incident.
"We have been assessing CCTV images and conducting door-to-door inquiries to establish the identity of the men responsible."
"If anyone witnessed a disturbance on Monday evening around Summertown Road, please contact police with any information you have."
