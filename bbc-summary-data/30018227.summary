The post was also uploaded on to her sister's boyfriend, Scott Disick's account.
He added "And a Jew" referencing his own background.
It shows the three sisters smiling into the camera dressed in white, with the caption "The Only KKK To Ever Let Black Men In".
Khloe tweeted a link to the Instagram meme along with the word "true" - that still remains on Twitter but the link no longer works.
It's been reported that the meme has been doing the rounds online for a while and is in reference to the Ku Klux Klan.
The group has historically been known as a secretive racist society based mainly in the southern states of the USA. They opposed civil rights for African Americans.
It is also known for wearing white floor length robes and a white sharp pointy hood.
US Weekly said the star had "gone too far", while some fans called the post offensive. A senior digital editor at Ebony magazine called Khloe a "trash bag".
The meme also got a lot of likes and "lols" from fans of the stars.
