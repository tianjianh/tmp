Greater Manchester Police said the incident was one of 14 arrests made in connection with the game.
There were also reports of fans setting off fireworks on Greater Manchester's tram network.
The match at the Etihad finished 1-1 with City progressing to the knock-out stages and Celtic going out of Europe.
Superintendent Craig Thompson said the game passed "largely without incident".
About 30 people were ejected from the stadium - mostly away supporters for sitting in the home end.
