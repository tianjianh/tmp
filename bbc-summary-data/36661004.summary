The second leg of the Europa League first qualifying round tie will be played at Solitude next week.
Lavery's headed effort ensures that Gerard Lyttle's side take a crucial away goal into that game.
New Reds goalkeeper Jason Mooney saved from Yeye Jordann early on but Omar Er Rafik found the net in the 38th minute.
After the break, home keeper Julien Weber made a fine stop from Martin Donnelly.
Cliftonville secured their place in the competition by winning the first-ever Irish League Europa League qualifier, with a dramatic 3-2 victory over Glentoran in May.
Lyttle had to plan without suspended defender Jaimie McGovern but Jason McGuinness started his first competitive fixture for the north Belfast outfit following his move from St Patrick's Athletic.
Cliftonville manager Gerard Lyttle: "The aim was to come here and at least get a goal and we worked very hard against a team we knew very little about.
"We sussed them out well in the first half and were a different team in the second half. We had a wee go at them and all the boys were first class.
"Ross came through our youth system and I am delighted for him. Tonight is a dream come true for him and he has lots of talent, ability, energy and strength."
