All 1,500 students at a college campus in Swansea have been evacuated following a chemicals alert.

Pupils were asked to leave Gower College's Gorseinon campus following updated advice about the storage of a chemical there.
College principal Mark Jones confirmed there was no spillage and no-one was injured. The chemical is in a laboratory store.
An unrelated fire at the Tycoch campus means it is closed until 7 November.
The Gorseinon campus has now been evacuated as well, with the incident described as similar to that reported at Swansea University last week.
"(It) follows new guidance issued in relation to a chemical that we have held in our science laboratory," a spokesman said.
"We have followed the guidelines we have received from the experts and have evacuated the campus.
"We have arranged for all contract buses to return to campus to collect our students."
Friday's fire at the Tycoch campus destroyed part of the main building and, despite efforts to remove and replace damaged equipment, health and safety fears mean the 2,000 students will be kept away this week.
"Arrangements will be put in place to ensure that all students are able to catch up on any work lost," a spokesman said on Monday.
