[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Castle Bakery, founded in 1885, will shut its six shops in Caernarfon, Bangor, Menai Bridge, Beaumaris and Holyhead on Saturday.
The family-run company was founded by William Roberts on his return to Anglesey after a period in the colony in Patagonia, Argentina.
The firm, which has its headquarters in Beaumaris, refused to comment.
Its website said it serves more than one million customers a year and previously baked for the Royal family.
