The men's and women's 470 sailing medal races did not start because of a lack of wind in Marina da Gloria, with both rescheduled for Thursday.
Mills, 28, and Clark, 36, hold a 20-point lead going into the finale, and need only to finish to win gold.
"We were looking forward to getting a good night's sleep," said Clark.
Mills added: "It was a disappointing day. Obviously we wanted to get things wrapped up but they say good things come to those who wait.
"We have had a marathon week. Conditions have been wacky, up and down, and to have no wind today is tough."
Britain's Luke Patience and Chris Grube are sixth going into the final race of the men's event, and cannot win a medal.
But Dylan Fletcher and Alain Sign could force their way onto the podium in the men's 49ers medal race on Thursday.
The British pair, who are fourth, must finish four places higher than Australia or six above Germany to improve their position.
Charlotte Dobson and Sophie Ainsworth will also finish their 49ers FX campaign on Thursday, but without the prospect of a medal.
