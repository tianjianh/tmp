[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man has appeared in court accused of murdering a woman found dead at her home in Hertfordshire.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Nicola Cross, 37, was stabbed to death at her home in Dunlin Road, Hemel Hempstead on Monday night.
Marcin Porczynski, 23, of Claymore Avenue, appeared at Hatfield Remand Court charged with murder, two counts of kidnap and trespass with intent to inflict GBH.
In a tribute, Mrs Cross was described as "kind, generous and brave".
Mr Porczynski was remanded in custody to appear at St Albans Crown Court on Friday.
Using a Polish interpreter, he spoke only to confirm his name, age and address.
Officers were first called at 22:30 BST after receiving reports a man was acting suspiciously, police said.
They later admitted a man had been spoken to an hour before Mrs Cross's death but they let him go.
Her body was found when police responding to a separate call about a burglary at a neighbouring home heard a disturbance next door.
Hertfordshire Police have referred the incident to the Independent Police Complaints Commission.
A tribute statement issued by police on behalf of her family said: "Our Nikki is the heart and soul of our family.
"She was kind, generous, brave and incredibly talented - the most beautiful person inside and out, Nikki was the perfect wife and the most amazing mummy.
"She installed core belief in our children to never give up and we will continue what she has built, which is a solid loving family who will remember her with undying love."
A 19-year-old man arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to burgle has been released on police bail until 24 September.
