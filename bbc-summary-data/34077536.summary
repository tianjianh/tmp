Doctor's 'inappropriate' remark to mother who lost baby

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A mother from Powys whose son died from head injuries suffered during birth was told by a doctor she should "smoke 50 cigarettes a day so she has a smaller baby", a disciplinary panel has heard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Dr Sharon Elizabeth Oates made the "flippant" comment to Kate Langford and Andrew Barnett, from Newtown.
Jenson Christopher Barnett died on 18 June 2013, two days after being born at the Royal Shrewsbury Hospital.
The panel ruled Dr Oates remains fit to practise.
An inquest, held in 2014, ruled Jenson died from brain trauma caused during an unsuccessful forceps delivery. He was then born by emergency caesarean section.
The Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service (MPTS) panel, sitting in Manchester, was told Dr Oates later said: "Sorry about your baby, we didn't anticipate it being as big as it was."
The panel said her remarks "clearly caused some distress" and was "inappropriate".
Other allegations against Dr Oates, such as her failure to perform a foetal scalp blood sample and failure to change her forceps technique during delivery, were not found proven.
While Dr Oates made an "error of judgement", the panel concluded her actions did not reach "the threshold of misconduct".
