[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Jones performed for 50 minutes at Alnwick Castle on 8 August 2015 before a third power cut ended the show.
Northumberland County Council said an investigation had been carried out into the management and licensing of the concert by Loose Cannon Events.
A council spokesman said the "matter was now closed".
A council spokesman said advisory letters had been sent to the organisers.
Previously, Ticketmaster said, as the "majority" of the gig went ahead, customers would not get a refund.
Loose Cannon Events, which is based in Middlesbrough, has been approached for comment.
