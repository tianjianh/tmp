Ex-Det Con Michael McMillan, 32, contacted women "who looked to him for support" at Merseyside Police's Family Crime Investigation Unit.
Appearing at Liverpool Crown Court, he pleaded guilty to seven counts of misconduct in public office.
McMillan, from Crosby, was dismissed from the force in February.
He sent hundreds of texts to domestic abuse victims and convinced two of them to have sex with him, the Liverpool Echo reported.
The newspaper said he was caught when his phone was examined and a vast amount of sexual texts and images were found from between June 2011 and June 2014.
Ch Supt Karen Cummings said: "He manipulated women who looked to him for professional support, for his own sexual gratification and his behaviour is despicable and unforgivable.
"Sadly, the actions of Michael McMillan have the propensity to seriously undermine the good work of the majority."
An investigation was carried out by Merseyside Police and managed by the Independent Police Complaints Commission.
