Abandoned because of his bizarre looks, Fester the boxer dog, who is blind in one eye and has a protruding lower jaw, has finally been found a new home.

The one-year-old was handed in to the Dogs Trust near Darlington in December after being found wandering the streets as a stray.
Following an appeal on social media, the canine with "a heart of gold" has found a new forever family.
The trust said Fester would be leaving the charity's kennels early next week.
Fester was born with a narrow jaw which causes his lower teeth to stick out - creating some "unique features", a trust spokeswoman said.
"We were concerned that fun-loving Fester may have ended up being over-looked by potential new owners due to his unusual eye-catching appearance," she added.
"He is a gorgeous boy with an amazing character, so we couldn't imagine why anyone wouldn't want to have him as part of their family.
"He's had a rough time and it is fantastic news he will have a new home where he can settle and hopefully his character will shine through."
