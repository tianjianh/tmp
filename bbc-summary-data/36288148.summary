Man shot by police had been speaking to accomplices

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man shot dead by police as they foiled an attempt to free a prisoner was speaking to two accomplices minutes before his death, a jury has heard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Jermaine Baker, 28, from Tottenham was sitting in a car when he was killed by a single shot on 11 December 2015.
He was allegedly part of a gang trying to spring Izzet Eren from a custody van as he was being driven to an appearance at Wood Green Crown Court.
Ozcan Eren, 31, and Eren Hayser, 25, deny trying to help free Mr Eren.
Two other men, Nathan Mason and Gokay Sogucakli, have admitted being part of the escape plot.
The jury at Woolwich Crown Court was told a police surveillance bug placed in a stolen car, in which Mr Baker was waiting with Mason and Sogucakli, had picked up conversations between the men.
The court heard the recording of Mason taking a phone call at 09:00 GMT, which appeared to tell him where in the prison vehicle they should expect to find Izzet Eren.
The man is heard telling the others: "See, as you go in, yeah, it's the first door on your right."
Jermaine Baker is then heard saying: "So the door's here, boom boom."
Sogucakli can then be heard asking what they mean, to which Mason replies: "In the van, the first door on the right, that's where he is."
Just after 09:03 the audio picked up shouts of "armed police".
The jury was not played any audio beyond this point, however a single shot was fired by an armed officer, hitting Jermaine Baker, who died shortly afterwards.
Izzet Eren, who had been convicted of a firearms offence, had secreted a mobile phone in the van and was using it to organise his escape.
He has admitted arranging for the men in the car to free him by holding up the van using an imitation Uzi machine gun.
Ozcan Eren, of Wood Green, and Eren Hasyer, of Enfield, both deny conspiring in the escape plot and conspiracy to carry an imitation firearm with criminal intent.
Izzet Eren, Nathan Mason and Gokay Sogucakli, all of Tottenham, previously pleaded guilty to the same offences.
The case continues.
