[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A masseur has been convicted of sexually assaulting women while taking part in charity fundraising events.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Bradley Angus, 30, inappropriately touched a 28-year-old while giving her a massage at St Andrew's Church in Dumbarton in December 2013.
He also attacked a 45-year-old woman in her home while part of a fundraising group going door-to-door in Irvine, North Ayrshire, in June 2015.
At Kilmarnock Sheriff Court, sentence on Angus was deferred.
Angus, formerly of Balloch, now of Glasgow, was also placed on the sex offenders' register.
The court heard that the first attack took place at the church hall in Dumbarton where hairdressers, stylists, beauticians and nail technicians had offered their services in exchange for donations to good causes.
The 28-year-old victim was lying in a darkened room in the hall under a towel when Angus touched her genital area.
The woman's sister told the court: "I thought it was strange she was in for such a long time and when she came out she was walking back with her head down.
"I asked her if she'd had a good time and she said she didn't want to talk about it. She looked upset, shocked and embarrassed.
"I knew straight away there was something wrong with her and she told me what had happened."
In the second attack, Angus was allowed into a house in Irvine and taken to the kitchen by a 45-year-old woman while her husband looked after their young son.
She made him a cup of tea but moments later Angus fled the house as the "quite hysterical" victim called to her husband: "He's just touched me up."
The man followed and confronted Angus but he claimed the victim had touched him and made advances.
Sheriff Elizabeth McFarlane found Angus guilty of the sexual assaults which she said appeared to give him a "thrill" by being committed in public places.
Angus will be sentenced next month.
