Police are investigating after a swan was shot 21 times in the head in Powys.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The injured bird was found by a member of the public at Monks Pond, between Glasbury and Painscastle in Hay-on-Wye, at about 11:00 GMT on Wednesday.
It was taken to the vets but, due to the extent of its injuries, had to be put down.
Dyfed-Powys Police believe it was shot with a pellet gun. Sgt Craig Morgan said the treatment of the swan was "absolutely appalling".
He added: "Officers in Hay-on-Wye are carrying out enquiries. I would urge any member of our community who knows who is responsible to please come forward."
