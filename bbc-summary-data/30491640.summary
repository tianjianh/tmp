The force has launched a 'Rate your local police' website which the public can log on to and give up to five stars for the service they have received.
It aims to raise public confidence, help spot areas needed for improvement and create an easy way to get in touch as well as respond to feedback.
Dyfed-Powys Police is the only force in Wales piloting this project.
But it said the scheme is designed for leaving feedback and is not a forum for people to make formal complaints.
Police and Crime Commissioner Christopher Salmon said: "I hope that this tool will encourage people to feedback on positive experiences but also inform the force of areas they think can be enhanced."
