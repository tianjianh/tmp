The hosts took the lead when Martin Riley put the ball into his own net from Kevin Amankwaah's long throw-in.
Curtis Tilt came close to restoring parity after the break but his glancing header went just wide of the post.
Jordan White almost stole a late point for the visitors with a header of his own late on but Sutton held on to win.
Wrexham boss Dean Keates told BBC Radio Wales Sport: "I need to use a comment I have used a lot in recent games, it was frustrating.
"We had no tempo until the last ten minutes. We don't put the balls in the box.
"Why does it take us so long to get going? That's the million dollar question."
