They were found inside a plastic bag at a children's park on Rhosddu Road by a police community support officer.
They are now in the care of the RSPCA and are said to be "doing well".
RSPCA inspector Rachael Davies said: "It's so shocking to think someone would dump these poor animals like rubbish."
With no CCTV in the area, the animal charity is appealing for anyone with information to come forward.
