Kuba Oles was travelling at a minimum of 80mph (129km/h) when he hit Georgie Ann Evans' car in Dudley on 27 October.
Oles, 25, who had sped down Priory Road, only suffered minor leg injuries, West Midlands Police said.
Oles, from Beaconview Road, West Bromwich, admitted causing death by dangerous driving when he appeared at Wolverhampton Crown Court.
He was also disqualified from driving for 14 years.

PC Alan Wood, who headed the police investigation, said: "His driving on this day was extraordinarily dangerous and inevitably put other road users in peril.
"During police interviews he attempted to blame Georgie for being an [inexperienced] driver and pulling out too slowly.
"That was proved in court to be completely false and Oles was described as a dangerous person who posed a significant risk of causing the public harm."
Oles was also sentenced to nine months in prison, to run concurrently, for another dangerous driving offence which he also admitted.
Ms Evans's family said in a statement: "We give our thanks to the justice system for handing down the sentence they were able to.
"Unfortunately we are paying the ultimate sentence - the loss of our daughter."
