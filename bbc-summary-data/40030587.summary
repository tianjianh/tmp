The Turner Prize is named after landscape painter JMW Turner, who was inspired by the Thanet coast and gave his name to the Kent gallery.
The winner of the prize is revealed at a venue outside London every other year, with Margate to host in 2019.
Gallery director Victoria Pomery said it was "a truly transformative opportunity" for the seaside town.
She added: "It seems even more fitting to host the prize here in Margate on the site where JMW Turner was so inspired."
The unmade bed of artist Tracey Emin, who grew up in the seaside town, was controversially shortlisted for the prize in 1999.
In 1998, winner, Chris Ofili used elephant dung in his painting, and Damien Hirst won the prize in 1995 for displaying the severed halves of a cow and calf in formaldehyde.

The Turner Prize has previously been shown in Liverpool, Gateshead, Derry and Glasgow.
This year it will be held at the Ferens Art Gallery in Hull, with the Â£25,000 winner announced on 5 December.
