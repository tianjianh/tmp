[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Willie Rennie has blamed the Conservatives and the SNP for putting "divisive constitutional politics" at the centre of national debate.

He was addressing delegates at the Lib Dem party conference in Brighton.
Mr Rennie claimed the nationalists were too focused on holding a second independence referendum.
He also said the Conservatives had put the unity of the UK under strain with the EU referendum.
Mr Rennie told delegates: "With the blow of Brexit and the threat of another Scottish independence referendum it means that divisive constitutional politics remain at the centre of our national debate.
"It is a dismal scene that has been visited upon us by the Conservatives and the SNP. Stalled investment, uncertain future for EU citizens, divided families, split communities, economic instability, tensions between the nations of the UK.
"This is the work of the terrible twins of divisive politics."
Mr Rennie said the Liberal Democrats offered a "progressive, optimistic and outward looking" alternative.
He pointed to recent election wins by his party in Fife, Edinburgh and the Northern Isles, telling delegates the Lib Dems were "tearing up the script".
He added: "If we leave progressive politics to the SNP, then that will fail.
"If we leave the campaign for Scotland's place in the United Kingdom to the Conservatives it will fail too.
"That is why we need the Liberal Democrats."
