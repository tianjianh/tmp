Geri's Nineties: The Decade That Made Me will see the 44-year-old "reflect on her own incredible journey" in her first major presenting role.
In a statement, Horner said the 1990s were "a decade of hope, opportunity and change, in all areas of life".
The BBC said the show would offer a "glimpse into the real world of the female global superstar".
Jan Younghusband, the BBC's head of music TV commissioning, added: "We are thrilled that Geri has agreed to share her first-hand insights as a leading woman in music, and how the influences of her life have shaped her as a performer."
Horner shot to fame, under her maiden name of Halliwell, as the Spice Girls' feisty and flirty "Ginger Spice" .
On Tuesday, the singer revealed that her newborn son, born on 21 January, had been named Montague George Hector Horner.
His middle name is thought to be a tribute to her friend George Michael, who died on Christmas Day.
Last year Horner, Emma Bunton and Melanie Brown announced plans to reunite as a three-piece to celebrate the group's 21st birthday.
Earlier this month, though, it was reported that Horner had pulled out of the proposed reunion "to concentrate on her personal life".
