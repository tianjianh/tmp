A service to mark the 20th anniversary of the murder of a special constable by an IRA gunman has taken place in North Yorkshire.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Glenn Goodman, 37, was shot on the A64 near Tadcaster on 7 June 1992 after stopping a car to make a routine check. He died in hospital later that day.
Paul Magee, a member of the IRA, was sentenced to life imprisonment in March 1993 for the murder of Mr Goodman.
The service was held at St Mary's Church in Tadcaster.
Mr Goodman had only been a member of the North Yorkshire force for eight months at the time of his death.
About 1,000 mourners attended his funeral, which was held at Selby Abbey.
PC Sandy Kelly, Mr Goodman's patrol partner on the night of the attack, was also shot and badly wounded, but recovered.
Magee, together with his accomplice Michael O'Brien, was released from prison in 2000 under the terms of the Good Friday Agreement.
In 2003 Mr Goodman's parents called for police officers to be routinely armed.
Tim Madgwick, temporary Chief Constable of North Yorkshire, said during the service that officers faced challenging and dangerous situations every day.
He said: "When Glenn was murdered he was acting in the finest traditions of British policing; Glenn in his words joined the Special Constabulary 'to make a difference'.
"I am proud to have been a colleague of Glenn's in 1992 and as a force we will never forget his ultimate sacrifice."
North Yorkshire Police's chaplain, the Rev Simon Rudkin, conducted the service.
