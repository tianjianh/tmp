Some 20 suspected Islamists beat up customers and staff for drinking alcohol and listening to music during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan.
Unconfirmed reports said one person was injured in the incident late on Friday.
A protest on Saturday against the attack was dispersed by police using water cannon and tear gas.
Radiohead described the assault on the Velvet Indieground store as an act of "violent intolerance".
Local media reports said the male attackers used sticks and bottles against those present.
The store in the central Beyoglu district was livestreaming Radiohead's new album A Moon Shaped Pool.
A Radiohead statement said: "Our hearts go out to those attacked at Velvet IndieGround in Istanbul.
"We hope that someday we will be able to look back on such acts of violent intolerance as things of the ancient past.
"For now, we can only offer our fans in Istanbul our love and support."
