Joan Bakewell anorexia comments 'perpetuating stereotypes'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Young men and women who have battled anorexia have criticised Labour peer Joan Bakewell over her comments that the illness is a sign of "narcissism".

She told the Sunday Times "no-one has anorexia in societies where there is not enough food".
People diagnosed with the condition have told the BBC that her comments showed a misunderstanding of eating disorders in society.
The broadcaster, 82, later apologised for her comments.
Saskia Simm from Great Yarmouth, Norfolk, was diagnosed with anorexia two years ago, at the age of 15.
She says her mental illness was not the result of a narcissistic culture, but "may have been exacerbated by it".
"Rather, it sprung from a longing for perfectionism, control and release from depression and hopelessness that cannot be blamed on vanity."
She says she agrees with Baroness Bakewell that western society is becoming increasingly narcissistic.
"Young people in particular are often preoccupied with their appearance as they experience bodily changes, volatile emotions and social insecurity.
"However, I wholly contest the claim that anorexia is a product of narcissism."
She says weight loss is only a symptom of the underlying mental illness.
"Anorexia stems from a desperate need for control in a culture of surface-level freedom. It is a brutal, deadly and manipulative mental illness.
"Restricting one's food intake to the point of starvation in an attempt to experience this control may well be a 'coping strategy' chosen by the victim of a narcissistic, weight-obsessed culture, but the underlying mental illness is not."
Saskia says she is "well into recovery" now.
Susan Morris (not her real name) says she was first diagnosed with anorexia after a traumatic family event when she was 19 years old.
"I struggled to find a way of coping. I found comfort in the physical pain the hunger gave me as it took away from my mental pain.
"Following that, I then found being distracted by the obsession of calories, exercise and body weight useful. I needed that to take away the thoughts of what had happened."
At the age of 21, Susan was admitted to a unit for six months.
She says she is still struggling with the illness years later.
"At the age of 33, married with two children, I still really struggle and try to hide my bones as I feel embarrassed by it.
Susan says Baroness Bakewell's initial comments show that many people do not understand the condition properly.
"I think saying quite hurtful things about something people don't understand will not help the existing stigma with this, nor will it help people who are struggling as life is hard enough."
She says that what people affected by eating disorder really need is empathic support, understanding and more funding for research.
Rob Sayce from Sussex says Baroness Bakewell's comments underline "the ignorance and misinformation" surrounding the discussion about eating disorders.
"These comments simply perpetuate stereotypes about eating disorders and ignore the increasing wealth of research around the causes of these illnesses, such as trauma, genetics and societal factors.
"These are serious mental illnesses that can affect anyone, regardless of age, gender or social status, but often afflict people who have experienced trauma, bullying and abuse."
Rob, 22, was diagnosed with anorexia when he was a teenager.
He now considers himself recovered.
"As someone who has suffered from anorexia myself, I find it deeply worrying that intelligent people who should know better are content to perpetuate myths, without doing the basic research."
He says the suggestion that eating disorders only exist in western countries is wrong.
"The idea that eating disorders didn't exist in the past is also demonstrably bogus. The issues just weren't discussed to the same degree.
"These illnesses kill and destroy lives - anorexia nearly destroyed mine. They shouldn't be trivialised, and neither should the experiences of people who are affected by these conditions."
