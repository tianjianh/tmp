Matches will be on the BBC Red Button and BBC Sport website, and will include the British Basketball Cup finals, Trophy finals and Play-Off finals.
The BBL gets under way in September and the WBBL starts in October.
"We are excited about the opportunity that basketball affords as a sport with a digitally savvy audience," said Barbara Slater, director of BBC Sport.
There will be eight WBBL matches shown as part of the package, including the women's major finals, along with 24 men's games.
Sheffield Sharks won the 2016 Play-Off final with an 84-77 victory over Leicester Riders in May.
