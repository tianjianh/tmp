A new Royal Mail survey revealed there were more than 2,600 attacks across the country in the last year.
Nottinghamshire had the highest number of attacks - 68 between April 2015 and April 2016 - the report indicates.
The Communication Workers' Union said more than a third of attacks happen at the front door and "irresponsible" owners risk fines, or a jail term.
The number of dog attacks rises by 10% during the school holidays, when dogs are more likely to be in gardens unsupervised, the Royal Mail said.
Its research confirms that in the last year, 36% of attacks on staff happened at the front door, while 35% took place in the front garden - the equivalent to 1,888 attacks.

Tony Fox, operations director for Royal Mail, said: "We know that the overwhelming majority of dogs are friendly most of the time, however, even the most placid animal will defend itself if it feels its territory is being threatened."
Dave Joyce, of the CWU, said: "The vast majority of our customers and their dogs aren't a problem but irresponsible and reckless dog owners are.
"The new dog control laws now identify and penalise chronically irresponsible dog owners.
"One owner was recently fined Â£8,800 after his dog injured a postwoman as she put letters through the door."
TV presenter and dog lover Paul O'Grady, who is backing a campaign to reduce the number of dog attacks, said: "No one should feel unsafe in the workplace and it's important we as dog owners, take the necessary steps to give postmen this same respect."
Royal Mail delivers to over 29 million addresses in the country.
