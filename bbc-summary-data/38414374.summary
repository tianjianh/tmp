The France midfielder, 27, joined United from Southampton for £25m in July 2015, but has played only 11 Premier League minutes this season.
Baggies manager Tony Pulis confirmed the bid, while Red Devils boss Jose Mourinho said he "would not stop him" if the board was happy with the fee.
Everton are also interested.
Mourinho said Schneiderlin had asked to leave, adding: "If he is playing regularly, I have a right to say 'no way'. If he is not playing regularly, I have no right to say 'you are not going anywhere'.
"He is a great professional. A fantastic boy."
The offer for Schneiderlin is close to the club-record fee West Brom paid to sign Tottenham midfielder Nacer Chadli in August, which was reported to be £13m.
