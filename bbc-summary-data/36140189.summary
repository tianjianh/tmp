A Dutchman dubbed the "dentist of horror" has been sentenced to eight years in France for mutilating the mouths of more than 100 patients.

Jacobus van Nierop, 51, took out healthy teeth and caused horrific injuries to the patients in the small town of Chateau-Chinon.
Van Nierop was banned from practising dentistry and fined â‚¬10,500 ($11,900).
Van Nierop fled to Canada when suspicions arose and strongly fought against extradition to France in 2014.
The court in the central French town of Nevers heard that patients had suffered broken jaws, recurrent abscesses and septicaemia from van Nierop's work.
Van Nierop was arrested in France in June 2013, after the number of his victims grew to 120.
However, he fled the country before his trial was due to start in December that year.
He was tracked to a small town in the Canadian province of New Brunswick and arrested under an international warrant.
The BBC's Hugh Schofield in Paris says that van Nierop was many people's worst nightmare.
Like many parts of rural France, Chateau-Chinon is badly served for medical provision, our correspondent says, adding that locals initially seemed delighted by the hard-working and smiley dentist, a larger-than-life character who witnesses said was rarely seen without his "big 4x4, a big dog and a big cigar".
But then the horror stories began. People said they had teeth ripped out for no reason - they were given heavy anaesthetic, then left with abscesses and infected gums.
