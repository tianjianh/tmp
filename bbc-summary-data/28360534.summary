She warned that a bill proposed by former Labour Lord Chancellor Lord Falconer does not have "adequate safeguards".
Baroness Grey-Thompson said she was worried that disabled people might eventually be included in the legislation even though it was just intended for the terminally ill.
The 11-times Paralympic gold medallist is among those who has put their name down to speak in a debate on the Assisted Dying Bill in the House of Lords on Friday.
She said:  "I believe if this bill is passed it would have implications for me, maybe not now but in another 10 to 15 years.
"I already have a number of people who stop me in the street who say I wouldn't want to live if my life was like yours.
That's why I'm worried that this will be a slippery slope and that disabled people will be included in this at some point".
More than 130 peers are hoping to speak, a record for a single day of debate.
This interview with Baroness Grey-Thompson is part of the wider coverage of the differing views on this issue running on BBC News this week in the run-up to the debate.
