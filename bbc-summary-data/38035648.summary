[SN]TITLE[SN]
Crawley Town 3-2 Grimsby Town

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Marcus Bignot suffered his first defeat since taking over as Grimsby boss as Crawley deservedly clinched a first league win in seven games with victory at Broadfield Stadium.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Mariners top scorer Omar Bogle cancelled out James Collins' opener in first-half stoppage time, but Jordan Roberts scored twice in the second half before Bogle's last-minute consolation.
Crawley went into the clash without a win since 1 October, but took the lead in the 31st minute when James Collins produced a neat close-range finish after Adi Yussuf's excellent deep cross.
Grimsby drew level when Bogle notched his 15th league goal of the season with a header after a cross by Tom Bolarinwa deflected off Andre Blackman into his path.
Bogle was only just off target moments after the interval with a dipping 30-yard drive but Crawley went back in front in the 56th minute when Roberts neatly steered in his first goal of the season after being set up by Collins.
Roberts doubled the lead 11 minutes from time by scoring his second direct from a corner.
Bogle reduced the arrears in the last minute of normal time with a tremendous drive from 30 yards into the top corner but Crawley held on.
