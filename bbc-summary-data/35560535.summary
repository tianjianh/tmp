Jordan Wright, from Stanford-le-Hope, Essex, thought he had placed a £5 bet on Leicester to win their first match of the season against Sunderland, at odds of 2,000/1.
He roped in friend Mitchell Baldock to do the same, neither realising it related to the team winning the league.
The pair each won £10,000.

Mr Wright said he and Mr Baldock "thought BetFred had messed up the odds" for Leicester's first game of the season, so decided to place a bet to try to take advantage of the mistake.
The pair were mercilessly mocked by their fire brigade colleagues who told them the mistake they had made.
After realising his error, Mr Wright said he "didn't think too much" about Leicester's fortunes during the season "until the last quarter".
"It was when they won 3-1 against Manchester City - that's when I started thinking we had a real chance of winning," he said.
"Everyone loves an underdog so it was nice to see them win," Mr Wright, a London Fire Brigade worker, said.
"Every Premier League team wanted them to win, too - no-one will begrudge them for it."
Mr Wright said he had put part of his £10,000 into a personal training business he runs alongside his job, and was planning a trip to Las Vegas in June.
Mr Baldock, from Thurrock, had also put his share of the money into a new business, he said.
