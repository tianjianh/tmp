Lead panels were stolen from the roof of West Monmouth School in Pontypool on 31 December causing the ceilings to collapse on the IT suite and art rooms and damaging student's exam work.
Henllys Church in Wales School and Croesyceiliog Comprehensive, both in Cwmbran, were targeted in November.
Torfaen said it was a "massive waste of council resources".
Council leader Anthony Hunt said the latest attack was "devastating for pupils" who returned after the Christmas break to find their hard work ruined.
The council has CCTV footage of the most recent incident which they have passed to the Gwent Police.
Mr Hunt said: "This is not the first time we have faced this problem in Torfaen and the roofs have all been treated with SmartWater, which has previously helped the police to trace and prosecute individuals.
"We have also replaced a lot of lead with substitutes, so thieves could end up with something that is worthless to them."
