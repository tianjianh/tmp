[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Alice Pyne, 17, of Ulverston, died of Hodgkin's lymphoma in 2013 after publishing her wish list.
Haley McTaggart, 33, admitted getting her charity Alice's Escapes to pay Â£2,000 for her to go on a trek to Mount Kilimanjaro in Tanzania.
McTaggart admitted fraud and was jailed for 10 months suspended for two years.
The court also heard how McTaggart sold raffle tickets for a false raffle and never handed over the money.
She also told the charity that she was unable to transfer money after the trip to Tanzania.
Sentencing McTaggart, Recorder John Corless said she had committed an "unpleasant and serious" offence.
Alice's Escapes was founded in 2012 by Miss Payne who 16 at the time.
The teenager wanted to provide holidays in Cumbria for seriously ill children and their families.
The top item on her bucket list was the hope that everyone in the UK would sign up as a bone marrow donor, an aspiration which Prime Minister David Cameron praised in the House of Commons.
It is estimated that about 40,000 people signed up as donors as a direct result of her appeal.
Miss Pyne and her sister Milly raised more than Â£100,000.
