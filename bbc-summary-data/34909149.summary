Joyce top-scored with an unbeaten 33 as Ireland made a relatively modest 108-5 in their innings.
Scotland looked on course for victory as Rachel Scholes and Fiona Urquhart put on 30 for the opening wicket but the Scots then collapsed to 33-6.
Scotland finished on 81-8, with Irish captain Joyce taking two wickets.
Veteran Ireland leg-spinner Ciara Metcalfe started the rot by dismissing both openers in her first over.
Teenagers Robyn Lewis and Lucy O'Reilly also both took two wickets while player-coach Kari Anderson (14 no) and Sam Haggo (10) were the only other Scotland players to join Scholes (20) in reaching double figures.
The Scottish total was helped by the concession of 13 wides by the Irish.
Joyce's twin sister Cecelia contributed 21 in the Ireland innings.
The Joyce twins are sisters of Ireland and Sussex star Ed Joyce.
Ireland are back in action on Thursday when they take on Thailand in Bangkok before they start the tournament proper on Saturday against the Netherlands.
The top two teams in the eight-strong qualifying tournament will progress to next year's World T20 in India.
