'Welsh corner' for UK Parliament website's language services

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
All the UK Parliament's online Welsh-language services have been brought together in one place on its website.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Welsh Corner - Y Gornel Gymraeg - offers a one-stop shop for anyone searching for Welsh content on Parliament.co.uk.
The section, under the Get Involved heading, includes details of the Welsh Affairs select committee's work, which is now available in Welsh.
Services and publications can also be accessed there.
David Clark, head of outreach and engagement for UK Parliament, said: ""Having all our Welsh services in one place is a fantastic opportunity for the UK Parliament to further engage with and reach out to the growing Welsh language community.
"Investing in services, such as our Welsh language enquiry service, is a priority for us and demonstrates our commitment to outreach across the UK."
