Edmund had three match points but lost 2-6 7-6 (7-4) 6-2 to Jared Donaldson.
World number 43 Evans was given a point penalty for swearing midway through the final set of his 7-5 0-6 6-3 loss to American qualifier Ernesto Escobedo.
Watson, who reached the fourth round last year, was beaten 7-6 (7-4) 6-1 by Romania's Patricia Maria Tig.
The defeat means the Briton will drop from her current world ranking of 108 and is in danger of having to qualify for the French Open in May, with the entry deadline for the main draw on 17 April.
American Donaldson was serving at 0-40, 4-5 in the second set against Edmund, but the 20-year-old American held on to take the tie-break and dominated the decider.
Bedene was trailing Germany's Jan-Lennard Struff 7-5 4-0 when he was forced to retire from his match.
The British number four was playing his seventh match in as many days after winning a Challenger title in Irving last week.
