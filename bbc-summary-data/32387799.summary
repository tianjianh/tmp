The robot will help to welcome customers who visit the shop, and offer directions.
Mio Sakai has been working as the store's human receptionist for two years now, and says she feels honoured to work alongside the robot-lady.
The new robo-receptionist will be welcoming visitors to the store for the next few days, before working elsewhere in the store as a guide.
Martin's got more on the artificial assistant!
