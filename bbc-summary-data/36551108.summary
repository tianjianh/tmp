Jo Cox, MP for Batley and Spen, was 41.

First Minister Carwyn Jones said "everyone is in profound shock" while Welsh Tory leader Andrew RT Davies said she was "killed doing her job".

Mr Jones said: "Everyone is in profound shock at the sad and tragic death of Jo Cox.
"Jo had many, many friends in the Welsh Labour party and we all admired her passion and dedication to social justice."
Mr Kinnock, speaking on the BBC News Channel, said: "She was such a talented wonderful, wonderful person... great mother to her two kids and a hard worker in Parliament."
He said Ms Cox had "really made a name for herself" on the issue of Syria.
Mr Kinnock, whose mother Glenys Kinnock used to employ Ms Cox as an advisor, said if the attack was "specifically connected to her role as an MP and she was being targeted for that reason, then I think that does have much wider implications".
"I'm utterly devastated," said Ogmore Labour MP Chris Elmore, who last saw Ms Cox at an event on Tuesday.
Mr Elmore and Ms Cox had become friends after he joined Parliament following a by-election.
"I've only been an MP for six weeks but Jo was one of the first to welcome me," he said.
He said his thoughts were with her two young children, husband Brendan and her family.
Ann Clwyd, Labour MP for Cynon Valley, said: "She was a live wire. She was always ready to speak out about the issues she cared particularly about."
Nia Griffith, shadow Welsh Secretary, said: "We're all in deep shock at the way that Jo Cox died. Our sympathy are with the family at this terrible, terrible time."
She said: "I think its going to throw a really long shadow over the whole campaign.
"It will add a very sombre tone, and I think it will be something that unfortunately we will associate with the referendum ever more."
Ogmore AM Huw Irranca-Davies said: "A young life cruelly ended. My thoughts with her family."
Welsh Tory leader Andrew RT Davies tweeted that Ms Cox was "killed doing her job, serving her community and her constituents".
Hywel Williams, Plaid Cymru MP for Arfon, tweeted: "Saddened and shocked to learn of Jo Cox MP's death. Senseless violence."
Plaid Cymru leader Leanne Wood said: "My thoughts are with Jo Cox's friends, family and colleagues at this devastating time."
UKIP Wales leader Nathan Gill said: "So very sad for Jo Cox family. Such a senseless waste."
