Second through the sliding doors was Willie Rennie of the Scottish Lib Dems. He spoke about running away from the police "as a wee boy" and how he would fight in a war "if they would have me".
Asking the questions were Sarah (18); Jamie-Lee (16); Louis (16); Erin (18) and Megan (18).
They are all members of the BBC's Generation 2016 election panel.
Mr Rennie, who has been both an MSP and an MP, was posed the question: Who would you like to be stuck in a lift with?
He replied:  "I think, probably my wife, would be the first one, but if I'm allowed a second one, it would be Tom Hanks - the great actor.
"I love Forrest Gump, and I'm a softy for Turner and Hooch, which is a fantastic film, just a slob out film to watch, so Tom Hanks, my wife, and yourself [Generation 2016 questioner Megan]."
Other questions put to Mr Rennie included - have you ever been in trouble with the police; would you fight in a war; would you let a refugee live with you and is it fair that the minimum wage is lower for young people?
The Scottish Green Party's Patrick Harvie; Scottish Tory Ruth Davidson; Scottish Labour's Kezia Dugdale and the SNP's Nicola Sturgeon have also been part of the BBC's Leaders in a Lift series.
