A pilot who led the first Vulcan attack on Port Stanley airfield during the 1982 Falklands War believes the aircraft was a "force for peace".

Vulcan bombers were built at the height of the Cold War to carry Britain's nuclear weapons to the Soviet Union.
Pilot Martin Withers said: "Its original function was to keep the peace and not really to drop bombs."
Mr Withers was one of the pilots to fly the last airworthy Vulcan - XH558 - which is in its final season of flight.
Vulcans from RAF Waddington in Lincolnshire were involved in seven missions to bomb Port Stanley airfield.
The raids were the only time in the Vulcan's 30 year service with the RAF that saw it drop bombs in anger.
Mr Withers said aside from its use in the Falklands, the purpose of the Vulcan was to be a "nuclear deterrent".
"It's not there really to drop bombs, it was about developing something that is capable of doing it to make sure nobody does attack you.
"And it did prove it does work," he said.
He added: "It came very close in 1962 during the Cuban Missile Crisis."
Mr Withers has continued to fly the last airworthy Vulcan - XH558 - from its base at Robin Hood Airport, Doncaster.
The aircraft will be grounded on 30 October. The pilot said he has been greeted like a "rock star" at air shows during the bomber's final display season.
"People seem to really adore this aeroplane, I can't really explain it," he said.
"I've been on the ground at one or two air shows and people are just sobbing - grown men are crying on one another's shoulders and all the rest of it."
Mr Withers said he will miss flying the Vulcan but not its famously cramped cockpit.
Earlier this month, the XH558 bomber appeared over RAF Waddington and  Bruntingthorpe Airfield .
Bruntingthorpe was the Vulcan's first home after its RAF career and where the aircraft was restored by the Leicestershire-based charity Vulcan to the Sky Trust.
It said it was in talks with Robin Hood Airport and police about whether a final flight can be scheduled, given concerns about crowds around the airport.
If a flight does go ahead, the trust said it would be streamed over the internet to allow as many people as possible to witness the event.
Any announcement will be made on social media.
