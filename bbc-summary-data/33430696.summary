Lutfur Rahman: Corrupt ex-mayor's assets frozen

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Lutfur Rahman, the disgraced former mayor of Tower Hamlets, has been told his assets would be frozen after he failed to pay court costs.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
He was found guilty of electoral fraud in April, removed from office and ordered to pay Â£250,000 in court costs.
A High Court judge ruled earlier that an injunction freezing the domestic assets of Mr Rahman should be extended to include his assets worldwide.
He was also served with a disclosure order to declare his assets.
Andy Erlam, one of the four complainants who brought the High Court case against Mr Rahman, also applied for a freezing injunction after the former mayor failed to pay the immediate court costs.
Mr Justice Edis ruled earlier that Mr Rahman had to reveal his finances from the past five years and his tax returns from the past seven years.
Mr Rahman's wife Ayesha Farid is exempt from the disclosure order but the judge told Mr Erlam's barrister that he would welcome a separate application to get her to do so.
