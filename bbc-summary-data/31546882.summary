[SN]TITLE[SN]
Engineers work to fix 'stuck' Poole lifting bridge

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Engineers have spent the day working to fix an electrical fault on a lifting bridge after it was stuck in the upright position for several hours.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The bridge in Poole, which links the port with Hamworthy, had to close to traffic after becoming stuck.
It was eventually brought into the closed position to allow vehicles to cross, but engineers remained on the bridge dealing with the fault.
The bridge returned to normal operation by the evening rush hour.
Users had been advised to use the Twin Sails bridge while the lifting bridge was out of action.
An estimated 20,000 vehicles use the bridges, which lift every half hour, to cross the harbour each day.
