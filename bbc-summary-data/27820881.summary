A man arrested on suspicion of murdering York chef Claudia Lawrence has had his bail extended by police.

North Yorkshire Police released the 59-year-old on conditional bail last month after questioning him.
He had been detained over the disappearance of Miss Lawrence, who went missing from the city in 2009.
On Thursday, the force said the man had been re-bailed, so he remains on bail until an unspecified date as inquiries in the case continued.
Miss Lawrence, 35, who lived in Heworth, was due to start a 06:00 shift at the university on 19 March but failed to turn up.
Extensive searches of the area were made, but she was not found and police have since treated her disappearance as murder.
Police launched a review of the case last year and carried out new forensic work and searches of Miss Lawrence's home.
A fresh appeal for information was made on the fifth anniversary of her disappearance in March, which was broadcast on the BBC's Crimewatch programme.
Police revealed several new lines of inquiry had been generated by the review.
