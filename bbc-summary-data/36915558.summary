[SN]TITLE[SN]
M74 to close at J3A Daldowie for three weekends

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A busy junction of the M74 which sits on the boundary between Glasgow and South Lanarkshire is to close for three weekends to allow for upgrade work.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Junction 3A, Daldowie, will be closed from 20:00 on Friday to 06:00 on Monday the weekends of 29 July-1 August, 12-15 August and 26-29 August.
The work is part of the Â£500m M8 M73 M74 Motorway Improvements Project.
Drivers are advised to follow diversion routes during the closure and allow extra time for journeys.
During phase one of the closure - this weekend - work will be carried out on the roundabout to the north of the junction with four-way traffic signals in operation.
As a result, there will be no access to, or from, the motorway network via A721/A74) Hamilton Road Black Bear roundabout.
This includes the closure of the M74 north and southbound off-slips, and the M73 southbound off-slip link road to Daldowie.
The nearby A721 will also be reduced to one lane with temporary traffic lights.
Access to Daldowie Crematorium and the surrounding Daldowie estate will only be possible via the M74 northbound off-slip.
During phase two works will start to the roundabout at the south of Daldowie junction, at the entrance to the crematorium.
As a result, the M74 northbound off and on-slip roads, and the M73 southbound link road to Daldowie will be closed.
Two-way traffic signals will also be in operation, allowing single lane running across the M74 overbridge, providing access from Daldowie estate to the A721/A74.
Further works at Daldowie junction are anticipated in the coming months as the motorway improvements project continues.
