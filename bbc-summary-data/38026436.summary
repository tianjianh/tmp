Perry Beeches The Academy Trust school is 'inadequate'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An academy trust formerly praised by the government is to have another of its schools rated "inadequate."

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
An Ofsted report due out next week, but seen by the BBC, says Perry Beeches The Academy, is in "serious decline".
It comes after another school in Birmingham's Perry Beeches chain - Perry Beeches III - was put in special measures in October 2015.
The trust's acting chief executive officer, Paul Wheeler, said issues were being "addressed".
The Perry Beeches Academy Trust, which runs five schools in the city looking after 2,400 pupils, made headlines earlier this year when a £2.1m deficit was found when Mr Wheeler, then chief financial officer, carried out a health check.
It followed the resignation of trust chairman Liam Nolan back in May.
An Education Funding Authority investigation had found an additional salary of £160,000 was paid to Mr Nolan over two years through a third-party agreement - on top of his £120,000-a-year salary.
The trust was issued with a financial notice to improve.
In its latest report Ofsted said standards had deteriorated as a direct result of "weak governance".

Mr Wheeler said: "There are issues that the report has highlighted and I am addressing those issues along with our trustees."
The school was inspected on 21 and 22 September. It had been rated "outstanding" in 2013.
The trust has been praised by the government in the past with David Cameron and then education minister Michael Gove attending the opening of Perry Beeches III in 2013.
