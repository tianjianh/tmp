A second man has been arrested in connection with the death of a soldier in Brecon, Powys.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Pte Matthew Boyd from the Royal Gibraltar Regiment, was found injured and unconscious on Lion Street at about 01:00 BST on Sunday. He was taken to hospital, but later died.
A 23-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder on Sunday.
Dyfed-Powys Police said on Monday a 22-year-old man had also been detained in connection with the death.
Both men remain in custody.
Pte Boyd and his family lived in Gibraltar but he was originally from Northern Ireland, where some of his relatives still live in Carrickfergus, County Antrim.
The force said Pte Boyd was wearing civilian clothing when he was found and the 23-year-old who was arrested was not a serving soldier.
In a statement released on Sunday, a Ministry of Defence spokesman said: "It is with great sadness and regret that the MoD can confirm a soldier from the Royal Gibraltar Regiment died in Brecon in the early hours of this morning.
"Our thoughts are with his family and friends and the regiment asks that their privacy is respected at this difficult time."
