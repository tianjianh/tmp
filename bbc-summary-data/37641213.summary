[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The number of rape allegations in Wales has more than doubled in the last five years, new figures show.

Last year 1,657 allegations were recorded by police, of these 670 were child victims under the age of 16.
The total is more than double the 785 allegations recorded in 2011-12, according to Rape Monitoring Group data.
South Wales Police logged the largest number of allegations, while Dyfed Powys recorded the least.
The data is drawn from official figures by the Home Office, Office for National Statistics, Crown Prosecution Service and Ministry of Justice.
End Violence Against Women Coalition said the figures showed rape was not a "rare crime".
Its co-director Sarah Green said the spike in reporting showed the "desire to seek justice was increasing".
