Callum Burton: Shrewsbury Town keeper must prove himself to manager Paul Hurst

Shrewsbury boss Paul Hurst has told young goalkeeper Callum Burton that he must be ready to take his chance if he gets a first-team opening next season.

After making his Town debut on the final day of the 2015-16 season, Burton was limited to just three mid-campaign appearances on their bench in 2016-17.
But Hurst must now decide if Burton, 20, will be second choice next season following the release of Mark Halstead.
"Sometimes you never know until they're thrown in," Hurst told BBC Shropshire.
"Sometimes circumstances dictate and then it's sink or swim time.
"There's enough people that have gone on to have careers who I'm sure have made their debut due to circumstance rather than the manager thinking 'he's ready to play and I'm sure he's going to do superbly well for us'."
The reportedly once much-coveted Burton's experience has so far come in non-league, having had loan spells with Nuneaton Town and Southport in the Conference in 2014-15.
He was then loaned out again to sixth-tier level last season, first rejoining Nuneaton Town, before then going to fellow National League North side Telford.
While Jayson Leutwiler will remain Town's first-choice keeper, Hurst now has to decide whether he needs to bring in a more established back-up keeper.
Meanwhile, BBC Shropshire reports that experienced Irish midfielder Gary Deegan has been made available for a free transfer this summer.
