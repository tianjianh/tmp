The company, which has 31 branches across northern England, also said it planned to close two stores in Lancashire later this year.
Booths retail director Paul Minett said the "tough decisions" would enable the firm to have a "profitable future".
The firm said it was opening a new store in St Anne's and redeveloping its branch in Poulton-le-Fylde.
A new store will also open in Burscough, Lancashire, in July.
Mr Minett added the firm wanted a simplified management structure based on an estate of "profitable, vibrant stores".
The Preston-based retailer said it anticipated that the majority of employees at the closure-threatened stores in Ansdell in Lytham and Marton in Blackpool would be able to secure positions at the new branches.
However, due to an overall reduction in staff operating hours, it would be consulting  with employees.
Recently-opened stores at Hale Barns in Greater Manchester and Barrowford in Lancashire had created about 400 positions, it added.
The company, owned by the Booth family since 1847, currently has 31 stores in Lancashire, Yorkshire, Cumbria, Cheshire and Greater Manchester.
