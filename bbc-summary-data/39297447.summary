Celtic's new head of recruitment Lee Congerton hopes to work with manager Brendan Rodgers at the club for "many years to come".

Former Chelsea head of scouting Congerton and Rodgers previously worked together at Stamford Bridge.
The Welshman also worked as a coach with Liverpool and the Welsh FA and held director roles at Hamburg and Sunderland.
"I have got a great relationship with Brendan," said Congerton.
"He's worked for two of the biggest clubs in world football in my eyes - Liverpool and Celtic.
"I am sure that he is going to have other opportunities to go other places but I hope, like myself, that he is here for many years to come."
Congerton will head up recruitment of players and the scouting network, domestically and abroad.
He described last summer's capture of Moussa Dembele as "a marvellous signing", with the 20-year-old Frenchman netting 32 goals since joining Celtic from Fulham, including three in the Champions League group stage.
"Let's hope there's many more of those to come in the future," added Congerton.
"There's a lot to offer a young player here.
"Our priority is Scotland and Glasgow.
"You've always got to supplement that. We'll be looking everywhere. We have a network in place already. The guys have done great there and I will look to expand and add to that."
