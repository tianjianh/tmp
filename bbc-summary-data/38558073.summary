A Newport woman has been jailed for three-and-a-half years for setting fire to her neighbour's home.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Sheron Nichols, 54, poured lighter fuel through the letterbox of Christopher Edwards after he complained about her leaving rubbish outside their flats.
She pleaded guilty to arson with intent, saying she was drunk at the time.
The fire caused Â£59,000 of damage and Mr Edwards spent a week in hospital for smoke inhalation.
Cardiff Crown Court heard Nichols, of Itchen Road, had accused Mr Edwards of being a "grass" after he wrote to the council to complain about her mess.
Prosecutor Nicholas Gareth Jones said: "She left items in communal areas, causing a hazard.
"She held a grudge against him and said 'I am going to get you, you grass.'"
Mr Edwards said he felt "depressed and upset" after the incident.
"Every day my life has been damaged because of what has happened to me," he told the court.
James Evans, defending, said Nichols was drunk at the time.
"A sober Sheron Nichols would not have committed the offence," he said.
Judge David Wynn Morgan told her: "Your attack upon him was deliberate, it was vindictive, and it was wicked. It has severely damaged his life."
