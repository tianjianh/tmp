It is the second year of the "name our storms" project by the Met Office and Met Eireann, which takes suggestions from members of the public.
The names were selected from the 10,000 they received last year.
A storm will be named when it is deemed potentially able to have a substantial impact on the UK or Ireland.
The new list will be applied to storms between 1 October 2016 and September 2017.
The full list of the names is: Angus, Barbara, Conor, Doris, Ewan, Fleur, Gabriel, Holly, Ivor, Jacqui, Kamil, Louise, Malcolm, Natalie, Oisin, Penelope, Robert, Susan, Thomas, Valerie and Wilbert.
Unlike in the pilot project last year, heavy snow and rain may be taken into account when deciding whether a storm should be given a human name, although it will still need to be suitably windy.
Storms are not named using the letters Q, U, X, Y or Z in line with the naming conventions for hurricanes in the US.
The aim of the project is to raise awareness of severe weather and ensure greater public safety.
Derek Ryall, head of public weather services at the Met Office, said: "By naming storms more people were made aware of the approaching threat of severe weather and were able to act on this information."
Gerald Fleming, head of forecasting at Met Eireann, said last year's pilot project had helped prepare people in Ireland for "the impact of what was a very active Atlantic storm season".
Storm Abigail was the first storm to be named in November last year. It hit parts of Scotland and left 20,000 properties in the country without power at its peak.
Storms Desmond and Eva were responsible for England's wettest December in a century, leading to about 16,000 homes being flooded.
