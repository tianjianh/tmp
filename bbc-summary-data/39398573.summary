Ospreys head coach Steve Tandy says their defeat by Pro12 strugglers Benetton Treviso was a "disaster".

The Welsh region's hopes of winning a fifth Pro12 title suffered a blow as Treviso won 13-5 to seal just their third victory of the entire campaign.
Ospreys' Wales Six Nations stars, including Dan Biggar and Rhys Webb, were rested for the trip to Italy.
"Ultimately when you come away you should produce better performance," Tandy told BBC Radio Wales.
He continued: "The only good thing is that the only people who can put it right is us. It's a disaster for us and we've got a working week, now."
The defeat leaves Ospreys in third place in the Pro12 table, two points behind second-placed Munster and six points behind leaders Leinster, who narrowly beat Cardiff Blues earlier on Saturday.
"We want to be in the top two but at the end of the day the league doesn't lie. The performance [against Treviso] was not us which was really disappointing," Tandy added.
"We're not in the top two for a reason, because we weren't good enough."
Ospreys face Stade Francais at the Principality Stadium in the European Rugby Challenge Cup quarter-final on 2 April and Tandy will rearrange his starting XV.
"There will definitely be changes and we'll have a look at ourselves as a group but it is a different competition," he said.
"It would be nice going in with some momentum and a real positive vibe but ultimately it's a real kick in the guts for us."
