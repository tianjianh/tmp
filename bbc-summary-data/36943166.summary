The 18-year-old spent four days in hospital in an intensive care unit after having to retire from her girls' singles quarter-final.
Taylor, from Southampton, is yet to be given a diagnosis.
"It was such an awful experience, probably the worst time of my life," she told BBC Sport.
Taylor, ranked 375 in the world, has not picked up a racquet since she was forced to stop playing shortly after losing the first set against Kayla Day of the United States on 7 July.
"I couldn't continue," she told BBC South Today. "It was heartbreaking."
"It started the day before as a stomach bug and I managed to overcome it by winning my match that day.
"But, the day of the quarter-final, I woke up and felt 10 times worse. I couldn't believe it was happening to me in one of the most important tournaments of my life.
"I'm just thankful to be out of hospital and to all the staff at Southampton General who supported me and helped me through it."
