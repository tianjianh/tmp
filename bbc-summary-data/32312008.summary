[SN]TITLE[SN]
Obama to take Cuba off terror list

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
President Barack Obama will remove Cuba from the US list of state sponsors of terrorism, the White House says.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The move comes amid a normalisation of relations between the US and Cuba.
The Caribbean country's presence on the list was a sticking point for Cuba negotiators during talks to reopen embassies.
Mr Obama announced the historic US thaw with Cuba in December but the US trade embargo against the country remains, and may only be ended by Congress.
In a message to Congress, Mr Obama said the government of Cuba "has not provided any support for international terrorism" over the last six months and had "provided assurances that it will not support acts of international terrorism in the future".
