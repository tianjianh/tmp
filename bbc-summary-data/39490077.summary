Warwickshire opener Ian Westwood made his highest score in two years to help the struggling Bears restore some lost pride against Surrey at Edgbaston.

After missing his side's opening two County Championship innings defeats with a broken foot, the former Bears captain returned to hit a stunning 153.
Westwood shared an opening stand of 126 with partner William Porterfield (45).
Porterfield's was the first of three wickets for Tom Curran as Surrey limited the hosts to 292-6 at stumps.
Play ended 12 overs early because of bad light. But, after being bowled out for 91 and 178 in the first innings in their first two Championship matches of the season, against Surrey and Yorkshire respectively, the Bears have to be content with their first two batting bonus points of the season - and to be just eight runs short of a third.
After overwhelming the Bears at The Oval a fortnight ago, things did not go quite to plan for Surrey this time after opting to bowl on a good batting pitch.
Despite the floodlights being on all day, under grey skies, 34-year-old Westwood lit up Edgbaston with 21 fours, 14 of them before lunch, and two sixes.
He shared a 79-run stand for the third wicket with his captain Ian Bell (33). But, led by Curran (3-90), the Surrey seamers fought back impressively in the final session, taking three wickets.
After completing his 16th first-class century, Westwood went to what proved to be the final ball of the day to give Mark Footitt a second wicket and Scott Borthwick a third slip catch.
Warwickshire opener Ian Westwood told BBC WM:
"We have got off to a tricky start to the season so it was nice to have a better day. I wanted to bat positively. It was easier for me, not having the baggage of the last two games, to go out there and bat a bit more freely.
"Conditions were a bit tricky all day with the lights on all day and overcast conditions. It was just a case of trying to be patient. So far this season we haven't managed to put opposing bowlers under any pressure so we spoke about scrapping away but also looking to capitalise on any bad balls.
"I worked really hard pre-season so to crack a bone in my foot was really disappointing. But I have hit a lot of balls in the last two or three weeks to try to get ready.  I was in no discomfort from the foot but I haven't done any running for weeks so, having run three all-run fours, it was my lungs that were struggling a little bit."
Surrey bowling coach Stuart Barnes told BBC Radio London:
"We definitely got better as the day went on. We weren't pleased with the first session at all - we didn't get many balls in good areas, like we have done so far this year and we paid the price for it.
"But we started bowling in partnerships in the last session and restricted Warwickshire to 50 runs off the last 20 overs.
"It wasn't a great start but we got better near the end."
