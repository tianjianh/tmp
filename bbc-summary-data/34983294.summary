Jersey golfer Olivia Jordan-Higgins says she will not give up on her dream of competing on the LPGA tour.

The 27-year-old currently plays on the Symetra tour in the USA, with the top 10 each year earning an LPGA card.
She finished a career-worst 55th on the money list this year, but says she feels refreshed after changing coaches.
"With the way I'm feeling mentally and confidence-wise I don't see myself giving up until I achieve my dream of being on the LPGA tour," she said.
Jordan-Higgins says lack of money would be the only reason for her to quit, which was something she considered before finishing second in an event in Kansas.
"For the last few years I've been pretty much able to support myself. I'm not making too much of a profit, but I'm making enough that I can keep playing and keep trying to achieve my dream," she told BBC Radio Jersey.
"But this year was one of those where the decision was almost made for me as I was essentially out of money."
She now hopes 2016 will be the year that she finally earns the right to play amongst the world's elite women golfers.
"There's no question that I can finish inside the top 10, I've been close for four out of the five years," she added.
"I've got a new coach I'm working with and it's been very good.
"A lot of it is mental focus, working on pre-shot routines and making sure it's the same every time.
"I'm feeling really confident about what we're doing and I've got that drive back to want to achieve again."
