Aston Villa 1-1 Brentford

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Aston Villa were held to a draw for the third Championship home game running as John Egan's scrambled late equaliser earned Brentford a point.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Villa looked on their way to a comfortable win after Jonathan Kodjia's stunning first-half left-foot curler, his first goal for the club.
But Dean Smith's Bees stayed in the game and had the character to hit back.
From Sullay Kaikai's neat chip to the far post, Villa failed to clear their lines and Egan stole in to equalise.
Having been denied victory on Sunday only by the woodwork and the brilliance of Nottingham Forest keeper Vladimir Stojkovic, Villa appeared eager to make amends.
But it still took a flash of brilliance from new signing Kodjia to get them on their way on 19 minutes.
The striker took a pass from Mile Jedinak down the right, worked his way to the edge of the area and hit a left-foot shot which curled beautifully into the far-left corner.
Josh Clarke then fired over the bar from close range for Brentford in a flurry of chances for the Bees.
But, for all the hard running and tackling in midfield, epitomised by former Shrewsbury Town midfielder Ryan Woods, they lacked a cutting edge.
By contrast, Villa did have chances, as Kodjia got on the end of Jordan Ayew's cross, Ayew shot over with a left-foot curler and Kodjia brought a save out of keeper Daniel Bentley.
But the introduction of Crystal Palace loan man Kaikai brought its rewards for boyhood Villa fan Smith.
Kaikai had already caused concern in the home ranks before he cut back onto his right foot to curl over a cross in the 88th minute, from which Egan managed to force the ball home.
Aston Villa manager Roberto di Matteo told BBC Sport:
"We need to be more clinical in front of goal, we could have scored five on Sunday. But most of all we also need to see games out.
"We allowed them to get too much of the ball in the second half and we got a bit nervous in the last 10 minutes. We just need to win. Win ugly, or attractive. It doesn't matter.
"Jack Grealish could not play as he had a problem with his hamstring, Ross McCormack has knock on his knee and Richie de Laet got a knock clearing the ball at the far post. He is in a lot of pain and we will have to see about him."
Brentford boss Dean Smith told BBC Sport:
"It was the least we deserved. We'd have been very disappointed to go away without getting something.
"I was disappointed with their goal. But I suppose that's what Â£15m gets you and it was a good finish.
"Everyone knows I was a Villa fan growing up in Great Barr as a boy and to come here as a manager was a great experience but, if we'd lost, it would have meant nothing. My mates who are all Villa fans asked me if I'd celebrate and I think I gave them the answer."
