[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Kidderminster Harriers failed to move off the bottom of the National League as Joe Anderson's late strike condemned the strugglers to defeat by Bromley.

Harriers looked more likely to go ahead as Bromley keeper Alan Julian denied Kelvin Langmead before saving well from fellow home defender Keith Lowe.
But Anderson then won it on 86 minutes, curling a low, 25-yard free-kick into the bottom corner past Dean Snedker.
Harriers' 21st defeat of the season leave them 10 points adrift of safety.
Harriers boss Colin Gordon told BBC Hereford & Worcester:
"We've conceded a rubbish goal. Our goalkeeper has apologised because it was a huge mistake.
"They didn't have a shot, but their keeper has made two or three great saves.
"We didn't play well, but we were still in the game and we did our jobs."
