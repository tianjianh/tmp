A British soldier from 1st Battalion The Mercian Regiment who died in Afghanistan on Tuesday has been named as L/Cpl Jamie Webb.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
L/Cpl Webb, 24, from Wythenshawe, Greater Manchester, was injured in an attack by insurgents in the Nad-e Ali district of Helmand Province on Monday.
He was flown to hospital but died later. He is the first UK soldier to be killed in Afghanistan since January.
His family said they were "so proud of Jamie being a Mercian soldier".
Their statement added: "Jamie is loved by his dad Dave, mum Sue and his close family and friends."
Lt Col Phil Kimber, L/Cpl Webb's commanding officer, described him as "a real character, a totally professional soldier and a great friend to many".
He said: "He was exactly the type of man you wanted around. Always with a smile on his face, always willing to engage in some witty and mischievous banter, he really did lift the morale of all around him.
"He was also an outstanding professional; bright, engaging and hugely talented. He had an obvious gift for intelligence work, which ensured he was at the heart of all that his company did on this tour."
L/Cpl Webb was surrounded by his friends when he was injured, the officer added,
"These friends and all in 1 Mercian Battlegroup will miss him terribly. We have lost a great soldier and a great friend. Despite our grief, we are acutely aware of the indescribable loss his family will now be feeling and it is his family that our thoughts and prayers are now with."
Capt Richard Sawyer said the soldier was "undoubtedly one of life's true characters".
He said: "Never one to hide from the limelight, he was always ready to treat those around him, be it a private soldier or the officer commanding, to one of his impressions or jokes - which invariably resulted in hilarity for all those present. Jamie Webb was constant morale."
L/Cpl Webb joined the army aged 18 after attending Wilmslow High School and Macclesfield College in Cheshire.
His first posting was to Ballykinler, Northern Ireland, and he was also deployed to Iraq. He was on his second tour of Afghanistan, for which he had been promoted, when he died.
Some 441 UK service personnel have now died since operations in Afghanistan began in 2001.
L/Cpl Webb is the third to die so far in 2013.
