Rob Maclean: Can Celtic keep key quartet? Aberdeen & Thistle on the up

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Fans of champions Celtic will fear high-profile departures in the summer. Kieran Tierney, Stuart Armstrong, Scott Sinclair and Moussa Dembele will all be on the wanted list at some top clubs.

BBC Scotland football commentator Rob Maclean continues his regular review of the weekend football action.
But, as long as manager Brendan Rodgers stays on, I don't see any real cause for concern.
I'm not saying the Fab Four above will all still be in Scotland for the start of next season. The market will decide.
If any of them leave, it will be in return for a hefty chunk of compensation to further strengthen Celtic's finances.
If Rodgers reinvests in players as well as he recruited when he first got here - and he has a stronger sales pitch plus more dosh this time - there's not too much for Celtic supporters to worry about.
In Brendan they trust. And so they should.
Some of Hearts' January signings arrived on a short-term deal. Probably just as well.
Expect a big turnaround in personnel when the next transfer window swings open.
I hope head coach Ian Cathro is still around to have some say on squad changes, although results will decide his future and one win in eight games is a pretty desperate recent record.
They started well against Celtic on Sunday but folded when they missed early chances to score and the champions taught them a lesson in clinical finishing.
It turned into a disjointed, error-strewn performance from Hearts, even allowing for the quality of the opposition, and they face a struggle to reclaim fourth place in the Premiership.
I'm about to vote for Premiership manager of the month for March and it surely has to be Aberdeen's Derek McInnes.
His team won all three league games and, even though it shouldn't be a factor in the voting process, they reached the Scottish Cup semi finals as well.
The Dons didn't concede a goal last month and scored 11, with all but four of them being netted at Dens Park on Friday night.
Dundee were dreadful, but it was still a sparkling performance from Aberdeen, who are now nailed-on runners-up after winning 11 of their past 13 in the league.
I did wonder how McInnes would improve his team this season without significant signings, but credit to him, he's done just that.
With AA in the driving seat, Partick Thistle appear to have no need of breakdown assistance.
Alan Archibald has helped hoist the Jags well clear of the relegation issue and they have the look now of top-six certainties.
Six is the number of unbeaten matches they've recently reeled off. Four of them were wins. The other two - I was there - could so easily have been victories as well.
I did say a few weeks back that the goals of Kris Doolan would ensure their top-flight survival and he rightly grabbed the headlines on Saturday for becoming a Thistle scoring centurion.
But he'd be the first to pay tribute to understated gaffer Archibald, who's performing minor miracles on a tight budget.
Ross County have reversed the trend of recent seasons and slipped into serious relegation trouble.
We've become accustomed to the Dingwall side climbing away from the drop zone in the second half of the season.
This time around, they're moving in the other direction, having been in the top half of the table at the turn of the year before thumping Dundee United 6-2 in the Scottish Cup.
But they've picked up only five Premiership points in 2017. All of their rivals at the wrong end have managed more.
And, all the time, County are sliding closer to neighbours Inverness Caledonian Thistle at the bottom of the league.
