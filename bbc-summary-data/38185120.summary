A one-legged amateur footballer has been shortlisted for the Scottish Professional Football League's goal of the month.

Dundee United fan Tommy McKay scored during a half-time challenge at Tannadice last month.
The goal is featured in the SPFL facebook post on the nominated goals for November.
The 32-year-old had his right leg amputated after he was found to have bone cancer as a child.
Tommy made no mention of his disability when he entered the McEwan Fraser Legal #HomeAdvantage Challenge competition for a chance of winning a hospitality ticket but was welcomed into the contest.
His goal, during half-time entertainment at Dundee United's match against Dunfermline on 8 November, earned a huge roar from the 6,000-strong crowd.
Tommy travelled half the length of the pitch on crutches before lobbing the ball past keeper Brett Long and into the back of the net.
Footage of the goal has since been viewed more than two million times after it was posted on YouTube, Facebook and Twitter.
Tommy said was it was "unbelievable" to be nominated for his goal, alongside seven professional  players.
"It's very humbling to be considered in the company that I am," he said.
"Fantastic professionals. And to think that for this month's goal of the month competition I'm in that company is beyond my wildest dreams."
Recalling his moment of glory, he added: "I was just happy to get on Tannadice really, and the intention was just not to fall over - or my trousers or something to fall down.
"But I thought: 'Why not?' I had to take my chance when it came along. It's worked out quite well, and the response to the goal and the video has been phenomenal."
His goal came in the same week that Scottish charity Amputee Football Association Scotland (AFAS) was launched with the aim of growing the sport of amputee football in Scotland.
Ashley Reid, of AFAS, said: "We're really excited for Tommy. To see him get the chance to score at Tannadice and knowing what that meant to him personally was fantastic - but now for his strike to make the SPFL Goal of the Month nominations is the stuff of dreams.
"Tommy's goal has helped put a spotlight on both the sport and on Amputee Football Association Scotland and we're thrilled that amputee football is getting the recognition it deserves by way of this nomination."
Tommy, from Monifieth in Angus, has been a lifelong fan of Dundee United.
He believes football saved his life as his cancer only came to light when, as an eight-year-old boy, he snapped his femur while attempting a Johan Cruyff turn.
He has continued to play football throughout his adult life and is now midfielder for Scotland's only amputee team, Partick Thistle Amputees FC.
His goal at Tannadice helped persuade McEwan Fraser Legal to provide financial support for the amputee team to attend its first international fixture next year in Limerick.
