Barnsley assistant head coach Tommy Wright has signed a 12-month rolling contract with the Championship club.

Wright joined Barnsley in February 2015 as number two to former boss Lee Johnson, who he also worked alongside at League One club Oldham.
The 50-year-old rejected an offer to take charge of Bristol City's under-21 squad in June.
"He's been a big part of the success of the club and he's happy here," Barnsley head coach Paul Heckingbottom said.
