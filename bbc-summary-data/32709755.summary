Cornwall has highest rough sleeper numbers outside London

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The number of rough sleepers in Cornwall is the highest in England outside London, according to government figures.

The latest statistics suggest 40 people a night were sleeping on streets or rough ground in the county last autumn.
The situation in Cornwall is being blamed on high house prices, lower wages and unstable work.
Only Westminster and Hillingdon in London had higher numbers or rough sleepers.
The Department for Communities and Local Government figures are based on information given to Cornwall Council by agencies supporting homeless people.
Alistair Young, interim chief executive at Coastline Housing in the county, described them as "the tip of the iceberg" and said there could be many more rough sleepers in Cornwall.
He said 90% of the rough sleepers it helped were local people, who were "much less able to deal with the shocks to their lives that cause a risk to being homeless than in other parts of the country".
He added: "The housing is expensive; renting is expensive as well. Coupled with that, wages are a lot lower in Cornwall and a lot of people are in very short-term unstable work."
The average South West house price was Â£278,378 compared to Â£286,133 nationally, according to Rightmove's April House Price Index.
Average wages in Cornwall stood at Â£14,300 a year, making it the UK's poorest region, according to statistics produced last year by Eurostat, the statistical office of the European Union.
One rough sleeper in Kehellend, who only wanted to be named as Paul, said he had been "turned out" of his family home after his marriage broke down and he developed depression.
"My whole world had collapsed," he said.
Paul said he planned to return to work once his health improved.
He advised others in his position to "get to the day centres, use their resources and take care of yourself".
