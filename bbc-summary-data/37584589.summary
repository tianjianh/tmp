Cavell Hutson, 21, of north London stole 21 mobile phones before he was arrested by police, but his accomplice managed to escape.
The thefts, on 3 September, involved phones being grabbed out of people's hands as the thieves passed by on a moped.
The video shows CCTV footage of the pair taking a phone and helicopter film of the moped being ridden through Kingsland Market in Hackney during a police pursuit.
Hutson was sentenced to more than three years in prison at Blackfriars Crown Court on 3 October.
