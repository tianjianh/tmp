Konta, 25, arrives at SW19 as the 16th seed after reaching the Australian Open semi-finals in January and will face Puerto Rico's Monica Puig.
World number two Murray, 29, meanwhile, faces another Brit in 22-year-old Liam Broady - ranked 235th in the world.
Britain's world number 772 Marcus Willis stole the headlines on day one, setting up a tie with Roger Federer.
Murray's meeting with Broady, who has been seen hitting with high-profile names such as Milos Raonic and the Canadian's coach John McEnroe this week, will take place on Centre Court after defending champion Serena Williams opens day two against Swiss Amra Sadikovic at 13:00 BST.
"It's an opportunity for him to play on one of the biggest courts in the world with a huge audience and try to cause an upset," said Murray, champion in 2013.
There will be added scrutiny of world number two Murray as he embarks on his first Grand Slam since reuniting with coach Ivan Lendl, who formed part of his camp when he won his two majors.
Fresh from becoming the first British woman to reach the semi-finals of Eastbourne's Aegon International since 1976, Britain's highest ranked woman Konta faces Puig, whose appearance in the last four at Eastbourne was her second grass-court semi-final of the summer.
They will follow Stan Wawrinka and Taylor Fritz on Court One.
In all there are seven British players in action on day two.
Wildcard Katie Swan, 17, will hope to upset Hungarian Timea Babos, Heather Watson takes on Germany's Annika Beck (around 17:00 BST), Tara Moore plays Belgian Alison van Uytvanck, and British men's number two Aljaz Bedene faces French seventh seed Richard Gasquet (11:30 BST).
Away from the home interest, Swiss fourth seed Stan Wawrinka plays American 18-year-old Taylor Fritz, while Australian 15th seed Nick Kyrgios faces a fascinating contest against 37-year-old Czech Radek Stepanek.
In the women's draw, third seed Agnieszka Radwanska plays Ukraine's Kateryna Kozlova and two-time former champion Petra Kvitova faces Romanian Sorana Cirstea.
Qualifier Willis stunned world number 54 Ricardas Berankis, to become the lowest-ranked player to reach round two since 1998, where he will earn £50,000, having won £220 all year.
Willis, 25, faces seven-time champion Federer, who beat Guido Pella.
Dan Evans overcame Jan-Lennard Struff in four sets and Britain is guaranteed three men in round two as Murray faces Broady.
Defending champion Novak Djokovic - seeking a calendar Grand Slam having already won the Australian and French Open titles this year - produced 21 unforced errors but was in no mood for an upset as he overcame Britain's James Ward in straight sets on Centre Court.

The Serb has not lost at a Grand Slam since his defeat by Wawrinka in last year's French Open final, a run of 29 matches.
South African Kevin Anderson, seeded 20, and Germany's Philipp Kohlschreiber, seeded 21, were the best-ranked players to go out on day one.
There were also wins for David Ferrer, Marin Cilic and David Goffin in Djokovic's half of the draw, while sixth seed Milos Ranoic served 27 aces to advance in straight sets.
Fifth seed Kei Nishikori faced a 142mph serve - the fastest of day one - from Australian Sam Groth but won through 6-4 6-3 7-5.
French Open champion Garbine Muguruza provided an early show of grit on day one as she faced a tough test against Italy's Camila Giorgi before progressing 6-2 5-7 6-4.
The number two seed is in the same half of the draw as five-time champion Venus Williams, who equalled Amy Frazier's record of appearing in 71 Grand Slams as she overcame Croatia's Donna Vekic in straight sets.
Williams, 36, has not won a Grand Slam singles title since 2008 - in which time her sister Serena has secured 13.
The 2008 French Open champion Ana Ivanovic was the first notable scalp in the ladies' draw, citing an injured wrist after defeat by 21-year-old qualifier Ekaterina Alexandrova, who hit 19 winners.
Germany's Sabine Lisicki, a finalist in 2013, blasted nine aces - including three in a 52-second opening game - to beat Poland's Magda Linette.
