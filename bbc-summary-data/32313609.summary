Markets were down in China after growth data showed the country's economy had slowed further in the three months to March this year.

Official numbers showed an expansion of 7% for the period - the slowest economic pace of growth since the global financial crisis in 2009.
The Shanghai Composite on the mainland was down 1.11% at 4,089.52.
While the benchmark Hang Seng index in Hong Kong was down 0.05% at 27,547.75 points.
Analysts said they expected China's economic growth to have slowed to 7% in the quarter - lower than the 7.3% posted for the three months to December.
Last year, the world's second-largest economy grew at its slowest pace since 1990, expanding by 7.4%.
Analysts said slower growth, together with the country's cooling property market - a key economic driver - was likely to mean further easing by China's central bank this year, including further rate cuts among other measures.
The benchmark Nikkei 225 was down 0.06% at 19,897.39 points.
A new report by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) upgraded the outlook for Japan's economic growth.
But the report, which said lower oil prices and a local weaker yen were likely to boost Japanese growth, did little to boost investor sentiment.
In its latest World Economic Outlook, released on Tuesday in Washington, the IMF said Japan's economy was expected to expand by 1% this year and by 1.2% in 2016, compared to an earlier forecast of 0.6% and 0.8% respectively.
In Australia, the benchmark S&P/ASX 200 index was down 0.81% at 5,898.50 points.
The IMF report said that Australia was facing a downturn in commodity prices that was "continuing to hit [its] economy".
It forecast that Australia would post economic growth of 2.8% in 2015 and 3.2% next year, in line with previous forecasts.
Australian Treasurer Joe Hockey said this week that the recent plunge in the iron ore prices would reduce revenue forecasts by A$25bn (Â£13bn; $19bn) over the next four years.
Meanwhile, South Korea's benchmark Kospi index was flat, up 0.06% at 2,112.90.
