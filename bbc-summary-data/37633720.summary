South Central Ambulance Service said the driver suffered a serious head injury and was airlifted to hospital following the crash near Maidenhead.
The lorry crossed the central reservation shortly before 12:45 BST on Wednesday.
The motorway was shut westbound between junctions 8/9 and 10 and reopened at 05:45 BST.
About 300m of the central reservation and a lighting column were damaged in the crash, Highways England said.
The road had to be resurfaced because the vehicle had spilled "a large quantity of diesel" and 24 tonnes of vegetation waste onto the carriageway.
