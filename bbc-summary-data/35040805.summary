Fly-half Jack Carty kicked 20 points for the hosts in Galway, who top Pool One at the halfway stage in the group.
Replacement centre Danie Poolman crossed for a try with six minutes remaining to deny Newcastle a chance to claim a losing bonus point.
Captain Richard Mayhew bagged a second-half try for the visitors, but two points was as close as Newcastle got.
Carty's kicking ensured Connacht led throughout and the 23-year-old missed just one attempt from seven on the night.
The defeat leaves Newcastle second in the pool with third-placed Brive playing Russian side Enisei-STM on Saturday.
