[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Dundee's bid to become European Capital of Culture 2023 has been the focus of a conference in the city.

About 150 delegates attended the event, including Theresa Blegvad, culture convener of Aarhus in Denmark, the 2017 title holder.
Dundee, Leeds, and Milton Keynes have declared interest in the title, which two European cities share every year.
The UK was already lined up to host in 2023 before the country voted to leave the European Union last June.
It is not yet known whether the EU will let the UK host now that Article 50 has been triggered.
Aarhus is hosting four large-scale events, each attracting at least 40,000 people, during its European Capital of Culture tenure.
Ms Blegvad, who leads the Nordic office of Dundee-based learning and development company Insights, has been asked to support the team working on Dundee's bid.
She said: "Aarhus was going through a transformation when we applied for the title, much like Dundee is now.
"The change was already happening, but we seized on the unconscious to create momentum and purpose and drive more change.
"We consciously focused our bid on highlighting everything the city had to offer and the developments to become more modern and international.
"Things have continued to blossom since then."
