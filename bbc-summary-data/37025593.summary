Police appeal for information in Byron insect attacks

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The police have issued images of three men they wish to speak to in connection with the release of insects at two Byron burger restaurants in central London.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The men are suspected of unleashing locusts and cockroaches at the outlets in Holborn.
The incidents occurred as protests were taking place outside the premises.
The protests followed the arrest of dozens of Byron burger staff for immigration offences.
The Home Office said 35 people from Albania, Brazil, Nepal and Egypt were arrested at Byron restaurants across London.
The raids on 4 July were "intelligence-led" and were carried out with Byron's "full co-operation", it said.
"At around 19:00 on 29 July an unknown number of male suspects entered the Byron restaurant on St Giles High Street, Holborn and released a number of locusts and cockroaches onto the restaurant floor and in the male toilets," the Met said.
The suspects then moved onto a second branch in High Holborn where they repeated the acts.
On both occasions, customers were asked by staff to leave the premises and the restaurants were closed.
The police described the first suspect as dark-skinned, of medium to heavy build, unshaven with thinning hair.
He was wearing a bulky hooded anorak, brown shoes, blue jeans and was carrying a rucksack.
The second suspect is dark-skinned, of thin build, with long hair - tied at the back - and unshaven.
He wore thick-rimmed glasses and a black tracksuit with white stripes along the arms, and carried a bag or satchel over his shoulder.
The third suspect is described as dark-skinned, of thin build, with short hair and a short beard.
He was wearing a brown blazer, blue shirt and light grey or beige trousers.
