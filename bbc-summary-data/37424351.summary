Regional strategy needed for eradication of knotweed

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A regional strategy is needed to deal with an invasive plant which is causing misery for homeowners, the assembly has been told.

Japanese knotweed grows quickly and can penetrate concrete.
Mortgage companies will often refuse home loans on properties where it's present.
The plant was introduced in the Nineteenth Century as an ornamental species.
It is an offence to spread it, but it is a matter for the civil courts when there is a dispute over the responsibility for tackling it.
The case of the Atkinson family, from Newtownabbey, County Antrim, was raised during an assembly motion on Tuesday.
The plant has spread onto their property from adjoining waste ground.
Introducing the motion, DUP MLA Pam Cameron said it was growing at a rate of eight inches every day.
Cutting or digging it up only spreads it further.
The alternative is an expensive chemical treatment which can last for up to seven years.
Ms Cameron said dealing with Japanese Knotweed was costing the UK up to £179m a year.
Sinn Féin MLA Linda Dillon, who is head of the Agriculture and Environment Committee, said they had asked departmental officials for information about the number of cases, the geographical spread and the potential cost of dealing with the plant.
She said that at the moment, the authorities here were dealing with the problem on a "case by case basis".
The assembly heard that there was a possibility of using existing powers to improve disputes about responsibility for the plant.
This included the potential use of Anti-Social Behaviour Orders.
UUP MLA Robin Swann said he was dealing with several cases in his constituency.
Agriculture and Environment Minister Michelle McIlveen said a regional eradication programme would be "very costly", would not guarantee total removal of the plant and might create a public expectation that the authorities would intervene in similar nuisance species cases.
Michelle McIlveen cited an example of a case in which £2m had been spent getting rid of Japanese Knotweed on a single two-hectare development site.
Given that any treatment programme could last for seven years, it would have long term budget implications.
She said any strategy would have to be voluntary because there was no law in Northern Ireland compelling landowners to get rid of it.
