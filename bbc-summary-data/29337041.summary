Now, HBO has confirmed his co-star will be Vince Vaughn.
Eight episodes will be made with Farrell starring as a detective and Vaughn as a criminal.
First time around, Woody Harrelson and Matthew McConaughey took centre stage, earning them critical plaudits and award nominations.
That series focussed on the intense relationship between Harrelson and McConaughey's flawed but determined detectives.
Without revealing any spoilers, HBO has revealed some early details about series two.
It says the plot will revolve around three police officers and a career criminal who must "navigate a web of conspiracy in the aftermath of a murder".
Farrell plays Ray Velcoro who HBO describe as "a compromised detective whose allegiances are torn between his masters in a corrupt police department and the mobster who owns him".
As for Vaughn, he'll play Frank Semyon who is a "career criminal in danger of losing his empire when his move into legitimate enterprise is upended by the murder of a business partner".
And that's it.
There's no word on any appearances for Harrelson or McConaughey and no word on where the second series will be set.
Justin Lin, who's directed the last four Fast & Furious movies, will direct the first two episodes.
Production will begin later this year.
