Sinclair, 20, rejected a new Liverpool deal to join Watford on a five-year contract in June for a compensation fee of about £4m.
He scored his first Hornets goal in the FA Cup win over Burton on 7 January.
Polish centre-back Bielik, 19, joined Arsenal from Legia Warsaw for £2.4m in 2015 but has made just two appearances.
Both games came in EFL Cup ties against Championship opposition, the most recent a 4-0 win at Nottingham Forest in September.
