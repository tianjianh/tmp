US election 2016: Your daily dig from campaign trail

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
With just 25 days to go until Americans go to the polls, here's your daily election dig, including Donald Trump's angry response to "vicious" groping allegations and First Lady Michelle Obama's impassioned plea to voters.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Donald Trump and Michelle Obama have both taken to the stage to offer voters two different visions of America. Trump hit back against "vicious" groping allegations which he deemed "pure fiction" made by "horrible liars". He launched a scathing attack on mainstream media, saying he faces the "single greatest pile on in history" because he represents an "existential threat" to the political establishment. "This is a struggle for the survival of our nation," he said. He also threatened to sue the New York Times, which published two of the accusations. The newspaper said it would welcome the opportunity to make its case in court. Read the full transcript here.
Meanwhile, First Lady Michelle Obama condemned Mr Trump's "disgraceful" and "shocking and demeaning" remarks about women. "This wasn't just locker room banter, this was a powerful individual speaking freely and openly about sexually predatory behaviour," she said, adding the 2005 video had "shaken her to her core". "Leaders should meet a basic standard of human decency," she said.  "We need someone who truly cares about us and our children, someone with strength and compassion to lead this country forward."

Elsewhere, US Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton said she cannot recall key details about using a private email server while secretary of state, documents provided by her lawyer show. Conservative legal group Judicial Watch asked her for sworn responses to 25 written questions - at least 21 responses used variations of "does not recall".
Returning to the latest allegations against Donald Trump, the BBC's Katty Kay says they have prompted an important, long overdue, national conversation about the wider abuse of women - "something too many women have experienced in painful silence, and men for the most part are unaware". You can read her piece which tries to shine a light on the dark secret of sexual assault here.
Meanwhile, a left-leaning north Londoner describes what it's like to become one of Texas's most prominent Trump supporters, after a case of mistaken identity.
And in the weird world of social media, people have been imagining what the map of America would look like under different "if only" voting scenarios. What if only goats were allowed to vote? Or dogs? Or Simpson fans? BBC trending reports.
The fad comes a day after calls for women to be denied their right to vote have been trending after research by FiveThirtyEight suggested Donald Trump would win if only men could cast ballots next month. The Republican nominee's supporters were accused of tweeting #repealthe19th - a reference to the US constitutional amendment granting women's suffrage less than 100 years ago.
