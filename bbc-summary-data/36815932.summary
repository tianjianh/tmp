[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Sunderland and Italy winger Emanuele Giaccherini has joined Napoli on a three-year deal for an undisclosed fee.

Giaccherini, 31, joined the Black Cats in 2013 from Juventus for Â£6.5m but, after an impressive first season, he struggled to make an impact.
He played 43 times in total for the club, scoring five goals, but spent last season on loan at Serie A Bologna.
The Italian has 29 international caps and scored the Azzurri's opening goal of Euro 2016 against Belgium.
