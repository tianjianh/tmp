[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Police were alerted after the girl, 12, was approached on Norfolk Road in the Borras area at 08:15 GMT on Thursday.
The men were in a white box van which pulled up in front of the girl. One of the men is understood to have got out and made his way towards her.
The girl ran off and no contact was made.
Det Sgt Anne Louise Jones said: "This was clearly a distressing incident for the young girl and fortunately she came to no harm."
Wrexham council said the incident followed reports of attempts to abduct school children in Chirk and Oswestry.
Head of education, John Davies, said: "Head teachers have been advised to ensure staff are vigilant as pupils arrive at and leave schools and we also ask parents to ensure that children do not walk to and from school unaccompanied."
