The 32-year-old posted a picture of a letter sent to him on Twitter which warned him to leave France at the end of the season or face a grisly end.
The letter is addressed to Barton at Marseille's training ground, La Commanderie.
He spent almost the entire 2012-13 season in Ligue 1 with the south-coast club.
Barton jokingly refers to the letter, written in broken English, as "fan mail".
The undated, typed letter reads: "A little friendly advice: as soon as you finish your season in your current club, I advice you to leave France immediatly [sic].
"In fact, if you're not left France before June 1st, I will come to you specially Marseille smash your head shots baseball bat."
It goes on to describe how Barton's body will be found, using expletives.
A name and address for the purported sender is included on the letter, which is signed.
The footballer later tweeted: "Not sure what's more offensive, the grammar or the intent?"
He also posted a Google Maps image of the Paris address given on the letter, writing next to the picture of a block of flats: "By the way his gaff looks nice..."
The one-cap England midfielder left France following his one season at Marseille and has returned to favour at QPR.
He had previously been marginalised following his conduct and dismissal in the final game of the 2011-12 season at Manchester City, where he was sent off and subsequently received a 12-match ban.
