Rafael Benitez says he is agonising over whether to remain in charge of relegated Newcastle after his side finished their campaign with a remarkable 5-1 win over Tottenham.

Last week the Spaniard, who took over in March, said he had "positive" discussions with club chiefs.
"My heart is telling me yes, it is a great opportunity, city and club," the former Real Madrid boss told BBC Sport.
"But my brain is saying to analyse what is going on."
The Magpies, who will be in the Championship next season, produced arguably their best display of the campaign against a Tottenham side aiming to finish second.
Benitez's name was chanted by home fans throughout the game, as the players overwhelmed their more esteemed opponents. Newcastle also played with 10 men for the final quarter of the match after striker Aleksandar Mitrovic was sent off.
The 56-year-old manager, who has a relegation break clause in his contract, added: "I am really open to talking and see what happens.
"I have been in football all this time. You want to be sure people love you and if you work hard that they recognise that you are trying your best and I have this here.
"I knew that every day when I walk in the streets. Everyone is so positive and the atmosphere today doesn't surprise me too much. They were supporting for 90 minutes, I knew it would be like this and that is why I am so open to keep on talking."
