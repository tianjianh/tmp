'Badger baiting' claims: USPCA chief challenged over delay in reporting alleged cruelty

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The head of an animal charity has been challenged in court over a delay in reporting alleged animal cruelty to police until after a BBC broadcast.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Five men are on trial in connection with alleged badger baiting offences in County Down more than three years ago.
The chief executive of the Ulster Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals gave evidence in the trial.
Stephen Philpott said he had waited for almost a month before reporting an incident allegedly involving the men.
The accused include Belfast men John Alex Edward Francis Edens, 24, of Strandburn Drive, Darren Millar, 42, of Rainey Way, and Chris Kirkwood, 24, and Ryan Kirkwood, 23, both from Island Street.
Graham Arthur Officer, 44, of Rosepark, Donaghadee, also faces charges.
The defendants are accused of number of animal cruelty charges linked to alleged offences at farmland near Carrowdore in 2012.
Mr Philpott told Craigavon Magistrates' Court that a private security company had been hired by the charity he oversees to carry out surveillance work on the movements of a white van at Cardy Road near Carrowdore.
The court had previously heard that staff from the security firm observed men, with dogs, excavating ground.
Mr Philpott said he did not make a statement to police about the matter until almost one month later to facilitate the broadcast of a BBC News report containing filmed images from the surveillance.
He said the broadcast was part of a public awareness exercise and he "didn't want to jeopardise the BBC output".
He added: "I reported to police what I believed to be the destruction of a badger sett."
He was challenged by lawyers for the defence over his decision to delay reporting the alleged criminal activity to police.
A defence lawyer told Mr Philpott: "Surely it would have dawned on you that there would have been a criminal investigation."
The lawyer then asked Mr Philpott if he was more concerned with "celebrity" than the welfare of animals.
Mr Philpott said: "I am not concerned with any celebrity status in any way, shape or form."
After Mr Philpott was cross-examined about a decision to "humanely destroy" a healthy terrier dog found at the site, the judge said: "I have concerns about how a decision like that can be made by an organisation that has the welfare of animals at heart."
The trial also heard that the BBC has handed footage over to the court after initially resisting its request.
