The property, in Westcliff-on-Sea in Essex, was also "not for the faint hearted", the estate agent said.
It was put on the the market for £125,000 and went for £147,500.
Rob Kahl, of Scott & Stapleton estate agents, said:  "It was obvious what the condition was like, so I thought let's be a little bit different and not flower it up."
The owners, who live in another part of the UK, had decided to sell up after it was left in a poor condition by tenants.
The property description also advised viewers to "wipe your feet on the way out" and Mr Kahl wrote "I think there may even be some fleas there to keep me company when I carry out viewings".
He said: "We had to go round with the bailiffs and it was full of rubbish, the kitchen was interesting, the toilet was fun and games and there's no point putting it on the market with the normal script - people needed to be pre-warned.
"Nobody was surprised or disappointed - I like to think I was honest."
The flat, on St Helen's Road, had 25 viewings and 10 firm offers in the two days after it went on the market on Friday, the estate agent said.
They estimated that if it were cleaned and decorated it would be worth £170,000.
