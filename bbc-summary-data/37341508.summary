[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man accused of conspiring with his wife to kill a shop owner has admitted loading the victim's body into the boot of his car - but denies murder.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Tanveer Iqbal's body was found in Gul Nawaz's vehicle in Birmingham in February.
He is on trial for murder, along with his wife Zatoon Bibi, and a 16-year-old who cannot be named for legal reasons.
Giving evidence, Mr Narwaz, 44, said he woke up to find Mrs Bibi pushing a television box with the body in it.
He said he had no idea who the person in the box was and "no clue what was happening" but agreed to put the body in the car.
The prosecution claims Mrs Bibi, 37, had been in a relationship with Mr Iqbal.
The 33-year-old father-of-two was strangled before his body was crammed into a cardboard box.
It is alleged Mrs Bibi lured her former lover to her home in Bridgeburn Road, Birmingham, on 31 January, claiming she had birthday cake for him.
Birmingham Crown Court heard previously in the trial it was Mr Nawaz, of Roway Lane, Oldbury, who had killed Mr Iqbal.
Under cross examination, Gurdeep Garcha QC asked him about a moment in 2010 when he discovered Mr Iqbal had fathered a child with Mrs Bibi.
She said: "You had built up a seething resentment to him. By January 2016 you wanted him dead."
"Why would I want that?" he replied.
A 17-year-old girl denies perverting the course of justice.
The trial continues.
