Sgt Maj John Raynes of the Royal Field Artillery earned the medal for his efforts to rescue a wounded colleague at the Battle of Loos in October 1915.
He also helped rescue seven men buried in a bomb-damaged house after being pulled from the wreckage himself.
The plaque was unveiled during a ceremony at the Cenotaph in Sheffield.
A wreath was lain on Sgt Maj Raynes grave at Harehills Cemetery, in Leeds, at the same time.
Lord Mayor of Sheffield, Talib Hussain said: "It was incredibly moving to read about the heroism of this Sheffield man, who risked his life for others in circumstances that very few of us will ever have to endure."
Sgt Maj Raynes, who was born in Sheffield in 1887, served with Leeds City Police before and after the war, retiring from the force in 1926.
He died on 12 November, 1929 at his home in Chapeltown, Leeds, aged 42.
The plaque was provided by the government as part of a scheme to commemorate all the World War One recipients of the Victoria Cross.
