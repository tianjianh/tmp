[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
His three-year deal runs until 2016, but he will return home after the 2015 season with Wigan, his old Super League club, having first option to sign him.
Tomkins, England's leading try-scorer, joined NRL side NZ Warriors in 2013 for a world-record fee of about Â£700,000.
"I miss home in ways I never thought I would," said the 26-year-old.
"I never imagined it would reach this point.
"This is a great club and I can't say enough about the coaching staff. I love being with the lads and it's a brilliant country to live in."
Tomkins, who is recovering from a knee injury, added: "I'm truly grateful to the Warriors for agreeing to give me an early release and I am so determined to repay them for their consideration.
"All I want now is to get back out on the field to help us have a great season."
Voted Super League's Man of Steel in 2012, Tomkins scored 144 tries in 152 appearances for Wigan before moving to the NRL.
