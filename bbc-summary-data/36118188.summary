The Sky Blues led after Adam Armstrong's effort was deflected in by Marc-Antoine Fortune.
The Blades were 2-0 down after only eight minutes when Andy Rose poked in from a George Thomas through ball.
Billy Sharp's penalty gave the visitors hope, but Ruben Lameiras made sure of the points for the home side when he fired in from a Jodi Jones pass.
Coventry's first three-goal performance in 14 games helped them leapfrog the Blades into ninth, Tony Mowbray's men having now won three of their last four games.
After a late run of three wins from five matches had put them on the brink of the top six, the Blades can now no longer make the play-offs,
Sky Blues boss Tony Mowbray told BBC Coventry and Warwickshire:
"It was fitting for the season we have had at home, a good way to finish off.
"I told them to relax and play with a smile on their face. We started the game very brightly and it was great to finish as we did.
"It was good to score some goals, which has been our problem for the second half of the season, and good that we did it for the fans."
