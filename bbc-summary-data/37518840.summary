Luke Mossey: British Superbikes rider juggling racing with fatherhood

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Luke Mossey is riding high. He is in the top six, competing for the British Superbike Championship in the title showdown and has just become a dad.

His daughter was only born a few weeks ago while he was away at a race weekend, but the 24-year-old is already getting used to changing nappies and night-feeding.
"The same day my baby was born, I went in to the garage and told the lads nothing is going to ruin this day," Mossey told BBC Look East. "We got our best finish in the superbike class that day."
Despite the added responsibility of being a father, Mossey remains focused on racing and is well aware of its dangers.
"At the end of the day, it's my job. In a sport like this you are going to crash," he continued.
"When I come to a race weekend and put my helmet on I'm a motorbike racer. When I come home on Sunday night and during the week I'm a family man. It's a balance.
"There's a lot of pressure on a race weekend so it's nice to come home and chill out with my daughter now."
Mossey, nicknamed Skywalker, will be racing at the Assen TT circuit in the Netherlands this weekend but is not getting carried away.
He added: "Since we've qualified for the showdown, the pressure has been lifted. We haven't yet won a race in British Superbikes so that's the goal.
"I set myself a goal at the start of the year to make the Showdown. If we can get in the top two or three, I think that's a massive achievement."
