Helen Fleet, 66, was found dead in in Worlebury Woods near Weston-super-Mare, on 28 March 1987.
Despite a BBC Crimewatch appeal and a major police investigation, no one has ever been charged with her murder.
Police said there were "no new lines of enquiry" currently but believe answers "may lie in the local community".
Ms Fleet, who lived with her sister in Osborne Road, was last seen alive on the morning of her death.
Det Sgt Pete Frake said she had driven to the woods in her blue Datsun to take her two dogs for a walk.
"Helen was found beaten, strangled and stabbed in Worlebury Woods at around 12.40pm," he said.
"She was last seen alive at 10.50am in Worlebury Hill Road."
Despite thousands of people being interviewed by police at the time and further reviews of evidence, Det Sgt Frake said, the "horrific murder" had remained unsolved.
"Loyalties and relationships can change over the years, which can result in people being more willing to tell us what they know, or share with us any suspicions they may have," he said.
"Helen's friends and relatives have been waiting for 30 years to see justice done which is a heavy and unimaginable burden to bear."
Anyone with any information is being urged to contact Avon and Somerset Police.
