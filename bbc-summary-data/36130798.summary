Costello leaves the Irish Pro12 side a day after Johan Erasmus was appointed Munster director or rugby as part of a shake-up at the province.
He takes over as Green and Whites head coach following Martin Haag's appointment as England Under-20 boss.
"I've enjoyed a good time at Munster and felt it was time to get experience outside of Ireland," Costello said.
He spent six years with Munster, during which time he worked with the club's second team, academy and under-20s.
He also has previous director or rugby experience with amateur side UL Bohemians and led Munster A to the British and Irish Cup title during his time as head coach of the club's second-string side.
Nottingham finished seventh in England's second-tier competition, finishing outside the play-offs for a third successive season.
The 2015-16 season was the club's first full campaign at their Lady Bay Sports Ground training base, having left Meadow Lane Stadium with a capacity of nearly 20,000.
"What attracted me most was the outline, the plans and ambition of the club," Costello told BBC East Midlands Today. "But they are very realistic with where they want to go and how they want to build."
