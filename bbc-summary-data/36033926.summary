Eastleigh manager Chris Todd has urged his players to focus on their own results after moving within a point of the National League play-off places.

The Spitfires beat Barrow 3-1 on Tuesday to extend their unbeaten league run to eight matches.
Eastleigh have a game in hand on fifth-placed Tranmere, with four fixtures remaining in the regular season.
"You can't control other results. We have to keep concentrating on ourselves," Todd told BBC Radio Solent.
"You can only control your own games. It's hard not to look at the table, but you can't worry about it."
Eastleigh host fellow promotion chasers Tranmere in their final home game on 23 April and have taken four points from an available six from their last two games at Grimsby and against Barrow.
"We've got what we wanted from those games," said Todd. "The boys believe in themselves and they're really tight and working for each other."
