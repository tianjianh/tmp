Jackfield collapsed road reopens two weeks early

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Work to repair a collapsed road in Jackfield, Shropshire, has been completed two weeks early.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A hole measuring 3m sq (9 sq ft) and 1.3m (4ft) deep appeared in Ironbridge Road, last Boxing Day.
It was caused by workings in the underlying clay mines, weakening surrounding soils.
The road, rebuilt on top of a concrete slab held in place by 70 metal poles sunk into the ground, has been opened to traffic.
