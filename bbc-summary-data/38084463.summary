A 20-year-old woman is believed to have fallen and has been airlifted to hospital.
A man whose son found a handbag raised the alarm.
"My son and his friends were up jogging round the mountain and found a handbag and identification," he said.
"They started to look around and they saw a lady lying down the cliff.
"They climbed down the hill and found she was still alive. The alarm was then raised," he told the BBC.
