On 5 December 1766, young Scotsman James Christie opened the doors of his first sale house, in Pall Mall, London.
His first auction included a pair of sheets, two pillowcases, two chamber pots and four Indian glassworks.
The following year, he held his first of what would be many auctions devoted entirely to pictures.
Jussi Pylkkannen, global president of Christie's International, said its 21st Century auctioneers still have the expertise that enables them to "source outstanding collections and deliver extraordinary sales".
"Ever since James Christie first opened his doors 250 years ago, innovation and passion have driven our business, creating different perspectives of the art market and collecting trends," he said.
Here are 10 landmark sales from the auction house's illustrious past.
The Hamilton Palace sale of 1882 is described by Christie's as "one of the most important house sales of the 19th Century".
The auction took place over 17 days and included furniture made for Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette.
The collection sold for £4,620, which in today's money is about £415,000.
In 1927, a painting of James Christie was sold for 7,200 guineas - the equivalent of £403,000 today.
The 1788 portrait was by British painter Thomas Gainsborough, who was a close friend of the auctioneer.
In 1993, a blue plush-covered "Elliot" teddy bear, manufactured by Steiff in 1908, was auctioned.
It went for £49,500 - triple the pre-sale estimate.
In 1995, a gold-plated Royal Quiet de Luxe portable typewriter, owned by James Bond author Ian Fleming, came up for auction.
The typewriter, produced in 1952, sold for £55,750.
In 2002, the football shirt worn in the 1970 World Cup Final by Edson Arantes do Nascimento - otherwise known as Pelé - was sold at the London auction house.
The distinctive number 10 jersey fetched £157,750 - even though it was only estimated to fetch £30,000 to £50,000.
In 2006, Christie's New York auction house sold the Starship Enterprise-D from the 1987-94 television series Star Trek: The Next Generation.
It sold for $576,000, which was the equivalent to £307,600. (Exchange rates have changed since the Brexit vote.)
In 2009, a red and blue laced gold-lacquered Japanese suit of armour was sold at the same venue.
The Honkozane Nimai do Gusoku armour was from the early Edo period (1600-1868).
It fetched $602,500 - equivalent to £362,285.
In 2012, this RML Leyland AEC London Routemaster bus, made in 1966, was sold in London.
It was estimated to fetch up to £30,000, but eventually went for £67,250.
In July 2015, an imperial black felt bicorn campaign hat belonging to French Emperor Napoleon I was sold.
The hat, believed to date back to 1806, fetched £386,500.
In 2015, an Aquascutum royal blue wool crepe suit, worn by British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher in 1989, sold at the London auction house.
The fetching power suit fetched £27,500, smashing the pre-auction estimate of £2,000-£3,000.
