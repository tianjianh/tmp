Newtownabbey firm confirms 37 job losses

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The technology supplier Schlumberger has confirmed it will cut 37 jobs at its Newtownabbey plant.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The job losses reflect the downturn in the oil and gas sector and weakness in Northern Ireland manufacturing.
The Unite union has said it will engage with management to mitigate the losses and to secure the best possible redundancy offer.
It said Northern Ireland is "still reeling at large-scale job losses across the manufacturing sector".
