Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal has picked defender Luke Shaw in his Europa League squad to give him a target for his recovery.

Shaw broke his leg against PSV Eindhoven in September, and it is still not known when he will be fit.
The 20-year-old will not be available for the Europa League last-32 encounter with Midtjylland later this month, but Van Gaal has set a longer-term aim.
Van Gaal said: "He can play the final. That is a goal he has to live for."
This year's Europa League final will take place in Basel on 18 May.

Meanwhile, United midfielder Ander Herrera has dismissed suggestions that former Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho plays a negative brand of football.
Van Gaal has been criticised for his possession-based style of play, and Mourinho has been heavily linked with his job.
The Portuguese has been known for a pragmatic approach, but coached Real Madrid when they won the Spanish league in 2011-12, finishing with 100 points and 121 goals.
Speaking in Spain, Herrera said: "At Chelsea, Mourinho played with Cesc [Fabregas], Willian, Oscar, Hazard and Diego Costa.
"Is this not an attractive style? Or that of his Madrid scoring record in a year?
"Mourinho does not seem to me to be a defensive technician."
