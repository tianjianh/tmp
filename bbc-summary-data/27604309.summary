Jeremy Hunt agreed to review plans to switch from a consultant to midwife-led service at Northallerton's Friarage Hospital at the request of North Yorkshire County Council.
After an initial assessment, he said the proposals, which led to protests including a petition, should go ahead.
The council said the decision was "disappointing".

The proposals to overhaul children's and maternity services at the Friarage Hospital have been extremely controversial.
The local NHS believes that services there are unsustainable because there aren't sufficient patients to justify having a full range of consultants with the right skills around the clock.
They want to move overnight children's care and high risk births to other hospitals but this has been unpopular with campaigners who fear the loss of local core services and increased travel times.
North Yorkshire County Council finally referred the matter to the Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt, who today confirmed that the proposals should go ahead.
This should draw a line under a row that has been rumbling on for more than two years with the local Health and Scrutiny Committee now saying they will accept the decision.
The Hambleton, Richmondshire and Whitby Clinical Commissioning Group (CCG) said the change from consultant to midwife-led services was in the best interest of patients.
It means pregnant women or children with complicated medical conditions would have to use the James Cook University Hospital, located 22 miles (35km) away in Middlesbrough.
The plans, first announced in 2011, attracted strong opposition including a 10,000-signature petition and marches.
Mr Hunt had rejected a full review of the proposals in 2013 but agreed to refer it again to the Independent Reconfiguration Panel in April.
Panel chairman Lord Ribeiro said: "The quality of patient care has been our primary concern and after considering the matter carefully we believe these changes will ensure the best care for local women and children."
Councillor Jim Clark, chair of the Conservative-controlled county council's scrutiny of health committee, said he had been confident it had made a strong case for a full review.
"This decision will greatly disappoint all those mothers-to-be and families across Hambleton and Richmondshire who expressed their concerns over the proposals," he said.
Mr Clark said it was now clear the council had to accept the decision.
Vicky Pleydell, chief clinical officer at the CCG, said: "We hope that people who have had concerns about these plans will be reassured by the Secretary of State's decision based on independent clinical advice, and are now confident that this is absolutely the right thing to do.
"This change is supported by all of the local doctors and midwives and we know this will provide safer, better services for local mothers and children which will last into the future."
The changes will be implemented from October.
