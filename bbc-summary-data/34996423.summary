[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Leonard Hawkes, 69, from Berkshire, and Richard Westwood, 72, from Surrey, are alleged to have attacked the girl in a hotel after a gig in 1968.
Both men pleaded not guilty during a brief hearing at Chester Magistrates' Court.
They were ordered to appear before Chester Crown Court on 5 April.
Both were granted conditional bail.
Prosecuting, Rob Youds, said the complainant had been assaulted in a hotel room after she had attended a pop concert in Chester at some point between 1 and 30 April 1968.
The Tremeloes formed in 1958 and first charted in the UK in July 1963 with a version of Twist and Shout.
They had a string of hits throughout the 60s, including a number one with Silence Is Golden.
Guitarist and vocalist Rick Westwood left in 2012 and bass player and vocalist Len 'Chip' Hawkes, left in 1988.
