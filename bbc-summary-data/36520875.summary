Salford, who have also been charged for improper conduct, won the match 26-24.
However, after the game, winger Justin Carney and centre Junior S'au were pictured in heated exchanges with fans as they tried to protect their children in the crowd at John Smith's Stadium.
A flare was reportedly thrown in the Salford end moments before the trouble.
The Red Devils did apologise for the actions of their fans, while owner Marwan Koukash promised to act against the fans involved.
An independent tribunal will hear the case, with a hearing date set for either late June or July.
