Comments: Do you think you are addicted to tech?

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
As part of our new special, 'Is Tech taking Over?', we've been looking into how much we use technology, and what impact it's having on our lives.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Technology is everywhere, we use it to chat to our friends, play games and keep up to date with what's going on in the world.
We asked a group of 11-12 year olds if they thought they used their tech a bit too much.
See what they said.
Thank you for your comments. This chat page is now closed.
I think that I am addicted to tech - whenever I come home from school, I watch TV. When I start, I just can't stop!
Natalia, 10, Towbridge
Well yes, sadly. I even like playing video games on my console. But sometimes, I forget about what I was supposed to do, like doing the chores or even exercise.
Aidan, 16, Beckenham
I am addicted to tech it's really hard not to go on my phone.
Jessica, 15, London
I am on tech too much because I spend around five and a half hours on it everyday!!!
Natasha, 11, Birmingham
I'm definitely addicted to technology I'm ALWAYS on my iPad. So I would miss that the most if it got taken off me.
Lara, 11, Scotland
I wouldn't say I'm addicted, as my mum only lets me go on my electronics for two hours at the weekend and three hours Monday to Friday. I think it is important that kids learn about the outside world and not spending all their time on the latest games.
Sophie, 12, Surrey
I always go on my PC.
Kaitlin, 10, Elgin
I think I'm a bit addicted to tech because I'm always on my phone and it dies very quickly. At the minute, me and my friend are having time off any social media (e.g Snapchat and Instagram)
Shannon, 12, North West England
I'm not addicted to tech but I do spend most of my time on it
Fatima, 14, Scotland
I'd say I am and am not addicted as I spend time studying as much time as I spend on tech (which I like very much).
Josh, 10, Lowestoft
I am definitely addicted to technology. I always watch Family Guy and South Park on the TV or use my iPad to listen to music before school.
Archie, 13, England
Yes I am addicted to tech. I love it so much that I can't stop doing it. I play Minecraft on my Xbox One every weekend with my friends and I cannot stop playing.
Joseph, 13, Northamptonshire
I'm in the middle with addicted and not with tech because in the winter when it's cold I just sit with a blanket all nice and warm and watch movies and sit on my iPhone all day everyday. But in summer my phone gets really hot as it quite sunny so I put my phone away and go in my garden, because I love gymnastics. I practice gymnastics and go on my trampoline and do some tricks to entertain myself and have fun while It's hot. The world is tech addicted though - you walk down the street and nearly everyone is on a phone!
Molly, 11, Birmingham
Yes I am so addicted tech and I use it every day! I couldn't live without it.
Milly, 10, Dudley

I use social media sites a lot like Facebook which I use to keep in touch with my friends in England. I also like to go out a lot as I do swimming and yoga which I find helpful as it relaxes me.
Hope, 15, Aberfeldy
I don't think I'm addicted to tech: once I had to spend almost four months without my iPad and held up very well!
Sam, 13
I do not think I am addicted to tech. I love to read and draw and sing. I enjoy sports like football, tennis, and swimming (which I play at school and home). Technology has taken over our once beautiful planet. We must stop the gadgets and focus on creative or productive hobbies/activities.
