[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Leicester City have rejected a bid from Roma for winger Riyad Mahrez, manager Craig Shakespeare has confirmed.

The 26-year-old, who joined the Foxes from French club Le Havre in 2014, announced in May that he wanted to leave the club.
"The bid was politely declined because it was a low offer," said Shakespeare. "I don't know what it was and I don't get involved."
Mahrez, PFA player of the year in 2016, has reportedly been valued at £50m.
Shakespeare, who is with the Foxes in Hong Kong for a pre-season tournament, had said earlier this week there had been no bids for Mahrez.
The Algeria player made 48 appearances for Leicester last season.
He scored 10 goals and provided seven assists as Leicester recovered from a poor start to finish 12th in the Premier League and reach the Champions League quarter-finals.
BBC Radio Leicester's Ian Stringer:
There was talk 10 days ago that Roma had tabled a £20m bid and I'm not surprised it was rejected. Mahrez is box office and, in the current market, he's worth double that.
The Algerian is on a long-term contract and, although I'm sure he go, it will not be until the price is right.
Leicester have been exemplary in their handling of the situation so far and the aces are all in the hands of senior management at the King Power Stadium.
