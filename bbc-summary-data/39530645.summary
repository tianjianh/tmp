[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The image showed the two royals with members of the Privy Council after a meeting at Buckingham Palace in 1981.
It had a guide price of £1,000 but it was sold for £1,600 by Dominic Winter Auctioneers in Gloucestershire.
The frame is signed by George Thomas, 1st Viscount Tonypandy, who is pictured second on the right in the front row.
The meeting on 27 March 1981 marked the Queen giving Prince Charles consent to marry Princess Diana, who is not pictured, under the Royal Marriages Act.
Chris Albury, auctioneer and senior valuer, said it was the first time he had seen something signed by more than one member of the royal family.
