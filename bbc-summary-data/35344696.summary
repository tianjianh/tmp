The accident happened at about 12:30 GMT at The Old Fire Engine House in Ely, Cambridgeshire, on Sunday.
As reported in the Ely News, the impact completely destroyed a food preparation area which was empty at the time. The car driver was not injured.
Restaurant owner Ann Jarman said: "Staff thought a bomb had gone off."
"If anyone had been in the room at the time I think they would have been pretty badly injured. It's a miracle they weren't," she told the BBC.

The stainless steel work surfaces had been "pushed right to the back against the fridges and there was glass everywhere," Mrs Jarman added.
"I feel so sorry for the car driver. The family was coming in for a celebration lunch.
"Poor thing. She was trying to park and I think her foot just slipped."
The restaurant had to be closed but has now been boarded up and it was "business as usual" for customers, she said.
"Some lovely builders interrupted watching the Arsenal match to come straight over and help as we were open to the elements."
It was the first time - apart from Christmas - she and husband Michael had closed the restaurant, Mrs Jarman said.
Their insurance company was being "jolly helpful", she added.
