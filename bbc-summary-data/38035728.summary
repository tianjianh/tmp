Portsmouth 1-2 Stevenage

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Steven Schumacher and Matt Godden earned Stevenage their fourth successive away win as they beat promotion-chasing Portsmouth at Fratton Park.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Midfielder Schumacher notched his first League Two goal of the season and Godden doubled the lead as the visitors grabbed two goals in four second-half minutes, before Michael Smith set up a thrilling finale.
Pompey winger Kyle Bennett sliced a 25-yard snapshot against the post in the eighth minute, with the hosts keen to prolong a four-match unbeaten streak.
Godden blasted a shot straight at goalkeeper David Forde, who took it at the second attempt, before Bennett's header on the stretch was held by Jamie Jones at the other end in a poor opening 45 minutes.
Bennett caused more problems in the second half, with his fierce swerving drive forcing Jones to parry, and then substitute Conor Chaplin lashed over before the goal flurry.
Schumacher's powerful drive went under Forde from a Ben Kennedy centre in the 71st minute, before Godden capitalised on a poor clearance from the goalkeeper to slide home.
Smith set up a nervy finish when he lashed in his third of the week at the back post with 10 minutes to play.
Jack Whatmough nodded against the post with the last action of the game as Boro continued their excellent form on the road.
