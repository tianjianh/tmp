Shares worldwide have risen after the FBI said Hillary Clinton should not face criminal charges over her emails.
In the US, the S&P 500 index surged 2.2%, or 46.34 points, to 2,131.52.
On Friday, the index had closed lower for the ninth trading session in a row - its worst run since December 1980.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average soared 371 points to 18,259.60,  while the tech-heavy Nasdaq index jumped 119.8 points at 5,166.17.
"Investors are reacting this morning to moving the email controversy to the sidelines, but still looking at a race that is too close to call," Art Hogan, chief market strategist at Wunderlich Equity Capital Markets said.
