Independent councillors at Highland Council expect to formally set up a new ruling administration on Thursday.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Last month, the Lib Dems walked out of the SNP-led coalition that had run the local authority since 2012.
Following days of talks, the council's Independent group has taken steps to form a new administration.
The matter will be debated by councillors and be the subject of a vote at a special meeting in Inverness.
