Indonesian embassy officials met Siti Aisyah on Saturday in the Malaysian capital.
She said she was given the cash to smear Kim Jong-nam's face with "baby oil" as part of a reality show joke.
Tests show Mr Kim was killed with the highly toxic nerve agent VX.
It is classified as a weapon of mass destruction by the United Nations.

Mr Kim died last week after two women accosted him briefly in a check-in hall at a Kuala Lumpur airport.
There is widespread suspicion that North Korea was behind the attack, which it strongly denies.
Three people have been arrested for the murder, while at least seven other suspects are wanted by police, including four North Korean men.
After a 30-minute meeting with Siti Aisyah on Saturday, Indonesian Deputy Ambassador Andreano Erwin said: "She only said in general that somebody asked her to do this activity. She only said in general she met with some people who looked Japanese or Korean.
"According to her, that person gave her 400 ringgits to do this activity... She only said she was given a kind of oil, like baby oil."
The officials said they did not see any physical signs that the suspect had been affected by the chemical.
