Dominic Jackson, 35, was reported overdue after leaving for a weekend trip from Portsoy in Aberdeenshire.
His kayak was found near Lybster in Caithness. A body later found in the Lybster area was confirmed as his.
Mr Jackson's family have set up a charity to promote sea safety and the use of personal locator beacons (PLBs).
The campaign - called PLanB - has already raised thousands of pounds.
The statement said: "Sadly, Dom was most likely already dead before anyone even knew he was missing, an outcome which could have so easily been avoided had he been aware of and taken basic safety gear.
"Dom's family - father Jeremy, brothers Stuart and Leighton, sisters Kirstie, Kate and Ellie together with his large extended family and friends - have all undergone a tremendous ordeal and in the midst of their grief are determined that Dom's life will not have been lost in vain.
"A PLB can be bought as a present to a loved one, a gift to yourself or can even be hired if the costs of owning one are prohibitive."
Mr Jackson was originally from Uckfield in East Sussex but later moved to Fettercairn in Aberdeenshire.
