[SN]TITLE[SN]
Midfielder Alan Davidson quits Ballymena United for GAA

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Alan Davidson has left Ballymena United in order to concentrate on playing Gaelic football.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 26-year-old midfielder's contract was terminated by mutual consent three days before Ballymena take on holders Cliftonville in the League Cup final.
In a generous farewell Davidson donated his final month's wages to a charity of Ballymena's choice.
Mark McCullagh has also quit United, with the versatile player departing because of work commitments.
Davidson played for Newry City and Glenavon before moving to the Showgrounds in February 2012.
However, he was soon caught up in a registration row which denied Ballymena a spot in the Irish Cup semi-finals.
It was a dramatic first year at United for Davidson as he scored the winning penalty in a shoot-out success over Linfield in the Co Antrim Shield final.
Davidson helped the Sky Blues to last year's Irish Cup decider by scoring twice in the semi-final win over Queen's University.
