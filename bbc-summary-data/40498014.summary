The 29-year-old, who spent the second-half of last season on loan to St Mirren, has signed a two-year contract with the Bairns.
Loy previously played for Falkirk from 2013-15, netting 35 goals in 78 games.
"When I heard Falkirk were interested in bringing me back, there really was only one option. I can't wait to get started," Loy told the club website.
Loy started his career at Rangers and had loan spells at Dunfermline and St Mirren before joining Carlisle United in 2011. He then spent two years at Falkirk before switching to Dundee.
"I am thrilled to be able to bring a player of Rory's quality back to the club," manager Peter Houston said.
"I was disappointed to lose Rory two years ago so when it became apparent that he may well be available I was determined not to lose out and to bring him back."
