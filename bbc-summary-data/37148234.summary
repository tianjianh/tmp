George Hamilton: PSNI chief apologises over 'dry your eyes' tweet

The PSNI's chief constable has apologised to his officers after posting a tweet on Saturday that appeared to dismiss the pressure they are under.

On Sunday, the Police Federation called on George Hamilton to withdraw the "offensive" comments.
Its chairman Mark Lindsay said Mr Hamilton was "out of touch".
In Mr Hamilton's initial posts, he told a fellow Twitter user: "Dry your eyes, do the job or move on."
The Twitter user had challenged the chief constable's call for people to consider a career in policing, tweeting a picture of a historical recruitment advertisement and pointing out that it was now a more complex job than originally envisaged.
Mr Hamilton responded: "I know - more complex & challenging but we are here to serve so let's get on with it rather than wallowing in self-pity."
He responded to another tweet from the same user, which denied any self-pity, by saying: "Well you're allowed to leave & seek another job - nobody is asking you to stay. Dry your eyes, do the job or move on!"
On Sunday, Mr Hamilton posted a video on Twitter, saying: "Last night's frank Twitter conversation was what the police actually do, however such important issues are not best dealt with in the 140 characters of a tweet.
"I've clearly caused some offence in what I've said, and for that I apologise.
"You see, I'm hugely proud of the officers and staff who go out and serve the public every day.
"I want to encourage and support then and I accept that my comments last night would not have conveyed that support - for that, I'm sorry."
Speaking to the BBC, Mark Lindsay said the pressure PSNI officers endure is "nothing short of monstrous".
He added: "The chief constable knows the extent of the problem - we have highlighted it often enough - which makes his remarks all the more bewildering.
"It shows how out of touch he is with his own officers and that is deeply disappointing.
"We have thousands of days lost through a range of illnesses. We have officers grappling with psychological conditions because of the appalling things they have had to experience and witness.
"To cap it all, we have a chief constable who tells the men and women he commands that if they don't like it, they can leave and get another job."
Mr Lindsay said the chief constable had "got this badly wrong".
"To say to Officers to 'dry your eyes, do the job or move on' amounts to great insult and a stunning misjudgement," he said.
"He should apologise immediately for this outburst, withdraw the offensive comments and remove the tweet from his account.
"The job is tough enough without the chief constable showing such indifference. Better if he empathised more with the men and women who deliver policing at the 'coalface'.
"He has a chance to put this right. He should take that opportunity without delay."
The BBC requested an interview with Mr Hamilton but he declined the offer.
