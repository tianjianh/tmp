Hull City strikers Abel Hernandez and Will Keane will be "out for some time" after picking up injuries in the Tigers' 2-1 victory over Southampton.

The duo were forced off inside the first 25 minutes at the KCOM Stadium on Sunday and manager Mike Phelan said "the signs aren't very good".
Keane limped off with a knee injury while Hernandez has a groin problem - both will be assessed on Monday.
"Keane is the worst of the two, it's a case of wait and see," said Phelan.
"They are crazy injuries. There is no reason why, it's just the wrong place at the wrong time."
The injuries took some of the shine off Hull's first Premier League win since 20 August, a result that also spared them the ignominy of losing seven straight league games for the first time in 36 years.
Second-half goals from Robert Snodgrass and Michael Dawson cancelled out Charlie Austin's early penalty for Southampton as Hull signed off before the international break with three much-needed points.
"There's a bit of everything - relief and happiness and concern at the injuries," added Phelan.
"It's a time to enjoy the moment over the next few days and we will kick on again next Monday when everyone comes back."

Hull began the season with just 13 fit senior squad members, but the return to fitness of several players allied to six new signings late in the transfer window eased their plight.
However, they recently lost Andrew Robertson to a calf injury while fellow full-back Moses Odubajo has suffered a setback in his recovery from a knee injury and will miss a further six months.
With goalkeeper Allan McGregor and defender Alex Bruce still recovering from long-term injuries, the loss of Keane and last season's top scorer Hernandez leaves Hull with just 18 fit recognised senior players - three of those goalkeepers.
