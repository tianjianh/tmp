Luton Town boss Nathan Jones has said he was "very surprised" Carlisle United defender Michael Raynes' red card from Saturday's game was overturned.

Raynes was sent off for an apparent elbow on Hatters forward Danny Hylton.
"Carlisle are a very good side with very good players, an excellent manager who I had a drink with after. I have no problem whatsoever," said Jones.
"I have not changed my mind and I have watched it eight times. For me that's a red card."
He continued to BBC Three Counties Radio: "It makes no difference to me whether it was upheld or rescinded because we don't play Carlisle in the next three games.
"But I'm very surprised that was overturned, to say the least, without getting into any trouble. They must have a different angle to watch I watched or a different perspective on football."
However, the Cumbrians manager Keith Curle has said he understands why the red card from the 1-1 League Two draw was rescinded.
"We all watched the game, we saw the incident live as it happened and the video evidence that backed up Michael stood his ground and his eyes were firmly fixed on the ball," Curle told BBC Radio Cumbria.
"There was a coming together of players but if anything it was probably more their player throwing himself into Michael and then to the ground, rather than being struck."
