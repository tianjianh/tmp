The loaded pistol was uncovered on Monday after officers in Brisbane, Queensland, discovered a second handgun in his car.
A body search revealed the biker had the handgun "secreted between his buttocks", Queensland Police said.
He was charged with weapons and drug offences.
Police also searched his inner-city apartment where they discovered a Taser, explosives and drugs.
The man is scheduled to appear in Brisbane Magistrates' Court on 21 December.
Police allege he is connected to the outlaw Rebels gang. In Australia, motorcycle gang members are known as "bikies".
The Rebels are Australia's largest motorcycle gang and have been responsible for crimes including killings and dealing drugs.
Detective Superintendent Mick Niland said authorities were "relentlessly" targeting organised crime.
