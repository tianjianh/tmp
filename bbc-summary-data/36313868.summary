Wayne Hennessey is hoping to join a group of Welsh players celebrating a trophy ahead of Euro 2016.

Hennessey will line-up on Saturday as his Crystal Palace side face Manchester United in the FA Cup final at Wembley.
"It would be great if Wales have a Premier League winner with Andy King, myself and Joe Ledley with an FA Cup winners' medal and Gareth Bale with a Champions League medal," he said.
"That would be great for Welsh football ahead of the Euros."
The former Wolves keeper feels the team spirit at Palace is reminiscent of what Chris Coleman has created among the Wales squad, who are preparing for a first major tournament appearance in 58-years.
"I definitely don't mind the season being extended for the FA Cup final, it is every boys' dream to play in such a major cup final and important we bring that cup home," he said.
"Hopefully it will be good news for us, but for a Welshman to come this far, it's not everyone who can win the FA Cup final and to do so would be a major highlight for myself personally.
"We have fantastic team spirit with Palace and Wales and it all shows, Wales qualified for the Euros, Palace got the cup final, you don't do that without good team spirit.
"Chris Coleman has been in touch, he's been fantastic for us with Wales, it was always difficult for him to come in with the passing of Gary Speed, but he's done an amazing job."
After a season where he established himself as first choice at Selhurst Park, playing 37 times for the Eagles, Hennessey admits he is preparing for the biggest games of his life in great heart.
"Winning major trophies is always a good experience," he explained "It is the start of two incredible months, but I have to focus on the FA Cup final.
"I waited a long time to get into the Palace first team and it has been a good season for me personally."
Hennessey is not dreading the prospect of a penalty shoot-out at Wembley or in France, admitting it is a good situation for a goalkeeper who has done his preparation.
"Every goalkeeper is different; they have their own routines and targets for what they want to do in a shoot-out," he said.
"But I will get the homework from Crystal Palace, where players put the ball and where they have put the ball in the last five to ten years.  We will be doing our homework."
