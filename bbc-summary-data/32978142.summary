Peter Congdon, 67, a city councillor from Truro, Cornwall, has vowed to buy a new car with some of the winnings.
Mr Congdon also plans to take his family on holiday to Butlins at Minehead where he has been going for 40 years.
The widower, who has three children, 10 grandchildren and one great grandchild, has previously raised thousands of pounds for community groups.
In the run-up to buying the successful ticket on Wednesday, Mr Congdon had won three days in a row on the National Lottery Scratchcards.
He said: "It was definitely my lucky day."
Mr Congdon headed straight to the local Land Rover showroom to book a test drive and said he would buy new cars for all of his children.
"As for the family holiday, we've been going to Butlin's for 40 years so this year won't be any different," he said.
The winning numbers on Wednesday were 12, 27, 28, 39, 41 and 48. The ticket that won £13,538,113 was purchased at the Trelander Post Office and Premier in the Quadrant, Trelander, Truro.
Mr Congdon raised funds for the Trelander estate community centre which opened in 2009 and runs bingo sessions there three times a week.
Mr Congdon's family was awarded a five-figure sum in compensation from the Royal Cornwall Hospital Trust in 2011 after his wife Rosemary died from Clostridium difficile in 2008.
