Camperdown Wildlife Centre bear Comet dies aged 30

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A European Brown bear at Dundee's Camperdown Wildlife Centre has died aged 30 following a short illness.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Comet was diagnosed with a tumour in his abdomen last week and his condition deteriorated over the weekend.
Comet arrived at Camperdown from Edinburgh Zoo when he was 16 months old and was later joined by Star from the Highland Wildlife Park.
Zoo manager Aileen Whitelaw said Comet had been an "important ambassador" and would be sorely missed.
