Elections 2017 results: Who are the new metro mayors?

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Six new mayors have been elected to lead combined authorities in England. Who are they? What powers do they have? And what are they going to do in their new roles?

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Combined authorities are groups of councils working together to assume powers, devolved from central government, over matters such as transport, housing, planning, skills and economic development.
The areas which elected mayors were:
All of them have been granted a 30-year investment fund.
They are not intended to replace or take over from smaller councils. And their duties vary from area to area. For example, Greater Manchester's authority will have control over a £6bn health and social care budget, while Cambridgeshire and Peterborough and the Liverpool City Region will have powers over planning for health and social care.
The Greater Manchester mayor will also take over the powers of the region's elected Police and Crime Commissioner, Tony Lloyd.
