Police Scotland said they found debris strewn across both carriageways of the A1, south of Grantshouse, after responding to a call at 06:25.
The lorry driver and a passenger managed to clear the north-bound side of the road so officers could operate a one-way system.
A police spokeswoman said the road fully reopened at 09:00.
Lorry driver Garry Godsell said the bags had been strewn across about 200 yards (182m) of the road.
He said: "It happened before I got there. Some of the traffic was threading its way through the north bound side.
"The vehicle involved was in a lay-by and its green curtain had come off."
Traffic Scotland said the incident happened between the A6112 Grantshouse and the B6437 Auchencrow.
