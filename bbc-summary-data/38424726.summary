[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Scott Wilson scored the only goal two minutes after half-time at Meadow Park to help the Spitfires leapfrog their opponents and climb to eighth place in the table.
Wilson's goal came from a defensive mistake, with the 23-year-old striker seizing on an under-hit back pass and rounding Grant Smith.
Boreham Wood had grabbed a late equaliser in a 2-2 draw between the sides on Tuesday, but this time keeper Mark Childs came to Eastleigh's rescue with fine saves from Femi Ilesanmi and Bruno Andrade.
