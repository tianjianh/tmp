The man had gone to his door to challenge the group when they hurled bricks through the windows of the house in New Edinburgh Road, Uddingston.
He suffered serious injuries and was taken to Monklands Hospital where his condition is described as stable.
The gang escaped following the attack which took place at 23:00 on Friday.
It is not known how many men were involved or in which direction they made off.
No-one else was injured in the incident, while police said two other cars were damaged.
Appealing for witnesses, Det Con Christopher Norton, of Wishaw CID, said the men were believed to have entered the area in a white Ford Transit van.
He said: "This was a brazen and targeted attack which has resulted in one man being taken to hospital.
"No-one else was injured, however, local residents were left shocked by the nature of this violent incident.
"Windows were damaged, a car was set ablaze and the victim was left seriously injured as a result of the attack. It is imperative that we trace the men responsible.
"We have been assessing available CCTV and speaking to local residents. We understand that the men may have entered the area in a white Ford Transit van.
"Local residents and passing motorists will have witnessed or heard this disturbance. I would ask anyone with information to contact detectives at Wishaw."
