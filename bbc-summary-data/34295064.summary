The event in Newry, County Down, remembered the tens of thousands who died during the Irish Famine which took hold in 1845.
An official ceremony was held at the city's Albert Basin and culminated in the laying of wreaths.
A minute's silence was also held to remember the dead and those who emigrated.

Could thousands of lives have been saved?
The commemoration in Newry was led by the Irish minister for arts and heritage, Heather Humphreys, who said it was a "great honour" to be in the city to remember those who had lost their lives.
"One of the main reasons for the holding of the commemoration in a different location in each province is to highlight the devastating effects that the Great Famine had on people throughout the island," she said.
"The famine has undoubtedly been one of the most significant events in our history.
"The failure of the potato crop during the 1840s not only led to the enormous suffering and loss of life but also changed Ireland's demographic and cultural landscape, the effect of which can still be felt today.
"We remember all those who suffered as a result of the famine, regardless of their creed, political affiliation or nationality."
The first commemoration took place in Dublin in 2008 in recognition of the fact that the famine affected all parts of Ireland.
Since then, the location of the annual event has rotated in sequence between the four provinces.
Ms Humphreys said she was a "proud Ulster woman" and especially pleased that the event was being held in Northern Ireland for the first time.
The last time the event was held in the province of Ulster was in 2011 when it was held in Clones, County Monaghan.
During the ceremony, two poems written by local school children about the famine were read out.
Guests were also treated to musical performances and speeches.
Irish ministers were joined by representatives from the Stormont assembly, including Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness and Culture Minister Carál Ní Chuilín.
Mr McGuinness said it was an "important period of reflection for all of us".
"I think given the circumstances that we're seeing internationally throughout the world with the plight of the refugees, it brings it all home to us very eloquently how important it is for us, as people who have known suffering in the past, to contribute to the alleviating of the suffering of others."
A special plaque will be unveiled in Warrenpoint on Sunday to commemorate those who suffered.
Chairperson of Newry, Mourne and Down District Council Naomi Bailie said: "I hope our programme of events will serve as a fitting reminder of the devastation and loss experienced by millions of people in the years of the Great Irish Famine 1845-49 and beyond.
"No county was left unscathed when the potato crop failed and, for many of those who fled in search of a new life, their journeys began from the ports of Newry and Warrenpoint."
