Crosby-on-Eden School, near Carlisle, had to be stripped out and refurbished following the deluge in December when record-breaking amounts of rain fell in Cumbria.
Temporary cabins were put in place in the playground to house classes.
Head teacher Ayesha Weston welcomed the return of 100 school pupils to the original building earlier on Monday.
She told BBC Radio Cumbria: "We just pulled together as a community and as a school. The children and staff have been fantastic and we have made it.
"It was horrible, absolutely horrendous. Everything was ruined. The school was stripped back and rebuilt.
"It's been six months almost to the day since the floods hit."
Rainfall during Storm Desmond broke all previous UK records, with Honister in Cumbria receiving 341.4mm (13.4in) in the 24 hours between 4 and 5 December.
