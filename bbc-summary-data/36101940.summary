[SN]TITLE[SN]
Bangor debt case resolved in High Court

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Irish league side Bangor are no longer facing the threat of possible closure over alleged outstanding debts.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Championship One club was issued with winding-up proceedings in a dispute linked to the installation of a 3G pitch.
The petition was dismissed at Belfast High Court on Thursday after agreement was reached about paying a contractor.
The case against the Seasiders centred on work carried out at their re-branded Bangor Fuels Arena.
Further terms of the resolution remain confidential.
The club opened a new all-weather training surface at the Clandeboye Park ground in 2013.
It was hoped the pitch would generate additional revenue for a club that was founded in 1918 and who enjoyed Irish Cup success back in 1993.
Contractor TAL Civil Engineering brought the petition due to outstanding debts for its work on the project.
Following a two-week adjournment in the case the court heard that the two sides had reached agreement.
"As I understand it funds have been transferred to my client's account this morning," a lawyer representing the petitioner told Master Kelly.
Pressed further, she confirmed that a reduced figure had been agreed and the debt paid in full.
