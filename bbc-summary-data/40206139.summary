Scotland v Italy: Edoardo Gori to lead Azzurri in Sergio Parisse absence

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Scotland will face an Italy team missing captain Sergio Parisse and featuring two new caps in their first summer Test in Singapore on Saturday.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
With the talismanic Parisse rested for the Azzurri's tour, scrum-half Edoardo Gori - the only Italy player with more than 50 caps - leads the side.
Experienced New Zealander Dean Budd, who qualifies via residency, and hooker Luca Bigi win their first caps.
Glasgow's Leonardo Sarto is on the wing with Michele Campagnaro at centre.
Former Scotland Under-20 cap Tommaso Allan gets the nod over Carlo Canna at fly-half in an Italy side with an average age of 24 and containing seven players with less than 20 caps.
But after failing to win a match in this year's Six Nations Championship, coach Conor O'Shea is using their tour - which like Scotland's also includes Tests against Fiji and Australia - as a springboard for the future.
"Our guys don't get all the resources that others do, but we are making fundamental changes for the future and we have just brought in a conditioning coach," said the Irishman.
"Our goal is not to be winning World Cups, it is to change Italian rugby for the future.
"Scottish rugby has showed that if you make the right changes, you can make rapid strides and catch up very quickly. Our job this weekend is to put a little more pressure on Scotland and take our chances instead of missing them all."
Scotland flanker John Hardie has warned his side must avoid under-estimating the Italians, who they beat 29-0 in their final game of the Six Nations.
"They are going to be up for the game," said the open-side. "They have a strong set-piece, so we will be on a game there.
"They also have a new defence coach who might change things and I am sure Conor O'Shea has a few tricks up his sleeve. We will have to be careful and have full respect for them."
