Joanne Dennehy: Widow attacks triple killer's legal aid

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The widow of a man murdered by Joanne Dennehy has branded the decision to grant the triple killer legal aid "ludicrous".

Dennehy, 33, from Peterborough, is serving life for the murders of three men and the attempted murders of two dog walkers in 2013.
She has launched a High Court fight for improved prison conditions, challenging a decision keep her segregated.
Kevin Lee's widow Christina said giving her legal aid was an insult to victims.
The BBC revealed on Friday that Dennehy had been under the supervision of the probation service when she murdered her victims.
She is serving her sentence at HMP Bronzefield, where she had initially been segregated while on remand.
Earlier this week, the High Court was told her continued isolation leaves her "tearful and upset" and is a violation of her human rights.
But the prison argued she had been segregated over fears of a prison break by her and other inmates. The alleged plan involved cutting off an officer's finger "to deceive the biometric security system at the prison".
Cristina Lee told the BBC: "A ludicrous decision has been made in granting legal aid to her.
"It is a complete travesty that normal, hard working tax payers should have to fund this evil woman in her legal action.
"How can she quote human rights after what she has done? It is adding insult to injury to all her victims."
A Ministry of Justice spokesman confirmed Dennehy received legal aid.
"We robustly defend compensation claims as far as the evidence allows, and have successfully defended two-thirds of prisoner claims over the last three years," he said.
"Prisoners should not get legal aid unnecessarily, and we have already stopped funding for cases that can be dealt with through existing complaints processes."
Dennehy murdered Lukasz Slaboszewski, 31, Kevin Lee, 48, and John Chapman, 56, in March 2013 before dumping their bodies.
She went on the run and subsequently stabbed dog walkers Robin Bereza, 64, and 56-year-old John Rogers in Hereford.
