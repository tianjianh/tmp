Football's world governing body Fifa has lifted its suspension of Sudan.

The country was banned earlier this month following government interference in the sport.
However, the Sudanese government has now annulled the decision that prompted the ban.
"Under the circumstances, (Fifa) decided to lift the suspension with immediate effect," wrote Fifa Secretary General Fatma Samoura.
The lifting of the ban comes too late for Sudan's leading sides in African club competition - with Al Merreikh and Al Hilal disqualified from the Champions League because of the Fifa suspension.
Al Merreikh had been poised to reach the Champions League quarter-finals while Al Hilal Obeid, eliminated from the Confederation Cup, had already secured a last-eight place in that competition.
However, the nation will now be able to contest a forthcoming 2018 African Nations Championship (Chan) qualifier against Burundi.
Sudan earned its ban after the Ministry of Justice ordered the removal of Mutasim Gaafar Sir Elkhatim on 2 June as president of the country's FA (SFA) after two rival groups claimed control of the body.
The path to reintegration into Fifa came about when Sudan Prime Minister Bakri Hassan Salih issued a resolution overturning that decision on 7 July, so reinstating Elkhatim to his position.
Sudan's clubs were set to play between 07-09 July in African competitions but Fifa, in its letter, says it was only informed of the government U-turn on 10 July.
