The state trooper is in a critical condition and two others were taken to a hospital with non-life threatening injuries.
The Virginia State Police did not identify the male suspect.
Officers were conducting a training exercise when the gunman approached the trooper and shot him in the chest.
State troopers then fired back and killed the gunman. The troopers were in uniform at the time.
Najee Wilson, 18, of New Jersey was waiting for a bus when he heard gunshots.
"We heard a lot of people screaming," Mr Wilson told the Associated Press. "It definitely was a scary experience."
The Greyhound station in Richmond is just west of the city's downtown area.
Greyhound issued a statement Thursday afternoon saying the Richmond bus station would be closed "until further notice".
Police officers from multiple agencies flooded the area after the shooting. The gunman's weapon was recovered, police said.
Richmond Police Chief Alfred Durham said law enforcement officers have become targets.
"It's unfortunate these are the days we're living in, where folks want to harm law enforcement," Mr Durham said.
