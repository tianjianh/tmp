Bollywood star Salman Khan's fans are jubilant after a Mumbai court suspended his five-year jail sentence over a 2002 hit-and-run case, but others feel justice has been denied.

The Mumbai high court on Friday suspended Khan's sentence, pending his appeal. He was convicted on Wednesday by a lower court of culpable homicide.
In September 2002, Khan's car ran over five people sleeping on a Mumbai street, killing a homeless man and injuring four others. Khan claims he was not behind the wheels.
Khan is one of the most bankable stars in Bollywood with a huge fan base. He has appeared in more than 80 Hindi-language films.
Several of his films, including Dabangg, Ready, Bodyguard, Ek Tha Tiger, Maine Pyar Kiya and Hum Aap Ke Hain Kaun, have been huge commercial hits.
Indian TV news channels have showed the actor's fans cheering outside his house in Mumbai.
The actor's fans on Twitter were quick to welcome the decision.
Another user highlighted the fact that Khan has been involved in many charity efforts over the years.
Many, however, appeared critical of the court's decision, saying that the poor in India do not get legal processing with such speed.
Some users have also questioned how the court suspended Khan's sentence so quickly when it took 13 years for a lower court to declare him guilty.
Many others have expressed disappointment at the court's decision, calling it a "sad day" for Indian judiciary.
