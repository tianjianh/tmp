[SN]TITLE[SN]
WW1 Christmas truce is re-enacted by Welsh and German soldiers

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Welsh and German soldiers have re-enacted the unofficial truce held on Christmas Day during World War One.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The event on the French-Belgian border commemorated the troops who met in no-man's-land in 1914.
The grandsons of the commanding officers of the Welsh and German troops were also present and exchanged beer and plum pudding.
Teams from the 1st Royal Welsh and German Army later played a football match.
On 25 December 1914, soldiers on both sides at Frelinghien, about two miles from the Belgian border, climbed out of their trenches and exchanged cigars and souvenirs.
Royal Welsh soldiers were also at the opening of a new exhibition on the Christmas truce.
It remembers the time 100 years ago when, along parts of the Western Front, some men emerged from their trenches.
Although first-hand testimonies suggest there was no single organised football match between German and British sides, small-scale kick-abouts were held between soldiers.
There was no official truce, however, and along other parts of the frontline bloody battles continued to take place over the Christmas period.
A multi-faith service is also being held on Sunday in Frelinghien, led by the Reverend Clive Hughes from the Church in Wales and the padre of the Royal Welsh.
