Short yellow lines in Bristol dubbed 'ludicrous'

A set of double yellow lines less than a metre long in Bristol has been criticised as "ludicrous".

The lines on Leigh Road - part of the Clifton East residents' parking scheme - were highlighted by the Bristol Post.
The scheme was introduced by elected mayor George Ferguson and has divided public opinion.
Campaigner Michael Owen said the lines were "over the top" while the council said the lines were there to ensure vehicles did not park unsafely.
Michael Owen, who is against the parking zone, tweeted a picture of a toy racing car alongside the short section of lines.
He told BBC News he thought the markings "were completely over the top".
"It would be virtually impossible to park anything in the space - it's even too small for a Smart car.
"It's really ludicrous and so bureaucratic and just another foul-up from the council."
Clifton East is the latest zone to be rolled out as part of Mr Ferguson's city-wide plan to stop commuter parking. It is due to go live on 1 June.
Those in favour believe the measures will make it easier to park outside their home.
A Bristol City Council spokeswoman said the lines would make sure "appropriate access for emergency services, refuse lorries and delivery vehicles and give residents enough space to get in and out of driveways and garages".
"Our intention is to always optimise the available parking capacity in RPS areas," she added.
"Double yellow lines are installed at locations where parked vehicles would either cause an obstruction or would make the road unsafe."
Last April, Clifton traders drove a tank through the area protesting at the "lack of consultation" and handed in a 5,000-name petition.
Then in September, a number of major employers including the university and a hospital trust called for a rethink of the city-wide parking zone.
