Will Smith has revealed he is planning a musical comeback, including a new album and his first ever world tour with sidekick DJ Jazzy Jeff next year.

It comes after he surprised fans last week by rapping on a remix of Fiesta by Colombian band Bomba Estereo.
Smith told Beats 1 DJ Zane Lowe he has recorded more than 30 songs, with "six or seven that I really, really like".
The actor and rapper admitted he is "terrified" about making his first new album since 2005's Lost and Found.
"When you've had a certain amount of success, it seems like it should breed confidence," explained Smith.
"But it actually doesn't. When you win a lot, you lose the ability to lose. You're not allowed to lose anymore."
He added: "You actually lose the ability to create. The reckless abandon - and it's something I'm actually getting back from watching my kids, they really don't care - that kind of reckless abandon and that lack of fear.
"Not trying to live up to a legacy or anything like that, that gives you freedom," he said.
Smith said he had learned how to be happy to fail, adding that his film After Earth - which co-starred son Jaden Smith - was "a thoroughly and completely accepted failure."
"You have to fail a lot," he said, "you have to fail early. You have to fail often. And you have to fail forward. So I'm trying to get comfortable getting back to failing."
Smith told Lowe his recent collaboration with Bomba Estereo, which sees him rapping in both Spanish and English, had helped him by "shaking the rust off, knocking the dust off".
He revealed he has been in the studio "every day" between filming on forthcoming blockbuster Suicide Squad, including working with several unnamed collaborators.
"I'm really inspired and right now creatively my only struggles are figuring a way to say the things I want to say in a way that is still inspiring," said Smith.
"I'm just trying to still find that voice. I have so many things that I want to say, I'm struggling with saying them in a way that fits the flavour of music that I tend to like."
Also known as The Fresh Prince, the rapper said he is "pretty certain" he and former sidekick DJ Jazzy Jeff will take on the largest tour of their career together in 2016.
"Jeff and I actually have never done a full tour. I'm terrified," he admitted. "We've had a week run here, two weeks there. I'm really ready man."
