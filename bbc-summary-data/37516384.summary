Pro12: Treviso v Scarlets (Sat)

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Wales tight-head Samson Lee will make his first appearance of the season in Scarlets' Pro12 trip to Treviso.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Lee has not played for the region since April, having been injured on Wales' summer tour of New Zealand.
Scott Williams will make his 100th appearance for the region while DTH van der Merwe's return on the wing means Liam Williams moves to full-back.
Scarlets beat Connacht in their last outing, while Treviso were 27-11 winners against Newport Gwent Dragons.
Scarlets head coach Wayne Pivac had the trip to Treviso marked down as a tough assignment even before the Italian team's impressive win against Newport Gwent Dragons last week.
"We've won all our games in Italy in the past we haven't won them comfortably," he said.
"They really focus on their home games. There's a lot of travel involved and different conditions - it's warmer and humid, things we don't normal run into. They are a definite threat.
"They've got a new coach and they are moving a lot more ball and they have a big kicking game. We have to be clever."
Form guide: Scarlets registered their first points of the season thanks to 17-8 win over Connacht last Saturday while Treviso bounced back from their hammering by Ospreys to beat Newport Gwent Dragons 27-11.
Historically, Scarlets lead the series against Treviso 8-4, but the Italian team have won their last three meetings with Welsh regions.
