The 24-year-old DR Congo international has agreed a three-year deal at Craven Cottage, with the club having an option to extend it by a further 12 months.
Kebano joined Genk last summer following spells with Paris St-Germain and Charleroi.
He represented France from Under-17 to Under-20 level before making his full debut for DR Congo in 2014.
Kebano is Fulham's 11th signing of the summer transfer window.
Meanwhile, the Whites have terminated the contract of defender Nikolay Bodurov by mutual consent.
The 30-year-old Bulgaria international made 49 appearances during two years with the west London club but finished last season on loan at Danish side FC Midtjylland.
