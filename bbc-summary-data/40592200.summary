Det Ch Insp Chris Mallett, from the West Midlands Police homicide team, said: "Although we have made two arrests we are still asking people to come forward with any information they have, no matter how insignificant it may seem."
Mr Brindley, described by his parents as "a very straightforward and trusting person", was stabbed in the heart.
