A 37-year-old man was unhurt after the parked Ford Transit van he was in was targeted in Priesthill's Neilston Avenue at about 18:45 on 27 January.
People were being questioned from 18:30 in Neilston Avenue and Glenmuir Drive.
Officers were at Stewart Road, near Rouken Glen Golf Club, where a car was found, from 19:30.
Police revealed that the burned out Volkswagen Passat, involved in the incident, and found at the gold club entrance, had been stolen in Glasgow last August.
Following a forensic examination of the car, police said "a number of items" were being "submitted for further examination".
Inquiries have also revealed that a light-coloured 4x4 vehicle, possibly a jeep, was seen driving off from near the golf club shortly after the Volkswagen Passat was set alight.
It turned left up Stewarton Road towards Newton Mearns.
Officers want to trace the occupant, or occupants, of the vehicle, which could be silver, white or cream in colour.
Det Insp Greig Wilkie, of Police Scotland, said: "We are still trying to establish a motive for this incident and we're very keen to speak to the occupants of the 4x4 vehicle seen driving off minutes after the VW Passat was set alight.
"The purpose of the operation is to gather further information, perhaps jogging someone's memory which will enable officers to obtain further detail which could assist the investigation."
