[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Meet Singh Kapoor, 40, was found dead at Tilbury docks in Essex last August.
Timothy Murphy, 33, of Elmgrove in Londonderry, Northern Ireland, was cleared at Basildon Crown Court.
Taha Sharif, 38, of High Cross Road, Tottenham, was convicted last week. The jury has yet to decide on two other men.
The four all pleaded not guilty to conspiracy to facilitate illegal entry into the UK.
The two still to be decided upon are Stephen McLaughlin, 34, of Limavady in Londonderry, and Martin McGlinchey, 47, of Derryloughan Road in Coalisland, County Tyrone.
During the trial jurors were told the migrants were found distressed and in cramped conditions.
The group of Afghan Sikh migrants, which included 15 children, arrived in the UK on a ship from Belgium on 16 August, 2014. They are believed to have fled Afghanistan after suffering persecution.
All of the immigrants are now claiming asylum in the UK, the court heard.
