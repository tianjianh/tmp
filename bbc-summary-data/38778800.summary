Nottingham Forest 2-1 Aston Villa

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Teenage striker Ben Brereton's late goal earned Nottingham Forest a hard-fought win over 10-man Aston Villa.

Villa took the lead when Jonathan Kodjia curled a first-time shot into the corner from the edge of the box.
But Jamie Ward's shot was spilled by keeper Sam Johnstone, allowing Britt Assombalonga to tap in the equaliser.
Jack Grealish was sent off for a second yellow card, before 17-year-old Brereton fired in from Assombalonga's header down to win it for Forest.
Grealish's dismissal changed the momentum of a second half which Villa had controlled, with Forest keeper Stephen Henderson saving Scott Hogan's low shot before reacting brilliantly to deny Tommy Elphick's flicked shot from a Conor Hourihane free-kick.
The 21-year-old's second yellow card came for a mistimed challenge on Eric Lichaj, having already been booked in the first half for petulantly kicking the ball away.
Hogan was making his first appearance for Steve Bruce's side since signing from Brentford in a Â£12m deal, but he was overshadowed by Brereton's late contribution, who made his senior debut against Rotherham four days earlier.
His goal adds to a poor run of results for Villa away from home, as they have won only two games on their travels this season.
The result lifts Forest up to 15th in the table after a third win in four games under interim manager Gary Brazil, with their opponents one place above them in 14th.
Nottingham Forest interim manager Gary Brazil on match-winner Ben Brereton: "The young lad got a chance and, bless his heart, he took it.
"It is lovely that we had a young player coming on to score his first league goal - and he will get a lot of goals for this club.
"I am not worried about the age of the player, I am worried about the quality he will give us. We know what he will give us when he comes on the pitch.
"He was really good at retaining possession, he was playing with his back to goal - he was just bright. He has a lot to do, but he wants to learn and he wants to get better."
Aston Villa manager Steve Bruce: "I am distraught for everyone. The players have to stick at it. It is tough at the moment, but this is where you earn your money.
"We have to roll up our sleeves and keep working on the training ground. We were much better in this game than against Brentford and we have brought new players into the squad now.
"We will turn this around and see if we can put some back-to-back wins together, which will take us to where we want to be."
