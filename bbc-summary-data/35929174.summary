Republic of Ireland and Newcastle goalkeeper Rob Elliot will miss Euro 2016 this summer after being ruled out for a "number of months".

Elliot, 29, suffered a serious knee injury during the Republic's 2-2 friendly draw with Slovakia on Tuesday.
"There was a wave of emotion knowing I'd miss the rest of the season with Newcastle and the Euros with Ireland," Elliot told his club's website.
The relegation-threatened Magpies were already missing keeper Tim Krul.
Krul, 27, was ruled out for the rest of the season after injuring a knee in October.
Elliot has since made 21 Premier League appearances.
"Regrettably, the severity of this injury will rule Rob out for a number of months," said a Newcastle statement, which explained Elliot had damaged an anterior cruciate ligament.

Elliot said: "When I found out it was my cruciate ligament, that's when the tears came.
"It's nice to know that there are so many good people wishing me well at such a dark time."
Newcastle manager Rafael Benitez must now choose between Karl Darlow and 19-year-old Freddie Woodman for Saturday's match at fellow strugglers Norwich City.
Darlow, 25, has made just one Premier League appearance for the Magpies, while Woodman is yet to make his first-team debut.
Newcastle are 19th in the table, three points from safety with eight games remaining.
West Ham's Darren Randolph, 28, came off the bench to replace Elliot on Tuesday.
Republic manager Martin O'Neill could recall Shay Given, who has recently returned to training after a knee injury.
The Stoke keeper, who will be 40 on 20 April, was working as a television pundit at Tuesday's game and spoke to O'Neill about his recovery.
