Rangers chairman Dave King has pledged to invest all of the club's season ticket revenue into the playing squad.

Almost 35,000 fans have so far renewed, with the club hoping to improve on the 43,000 sold last season.
That would raise more than Â£11m, and King says the money will be spent on recruitment.
"All of our season ticket money will be invested in the squad as we work towards taking our club back to the top," King said on the club website.
The chairman is one of several directors and shareholders who have committed to providing further investment as the club approaches its second season back in the top flight.
Manager Pedro Caixinha faces a summer of rebuilding, having succeeded Mark Warburton in February with the club falling significantly behind champions Celtic in the Premiership.
Aberdeen, who won 2-1 at Ibrox on Wednesday night, have secured the runners-up place, but Rangers will finish third and play in the Europa League qualifiers in the summer.
"The team didn't perform to expectation this season but it is important to remember that some targets have been met," King said.
"In particular, getting back into European competition was one of our non-negotiables for this season.
"We are now back on that stage and looking forward immensely to the Europa League qualifiers and our ongoing involvement in Europe in the years to come.
"Pedro Caixinha and his backroom team have been assessing the squad since having arrived at Rangers, and will make the necessary changes in the summer so that we are as well prepared as possible for the qualifiers and the new season.
"The fact that we have already reached almost 35,000 renewals - against what has been a backdrop of transition and managerial change - demonstrates the terrific fan base that we have.
"They are appreciated all over the world for the way they have stood by the club in the past five years. On behalf of the board and staff I thank every one of them. I can only marvel at the steadfast loyalty of our supporters."
