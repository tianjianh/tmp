Carlos Carvalhal insisted Fernando Forestieri missed Sheffield Wednesday's 1-1 draw at Preston because of an injury and could return against Wolves.

Forestieri, 26, refused to play against Norwich in August after being linked with a move from Hillsborough.
Carvalhal accepted that the player's absence just before the transfer window would trigger speculation.
But the Owls boss told BBC Radio Sheffield: "It is an injury - 100%. I can guarantee it."
Wednesday struggled without the Italian, but Adam Reach's injury-time equaliser rescued a point for them at Deepdale.
Carvalhal said Forestieri would be assessed in training ahead of Wolves' visit on Monday.
"There was no chance to play today. We have some wish of a recovery for Monday," he added.
"He had pain after the game against Newcastle and tried to recover but it was impossible.
"We wish to have a good answer in training and that he can recover for Monday. It is important he does."
