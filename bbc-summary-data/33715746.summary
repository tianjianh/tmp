Derek Serpell-Morris, who is well known in the city, was last seen at the Commercial Rooms in Corn Street.
His family has organised a search party to retrace his steps. The search started at 11:00 BST.
DJ Derek is known to thousands of people and has played hundreds of sets at local clubs and pubs, as well as at the Glastonbury festival.
Earlier this week police confirmed his bank account has not been used since the beginning of July, and that he does not have a current passport and has "definitely not gone abroad".
The former accountant, a resident of St Pauls in Bristol since 1978, has played numerous gigs across the UK and appeared at the Big Chill.
He also released his own compilation album, worked with Massive Attack and appeared in a Dizzee Rascal video.
