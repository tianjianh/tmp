[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Thames Valley Police said officers went to Allen Close, Bletchley, on Friday night, but left after finding "no altercation in progress".
But at just after midnight on Saturday they were told a 55-year-old man had been taken to hospital. He later died.
A 50-year-old arrested man will face no further action, police said.
A post-mortem examination has not established a cause of death and it remains unexplained, a spokesman added.
The force said it had notified the Independent Police Complaints Commission over its handling of the case.
