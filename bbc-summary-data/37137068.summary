Maguire is tied for 24th place on level par after a three-over 74 which included two birdies on the front nine and five bogeys on the inward nine.
Meadow, 24, posted a level-par 71 to remain one over in equal 24th position.
South Korean Inbee Park leads on 11 under. Lydia Ko of New Zealand and the USA's Genna Piller are two behind.
China's Shanshan Feng is a further shot adrift on eight under.
Northern Irishwoman Meadow began round three with a bogey at the first, but was boosted by four consecutive birdies from the fourth to the seventh holes.
A double bogey at the eighth was a major setback for the County Antrim golfer and two further dropped shots and a birdie followed in her second nine.
Cavan woman Maguire, 21, and Meadow had carded impressive rounds of 65 and 66 respectively in their second rounds on Thursday to move up the leaderboard.
Maguire finished top amateur at the recent British Open when she shared 25th place.
Meadow, 24, finished third in the US Women's Open in her first season as a professional in 2014 but has struggled over the last 18 months.
The death of her father from cancer last year was a devastating blow for the Ulsterwoman and she has dropped to 473rd in the world rankings.
Meadow was a late inclusion in the Olympic field after the Dutch pair Anne Van Dam and Christel Boeljon were withdrawn from the 60-strong field for not meeting their country's qualifying criteria of being in the world's top 100.
