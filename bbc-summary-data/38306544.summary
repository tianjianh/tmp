O'Sullivan was 2-0 up against his fellow Englishman, but Selt hit back with a break of 82 to take the third before tying at 2-2.
However, five-time world champion O'Sullivan won the next two frames.
English duo Jimmy White and Ali Carter, plus Northern Ireland's Joe Swail, were among the others to progress on Tuesday at Glasgow's Emirates Arena.
Veteran White never looked back after an opening break of 133 against Welshman David John and won 4-0.
Carter found himself two frames down to Thailand's Thepchaiya Un-Nooh but took the next four frames.
Swail had two breaks of 80 and one of 87 as he overcame Lee Walker 4-1, with the Welshman also achieving 115 to take the third frame of a high-scoring game.
Nigel Bond, the 1995 World Championship runner-up, made an early exit, losing 4-0 to fellow Englishman Chris Wakelin.
Englishman Stuart Carrington produced breaks of 50 and 51 in the final frame to edge out Thailand's Kritsanut Lertsattayathorn 4-3.
The latest event in the Home Nations Series, the tournament is the first World Snooker ranking event held in Scotland since the World Open in 2010.
