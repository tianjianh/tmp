John Anderson's century helps Merrion beat Waringstown in Irish Senior Cup Final

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
John Anderson's century helped Merrion earn revenge for last year's final defeat as they beat Waringstown by 51 runs in the Irish Senior Cup decider.

Anderson hit 109 with Dom Joyce contributing 67 as Merrion notched a formidable 252-9 at Castle Avenue.
Waringstown were only able to post 196 in reply with Lee Nelson top-scoring with 48.
Anderson and Joyce put on 108 for the second wicket in Merrion's innings in the game's pivotal partnership.
Joyce and Anderson safely negotiated probing opening spells from former Irish international Phil Eaglestone (3-57) and South African professional Cobus Pienaar (2-39), to build the platform for what would be a match-winning total.
"We were a bit slow at the start but I just knew I had to bat for 50 overs and we'd have a decent score as I would be able to accelerate as the innings went on," said Anderson.
"The margin of the win was more comfortable than I expected but the bowlers did a super job and were backed up by the fielding throughout."
Waringstown's run chase never really got going, getting bogged down for long periods by a Merrion attack which never relinquished their stranglehold on the game.
Skipper Lee Nelson (48) and Greg Thompson (20) threatened briefly with a stand of 52, but with the required run rate steadily increasing, Merrion always held the upper hand.
Fifteen-year-old Max Neville set the tone with a magnificent opening spell, conceding just 12 runs in his seven over spell - as well as taking the crucial wicket of Pienaar - while former Ireland star Dave Langford-Smith crucially dismissed both Nelson and Thompson.
