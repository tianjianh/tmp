The west London side, who face Reading on Saturday, are two places above the Championship drop zone after winning just three of their last 20 matches.
But Jokanovic, who took over in December, told BBC Radio London: "I am sure we are not going to be relegated.
"I am not making any calculation about points needed to stay up. I am only thinking about what is in front of us and in front of us is Reading."
Meanwhile, goalkeeper Marcus Bettinelli is close to returning to the squad after a long-term knee injury.
The 23-year-old, sidelined since August, has played in two recent matches for Fulham's Under-21 side.
And striker Cauley Woodrow is also back in training following a foot injury he suffered against Sheffield Wednesday in January.
