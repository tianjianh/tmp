A World War Two veteran said he was "surprised" to be presented with an anniversary medal from the Russian government after more than 70 years.

Nelson Foyle received the commemorative medal for serving on the Arctic convoys which were attacked by German submarines, aircraft and warships.
Mr Foyle, from Netheravon in Wiltshire, was presented with the Arctic Star medal in 2013.
"This one was a big surprise - I never thought I'd get this," he said.
"I'm going to need a bigger box to keep them all in or a bigger wall."
A team from the Russian Embassy is currently racing around the UK to honour as many Arctic convoy mariners as possible.
As well as the commemorative medal the team is presenting the Ushakov Medal - one of Russia's highest honours for naval personnel - to the veterans.
The convoys - which delivered Allied supplies to the Russians along the most direct route - were described as "the worst journey in the world" by Winston Churchill.
Between August 1941 and 1945, a total of 78 convoys travelled to and from northern Russia.
They took four million tonnes of supplies which were used by Soviet forces fighting against Germany, including more than 7,000 planes and 5,000 tanks.
After Germany invaded the Soviet Union on 22 June 1941, Stalin demanded help and the western Allies provided supplies.
The most direct route was by sea, around northern Norway to the Soviet ports of Murmansk and Archangel.
The route was very dangerous, especially in winter when the ice spread further south.
Many of the convoys were attacked by German submarines, aircraft and warships.
Conditions were among the worst faced by any Allied sailors. Over four million tons of supplies were delivered to the Russians.

"We came back off the convoys and went to the Middle East and I finished up in Singapore when we had the surrender to the British," said Mr Foyle.
"I'd love to go back to Russia again - they were a great ally to the people they served with.
"I think they're very proud of us."
