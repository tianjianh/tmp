Derbyshire-born actor Robert Lindsay has been granted the Freedom of the Borough of Erewash in recognition of his achievements on stage, TV and film.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 66-year-old, who was born in Ilkeston, said his parents "would have been delighted".
Councillor Chris Corbett, Leader of Erewash Borough Council, said: "This is a well deserved honour."
Mr Lindsay is known for his role in TV shows such as, Citizen Smith and My Family, as well as stage work.
This has included appearances with the Royal Shakespeare Company and in musical theatre.
The recipient of a BAFTA, a Tony Award, and three Olivier Awards, he said his childhood in Ilkeston "remains strong" in his memory.
Danny Corns, who put forward the idea, said: "I've known Robert about 35 to 40 years, he went to the same school as me.
"I first saw him at 12 years of age in a school play... It was obvious that he had a lot of talent."
Councillor Corbett said: "He is one of Britain's best-loved and best-known actors and it is with great pride that we can say he is 'one of ours', he is from our borough.
"We thank those who organised and signed the petition asking us to award this Freedom of the Borough."
Mr Lindsay becomes the second individual to receive the honour after cycling boss Dave Brailsford, who was awarded it in 2012.
Recipients are presented with a ribboned Badge of Office medal and an ornate framed scroll.
