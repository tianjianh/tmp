Lukaku, 23, scored twice in a 4-0 win over Hull to help his side go level on points with fifth-placed Arsenal days after turning down a new contract.
The Belgian is the Premier League's leading scorer with 21 goals.
"You need to have hope in life. The fans love Romelu Lukaku and everyone loves Rom," said Koeman afterwards.
Former Chelsea player Lukaku has turned down the most lucrative contract offer in Everton's history.
The Toffees had been confident the Belgium international would sign a new five-year deal thought to be worth around £140,000 a week.
Everton fans roared when Lukaku's name was read out at Goodison Park on Saturday.
The hosts were leading 2-0 when Lukaku struck twice in added time to seal his side's sixth successive home league win.
He is the first Everton player to score at least 20 league goals in a season since Gary Lineker hit 30 in 1985-86.
"You are surprised about this?" added Koeman when asked about Lukaku's performance.
"He is a professional and every professional gives the best for the club, the players, for everybody.
"Of course we like to keep best players and we will do the maximum to keep these players.
"But the final decision will be with the player himself."

"The impressive thing is that this is his fifth full season and he is on target to play over 30 games in every season, which is superb.
"I do think he'll go. I think the big boys will come sniffing for him. I think Manchester United will be looking for a forward or two, as will Arsenal and Chelsea.
"He's 23 years old, got a fantastic goalscoring record. They paid £28m for him? When you look at the prices now, you're talking £60m, £70m?"
Meanwhile, Everton midfielder Morgan Schneiderlin is facing "several weeks" out after suffering a calf injury against Hull.
The French midfielder, 27, had to be replaced after half an hour.
"I am a little bit worried he will be out for several weeks but we need to wait for the scan to know what happened," Koeman said.
Everton are sixth in the table on 50 points with nine games remaining.
Their first game back after the international break is away to Liverpool in the Merseyside derby on Saturday, 1 April (12:30 BST).
