County Championship: Yorkshire fight back after early Lancashire burst

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Gritty Yorkshire rallied well on the first day of the Roses match at Headingley after being reduced to 29-4 by Lancashire inside the first hour.

Despite 36 from captain Andrew Gale, the Tykes were still in trouble against the Championship leaders on 74-5.
But a stand of 136 between Adil Rashid (88) and Tim Bresnan (69) rescued the reigning county champions.
Steven Patterson (41 not out) and Andrew Hodd (40) then further held up the visitors as Yorkshire ended 301-9.
On the day he was awarded his county cap, Hodd only departed in the final over, ending play four balls early when he became a third victim for Neil Wagner (3-70).
But, coming off the back of his career-best match figures of 11-119 in the win over Surrey, Jarvis again took the bowling honours.
He claimed 3-29 in nine overs in a dramatic start to the 256th Roses match after Lancashire had asked them to bat first without a toss, ultimately finishing with a day's haul of 4-74.
Yorkshire were missing Ryan Sidebottom, who will be sidelined for six weeks with the hairline fracture of his ankle that he picked up playing football during a warm-up.
Lancashire opted not to use the newly re-signed Jos Buttler, who was rested after returning from Indian Premier League duty in the T20 Blast home defeat by Durham on Friday night.
His deputy, regular Championship wicket-keeper, Alex Davies, was missing, having injured his knee in that game, so Lancashire captain Steven Croft opted to don the gauntlets himself. And he took the first of his two catches in the first over, when Adam Lyth got a touch to only Tom Bailey's fourth delivery.
Lancashire captain Steven Croft:
"I started keeping at Blackpool, then turned to to seam bowling and spin, so I have done it before but not for a while. It was hard work but I enjoyed it and it's been a good day.
"We made a good start, they came back well with Rash and Bres but we've pulled back again after tea.
"Jarvis got the wickets again but all the guys bowled well. Tom Bailey kept it tight and also Simon Kerrigan."
Yorkshire & England all-rounder Adil Rashid:
"We needed that as a team. Me and Bressy dug deep. We played positively, as we usually do,
"Thankfully it came off. We're in a better position now with 300 up.
"And there's a bit more bounce in the pitch, which should be good for our bowlers."
