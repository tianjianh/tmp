The profit was achieved on turnover of £297m in the 15 months to December 2014.
The directors' report said the figures showed a "substantial improvement" in the Ballymena-based group's performance.
It added that the outlook for 2015 was positive with a strong UK order book.
The business now employs more than 1,500 people, mainly in Ballymena.
Meanwhile, the Wright family's company, which ultimately owns the business, made charitable donations of £4.4m in the last year.
The donation from the Cornerstone Group was described as funds for "Christian, evangelical and other charitable activities".
