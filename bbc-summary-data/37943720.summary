Bridge replacement work to prevent flooding in St Asaph

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A new bridge is being built in a Denbighshire city as part of major flood defence work.

It follows the death of a 91-year-old woman who drowned four years ago and 400 homes were flooded when the river Elwy burst its banks in St Asaph.
The bridge will be higher than the original which became blocked by debris, creating a dam that overflowed.
Natural Resources Wales (NRW) is part way through the improvement work which is scheduled to last up to 18 months.
City mayor and flood warden councillor Colin Hardie said: "Everyone who suffered then still worries about bad weather.
"That was highlighted last winter when we were inches from the flood banks over-topping again.
"It's quite a worrying time and we realise we still have to go through at least one more winter before the defences are complete."
NRW is raising the flood defences as well as replacing the bridge.
