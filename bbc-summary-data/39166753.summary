Farah, who won 10,000m gold on the opening day, will attempt to secure Britain's second medal of the championships when he runs in the 5,000m final.
Jamaican superstar Bolt is aiming to end his glittering career with gold in the 4x100m relay, having had to settle for bronze in the 100m last Saturday.
Here's our guide to the key events and coverage times.
*All times listed are BST. The BBC is not responsible for any changes to event start times.
Seven gold medals: Women's high jump, women's 100m hurdles, men's javelin, men's 5,000m, men's decathlon, women's and men's 4x100m relay
BBC coverage: 09:30-12:00 & 18:30-22:10 BBC One; 09:30-22:00 BBC Connected TV and online (uninterrupted coverage); 12:00-12:30 BBC Two; 12:30-13:30 BBC Red Button; 20:00-22:30 BBC Radio 5 live
Main events:
19:05 - Women's high jump final: Russian Maria Lasitskene, competing as an independent athlete, won gold in Beijing two years ago and boasts the top 10 jumps of 2017. The 24-year-old has won her past 22 competitions and is the clear favourite. Among the chasing pack are two British heptathletes by trade - Morgan Lake and Katarina Johnson-Thompson.
20:05 - Women's 100m hurdles final: Kendra Harrison, one of four Americans in the final, broke a 28-year-old world record in this stadium 12 months ago at the Anniversary Games, but she only scraped into the final. London 2012 champion Sally Pearson looks in good form and could stop the United States from a clean sweep. Jamaica's Danielle Williams, the reigning world champion, crashed out in the semi-finals.
20:20 - Men's 5,000m final: The final championship track race of Farah's illustrious career. Victory here would be a fourth consecutive 5,000m win at the World Championships, but is he tired after his 10,000m heroics? Precocious 17-year-old Seleman Barega and Ethiopian team-mates Yomif Kejelcha and Muktar Edris, plus Kenya-born American Paul Chelimo, look to be his main threats. Fellow Briton Andrew Butchart, sixth in Rio last summer, also starts.
21:30 & 21:50 - Women's and men's 4x100m finals respectively: Hot on the heels of Farah's farewell comes Bolt's send-off as he competes for Jamaica, looking for a 12th world title to go with his eight Olympic golds. The American team are always strong - and could help Justin Gatlin to a second gold to follow his 100m triumph. The GB team, including Adam Gemili, will look to deny both victory - as long as they all make it through the heats at 10:55. Meanwhile, the British women's team will attempt to repeat their Rio 2016 bronze medal.
