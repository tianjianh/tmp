County Championship: Petersen misses ton but Lancs respond well to huge Hants total

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Alviro Petersen missed out on a third first-class ton of 2016, but Lancashire lost only three wickets on another batsman-friendly day at Southampton.

Petersen made 98, while Haseeb Hameed (89) and Luke Procter (54) also made half-centuries and visiting skipper Steven Croft is still there on 41.
After resuming on 70-1, that helped Lancashire close on 310-4, within 89 runs of avoiding the follow-on target.
Paceman Gareth Berg took two of the three wickets that fell for Hampshire.
Berg found an inswinger to take the wicket of teenage opener Hameed, whose latest half-century was his fifth in successive matches.
But, although he too missed on a third ton of the summer, his knock still took him past 1,000 first-class career runs in just his 15th appearance - and to 759 Championship runs for the season.
Petersen remains on 41 first-class centuries, 11 of which have come in the County Championship, five for Lancashire, three for Somerset, two for Glamorgan and one for Essex.
Lancs batsman Alviro Petersen told BBC Radio Lancashire:
"The pitch is deteriorating a bit. It is spinning more but it is still a good wicket and you can score runs. It could be tricky. I'm not gutted to get out of 98. I was dropped on 20 so I got 70 extra runs. The spinners are coming into it more but there is something still for the seamers.
"The best we can get out of this game is a draw. We would be happier of the two teams with that. We cannot win this game.
"I would have liked us to be closer to the top of the Championship. We will have to look in the last few games where we are. Are we going to fight to win the Championship or fight relegation?
"To win the title we need to win three games, but lose three and we are fighting relegation. We have to be on top of our game every single day."
