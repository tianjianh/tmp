The attack on the beach near Sousse left 38 people dead, with the majority of the victims British.
Three of the men who died were Walsall FC fans and scarves have been laid at the team's stadium in memory of them.
Sandwell Council has opened two books of condolence for the men, who were members of the same family, as one worked for the council.
Council leader Darren Cooper said colleagues of Adrian Evans, a gas manager, were in a "state of shock".
"I've had staff on the phone in tears," he said.
Mr Evans' nephew, 19-year-old Joel Richards, was a student at the University of Worcester.
Staff and students were invited to gather at the flagpole on the university's St John's Campus for an act of remembrance for him.
University of Worcester vice chancellor Prof David Green said: "It's a real tragedy, we're all deeply affected. Joel was a particularly popular and outgoing student."
One of the women killed was 24-year-old Carly Lovett, a University of Lincoln graduate from Gainsborough.
West Lindsey District Council said a minute's silence would be held at its next meeting as a mark of respect.
Ms Lovett ran a beauty and lifestyle blog, and fellow bloggers including Lily Pebbles have paid tribute to her.
A candle was lit at St Petroc's Church in Bodmin on Sunday for Stephen Mellor, 59, and his wife Cheryl, 55.
Mr Mellor, from Bodmin in Cornwall, was killed as he tried to protect his wife from the gunman.
Mrs Mellor was left with gunshot wounds to her arm and leg and is being treated in hospital in Sousse.
Water company Severn Trent said it was "immensely saddened" by the deaths of its "much loved colleagues" Scott Chalkley and Sue Davey.
Mr Chalkley, from Chaddesden, Derby, and Ms Davey, from Tamworth, Staffordshire, were a couple and were on holiday together.
Ms Davey's daughter is the partner of Leicester City player Marc Albrighton and the club offered its "sincerest condolences" to the family.
Stuart Cullen, 52, from the Lowestoft area, is believed to have died instantly during Friday's attack but his wife survived.
She has been treated for her injuries and has now returned home, according to Suffolk Police.
Lowestoft mayor Stephen Ardley, who was holidaying in Sousse last week, said: "My heartfelt sympathy goes out to not only the Cullen family, but to all the families and friends that have been affected by this devastating act of cruelty."
Claire Windass, 54, from Hull, was sunbathing on the beach with her husband Jim Windass, 66, when she was killed.
In a statement released through Humberside Police, her family said Mr Windass had "miraculously managed to escape physically unharmed" and had now returned to his home in Hull.
The statement said Mrs Windass was "a warm, kind-hearted woman who made friends easily and was loved by everyone who knew her".
Another East Yorkshire victim was Bruce Wilkinson, 72, a retired power station worker from Goole.
In a statement, his family said: "We are devastated at the loss of Bruce, who was a devoted husband, father and grandfather.
"Bruce was a loving family man, and in his working life worked to support the care of others."
A granddaughter of Lisa Burbidge, from Whickham, Gateshead, left a tribute on the Facebook page of the Newcastle Chronicle.
"My angel, my best friend love you always grandma, rest in peace," it said.
Her family released a statement saying: "We have been left with a massive hole in our hearts. She leaves behind many family members including four fantastic grandchildren who were her world and will miss her tremendously."
