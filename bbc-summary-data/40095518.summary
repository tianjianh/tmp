The shares touched $1,001.20 at one point in early trade before slipping back to $998. It originally listed its shares in May 1997 for just $18 each.
Amazon now has a market capitalisation of about $478bn, which is more than twice that of Wal-Mart.
After starting as a bookseller, it has steadily expanded to become much broader-based retailer.
According to consultancy Slice Intelligence. Amazon now accounts for about 43% of all online sales in the US.
Amazon is now the fourth-largest US company by market capitalisation, behind Apple, Google owner Alphabet and Microsoft.
Alphabet's class A shares were also close to hitting four figures on Tuesday, trading at $995, meaning the company is worth $681bn.
Despite the rise in Amazon's share price, the Nasdaq index - of which Amazon is a member - was down 4.03 points at 6,206.17.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 30.36 points to 21,049.92 while the wider S&P 500 index slid 2.30 points to 2,413.52 as investors picked their way through a raft of US economic data.
Figures from the Commerce Department showed that consumer spending posted its biggest rise for four months in April, climbing 0.4%. That followed an upwardly revised 0.3% increase in March.
Separate data showed the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index rose by 0.2% in April, following a 0.2% fall in March. Prices in April were up 1.7% from a year earlier, although that was down from March's figure of 1.9%.
The so-called core PCE price index - which strips out food and energy prices, and is the Federal Reserve's favoured inflation measure - showed a 1.5% annual rise, compared with a 1.6% increase in March.
The Fed targets a rate of 2% for the core PCE index. Many analysts expect that the US central bank will raise interest rates when it meets next month.
