Six stats that show just how epic Wales v England will be

The Six Nations is bigger than ever before, broadcast in 190 countries and streamed live in another 20.

Only four of the 75 matches over the last five years have been played in stadiums less than 90% full, with the average capacity now around 98%.
It is also more competitive and unpredictable. At least four countries have realistic ambitions of winning.
And as England and Wales gear up for the match, here are some of the most important stats you should know.
Five England players are making their Six Nations debuts: Anthony Watson, Jonathan Joseph, George Ford, Dave Attwood and George Kruis.
Wales have a first choice 15 to call on.
No wonder the bookies are tipping the Welsh.
Last time out in Cardiff, Wales achieved a record 30-3 win.
By the end, 70,000 Welsh fans were chanting "easy, easy".
England have been using loudspeakers playing Welsh hymns during practice so they don't get intimidated again and have insisted the roof stays open.
This is being called the "biggest opening match" in Six Nations history by England's former World Cup-winning coach, Clive Woodward.
One team's Grand Slam hopes will be in tatters by 22:00 GMT and the next time the sides will meet will be in the World Cup group stage in September.
England's pack is 3st 2lb (20kg) heavier than the Welsh.
The combined pack weight comes in at 283st 7lb (1,800kg) - still only equivalent to an average female rhinoceros.
About 60,000 pints of lager are expected to be drunk by the crowd going to the match.
If Wales win, expect the city to run dry thereafter.
The average height of both teams is 6ft 3in (1.85m), the average weight is 18st 1lb (kg).
That's 6 inches (15.2cm) taller than the national average and five stone (32kg) heavier.
