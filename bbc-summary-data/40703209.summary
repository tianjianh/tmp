Tokyo Ueno Zoo's giant panda baby has just turned 40 days old. She weighs 1.5 kg and is 34cm long.
The baby, born June 12 2017, opened her eyes a little and is expected to have them wide open within a couple of days, according to the zoo experts.
She'll be expected to start walking when she's about three months old.
She hasn't got a name yet, as the zoo is planning to ask the public for suggestions.
