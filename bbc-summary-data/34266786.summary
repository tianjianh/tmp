Why Jeremy Corbyn's first Prime Minister's Questions matters

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
It is easy to see Prime Minister's Questions as a pointless bear pit. Jeremy Corbyn has made plain he thinks it has to change - a more consensual, polite approach is his tactic, using questions that members of the public have sent in.

Will it work? Perhaps. Others, including the PM, have argued for an end to its Punch and Judy style. But there is a risk Mr Corbyn comes across as such a fish out of water if it falls flat.
There are good reasons though why PMQs is not to be dismissed. For the political world, it is the one guaranteed occasion each week where the opposition, not the government machine, has a chance to shape the agenda and get their issues to the top of the list.
For many members of the public  who don't pay attention to the minutiae of politics, it is the one exchange each week that is likely to end up on the national news bulletins or in the newspapers - the one bit of politics the politically averse are most likely to see.
This is Jeremy Corbyn's real shop window for the voting public, not town hall meetings around the country.
And for leaders it is a moment when, traditionally, they have to show they are in command of their party.
Jeremy Corbyn is in command of Labour members - the MPs who'll sit behind him at PMQs are another matter. But today is an important test not just for Mr Corbyn personally, but for his new approach - how successful can his new rules be, when everyone else is playing by the old?
David Cameron is likely to respond with politeness, attacks probably on Labour, rather than Mr Corbyn himself.
But Conservatives think Labour have made an error of judgement in their choice. The PM might not be able to resist the temptation to focus on Mr Corbyn's woes for very long.
