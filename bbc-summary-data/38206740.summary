A club claiming to be the "oldest continuous ladies football" side in England is celebrating its 50th anniversary.

Leicester City Ladies FC, which is not officially affiliated to the city's title-winning men's team, was formed in 1966 after a supporters' club meeting.
The players had to borrow kit and train in a car park in the early days.
Once considered a "taboo" by their male counterparts, the club has ambitions to reach the Women's Super League.
Having been one of the clubs represented at the first meeting of the Women's Football Association in June 1970, Leicester Ladies have been praised for their longevity.
Gill Ridgley, who looks after the women's football collection at the British Library, said: "It's a testament to these women's determination and love of football that they carried on playing despite all the obstacles - and these were many - that were put in their way."
Internal problems that have threatened the club's existence over the decades have included a lack of personnel and financial problems, officials said.
"It has been a real rollercoaster," club secretary and ex-player Sue Foulkes said.
"There's been many a time when the club could have gone under and it is just down to a bit of resilience from a few of us that have kept it going."
The team was initially met with scepticism, but has grown and played at Wembley in 1996 before the play-off final between Leicester City and Crystal Palace.
"The original team started to train in the car park at the old Filbert Street ground," Ms Foulkes said.
"Nothing was supported by the FA at that time and it was absolutely taboo for clubs to help a women's team with facilities.
"When they came out to play in the first game, we had a Welsh left back called Peter Rodrigues who played for Leicester City, who borrowed kit from the club so they wore those.
"They played their first game and we've been going ever since."
