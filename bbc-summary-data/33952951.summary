Kids Company provided practical, emotional and educational support to some of the most deprived and vulnerable children and young people in London, Bristol and Liverpool.
The charity closed its offices on 5 August amid a row over funding.
Esther Keller said if some funding can be found it would be possible to resume the charity's work.
"There's enough emotional goodwill among staff - 80 staff lost their jobs - and it would be very, very hard work but I can see it happening," said Mrs Keller.
"There are an awful lot of children and young people who will be completely lost without us."
Kids Company provided services including counselling and walk-in centres with hot meals for those whose parents were often unable to care for them.
It had six centres in Bristol and approximately 600 children on its books.
The only continued funding has come from Bristol City Council for one month, for one post-16 drop-in centre.
