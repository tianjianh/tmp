The 23-year-old Brazilian, on loan from Chelsea, suffered the injury as he fouled Bluebirds winger Kadeem Harris, and was booked before being replaced.
Piazon has scored six times in 24 games this season for the Championship side.
"This is the worst news for us," Jokanovic said after the match. "He will have a period out of the squad."
