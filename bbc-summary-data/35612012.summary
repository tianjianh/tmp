The two-year-old was being rushed from Warwick Hospital to Horton Hospital in Banbury with suspected meningitis and was not strapped in, her family said.
The vehicle left the road at high speed near Banbury, Oxfordshire, resting at the bottom of a steep bank, they said.
West Midlands Ambulance Service is carrying out an internal investigation.
The child's grandfather, Bill Robison, from Radford Semele in Warwickshire, said she was now in intensive care at the John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford.

The girl was "gravely ill" at the time and Mr Robison said on Friday he did not wish to criticise the ambulance service for what happened.
The mother and daughter suffered bruising in the crash, which happened at about 03:30 GMT on Thursday.
Mr Robison said he believed the two medics were also injured, with one suffering a head injury.
"We don't really know exactly what happened as my daughter is concentrating on her daughter right now but, they were travelling fast, but I'm sure within the limit, on the motorway, just before junction 11, and suddenly heard 'a clonk'," he said.
"It left the road, went down the embankment and rolled several times.
An ambulance spokesman said a response crew was sent to the scene and arrived within ten minutes.  The injured crew were taken to Warwick Hospital as a precaution.
The driver was unhurt while the ambulance attendant, who was travelling in the back with the patient, had minor abrasions.
The spokesman added that it was not known if blue lights were being used on the ambulance at the time because the roads would have been quiet.
"The use of lights and sirens will form part of the investigation," he said.
The service would not comment as to whether the girl was strapped in.
