Gillian Ayres, whose paintings are featured in the Tate Gallery and the Museum of  Modern Art in New York, is showcasing her paintings in Cardiff.
Ms Ayres, 87, lived in the Llyn Peninsula, Gwynedd, from 1981-1987. Her work will go on display in the National Museum from Saturday.
Curator Melissa Munroe said Ms Ayres was a "pioneer of abstract painting".
The collection in Ms Ayres' biggest UK exhibition has more than 40 of her works, including a painting inspired by Monet which has not been exhibited since the 1970s.
The display will reflect on the artist's time in Llaniestyn and her vibrant artwork painted during this time.
"I used to visit Wales a lot before I moved there," said Ms Ayres.
"It was lovely, a marvellous place to live and paint."
