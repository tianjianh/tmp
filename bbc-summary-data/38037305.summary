The Fukuoka regatta is the ninth and final stop of the series.
The winner of the overall series, in which Ainslie's team lead by 15 points, will earn two bonus points to carry into the qualifiers in June.
The winner of that qualifying series in Bermuda in May and June 2017 will face Oracle Team USA in the main event, the 2017 America's Cup - also in Bermuda - later in June.
"I think we're on target in terms of our goals for this campaign," Ainslie said. "We did set up a very, very ambitious target to try and win the America's Cup. I still believe we can win this cup."
Watch highlights of the final round of the America's Cup World Series from Japan on Monday 21 November at 20:00 GMT on BBC Red Button, the BBC Sport website & app.
