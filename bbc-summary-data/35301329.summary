P&O Ferries: Larne to Troon route to close with immediate effect

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The ferry route between Larne and Troon is to close with immediate effect, P&O Ferries has said.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The company said that the closure was because of "significant losses" and that "income from ticket sales" did not cover the costs of running the route.
It said no jobs would be lost, with all permanent staff being given different roles in the company.
It also said that the Larne to Cairnryan route will continue to operate.
In a statement, P&O said that an attempt to save the Larne to Troon route by reducing the service in off-peak months had failed.
"Whilst this measure did significantly reduce the operating costs, the route remained loss-making," it said.
"Since the last sailing at the end of September, P&O Ferries has continued to negotiate with a number of suppliers and other organisations, including the search for a lower cost chartered fast-craft to be able to continue, but we have been unable to develop a solution for the company."
The statement added: "The company believes that this decision will enable a more secure future for its employees and for its customers on the northern corridor."
