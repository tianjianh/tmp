Cardiff City manager Russell Slade says he will do "everything he can" to improve the Bluebirds' away form.

The Championship side have failed to score or win in any of their matches on the road since Slade took charge in October.
At home though, Cardiff have won all four matches under Slade, Friday's 2-1 win against Reading the latest.
"We'll work, look at the game plan, personnel and do everything we can," said Slade.
"Because if we can get that right we know that we will be a threat."
The victory over 10-man Reading moved Cardiff to within three points of the Championship play-off places.
Royals defender Alex Pearce's own goal gave the home side the lead.
The 26-year-old was then sent off for a trip on Adam Le Fondre in the box, that allowed Peter Whittingham to double City's advantage from the penalty spot.
Michael Hector's late strike gave the 10 men of Reading hope of a point, but Cardiff held on for the victory.
"We are doing particularly well at home at the minute. We seem to be able to score goals," said Slade.
"We made it hard work against the 10-men. I don't think we started the game too well if I'm honest, but then I thought we gradually got into the game and got on top.
"The goal just before half-time was very important to us, but against the 10-men, fair play to Reading they stayed in the game, but I think we should have converted a few more chances."
Cardiff, who moved up to 11th in the table on Friday, are next in action away to sixth-placed Watford on Saturday 29 November.
