The 16-year-old defender has played for Wales at under-16 and under-19 level.
He was named in Wales boss Chris Coleman's senior squad for their World Cup qualifier against Serbia in May, but did not play and is uncapped.
Ampadu made 13 Exeter appearances in 2016-17 and they hope to earn a fee for the player who came through their academy.
