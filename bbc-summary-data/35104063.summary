Sibusiso Ndebele is accused of accepting more than $665,000 (Â£440,000) to facilitate tenders worth $133m while transport minister, local media reports.
The court did not ask him to plead and he was freed on bail.
Mr Ndebele is the latest in a string of senior South African officials to face corruption charges.
Mr Ndebele was freed on $670 bail by a magistrate at the commercial crimes court in KwaZulu-Natal province, National Prosecution Authority (NPA) spokesman Luvuyo Mfaku told the BBC.
The case had been postponed to July 2016 so that police investigations could continue, he added.
The diplomat was investigated by the Hawks, a police unit which focuses mainly on organised crime.
Mr Ndebele  was transport minister from 2009 to 2011, and was also involved in South Africa's bid for the 2010 football World Cup.
He became ambassador to Australia in May - a post he still holds.
