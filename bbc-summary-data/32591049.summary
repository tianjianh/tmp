Israeli president Reuven Rivlin has sent a pink dress embroidered with the words, "From Israel with love".
Princess Charlotte was born on Saturday in London's St Mary's Hospital, weighing 8lbs 3oz (3.7kg).
The Queen met her new great-granddaughter at Kensington Palace for the first time on Tuesday.
Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott said a cot blanket made from Tasmanian merino wool was being sent on behalf of the Australian people to mark the royal birth.
It was made at the country's oldest weaving mill, Waverly Woollen Mills, Tasmania, and has been embroidered with the Australian floral emblem, the wattle.
Mr Abbott said his government would also be making a A$10,000 (Â£5,200) donation to the Healesville Sanctuary, in Victoria, in honour of the princess.
"I hope one day the princess can visit Australia and hold a Mountain Pygmy-possum herself," he said.
The Mountain Pygmy-possum is Australia's only hibernating marsupial, and there are fewer than 2,000 left in the wild.
Israeli President Reuven Rivlin and his wife Nechama Rivlin wished the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge "joy, health and happiness" at the birth.
They have sent a beaded brooch which features a heart-shaped charm and the "hamsa" symbol - a Middle Eastern sign of protection - as well as a dress, according to a statement from Rivlin's office.
Sharona Barzilai, who designed the dress, said: "For me this closes a circle as I learned to be a dressmaker in London, and I am delighted that my design has been sent as a present to the new princess."
Meanwhile, a Lego figure of Princess Charlotte has been added to the Buckingham Palace model at Legoland Windsor.
More than 7,000 souvenir mugs are being produced at the Emma Bridgewater factory in Stoke-on-Trent to mark the birth of the princess, whose name - Charlotte Elizabeth Diana - was announced on Monday.
About 200 staff worked throughout the night, with the first mugs finished at 06:00 BST on Tuesday.
The fourth in line to the throne will be known as Her Royal Highness Princess Charlotte of Cambridge.
The Queen is due to return to London, three days after the birth of her fifth great-grandchild.
It is believed she could meet Princess Charlotte for the first time, but a Buckingham Palace spokesman declined to comment on "speculation".
Other members of the family have already met the new addition.
The Prince of Wales and Duchess of Cornwall spent more than an hour with their new granddaughter on Sunday. The duchess's parents, Michael and Carole Middleton, and sister Pippa also met the princess.
Last year, the princess's brother Prince George was given 774 gifts - including 603 presents from Australia alone.
They included a leather flying jacket, a polo mallet and a teddy bear from US president Barack Obama.
