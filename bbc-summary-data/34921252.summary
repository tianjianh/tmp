The force said Miss Everest, who was studying at Sheffield Hallam University, had been seen on CCTV leaving the Corporation at about 02:40 GMT on Sunday.
She was then seen moments later with a man outside the Devonshire Cat, in Wellington Street.
They are then seen parting company on Napier Street, in the Sharrow area of the city, at about 03:35, before Miss Everest was seen walking along Summerfield Street, in the direction of the Porter Brook at about 03:45.
Det Ch Insp Victoria Short said: "At this time, we are treating Caroline's death as unexplained.
"A post-mortem examination was completed, however the cause of death was not established and the results were recorded as inconclusive. Further tests have now been requested."
She said the man had been arrested followed an extensive trawl of CCTV footage and the detective renewed an appeal for anyone who may have seen Miss Everest after she left the nightclub to come forward.
The teenager was reported missing by her family, who live about four miles away in the north of Sheffield, after she failed to turn up for a family dinner on Sunday.
Her body was found in the Porter Brook, which is little more than a stream, near Summerfield Street at about 03:45 on Tuesday.
Sheffield Hallam University, where Miss Everest was studying biosciences and chemistry, said support was available for anyone affected by Ms Everest's death.
Tracey Lancaster, the university's director of corporate affairs, said: "Caroline was well liked by staff and fellow students on her biosciences and chemistry course and had made an excellent start to her studies.
"She will be very sadly missed and our thoughts at this time continue to be with her family and close friends, to whom we are offering support."
Flowers have been laid at the police cordon on Ecclesall Road. A note attached to one bunch reads: "RIP Caroline. Another young life taken too early. Thoughts are with your family at this sad time."
