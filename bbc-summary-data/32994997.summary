The pictures, issued by Operation Resolve, the team dedicated to investigating the tragedy on 15 April 1989, comes after five earlier appeals.
Overall, images of 71 people have been released, with 33 who have been identified or come forward.
Ninety-six Liverpool fans died after a crush in the FA Cup semi-final at the Sheffield stadium.
The appeal was launched at the request of coroner Sir John Goldring and the victims' families.
Investigators urged people to heed warnings about not passing comment on the appeal or any other aspect of the disaster on social media and forums.
Images of all those yet to be traced are available on the Operation Resolve website.
The new inquests into the disaster are currently taking place in Warrington, Cheshire.
