Waterworth headed in from close range after meeting a Guy Bates cross from the left in the 27th minute.
The striker drilled the ball underneath Aaron Shanahan  on 47 and Mark Haughey headed in the third after 70 minutes.
Mark Hughes grabbed a consolation with a low shot but Waterworth volleyed home on 84 and slotted into the net on 88.
The Blues were eager to bounce back from last week's defeat by champions Crusaders and Aaron Burns had an early chance, but his shot was palmed away by Shanahan.
Waterworth's opener broke down the visitors' resistance and the striker put his team well in command shortly after the interval.
Central defender Haughey converted the rebound after an initial effort from Niall Quinn's corner had been saved, then Hughes fired into the bottom right corner, with Ross Glendinning unable to hold his right-foot shot from the edge of the box.
Waterworth completed his treble with his 13th goal of the season, finding the net with a neat finish from Quinn's left-wing cross.
The former Glentoran forward took his tally for the day to four by rounding Shanahan and slotting into the empty net.
