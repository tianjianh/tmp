The League One side sealed the lucrative game with a stoppage-time 2-1 victory against Queen of the South.
So, what do we know about the part-time side from Coatbridge, managed by former Aberdeen midfielder Darren Young?
Jock Stein made his Albion Rovers debut as a trialist against Celtic in a 4-4 draw in 1942. He combined his playing role while working as a coal miner.
Stein, the first British manager to lift the European Cup, was with the club for eight years before moving to Llanelli Town.
Back on 9 March 2014 Albion Rovers were drawn to play Rangers in the Scottish Cup at Ibrox.
Rovers had already seen off Premiership side Motherwell earlier in the competition, Gary Phillips scoring in a 1-0 victory.
On 14 minutes Ciaran Donnelly stunned the home crowd as Rovers took the lead and for a while it looked like they might hold on for another famous win.
But Bilel Moshni levelled in the 78th minute and Rangers won the replay 2-0, with Fraser Aird and Jon Daly on target at New Douglas Park.
Albion Rovers hail [or should that be hail, hail?] from the town of Coatbridge which not only has one of the largest St Patrick's Day parades in the world, it also has more than 10 Celtic supporters' clubs.
Safe to say, it makes life a bit difficult for Rovers when it comes to attracting fans with so many following Brendan Rodgers' side.
Still, they struggle on. It will be fascinating to see how this manifests itself when the teams come face to face - expect to see plenty of those 50-50 scarves on sale.
Cliftonhill Stadium reeks of the very soul of Scottish football. An epic, dilapidated bowl of a ground that once ushered in tens of the thousands - nowadays crowds are in the hundreds.
Nevertheless, it was the field of dreams for Rovers on Tuesday when they earned a dramatic late win against Championship side Queen of the South to set up a meeting with Celtic courtesy of Calum Ferguson's 94th-minute winner.
On fan safety grounds and in the interests of making as much money from ticket sales, this match will in all likelihood be moved to either New Douglas Park - home to Hamilton Academical - or Motherwell's Fir Park.
There are a few hoops [apologies] to jump through for all this to happen - talks with the police, the clubs, the SFA will all need to take place - but it looks all but certain that poor old Cliftonhill will be dark and empty on the weekend of 21/22 January.
That was back in 1920. They beat Rangers in the semi-final. They lost to Kilmarnock 3-2 at Celtic Park in front of 95,000 fans.
