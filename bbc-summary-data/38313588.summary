A town's "dismal" Christmas lights have prompted disgruntled residents to brand the local council Scrooges.

Previous displays in Boston, Lincolnshire, have featured clusters of lights and miniature trees along its cobbled shopping streets.
But this year's simpler offering has been compared unfavourably to a living room Christmas tree by some.
Councillor Paul Skinner said the authority could no longer justify the Â£40,000 annual cost.

He said Boston Borough Council's Christmas lights contract came to an end this year, and it voted not to renew it.
In previous years, as pictured below, trees were lit up along the length of Church Street, with clusters of lights used to illuminate the sections across the street.
Posting on Facebook, one resident described the authority as "a bunch of miserable scrooges".
While one caller to BBC Radio Lincolnshire said her four-year-old daughter "absolutely cried her eyes out because there was nothing to look at".
She said her own personal Christmas tree had as many lights as the town centre display.
On social media, Frank Slater described the council as "a bunch of miserable scrooges" while Gina Tilling described the lights as "dismal".
Others said it looked as though Christmas had been cancelled, and Boston was "dark and joyless".
Barry Brackenbury joked that the council was doing its bit to "slow global warming".
Responding to the comments, Mr Skinner said: "It could have been better, but people shouldn't be surprised."
He said: "We've taken Â£2m out of the budget, and for the next four years we've got to take another Â£2m out."
The authority said it will look again at what can be done in future years.
