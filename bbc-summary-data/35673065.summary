Pro12: Benetton Treviso 13-16 Munster

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Ian Keatley kicked Munster to a nail-biting 16-13 victory at Treviso in a tight Pro12 encounter.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The fly-half won it with two second-half penalties as the Irish came from 10-5 down to triumph at Stadio Monigo.
Gerhard van der Heever and Francis Saili were Munster's try-scorers while number eight Robert Barbieri crossed the line for the hosts.
Jayden Hayward and Keatley traded penalties to leave the score 13-13, but the Munster fly-half had the last word.
South African Van der Heever put the Irish province in control early on with his 11th-minute try, but the home side responded with Barbieri's touchdown, full-back Hayward converting.
Keatley denied Hayward a try of his own after the restart when he just beat him to touch down after a foot race, but the Treviso man extended his side's advantage 12 minutes after the restart with a penalty awarded for offside.
It was 10-10 within six minutes when centre Saili chased down full-back Andrew Conway's kick to touchdown, although Keatley was again unsuccessful with his conversion attempt.
The sides were level at 13-13 with 12 minutes remaining, before Keatley kicked his decisive penalty five minutes from time.
Alarm bells were ringing when the visitors' prop Dave Kilcoyne was shown a yellow card with three minutes left on the clock, but they managed to hang on for victory.
