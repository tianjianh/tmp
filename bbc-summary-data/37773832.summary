It's not a football match, it's not a tennis tournament... No, this weekend, the summer season finals are taking place of the UK's main eSports competition, called the ESL UK Premiership.
An eSports competition is a big computer game tournament.
In London, the UK's best teams will be battling each other to be crowned the champion of games like League of Legends and Overwatch.
But what are eSports and why have they become such a big deal?
"eSports" is the short name for electronic sports.
Just like football players play football, eSports players play computer games against each other - just like you might do in your bedroom with your friends.
The difference between you playing video games with your mates and these competitive eSports players is that many fans all over the world usually watch them play, and they might even get paid for doing it.
They are also likely to play in teams, rather than on their own.
At an eSports competition, gamers will battle against each other on a particular game, with many fans watching on enormous screens.
At the same time, others can usually watch from around the world by tuning in to follow the action online.
People playing computer games against each other is nothing new - gamers have been doing this for over 30 years.
Around the year 2000, computers became cheaper and the internet became faster, which made it much easier for more people to get involved with computer gaming.
It also became easier to connect with gamers around the world, so people could play against each other - and watch others.
Now, players have become so skilled - and gained so many millions of fans - that computer gaming has become organised, competitive and professional.
As a result, it has been given its own name - "eSports".
Not everyone agrees that computer gaming should be considered to be a sport.
Some people think that sport should involve being more physically active.
But others think that despite it may not be as physically athletic as tennis or rugby, the skill involved means it can be considered a sport.
eSports have become extremely popular over the past few years and many companies all over the world are realising there is a lot of money that they can make from them.
Gamers in the UK will spend almost Â£3.3 billion on computer games this year, according to computer game research company Newzoo.
The winners of eSports competitions can go home with thousands of pounds in prize money, so there's serious cash involved.
You only have to look at how many thousands of people go to the arenas to watch eSports competitions to see that they are as important to many people as any other sports match.
The biggest eSports event last year was the League of Legends World Championships final, which attracted more than 35 million viewers!
Playing computer games for your job might sound like a dream come true - and to many people it will be!
But don't be fooled, the best eSports players have to put in a lot of hard work and training.
Some players might train for up to 14 hours a day to make sure they have extremely quick reflexes and reactions. Players might make more than 300 "actions" per minute, so they have to be able to multi-task extremely well.
Professional gamers need to practise for hours. If there's an update, they need to make sure they've mastered any changes, so that they can still be the best at it.
There is no doubt that eSports are on the rise.
"Traditional" sports clubs, like Premier League football teams, are starting to buy eSports players to represent them in competitions.
Earlier this year, it was announced that eSports would be getting an official organisation, called the World eSports Association, to be in charge of the sport - a bit like Fifa does for football.
Then, in the summer, it was revealed that the UK would be getting its first 24-hour TV channel dedicated completely to eSports.
There's no doubt that exciting changes are happening.
As technology improves, eSports will continue to grow. Could it be bigger than football one day? Only time will tell.
