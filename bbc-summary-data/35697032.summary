Bridge of Allan-based Angels' Share Glass hopes to increase production and train a new generation of glassmakers.
Co-founder Tom Young has been making glass by hand using traditional methods for nearly 60 years and currently works out of a home workshop.
Plans have been now been drawn up for a fully-equipped studio at the company's premises.
Mr Young, 77, said: "For me in particular, it'll help in terms of passing on my glassblowing skills to a new generation of young glassmakers and keeping the tradition alive."
He started as a scientific glassblower before creating his own designs which he sold at Village Glass, the Bridge of Allan shop he founded in 1979.
Mr Young came out of retirement to devise a process to seal 30ml whisky measures into glass angels.
The company's name is inspired by the myth which claims the portion of a whisky's volume lost during ageing is taken by angels.
Mr Young's daughter Karen Somerville, who is the firm's managing director, said: "We're at a bit of a crossroads now.
"Demand is outstripping supply and we need space to grow the business and allow my dad to train up more apprentices who can help keep glassblowing alive in the heart of Scotland."
