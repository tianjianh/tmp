The 35-year-old batsman will link up again with his ex-Black Caps team-mate Daniel Vettori, who was appointed Middlesex's Twenty20 coach on a three-year deal in December.
McCullum worked under Vettori at Big Bash side Brisbane Heat this winter.
Meanwhile, James Franklin, 36, has been made full-time captain in the County Championship and the One-Day Cup.
Franklin took over the captaincy on an interim basis last season following an injury to Adam Voges and helped steer the club to their first Championship title since 1993.
"It's a very exciting time for the club, getting Brendon back again after his stint with us last year," Franklin told BBC Radio London.
"He's one of the best captains in world cricket of the modern age so it's going to be exciting for players to work with him.
"And Dan being on board as the Twenty20 coach, I think it shows how progressive the club are looking at things.
"To be able to get in a coach of his calibre is hugely exciting."
Last season's T20 Blast captain Dawid Malan, 29, has been named vice-captain in that format and will lead the side when McCullum, who has re-signed for nine group games, is unavailable.
