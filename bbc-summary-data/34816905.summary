Three suicide bombers died in blasts outside the Stade de France while France played Germany on Friday.
With fans unable to leave, many poured on to the pitch, while both national teams spent the night in the stadium.
All European Rugby Champions Cup and Challenge Cup matches set to be played in France this weekend are off.
However, the French Football Federation (FFF) said Tuesday's international friendly against England at Wembley would go ahead following three days of national mourning.
England's Under-20s game against France in Brittany on Saturday was called off, with the youth team "returning to England early under care of the FA", the English Football Association said.
The postponed European Rugby Champions Cup fixtures include Glasgow Warriors' match against Racing 92 on Saturday, due to be held in the outskirts of Paris, and Bath's trip to Toulon on Sunday.
Saturday's two Challenge Cup matches in England involving French sides will go ahead. Worcester Warriors host La Rochelle, while London Irish take on Agen.
Tributes have been paid to the victims of the attacks at sporting fixtures around the world.
French President Francois Hollande was at Friday's game at the Stade de France but left before declaring a state of emergency.
France's Lassana Diarra, who was playing in the match, confirmed on Saturday that a female cousin was one of the victims.
At the end of the game, which France won 2-0, players watched the news unfolding on monitors inside the tunnel.
The French players then refused to return to their homes as a show of solidarity with their German opponents, who were taken to the airport on Saturday rather than returning to their hotel.
They had earlier been evacuated from their accommodation following a bomb threat. They have since cancelled their Sunday flight to Hannover, where they will play Netherlands on Tuesday.
Noel le Graet, president of the French Football Federation, said the organisation shared "the grief of the bereaved families and relatives".
A planned news conference on Saturday involving the France national team was cancelled.
"We are all in shock," said Germany head coach Joachim Low.
"The game and the goals move into the background on a day like this. All of us on the bench were a bit scared."
Newcastle midfielder Moussa Sissoko, one of France's substitutes, said: "There are no words to express what I feel today... All my thoughts to all the victims' families and friends."
Former France international Thierry Henry added: "I'm appalled by the shocking scenes in Paris at the moment. My thoughts are with all the victims and innocent people suffering right now."
The FA said: "We send our deep condolences to the victims of the Paris attacks. This is clearly a very serious and tragic matter."
