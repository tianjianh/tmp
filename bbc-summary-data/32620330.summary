[SN]TITLE[SN]
Judge hears judicial review application into hospital maternity plan

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A bid to challenge plans to downgrade the maternity service at a Denbighshire hospital has ended for the day.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board wants to temporarily remove the doctor-led maternity service at Ysbyty Glan Clwyd.
But it is facing a legal fight from campaigners who are applying for a judicial review at Mold County Court.
The judge, Mrs Justice Davies, asked the health board and campaigners to meet but an agreement was not made.
Opponents argue the health board had not properly consulted over its plans.
Mark Sutton QC, representing the campaigners, told the court: "This is a striking case indeed.
"It's not a case where there has been an attempt at consultation but that's been limited.
"It's striking that there was a decision to suppress the dissemination of the board paper relevant to the matter which would normally be available seven days in advance."
He added that it was strange that "a public authority with a primary responsibility to engage should regard it as an appropriate action to stifle any meaningful debate."
The application which has been made by a local GP and a woman has support from the British Medical Association Cymru.
Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board was expected to go ahead with plans to end consultant-led services at the hospital in April.
But it was put on hold to await Thursday's hearing.
The hearing continues.
