Northants gave themselves a chance of qualifying for the One-Day Cup quarter-finals with a four-wicket home win over already-qualified Gloucestershire.

Gareth Roderick's 57 from 71 balls for the visitors was followed by 80 from Benny Howell, but they only made 215.
Northants opener Josh Cobb struck 58 from 83 balls including eight fours as they made easy work of their chase.
Alex Wakely (31no) and Kyle Coetzer (23no) saw them home on 217-6 with nine overs remaining.
Gloucestershire lost Chris Dent, Geraint Jones and Miles Hammond all for ducks as Olly Stone (3-34) and Steven Crook (4-37) bowled well for the home side.
And it was just a case of maintaining their focus for Northants after Cobb and David Willey (41) launched their reply with a partnership of 80.
Having qualified for T20 Blast finals day last week, they will reach the last eight of the One-Day Cup if they beat Yorkshire at Headingley on Tuesday.
