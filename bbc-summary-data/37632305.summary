Brexit: Key quotes from non-UK figures

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Key quotes from high-profile European and other figures on Britain's EU referendum, as compiled by BBC Monitoring between 6-12 October.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
"It must be clear that if Britain wants access to the internal market, all the rules and freedoms around the internal market must be totally respected. On that point we must be intransigent. I see the manoeuvres...  You cannot have one foot in and one foot out. If we start to dismantle the internal market by agreeing to the demands of a country that wants to leave, then we will be bringing about the end of Europe." (Paris news conference with French Prime Minister Manuel Valls, 7 Oct)
"Brexit negotiations won't be easy. If we don't say full access to the internal market is linked to full freedom of movement, then a movement will spread in Europe where everyone just does whatever they want. We have to make our interests align so that European industry federations don't put pressure on us." (Speaking at German trade and industry meeting in Berlin, 6 Oct)
"We must try to formulate offers in a way so that the British remain close to us, also to have the chance to return some day." (At same meeting in Berlin, 6 Oct)
"The UK wants to leave and pay nothing. It's not possible. There must be a threat, there must be a risk, there must be a price. Otherwise we will be in a negotiation that cannot end well." (Speaking at Paris Delors Institute, 6 Oct)
"There are principles, and on these principles no country still remaining in the EU will budge. That is the position of France, just as much as it is the position of Germany." (10 Oct)
"We want to work towards a constructive, open and close relationship with the UK, both bilaterally and also in terms of the UK's relationship with the EU as a whole. The UK can leave the EU, but the UK doesn't stop being a big European partner." (Bloomberg TV interview in Macau, 11 Oct)
"It appears as if there's quite a lot of work that needs to be done in the UK before there's a clear view of what the British want. The British government is putting in some efforts to identify what kind of relationship they want. All the same, the UK's partners can't move ahead until the UK has done this work."  ​​(Bloomberg interview after meeting British Prime Minister Theresa May in Copenhagen, 10 Oct)
"The first step must be taken by the UK... The internal market means free movement of people, goods, services and capital. That is not a selection menu, it is all inextricably linked. The negotiations will require significant British effort: a final agreement is not only in the interests of the EU but also of the UK..." (After meeting Mrs May in The Hague, 10 Oct)
"Shutting the frontiers for a day would show people what it means to wait two hours to get into Italy or Spain, to have controls everywhere, to block all exchanges. One day. So that people see what it is to be outside Europe. It's terrible what I'm saying, but it would be good for people to understand. The UK wants to have its cake and eat it. Before, they were in and they had many opt-outs; now they want to be out with many opt-ins. We're not on Facebook where there's an 'it's complicated' status." (Speaking at a conference on Brexit in Paris, 10 Oct) 
"It is their choice to go for a hard Brexit, and I would not be in favour of that at all." (10 Oct)
"Whatever the final settlement, what we know with certainty is that Brexit has increased the risk to the Irish economy." (10 Oct) 
"It will be a process like no other with far-reaching consequences - its final scope no-one can predict with absolute certainty. It is not only about trading arrangements and access to the EU's single market... is also about preserving our joint and unique culture, our decades of strategic partnership and our commitment to the same shared values..." (Speaking in London after meeting Theresa May, 11 Oct)
