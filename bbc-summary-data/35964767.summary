A group of students have occupied an Edinburgh University building in protest against its investment in fossil fuels.

About 20 people are involved in the protest, which is being led by the university's People and Planet group.
A university spokesman said it did not invest in companies involved in the highest carbon-emitting industries.
It said it had "divested millions of pounds from three of the world's biggest fossil fuels producers."
The students said they would end the occupation when the university made a public commitment to never invest in any companies taking over 5% profit from fossil fuel extraction and arms manufacture, and to withdraw its remaining oil and gas investments.
A spokesman for the protesters said: "We are of course happy that the university is moving its money away from fossil fuels and arms, however the aim of our campaign is to break down the institutional power which these toxic institutions hold.
"By publicly committing never to invest in these industries Edinburgh has the chance to help put an end to the influence held by companies which profit off the back of war and climate change."
