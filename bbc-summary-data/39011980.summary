[SN]TITLE[SN]
Sheffield United 2-0 Bolton Wanderers

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Billy Sharp netted twice as Sheffield United beat Bolton to move clear at the top of League One.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Sharp took his goal tally to 23 for the season to give United a commanding seven-point advantage over Fleetwood and Scunthorpe.
The defeat for Bolton leaves them in fourth and without an away win since late November.
The home side created more chances in the game and skipper David Wheater was called into action early on when he headed Jake Wright's volley off the line.
Shortly after, though, his defensive partner Mark Beevers let John Fleck's through ball to Sharp go under his foot and the striker slotted past goalkeeper Mark Howard.
Second-half substitute Samir Carruthers combined well down the right-hand side with Kieron Freeman to break into the area, before Beevers brought down Carruthers in the area as he turned inside.
Sharp slotted home the penalty as the Blades earned their first win over the Trotters since 2008.
