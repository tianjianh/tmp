Well, that's what is happening at the London Toy Fair, the biggest toy fair in the UK.
There are hundreds of toys on display including some you've never seen before.
But you won't be able to buy any of these toys just yet - the fair is only for shopkeepers to decide what they want to sell in their shops.
BBC technology reporter Zoe Kleinman went along to check it out.
From robot hamsters to electric scooters, hundreds of toys are on display at the London Toy Fair.
