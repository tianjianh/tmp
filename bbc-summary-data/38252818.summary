Executive Office to spend £5m on Derry office block

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Executive Office is to spend up to £5m on a new, high quality office block in Londonderry.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 62,000 sq ft grade A office at Ebrington "could cater for up to 500 people". It will be built on top of an existing underground car park.
Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness said it was "part of a drive to attract investment to the north west".
The Department of Finance has approved the project's business case.
A developer will now be sought for the building.
Ebrington is the largest regeneration site in the city, having been formerly owned by the Ministry of Defence.
The Executive Office said the office development "is an incentive for potential investors".
