Merseyside Police said another man, 41, is also critically ill after the Cream Grand Finale at Nation in Wolstenholme Square on Saturday.
The first man was taken ill at about 03:30 GMT and died in hospital a short time after admission.
A post-mortem examination is due to take place, police said.
The circumstances surrounding what happened to both men are being investigated by officers.
Det Ch Inspector Andy Ephgrave said: "At this stage of the investigation, we are exploring a number of lines of inquiry and it is unclear if both men took illegal substances. The men were not in a group together."
He added: "We would like to take this opportunity to remind people of the dangers of taking illegal drugs."
The so-called "super club" first opened its doors at Nation in 1992 and went on to become an international brand branching out into Cream Ibiza and the Creamfields festival.
Nation is closing to be replaced by a new music venue.
