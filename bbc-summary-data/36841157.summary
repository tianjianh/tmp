Angel Maria Villar: Spanish football chief will run for Uefa presidency

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Spanish Football Federation president Angel Maria Villar has announced he will stand for the Uefa presidency.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Michel Platini resigned from the role in May after failing to overturn a ban imposed for ethics breaches over a £1.3m payment he received from former Fifa president Sepp Blatter.
Villar, the acting Uefa president, will be up against Slovenian football association boss Aleksander Ceferin and Dutch football chief Michael van Praag.
The election will be on 14 September.
In November, Villar was fined 25,000 Swiss francs (£19,300) by Fifa and given a warning for failing to co-operate with an inquiry into the bidding processes for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups, which were awarded to Russia and Qatar respectively.
The 66-year-old has been head of the Spanish Football Federation since 1988 and is a Fifa vice-president.
He won 22 caps for Spain during a playing career that included making more than 350 appearances in a 10-year spell at Athletic Bilbao.
