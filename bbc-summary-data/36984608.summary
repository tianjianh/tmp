Kingsmills massacre: Man held in connection with murders is released

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man arrested by detectives investigating the Kingsmills murders has been released pending a report to the Public Prosecution Service.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 59-year-old's arrest in Newry on Friday was the first since police reopened an inquiry into the killings.
He was held on suspicion of the 10 murders and the attempted murder of another man.
The protestant workmen were shot dead by an IRA gang after their mini-bus was stopped near the village of Kingsmills.
Those who were killed were travelling home from work in a textile factory when they were ambushed.
An 11th man, Alan Black, survived despite being seriously injured.
A Catholic man who had been on the bus was ordered to leave before the shootings.
The investigation was reopened shortly after an inquest into the killings was launched, following a 13-year campaign by victims' relatives.
