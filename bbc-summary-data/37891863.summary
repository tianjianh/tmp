The 27-year-old, who can also play at scrum-half, came through Wakefield's academy and left the club in 2013 to join the Giants.
He has also previously had spells at Doncaster, Sheffield and Castleford.
"I am happy to have signed a deal at Wakefield, it is a club that is moving forward both on and off the field after creating a strong squad," said Wood.
