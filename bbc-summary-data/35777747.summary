The 25-year-old began his career at Exeter City, making 141 appearances, before joining the Magpies on a two-year deal last summer.
He moved on loan to Newport County in October, scoring one goal in 15 appearances.
"We have been looking for a defensive midfielder with some aggression," boss Jackie McNamara told BBC Radio York.
Bennett will be available for the Minstermen's home game against Barnet in League Two on Saturday.
