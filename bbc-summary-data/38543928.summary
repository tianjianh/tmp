The condition of a woman seriously injured in the fire which killed her boyfriend has improved, the NHS has confirmed.

Rebecca Williams, known as Bex, was initially in a critical condition when she was taken to hospital after the deliberate New Year's Day fire.
Cameron Logan, 23, died in the blaze at his home in Milngavie, East Dunbartonshire.
Police are treating the case as murder and attempted murder.
Mr Logan's parents were treated for smoke inhalation after the fire, but have since been released from hospital.
Ms Williams, a 24-year-old journalist at Global Radio, is being treated at the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital in Glasgow.
On Friday, her father Phillip Williams posted on Facebook that his daughter was "fighting hard".
Her condition later went from critical to "serious but stable" and NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde confirmed on Sunday that Ms Williams was continuing to improve.
A spokeswoman for the health board said: "Her condition has improved again from yesterday [Saturday]."
The news comes as police stopped and spoke to people near the scene in Achray Place exactly a week after the fire.
Officers spoke to 45 motorists and 10 pedestrians between 06:30 and 08:30 on 8 January.
Police Scotland has urged dog walkers and joggers who were in the area at the time to come forward.
Det Ch Insp Paul Livingstone said Sunday morning's operation had been "very positive".
"We will now assess any new information that could potentially assist with the investigation and help us catch the person responsible for this despicable crime," he said.
"Somebody deliberately set this fire, killing a young man and seriously injuring a young woman, and that person will have had to make their way from the scene in the immediate aftermath.
"If you were in the area around the time of the fire and have not spoken to police, please come forward."
There are more people out and about at seven in the morning than you'd think.
Two private hire cars draw up on Achray Place.
And a group of three young men - perhaps walking home after a night out, or perhaps setting off for the day - walk past the Logan family home, still swathed in tarpaulins.
At the shops on nearby Craigton Road, there were a stream of cars and vans.
Everyone stopped, and the drivers were spoken to.
There are people walking their dogs, and out for a run. Uniformed officers and detectives talk to them, too.
Who are they, and why are they here?
Were they in the area a week ago, at the time the fire was started deliberately?
Did they see anything or anyone, or notice some detail which seems tiny but helps detectives build a complete picture of what was going on at the time the fire was deliberately started?
If often strikes me that detectives on a big inquiry like this must gather vast amounts of information which is fascinating, but ultimately irrelevant to the case.
The reason they do it, of course, is the hope that in amongst all the dross will be some crucial sighting or insight which helps brings the killer or killers to justice.
Det Ch Insp Livingstone said police were still hoping to trace a number of people who were either seen in the area on New Year's Day or were captured on CCTV - including a man and woman who jogging together on Craigton road at about 08:10.
He added: "We are also still looking to speak to a man seen in the Craigton Wood area around the time of the fire walking a brown 'pitbull' type dog, as well as another man walking along Craigton Road onto the West Highland Way with two Springer Spaniels.
"There is no suggestion that any of these people seen in the area around the time of the incident are responsible for the fire, but they could be potential witnesses and it is absolutely vital that we speak to them all as part of our ongoing inquiries."
