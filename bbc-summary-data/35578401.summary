[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A woman was assaulted and robbed in Cardiff after responding to a Gumtree advert for a washing machine.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Police have launched an appeal for witnesses after the "frightening" incident which happened at about 14:15 GMT on Saturday in Spinney Close, Ely.
Two men driving a large white van delivered the washing machine, which officers said was in poor condition and did not work.
They refused to allow her to inspect the item and robbed the 39-year-old.
Ch Insp Joe Jones said: "This was a frightening assault on an innocent female who was responding to an online advertisement in good faith. I urge anyone responding to classified website ads, to do so safely."
