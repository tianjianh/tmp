As well as posing for a selfie with the couple, Hanks told them he was an ordained minister and could help out if necessary.
New York based photographer Meg Miller, who was taking the photographs of the couple, said on Instagram that the accidental meeting was the "icing on the cake" to a beautiful wedding.
