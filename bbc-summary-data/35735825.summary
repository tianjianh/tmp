The 17-year-old was attacked on Brixton Road near Oval tube station last Monday at about 17:30 GMT.
He sustained life-threatening injuries but has since been discharged from hospital, police said.
The Met said it suspected two black males of the stabbing and of assaulting several customers in the Tennessee Chicken Shop earlier that afternoon.
Det Insp Ian Kenward said: "This was a frenzied attack in which a knife was used to inflict life-threatening injuries on a teenage male.
"I have no doubt that the perpetrator intended to cause serious harm to the victim. Police will do everything in their powers to bring the offenders to justice."
The Met is also appealing for any victims in the takeaway shop to contact them as soon as possible.
