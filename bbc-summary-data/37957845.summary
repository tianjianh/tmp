Rachael Buckland, 25, was put in an induced coma after fracturing her skull and suffering a bleed on the brain during the fall at her Cardiff home.
Her former couch Tony Borg said she had surgery on her brain at Cardiff's University Hospital of Wales after she was hurt in October.
"This is a really positive sign and we are naturally delighted," he added.
Mrs Buckland, a mother of two whose husband is Celtic boxing champ Mitchell Buckland, underwent an operation to remove a piece of bone and a damaged part of her brain.
The former bantamweight champion, who is originally from Magor in Monmouthshire, is "awake and can recognise people" as she continues her recovery.
"We didn't think we'd see such positive signs until the new year so Rachael is two months ahead of schedule," added Mr Borg, coach of Welsh world featherweight boxing champion Lee Selby.
"She still has a long way to go but the fact she is already out of her coma, the signs are good. She's definitely showing that fighting spirit."
Friends of Mrs Buckland, who works as a chef at a Newport pub, have raised about Â£6,500 for her family through fundraising events and activities.
