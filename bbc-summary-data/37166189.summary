"As the world's eyes are firmly fixed on Scotland's capital, the city provides the perfect backdrop for three days of exciting and engaging discussion.
"This year's event offers a diverse range of speakers, from Youssou N'Dour to Professor Maamoun Abdulkarim.
"For the first time ever, young people will also be given a prominent voice in the culture summit as part of the youth programme.
"The Scottish government's ambition is for Scotland to be the best place to grow up, with every child being given the best chance to succeed.
"We can all learn from our young people and I look forward to hearing their contributions."
