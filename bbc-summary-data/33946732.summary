Liam Henderson signed a new three-year contract with Celtic before joining Hibernian in a loan deal that has delighted head coach Alan Stubbs.

The season-long move was part of the transfer of fellow midfielder Scott Allan to Celtic for Â£275,000.
"Liam's a good, modern midfielder who can score goals and he has played first-team football for Celtic and Rosenborg," said Stubbs.
"He's one of the best and most talented young players in Scotland."
Hibs had rejected three offers from Rangers for Allan, refusing to sell to their Scottish Championship rivals despite the 23-year-old tabling a transfer request.
Rotherham United had also enquired about the former Dundee United and West Brom midfielder, but the self-confessed Rangers fan did not wish to leave Scotland.
Allan had a year of his Hibs contract to run but could have talked to other clubs in January.
"While we were prepared to allow Scott to run down his contract and play his part in an important season for us, this opportunity provides a really good outcome for everyone," Stubbs told Hibs' website.
"Scott gets a move as he wanted, while we bring in a high-quality player who is motivated to join us as we push for promotion."
Henderson, who was with Hibs' Edinburgh rivals, Hearts, as a youth before moving to Celtic, made his senior debut for the Scottish champions in December 2013.
And the Scotland Under-19 international spent time with Rosenborg, making nine appearances and scoring three times for the Norwegian top-flight club earlier this year.
While Henderson has made only 23 appearances for Celtic, mainly as a  substitute, he has now earned a new contract with the Scottish champions until summer 2018.
"He's an exciting player I rate really highly and I am delighted that he is coming," said Stubbs.
Hibs chief executive Leeann Dempster stressed that her head coach was "happy with the outcome" of the deal that led to Allan departing in exchange for Henderson.
"We have brought in a talented player on a loan for this vital season, plus a fee which will help us strengthen the squad, for the challenging and exciting season that lies ahead," he added.
