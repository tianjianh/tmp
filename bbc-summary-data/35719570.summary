[SN]TITLE[SN]
Teacher who kissed pupil in Dundee nightclub keeps job

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A teacher who kissed a pupil in a Dundee nightclub has been officially reprimanded but will keep his job.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Physical education teacher Graham Hopkins admitted kissing the girl at Liquid Nightclub in December 2014.
The teacher also failed to report to management that the girl and another female, who he knew to be a pupil, were likely to be under 18.
Mr Hopkins also admitted having his photo taken at the nightclub with the pupils and socialising with them.
He waived his right to a full hearing before the General Teaching Council for Scotland (GTSC) and admitted the charges in a written declaration.
Mr Hopkins admitted his fitness to teach had been impaired as a result of the allegations and agreed to the reprimand, which will remain on the GTCS's register of teachers for one year.
