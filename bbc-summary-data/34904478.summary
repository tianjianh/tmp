Lewis Dunne, 16, died in hospital after he was found on a towpath near Burrows Court in Liverpool on 15 November with a single shotgun wound to the back.
A 20-year-old from Anfield and a 21-year-old from Kirkdale are being held in custody, Merseyside Police said.
A 20-year-old man from Everton was bailed after he was arrested last Wednesday on suspicion of murder.
Last week, police said they had ruled out "an arranged fight involving groups on quad bikes" in the area the teenager was shot.
Det Ch Insp Keaton added that officers knew the teenager left home at about 22:15 GMT "to go to a local shop", adding "his friends, his peers and his family are totally bemused as to why this is happened".
