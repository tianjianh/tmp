[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man has died after taking a so-called legal high in Lancashire, police have said.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The man, aged in his 40s, was found dead at a house in Thornton Road, Morecambe, at about 22:00 GMT on Friday.
An investigation is under way after police were called by paramedics.
A woman had also apparently taken the substance but survived and is helping officers with their inquiries, Lancashire Police said.
Legal highs produce the same, or similar effects, to drugs such as cocaine and ecstasy, but are not controlled under the Misuse of Drugs Act.
They cannot be sold for human consumption, but are often given labels such as "plant food" to get around the law.
Recent studies have shown deaths linked to the substances are increasing.
