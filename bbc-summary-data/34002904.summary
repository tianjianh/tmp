Bangkok bomb: Thai police release CCTV timeline of suspect

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Thai police investigating the bomb at a shrine in Bangkok on Monday, which killed 20 people, have released a series of CCTV images showing the movements of their main suspect before and after the bomb detonated.

The footage begins just after 18:36 local time on Monday 17 August. All timings have been adjusted by Thai police to account for discrepancies in the clocks of individual cameras, so the timestamp on the image may differ from the time given by police.
Thai police say this image shows the tuk-tuk (largely obscured) doing a U-turn and pulling up outside the hotel, near the shrine.
18.37.12: Tuk-tuk parks and suspect gets out
18.37.35: Suspect gets backpack out of tuk-tuk
Twelve minutes follow in which the suspect is not caught on CCTV.
The young man is wearing a yellow T-shirt and glasses, and carrying a backpack.
Several cameras track his journey after he leaves the shrine, retracing his steps along the front of the Hyatt Hotel before travelling on the back of a motorcycle.
This is 30 seconds' walk from the previous CCTV image showing him at the Hyatt, but more than a minute later, suggesting he paused around the time the bomb went off.
Police believe he picked up the bike at Soi Mahatlek Luang 1.
Timecode adjustment may be wrong for this image.
After this image police lose track of the suspect.
