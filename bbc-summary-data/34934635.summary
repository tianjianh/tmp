[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A drug dealer has been jailed for life for "the cold-blooded execution" of a man sitting in a car at traffic lights.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Jordan Thomas, 22, was shot twice in the chest on Derek Dooley Way, Sheffield, in 2014. The driver of the car, Neshaun Ferguson, was also shot.
Jama Ahmed, 26, of Broomhall Place, Sheffield, was told he must serve a minimum of 36 years for murder and attempted murder.
The judge said a feud between the pair had "spiralled out of control".
Mr Justice Green described the murder as "cold-blooded execution" and said the effect of Ahmed's crime could not be underestimated.
Sentencing Ahmed, he said: "You brought danger and threat to the citizens of Sheffield".
"The effect of your crime cannot be under-estimated, this feud spiralled out of control".
Sheffield Crown Court had previously heard Mr Thomas was shot by a lone gunman at about 22:15 GMT on 21 December in an attack linked to the fatal stabbing of Mubarak Ali in 2011 by Mr Thomas's cousin, James Knowles.
Ahmed had claimed on the day of the killing he had been watching DVDs at an address in Broomhall before going home.
Asked if he knew who had killed Mr Thomas, he previously told the court: "I would love to know. I'm completely innocent."
Ahmed's co-accused Asif Yousaf, 33, of Violet Bank Road, Sheffield, was found not guilty of murder and attempted murder.
Mr Yousaf's father, Mohammed Yousaf, 61, was found guilty of perverting the course of justice and was given a two-year prison sentence, suspended for two years.
Mohammed Yousaf, also of Violet Bank Road, had initially provided an alibi for his son for the night of Mr Thomas's murder.
However, South Yorkshire Police said forensic enquiries carried out on his phone revealed he was in Leeds at the time and could not have been with his son.
The relatives of Jordan Thomas said his murder had "destroyed us as a family".
A statement read: "Our beautiful boy has gone to heaven without mercy or hesitation.
"Our complete and utter loss has destroyed us as a family.
"We will never come to terms with his death."
