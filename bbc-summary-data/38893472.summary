The shots went through a lounge window and the front door was set alight in Whinfield Road in Thornton at about 19:30 GMT on Monday.
No-one was in the lounge at the time and officers believe the attack was a case of mistaken identity.
Merseyside Police said the family were "new to the street" and are hunting the offenders, who fled in a white car.
Ch Insp Mark Morgan said: "Criminals who choose to use weapons do not care about putting other people at risk or the fear they bring to their own communities.
"There were children in this house, including a very young baby. The actions of those responsible were hugely reckless and we could easily have been dealing with a far more serious incident."
Police said recently that there had been an escalation in gang violence, including two murders.
Aaron Lewis, 26, was shot three times outside a chip shop in Wavertree while Thomas Baker, 44, was shot in the head at Old Swan meat market.
