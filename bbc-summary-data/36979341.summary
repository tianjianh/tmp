Bennett, 66, succeeded Steve McNamara as the national team boss in February of this year, on the back of an autumn Test series win against New Zealand.
England take on Australia, New Zealand and Scotland in the Four Nations later this year.
The opening Test comes against the Kiwis in Huddersfield on 29 October.
"This is my first opportunity to see the squad in action and I feel an away game is good preparation to see how everyone comes together in a new environment," Bennett said.
Avignon, in France's southern rugby league heartland, has staged many internationals with England's last visit resulting in a 32-18 victory back in 2011.
