Andrew McCornick, a livestock farmer from near Dumfries, replaces Allan Bowie who has served two years.
The role of president is an important one, acting as a liaison with government ministers.
Mr McCornick said the role would be essential over the next two years to fill the "vacuum" created by Brexit.
Gary Mitchell of Stoneykirk, near Stranraer, and Martin Kennedy, from Aberfeldy, were elected his vice presidents.
Mr McCornick told BBC Scotland: "I want to see us looking for a real strategy for this Brexit situation.
"I am going to make sure that we are there to deliver for farmers.
"I want us to be a profitable, sustainable industry.  We need to get (Brexit) negotiators to understand this industry.
"I would like to see us moving to a properly rewarded industry."
