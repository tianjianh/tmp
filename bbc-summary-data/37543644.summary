[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
About 2,000 delegates from 50 countries are expected to attend the conference in Reykjavik, which is concerned with the development and protection of the Arctic region.
Other speakers include United Nations Secretary General Ban Ki-moon.
Ms Sturgeon said Scotland had "a strong commitment" to tackling climate change.
The first minister was invited to the event by former President of Iceland Ã“lafur Ragnar GrÃ­msson following the Paris Climate Change talks in 2015, and will take part in a full day of meetings and engagements.
She said climate change was "one of the biggest challenges the world faces".
She added: "It's a welcome step forward that EU members ratified the Paris Agreement last week.
"I'll outline the steps Scotland is taking to cut emissions and how we want to use our position as a world leader to work with other like-minded countries and limit the effects of climate change in the coming decades."
