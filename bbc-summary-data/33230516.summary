He will appear opposite Hiddleston in a restaurant scene.
The book tells the story of a former British soldier who becomes embroiled in the arms trade.
It also stars Hugh Laurie, Olivia Colman and Tom Hollander and is the first television adaptation of a le CarrÃ© novel in more than 20 years.
Le Carre also made a brief appearance in a Christmas party scene in the recent film adaptation of his novel Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy, starring Gary Oldman in 2011.
Filming started on The Night Manager this spring and the mini-series will be broadcast in 2016.
It will be a contemporary interpretation of the book in which Hiddleston will play British soldier Jonathan Pine.
He is recruited by an intelligence operative, played by Colman, to navigate the shadowy recesses of Whitehall and Washington and infiltrate the inner circle of an arms dealer played by Laurie.
The book has been translated into more than 20 languages and sold more than one million copies in north America alone since it was published in 1993.
