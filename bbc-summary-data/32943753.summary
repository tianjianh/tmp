The collection of items from the British Museum is being exhibited at Segedunum Roman Fort in Wallsend.
Organisers say it aims to explore the story of one of the world's most powerful empires.
Highlights include sculptures, coins, jewellery and items of clothing in a "near-perfect" condition.
Iain Watson, director of Tyne & Wear Archives & Museums said hosting the touring exhibition at "what was once the edge of the Roman frontier" was "particularly special".
North Tyneside Councillor Eddie Darke said the exhibits provided "a window into the lives of previous Wallsend residents."
Roman Empire: Power & People runs from 30 May to 13 September.
