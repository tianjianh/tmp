The use of internet banking on a computer has fallen for the first time, as users switch to mobile apps.

On average, customers logged on to banking websites 4.3m times a day in 2015, down from 4.4m in 2014, according to the British Bankers Association (BBA).
At the same time the use of apps - on phones and tablets - went up from 7m logins a day in 2014, to 11m last year.
In total, customers used such apps 4bn times in 2015, the BBA said.
"Customers love the new technology that is allowing us to bank round the clock," said Anthony Browne, the BBA's chief executive.
"You can set up standing orders while standing in the queue for the bus and check your balance while checking in at the airport."
However, when it comes to actual payments, people are still more likely to use a computer rather than an app.
In 2015 there were 417m internet payments, compared to 347m payments on an app.
One reason for that is that most customers still have to log in to their bank's website if they want to set up a payment to a new person.
However new app-based banks, like Atom, Starling and Tandem, are making it easier to carry out the full range of transactions while on the move.
The number of payments via app rose by 54% last year, while payments via websites rose by just 2%.
