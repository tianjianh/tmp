A mural of David Bowie that became a shrine to the musician after his death is to be listed by the council to ensure its long-term protection.

The mural is on the side of Morleys department store in Brixton, the south London area where the star was born.
Lambeth Council has said it is discussing with Bowie's family the possibility of a permanent memorial.
Suggestions include renaming Tunstall Place, where the mural is sited, and a statue to the musician.
"It is ultimately the family's decision as to what may be appropriate," said Councillor Lib Peck, leader of Lambeth Council.
"We must respect that and be patient. Lambeth residents have been overwhelmed by the outpouring of affection visibly demonstrated by floral tributes, messages and people visiting the Bowie mural to pay their respects to this unique 'Brixton boy'.
"We are also in contact with the Bowie fan club and other Brixton organisations who want to honour the memory and legacy of this extraordinary artist.
"We will share any word we get from his family that will determine what we do next," she added.
The council said it would preserve messages left on the brick wall next to the mural, and drawings and cards would be transferred to the council archives. Any remaining flowers near the mural will be removed next week, it said.
Bowie died from cancer in January at the age of 69.
The mural was created by Australian artist Jimmy C in 2013 after researching Bowie's life.
"There's not much street art out here, not compared to east London where I normally paint," he told Brixton Bugle newspaper.
"I found the wall and got the go-ahead from Morleys."
