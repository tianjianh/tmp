Birmingham City Ladies' England internationals Jade Moore and Jo Potter have left Damson Park with immediate effect after buying out their contracts with the Women's Super League club.

Moore, 25, and Potter, 31, both had six months left on their respective deals.
A club statement confirmed: "The players approached the club during the mid-season break to negotiate buying out their remaining six months.
"The negotiations represent an excellent deal for the club."
The statement added: "Although some fans might be disappointed with the news, the club are extremely happy with the deal that was reached which will benefit the team's development, and also assist off-the-pitch activities, as we move forward with our new vision for the future."
No indication has yet been given by Blues as to which other club they are likely to join.
Mansfield-born Potter, who has won 21 caps, was in her third stay with Blues, having returned to the club in 2009.
She has also played for Chesterfield, Sheffield Wednesday, Arsenal, Charlton Athletic, Everton and Leicester City.
Worksop-born Moore, who has won 16 England caps, joined Blues from Leeds United in 2011, having previously played for Lincoln City.
Blues have counterbalanced the loss of Moore and Potter by making two further foreign signings during the mid-season break.
Norwegian midfielder Andrine Hegerberg's arrival followed German striker Isabelle Linden from Champions League holders FFC Frankfurt.
Blues have also signed full-back Corina Schroder from Liverpool and defender Marisa Ewers from Bayer Leverkusen since the turn of the year.
