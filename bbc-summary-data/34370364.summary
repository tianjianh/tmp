Alan Cochrane: I'm not just a Tory

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Alan Cochrane is the Scottish editor of the Telegraph  - but he's a lot more than that.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
During the referendum campaign he was one of the most fervent defenders of the Union. Why did he feel so passionately about the subject?
Does he believe Unionists won the referendum only to lose the aftermath? And does he think he overstepped the mark as a journalist in his zeal to keep the UK together?
These are some of the issues addressed in the last of our four radio interviews to mark the anniversary of the referendum.
I wanted to talk to Alan Cochrane because in a way he is similar to the first of our interviewees, Lesley Riddoch. Each of them reported on the events of the campaign. But they also developed a burning desire to be part of it.
Cochrane said he was considered as a special adviser to David Cameron before the referendum began. But he protested - if with somewhat weary resignation - that it is not fair when he is simply labelled a Tory.
"My kids, I've got four, don't know how I vote and I don't tell them how I vote," he said. "And sometimes I've voted Tory and sometimes I haven't. (I've voted for) all of them. Well, not Tommy's lot - but I like Tommy (Sheridan).
"I suppose it's other people's perception. For instance, I've supported just about all of the SNP's big ticket issues in this parliament - or in recent years - other than independence and education.
"I've supported them on Megrahi, there's the business of raising the price of alcohol, I've supported them on that, there's abolishing six month sentences, all of those I've supported."
But did he overstep the mark during the referendum campaign? In his book Alex Salmond - My Part in His Downfall, Cochrane discusses how he did not publish a column attacking Downing Street after Alistair Darling, the leader of Better Together, said it would not be helpful to the No campaign.
When I asked him about this, Cochrane was indignant: "I find it appallingly hypocritical to talk about this trade as if it's some kind of vocation, like the priesthood.
"I didn't not publish it because I was asked to. I didn't do it because I thought it would harm the cause which I thought was much more important than being a journalist. And that cause was keeping the United Kingdom together."
As for more recent developments, he is not much more impressed than he was by the performance of the Unionist parties during the referendum campaign.
On Kezia Dugdale's suggestion that Labour MPs and MSPs should have a free vote if there is another referendum, he had this to say: "I do think that Labour is a unionist party or its nothing.
"And the idea that you can pick and mix on an issue as important as the United Kingdom is, well it's a sign of total desperation. And if members of her party - well, I suspect she hasn't got many members of her party that think that, because they've all joined the SNP."
It is a marked contrast to his views on Nicola Sturgeon, whom he describes as a "cracking politician".
The full interview with Alan Cochrane will be broadcast on this week's Sunday Good Morning Scotland. That's on Sunday, on BBC Radio Scotland from 0800.
