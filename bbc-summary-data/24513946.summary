Wrecking Ball beat Eminem's Berzerk to the top spot of the singles chart.
Meanwhile, Cyrus's album Bangerz also beat Chase & Status' Brand New Machine into second place.
The last act to achieve the chart double was Olly Murs, with his single Troublemaker and album Right Place, Right Time, last December.
"I truly appreciate the love I'm getting from the UK," the singer said. "Not only is this my second Number 1 single, but even more amazing is my album has also gone in at Number 1. I can't wait to be back in the UK next month."
Cyrus has barely been out of the headlines since her risque performance at the MTV VMA's in August, when her suggestive dancing in a nude bikini with singer Robin Thicke drew complaints.
She has worn revealing outfits in a number of further performances and got into a row with Sinead O'Connor, who wrote an open letter to Cyrus warning her not to be exploited by the music business
Wrecking Ball is the former Disney star's second number one UK single, after We Can't Stop topped the chart in the summer.
Other new entries into the singles chart included Conor Maynard at four with R U Crazy, and The Saturdays at five with Disco Love.
James Blunt achieved his first top 10 single in six years with Bonfire Heart. The track entered the chart at six while John Newman's song Cheating entered at nine.
Justin Bieber failed to make the top 10 with Heartbreaker, which was new in at number 14.
