Head coach Andrew McDonald says Leicestershire will continue to adopt a brave approach to their Division Two Championship campaign after drawing their opening fixture.

Leicestershire were on the back foot for most of the match against Glamorgan before earning a comfortable draw.
"Sometimes in four-day cricket you have to be prepared to lose to win," McDonald told BBC Radio Leicester.
"That is our mentality. We want to put this team in positions to win games."
Leicestershire have not won in the County Championship for two full seasons, a run of 33 games since beating Gloucestershire in September 2012.
Former Australia all-rounder McDonald, who took over in the close season, added: "It's a positive start but we can always improve and we are stepping in the right direction.
"They drove the game and they were always in control.
"We are trying to get the team to play with a style of play that we want that is going to try to win games."
Meanwhile, McDonald has confirmed seam bowler Clint McKay will be available for their second Championship match, away to Kent, which starts on Sunday, 3 May.
"He flies in on Sunday so will have a week to prepare," McDonald said of his fellow Australian.
Also, the club will assess the fitness of fast bowler Atif Sheik, who left the field during Glamorgan's second innings with a shoulder problem, and all-rounder Rob Taylor, who missed the game against the Welsh county after suffering back spasms.
