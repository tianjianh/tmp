[SN]TITLE[SN]
Blackburn Rovers 0-1 Sheffield Wednesday

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Sheffield Wednesday earned their first away league win of the season with a hard-fought victory at Blackburn.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Owls took the lead when Steven Fletcher's shot from outside the box took a deflection and found the left-hand corner of Jason Steele's goal.
Marvin Emnes could have equalised for Rovers before half-time, but his shot was saved by Keiren Westwood.
Emnes did put the ball into the net in the second half, but the goal was ruled out for offside.
Kieran Lee also had a chance to double the visitors' lead late on after being played through by Barry Bannan, but his shot was saved by Steele.
The result means Wednesday have now won four of their past five league games, having ended a run of seven away fixtures without a win going back to last season.
Blackburn mustered only two shots on target as they slumped back into the relegation zone with eight points from their opening 10 league matches under manager Owen Coyle.
