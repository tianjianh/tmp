[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A patient at a Wirral hospital died from meningitis shortly after doctors allegedly mistook his symptoms for alcoholism, a report has revealed.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The man, only identified as Mr J, was taken to Arrowe Park Hospital in 2013 after a fit but died two days later.
While there were a "number of missed opportunities", a Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman report found his death was "probably unavoidable".
The hospital's trust apologised for the failings in the patient's care.
News of Mr J's death and the subsequent investigation follows the publication of a report from the health watchdog which detailed more than 160 investigations it had carried out nationwide.
Mr J, who was in his 30s, had been due to start an alcohol rehabilitation programme when he was found in his bedroom and taken to A&E by ambulance, the report said.
"Mr J's family say that from the outset they heard staff imply in their comments that his condition was probably related to alcohol use," the report went on.
When he was triaged upon arrival, his diagnosis was alcohol withdrawal and a head injury with confusion.
He was given medication for symptoms of alcohol withdrawal and also diagnosed with a possible chest infection, the report said.
His condition deteriorated and he was taken to the high dependency unit, where he was diagnosed with bacterial meningitis. He was declared dead two days later.
The Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman found there were "delays in triage and lost opportunities in A&E for earlier medical review" and found "significant failings" in his care.
Wirral University Teaching Hospital NHS Foundation Trust was also investigated after nurses failed to notice an older patient was "deteriorating" and developed a pressure sore.
The watchdog found she suffered "pain and discomfort which could have been avoided".
In a statement, the trust said: "The delivery of safe, high-quality patient care is our highest priority. The trust embraces concerns and complaints as an opportunity to learn and improve the care and service we provide.
"We acknowledge that in both cases there were failures in the care provided and we would like to reiterate our sincere apologies to the complainants and their families for this."
