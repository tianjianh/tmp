[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The decision behind changes to a central Swansea road where a man died after being hit by a bus must be explained, a coroner has said.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Daniel Foss, 37, from Reynoldston, Gower, was struck by a National Express bus on The Kingsway in September 2013.
Acting senior Swansea coroner Colin Phillips ordered Swansea council to provide safety reports on The Kingsway at a pre-inquest hearing on Thursday.
A full inquest is due to be heard at the end of July.
Sgt Louise Lucas, 41, a mother-of-three and an off-duty police officer, died after she was hit by a bus on The Kingsway on 31 March.
Her death triggered a series of changes on the city centre road, with added safety barriers installed and east-bound traffic suspended.
The coroner asked bus company, First Cymru, to provide a statement relating to about 100 traffic "incidents" on the Kingsway since 2008.
Mr Phillips said the metro system seemed "counterintuitive" but added the outcome of safety audits would be required before he made any formal finding.
