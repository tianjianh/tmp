[SN]TITLE[SN]
Cornwall Council 4% tax rise approved by councillors

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A council tax rise of almost 4% has been approved by councillors in Cornwall.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Cornwall Council's 3.97% increase is the maximum allowed without triggering a local referendum under government rules.
It is made of a 1.97% rise in council tax and a 2% increase to specifically fund adult social care.
At County Hall in Truro, 67 councillors voted in favour of the rise, 13 were against and there were 21 abstentions.
It means the council tax bill of the average band D property will increase by Â£50 a year, the authority said.
In November, the government announced it would allow local authorities in England to increase council tax by 2% to cover a funding shortfall in adult social care.
In 2014, the council approved a four-year budget strategy aimed at cutting spending by nearly Â£200m.
