Bromley 2-1 Woking

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Lee Minshull scored a last-gasp winner as Bromley came from behind to beat Woking on home turf.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Cardinals were ahead inside three minutes when Fabio Saraiva charged through and fired a shot into the bottom corner from 25 yards.
However, Neil Smith's men rallied and got their reward when Tobi Sho-Silva cut the ball back for Blair Turgott to shoot home for the equaliser.
In a tight second half, substitute Daniel Ajakaiye hit the side netting from a favourable position as the Ravens pushed for a winner.
But another substitute, Minshull, forced the ball in from a 89th-minute corner, to widespread jubilation at Hayes Lane.
