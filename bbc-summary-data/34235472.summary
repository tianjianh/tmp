The total scores of Abbey Ling, Kirsty Barr and Charlotte Kerwood took them onto 203, two points clear of second-placed Finland, with Russia in third.
None of the trio managed to secure individual medals.
"To be stood on top of the podium and hear the national anthem playing is the best feeling in the world," said Kerwood.
After securing 69 out of 75 in the opening rounds, Kerwood and Barr did make a six athlete shoot-off to decide which one shooter would proceed to the semi-finals but neither were successful.
Spain's Fatima Galvez eventually came out on top.
