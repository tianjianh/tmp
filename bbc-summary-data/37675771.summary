Southern: £2,000 lump sum back on table to end dispute

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Southern has told union members a lump sum of £2,000 is back on the table if they end a dispute over conductors.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The rail operator has urged the RMT, which is planning another 11 days of strikes before Christmas, to put its offer to a referendum of its members.
Southern said increasing numbers of staff were turning up to work during strikes.
The £2,000 lump sum was originally offered if conductors accepted new contracts by 6 October.
Charles Horton, chief executive of Southern's owner Govia Thameslink Railway (GTR), said: "Everyone wants to see an end to this dispute but it is clear that there is currently little prospect of a negotiated settlement between us, however much we've tried."
"There is a full and fair offer on the table and it's time to stop the strikes and move forward," he added.
However, the RMT said the renewed offer did not move the dispute on "a single inch".
"Southern have rehashed the £2,000 bribe to our members even though the company have been told repeatedly that money is not the issue and that the safety of passengers and staff is not for sale," said general secretary Mick Cash.
"The RMT disputes the bogus figures on the number of staff working.
"Our reps at all locations report that morale is high and that support for the strike action remain rock solid."
Southern is introducing driver-only operated trains and has offered existing conductors new roles as on-board supervisors.
The company's offer comes after a pensioners' group warned driver-only trains that stop at unstaffed stations could be committing an offence under the Equality Act.
The National Pensioners Convention (NPC) said a "mystery traveller" experiment in August revealed problems for pensioners or passengers with mobility problems.
The NPC said "mystery travellers" including a wheelchair user, a blind passenger and a pensioner took a series of train journeys on Southern from East Croydon to Chichester and back to test the practicalities of travel.
Its report highlighted concerns over the lack of toilets on some trains, the absence of a ramp at one station, lack of platform staff and poorly-sited help points.
Dot Gibson, NPC general secretary, said: "Our concern is that if a driver-only train runs to an unstaffed station with a passenger who is unable to exit the train unassisted, an offence will be committed under the Equality Act 2010 by putting that person at a substantial disadvantage."
A spokesman for Southern said the new on-board supervisor role provided the opportunity to improve support for disabled passengers.
"All staff will have dedicated accessibility training supported by new ways of working across teams," a spokesman said.
"In line with the requirements of the Equality Act 2010, adjustments will be in place to ensure that any passenger requiring accessibility assistance to reach an unmanned/partially manned station will be supported in doing so without unreasonable delay or inconvenience."
