[SN]TITLE[SN]
Portsmouth 1-2 Doncaster Rovers

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
First-half goals from John Marquis and Andy Williams helped Doncaster to a 2-1 win against Portsmouth at Fratton Park.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Striker Marquis gave Doncaster a seventh-minute lead when he latched onto a long ball down the middle and rounded David Forde to slot into an empty goal.
It was the third home game in a row in which Pompey had fallen behind and Williams cleverly clipped over his shoulder to double the lead.
Pompey hit back hard and Carl Baker's powerful dipping effort from the edge of the area needed a top save from Marko Marosi to tip over before Doncaster left-back Cedric Evina almost fired into his own goal.

Pompey were given a first-half lifeline when Joe Wright bizarrely hooked Gareth Evans' wayward cross into Baker's path and the winger thumped in.
Conor Chaplin failed to crane his header into an open goal, Baker dragged a long ball onto the bar and Curtis Main air-kicked under the bar.
But the best chance was kicked off the line by Andy Butler after Gary Roberts had headed towards goal as Pompey fell to a second straight defeat.
