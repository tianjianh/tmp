New conditions for Birmingham drug death nightclub

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A nightclub has been made subject to strict new conditions, following the death of a teenager caused by a contaminated batch of drugs.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Dylan Booth, 18, from Solihull, died in hospital after taking the substance at the Rainbow in the Digbeth area of Birmingham on New Years's Eve.
Three men and a woman were also taken ill but have since recovered.
A city council licensing hearing stipulated the club must employ under-cover security staff and sniffer dogs.
Other conditions include extra drugs signage and more stringent identity checks.
A full licensing review is due next month.
