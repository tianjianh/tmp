Andrew Green, 33, was last seen driving away from Yew Tree Farm in Chorley, near Bridgnorth, on 22 June.
About 70 people searched an area around the farm on Saturday at the request of this family.
About 50 took part in a second search in an area further away from his home on Sunday.
Mr Green's mother, Julie Green, said she was delighted so many people gave up their time to take part.
"I can't describe how wonderful everyone has been," she said.
Mr Green was last seen by his partner after putting his two young daughters to bed.
He had been going through the breakdown of a relationship.
His car was found abandoned a mile from his home.
More than 500 acres were covered during the search on Sunday.
Mrs Green said it was emotionally challenging.
"It's hard, but I have just got to stay strong," she said. "I keep hoping and praying he comes home or we find him."
