Officers issued 57 warnings for speeding in addition to 43 fines after patrols on "collision hotspots" in the region.
Two motorists were fined for driving at 54mph and 52mph respectively in a 30mph limit area.
The patrol focused on rural roads, including the A84/A85/A82 corridor.
More than 120 motorists were stopped during the operation.
Two cars were seized for lack of insurance and another motorist was fined for not having a valid MOT.
Five drivers were also found to have no vehicle tax on their cars.

"We will however continue to use all means at our disposal to deal with inappropriate or dangerous behaviour by all road users."
