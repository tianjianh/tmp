[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Hundreds of acres of a headland in north Cornwall have gone up for sale.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 217 acres of Trevose Head were part of an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty and has been in the same family since about 1900, estate agents Lodge and Thomas said.
The sale of the land, either in its entirety or in plots, is expected to raise between £3-4m, they added.
The headland, near Padstow, comprises 137 acres of agricultural land and about 80 acres of rough grazing.
It takes in Barras Bay, plus parts of Mother Ivey's and Booby's Bay. It also provides access to the local RNLI lifeboat station and Trevose Head lighthouse, which is operated by Trinity House.
Part of South West Coast Path also crosses it.
Estate agent Tim Ryland said there already has been "a number" of expressions of interest in the land, which is open to offers.
He added: "It's a very unusual piece of land.
"There are very few properties on the headland itself. There's the lighthouse, the lifeboat station and only two or three houses."
