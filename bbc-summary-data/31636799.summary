What are you doing for Comic Relief this year?

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Got a face? Fancy making it funny for charity?

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
This year's Comic Relief is all about making your face funny for money.
Red Nose Day takes place on 13 March and thousands of people all over the country will be trying to make their mates chuckle with a funny face.
It's to raise money to help millions of disadvantaged people, both at home in the UK and across Africa too.
Maisie's taken a silly selfie and is wearing her special Comic Relief onesie. Children at her school are all dressing up too.
So what are you getting up to? How will you be making your face funny for money?
Send us a picture to newsroundpix@bbc.co.uk
Please ask a parent, teacher or guardian and get their permission to send us a picture and send their phone number so we can speak to them if we want to use it on the website or the programme.
Whatever you're up to, let us know. We might feature you on Newsround! Don't forget to give us the name and number of an adult who's helping organise what you're doing - perhaps a parent or a teacher.
Send us an email to newsroundcomments@bbc.co.uk and tell us what you're doing to raise money!
