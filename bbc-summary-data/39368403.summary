Bus Éireann strike: Cross-border services may be hit

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Some cross-border bus services are expected to be affected by industrial action in the Republic of Ireland.

Workers at Bus Éireann have called an all-out strike from midnight on Thursday.
Northern Ireland bus operator Translink said the X1 and X3 services it operates with Bus Éireann will be subject to disruption.
Passengers are advised to refer to the Translink website.
The X1 runs from Belfast to Dublin via Dublin Airport, and the X3 from Londonderry to Dublin via the airport.
Translink's own Dublin Goldline services, the X2 and X4 from Belfast and Londonderry respectively will operate according to the usual timetable.
The company has advised travellers that these services will not pick-up and drop-off from Dublin's Busáras bus station but from the adjacent Connolly railway station.
"To lessen the impact on cross-border travellers, we are working closely with Northern Ireland Railways to offer alternative means of travel to Dublin," a Translink spokesperson said.
Representatives of the five Bus Éireann unions took the decision to strike following the management's decision to implement cost-saving measures without their agreement.
The company said the strike was extremely disappointing and would only worsen its already difficult financial crisis.
