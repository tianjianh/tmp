[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Stephanie Beacham is to play Princess Margaret in a new play inspired by real events.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The production, set in Kensington Palace in 1993, sees Margaret going through bags of royal correspondence with the intention of burning them.
When an ex-gangster arrives, the Queen's sister has the choice "to make or break her family yet again".
A Princess Undone, by Richard Stirling, will have its world premiere at Cambridge Arts Theatre on 19 October.
Directed by Matthew Gould, it will feature Beacham in an exact copy of Princess Margaret's Poltimore tiara - worn by the princess on her wedding day.
"She was Diana before Diana, and it must have been difficult," Beacham told the Daily Mail's Baz Bamigboye. "It's always difficult being second fiddle."
Princess Margaret died in 2002.
Beacham's television work includes The Colbys, Dynasty, Bad Girls and Coronation Street. More recently she has appeared in Trollied and Boomers.
The cast also includes Emmerdale and Waterloo Road actor Jason Merrells as ex-gangster John Bindon.
The play will tour in November to the Devonshire Park Theatre in Eastbourne and Guildford's Yvonne Arnaud Theatre.
