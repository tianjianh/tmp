Bristol flanker Jack Lam has signed a new two-year contract with the Championship club until 2018.

Lam, 28, joined the club in 2014 and, despite missing out on promotion to the Premiership, the Samoa forward has ignored interest elsewhere to re-sign.
He says the challenge of getting the club into the top flight was one he could not walk away from after their play-off loss to Worcester in May.
"I feel I've got unfinished business here," Lam told BBC Radio Bristol.
"There is a lot of talent here and massive potential at the club and I'll probably see my years out here. I couldn't see myself leaving the club and not helping them get up into the top flight.
"I've made some really good friendships in the team, the supporters are unreal and playing at Ashton Gate is a top facility."
Lam, who was part of Samoa's World Cup squad, says he could have signed elsewhere but ultimately thinks he will end his career at the club.
"I got a couple of approaches from other clubs but I couldn't see myself leaving having not helped them get promoted," he said. "Bristol is a home away from home and everyone here has made me feel very welcome.
"I'm not getting any younger, two more years takes me up to 30 and then I'll have to start thinking about what I do after rugby. There are not too many years left in me and I'd like to see my years out at Bristol."
And Lam, who has scored 12 tries in 17 appearances, says securing promotion would be one of the greatest achievements of his career.
"It would be massive, you go through a career without any silverware, that would hopefully be my first and it'll be one of biggest achievements in my rugby career," he added.
