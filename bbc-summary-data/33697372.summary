[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Building work on the billion pound Sherford development near Plymouth will begin soon with 580 houses.
The town will have four schools, a library, GP surgery, town hall, community centres and parks.
Some local people have raised concerns the development does not contain an ambulance station and that local hospitals will struggle to cope.
The developers, the Sherford Consortium, claim the new community will inject Â£2bn into the local economy.
South Hams District Council and Plymouth City Council granted permission for the first phase.
Leader of South Hams District Council John Tucker said: "This advanced step in planning approval is a milestone which marks the real beginning of Sherford as a town, bringing much needed housing and jobs to the area."
