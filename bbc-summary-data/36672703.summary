The 34-year-old has featured in two World Cups and played 121 top-flight matches in seven years at Northampton.
Tonga'uiha, who has also played for Bedford and Racing Metro, moves back to England after two seasons with Oyonnax.
"I'm looking forward to playing in the Premiership again, a hugely competitive league," he told the club website.
"Bristol Rugby is a good place to be - there's a buzz around the place ahead of the new season and I'm excited to be involved."
Director of rugby Andy Robinson says Tonga'uiha will "provide excellent guidance" for a club that is making its Premiership return after a seven-year absence.
"Soane has a wealth of experience and has proven himself to be a consistent performer at the highest level," Robinson added.
Bristol, who were drawn in the same Challenge Cup Pool as West Country rivals Bath on Wednesday, have also already added Saints back row Jon Fisher to their squad ahead of the 2016-17 season.
