Griff Rhys Jones to return to West End

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Griff Rhys Jones is to return to the West End for the first time in five years in a new production of The Miser.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Moliere's classic five-act comedy has been newly adapted by Phil Porter and Sean Foley, who will also direct it.
The production will visit Richmond and Bath before opening at London's Garrick Theatre in March 2017.
It's one of two new productions directed by Foley to open in the next year, together with Ronald Harwood's The Dresser.
The revival of The Dresser, which will star Ken Stott and Reece Shearsmith, is due to open at the Duke of York's Theatre in October.
It was first performed in the West End and on Broadway in 1980.
Set in a regional theatre in wartime, the play tells the story of an an ageing actor-manager and his long-suffering dresser as they struggle to keep a show running.
