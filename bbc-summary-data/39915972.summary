The club's board will begin discussions on Monday over McCulloch's future - he has been in charge since Lee Clark left for Bury in February.
The Rugby Park side ensured their Scottish Premiership survival with Saturday's win over Inverness CT.
"I've always said that when we're safe, I imagine a meeting will happen," McCulloch said after the victory.
The former Rangers, Wigan and Motherwell player has won four of his 12 games at the helm - all in the league - and has lost and drawn the same number.
"We've not spoken for two-to-three months, so I don't want to get carried away," he added. "I just want to concentrate on this performance - it's our 25th consecutive season in the top flight.
"I'm not a big-headed guy or a talker. Once we sit down we'll have discussions, that's all I can say. It's probably best we do it sooner rather than later.
"I've surprised myself a little bit. But with the managers I've worked under and players I've worked with, I've not got bad experience. It's literally one day at a time and that's the best way to continue to be."
