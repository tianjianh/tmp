[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Thousands of Opel Zafira B models in Ireland have been recalled for a second time over an engine problem that has caused some cars to burst into flames.

About 8,200 cars were recalled last November after problems were identified with the improper repair of the resistor's thermal fuse.
On Thursday, Opel said the resistor thermal fuse and the blower motors in all vehicles would be replaced.
A total of 234,938 Vauxhall Zafiras have also been recalled across the UK.
In the recall last year, the resistors in all cars were replaced along with any corroded blower motors.
This latest recall will see all cars fitted with a brand new wax fuse resistor and the blower motors on all cars will be replaced.
In a statement, Opel, which trades under the brand name Vauxhall in the UK, said customers would be contacted to bring their cars back to Opel dealerships so that "preventative action" could be carried out.
"While the current action achieves the objective of returning vehicles to their original condition, after extensive investigations we have decided to go further and improve the overall robustness of the system," the company said.
"We will therefore be initiating a second recall to replace the current soldered fuse resistor with a wax fuse resistor so reducing the opportunity for manipulation.
"When the recalls are complete, all vehicles will have a new wax fuse resistor, a new blower motor and a new moulding at the base of the windscreen to address water ingress.
"Again, this work will be conducted free of charge."
Last year, Vauxhall said it was taking "preventative action" after originally recalling the Zafira B.
