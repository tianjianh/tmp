[SN]TITLE[SN]
Kingsmills massacre inquest adjourned for eighth time

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The families of the Kingmills massacre victims have said they are disappointed at the eighth adjournment of an inquest into the 1976 atrocity.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
IRA members ambushed a mini-bus carrying the men in County Armagh and shot dead 10 of them after checking they were Protestants.
Alan Black, who survived, said the latest delay was like groundhog day.
The families said they are concerned at the imminent retirement of coroner John Leckey without a replacement appointed.
They said they would be taking a judicial review into that.
The families also highlighted the failure of the Garda Síochána (Irish police) to supply relevant documents, despite assurances from the Taoiseach Enda Kenny earlier this year.
Kingsmills is among dozens of inquests dating from the early days of the Troubles that face delay because not enough money is available to investigate or there is nobody to oversee fresh hearings.
