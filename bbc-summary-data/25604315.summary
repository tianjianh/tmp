Scottish Championship ins and outs - January 2014

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Livingston were the only club in the Scottish Championship to see major money change hands during the January transfer window.

While the West Lothian club's coffers benefitted, their fans have lost the pleasure of witnessing at close hand the further development of midfielder Stefan Scougall, who was sold to Sheffield United, and defender Coll Donaldson, who was bought by Queens Park Rangers.
The Championship's talent pool was, however, bolstered by the continued filtering down of players with top-flight experience ejected, partly, as a result of squad cost-cutting.
Hamilton Academical's capture of Jason Scotland after the former Dundee United and St Johnstone forward's release from Barnsley appears to be the biggest coup, albeit he is in the twilight of his career, while title rivals Dundee will hope to resurrect the career of former Hearts striker Christian Nade
The fear of relegation - and missing out from the likely cash bonanza of playing Rangers and Hearts next season - meant the biggest turnaround of players was at Greenock Morton, Cowdenbeath and Livingston as they battle it out at the foot of the table.
New Morton manager Kenny Shiels attempted to conjure up what would be a major escape act with the introduction of striker Rowan Vine and midfielder David Robertson from Hibernian and St Johnstone respectively.
However, while he has improved the bottom side's form, the teams above them have continued to pick up points as well.
