An investigation has been launched following claims some schoolchildren had already seen an 11-plus exam paper before taking the test.

GL Assessment, who provide the tests, said it was investigating the "possible breach of security" in Plymouth, Devon.
Some pupils sitting the English exam later told their parents they had already seen the paper, it is alleged.
GL Assessment said "extensive security measures" were in place to prevent exam papers being leaked.
Hundreds of pupils sit the paper every year to try and gain a place at one of the city's three grammar schools.
Parent Louise Higgins said: "It's a big shame that we can't now relax because we were looking forward to it being all over and done with. What will happen? Will we have to retake? Will there be a delay in the results? It will have an impact on us going forward."
Mum Caroline Tall added: "At first I thought it was just a rumour, but to think it could be true is very concerning to me."
A spokesperson for Plymouth City Council confirmed they were working with GL Assessment (GLA) to explore if there were any irregularities with the 11-plus exam.
A spokesperson for GLA said: "While the potential for a leak is extremely remote, we take any suggestion of a breach very seriously."
