Collins, 66, who has difficulty walking following back surgery, suffered a severe gash near his eye after falling on the way to the toilet.
His management said he had stitches in hospital for the cut, and will be kept under observation for 24 hours.
The shows were meant to take place on 8 and 9 June and have now been rescheduled for November.

Another, who was at Wednesday's gig, added: " Amazing night last night!!! What a fantastic fan base you have. Get well very soon xxxxxxxx."
His management's post on Facebook added that the singer hit his head on a chair when he fell in the middle of the night, but is "recovering well". He will be kept under observation for 24 hours.
The singer, whose condition is described as "drop foot", sent "sincere apologies and thanks to fans".
