Belgium's David Goffin will contest Novak Djokovic's final round-robin match at the World Tour Finals on Thursday after Gael Monfils withdrew.

Monfils, who had been eliminated anyway, has struggled after hurting his ribs in Stockholm in October.
"I tried to make it, but I couldn't," said Monfils, who has lost to Dominic Thiem and Milos Raonic at the O2.
Djokovic, who is already into the semi-finals, can earn 200 ranking points by beating first alternate Goffin.
The Serb is attempting to win a fifth straight World Tour Finals - a result which would ensure he reclaims the world number one spot from Britain's Andy Murray.
Murray leapfrogged Djokovic to reach the top of the rankings for the first time in his career on 7 November.
World number 11 Goffin, 25, has lost all four of his previous meetings with Djokovic - most recently in the semi-finals of the Miami Masters in March.
