Nuclear bunker and boat cabin up for Shed of the Year award

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A nuclear bunker in Brechin and a fishing boat cabin in the Highlands are in the running for this year's coveted Shed of the Year award.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Jim Sherrit's restored three-man bunker is 20ft (6m) below ground and only accessible by hatch and ladder.
The Maggie Ewing - a renovated ex-boat wheelhouse - is owned by David Carter and made from one of the last boats ever commercially built in Caithness.
The entries are among a shortlist of 32 from around the UK.
Competition includes a recreation of the Millennium Falcon, a shed built on the back of an Austin J4 pick-up truck and a Wild West "saloon".
The shortlisted sheds will feature on Amazing Spaces Shed Of The Year, on Channel 4, and the public can vote until 8 June for the category winners.
