Margaret Rhodes said the monarch, who holidays at Sandringham in Norfolk, can imitate the distinctive local brogue "beautifully".
The Queen, who turns 90 this week, is still "full of laughter", Mrs Rhodes told BBC Radio 4.
She also has a sense of humour when things go pear-shaped, and enjoys telling amusing tales, her cousin said.
"She can tell very funny stories of things that have happened to her where things might have gone just a fraction wrong," Mrs Rhodes told the PM programme.
One such tale might include the time she met a shopper in Sandringham who did not recognise her and declared that she looked just like the Queen, prompting the monarch to remark: "How very reassuring".
Ms Rhodes said the Queen's vocal talents were not confined to the East of England, and years spent at Balmoral in Aberdeenshire meant she is also able to do an impressive Scottish accent.
