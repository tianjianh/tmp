Young's Seafood: 650 jobs to go as factories remain open

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Young's Seafood is to keep its Fraserburgh and Grantown on Spey facilities open after a review - but has said about 650 jobs will be lost.

Jobs at Young's were put under threat after the loss of a ??100m contract to supply salmon to supermarket chain Sainsbury's.
Young's said the new option would save 250 of the 900 threatened jobs.
The company stressed that the decision to cut 650 jobs had not been taken lightly.
The plant at Fraserburgh will now be a much-reduced operation focussing on hot and cold smoked ready-to-eat products.
Chief executive Pete Ward said: "We recognise the importance of the Fraserburgh and Spey Valley factories to their local communities and we are moving forward with a plan that will retain jobs at both of the sites."
He added that the company had agreed enhanced redundancy terms for those affected, and would help with trying to find alternative work.
The Scottish government said it would convene a taskforce to support the workers and communities affected by the job losses.
Business Minister Fergus Ewing said: "This is deeply disappointing, but not unexpected, news.
"Originally the company was proposing to cease operations in Fraserburgh and Grantown.
"Over the summer, the alternative plan was brought forward and discussed and we welcome the decision to retain the Grantown operation and keep staff at Fraserburgh.
"The impact of Young's decision on Fraserburgh and the whole of the north east will be significant and far reaching."
