A stained glass window has been installed at St Martin's Church in Bladon, Oxfordshire, where the wartime prime minister is buried.
It will be unveiled by the Duchess of Cornwall.
The Duchess will also open a memorial garden, and unveil a bust, at Churchill's ancestral home of Blenheim Palace.
The window, featuring imagery of a Spitfire, a gas mask and a cat, has been created to mark 50 years since Churchill's death.
Designed by Emma Blount, its main figures are St Martin and St Alban, but it includes images of Churchill touring a wartime dockyard, and on the banks of the Rhine.
It also includes his coat of arms, and along its outline, images which represent aspects of his life.
These include Sir Winston playing polo, the portcullis of the House of Commons, an evacuee, a tank, the V for Victory salute, painting brushes, and his profile with a cigar.
The garden at Blenheim was designed by landscape architect Kim Wilkie.
Located near the Temple of Diana, where Churchill proposed to his wife Clementine in 1908, the garden consists of a winding 90-metre path dotted with milestones, to commemorate the 90 years of his life.
