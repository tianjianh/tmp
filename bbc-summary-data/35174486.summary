The benchmark index opened 0.24% up at 6,255.85 on Friday. Trading ends early at 12:30 GMT for the Christmas break.
The FTSE 100 closed up 2.6% on Thursday, driven by mining shares which benefited from a rise in metals prices and the price of oil.
Anglo American and BHP Billiton gained another 1% in early trading.
Oil giants Royal Dutch Shell and BP both rose 1.1%.
Retailers were among the main casualties, with investors perhaps worried about reports that Christmas trading may not live up to expectations.
Kingfisher, Sainsbury's and Tesco were down about 0.5%.
Outside the top flight, stockbroker Panmure Gordon fell 1.5%. That followed a more than 17% tumble on Wednesday amid concerns about fee income from dealmaking.
