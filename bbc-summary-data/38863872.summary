[SN]TITLE[SN]
Leyton Orient 0-1 Morecambe

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A wonderful strike by Paul Mullin in the 73rd minute earned Morecambe a 1-0 win at relegation-threatened Leyton Orient.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Mullin scored his sixth goal of the season when he turned away from three defenders and unleashed an unstoppable left-footed shot from 20 yards into the top-right corner.
The win extended the Shrimpers' unbeaten run to five matches and left Orient without a point in 2017.
Gavin Massey produced a fine effort when striking the ball with the outside of his foot. It required a full-length save from Morecambe keeper Barry Roche to deny him and from the resulting corner Tom Parkes drove the ball wide from just 12 yards.
Massey also caused problems for the visitors when he delivered a telling cross form the right that went across the face of the goal with onrushing debutant Victor Adeboyejo just inches away from applying the final touch.
Morecambe did have the ball in the net on the half-four but Peter Murphy was adjudged to have kicked it out of the hands of Sam Sergeant who had saved a shot by Kevin Ellison.
Although Orient had dictated before the interval, the visitors stepped up their game in the second period.
Ellison squandered an excellent chance to put the Shrimpers in front when he was put through on 63 minutes with only Sargeant to beat but the 19-year-old shot-stopper produced an outstanding save.
Lee Molyneux and Aaron Wildig also went close before Mullin showed the way to goal with his sublime effort that alone deserved all three points.
