The hosts took the lead in the second half when debutant Nicky Deverdics' shot proved too hot to handle and Joe Healy slammed home.
However, John Rooney shrugged off his contract row to cross for Jordan White to level at the second attempt.
Dover remain fifth in the final play-off berth. Wrexham are up to 10th and are seven points off the top five.
Wrexham boss Dean Keates told BBC Radio Wales Sport:
"I think in the end we are happy with a point.
"That is as good as we have played this season.
"I am proud of the lads, they showed great character to get back into it and at the end, we were the team pushing to win the game."
