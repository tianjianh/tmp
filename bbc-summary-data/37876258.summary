Forty-five men who died in the worst offshore helicopter accident in Scotland's history have been remembered at a service marking the 30th anniversary of the tragedy.

A Chinook helicopter crashed just a minute's flying time away from Sumburgh in Shetland in 1986.
The service remembered all those who have died working in the UK's offshore industry.
It was held at the Kirk of St Nicholas in Aberdeen.
The service included an act of remembrance, where the names of those added to the book of remembrance were read out, followed by a piper's lament and a minute's silence.
Among the speakers were Rev Pauline Nixon, whose husband Neville Nixon died in the Sumburgh disaster.
Josh Watson, a five-year-old whose grandfather was killed in the Chinook crash, lit a candle.
Iain Stuart, 41, from Laurencekirk, who died in a helicopter crash off Norway in April, was among the others remembered.
The Rev Gordon Craig, the chaplain to the oil and gas industry who officiated at the service, said: "It is really important for families to realise their loved ones are still being remembered and respected by the industry.
"The service is an opportunity to commemorate all those no longer with us.
"Thirty years on from the Chinook crash may seem like a long time but the memories are still vivid for those who lost their loved ones suddenly and tragically. The pain may be more manageable but there will still be times when the loss is felt deeply."
