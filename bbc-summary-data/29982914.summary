The 84-year-old made his illness public at an event in Sydney to mark the start of Australia's summer season.
"I'm coping with it very well - the doctors are pleased," he told Australian broadcaster Channel Nine.
Benaud, who has commentated since he stopped playing in 1964, has not worked since crashing his car in October 2013.
He said he was receiving treatment for skin cancers on his forehead and the top of his head, and urged people to protect themselves from the sun.

"I recommend to everyone they wear protection on their heads. Eighty-four-year-olds don't seem to mend as well as they used to," he said.
"When I was a kid, we never ever wore a cap. I wish I had. You live and learn as you go along," he added.
He said he was still recovering from injuries - including two fractured vertebrae - sustained after crashing his vintage 1963 Sunbeam Alpine in Sydney a year ago.
But he confirmed he was returning to work with Channel Nine and would be commentating on Australia's fourth Test against India on 3 January.
Benaud made his broadcasting debut on BBC Radio in 1960 and moved across to BBC Television three years later, becoming a full-time cricket journalist and commentator when his playing career ended.
