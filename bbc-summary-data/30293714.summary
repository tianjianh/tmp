[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The death of a 15-year-old Swansea boy has been described as "totally tragic".

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
James Lock was discovered hanged in Hendrefoilan Woods near Olchfa Comprehensive School in April.
In a narrative verdict at Swansea Coroner's Court, acting coroner Colin Phillips said: "This is a totally tragic death of a very young man who had a lot to offer."
A 17-year-old girl was given a police caution for posting an "offensive" comment on Facebook after his death.
The inquest heard how the keen rugby player from Dunvant had developed an interest in thrash metal music and was never seen without his iPod before his death.
He had also started drawing imagery that his parents described as "dark" but Mr Phillips said that "merely reflects his music interests rather than anything else".
A statement from James's mother, Sarah Jones, said her son was "quick tempered and would sometimes act without thinking of the consequences of his actions".
No suicide note was found and toxicology tests showed he had not been drinking or taking drugs prior to his death.
Mr Phillips said he did not record a verdict of suicide because he was not convinced that James fully appreciated the finality of his actions.
