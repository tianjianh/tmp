[SN]TITLE[SN]
Thomas Valliday, convicted murderer, escapes during hospital visit

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Police are searching for a convicted murderer who escaped from prison staff on Friday afternoon.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Thomas Valliday is unlawfully at large from Maghaberry prison.
The 27-year-old escaped while at the Ulster hospital in Dundonald.
Police have issued a warning to the public not to approach Valliday as he is considered dangerous.
Valliday was told in March 2010 that he would serve at least 17 years of a life sentence for the murder of west Belfast man Frank 'Bap' McGreevy.
He attacked the 51-year-old former IRA prisoner in his flat in Ross Street in Belfast in March 2008.
Valliday, also from west Belfast, was high on a cocktail of drink and drugs when he battered Mr McGreevy with a variety of weapons, including a pick-axe handle.
Mr McGreevy died three days later.
Police are urging anyone who may see Valliday to call them.
