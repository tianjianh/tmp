Mark Stewart, Kian Emadi-Coffin, Andrew Tennant and Oliver Wood completed their 4,000m race 1.34 seconds ahead of France's team, who took silver.
Earlier, Emily Kay, Manon Lloyd, Emily Nelson and Eleanor Dickinson claimed gold ahead of Italy, finishing 1.89 seconds quicker over the same distance.
The two golds move Britain top of the medal table after four of 16 events.

Britain won team pursuit gold in the men's and women's events at the Rio Olympics this summer, too, but none of those eight medallists were racing in Glasgow.
Nelson told BBC Sport: "To come out and beat Italy, who won gold at the Europeans, is something special. We're all fighting for Tokyo [the 2022 Olympic Games]."
Wood added: "That was my first really big win in the team pursuit - it was brilliant. [Many of the Olympic athletes] have gone away for a bit of family time. The young guys have just stepped in and we're making the most of it."
