The Aston Villa left-back, 25, signed a season-long loan deal with the Owls after a loan spell at Bournemouth.
Bennett believes that he has a lot to offer Wednesday, who have won their last three consecutive league games.
"I like to get forward and be creative, and I think I can add something to that part of their game," he told BBC Radio Sheffield.
"I think Wednesday will be up there at the end of the season and that's exactly why I came here."
He played 42 games for Brighton last season but his time at Bournemouth was cut short by an Achilles injury.
Bennett has made 30 league appearances for Aston Villa and says he was encouraged to join Wednesday following a conversation with former Villa team-mate Barry Bannan.
"I spoke to (Wednesday midfielder) Barry and he said he is really enjoying it here," Bennett added.
"He said he loved it up there and he's been playing really well. There's no reason why I can't do the same."
