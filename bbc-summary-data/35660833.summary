A Leicester City fan has convinced his partner to name their unborn child after striker Jamie Vardy by launching an online petition.

Ashley Marriott, from Leicester, will give his daughter the middle name Vardy after he hit a target of 5,000 signatures.
He reached the total on Thursday after the story was originally featured in the Leicester Mercury.
The "massive" Foxes fan said he has had support from all over the world.

"Jokingly the other night she [Mr Marriott's partner Daisy] said to me, 'I've been following your campaign, it's not really got anywhere', and the day after...it went everywhere," Mr Marriott said.
"I'm happy and I think she's taken to it now - there's no way you can back out from it now."
Mr Marriott said he has been in awe of the Vardy's achievements this season - including scoring in 11 consecutive matches - as Leicester continue to exceed all expectations at the top of the Premier League.
The Foxes are two points clear with 12 games remaining, despite being bottom of the table at the same stage last season.
He said his girlfriend was initially not convinced by his idea and took a lot of persuading.
Mr Marriott added: "I kept saying about it and she thought I was joking, but I was serious. I wanted it to happen so I had to do something to show I was serious."
He started the petition last week and said she finally "gave in" after the target was broken.
One of the comments on the petition page is from a Jamie Vardy, but it is unclear if it is the Leicester City player or someone pretending to be him.
It said: "Follow your dream mate, support us all the way!! Thankful to you for being so loyal and a true fan to dedicate her middle name to me."
The baby is due to be born in June.
