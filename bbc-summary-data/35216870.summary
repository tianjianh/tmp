Officers were contacted at 10:30 local time (18:30 GMT) on Saturday about the alleged incident at the Palms Casino resort, according to Lt Jeff Goodwin.
A police statement said an altercation took place in a room when a woman went to take a picture of Brown and was struck by him before he took her phone.
His publicist Nicole Perna called the woman's charges "unequivocally untrue".
Police officers were unable to speak to Brown at his hotel room as he had left before they arrived.
They said a crime report has been taken, listing Brown for for misdemeanour theft and misdemeanour battery.
Ms Perna said the woman's allegations were "a complete fabrication".
Grammy winner Brown, whose hits include Run It! and Kiss Kiss, had performed on Friday at a Las Vegas nightclub where he appears regularly.
