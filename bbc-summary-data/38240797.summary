The 32-year-old defender, who played at the Olympics in 2012 and 2016, revealed he was not in the panel soon to be named by head coach Bobby Crutchley.
He has more than 200 caps, playing firstly for Ireland and then GB.
Lewers said his age was one reason given for his omission, as GB wanted to plan for the 2020 Olympics in Tokyo.
"I was a bit shocked when I was told," said Lewers.
"Overall, it is sad and disappointing. They cited my age and said they had to plan for Tokyo."
After the failure of Great Britain to make the quarter-finals in Rio this summer, Lewers voiced opinions on what went wrong and he feels that may also have counted against him.
Lewers played for Ireland until 2008 and then switched to GB, making his debut in 2011.
He competed in the 2012 London Olympics where Britain narrowly missed out on a medal, finishing fourth.
London-based Lewers competed for England at the 2014 Commonwealth Games in Glasgow where they won the bronze medal to add to other third place finishes in the 2011 European Championships and 2014 World League.
He was also the Player of the Tournament at the 2013 European Championships.
