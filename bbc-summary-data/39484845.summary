[SN]TITLE[SN]
Port Talbot nursery staff 'never cruel' to children

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A deputy manager at a Port Talbot nursery has told a court she never treated children poorly - or saw others behave that way.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Christina Pinchess, 31, and two former colleagues deny child cruelty offences at Bright Sparks nursery in Taibach before it closed.
A work placement student has told Swansea Crown Court she saw a child get "flung" by the wrist by a staff member.
But giving evidence, Ms Pinchess rejected the claims against her.
Asked directly by her defence barrister, Stephen Rees, whether she had ever been cruel to a child, she replied: "No."
She was also asked if she had fed a child in a manner contrary to her training and experience.
"No... never," she responded.
She also denied covering up the mouth of a child who was crying.
When asked whether she had fed a child while his arms were being held by another defendant, Shelbie Forgan, she replied: "No... not at all."
The prosecution say young children were force-fed and restrained as well as picked up by their wrists before being dropped to the floor.
But the jury heard Ms Pinchess told police it was "not in my nature" to hurt children.
Bright Sparks' former owner Katie Davies, 32, is also on trial as is 22-year-old staff member Ms Forgan, both of whom are from Port Talbot.
All three deny causing cruelty to a person under the age of 16.
The trial continues.
