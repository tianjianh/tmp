Super League side and Challenge Cup holders Hull FC have signed half-back Albert Kelly from city rivals Hull Kingston Rovers on a one-year deal.

The 25-year-old Australian moved to Yorkshire in 2015 after spells with NRL sides Cronulla and Gold Coast Titans.
Kelly was Rovers' player of the year in 2015, but could not help the Robins avoid relegation to the Championship via the Million Pound Game last season.
He becomes Hull FC's fourth signing of the close season.
"I think I might bring a bit more sting in attack and I think that's a bit of excitement for the fans as well," Kelly told the club website.
"It was pretty exciting seeing Hull go to Wembley and win the Challenge Cup. Some of my good mates were in there and to see them smiling and lifting the trophy is something I want to do as well."
Meanwhile, Australian outside back Steve Michaels, 29, has signed a new one-year deal with the club.
