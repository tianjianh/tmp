German police have searched 11 offices of carmaker Daimler as part of their investigation into possible fraudulent emissions data by employees.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A total of 23 prosecutors and 230 police officers took part in the search in the states of Baden-Wuerttemberg, Berlin, Lower Saxony and Saxony,
Daimler, which owns Mercedes-Benz, said it was co-operating with authorities.
It added "known and unknown employees" were being sought over suspicion of fraud and misleading advertising.
The case relates to the possible manipulation of diesel exhaust emissions in passenger cars.
It is possible that further civil and criminal investigations and enforcement actions will come into effect.
Earlier this year, fellow German carmaker Volkswagen pleaded guilty to three charges as part of an agreement with US regulators over its own diesel emissions case.
It has already had to set aside more than 22bn euros (Â£19bn, $24.7bn) for fines and compensation.
