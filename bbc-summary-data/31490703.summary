Oscar money facts you may not know: because it's expensive

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Every year, the buzz around the Oscars permeates the world of Hollywood and when you break it down, it's all about one thing really: $$$.

From nomination to the winning, getting a little golden man can be an expensive business for someone in Hollywood, whether you're an actor/actress, studio, PR or even the make-up artist.
Tinseltown spends big when it comes to this one little five hour ceremony.
The Academy Awards are tonight, so here are some facts to "wow" your friends.
According to The Hollywood Reporter, the PR companies who are employed to help spearhead the campaigns of getting the movies the top Oscars, stand to get paid a bonus in the tens of thousands if the film they've been marketing, wins.
There are a hell of a lot of parties connected to the Oscars. Like... a lot.
It's known as "campaigning" where studios basically get the stars in the films to be events with Academy voters to schmooze to help them win. Those parties come in at a cool $2m (£1.3m).
Nominees this year will get a non-Academy affiliated goodie bag, estimated to be worth around £81,000, according to Vanity Fair.
Skincare, accessories, a three night stay in Tuscany, and an Afterglow vibrator are a few of the things stars will get.
Ok, this one isn't really money related, but it is interesting.
Back in 2013, the LA Times conducted a survey of Academy voters. The Academy doesn't release demographic information about its members, so the LA Times used public information and private databases to confirm the race, gender and age of new members who'd joined that year.
The survey found 94% of them were all white, 76% are all men and the average age? 63 years old.
You know when you hear reporters shouting "who you wearing?" when celebrities walk a red carpet?
Maybe it's because on average it costs around £2,280 to prepare a Hollywood actress for the red carpet and that's just hair and make-up.
Imagine how much that jumps to when they get their dress, shoes and jewellery?
Winning a golden statue to display on the mantel or in your downstairs toilet is obviously lovely, but it also helps with the pay packet.
Because according to the Forbes magazine, you're winning if you're a man: by 81%.
Or in other words, after winning the best actor Oscar, a man can expect £2.34m salary increase, just for winning an Oscar.
For winning the best actress, its about £325,460.
Then of course there's the film itself.
After ploughing millions in marketing to get bums on seats at the cinema to watch the film, and then millions more on getting more attention of Academy voters, studios expect to make £8.27m more just because it got Oscar nominated.
But in saying all of that, winning a Golden Globe pays better: £9.24m on average.
