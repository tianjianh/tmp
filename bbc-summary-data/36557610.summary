A gunman killed 49 people in the early hours of Sunday morning at a gay nightclub in the city.
Aguilera said: "The horrific tragedy that occurred in Orlando continues to weigh heavily on my mind."
"I am left wondering how people filled with so much love could be taken by so much hate."
The singer's new single, Change, was released on Friday.
A statement from Aguilera's management confirmed 100% of proceeds from US download sales of the song will donated to the National Compassion Fund, which benefits the Orlando shooting victims and their families.
"Like so many, I want to help be part of the change this world needs to make it a beautiful, inclusive place where humanity can love each other freely and passionately," Aguilera said.
A host of stars have paid tribute to victims of the Orlando shootings in the past week.
Sir Paul McCartney appeared on stage with a rainbow flag - the symbol of the LGBT community - draped over his shoulders.
He also tweeted: "We stand together with Orlando."
In a message posted online, singer Ricky Martin wrote: "The tragedy that occurred in Orlando hurts me in so many ways.
"It hurts me as a man, as a human being, and as a gay person, because so many of the victims were brothers and sisters of the LGBT community."
Lin-Manuel Miranda, star of the Tony Award-winning Broadway show Hamilton, launched a range of merchandise to raise money for victims.
It was also announced that a group of Broadway stars will record a version of What the World Needs Now Is Love, which will also raise money for the cause.
