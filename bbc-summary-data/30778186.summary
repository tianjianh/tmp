It follows controversy over payouts such as £277,000 for Pembrokeshire chief executive Bryn Parry-Jones.
Redundancy payments will be capped at £90,000 for NHS and council staff, the Lib Dems said, if it came into power after the 2016 assembly election.
People on low and middle incomes would be exempt, following consultation on where the line should be drawn.
Local government spokesman Peter Black said the Lib Dems would end the "golden goodbyes" that had cost "hard-pressed taxpayers hundreds of millions of pounds".
"At a time when nurses, teachers and police have all either had their salaries frozen or they've seen a minimal pay-rise, it is simply not acceptable that their bosses are on the receiving end of six-figure redundancy payments," he said.
"For too long the Welsh Labour government has sat back and accepted these pay-outs; this complacency must end."
The Welsh government said it was not currently a devolved matter but it supported "consistency of treatment for public sector employees across the UK".
The Conservatives have pledged to cap public sector pay-offs at £95,000 if they win the 2015 general election.
Plaid Cymru's Welsh local government spokesperson Rhodri Glyn Thomas said: "The issue of payouts for fat cats needs to be dealt with but shouldn't distract from the real problem at the bottom of the workforce, where we need to give local authorities in particular the funding they need to meet the living wage."
