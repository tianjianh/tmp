[SN]TITLE[SN]
Fulham 1-0 Bolton Wanderers

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Bottom-of-the-table Bolton Wanderers finished a disastrous season without a single away league win as Fulham won to move up to 20th in the Championship.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Tom Cairney's curling second-half goal was enough to earn Fulham a third win from their final four home games.
The Cottagers had the better of the few chances, as Bolton slumped to their 26th league defeat of the season.
Slavisa Jokanovic's side almost added late goals but Bolton keeper Ben Amos denied Matt Smith and Ross McCormack.
Fulham have now not lost in their last 15 home league meetings with Wanderers.
With a final points tally of 30, Bolton finished with their lowest total for a season since they were relegated from the Premier League in 1995-96.
Fulham head coach Slavisa Jokanovic: "If you want to analyse today I believe it's not necessary, we played enough good football.
"I am happy for three points and we have had the opportunity to give something back to our supporters.
"Now it is over and it is time to start working for what is in front of us. We have ambition from all sides of the club, we have to have ambition for recruitment and we have to have a completely different target for next season."
Bolton interim manager Jimmy Phillips: "Ben Amos had a great game, and we needed him to have one.

"It was in possession, really, we didn't get any forward momentum which was disappointing on the day, because we certainly didn't set out to be particularly defensive.
"Amos made a series of great saves, and it took something special to beat him."
