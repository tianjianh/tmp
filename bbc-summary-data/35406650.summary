Will Atkinson's 25-yard shot put the visitors ahead, before Andy Mangan equalised for Shrewsbury from close range just after the break.
Southend's Michael Timlin was dismissed for a second yellow with 25 minutes remaining for a foul on Jack Grimmer.
But the 10 men won it when, from 12 yards, Hendrie smashed in on-loan Norwich debutant Jamar Loza's cross.
Southend move level on points with sixth-placed Millwall, while Shrewsbury remain a point clear of the relegation zone in 20th.
Town's seven straight home league game without a win, during which they have lost five times, came just three days after knocking Championship side Sheffield Wednesday out of the FA Cup at the Greenhous Meadow.
Shrewsbury Town manager Micky Mellon told BBC Radio Shropshire:
"It is probably the best we have been at home for a while. We played some good football, but we just didn't take our chances. We lacked the end product.
"I would have been disappointed with a point let alone a loss. Then we switched off in defence and, when you do that, you end up on the wrong end of the result.
"Apart from the mistake for their goal I can't really criticize the lads' performance. It is a sore one to take. It was a good performance but we got punished for mistakes."
