[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Airdrieonians have announced head coach Mark Wilson has left the Scottish League One club "by mutual consent".

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Wilson, 33, departs after a near-eight month spell in charge, having replaced acting head coach Kevin McBride.
Last season, Airdrie finished third in their division but were unsuccessful in the promotion play-offs.
"After his first taste of management, Mark has decided that he now wishes to expand his coaching horizons across the game," the club said on their website.
"Everybody at the club would like to thank Mark for his hard work and solid professionalism and we wish him well for the future."
After manager Eddie Wolecki Black suffered a stroke during a game in March 2015, Airdrie under-20s coach Kevin McBride stepped up to work at first team level until former Celtic player Wilson and new director of football Gordon Dalziel joined the club.
"Mark stepped in to the post at a time of great uncertainty at the club and, under difficult circumstances, he still managed to put together a challenge that successfully took the club to the play-offs and achieved the objective set for him."
