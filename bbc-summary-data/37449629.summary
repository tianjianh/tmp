Former Cameron aide gets top diplomatic job

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
David Cameron's former chief of staff has been named as the UK's new ambassador to France.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Ed Llewellyn served alongside Mr Cameron for a decade while he was opposition leader and prime minister.
He was among a host of former Downing Street aides controversially given peerages after Mr Cameron quit No 10.
He has now been given the coveted diplomatic posting in Paris, succeeding Sir Julian King who recently became the UK's EU Commissioner.
In the role, he will be responsible for political and diplomatic relations with France during a crucial period in the run-up to next year's presidential elections and negotiations over the UK's exit from the EU.
The appointment will be seen as controversial given Mr Llewellyn's friendship with Mr Cameron and the former prime minister's strong support for the UK remaining in the EU.
Before working for Mr Cameron, Mr Llewellyn served Lord Patten in his roles as Hong Kong Governor and EU Commissioner and also worked for former Lib Dem leader Lord Ashdown when he was High Representative for Bosnia and Herzegovina
Announcing the appointment, Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson said Mr Llewellyn was "hugely well qualified" for the role.
"He will help us make a great success of Brexit while ensuring that Britain is more engaged in the continent of Europe than ever," he said.
Mr Llewellyn was awarded a peerage in July but has yet to take up his seat in the House of Lords.
