A man who was fed up waiting for a taxi on a night out was among the people who phoned 999 inappropriately in the past year.

The Scottish Ambulance Service has released details of some of the calls they have received as they approach one of the busiest periods of the year.
One caller requested an ambulance for a choking dog, while another phoned with a sore finger after cutting their nail.
Someone also phoned 999 to ask for the number of NHS24.
The ambulance service has reminded people that inappropriate calls can potentially delay an ambulance response to a real emergency.
The service said it dealt with an increase of up to 30% of calls in the festive season.
Pauline Howie, chief executive of the Scottish Ambulance Service, said: "Our staff work tirelessly to respond to calls for help and deliver the most appropriate care, but the 999 service is for emergencies and we are asking the public to use it wisely so that we can continue to send ambulances quickly to those who need us most.
"At peak periods, like the festive season, every inappropriate call has the potential to put a life at risk and delay a response to a genuine emergency."
