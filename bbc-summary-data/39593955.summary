David Akers, 61, drove the girl to remote locations and assaulted her while he was deputy head of Budmouth School in Weymouth.
He was found guilty of three counts of indecent assault of a child under 16 and cleared of three others following a trial at Bournemouth Crown Court.
He was jailed for four years and put on the sex offenders' register for life.
Dorset Police said the offences came to light when the victim told her partner and friends in 2015.
In a police interview Akers, from Waddon in Weymouth, admitted knowing the victim as a former pupil, but denied having had any sexual contact with her.
Det Con Richard Bayley said: "David Akers was in a position of trust and abused that trust to engage in an inappropriate relationship with a pupil."
The school previously confirmed the defendant had not worked at the school since December 2015.
A spokesman for Budmouth College - its new name - said: "The college has assisted the police throughout the investigation and judicial process. We respect the verdict of the jury and now hope to move forwards, continuing to focus on our students, staff and wider community."
