The 51-year-old man, who is thought to be from the Aberdeen area, was on the Carn Mor Dearg Arete when he fell.
The ridge is often used by experienced walkers as a more challenging way of reaching the summit of Ben Nevis.
The alarm was raised by his two companions on Friday morning. His body was recovered by the Lochaber Mountain Rescue Team.
The man was airlifted to hospital in Fort William, where he has pronounced dead.
Mountain rescue team leader John Stevenson said conditions in the area were good at the time, and the walkers had been well-equipped for the mountains.
The man was the second to have died in the area this week.
The body of 60-year-old Ian Bell, from Hertfordshire, was found by the mountain rescue team on Carn Mor Dearg on Tuesday. He had been reported missing the previous day.
Earlier this week, the Lochaber team said it had been dealing with an "exceptional amount" of call-outs in recent months.
