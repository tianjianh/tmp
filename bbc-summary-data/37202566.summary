[SN]TITLE[SN]
Mansfield Town 0-0 Cambridge United

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
High-flying Mansfield were forced to settle for a drab 0-0 draw against bottom side Cambridge in difficult conditions at Field Mill.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The first half was a dull affair with neither side taking control in the wind and rain. Cambridge did have the ball in the net after only four minutes, but an offside flag was raised before Luke Berry headed home from six yards.
On 32 minutes it took a superb sliding tackle by Stags defender Mal Benning to stop Conor Newton in his tracks as he shaped to finish.
Mansfield's three best goal attempts all came from Mitch Rose. The midfielder volleyed over on 11 minutes, forced Will Norris to block his 20-yard snapshot on 24 minutes and saw Norris well-placed for his ambitious 35-yard dipper just before the break.
The second half was no better, though Newton wasted the chance of the game for Cambridge on 61 minutes. Unmarked, and only eight yards out, he turned Berry's cross wide of the far post.
