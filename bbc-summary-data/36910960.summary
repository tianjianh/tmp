The 31-year-old, who will wear number nine, has signed a two-year contract.
A tall and powerful target man with seven goals in 24 appearances for Spain, Llorente is a significant signing for the Premier League side.
"I am very happy to join Swansea," said Llorente, who scored seven goals in 36 games last season.
"I have scored goals in La Liga and Serie A, and now I want to score a lot of goals for the club in the Premier League."
He rose to prominence with Athletic Bilbao and joined Juventus in 2013, spending two years in Italy before moving back to Spain with Sevilla.
Llorente was part of the Spain squad that won the 2010 World Cup and Euro 2012.
He could make his first appearance for his new club as early as Saturday when the Swans host French side Stade Rennais in their final friendly before the Premier League season kicks off.
Llorente says he wants to follow the example of compatriot Michu, who scored 22 goals in 43 games in his first season at the Liberty Stadium, before he departed in November 2015.
"I want to score a lot of goals like Michu," said Llorente, adding: "He is a very good player and he did very well here."
Swansea City chairman Huw Jenkins has previously said the Welsh club want at least two new strikers after the summer departures of forwards Alberto Paloschi, Eder and Bafetimbi Gomis.
Francesco Guidolin's side are also interested in signing Atletico Madrid striker Borja Baston.
The club have enquired about Premier League champions Leicester City's Argentine striker Leonardo Ulloa too.
