Twenty-three elderly patients, some terminally ill, and nine staff were evacuated from St Michael's Hospice, in St Leonards, East Sussex on Saturday.
A woman, aged 78, died a short time after the fire, but it is not known whether her death was linked to it.
A 67-year-old man, who is known to the hospice, has been arrested on two counts of murder, Sussex Police said.
The man, from St Leonards, was arrested on Saturday on suspicion of arson with intent to endanger life.
The two further residents who died were a woman aged 62 and an 81-year-old man, who were being treated for smoke inhalation in hospital.
The fire broke out at about 00:40 BST and is believed to have started in a dormitory.
Firefighters from Bexhill, Battle, Burwash, Rye and Pevensey tackled the fire, which was declared a major incident.
Det Ch Insp Mark Preston, of the Surrey and Sussex Major Crime Team, said: "This is an extremely difficult time for the residents and staff of St Michael's Hospice and for the families of the residents who have sadly passed away."
