[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Fife, 25, won the last of his six caps at the end of the 2015 Six Nations but has largely figured for the Scotland Sevens side this year.
Toolis ends his partnership with twin brother Ben to return to Australia.
Backs Jack Cuthbert, Otulea Katoa, Nick McLennan and Jade Te Rure, plus prop Grant Shiells, are also moving on.
They join Matt Scott, Sam Beard, Mike Coman and John Andress, whose departures had already been announced, in leaving the capital club.
Head coach Alan Solomons said: "Everyone associated with the club, on and off the field, would like to wish all the players the very best for the future and thank them for their loyalty and commitment to the black and red over the years."
Edinburgh play Cardiff Blues at Murrayfield on Saturday in their final Pro 12 game of the season, needing a bonus-point win and other results to go their way to secure a top-six finish.
