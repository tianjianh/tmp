Highways England said the porcine interloper was spotted on the M62 between junctions 28 and 29, south of Leeds, at about 19:00 BST.
Traffic was held in both directions for more than an hour while the animal was recovered near Tingley.
The West Yorkshire Police Dogs unit aided in the capture of the pig. The motorway was reopened at about 20:30.
A Highways England spokesman said the road was closed at about 19:20 causing a 3.5 mile (5.6km) queue eastbound and a 1.8 mile (3km) tailback westbound.
West Yorkshire Police Road Policing Unit said the seven week-old piglet had escaped from a moving vehicle.
The force tweeted later to say the animal had been reunited with its owner.
