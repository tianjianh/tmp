[SN]TITLE[SN]
King's Lynn paper mill applies to build new electricity plant

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A paper manufacturer has applied to build a new plant to generate electricity and steam for its mill in West Norfolk.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Specialist newsprint manufacturer Palm Paper has submitted the planning application in a bid to cut its reliance on imported energy.
Due to its size, the application will be decided by the secretary of state instead of West Norfolk Borough Council.
The plan includes a gas-fired turbine.
Palm Paper's King's Lynn mill began production in August 2009 and in January this year produced its second millionth tonne of newsprint paper.
The company said generating its own electricity and steam would help reduce its carbon footprint.
The proposed new plant would replace existing boilers.
No concerns have been raised about air quality issues but an environmental management plan is proposed.
It would prevent construction work generating dust and emissions, which would constitute a risk to health or nuisance to local people or industry.
