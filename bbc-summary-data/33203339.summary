The 19-year-old was released by the Toffees earlier this month and the deal includes the option of a third year.
Green, who spent the final two months of last season on loan at Tranmere, moved to Goodison Park from Bradford aged 15 for a reported fee of Â£2m.
"Joe Royle at Everton pushed me towards Oldham because of his relationship with the club," said Green.
He is new Oldham boss Darren Kelly's second signing of the summer after Lee Croft.
"The gaffer has got a good footballing philosophy and he conducts himself very well, so I can't wait to work under him," Green added.
