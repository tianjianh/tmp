If each great city takes in a terror attack in its own way, in Barcelona they write on the trees.
Along Las Ramblas, on trees overlooking spots where the van ran people down, the beautiful patchwork of the bark teems with words and symbols.
"The plane trees of Barcelona witnessed the massacre," reads one message, written in Catalan. "They are still standing."
