Luis Suarez: Striker is as prolific as Harry Kane and Jamie Vardy put together

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Luis Suarez had one of the best nights of his career on Wednesday in what is set to be his most prolific season yet.

The Uruguyan scored four times and provided three assists as Barcelona revitalised their La Liga title push by thumping Deportivo La Coruna 8-0.
His 30th league goal of the campaign took his overall tally to 49 - matching his best in all competitions for a season, achieved with Ajax in 2009-10.
So how does the former Liverpool forward compare with England's finest?
Suarez has 49 goals this season - the same as Harry Kane and Jamie Vardy combined - but has some way to go to beat Messi's record of 73 set in 2011-12.
