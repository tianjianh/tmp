A third of online retailers apply delivery restrictions to NI says Consumer Council

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A third of online retailers apply delivery restrictions to Northern Ireland, according to the Consumer Council.

The consumer group made its findings to the Assembly's enterprise committee.
It said the restrictions could include higher charges, longer delivery times and refusal to deliver to NI.
The Consumer Council said while the level of exclusion was similar to other UK peripheral areas, it was 10 times higher than any other region in the UK.
Speaking about the research Kellin McCloskey, head of postal services at the Consumer Council, said: "Online shopping is becoming increasing popular, with over a third of NI consumers shopping online at least once a month.
"However, delivery restrictions can exclude some potential online shoppers from this increasingly important market, with NI consumers impacted particularly heavily.
"With only half of online retailers offering the same delivery service across the UK, regardless of location, many NI consumers can find themselves out of pocket, paying more for the delivery of their purchases.
"In instances where free and standard delivery were withdrawn for Northern Ireland addresses consumers could end up paying on average Â£10.00 for 'free' delivery or an additional Â£2.71 for 'standard' delivery."
Ms McCloskey said cost was not the "only factor" and said one in five retailers indicated that delivery times would vary and almost a fifth of retailers withdrew some of the delivery options available.
"The Consumer Council plans to work in partnership with politicians, eRetailers and other UK consumer organisations, to help raise awareness of these issues and seek solutions to ensure these they are addressed," she said.
Chairperson of the committee for enterprise, trade & investment, Patsy McGlone, said, "The committee considers it grossly unfair to local consumers that over a third of online retailers either do not deliver to Northern Ireland addresses or impose restrictions on what they will deliver here.
It is of particular concern that this is happening within a single EU member state at a time when the EU Commission has plans in place for a digital single market and growth in e-commerce across all member states."
Mr McGlone said the committee would "welcome the opportunity" to work with the Scottish Parliament or any of the devolved institutions to help resolve this problem for the benefit of all consumers.
