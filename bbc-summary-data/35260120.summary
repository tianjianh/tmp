Conor McKee, 31, was found dead in a house in Glenpark Street on Thursday.
Police said the men, aged 37 and 44, were arrested in Antrim and Belfast on Friday evening.
They were released on police bail on Saturday.
The investigation is ongoing.
Mr McKee was on bail for drugs offences at the time of his murder.
His body was discovered in an upstairs bedroom of the Glenpark Street house by his mother, at 22:30 GMT.
Police have said they cannot confirm how the father-of-two died. A post-mortem examination is yet to take place.
Detectives are appealing for anyone who saw a man near the house after 18:00 GMT on Thursday to get in contact.
They are also hoping to hear from a person who contacted police early on Thursday.
No-one else was in the house at the time Mr McKee was killed.
Earlier, Det Ch Insp Justyn Galloway said police were following a number of lines of enquiry and were keeping an open mind over the motive.
"This is a devastating tragedy for the McKee family and a terrible shock for the local community," he said.
" I am appealing for anyone who was in the area of Glenpark Street around 6.15pm last night who saw or heard anything unusual or suspicious to contact police," he said.
"I am particularly keen to talk to anyone who saw a man outside the McKee house, which is number five, at around 6.15pm.
"Secondly, I am making a specific appeal to the person who rang police in the early hours of this morning with information about the murder to call back. We really need to talk to that person.
"Thirdly, I would appeal to those people who knew Conor, who were his friends, to engage with police to help us build a picture of his life, his activities and his movements. The more information we have, the greater the likelihood is that we will bring his killer or killers to justice."
