[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Glasgow moved into the top four of the Pro12 with a hard-earned bonus-point victory over Zebre in Parma.

Tries from wing Sean Lamont and hooker Fraser Brown helped the  Warriors lead 18-11 at half-time, Oliviero Fabiani replying for the hosts.
Further scores from Lamont and replacement Leonardo Sarto, against his old club, extended the lead to 30-11.
But tries from Giovanbattista Venditti and Andries van Schalkwyk left Glasgow defending before Rory Clegg's penalty.
The fly-half's fifth successful kick from seven attempts with two minutes left pushed the visitors eight points clear, but Carlo Canna landed his third penalty with the last kick of the game to give the hosts a losing bonus point.
With four Scotland centres - Alex Dunbar, Mark Bennett, Peter Horne and Richie Vernon - on the Warriors' injured list, Nick Grigg took full advantage of a rare start and had a hand in three of the visitors' four tries.
Lamont touched down the opener from close range after Lee Jones was held up, and two Clegg penalties gave a Glasgow an 11-6 lead before Fabiani's try levelled the scores.
But Grigg took centre stage before the interval, bursting through the Zebre defence before offloading to Sarto, who was tackled just short.
The 24-year-old's best moment came two minutes from half-time when he picked the ball up on the Warriors' 22 and beat several would-be tacklers on a 90m run before releasing Brown for the second try.
Grigg darted through another gap before offloading to Lamont for his second early in the second half, and then released Sarto for a score on his old stomping ground.
Flanker Matt Fagerson - a late call-up to the starting XV after Corey Flynn was ruled out and Brown reverted to hooker - was earlier sin-binned for a dust-up with Zebre's Johan Meyer, who also saw yellow for the same incident after 32 minutes.
Glasgow took full advantage of Giulio Bisegni's yellow card early on the resumption, scoring two tries in his absence.
But a second Glasgow sin-bin for Rob Harley, when the lock was penalised for pulling down a maul 14 minutes from time, saw the visitors concede a third try and forced to defend manfully in his absence, before eventually eeing the game out.
Glasgow head coach Gregor Townsend:
"Zebre played well, they wanted to move the ball. It was a good win for us.  It was far from perfect but we're happy with the bonus-point win.
"We didn't see much ball in the second half. The game was a bit disjointed but in general with the ball we looked pretty good.
"Zebre could have gone and won that. We had to defend well and look after the ball."
