South Yorkshire Police hopes to build the 50-cell suite in Shepcote Lane, near to Meadowhall shopping centre.
It will replace suites in Ecclesfield, Sheffield and Rotherham, saving more than £1m a year said the police.
Ch Supt Rob Odell said it was hoped the new suite would be completed by the summer of 2016.
He said: "We anticipate that replacing three existing properties within Rotherham and Sheffield with one purpose-built facility will deliver annual savings of approximately £1.2m.
"The majority of this will come from a reduction in staffing, but there will be other revenue savings and energy efficiencies too.
"We are consulting regularly with the staff affected, who are mainly custody sergeants and detention officers, and we hope to achieve the savings through natural wastage."
A public consultation on the plans has begun.
