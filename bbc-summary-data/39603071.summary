Hibernian: Boss Neil Lennon free to be in dugout for Scottish cup semi-final

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Hibernian manager Neil Lennon will be in the dugout for his side's Scottish Cup semi-final with Aberdeen after his disciplinary hearing was postponed.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Lennon will face charges of adopting an aggressive attitude towards Morton boss Jim Duffy, Kudus Oyenuga and match officials in the 0-0 draw last month.
However, due to the non-availability of Hibernian's solicitor, the hearing was moved to 25 April.
That frees Lennon for the Hampden clash on Saturday 22 April.
A challenge from Morton's Oyenuga on Hibs' Darren McGregor sparked angry scenes in the Scottish Championship clash.
Duffy also faces a charge by Scottish FA compliance officer Tony McGlennan of misconduct for entering the Hibs technical area and adopting an aggressive attitude to Lennon.
Morton's hearing will go ahead on 20 April as planned.
