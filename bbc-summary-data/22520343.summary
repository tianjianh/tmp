Serco's custodial services director Wyn Jones said: "These are early days at the prison, and we accept completely the report's recommendations for future improvements.
"Among many areas of good practice across the prison identified by the report, we are especially pleased that it commended the extent to which prisoners feel safe in HMP Thameside."
"Much remains to be done, but this is a very positive start."
HMP Thameside is a category B establishment run by Serco Home Affairs and can currently hold 900 convicted and remand male prisoners.
It was opened along with G4S-run HMP Oakwood near Wolverhampton last year, creating about 2,500 prison places in total.
