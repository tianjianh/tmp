Welsh devolution: Deal was 'rushed' and 'incoherent' says Jones

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A new devolution package for Wales was prepared in a "rushed, incoherent and unsatisfactory" way, First Minister Carwyn Jones has told AMs.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Mr Jones said the deal, announced by UK ministers on Friday, was "no more than a staging post" to a better system.
The prime minister has argued the plan removes the "remaining barriers" to a referendum on tax powers.
But, on Tuesday, Mr Jones said the proposals were a "missed opportunity" on issues such as funding.
He has already rejected David Cameron's referendum call, saying a minimum funding offer for the Welsh government was merely a "vague promise".
