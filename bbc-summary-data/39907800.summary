West Midlands Police said seven of them were charged with pitch invasion, after Friday's game at The Hawthorns.
They are due to appear before Dudley Magistrates' Court later this month.
A 35-year-old man, from Solihull, was arrested on suspicion of a public order offence and a man from Suffolk, 32, was detained over suspected criminal damage and assault. Both have been bailed.
Chelsea were crowned Premier League champions as Michy Batshuayi's late goal gave them the victory they required to secure the title.
