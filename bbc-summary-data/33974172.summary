Writing in the Belfast Telegraph, Mr Burnham said he would "seek the views of the Irish Labour Party and others".
He added he wanted the "people of Northern Ireland to make their voices heard".
Boyd Black, the Labour party NI secretary, welcomed Mr Burnham's call.
Mr Black said the party has about 850 members plus many additional registered voters.
He has openly backed Mr Burnham in the campaign and said he believes his promises of a review are genuine "as he has always been consistent".
"I welcome his support for our campaign to run candidates here. His promotion of us standing has definitely improved our membership numbers," he said.
My Burnham tells the newspaper: "I am proud of my family roots in the north of Ireland and, growing up in Liverpool, the strong connection between the city and Ireland was ever present."
"I want the people of Northern Ireland to make their voices heard in the Labour Party and if I am elected leader, I'll ensure that the party is listening."
Jeremy Corbyn, the bookmakers' favourite in the leadership race, told the West Belfast Festival he would not support the party organising in Northern Ireland.
Mr Burnham is standing along with Yvette Cooper, Jeremy Corbyn and Liz Kendall.
Ballot papers were sent out on 14 August, with the result being announced on 12 September.
