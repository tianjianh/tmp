College fraud claim: Minister defends regulation

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The education minister has defended regulation of colleges after payments to a Cardiff campus and its students were suspended over fraud allegations.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
It follows a BBC Wales Week in Week Out investigation focusing on the West London Vocational Training College.
Huw Lewis told AMs checks and balances were in place but no regulation system could be "100% proof" against fraud.
The college said all of its students were genuine, as far as it was concerned.
The Cardiff branch runs various IT and business courses and has been designated as suitable to offer HND business courses, which attract tuition fees of Â£6,000 per student, funded by the Welsh government.
Students on those courses can also apply for Student Finance Wales loans and grants.
Week In Week Out has been investigating offers made by a local agent recruiting for the college.
Some students have been told by him they can use faked documents to access those loans and grants and they do not have to attend regularly to get the cash.
Mr Lewis announced on Friday that payments to the college and its Cardiff students were being suspended amid concerns over "unusual student recruitment trends".
Questioned about the matter in the Senedd on Tuesday, he told AMs: "There would be no system of regulation, or it would be difficult to contrive a system of regulation, that could be 100% proof against any planned or deliberate fraud."
Changes to the way such colleges are regulated were coming into force in January, he said.
"It would be difficult to see that this particular problem could have spread much wider; this is the only English-based private provider currently operating in Wales," Mr Lewis added.
It was for the BBC to make allegations and pass any findings to the police "as they should", he said.
Week In Week Out is on BBC One Wales at 22:40 GMT on Tuesday, 1 December
