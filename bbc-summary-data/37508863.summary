The Wigan player's partner gave birth 10 days ago, and Northern Ireland manager Michael O'Neill said Grigg "didn't feel being here was right".
"Will asked to not be in the squad due to a family situation, which I'm not going to go into," he added.
Defender Ryan McGivern and midfielder Matthew Lund are included.
Grigg, 25, missed the opening qualifier against the Czech Republic as his partner was expecting to give birth at the time.
"It's a blow for Will - he's been on the scoresheet and I had a good chat with him," added O'Neill at Wednesday's squad announcement.
Uncapped Rochdale midfielder Lund and Shrewsbury Town defender McGivern were late call-ups to the squad for the scoreless draw in Prague because of injuries, and they have another chance to impress O'Neill.

Hartlepool keeper Trevor Carson and Burton Albion defender Tom Flanagan are the other uncapped players in the 24-man squad.

Goalkeepers: Michael McGovern (Norwich), Alan Mannus (St Johnstone), Trevor Carson (Hartlepool)
