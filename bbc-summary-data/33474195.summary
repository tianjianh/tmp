Netherlands international Wijnaldum becomes the first arrival under head coach Steve McClaren.
The fee for the 24-year-old is the biggest single amount paid for a player during the eight-year reign of Newcastle owner Mike Ashley.
Rotterdam-born Wijnaldum, who has been at PSV since 2011, has signed a five-year contract at St James' Park.
He has been capped 13 times by the Netherlands and scored his country's third goal in their 3-0 win over Brazil to finish third at the 2014 World Cup finals.
"I'm delighted to be a Newcastle United player," Wijnaldum said.
"I felt the time was right for me to move and the club have shown they really want me.
"There are a few players here who are from Holland - I know them well and they will help me feel at home at Newcastle. I cannot wait to get started."
Wijnaldum is set to link up with McClaren's squad for the three-game tour of the United States, which kicks-off against Mexican side Club Atlas in Wisconsin on 14 July.
McClaren said: "The signing is a real statement for the club.
"It is a big transfer for a very good player and I am delighted to have Gini here. He is the right age and the right fit for Newcastle."
