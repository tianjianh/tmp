The 24-year-old former Bristol City trainee, who only re-joined Torquay on a short-term contract in January, has signed a one-year deal with Gateshead.
He made 49 league starts over two separate spells with the Gulls, either side of a four-month spell at Dover.
"I'm happy to be moving north. I wanted to move on and enjoy my football again," Ajala told the club website.
