[SN]TITLE[SN]
Two Simply Red band members resolve hunting rights dispute

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A dispute between two members of Simply Red and a neighbour over hunting rights at an estate that the band members own in County Donegal has been settled.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Letterkenny Circuit Court was told on Monday that the dispute between Mick Hucknall and Chris De Margary of Simply Red, and John Wilde had been resolved.
The terms of the agreement were confidential.
Mr Hucknall and Mr De Margary bought Glenmore Lodge near Ballybofey in 2005 for an estimated 1.3m euros ( Â£1.09m).
They have since run the Glenmore Rivers Sporting Estate there.
However, in December 2009, the Simply Red members went to court claiming that a neighbour, Mr Wilde of Cloghan Lodge, had been interfering with the sporting rights to lands surrounding their lodge.
Mr Wilde said the previous owners of Glenmore transferred those rights to his father.
However, Mr Hucknall and Mr De Margary said they bought all the sporting rights when they purchased Glenmore Lodge from Thomas Mackie and alleged Mr Wilde had been interfering with and had laid claim to those rights since that time.
A full hearing of the case had been due to begin at Letterkenny Circuit Court on Monday, but after a number of hours of talks, legal representatives told Judge John O'Hagan that agreement had been reached.
Judge O'Hagan congratulated both parties on coming to an agreement and said it was the sensible thing to do.
Mr Hucknall and Mr De Margary were not in court.
