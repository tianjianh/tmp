Stevenage 1-2 Carlisle United

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Danny Grainger's second-half penalty helped Carlisle to a fifth consecutive win as they triumphed 2-1 at Stevenage.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Cumbrians, who are yet to taste defeat in 14 League Two games this term, led through Jason Kennedy's bundled finish and although Matt Godden's spot-kick levelled proceedings, Grainger kept his cool from 12 yards to win it.
Carlisle started brightly and Charlie Wyke almost broke the deadlock after five minutes as he shot just over from a Nicky Adams cross.
Kennedy's sixth of the season gave the visitors the lead from close range in the 16th minute following a brilliant Jamie Jones save from another Wyke effort.
Stevenage equalised just before half-time after Tom Miller was penalised for a shirt pull on Charlie Lee and Godden smashed home the resulting penalty.
Referee Nicholas Kinseley awarded a second penalty in the 57th minute when Stevenage captain Ronnie Henry pushed Wyke in the area, and Grainger duly put the Cumbrians back in front.
Boro, searching for only a second league win in their last six games, could have equalised but Jack King failed to convert from six yards.
