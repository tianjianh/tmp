US election 2016: Trump team tries to ease global concern

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Donald Trump's campaign team has sought to allay negative views expressed overseas towards its candidate, a day before the US goes to the polls.

Campaign manager Kellyanne Conway told the BBC such antipathy "doesn't reflect why Donald Trump is running and who he would be on the global stage".
She also attacked Hillary Clinton's "unremarkable to chequered" record as secretary of state.
Both candidates are undertaking a blitz of campaigning in key states on Monday.
The latest national poll, conducted by YouGov for The Economist, gave Mrs Clinton a four-point lead.

Mr Trump has faced a barrage of criticism from some world figures during campaigning. French President Francois Hollande said the businessman made people "want to retch". The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights described him as a danger internationally.
Speaking to the BBC's Katty Kay, Ms Conway said negative attitudes overseas do "bother me" but defended Mr Trump's "America First" stance.
Mr Trump "does say America First and he means it", she said, spelling out the reasons - stopping the loss of American jobs overseas, making sure all partners, including Nato, pay their fair share and renegotiating trade deals that are bad for the US.

Ms Conway also responded to a jibe from President Barack Obama that Mr Trump could not be trusted with US nuclear codes.
The president, during a rally in Florida on Sunday, said that if Mr Trump could not be trusted with a Twitter account, he should not be in charge of US nuclear weapons.
He was referring to a New York Times report that Mr Trump's team had taken control of his Twitter account from him.
But Ms Conway denied the Times report and said Mr Trump could be trusted with the nuclear weapons.
She said that Mrs Clinton had herself "not proved to be qualified with nuclear codes" citing her use of a private email server for classified information when she was secretary of state from 2009 to 2013 in the Obama administration.
Ms Conway condemned Mrs Clinton for allegedly allowing her maid to print off classified documents.
On Sunday, the FBI's director said a fresh inquiry into the Democratic candidate's communications had found nothing to change the bureau's conclusion this summer that she should not face criminal charges.
Pointing to what she said was a series of foreign policy errors by Mrs Clinton, Ms Conway said: "The Russian reset was a joke, she owns the fake 'red-line' in Syria, she owns the lack of progress in North Africa and she certainly owns Benghazi."
Asked why Mr Trump had been referring to Brexit in recent times, she said he was talking about how the UK's Remain camp had seemed "pretty robust" in the final days before the referendum, but that the Leave team were able to turn out their supporters.
She said: "But I told him just yesterday you should stop referring to Brexit, because it's actually the Trump effect, the fact that you have so motivated new voters and lapsed voters."
A new poll organised by the global political movement, the Good Country, asking 100,000 people from 130 countries who they would vote for, saw Mrs Clinton secure 52%, with Green Party candidate Jill Stein on 19%, ahead of Donald Trump on 14% and Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson on 7%, with 8% abstaining.
The FBI ruling on the emails has cast a long shadow over the final full day of campaigning.
The Clinton campaign said it was "glad" the lingering issue had been resolved. Donald Trump accused the FBI of impropriety. Both sides accused the FBI of bungling the case.
Mrs Clinton will not be addressing the emails issue on Monday, her team said, but instead pitching herself as the candidate of "healing and reconciliation".
As she boarded her plane ahead of her first rally on Monday, she said: "I have some work to bring the country together."

Mrs Clinton then told supporters in Pittsburgh they faced a choice "between division and unity, between steady leadership and a loose cannon".
In Michigan, she attacked her rival for trumpeting American goods while he bought "cheap Chinese steel and aluminium".
"He made a lot of money off small businessmen by stiffing them by not paying his bills. Look at his record, don't just listen to his rhetoric," she said.
Mrs Clinton will go on to Philadelphia where she will be joined by President Barack Obama, First Lady Michelle Obama, husband Bill Clinton, and Bruce Springsteen.
The Democratic candidate will end her White House campaign with a midnight "get out the vote rally" in North Carolina.
Her daughter, Chelsea, wearing a "Make Herstory" T-shirt, appeared with Mr Obama early on Monday in Ann Arbor, Michigan.
The president launched an excoriating attack on Mr Trump, saying: "It's bad being arrogant when you know what you're talking about, but it's really bad being arrogant when you don't know what you're talking about."

Mr Trump began in Florida, then headed to North Carolina. He will move on to Philadelphia before ending with a rally in Grand Rapids, Michigan.
In Sarasota, Florida, he again railed against establishment politicians, leading the crowd in a chant of "Drain the Swamp!" and saying: "We're tired of being led by stupid people."
In Raleigh, North Carolina, he told the crowd: "We've got to go out and vote and win. You have one magnificent chance to beat the corrupt system you are witnessing today. Do not let this opportunity slip away."
Mr Trump will not let up on polling day, visiting Pennsylvania, Michigan, Ohio, North Carolina and New Hampshire after voting in New York.
He must win a high number of about a dozen battleground states to secure the presidency.
