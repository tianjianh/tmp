Sebastian Coe prioritises new anti-doping body in IAAF plan

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Sebastian Coe has pledged to set up athletics' own anti-doping body within 100 days if elected president of the sport's governing body, the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF).

Coe is running against former Olympic pole-vault champion Sergey Bubka.
The vote takes place on 19 August.
"My 100-day plan seeks to put in place important changes that will secure a brighter future for athletics globally," Coe said.
He added: "I am convinced that athletics can reclaim a new golden era, but to deliver this ambition I believe that we must have the right IAAF structures and resources in place, including a fully independent anti-doping agency for international level athletics."
Coe had previously cited the creation of athletics' own anti-doping body when launching his election manifesto in December.
But the pledge to make it a priority was one of eight unveiled by London 2012 Olympics chief Coe, also including the formation of a group to examine the athletics calendar and the creation of a department to advise on engagement with young people.
"We must also look creatively at the global athletics calendar, the way we present our sport and engage effectively with young people," the double Olympic gold-medallist added.
