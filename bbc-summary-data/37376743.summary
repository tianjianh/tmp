The 25-year-old has scored one goal in five appearances for the Championship club this season.
"He had a little problem and it was determined he would have to have an operation on his meniscus," Albion boss Chris Hughton told BBC Sussex.
"It is a big blow as he had been really good in training and was excellent in the two cup games."
