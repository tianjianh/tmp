The RSPB said the Â£200,000 project at Langford Lowfields, near Newark, will be home for rare wetland birds like the bittern and marsh harrier.
More than 300,000 tonnes of earth is being removed at Langford Quarry and shaped into islands and pools.
An RSPB spokesperson described the landscaping project as "breathtaking".
Site partner Tarmac Ltd, which owns the quarry, is working on the restoration as well as extracting gravel, which they have been doing for 20 years.
The new wetland area in construction is 50 hectares, roughly the size of 50 football pitches.
The nature reserve is 175 hectares of which 100 hectares will be dedicated solely to reedbeds.
Michael Copleston, RSPB Langford Lowfields site manager, said: "The major landscaping is a breathtaking change to the reserve.
"The last few years of hard work is already paying off with critically rare species making Langford Lowfields home."
New reed pools, channels and islands have been designed at the right depth and height for birds, animals and insects to feed and breed.
Work started at the quarry site about 10 years ago when volunteers planted the reserve's first reeds.
The bittern, one of the most threatened bird species in the UK, visited the site for the first time two years ago.
Marsh harriers and avocets have both successfully raised fledglings over the last two years, said the RSPB.
Langford Lowfields is already home to badgers, brown hares, wintering whooper swans, kingfishers and cuckoos.
The funding has come from the SITA Trust, Biffaward and Tarmac Ltd.
