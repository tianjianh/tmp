Protection for a sunken ship linked to the American Civil War

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The wreck of a Clyde-built paddle steamer bought by Confederate agents during the American Civil War has been designated as a Marine Protection Area (MPA), the Environment Secretary said.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The wreck of Iona I has been described as being in good condition - but "deteriorating".
The steamer sank in the Clyde in 1862.
The site is one of two new MPAs in Scotland to be announced - the other is at Fair Isle, off Shetland.
The Scottish government has designated the site of the Iona I shipwreck as a Historic Marine Protected Area (HMPA) to preserve it as a historic asset of national importance.
The Iona I operated on a Glasgow to the Highlands passenger route before it was purchased for use in delivering supplies to blockaded American ports.
But it sank in the Clyde near Gourock following a collision with another ship in 1862, so never reached the war.
It is hoped that preserving Iona I, one of only a few surviving paddle steamer wrecks, will increase the understanding of Scotland's role in the American Civil War.
The Scottish government hopes that creating an MPA at Fair Isle, involving a community-led approach to sustaining the marine environment, will increase recreation, tourism, research and education.
The Fair Isle MPA will also help local communities to protect seabirds observed in the area - including the Atlantic puffin, a threatened species.
On its website, The National Trust for Scotland said Fair Isle is "internationally renowned" for its seabird colony - which they said is the second largest in the UK.
Environment Secretary Roseanna Cunningham said: "It is our duty to protect these rich areas and historical sites while ensuring they benefit local communities.
"These MPAs will help protect and enhance our marine environment so it remains a prized asset for future generations."
The announcement was made at the Marine Conservation Society annual conference in Edinburgh.
The wider MPA network of all protected areas covers approximately 20% of our seas.
There are currently 30 nature conservation MPAs and 7 Historic MPAs in Scottish waters.
