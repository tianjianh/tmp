Wigan winning the Grand Final this season would surpass the league and cup double won in 2013, according to head coach Shaun Wane.

The Warriors face Hull FC on Friday in the Super League play-off semi-final for a place at Old Trafford.
They will be without 15 of their first-team squad because of injury and suspension, including captain Sean O'Loughlin and full-back Sam Tomkins.
"If we get another injury then we're in trouble," Wane told BBC Sport.
"We've got real problems, but if we get the victory it will make it all the more sweeter - it will be one of my best achievements if we get that."
Asked if winning Super League this year would top the double win three years ago, Wane responded: "Absolutely, no questioning that. This will be unbelievable if we got this one.
"There is a lot of work to do yet as Hull are hurting over their form since Wembley and they'll be coming for a big performance.
"We need to meet fire with fire and make sure it is a proper semi-final and we'll be well prepared for it."
