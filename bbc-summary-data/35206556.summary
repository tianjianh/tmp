A total of 22 households had to be evacuated from Crossway Point in King's Road after a burst water main left many flats "uninhabitable".
Now 18 of the families have been able to return, according to the housing association that manages the building.
Catalyst Housing said it was "very sorry for all the distress that this flood has caused" to residents.
Spokesman Neil Cross added four households currently remain in temporary accommodation.
He said: "Our hearts go out to all those who have been affected by the flood at Crossway Point - at what should have been a happy time of year.
"Some of the homes are still very wet, but we are continuing to do all we can to make these homes as comfortable as possible.
"As well as doing all we can to support our residents, we are also investigating exactly what caused this flood."
