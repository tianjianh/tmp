Drivers are being warned of delays as work to upgrade a flood-prone road in Cumbria gets under way.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Temporary traffic lights are in place on the A590, east of Lindal-in-Furness near Ulverston later until 06:00 BST on Monday and for the next three weekends.
Highways England said the road was vulnerable because of surface "dip" and engineers were working on a more "permanent solution".
New drains and gullies are being installed, a spokesman said.
