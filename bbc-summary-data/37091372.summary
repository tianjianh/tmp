The 29-year-old Scot recorded a time of 55.46 seconds, more than a second outside her personal best.
Earlier, Andrew Pozzi and Lawrence Clarke advanced to the semi-finals of the 110m hurdles.
Pozzi, 24, started strongly before clattering the ninth hurdle as he came second in his heat in 13.50 seconds while Clarke, 26, ran 13.55.
Both Pozzi and Clarke qualified after a delay because of torrential rain in Rio.
Two heats had been run in the monsoon-like conditions and six athletes who had not qualified for the semi-finals were allowed to run again.
Jamaica's Deuce Carter, who had initially been disqualified for clipping a hurdle in another lane, won the re-run in a time of 13.50 seconds and was the only one to progress to the next round, at the expense of Serbia's Milan Ristic.

In another 110m hurdles heat, Brazil's Joao Vitor de Oliveira executed a Superman-style dive to qualify for the semi-finals by his fingertips.
"I always do that, it's no accident," he said. "I broke my ribs doing it in China. People tell me not to do it, but it comes from the heart. I put myself first."
American trio Ronnie Ash, Jeff Porter and Devon Allen of the United States also progressed to the next round.
Allen, 21, is hoping to be drafted to play in the NFL in 2017. The University of Oregon student said: "I've got a good chance of being drafted. I'm a wide receiver. It's something to explore."
Jamaican favourite Omar McLeod qualified quickest with a time of 13.27secs.
Meanwhile, Britain's Jade Lally failed to qualify for the final of the women's discus after throwing 54.06m.
BBC Sport's chief sports writer Tom Fordyce in Rio:
"Never before have we seen a virtual time-trial for sprint hurdlers after a weather intervention - heavy rain has caused heats to be scratched before, most recently at the World Championships in Helsinki 11 years ago, but a second chance for those already beaten by the climate makes Deuce Carter a very lucky chap.
"And certainly much more fortunate than Milan Ristic, the previous slowest fastest loser, who first thought he was through to the semi-finals, then was left wondering and waiting, and finally disappointed."
