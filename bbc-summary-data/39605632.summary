Oldham Athletic 1-1 Rochdale

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Rochdale's play-off hopes are still alive after they earned a draw at local rivals Oldham.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Callum Camps struck his ninth goal of the season for Keith Hill's side, but Oldham grabbed the point which guaranteed their League One safety when Peter Clarke headed a second-half equaliser.
Rochdale went ahead in the 13th minute as Nathaniel Mendez-Laing made good progress down the right and crossed to midfield man Camps, who swept in from six yards.
Oldham's Ousmane Fane tested visiting goalkeeper Conrad Logan with a low shot, but Dale controlled the first half and Ian Henderson fired inches wide of the far post.
Calvin Andrew also went close to doubling the lead before Fane wasted a clear Oldham chance just after the break by nodding off target from close range.
The Latics did draw level after 67 minutes, with Jamie Stott delivering a superb free-kick and captain Clarke rising at the far post to convert a four-yard header.
The dangerous Mendez-Laing flashed an effort just wide, while Logan saved from Aaron Amadi-Holloway as the derby honours ended even.
