The island's Chief Minister Allan Bell has sent a letter of condolence to the French Embassy in London to convey the nation's "shock and sadness".
He said the thoughts of the Manx people were with everyone affected by such a "tragic loss of life".
Douglas Council has opened a book of condolence at the capital's town hall.
A minute's silence, followed by a walk of "quiet reflection" from the war memorial in Douglas to the Sea Terminal, will take place at 14:30 GMT on 22 November.
Members of the public have been invited to wear red, white and blue clothing.
Douglas Council Leader David Christian said: "Our hearts go out to the island's French community and to the people of France whose pain we feel. We are shocked and united with them in sadness."
