John Edwards, 61, is planning to be buried on Friday in Halifax and to "bring people words of light from the grave", in a bid to reduce the number of addicts' funerals he has to attend.
The Walking Free charity founder works with suicidal addicts and their families.
Mr Edwards is due to stream his incarceration live via a smartphone.
His coffin, 8ft long, 3.5ft high and 4ft wide (2.4m x 1m x 1.3m), gives him some room to move.
He will receive food and water through a pipe and a second pipe will be connected to a caravan toilet, Mr Edwards told the BBC while standing in the grave as he was digging it.
"I've been to hundreds of funerals and I am so desperate to stop others," he said.
"It's an extreme thing to do, but so is suicide and drug addiction."
Me Edwards hoped he would be able to talk to people while in the ground and give them hope.
"I've been there and done it all, I've really been there. I'm speaking their language.
"I am saying don't end up in a premature grave - that's extreme.
"But extreme times demand extreme measures."
There is to be a team above the ground during his incarceration helping his unusual stay at a community centre.
