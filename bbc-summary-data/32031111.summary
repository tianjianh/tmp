Half-year pre-tax profits at the company fell 67% to £103m.
The results were hurt by a £245m impairment charge relating to its Nordic business.
Game Digital shares fell 5.8% after the retailer reported a 1.8% drop in half-year pre-tax profits to £33.2m. It also said its finance director, Benedict Smith, would be leaving the company later this year.
