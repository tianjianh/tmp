[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Theresa Morrisroe paid the money into her sick father's bank account between 2010 and 2013 while working for the Motor Neurone Disease Association.
Northampton Crown Court heard how she went on to defraud Phoenix IT of more than £24,000.
Martin Gosling, of Northamptonshire Police, said she had committed a "heinous crime".
Morrisroe, 51, of Talbot Road, Northampton, had previously pleaded guilty to two counts of fraud. She was sentenced to two years in jail for the offence against the Motor Neurone Disease Association, and a further year for defrauding Phoenix IT.
Judge Lynn Tayton said the sentences would run consecutively.
Ayesha Bell-Paris, prosecuting, said Morrisroe had worked for the charity as a purchase ledger clerk between 2006 and 2013.
In June 2014 a supplier contacted the charity about an unpaid invoice, which investigations showed had been paid into an account belonging to Morrisroe's ill father,
The charity found payments to another 22 suppliers had been siphoned into this account.
In all, Morrisroe had made 80 fraudulent payments into her father's account and her own.
Miss Bell-Paris said Morrisroe had worked for Phoenix IT after leaving the charity in 2013.
The defence said Morrisroe had financial issues and had been supporting her father, brother and son.
The Motor Neurone Disease Association said the money had been recovered from its insurers, but almost £10,000 had been spent investigating the fraud.
