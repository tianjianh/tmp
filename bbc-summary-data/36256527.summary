A jury at Birmingham Crown Court found Leon Frye guilty of murdering Connor Smith, 19, and Philip Baillie guilty of manslaughter.
They clashed with Connor and his friends in an alleyway in the Hawkesley area of the city in October last year, West Midlands Police said.
Connor, who police said stabbed Frye twice in the row, died at the scene.
