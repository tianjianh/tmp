The original show, based on the Oscar-winning 1980 film, followed the students of the New York City High School for the Performing Arts.
The new series will be set in the present day against the backdrop of a fixation with the world of celebrity.
Lythgoe, who is also a judge on So You Think You Can Dance, will make the show in partnership with MGM TV.
MGM and Lythgoe said in a statement the remake would "expose the gritty struggle, heartache and pain endured in the search for stardom and the often lofty price paid for success".
Lythgoe added: "In my lifetime, I've discovered a great many incredibly talented individuals - some have achieved stardom.
"Simultaneously, I've seen many dreams shattered, egos destroyed and lives changed forever. The end destination may well be fame and fortune, but the road to stardom is littered with broken hearts.
"I look forward to stripping away the glitter and glamour and revealing the true mixture of passion, humanity, exhaustion and sacrifice that these richly talented individuals endure on their road to fame."
The first Fame TV series began in 1982 and ran for five seasons, spawning an album and a number of hit singles.
The film was remade in 2009 with a cast of largely unknown actors in the student roles. However, it was received with muted success, taking only $22m (Â£17.5m) at US box offices.
