Lorry drivers seek increased security checks as stowaway numbers increase

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Lorry drivers are lobbying for more security checks on ferry services to combat growing numbers of stowaways.

More illegal immigrants have been caught between the ports at the Hook of Holland and Harwich so far this year than in the whole of last year.
Josh Fallow, from Norfolk-based Richard Long Transport, said stowaways were becoming a "bigger and bigger problem".
The UK Border Agency has not yet responded to requests for a comment.
Dutch and UK lorry drivers are lobbying for more checks on Stena services crossing the North Sea.
More than 200 stowaways have been detected this year, including 68 at Harwich earlier this month, and another 50 bound for Hull last week.
I was able to board a Stena crossing in the Hook on Tuesday without showing any tickets, or a passport.
It was possible to reach the lorry deck unchecked during the crossing to Essex.
I also found a hole in the fence at the terminal at the Hook into a secure area where trailers were stored.
I spoke with one UK driver in Belgium who had been offered Â£2,500 to smuggle three migrants to the UK only last week.
Lorry drivers were also not security checked before boarding. My passport was shown in Harwich although I only witnessed one lorry being scanned on arrival.
Artur van Dijk, president of Transport and Logistic Nederland, which represents 5,500 truck companies, is lobbying his government and the European Union.
"We are quite worried about the situation," he said. "We all know about the problem at Calais and fear a lot of refugees will change from Calais to the Hook."
Last week representatives from the UK Border Agency travelled to Holland to discuss the stowaway problem with border security counterparts at the Hook.
Krijn Torreman, who owns Dutch-based Mammoet Ferry Transport, said he had spent Â£300,000 on increased security on his 450-strong fleet, but it was not enough to stop three Albanians from stowing away on one of his trailers.
The migrants had broken into a secure area on the Stena-owned dock at the Hook and were sealed by a trafficker. Their attempts to reach the UK were thwarted because the lorry drove inland. They flagged down the driver and were arrested by the police.
Mr Torreman said: "We need to have 100% CO2 control or sniffer dogs. If it continues, the problem will grow in any terminal in Belgium and Holland. We can't protect my drivers if they are on the way anymore. That is the worrying part about it.
"We need the help of the authorities to make sure that we can do safe transport and also that we can protect not just our drivers, but our cargo."
Last week MP Bernard Jenkin said only 6% of lorries arriving at Harwich were checked.
Mr Fallow said he dove heavy agricultural machinery between the Hook of Holland and Harwich in Essex twice a week.
Although he has not been targeted by stowaways so far, he said he was making extra checks on his loads.
"They are trying to find any way they can into the UK," he said. "Some have been found in Rotterdam. That is now going to become a bigger and bigger problem. More of them are going to find their way up here because Calais is getting tighter and tighter."
A spokesman for Stena said the company did not want to respond to the BBC's request for an interview.
