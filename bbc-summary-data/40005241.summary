The 26-year-old, who helped Pompey win the League Two title this term, had moved to Fratton Park in 2015.
He has made 140 league starts so far in a career which has included spells at Shamrock Rovers and Aston Villa.
Stevens played under now-Blades boss Chris Wilder while on loan at Northampton in 2014, either side of two loan spells at Doncaster Rovers.
"He is an attacking full-back and, the way we play, the wide areas are important. Enda provides us with extra options," Wilder told Sheffield United's website.
