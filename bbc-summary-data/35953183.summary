A plane has crash-landed on the Interstate 15 freeway in southern California, hitting a car and killing one of its passengers.

Three others in the car were hurt along with the plane's pilot and passenger.
The plane appeared to be having technical problems before it crash-landed on the freeway in San Diego County near Fallbrook, witnesses said.
In 2000, a former owner guided the same Lancair IV down on to the same freeway after its engine failed.
But this time it landed on its belly before skidding into a nearby car, fatally crushing Antoinette Isbelle, 38, of San Diego, in the back seat.
The vehicle's driver had pulled over to use his phone, California Highway Patrol Officer Chris Parent said.
The plane's pilot, 62-year-old Dennis Hogge and his passenger suffered major injuries, Mr Parent said.
Matt Nokes, a former professional baseball player who made the safe landing in 2000, said he personally knew the pilot, describing him as a good man,
"It's just horrible to hear about,'' he told Associated Press.
Mr Parent said he was aware of three other planes being forced to come down on the same stretch of highway in the past decade.
