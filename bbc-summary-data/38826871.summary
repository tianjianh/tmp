[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Alan Bustin-Mulkern, of Kingsthorpe in Northamptonshire, hopes to depart from the Canary Islands in December.
Although he has completed various ultra-running and mountaineering challenges, Mr Bustin-Mulkern does not have a nautical background.
His preparations are being supported by a team at the University of Northampton.
The 47-year-old plans to row his 10m (33ft) craft 3,000 miles (4,800km) across the ocean to English Harbour in Antigua, in a feat expected to taken between 45 and 60 days.
He will be raising money for the ABF The Soldiers' Charity which supports soldiers, veterans and families.
Mr Bustin-Mulkern, who is a commissioned officer with the Leicester, Northants and Rutland Army Cadet Force, said: "When we're in the centre of the ocean we'll be further from civilization than Tim Peake was in the International Space Station.
"I think that's incredible."
He is working with the university's sports science and psychology units for both physical and mental preparation.
