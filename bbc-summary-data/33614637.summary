[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A new £1.3m transport hub has opened in Tenby, Pembrokeshire.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The interchange is aimed at making it easier for residents, visitors and holidaymakers, by centralising all travel services in one place.
More than 300,000 people use 10 Tenby bus services every year, while National Express and coach trips will also arrive and leave from the site.
It has taken three years to complete the interchange, with Pembrokeshire council and Welsh government funding.
