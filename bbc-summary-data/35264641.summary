Ian Lucas: Extra direct Wrexham-London rail service hopes

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Hopes for more direct train services from Wrexham to London are a step closer, according to the Wrexham MP.

Ian Lucas and other politicians have started talks with rail operators about extending the Shrewsbury to London service to include Wrexham General, Chirk and Gobowen, Shropshire.
Virgin Trains said it was "exploring some initial ideas" with partners.
There is currently one daily train direct to London from Wrexham General Railway Station via Chester.
"There was a feeling that extending these services is a worthwhile goal," said the Wrexham MP.
Since the Wrexham and Shropshire train company - which operated direct services to Marylebone - folded in 2011, all other journeys to the English capital involve changing at least once, usually at Chester or Shrewsbury.
Wrexham community rail officer Sheila Dee said: "We would welcome any improvement to the service.
"The loss of the Wrexham and Shropshire service has been missed by more rural parts of the county.
"And though Wrexham still has one direct London train a day via Chester, the southbound stations don't have that."
Mr Lucas said a further meeting was due to be held with Network Rail, Virgin Trains and Arriva Trains Wales in about four weeks' time.
Meanwhile, a Â£44m project to upgrade the line between Wrexham and Chester is due to be completed this year, which will improve services.
