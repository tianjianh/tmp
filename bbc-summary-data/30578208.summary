The reality show received 3,784 complaints, mainly about the behaviour of its eventual winner Helen Wood and her treatment of housemates.
Celebrity Big Brother was in second place with 1,874 complaints, many of those about Hollywood actor Gary Busey.
Soaps Emmerdale, Coronation Street and EastEnders, also feature in the top 10.
The majority of complaints about Coronation Street related to a kiss between characters Todd and Marcus.
While most of the complaints about EastEnders were about the storyline where Linda Carter, the Queen Vic landlady, was raped.

In third place was Channel 4 documentary Cutting Edge: Going to the Dogs. It received 1,805 complaints about animal cruelty and endorsing criminal behaviour.
Another Channel 4 documentary series, Benefits Street, received 967 complaints about the representation of those on benefits, endorsing criminal behaviour and the welfare of children
