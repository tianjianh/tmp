Telford and Wrekin Council bans election posters on its property

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A council has banned all party political posters on its land and property at the next general election.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Telford and Wrekin Council said during the European elections posters were "defaced" with "quite offensive symbols and quite offensive language".
Posters were also not taken down until "long after" the 14-day period allowed following the election.
The ban, which comes into effect on January 1, will include posters on bus shelters and lamp-posts.
Managing director Richard Partington said: "There's been a European election poster on junction 6 of the M4 for quite a considerable time, and now we are having to get rid of it because it's looking quite a mess."
Although backing the decision, Labour council leader Kuldip Sahota admitted he had been climbing lamp-posts to put up posters for the past 15 years, saying it was "all part of electioneering".
