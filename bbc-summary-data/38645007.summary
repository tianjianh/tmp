The 18-year-old has been part of the London club's FA Youth Cup and Uefa Youth League-winning sides.
Baxter joins a Solihull side 16th in the National League and could be in the squad at Boreham Wood on Saturday.
"I believe this is a real coup for the Moors and shows the strides we are making as a football club," director Jed McCrory told the club website.
"It speaks volumes for a club with the global reputation of Chelsea to trust us with Nathan's development as a young professional at this crucial stage in his career."
