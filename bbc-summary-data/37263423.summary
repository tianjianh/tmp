[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Fernando Forestieri's strike helped Sheffield Wednesday claim their second league win of the season as they overcame Wigan at Hillsborough.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Northern Ireland's Will Grigg had given the visitors the perfect start when he netted after just five minutes.
Scotland striker Steven Fletcher scored his first goal for the Owls to draw the hosts level.
Forestieri then fired home from a tight angle in the second half to help the home side clinch all three points.
The former Watford striker had been denied the chance to give Sheffield Wednesday the lead within 60 seconds of the kick-off as Latics defender Luke Burke pulled off a last-ditch tackle.
Wigan quickly turned defence into attack as Michael Jacobs intercepted Owls midfielder Tom Lees' pass, and his low cross from the left was turned in by Grigg.
A ball over the top of Wigan's defence from Barry Bannan led to Wednesday's equaliser as Fletcher did well to hold off his marker, before angling the ball across goalkeeper Adam Bogdan and into the opposite corner.
The Owls' dominance told in the second half as Forestieri, whose initial cross was cleared straight back to him, scored his second goal of the season.
Sheffield Wednesday head coach Carlos Carvalhal:
"We lost 3-1 at Burnley last season and we discovered our team, we discovered our heart (in that game).
"We want to be the mirror of the city and of the region of Yorkshire. We put our heart on the pitch (against Wigan).
"The most important thing was to win and it was important to take a step forward. We played with quality and we missed some chances, but we won."
Wigan manager Gary Caldwell:
"Sometimes you have to hold your hands up and say the better team won. We got ourselves in a great position scoring a fantastic goal early on.
"We didn't do a lot to score the goal. We got in a good shape which we have been working on and picked off a pass. If we had built on that we could have quietened the crowd.
"We defended for a lot of time and if you do that against good players you are going to get picked off.
"We have lost games by the odd goal and I believe a win is around the corner."
