[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Former-marine Patsy Cullen, 94, of Swansea, will be presented with the Legion d'honneur from France in the town on Thursday.
All surviving D-Day veterans are being recognised by the French government.
Mr Cullen was in a "ghost" unit that seized prisoners and intelligence before they could be destroyed.
He was part of the 30 Assault Unit - co-created by Fleming when he was a Lt Cdr in the Royal Navy - which went ahead of the main forces.
"We had to be first in to get the information before the leaving troops could destroy it," he said, adding his unit captured 100 prisoners in Paris.
Mr Cullen and his fellow veterans are being honoured for their "steadfast involvement in the liberation of France".
