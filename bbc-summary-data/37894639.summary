The attack is said to have happened at a house in Chiseldon, Swindon, on 3 November.
Two of the jockeys, Brendan Powell and Richard Condon, released a statement in which they "denied any allegation of criminal wrongdoing".
All three men have been released on police bail by Wiltshire Police.
Police said two men, aged 21 and 20, were arrested on 4 November and a third, aged 20, was arrested on 5 November.
On Monday, Paul Morris, from BCL Solicitors, said in a statement: "My clients, Brendan Powell and Richard Condon, are subject to a police investigation with which they are co-operating fully.
"Both categorically deny any allegation of criminal wrongdoing and are confident that, in due course, their innocence will become clear to everyone.
"It is not appropriate at this stage to make any further comment."
The British Horseracing Authority said: "Reports concerning the arrest and subsequent release on bail of three BHA-licensed jockeys, following allegations of rape, raise a very serious issue.
"The BHA is considering urgently what action is warranted in the interests of all parties concerned and in the context of the wider sport.
"In the meantime, and at least until we have obtained further details and been able to consider them, the jockeys concerned can continue to ride under our rules."
Paul Struthers, chief executive of the Professional Jockeys Association, said it would liaise with the BHA about what action should be taken over the allegations.
"We are aware of reports that a complaint of a very serious nature has been made to Wiltshire Constabulary regarding three PJA members and await the outcome of that investigation," he said.
"Finally, we would also take this opportunity to remind all our members to avoid speculation, comment or discussion of these allegations on social media and to respect the formal process that has commenced."
