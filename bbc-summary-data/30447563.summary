It is the only machine known to have been personally sold by Apple co-founder Steve Jobs, from a garage in California in 1976.
Fewer than 50 Apple 1 computers are now believed to be in existence.
Yet despite its rarity, the machine was sold at way below auction house Christie's estimate of $400,000-$600,000.
In October, the Henry Ford organization paid $905,000 for one of the computers.
The original Apple Computer - now referred to as the Apple 1 - was hand-made by Steve Wozniak, an engineer who co-founded Apple, with Jobs, in the 1970s. When new, the machines sold for $666.66.
To finance the building of the machines, Jobs sold his VW van, while Wozniak sold a calculator for $500.
