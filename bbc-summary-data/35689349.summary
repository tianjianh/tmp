The Wales Bill: What is it and how will it change?

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Wales Bill has dominated the nation's politics since its publication in draft last autumn.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
It followed a process where the Welsh Secretary Stephen Crabb tried to find consensus among the political groups in the assembly and at Westminster.
Despite the attempt to build consensus the bill has resulted in some fiery rhetoric - with talk of "English vetos" and Lord Elis-Thomas even suggesting it was the worst attempt to re-write the constitution he had ever seen.
Mr Crabb has now proposed substantial changes. But what is the draft Bill, why is it so controversial and how does it affect you?
In simple terms, the Bill takes the law that governs the assembly and Welsh devolution and turns it inside out.
Currently Wales' devolved powers are explicitly set out in a list of so-called "conferred" powers.
The Wales Bill tries to move Wales to a system more like the Northern Ireland assembly and the Scottish parliament.
There, powers kept by Westminster are defined in a set of "reservations". Everything else is assumed to be devolved.
Consensus in the Welsh political scene has been that Wales should move to that way of running things.
It is meant to be clearer and avoid the kind of rows that have landed Welsh legislation in the Supreme Court.
The Bill also offers new powers to the assembly over its own affairs - such as how elections take place and the institution's name - as well as on energy and transport.
The Bill's critics argue the legislation, as it stood, does not achieve Mr Crabb's stated aim of producing a clearer settlement that would stand the test of time.
Opposition politicians and academics have said it could lead to a reversal of devolution and give UK ministers a "veto" over Welsh decisions.
Some have argued it could create even more potential Supreme Court challenges.
There are three specific areas which have attracted criticism:
Stephen Crabb has confirmed the Bill will be delayed until May at the earliest and revealed substantial changes to the areas complained about.
The necessity test will not happen and Mr Crabb will look at shortening the reservation list.
There are changes for minister of crown consents too.
Mr Crabb said he will look at passing control for some of these consents, relating to responsibilities which step into devolved territory still held by UK ministers, to Wales.
There are areas like teachers' pay, which is still controlled from Westminster although education is run from Cardiff.
He has also launched a working group to look at distinct arrangements needed for the growing body of Welsh law - but has stopped short of backing a separate Welsh legal jurisdiction.
Carwyn Jones and others have said the lack of a provision for a Welsh jurisdiction has contributed to the Bill's complexity.
Not entirely. Mr Crabb has indicated for some time now that he was open to changes to the Bill.
And Sunday's conclusions by the Welsh Affairs committee may lead some to think he had little room for manoeuvre.
But there had been no indication Mr Crabb would drop the necessity test entirely.
It is a little too early to say for definite.
Mr Jones did not appear to jump for joy - he said it was "an avoidable delay to clear up an avoidable mess".
But he did say there was an opportunity, "if the will is truly there", to repair the damage done by a flawed process.
That is a good question. This is about how Wales makes its laws and governs itself.
If the people we elect are unhappy with the system they have in front of them it could get in the way of everything else the assembly members are meant to be doing - health and education for instance.
And it is a chance too for those boring, snoring constitutional questions to be cleared away, at least for a time.
The delay does mean that, for now, nothing changes in terms of the kind of laws that the assembly can make.
Promised new powers for the Welsh government may take longer than originally intended.
But the colour of the pavement will not change because the Wales Bill will not be passed before the summer and the wheels of Welsh government will continue to turn.
