Perry Cohen and Austin Stephanos, both 14-year-olds from Tequesta, Florida, have been missing at sea since 24 July.
Captain Mark Fedor says that the search along the Atlantic Coast has been a "true all hands on deck effort".
The Coast Guard has searched about 50,000 square miles (80,467 square km), according to Capt Fedor.
The family will continue a private search, which has been financed by donations. A $100,000 (Â£64,000) reward has also been offered by friends and family for the boys safe return.
Perry and Austin have been described as skilled sailors, who grew up boating and fishing. They had worked together at a local fishing supply store.
Friends and family have held hope that their experience on the water had kept them alive.
Austin and Perry had told their parents they were planning to fish in the nearby Loxahatchee River.
Police were called when the boys failed to answer mobile phone calls and several summer storms had passed through the area.
Their 19ft (6m) boat was discovered capsized on Sunday about 180 miles (209 km) from where they set off two days earlier. Since then no new clues have been discovered.
