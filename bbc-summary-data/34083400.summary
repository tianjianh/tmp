David Sillito: Questioning the vitality of Britain's TV industry

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
It would be good to be able to quote one or two of Frankie Boyle's jokes from this year's Edinburgh TV Festival Awards,  but I can't.  I really can't.  Not here.

What did strike everyone, though, was the strange atmosphere when it was announced that BBC One had won Channel of the Year.  BBC One is by quite some margin,  the best funded and most watched TV channel in Britain.
The award was a surprise. Edinburgh is much more likely to reward the plucky underdog who has been forced to innovate to survive in a world of 576 TV channels. This year, BBC One felt like the underdog.
The TV Festival is an industry event.  It is filled with hopeful young producers and directors wanting to meet the people who might buy and broadcast their programmes.  If a TV commissioner makes a casual aside that it's been a while since someone pitched a programme about  pottery then you can be sure the next six months will be a deluge of ceramic related pitches.
The BBC is in this environment simply a valuable customer for Britain's thriving independent TV industry.  The most common feeling over the years I have attended Edinburgh is the natural tension that arises from small companies desperate to get a decision, and a commissioning process that can be somewhat frustrating.
But something was different this year.
The MacTaggart lecture by Armando Iannucci was standing room only.  He was always going to be entertaining but, more than that, people wanted to hear a passionate defence of public service broadcasting.  He got a standing ovation.
The argument here was one about the vitality of a British industry.
On the face of it seems to be in rude health.  America has been buying up British production companies,  British TV formats continue to spread around the world and the global market for quality drama is growing.
However,  there is also anxiety about the Government's attitude towards the BBC and the questions it is asking about reducing its size and scope.
The BBC  doesn't just buy a lot of programmes,  it buys a lot of programmes that are odd, quirky and risky.   If you want to make money out of television - sell a strange idea to the BBC and see if it works.  Occasionally,  it turns in to a Great British Bake Off or a Top Gear and it's a chance to create a global franchise.
The BBC is more than a customer, it is British TV's laboratory.
It explains much of the anger from people such as Jimmy Mulvile from Hat Trick Productions about the downsizing of BBC Three from a traditional channel to a smaller online only presence.
The audience is small when compared with BBC One but alongside the rest of the multi-channel world it is a giant and what's more, young.
This audience is hard to reach, hard to fathom and vital to the future of TV.   In the arms race to build content that lures teenagers to the big box in the corner of the room, Britain's TV producers worry they have lost their best test site.
And so the arrival of John Whittingdale, the Culture Secretary, at the Edinburgh TV Festival was a key moment.   His appointment to the post was greeted by some newspapers as a declaration of war on the BBC.  Someone was briefing the papers with stories about how this was a chance to cut the BBC down to size.   Was it true?
In the end his words brought a degree of calm to the frayed nerves of the industry.  Did he think the BBC should stop doing entertainment shows? No.  Did he want to dismantle the BBC?  No,  he said.   Did he think its news was biased to the left?  Again, the answer was no.
Armando Iannucci was invited to have a "chat" about his worries.  He said he had enjoyed his dinner conversation with an equally concerned Sue Perkins.
This, however, is a debate that's really only just beginning.    The BBC will in the weeks to come make its case for the future and how it's going to change.  An announcement about plans for its services is expected on 7 September.
But the real window in to what the government is thinking will come when it publishes its white paper on the future of the BBC.
