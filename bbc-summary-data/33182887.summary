Glasgow bin lorry crash driver to answer FAI questions

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The driver of a bin lorry which crashed in Glasgow killing six people and injuring 15 others is to answer questions at a fatal accident inquiry.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A lawyer for Harry Clarke confirmed his client's intentions at a preliminary hearing at Glasgow Sheriff Court.
Sheriff John Beckett QC also confirmed the inquiry would begin on 22 July.
The inquiry will look at the driver's medical background, fitness to hold a licence and the lorry's technical aspects before the 22 December crash.
It also emerged at the hearing that Mr Clarke had never given a police statement since the crash last year.
The Crown Office has already said that he would not be prosecuted.
Erin McQuade, 18, her grandparents Jack Sweeney, 68, and his 69-year-old wife Lorraine, all from Dumbarton, died in the incident in the city's Queen Street and George Square.
Stephenie Tait, 29, and Jacqueline Morton, 51, both from Glasgow, and Gillian Ewing, 52, from Edinburgh, were also killed when the truck mounted the pavement before crashing into the side of the Millennium Hotel.
