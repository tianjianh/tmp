Leicester head coach Aaron Mauger says Ellis Genge "could be world class".

The 21-year-old prop was an unused member of Eddie Jones' 32-man squad for England's summer tour of Australia.
"He has so much potential if we get the little parts right, we saw a glimpse of what he can do against Bath last year," Mauger told BBC Radio Leicester.
"Genge's challenge this year will be getting his scrum sorted, if he's playing against teams with good scrums he's got to be on the money."
Genge, who joined Tigers permanently in May after a four-month loan spell from Bristol, has made five appearances as loose-head for Leicester.
"Marcos Ayerza is still up there for us but it's nice now to have options," Mauger added.
"We now have three quality loose-heads and some of those guys could bounce over and play on the other side of the scrum as well."
