[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Viktorija Ratiuk stabbed 32-year-old Romualds Baluls once in the chest in the flat they shared in Bircham Road, Taunton, on 19 November.
Ratiuk was cleared of murder, but convicted of manslaughter, at a Bristol Crown Court trial.
The court heard a row erupted and Ratiuk attacked Mr Baluls with a knife.
Mr Baluls died from his injury at the scene.
Avon and Somerset Police said: "The decision to use a knife while under the influence of alcohol was catastrophic and Ratiuk will have to suffer the consequences of her impulsive actions."
