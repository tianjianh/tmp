Cardiff's Principality Stadium is being considered to host a future NFL match.

Four matches will be held in London in 2017, two at Wembley and two at Twickenham.
But NFL UK says Cardiff would be an ideal host, if they decided to take it beyond the United Kingdom capital.
"There's not a lot of stadia in the UK that suit our sport. But the Principality Stadium works perfectly," NFL UK managing director Alistair Kirkwood told BBC Wales Sport.
"We've been playing games at Wembley, we've now moved into Twickenham and we've also got a long-term deal with Spurs.

"We've shown we like to play in different stadia.
"I've been to the Principality Stadium as a fan and I've had a couple of conversations with them.
"I think we'd need two teams that would want to stay for a week because of the extra travel.
"But it's certainly in the mix."
Kirkwood was speaking at an NFL UK fans' forum in Cardiff to promote the forthcoming London matches.
"Tonight's event and the passion the Welsh fans have shown speaks volumes.
"It's a really good message for me to take back to New York."
NFL UK director of marketing Charlotte Offord has said Glasgow's Hampden Park and Murrayfield, in Edinburgh, "are well equipped" to host games.
