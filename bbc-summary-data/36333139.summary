[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Portsmouth boss Paul Cook and Plymouth Argyle coach Paul Wotton have each been fined Â£500 after admitting an FA misconduct charge from their League Two play-off semi-final last week.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The pair were sent to the stands in the 11th minute of the first leg at Fratton Park after allegedly using improper language and/or behaviour.
The game finished 2-2, with the Pilgrims winning the return game 1-0.
Both have accepted the fine, which is the standard penalty for the offence.
Plymouth are in the play-off final at Wembley later this month where they will play AFC Wimbledon, who beat Accrington in the other semi-final on Wednesday night.
