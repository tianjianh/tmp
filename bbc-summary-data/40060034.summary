After a spell of high-altitude training in Flagstaff, Arizona, Muir will race in the women's 1500m.
Fellow Scot Andrew Butchart takes on four-time Olympic champion Sir Mo Farah in a congested field of 28 runners in the men's 5,000m.
Lynsey Sharp, the in-form Chris O'Hare and Eilish McColgan are also in action.
Last year's Diamond League series winner Muir, 24, has the fastest personal best time in a competitive field, with over half of the competitors posting best times of sub-four minutes.
Meanwhile, Butchart could better his own Scottish record of 13.08.61 in Oregon, with half the field boasting a global medal in track, cross country or road running.
In the women's 800m, Sharp will be hoping to open her account proper. After descending from Flagstaff, a bout of altitude sickness meant she failed to finish last week's race in Eagle Rock, California.
Following a week at sea level, Sharp will take on the formidable South African Caster Semenya - a double Olympic champion who set the season's fastest time of 1.56.61 in Doha earlier this month.
In the international mile race, O'Hare arrives in the form of his life - just last week, he achieved a personal best and qualifying time for the London World Championships in August.
The event begins on Friday night with Ethiopia's Genzebe Dibaba chasing the world record in the women's 5,000m. Also in the impressive field is European indoor bronze medallist McColgan, who was a finalist at the 2016 Rio Olympics.
