Run by the Education Workforce Council (EWC), it also covers support staff and further education.
The survey asks about being a teacher, the curriculum, workload, professional development and the Welsh language.
EWC chairwoman Angela Jardine said: "It's a golden opportunity for staff across the country to express their opinion with the intention of influencing future education policy."
The results are due to be published in January.
Education Secretary Kirsty Williams said: "I want to work closely with the profession to help teachers be the best they can be, while raising the standing of the profession as a whole.
"This pilot survey will provide a useful source of information for our national mission of education reform."
