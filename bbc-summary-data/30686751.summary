The victim, who was in her 30s, was attacked while walking on Raglan Street, Lowestoft, in January 2005.
Fokrul Islam, 38, from Nevendon Road, Wickford in Essex was found guilty of rape last year at Ipswich Crown Court.
Suffolk Police said the woman reported the attack at the time and this helped secure DNA evidence.
Islam was arrested after he was stopped by the UK Border Agency while travelling from Belfast to Liverpool last year.
Det Con Darren Winchester, from Suffolk Police, said: "Islam's DNA was taken when he was stopped by the UKBA in March 2014 and from that he was identified as a suspect after his DNA matched that taken from the victim in 2005.
"The victim showed immense courage by reporting the rape very quickly and that ensured police were able to secure vital evidence."
