Leicestershire v Kent: Hosts make steady progress on rain-hit second day

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Leicestershire's batsmen made steady progress against Kent on a second rain-hit day at Grace Road.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Rain meant there had been no play possible on day one and just 47.3 overs were played on Saturday.
The hosts lost their first wicket when Paul Horton (48) was trapped lbw by Darren Stevens after lunch.
Harry Dearden (34) and Colin Ackerman (32 not out) then put on a stand of 55 before the former was bowled by Matt Coles.
