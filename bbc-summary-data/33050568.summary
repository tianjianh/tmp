County Championship: Jonny Bairstow hits ton against Middlesex

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Jonny Bairstow's unbeaten 125 was backed up by Yorkshire's seam attack as they put Division One leaders Middlesex under pressure at Headingley.

They were tottering on 96-6 when Toby Roland-Jones (4-78) claimed two wickets in the first three balls of day two.
Bairstow hit four sixes and 10 fours and added 59 with last man Jack Brooks before they were all out for 229.
Brooks then dismissed Joe Burns and Nick Compton as Middlesex moved to the close on 127-4, a lead of 110.
Dawid Malan (33) and James Franklin (26) will resume their 55-run stand on the third morning and if they can turn it into a substantial partnership, then the balance of the game could tilt in their direction.
Bairstow's 187-ball innings was in marked contrast to the rest of Yorkshire's batting, with Jack Leaning's 20 the next highest score.
Leaning was caught behind off the first ball of the day and overseas signing Glenn Maxwell followed two deliveries later as Roland-Jones boosted Middlesex's hopes of a first-innings lead despite their own modest total of 212.
But Yorkshire's tail supported Bairstow long enough for him to reach three figures off 161 balls with a boundary off James Harris and earn them a slender advantage of 17 runs.
Burns (20) and Sam Robson soon cleared the deficit, but the loss of the former and Nick Compton to successive deliveries by Brooks was a major setback.
Robson (34) was then lbw to Patterson, who bowled 14 miserly overs for figures of 1-14, and the visitors also lost Neil Dexter before the close.
Yorkshire coach Jason Gillespie:
"It's one of the best innings you will see in Championship cricket. I thought the way he batted with the lower order was simply outstanding.
"In the context of the game and the situation we found ourselves in, to gain a first-innings lead was fantastic.
"We are quite fortunate at Yorkshire to have Jonny in this game. The (England) selectors haven't picked him so all Jonny can do is score as many runs as possible and keep (wicket) as well as he can.
"We shouldn't expect him to be around at Yorkshire because I think England honours will come sooner rather than later."
