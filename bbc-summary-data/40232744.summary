Angela Mitchell has been named as the new Head of Bell Tower.
The Minster dismissed its bell-ringers in October, over "safeguarding issues".
Mrs Mitchell, a member of the former bell-ringing team, said she applied for the job to ensure the Minster's "magnificent bells ring out again each Sunday and for other key occasions".
The bells at the cathedral have only been rung intermittently since the mass sacking, including at the Service of Nine Lessons and Carols in December.
Mrs Mitchell, who has been appointed on a 12-month contract, added: "The recent history of bell ringing at the Minster has been difficult and there is some healing to do.
"However I am really looking forward to working with the new team and I hope that the news of my appointment will help to move things forward."
A spokesperson for the Minster said: "One of Angela's first tasks will be to help recruit and establish the Minster's new band of volunteer bell-ringers.
"The Minster received applications from 42 bell-ringers from York and the wider region with more than three quarters of the applications coming from members of the previous band."
Recruitment and induction of the new ringing team is due to take place this summer and it is hoped the team will fully up and running in the early autumn.
