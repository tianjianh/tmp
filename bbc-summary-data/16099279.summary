[SN]TITLE[SN]
Julian Fellowes to write Wind in the Willows musical

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Julian Fellowes is to write a new musical adaptation of Kenneth Grahame's novel The Wind in the Willows.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Downton Abbey creator will reunite with composer and lyricist duo George Stiles and Anthony Drewe for the project.
The trio previously collaborated on Cameron Mackintosh's West End and Broadway production of Mary Poppins.
The new show will be created for the West End, although dates and a theatre venue have yet to be announced.
Fellowes said: "The Wind in the Willows is one of our greatest classics and as true and entertaining now as it has ever been.
"I am delighted and tremendously flattered to have been asked to write the book [narrative] for the new musical.
"In fact, I suspect this is something I've been wanting to do subconsciously for many years."
Stiles added: "We all celebrate our English roots as writers and the musical possibilities of Kenneth Grahame's classic chime very strongly with me.
"The book itself is packed with music and songs so I can't wait to find the sounds to score Ratty, Mole, Badger, Toad and their adventures."
The musical will be produced by Jamie Hendry Productions, whose recent shows include Legally Blonde the Musical, Birdsong, Spring Awakening and La Cage Aux Folles.
