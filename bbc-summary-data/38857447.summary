[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Marian Dorobek was held at Heysham Port after travelling from the Isle of Man on Wednesday afternoon.
The 68-year-old had fled Poland after committing rape and child sex offences. He was convicted in his absence and was facing a prison sentence.
Dorobek was transferred to HMP Wandsworth in London ahead of an extradition hearing.
Officers from Lancashire Police made the arrest after receiving a tip-off about Dorobek's impending arrival.
The Polish government has thanked the force for its swift intervention.
Insp Phil Hutchinson said: "This is a great example of a number of disciplines from within the constabulary coming together at a moment's notice to facilitate an arrest.
"Our prompt actions have resulted in an extremely dangerous offender being taken off the streets.
"Our thought and best wishes remain with the victims of the horrendous crimes he has committed."
