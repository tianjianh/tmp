Thousands watch the Hogmanay fireworks on Calton Hill but City of Edinburgh Council has decided to close it as "the hill is unlit and uneven under foot".
Some fireworks are also fired from the hill as part of the midnight display and there will now be no access to the hilltop from 19:00 on 31 December.
The council said the decision had been made with the police and Unique Events.
Richard Lewis, the city council's festivals and events champion, said: "The draw of spectators to Calton Hill is understandable and the view undeniable - which is why the Torchlight Procession to herald the start of the three-day Edinburgh's Hogmanay festival entices 10,000 torchbearers and 20,000 visitors on 30 December.
"Edinburgh's Hogmanay invests in stewarding and additional lighting to help people stay safe during the Torchlight Procession and this year's display will be just as dazzling.
"New year's eve is the busiest night of the year in our city centre.
"The safety of the public is our key priority and as Calton Hill is used as a fireworks zone, it will be closed during the Hogmanay celebrations.
"The gates will shut at around 19:00 on Hogmanay through to 01:00 on 1 January.
"There are plenty of other vantage points in the city to view the fireworks, from Inverleith Park to the Meadows, but the best place to soak up the New Year atmosphere and to view the display remains the official Edinburgh's Hogmanay Street Party."
