The Imaging Centre of Excellence will be based at the new South Glasgow University Hospital, which is due to open in 2015.
The centre is part of a new Precision Medicine facility, which aims to pioneer more personalised treatments.
The funding was agreed as part of the Glasgow and Clyde Valley City Deal.
Deputy First Minister John Swinney described the funding as "great news" for the new hospital.
"The state-of-the-art Imaging Centre of Excellence (ICE) will give Scotland a comparative advantage in clinical research.
"It will provide innovation facilities for our life science companies to support the development of products and services which will help the NHS meet Scotland's complex health needs."
Glasgow City Council leader Gordon Matheson, Leader of Glasgow City Council, said the new hospital would have "world-beating facilities".
"Glasgow is now very well placed to gain in both health and economic terms from such centres," he said.
