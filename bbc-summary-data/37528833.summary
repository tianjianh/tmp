Police have released descriptions of two men wanted in connection with the rape of a 14-year-old girl on her way to school in Oxford.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
She was raped after being snatched from a street and forced into a car on Wednesday morning.
The girl, wearing a school uniform, was forced into a silver hatchback car as she walked in the Banbury Road area of Summertown between 08:15 - 08:40 BST.
Thames Valley Police has issued detailed descriptions of the men.
The first offender is a white man who spoke with a northern accent.
He has been described by the girl as aged in his mid twenties, balding with shaven dark blonde hair. He has blue eyes is of medium build and about 6ft (1.82m) tall.
He was wearing a hooded top with one pocket on the front and no drawstrings or logo, and black trousers.
The second man is white with brown gelled hair, is cleanly shaven and has brown eyes.
He is aged in his late teens or early 20s.
He is described as slightly smaller in build than the first offender.
Det Supt Chris Ward, said: "Please rest assured that we are carrying out a thorough investigation but we also need the help of the public to bring these offenders to justice."
The teenager was found at midday by a member of public after knocking on doors to get help in Cavendish Drive, Marston.
The girl has since been receiving support from specialist officers.
Extra patrols were deployed in the area amid a major operation to find the two men.
At a press conference on Thursday, it was said the girl was approached and possibly hugged, something that could have looked relatively innocent to witnesses.
