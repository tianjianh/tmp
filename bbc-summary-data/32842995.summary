Headlines and hectoring: the story of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's visit to Belfast

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Headlines and hectoring, pickets and preachers - Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's visit to Belfast in May 1925 was anything but elementary.

When the literary heavyweight was invited to the city 90 years ago, it was not in the capacity for which he is most well-known - as the creator of master detective Sherlock Holmes.
Instead, he was on a crusade to spread the word on spiritualism, the religious faith centred on communication with the spirits of the dead.
Conan Doyle was a convert to the religion, and poured his time, effort and personal fortune into its development around the globe.
Such was his influence, he was referred to as the 'St Paul of Spiritualism', having written numerous publications on the subject and toured the world delivering lectures on it.
And now it was the turn of Belfast to hear his addresses. Two nights in the Ulster Hall were scheduled and promptly sold out.
One Belfast man who has just delivered his own lecture of the topic - in the Ulster Hall, of course - says controversy followed Conan Doyle wherever he went, and Belfast was no exception.
"The demand to hear him speak was huge," says Oscar Ross, of The Crew of the SS May Day, Northern Ireland's Sherlock Holmes Society.
"But the churches would've all been united against spiritualism and Conan Doyle came under attack from the mainstream Christian press and the pulpit, long before he even reached Belfast."
On Sunday 12 May, the day of Conan Doyle's arrival, sermons in opposition to his message began.
Letters pages in the newspapers were another battleground, and in between his social engagements and a day-trip to the Giant's Causeway, Conan Doyle fired off a response to the barbs he was receiving.
The Belfast Telegraph mailbag was brimming with correspondence on the visit, so much so that the newspaper's editor decided enough was enough: "The number of letters received on this subject has become so great that it is quite impossible to make space for them."
On the evenings of the lectures, 12 and 13 May, queues four-deep formed outside the Ulster Hall, while opponents handed out Biblical tracts with messages vehemently against what many described as the "spiritualist cult".
Inside the hall, virtually every seat was taken, and Conan Doyle told his listeners that in spiritualism they had something more solid than faith.
The lectures were an "intellectual treat", according to the Telegraph. "Sir Arthur is a gifted and racy speaker," it added.
The spiritualist movement was buoyed and Conan Doyle left the following day. But not everyone was impressed.
"The debate raged on in the newspaper columns," Mr Ross says. "An editorial in the Northern Whig had a snipe, saying: 'The lecturer's attitude of benevolent incredulity was neither enlightening, nor convincing.'"
The Telegraph decided to publish one more letter on the matter, this time from Conan Doyle himself.
He had clearly been stung by some aspects of the reception he had received in the city.
"He points out what he called the 'prejudice' encountered in Belfast," Mr Ross says. "He writes in the letter: 'One paper refused entirely to advertise my lectures.'
"And he also mentions the pickets, what he calls the 'abusive handbills'. The fact he picks up on those things may indicate that one or two of these things may have been unique to the Belfast experience."
More anti-spiritualist sermons followed right through into July, with one preacher taking the lead for the opposition.
"The man who was the big figure against Conan Doyle's visits was Pastor W.E. Tocher," Mr Ross says. "He was a fiery preacher, and he hired the Ulster Hall for a reply to Conan Doyle within two weeks of the lectures.
"Again, the hall was packed to its utmost capacity, and Tocher's chief arguments against spiritualism were based on scriptural quotations."
So, what was the lasting legacy of the visit, if there was one at all?
Michael Flood, who is writing a book on the history of spiritualism in Ireland, says it paved the way for the first spiritualist church in Ireland to open in the city.
"The visit came just at the right time, because it helped spiritualists to come out of the shadows, gave them the ability to speak about it and see they weren't alone," he says.
"People still refer to it as the catalyst that brought people to the religion. It was a wholehearted success and I'm sure even Conan Doyle himself didn't realise how much."
But the religion never blossomed worldwide as Conan Doyle had envisaged, remaining only on the fringes.
"I think if you were to have asked Conan Doyle, he would've wanted to be known as an exponent of spiritualism," Mr Ross says.
"But today he is known almost entirely as the creator of Sherlock Holmes. I don't think that's the legacy he wanted to leave."
