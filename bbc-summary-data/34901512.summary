A joyrider nicknamed "Monster" who struck and killed a schoolboy in front of his mother has been jailed - more than 10 years after the boy's death.

Five-year-old Samuel Walker was fatally injured in the hit-and-run collision in Chorlton, Manchester, in February 2003.
Nawnee Mackin, 35, was charged with causing death by dangerous driving after police reopened an investigation in 2012 into the boy's death.
He was jailed for nine years after a trial at Manchester Crown Court.
The court heard how Samuel had been crossing Hardy Lane in Chorlton with his mother and 11-year-old sister as they made their way to his grandmother's house.
He was thrown on to the car's bonnet and killed instantly, days before his sixth birthday.
Mackin, who was 23 at the time, had no licence or insurance and was said to have reached speeds of up to 50mph in the Mitsubishi Gallant.
Despite an extensive investigation at the time, police were unable to identify the driver of the car, which had been taken for a joyride around the Merseybank Estate in Chorlton.
But Mackin was later identified after fresh information came to light.
He was also picked out by Samuel's mother Jacqueline Tocmak in an identity parade.
Mrs Tocmak said she would have "fought for justice until the day I died".
In a statement read to the court, she said: "The day Samuel was killed my heart was ripped out.
"There is not a day I do not think of Samuel. I often relive the events of that day. His sister then aged 11 saw him die. Twelve years later she still cries herself to sleep.
"Getting justice for Samuel has brought me a step closer for closure for my family and I."
Sgt Lee Westhead, of Greater Manchester Police, said he was sorry the case was not resolved sooner.
He paid tribute to Samuel's family for the "patience and dignity" they had shown.
He added: "In particular I would like to recognise the bravery of Samuel's mother who had to suffer the ordeal of giving evidence about the events of that tragic day."
