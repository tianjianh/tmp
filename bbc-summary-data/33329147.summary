Photographs from classic film Brief Encounter which have not been seen for 70 years are about to go on display.

They are part of an exhibition about the life and works of director Sir David Lean, which opens at Carnforth Station, in Lancashire, on Wednesday.
Lean filmed much of Brief Encounter - which starred Celia Johnson and Trevor Howard - at the station in early 1945.
Many of the shots, such as the one with Johnson in the tea room, are from the Lean family private collection.
John Adams, manager of Carnforth Station Heritage Centre, said that Lean's son Peter had "picked them up off the cutting room floor".
Other pictures were donated by actress Margaret Barton, now 89, who played the young waitress Beryl in the film.
"David Lean was one of the most famous and prolific directors of the 20th Century," said Mr Adams.  "The renovation of the station, refreshment rooms and the famous clock - all featured in the film Brief Encounter - form a worthy tribute to David and his work."
He hoped the exhibition would help bring in up to 20,000 visitors by the end of the year.
Brief Encounter is regarded as one of the best British films of the 20th Century.
It tells the story of housewife Laura Jesson (Johnson) who begins an affair with married doctor Alec Harvey ( Howard) after he helps remove a piece of grit from her eye in a station refreshment room.
As filming took place during World War Two, Carnforth was chosen as a location by the Ministry of War Transport as it was remote and safe from attack.
Filming was between 22:00 and 06:00 so the station could run as normal during the day.
In 1946, Brief Encounter was nominated for three Oscars - for director, actress and screenplay.
All 16 of Lean's films - which include Great Expectations, The Bridge on the River Kwai, Lawrence of Arabia, Doctor Zhivago and A Passage to India - will be shown at the Carnforth Station Heritage Centre over the year.
The exhibition runs 1 July - 31 December (free admission).
