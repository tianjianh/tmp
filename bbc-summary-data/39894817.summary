It's called the Lunar Palace and would give astronauts the chance to stay on the surface for months and even grow their own food.
Four people have gone into the pod to live for the next 60 days.
China does not expect to land its first astronauts on the moon for at least another ten years, but the project seeks to help the country prepare lunar explorers for longer stays on the surface.
