Aberdeen city polling cards contain 'Scotalnd' error

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Aberdeen City Council has said it did not plan to reprint thousands of polling cards which contain a prominent spelling error.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The cards, for the Scottish parliamentary election on 5 May, spell Scotland as "Scotalnd".
The error was not spotted until the official notification started to be delivered to voters in the city.
The authority said it accepted the mistake was "disappointing and embarrassing".
A spokeswoman for the Returning officer said: "This is a very disappointing, and of course, a very embarrassing proofing error.
"The 175,000 poll cards distributed will not be replaced as this unfortunate spelling mistake in no way invalidates the poll cards."
