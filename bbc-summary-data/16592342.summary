[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A Sark Tourism Officer has reported a rise in visitor numbers following the island gaining Dark Sky status.

Karen Adams said the access ability for star-gazing meant winter holidays in the island could be advertised.
Sark was granted Dark Sky status in January 2011 by the International Dark-Sky Association, which recognises star-gazing locations around the world.
Ms Adams said the combination of clear night skies and a range of hotels and campsites made it an ideal destination.
