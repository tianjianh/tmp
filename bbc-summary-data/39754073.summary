Sons' Lewis Vaughan clipped the bar with a first-half effort and Sam Stanton had a shot well saved by Falkirk keeper Robbie Thomson.
Austin bagged the winner five minutes from time, nodding home from Luke Leahy's fine cross.
The result means Falkirk face one less play-off round as they look to secure promotion to the Premiership.
