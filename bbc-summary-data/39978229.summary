Gibbons famously marked her Olympic semi-final victory by mouthing 'thank you mum' in memory of her mother, who died in 2004 from leukaemia.
She is also the only British women to win a medal at the Tokyo Grand Slam after taking a bronze in the prestigious season-ender in 2015.
"I'm looking forward to my next career as a PE teacher," said Gibbons.
"At the age of six, when I first stepped onto the mat, I couldn't have dreamt what was to come.
"Medals, the best memories and friends, and even a husband, I feel extremely lucky.
"I can't explain how much I've loved having the job 'judo player' but I feel I've given the sport I love everything I have to give.
"I'll be hoping to share the wonderful sport that has helped shape me into the person I am today with the many young people I encounter."
Gibbons, who is married to Scottish two-time world bronze medallist Euan Burton, failed to qualify for Rio 2016.
Instead Wales' Natalie Powell was Britain's representative in the weight division, finishing seventh.
