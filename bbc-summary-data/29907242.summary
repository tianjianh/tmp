"We've played well today, moved the ball well, created chances and scored four goals, so I've got to be happy.
"In the FA Cup you've just got to get through and we've done that today.
"As far as I'm concerned, we need to approach this competition as we would a Football League match - absolutely 100%."
Newport County manager Justin Edinburgh told BBC Radio Wales:
"We're bitterly disappointed not to have got something out of the game in the end.
"We went behind from a poor decision, a blatant free-kick. A couple of key decisions have gone against us.
"We got back into the game, I thought we played really, really well at times.
"We'll put in a report, highlight those key incidents that we feel continuously went against us."
