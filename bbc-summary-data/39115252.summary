The facility will house an auditorium, music, film and photography studios and a library.
It is due to open next summer, to coincide with new courses in filmmaking and music performance.
It comes as the college applies to become the first specialist arts university in the North.
The new building is being built on the car park next to the Blenheim Walk campus.
Principal Simone Wonnacott said: "As we move forward with our purpose-built expansion, and add new courses to our portfolio, we will attract more students to the city offering them a greater diverse mix of creative courses.
"Our new build project coincides with our application to become a university, which will see the college becoming the only specialist arts university in the North of England, which we hope to make an announcement about later in the year."
The building work is being part financed by HSBC, and has been designed by DLA Design.
As well as the new facilities for teaching and performance, it will have solar energy panels and a roof garden.
