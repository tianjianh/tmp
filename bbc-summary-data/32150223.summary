William Kerr, 53, absconded from a bail hostel in Hull following his release on 23 January.
He was jailed for life in 1998 for the murder of Maureen Comfort in Leeds.
North Yorkshire Police said Kerr, who speaks with a Scottish accent, needed to be arrested and returned to prison "as a matter of urgency".
A spokesperson said he was known to have links to Humberside, as well as West Yorkshire and London.
Ms Comfort, 43, was strangled to death at her flat at Cromwell Heights, where she had lived alone, in 1996.
Her body was found in a cupboard in her bedroom by her family after they became concerned they had not heard from her.
Two years later Kerr was found guilty of her murder at Leeds Crown Court.
Police issued a recent photo of Kerr and urged people to "keep an eye out for him".
Det Insp Eamonn Clarke said: "To assist our already extensive efforts to trace William Kerr, I am urging people to keep an eye out for the man in the photographs.
"We believe he is now in the London area and he may be trying to book into a hostel or other accommodation using a false name as he has done previously.
"We ask that you do not approach Kerr, as he is considered dangerous."
Det Insp Clarke urged Kerr "to do the right thing and hand yourself in to the police".
North Yorkshire Police said it was leading the hunt for Kerr as his probation officer was based in Selby but there was "no evidence at this time to suggest that he is currently in North Yorkshire".
