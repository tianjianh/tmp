A nurse who gave a patient a lethal overdose of a prescription drug has been found not guilty of manslaughter by gross negligence.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Amanda Young, 40, slumped in the dock at Bristol Crown Court as the verdict was read out.
Joshua Gafney, 22, died after she administered 14 times the dose of anti-psychotic Clozapine in February 2012.
During trial, Ms Young said she had "not seen" details of the drug's strength written on the bottle's label.
Witnesses described the nurse, from Yeovil, Somerset, as "kind and empathetic" and dedicated to her profession.
The court was told Mr Gafney had serious mental health issues and was suffering from paranoid schizophrenia.
Ms Young was instructed to give him 6ml - a little more than a teaspoon - of Clozapine but the court heard she "hadn't seen" the dosage written on the medication.
Instead, she poured six bottles into a glass for him.
Mr Gafney drank the glass, containing 84ml, and was pronounced dead two hours later.
Defence barrister, Elizabeth Marsh QC, had told jurors at least two other nurses had given Mr Gafney similar doses in the days leading up his death.
She described Ms Young's actions as "a mistake by a compassionate and focused nurse".
