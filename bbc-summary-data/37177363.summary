Candles on the Cobb illuminated Lyme Regis harbour with more than 5,000 tea lights on five occasions since 2000.
Founder Phil Street said committee members were "burnt out" by planning the event but it had surpassed expectations.
It had raised money for local youth organisations and national charities.
Mr Street and friend came up with the idea while listening to Elton John's Candle in the Wind in 1998.
They first covered the Cobb, a long jetty which dates back to the 14th Century, with tea lights in 2000, raising £4,600. Subsequent events raised more than £130,000 for local and national charities.
"It's been a fantastic event but we've reached our pinnacle. As a spectacle it was unique - people were in awe looking at it. The emotions were just amazing," he said.
He added the amount of "effort, pre-planning and co-ordination needed" led the organising committee to make the decision not to stage another event after the last one in 2015.
