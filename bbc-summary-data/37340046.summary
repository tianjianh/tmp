As Sally Richmond took off from Salford's City Airport on Sunday, Jamie Dell and friends laid out the proposal near the runway in rolls of wallpaper.
A spokesman for the Barton airfield said Ms Richmond saw it on her return and accepted over the plane's radio.
Once she landed, Mr Dell presented her with an engagement ring while down on one knee alongside the cockpit.
