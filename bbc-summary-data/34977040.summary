[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A South African appeals court will announce on Thursday whether it will change athlete Oscar Pistorius' manslaughter conviction to murder.

The Paralympic sprinter shot girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp through a locked bathroom door in February 2013 but said he mistook her for an intruder.
He was convicted of culpable homicide, or manslaughter, eight months later.
State prosecutors say Pistorius should instead have been convicted of murder and want his prison term increased.
They say the jail term should rise from five years to a minimum of 15 years.
The court heard the state prosecutors' appeal on 3 November.
The five appeal court judges did not consider the facts but the application of the law, in a highly technical case.
The judgement is due to be delivered by the Supreme Court of Appeal at 09:45 (07:45 GMT) on 3 December.
The Paralympian was transferred to house arrest last month after serving one year of his five-year term.
