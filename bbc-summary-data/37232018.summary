UK-Bangladeshi journalist Shafik Rehman granted bail

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Supreme Court of Bangladesh has ordered the release on bail of magazine editor Shafik Rehman following his arrest on suspicion of sedition.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 81-year-old was held in April after police linked him to a conspiracy to murder the son of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina.
Mr Rehman, a UK and Bangladeshi national, has been granted bail for three months.
His supporters describe his arrest as politically motivated.
Mr Rehman was the editor of Jai Jai Din, a mass-circulation Bengali daily, and, at the time of his arrest, he edited Mouchake Dhil, a popular monthly magazine.
He was also an adviser to opposition leader Khaleda Zia, who has continually demanded his unconditional release.
Several press freedom groups recently signed a letter urging Bangladesh to release him.
Prior to his arrest, Mr Rehman convened the international affairs committee of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) and headed a pro-opposition think-tank called G-9.
Mr Rehman is the third pro-opposition editor to be detained since 2013.
Mahfuz Anam, editor of the English-language Daily Star newspaper, has been accused of treason for accusing Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina of corruption in 2007 when the country was run by a military government.
BBC South Asia correspondent Justin Rowlatt reported in February that both The Daily Star and its sister publication Prothom Alo were being subjected to a clandestine attempt to undermine their finances and stifle their operations.
