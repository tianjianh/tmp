Denbighshire village launches bid to run local shop

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
As bank closures bite and shops disappear from rural communities, one Denbighshire village has come up with a solution.

Cynwyd's shop and post office has been on the market for years - and the community was dismayed to hear the owners would lose the business if a buyer was not found.
A public meeting was held, and the Siop Ni Cynwyd community enterprise formed.
They hope to get funding to keep the shop open.
Delyth Thomas of Siop Ni Cynwyd said the shop was "right at the heart of the community" - and that it would be "dreadful" if it was lost.
"Not only does it provide an all-important service, ensuring that we all have access to some of our daily essentials, but it also acts as a community hub, with friends and neighbours having time to catch up on local issues and bind the community together," she said.
"We are exploring all possible avenues to see what can be done to keep it in the community".
Residents say they would have to travel far to be able to access basic financial services, while a lack of public transport means the village is isolated.
The new group, which has 65 members, has received advice from the Wales Co-op Centre, housing association Grwp Cynefin and the Cadwyn Clwyd rural development agency.
They are working on a study to explore the best options available.
Mabon ap Gwynfor, chair of Siop Ni Cynwyd said: "A lot of people have come forward willing to assist in this venture.
"This is a true community enterprise with everybody offering their services and chipping in. There is certainly a lot of good will."
