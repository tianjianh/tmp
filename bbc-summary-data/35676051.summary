The Chester top scorer was fed by Danny O'Brien, passing defender Rob Swaine before slamming the ball past Bromley goalkeeper Alan Julian.
Striker Moses Emmanuel atoned for a first-half miss to bring the visitors level just after half-time, bundling in Jordan Chapell's corner.
Steve Burr's Chester remain 17th, five points above the relegation places.
Mid-table Bromley stand eight points better off in 13th.
Chester manager Steve Burr told BBC Radio Merseyside:

"Looking a stats from crosses into the box in the first half we should have added to the one we scored, we knocked it about quite well.
"When we concede you can see the confidence draining from the players. When you're not winning you get criticised and you've got to deal with that.
"It's something some of these young lads aren't used to. I'm not saying they don't want the ball but they're frightened to make a mistake, and I think after Bromley got the equaliser you can see a bit of anxiety come back to us."
