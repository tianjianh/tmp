More than 150 dogs had to be rescued in 2014, when an adoption centre was destroyed in a big blaze.
Since then, people have donated more than a million pounds to help the adoption centre rebuild, and it's finally ready to open.
The new centre is better than ever, with glass windows and doors on each kennel, and even underfloor heating!
The dogs seem pretty happy with their new pad.
