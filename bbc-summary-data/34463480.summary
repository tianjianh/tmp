[SN]TITLE[SN]
Art and culture put on the map in Dumfries and Galloway

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An online "cultural map" has been launched, which shows where creative businesses and people are based in Dumfries and Galloway.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Those behind the idea describe it as a "What's Where" and "Who's Who" website which brings the region's creative industry together in one place.
Website users will be able to search it to find individuals, organisations, businesses and places to visit.
They will also be able to find local listings and news websites.
The map was commissioned and funded by Dumfries and Galloway Council, Creative Scotland and Dumfries and Galloway's Leader programme.
