Kevin Ackerman: Towcester racecourse boss has ban upheld

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Towcester racecourse chief executive Kevin Ackerman has failed in his bid to overturn a six-month suspension from racing.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Ackerman was initially banned in October last year after being found guilty of corruption.
He had laid bets against a horse knowing its jockey aimed not to win.
Ackerman was granted a stay of implementation in November, but his disqualification has been reactivated with immediate effect until 11 June.
However, his fine of £5,000 was quashed upon appeal, at the invitation of the British Horseracing Authority.
Ackerman was banned after an investigation into six races featuring Ad Vitam at Kempton and Wolverhampton between 2 November, 2011 and 8 March, 2012.
He was found to have breached the rules of racing alongside jockey Michael Stainton, registered owner Kenneth Mackay and former owner David Greenwood.
Stainton was banned for two years, Mackay for six months and fined £5,000, with Greenwood, who had already been warned off for a separate offence, banned for eight years. All three also failed in their appeals, although, a separate appeal by Stainton against the penalty imposed "will be considered in due course".
Stewart-Moore Solicitors, who represent Ackerman, Greenwood and Mackay, said in a statement that the "matter needs to be resolved by a High Court judge".
"Messrs Ackerman, Greenwood and Mackay have not acted in breach of the rules of racing in any way," they added.
"In spite of this they have been found, yet again, to have taken part in a conspiracy that has never been properly put to them."
