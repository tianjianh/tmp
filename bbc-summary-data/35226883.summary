Hankey, who took the title in 2000 and 2009, won only one leg in the match.
His fellow Englishman Jamie Hughes, the number four seed, beat Scotland captain Ross Montgomery 3-0.
World number three Jeffrey de Graaf lost 3-2 to fellow Dutchman Richard Veenstra and was one of three seeds to exit the tournament on Monday.
Martin Atkins eased past 14th seed Pip Blackwell 3-0 in an all-English contest, while Larry Butler of the USA beat Dutch 16th seed Ryan de Vreede 3-2 to book a second-round tie with world number one Glen Durrant.

John Walton, the 2001 champion, dropped only three legs in his 3-0 preliminary-round win over Australia's Rob Modra.
In the women's draw, number four seed Aileen de Graaf defeated English teenager Casey Gallagher 2-0 to reach the quarter-finals.
Hankey was playing at the BDO World Championships for the first time since 2012, following a switch to the PDC circuit and a period of ill health.
Speaking after Sunday's preliminary-round win over Dave Cameron, Hankey said he had played "like a total plonker" and conceded he would have to improve to beat the vastly experienced Phillips.
Both players struggled early on - Phillips needed 26 darts to win a nervy first leg and, as Hankey continued to miss chances at doubles, the Welsh left-hander clinched the first two sets.
Hankey appeared disturbed by a section of the Lakeside audience on at least two occasions and changed the pace of his throw in a bid to find some rhythm, but it was to no avail as Phillips ran out a comfortable winner.
Richard Veenstra: "It was a great match. I'm sorry for Jeffrey but I'm happy to be in the next round. I have to book another boat home. I think I'll stay until Monday now."
John Walton: "Emotions were riding high but I just relaxed and played darts. I haven't been on the circuit for a year so nobody knows how I'm playing. I'm just enjoying myself again. I felt so relaxed."
BBC pundit Bobby George on Walton's win: "John scored well and finished well. Sometimes his finishing lets him down a little bit but today there was no messing."
England's three-time champion Martin Adams faces a difficult start to his World Championship campaign on Tuesday, with Canada's Jeff Smith his first-round opponent (13:00 GMT, live on BBC Two).
Smith lost at the semi-final stage 12 months ago and impressed in his preliminary-round win over Matthew Medhurst.
Dutch fifth seed Wesley Harms, twice a World Championship semi-finalist, and Belgium's World Trophy winner Geert de Vos are also in first-round action on Tuesday.
