The medieval cloisters, the driveway and the exterior of Lacock Abbey will be transformed with colour and light.
Former owner of the abbey, William Henry Fox Talbot, developed his "art of photogenic drawing" 175 years ago.
He shared the image of one of the Wiltshire abbey's windows in 1839.
The lights are part of the second Illuminating Lacock Abbey light festival by the National Trust and marks a year celebrating Fox Talbot's achievements.
Kristine Heuser, from the National Trust, said: "This year our focus is on Lacock as the birthplace of photography."
She said the theme of the display was "The Window" to celebrate the window at Lacock Abbey depicted in Fox Talbot's photographic negative.
"The illuminations add a whole new layer to the experience, so we're encouraging visitors from last year to come back too," Ms Heuser said.
Illuminating Lacock Abbey runs from 16:00 to 19:00 GMT every evening until 9 February.
