Almost 100 set off from Selkirk town centre on Saturday before the real race took place on 75km (46 miles) of forest track on Bowhill estate.
The event coincided with the Selkirk Mountain Bike (MTB) Marathon, a non-competitive event for 500 riders.
On Friday the sport was celebrated at The Selkirk Mountain Bike Festival.
Organiser Paul McGreal said the events created a real buzz in the area.
"We're extremely happy with how Selkirk MTB Marathon went at the weekend, " he said.
"The riders enjoyed the fantastic trails we have in the Borders, both natural and man-made, though it's fair to say a few of them were pretty shattered by the end of their rides. Most even got round in the dry.
"The presence of the British Championships brought an extra buzz to the event, as 'regular' riders got to line up against stars from the Commonwealth Games and elsewhere - seeing Scots on the podiums was particularly pleasing."
