Cabins blown off lorry removed from M8 in Glasgow

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Two portable cabins blown off a lorry on the westbound M8 in Glasgow have been removed from the carriageway.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The incident, near Hillington, happened soon after 10:00 in heavy rain and high winds.
It resulted in the carriageway being closed for a short time with traffic being diverted off and back on at the J26 slip roads.
Traffic Scotland said all lanes were now open but traffic was slow moving and drivers should expect delays.
