The 39-year-old Ukrainian - the WBA, WBO and IBF champion - will enter a 19th defence in Dusseldorf.
"I would have to allow someone to beat me, but I won't allow that because my ego is my protection," said Klitschko.

"The person who can beat me is myself. If I'm 100% focused, then the only person who can beat me is myself."
Klitschko is in his second world title reign, having regained the IBF version of the belt in April 2006.
He says his decade at the top of the heavyweight division has been fuelled by his ego.
"This probably sounds selfish, but I have a very big ego," said Klitschko, whose brother Vitali was also a world heavyweight champion. "It's not about somebody else - it is about my own satisfaction and my own ego that needs to be satisfied.
"My ego is big and it gives me the motivation. My ego says I have been champion for a long time.
"I think that's the core of any successful person - ego. I wouldn't say to put ego in a negative box. I think it's controlled ego - it's big and that's probably the core of your motivation."
