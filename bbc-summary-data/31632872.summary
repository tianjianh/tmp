[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Whoever is elected in the general election must be held to account on mental health issues, says the government's care minister.

Norman Lamb was being questioned by 26-year-old Newsbeat listener Annabelle Harris who is recovering from an eating disorder.
She started to develop the disorder from the age of 10 but it wasn't picked up until three years later.
After Annabelle told Newsbeat her story we took her to meet Norman Lamb.
She asked him some key questions about his plans on helping people.
The Liberal Democrat MP has pledged Â£150 million over the next five years in improving services, reducing waiting times and supporting families.
The idea is we introduce access waiting time standard so you know that you'll access support within a defined period of time.
Critically it has to be access to an evidence based service that will work - such as places like Slam in London.
It seems to me that they have a really impressive service, there is rapid intervention and it's community based.
Critically, it involves getting access to specialist support really quickly and results show that they achieve recovery much more quickly.
That's the approach I want to take but I just want it mainstreamed, it should be available everywhere but it takes time to build the capacity in the system.
We've made the judgement there is an overwhelming moral and economic imperative to invest in mental health across the board.
Will other parties do it? Well I just think we have to all hold whoever's elected to account on this.
I think we've got to that point in our history where mental health's time has come.
There's a growing understanding and recognition of the complete false economy in thinking you can trim back on mental health and no one will notice.
There is loads of evidence that if you invest in mental health you'll make further savings down the track and you can make a massive difference to people's lives
I think it is.
NHS England is leading on this - we've set the standard, we've got the money and the investment is there to do it.
We expect that standard to be met by April 2016 which includes six week standard to access psychological therapies for anxiety, depression and other mental health conditions.
But another critical standard is to access treatment within two weeks if you have first episode for psychosis which again has a massive impact on young people.
Labour says it will end the "scandalous'" neglect of mental health services if Labour takes power in May's General Election.
Ed Miliband says he wants his party to raise budgets for children's mental health services, expanding early intervention work and widening access to school-based therapy.
