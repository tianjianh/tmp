York motorists in fines warning over Coppergate

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Drivers who use a city centre street illegally will face fixed penalty notices as a council attempts to ease congestion in York.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
An automatic number plate recognition system is being installed on Coppergate at a cost of Â£75,000.
City of York Council said it is also limiting the hours private vehicles can use the road.
The scheme, which begins on 1 August, is being funded by the Department for Transport's Better Bus Area fund.
The Labour-run council said traffic enforcement restrictions had been in place on Coppergate since the 1960s, but only enforced infrequently.
The authority said on a recent enforcement day more than 600 motorists were seen using the street when they were not supposed to.
Councillor Dave Merrett, cabinet member for transport, said: "By reducing both the volume of illicit vehicles using Coppergate during the day, and avoiding loading during peak hours, we will help buses, taxis and cyclists get through this extremely narrow road much more easily."
Only buses, cyclists and taxis will be permitted to use the road between 07:00 and 19:00 and delivery vans will only be permitted to load or unload between 10:00 and 16:00.
