Harry Peak was pictured dressed in a Three Lions training kit when he invaded the pitch at St George's Park in Staffordshire.
The 18-year-old said it was "a moment of frustration" as he had failed to find players to sign a shirt earlier.
The Football Association said his behaviour was "unacceptable".
The governing body added that it was considering "appropriate action", but declined to comment further.
Mr Peak, of Tavistock, in Devon, had been invited to watch yesterday's training session with his father, a Club Wembley member.
After running on to the pitch, he was seen kicking a ball before England's team physiotherapist Gary Lewin ushered him away from the players.
It was the first time the team had gathered to train since the final Euro 2016 squad was revealed.
The teenager, who is currently studying for A-levels, said he had spent nine hours travelling to the training centre in the hope of getting autographs.
"We were left waiting for around three hours and then when we got to watch the players we were informed there wouldn't be any autographs or photos after the training," he said.
"I was absolutely gutted. It was a frustrated spur of the moment decision. I had a rush of adrenaline, I ran on the pitch as I thought it was the only time I'd get to meet the players."
He added: "I'm not a prankster. It wasn't a prank and I am embarrassed at the problems I have caused."
An FA spokesman said: "The person in question was the son of an invited Club Wembley member who had to follow a formal registration process on entry to St George's Park.
"The FA were aware of his identity and we will take the appropriate action in due course as a result of this unacceptable behaviour."
