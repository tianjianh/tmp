Liverpool captain Jordan Henderson has 'no chance' of featuring in the England squad when it is named next week, says Reds manager Jurgen Klopp.

Henderson, 26, has missed the last three games with a foot injury and will miss Sunday's trip to Manchester City.
"The international break, these two weeks, can bring him back, but there's no game possible," said Klopp.
"He cannot train. Hopefully he can run in the second week of the international break and then we have to see."
England manager Gareth Southgate is due to name his squad on Thursday for a friendly with Germany on 22 March and a World Cup qualifier against Lithuania four days later.
Henderson has won 32 caps and played every minute of Southgate's four games in charge so far.
Tottenham striker Harry Kane is also likely to miss out after injuring his ankle against Millwall on Sunday, while England captain Wayne Rooney has been ruled out of Manchester United's trip to Chelsea on Monday with a leg injury.
And Arsenal midfielder Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain lasted less than half-an-hour of the FA Cup win over Lincoln before injuring his hamstring.
