Cat loses claws in homemade snare in Edinburgh

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An investigation has been launched after a cat was injured in a homemade snare in Edinburgh.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The cat lost three claws and suffered abrasions to his face, tongue and paws.
The snare was untagged and non-locking, both of which constitute offences under the Snares (Scotland) Order 2010.
Scotland's animal welfare charity was called to investigate after the cat returned home to Drum Brae Crescent on 11 May.
A Scottish SPCA spokesman said: "Snares are generally designed for rabbits, foxes and hares. However, in this environment it is likely this snare was set intentionally for cats.
"Our enquiries so far have not resulted in any leads and we are now urging anyone with information about this incident or other cases of illegal snaring to contact our Animal Helpline on 03000 999 999."
