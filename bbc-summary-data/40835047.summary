Notts County 2-0 Chesterfield

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Two stunning goals from substitute Jorge Grant earned Notts County their first win of the season as they secured victory over 10-man Chesterfield.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
After a forgettable opening 25 minutes, the game burst into life on the back of an off-the-ball incident involving Gozie Ugwu and Elliott Hewitt, for which the former earned a yellow card.
County immediately went on the attack, with Sam Hird denying Shola Ameobi with a fine tackle before he hacked Terry Hawkridge's effort off the line.
But the visitors then suffered a setback just before the break when Scott Wiseman saw red for a needless shove on Hawkridge.
The challenge facing County was to overcome Chesterfield's stubbornness and they did just that when loanee Grant looped a fantastic header over Anyon in the 60th minute.
The 22-year-old saved his best for last in injury time when Hird was penalised for a foul on Jonathan Forte 25 yards from goal.
Grant took responsibility with the set-piece and bent it over the wall and into the far corner to give Anyon no chance.
