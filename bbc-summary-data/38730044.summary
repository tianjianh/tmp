[SN]TITLE[SN]
Funding for Lochaber arts project Room 13 International

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An arts initiative in Lochaber has been awarded a grant of almost Â£50,000 to expand the work it does with young people.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Room 13 International started at Caol Primary School in Caol, near Fort William, more than 20 years ago.
At that time a group of pupils set up their own studio so they could work with artists on projects such as painting and photography.
There are now more than 80 studios based on the same model worldwide.
The grant from Young Start Fund will help roll out the project to more schools in Lochaber.
