007 star Daniel Craig has said he would only do another Bond movie "for the money".

Craig, who reprises the role of the secret agent in his fourth Bond movie, Spectre, this November, told Time Out magazine he wanted to "move on".
"I'm over it at the moment. We're done. All I want to do is move on," he said.
"For at least a year or two, I just don't want to think about it," said the 47-year-old. "If I did another Bond movie, it would only be for the money."
Craig first stepped into the role in the 2006 film Casino Royale, and his acclaimed performance was widely credited with reinvigorating the franchise.
'Step up'
The latest film reunites the star with director Sam Mendes, with whom he made 2012's Skyfall - the highest-grossing Bond film of all time.
However, when asked if he wanted to make another Bond movie, Craig told Time Out magazine: "Now? I'd rather break this glass and slash my wrists. No, not at the moment. Not at all."
"I don't know what the next step is. I've no idea," he added, speculating on his future.
"At the moment, we've done it. I'm not in discussion with anybody about anything."
There has been widespread speculation about who might take over from Craig in the role - with Luther star Idris Elba, Tom Hiddleston and Damian Lewis among the potential contenders, according to bookmakers and the press.
Craig's advice to any potential successor was to "step up".
"Don't listen to anybody else. Well, do listen to everybody, but you have to make the choice at the end of the day. It's your bed to lie on."
"You've got to step up. People do not make movies like this any more. This is really rare now."
