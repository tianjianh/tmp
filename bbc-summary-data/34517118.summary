Emergency services found 55-year-old David McKenna unresponsive at a ground floor flat in Finch Close, Barnet.
He was pronounced dead at 06:51 BST. Next of kin have been informed.
No one else was injured.
A post-mortem is taking place at Northwick Park Hospital.
Det Ch Insp Andy Chalmers of the Homicide and Major Crime Command said he would like to speak to those who spotted anyone acting suspiciously in the vicinity of Finch Close on Sunday night or Monday morning.
"Thankfully, due to the actions of the London Fire Brigade, the blaze did not spread to other homes. Had it done so, we could be investigating more deaths.
"We retain an open mind as to the possible motive for the murder."
No arrests have yet been made.
