Keziah Flux-Edmonds was found unconscious on Wednesday at a house in Cromwell Avenue, East Cowes, alongside the body of Darren Flux-Edmonds, 44.
She was taken to St Mary's Hospital in Newport but died a short time later.
"Everyone's just in absolute shock, it's an absolute tragedy," said Isle of Wight Councillor Julia Baker-Smith, who lives nearby.
Hundreds of people gathered for an evening vigil on the newly-built housing estate. Flowers, toys and candles have been laid at the family home throughout the day.
Keziah was a pupil at the nearby Queensgate Primary School. Ms Baker-Smith said special arrangements were being made for when staff and pupils returned from the half-term holiday.
"It's going to be a very very sad day. But everything is being put in place to make sure people get the support they need."
Another resident said: "It's dreadful, we're all thinking of the family."
Dozens of people have also posted about the deaths on social networking site Facebook.
One post reads: "So sad, thoughts with family and friends at this very sad time."
Hampshire Constabulary said they did not believe there was a wider risk to the community.
The force said specialist officers were supporting the family and investigations into the exact circumstances of the deaths were ongoing.
