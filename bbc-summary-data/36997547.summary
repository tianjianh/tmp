[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Police were called to an area of woodland on the south bank of the Water of Leith, near Dean Village, at about 03:30.
Officers said a "very large" tree had fallen as the two men slept.
One died at the scene and the other, aged 35, suffered minor injuries. Police said the tree fell due to "natural occurrences".
It is understood the men had been wild camping in the area.
A Police Scotland spokeswoman said: "Officers have consulted with the appropriate partners, who are confident that the tree fell as a result of natural occurrences.
"We're currently working to trace the deceased's next of kin, and a report will be submitted to the procurator fiscal."
