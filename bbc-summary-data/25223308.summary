Police were called to Boldon Colliery after reports that two boys had become unwell.
A 15-year-old boy was taken to South Tyneside General Hospital, where his condition is described as stable. Another boy, aged 16, was treated at the scene and is recovering at home.
Northumbria Police said the use of legal highs was "far from harmless" and will be visiting the area's schools.
The spokesman added: "These substances also often contain potentially dangerous chemicals which can prove fatal whichever way they are used so it's extremely important people avoid them. "
