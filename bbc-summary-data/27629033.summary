Bolton man given life animal ban after emaciated dog find

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man has been banned from keeping animals after being convicted of a series of cruelty charges relating to a severely emaciated dog.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
David Lowe, 33, of no fixed address, was given a 12 week suspended sentence after his case was heard at Bolton Magistrates' Court in his absence.
He faced five charges including failing to take the Lurcher to the vets and failing to address its weight loss.
Lowe's defence said he was suffering from depression.
The court heard he had been given 15-year-old Fly by his ex-partner along with Â£20 so he could take her to the vets to be put down.
Lowe had been looking after the dog for two weeks when she was discovered by the RSPCA following a tip-off in October last year.
The defence claimed he "didn't have it in him" to take her to the vets because "it was easier said than done" and he "hoped she'd die of natural causes".
A petition with more than 30,000 signatures was handed to the court by Justice For Fly campaigners in a bid for Lowe to be given the maximum sentence.
RSPCA Inspector Vicky McDonald said: "It was a good outcome... and also we've secured a lifetime ban and he can't appeal for 25 years."
Fly was put to sleep by vets.
