Cloud accounting software firm FreeAgent has raised £10.7m from investors after floating on London's Alternative Investment Market (AIM).

Its initial public offering (IPO) valued the Edinburgh-based company at more than £34m.
It is thought to be the first time a UK company has gone to IPO after raising money through equity crowdfunding.
Last year, it raised more than £1m through the crowdfunding platform Seedrs.
FreeAgent is an online bookkeeping and accounting system targeted at micro-businesses.
It was founded nine years ago by three people, and now employs more than 100 full-time staff.
Chief executive and co-founder Ed Molyneux said: "We are very pleased to have today been admitted to trading on AIM - this is a transformational event for FreeAgent.
"Our entry to the AIM market is a positive step that marks the next phase of FreeAgent's development as we progress our growth strategy.
"We look forward to our future as a quoted company with confidence."
