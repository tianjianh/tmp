Margaret Phillips, who revealed eating hot curries as her secret to a long life, won the Scottish Curry Award's 2016 prize after public nominations.
The great-grandmother, who discovered her love of the spicy dish during 15 years spent living in India, beat seven other nominees to the award.
A thank-you video filmed by her grandson was shown at the ceremony.
Mrs Phillips, a resident at Balcarres Care Home in Broughty Ferry, was born in Dundee in 1912 and lived in India during two spells in the 1930s and 1940s.
She told BBC Scotland that her grandparents had also liked the dish, and that she had no preference between the curries she ate in India and those from her hometown.
Mrs Phillips' daughter, Jacqueline, said: "She certainly makes a mean curry and, before she moved to Balcarres, she was famous within the family for curry suppers, which she would hold on a regular basis.
"We would like to thank everyone who voted for her. It's a very special achievement and the whole family is incredibly proud of her."
The care home will host a celebratory curry night this week which will include including Mrs Phillips' favourite prawn madras.
Its manager Lynn McLean, said staff and residents were "absolutely delighted" at news of the award.
She said: "As she is turning 104 this summer, she is unfortunately unable to get out and about as much as she used to, so wasn't able to attend the ceremony.
"But we think the curry night will be a fantastic alternative, and something a little bit different for all the residents to enjoy.
"Margaret is such a pleasure to be around and very popular with everyone who lives and works here."
