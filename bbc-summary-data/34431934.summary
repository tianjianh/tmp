[SN]TITLE[SN]
Ex-Brazil President Lula to be questioned in Petrobras case

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Brazilian officials investigating a corruption scandal at the state-run oil company Petrobras will be allowed to question ex-President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, the supreme court has ruled.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
It said Lula would be heard as a witness and was not being investigated.
Police say they want to see if he benefited from the Petrobras scheme. Other members of the governing Workers' Party will be questioned.
Prosecutors say firms bribed Petrobras executives to secure contracts.
Some of the money was then passed on to Workers' Party politicians.
The scandal is the largest in Brazil's history, with top politicians accused of taking bribes.
Among those arrested in connection are Mr Lula's former chief of staff Joss Dirceu and the former Workers' Party treasurer Joao Vaccari.
But Mr Lula's successor as Brazilian leader, Dilma Rousseff, who chaired Petrobras when much of the corruption is believed to have taken place, has been cleared of involvement.
