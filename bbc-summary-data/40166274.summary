The 29-year-old joined from St Helens in 2015 and has featured 16 times this term for a side currently second.
Flanagan was also named vice-captain of Ian Watson's side for 2017.
"His form would have attracted interest from elsewhere but he's a really important part of what we do," said head coach Watson.
"He is one out main leaders, he's uncompromising in defence and he's a really good ball-playing loose forward. He's part of the glue that holds this team together."
