The Shrimpers were initially on top, going ahead on 15 minutes when Jermaine McGlashan played in Marc-Antoine Fortune, who rounded the advancing Conrad Logan before tapping home.
Dale then had centre-back Keith Keane sent off seven minutes later for bringing down Fortune when he was clean through on goal.
Southend midfielder Anthony Wordsworth slammed the resulting free-kick against the crossbar before the Shrimpers were also reduced to 10 men on 34 minutes when McGlashan was shown a second yellow card after bringing down Ian Henderson.
Rochdale improved after the break, Calvin Andrew wasting two headers before Jamie Allen's long-range shot was saved by Ted Smith.
Dale equalised in the 66th minute when Andrew cut in off the right-hand side and netted with a deflected left-footed shot which looped into the top left-hand corner.
But Southend struck back to secure all three points when Cox netted a brilliant left-footed shot from eight yards.
