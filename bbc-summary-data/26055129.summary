Austria's Julia Dujmovits won women's gold by retrieving 0.72 seconds from run one against German Anke Karstens.Benjamin Karl of Austria and German Amelie Kober each took bronze.
Kober, 26, saw off Italy's Corinna Boccacini to add to the silver she took in giant slalom at Turin in 2006, while Karl eased to third when Italian Aaron March slipped in their bronze medal race.
It was the first time parallel slalom had featured as an Olympic sport and Karl, 28, looked set to cause an upset when he took a 1.12 second lead over Wild after run one of their semi-final.
But United States-born Wild, who became a Russian citizen in 2011, astonishingly overhauled the difference on the second run to set up a final against his training partner Kosir.
A vociferous home crowd roared him to victory, three days after both he and his wife - fellow snowboarder Alena Zavarzina - won Olympic medals within the space of 10 minutes of each other.
