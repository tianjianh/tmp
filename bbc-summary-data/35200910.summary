Some panels landed on the fourth storey of John Lewis and others on Station Street, which police then shut.
No-one was hurt and there was no damage to property on the street below the department store, a West Midlands Fire Service spokeswoman said.
A spokesman for Grand Central said "adverse weather conditions" meant the tiles had become loose.

Dave Ladkin photographed workers at the top of the building shortly after the panels came off and questioned whether strong winds or poor construction was to blame.
Grand Central shopping centre sits above New Street Station and opened in September, several days after passengers began using the redesigned railway concourse.
It cost about Â£750m to redesign the railway station and construct the shopping complex in place of the old Pallasades Centre.
In a statement, Grand Central said: "Due to recent adverse weather conditions, a small number of tiles from the roof of Grand Central Birmingham became loose.
"Although no-one was hurt, for precautionary measures, Station Road was temporarily closed while contractors on-site made safe the area to ensure that no further damage occurs."
