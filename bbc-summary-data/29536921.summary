The Mindsweep will be released on 19 January next year.
They recorded the album at the Chapel Studios in Lincolnshire earlier this year with Dan Weller producing.
The album's 12 tracks were mixed by Jeremy Wheatley - who's behind the likes of The Vaccines, Dizzee Rascal, Sugababes and Bon Jovi - in London.
Enter Shikari's last full-length album, A Flash Flood Of Colour, was released in 2012 peaking at number four in the Official Album Chart.
Frontman Rou Reynolds said: "We pushed ourselves vocally with some of the rawest angriest vocals we've ever done as well as some of the most dulcet and delicate.
"It's even more diverse than normal as we've built more confidence and fearlessness to widen our influences further.
"Melody and aggression will always be an important side of what we do, but with this album there was also a concerted effort to concentrate on texture too.
"Alongside the core of our guitar, bass, drums, electronics set-up, there's so much new instrumentation and orchestration.
"Writing for and recording woodwind, brass and strings was so rewarding and really felt like it brought a new dimension to the music.
"We just can't wait to play these songs live now."
The band will also play across Europe in January and February.
