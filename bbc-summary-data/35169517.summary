The driver suffered relatively minor injuries to his face and neck when the car came to rest on top of the 7ft (2.1m) high fence in Dudley.
The man, thought to be in his 50s, was lying across the front seats of the car when found. Fire crews had to stabilize it before he could be freed.
Ambulance staff said it was "remarkable" he was not more seriously hurt in the crash at about 08:30 GMT.
"Remarkably, the man, who remained conscious throughout, had escaped serious injuries but was treated for minor injuries to his face, neck pain and a suspected fractured collarbone," an ambulance spokesman said.
The fence was close to a scaffolding yard, so fire crews used equipment from there to get the car stable, a fire spokesman said.
