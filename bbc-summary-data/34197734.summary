[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Iraq Inquiry chairman Sir John Chilcot says he has received the last of the outstanding responses to his findings from those facing criticism.

This brings to an end the so-called "Maxwellisation" process that was partly causing the report's delay.
In a letter to the Foreign Affairs Committee, Sir John said he would write to David Cameron to set out a timetable for publication "as soon as I am able".
The PM's spokesman said Mr Cameron was keen to see it "as soon as possible".
In his letter, Sir John - who began his work in 2009 - said there was "inevitably, further work for my colleagues and I to do to evaluate those submissions, which are detailed and substantial, in order to establish with confidence the time needed to complete the inquiry's remaining work".
Conservative MP David Davis said Sir John's latest announcement was "mixed news".
He said it was "hard to see why it should take very much longer to conclude the report" and he added that he would have "expected a timetable within this calendar year and if not, why?".
