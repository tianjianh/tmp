West Stafford bypass flooding repairs 'urgent'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Solutions to prevent flooding on a road closed several times after heavy rain are being "urgently" sought.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Dorset County Council hopes a proposal will be in place for West Stafford bypass between Dorchester and Crossways by the spring.
It said there was a "clear need" to find a solution.
The road was built 20 years ago but high ground water levels and surface water and silt from neighbouring land have made it increasingly flood prone.
Andy Canning, from the council, said the existing drainage was no longer working.
He added: "The county council is very aware of the problem at West Stafford.
"It is great news for local residents that a team has been appointed to work on options to stop future flooding.  I particularly welcome the commitment to solve this problem before next winter."
The council said it was also working with Natural England and the Environment Agency and speaking with local landowners.
