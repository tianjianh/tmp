Ground surveys and excavations are being carried out before construction work starts on the project.
Under the plans, new lighting, public art, paving and street furniture will be installed in the areas between the station and the Fruit Market.
Hull City Council said it expected the revamp to be completed in time for its role as City of Culture in 2017.
The first phase, which is costing £12.7m, would "maximise our city's unique character and heritage", the authority said.
It hopes to increase retail turnover by £70m and see 500 new jobs over the next 10 years.
Councillor Martin Mancey said: "This is the very first sign of work beginning on the ground.
"We have a huge amount of work to do to get the city ready for 2017 and I would ask businesses and residents for their patience whilst the work is under way.
"We will do everything possible to minimise disruption."
Building work on the transformation is expected to start in September.
