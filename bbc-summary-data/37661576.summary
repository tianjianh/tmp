Johanna Konta: British number one relying on other results for WTA Finals place

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
British number one Johanna Konta will have to rely on other players' results if she is to qualify for the WTA Finals for the first time.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Konta will not play on the tour next week having pulled out of this week's Hong Kong Open through injury.
The world number nine is in the eighth and final qualifying place for the event in Singapore from 23 October.
Slovakia's Dominika Cibulkova will overtake her if she beats Carla Suarez Navarro on Saturday.
The pair are competing in the last four of the WTA event in Linz, Austria.
If Cibulkova loses, she, along with her Spanish opponent Navarro and Russia's Svetlana Kuznetsova, would still have a chance to pass Konta next week.
The WTA events next week include the Kremlin Cup in Moscow and the Luxembourg Open, which both start on Monday.
An additional place could become available for the end-of-season event if Serena Williams, who is currently second in the race to qualify, withdraws having not played since the US Open.
Konta withdrew from the Hong Kong Open with an abdominal strain shortly before her second-round match against Wang Qiang.
