Police in India's northern Haryana state are investigating two brutal gang rapes which have shocked the country.

In the first, police say a woman of 23 was gang-raped and murdered last week in Rohtak district - it took days for her mutilated body to be found. A post mortem showed her "skull was broken".
On Saturday a 22-year-old was gang-raped in a moving car in the Delhi suburb of Gurgaon, police say.
Activists say both attacks show women continue to be unsafe in India.
Residents in Sonipat district, where the Rohtak victim's family lives, found the woman's decomposing body after they noticed stray dogs around it.
"We arrested two suspects the following day and they have confessed to the crime," superintendent of police Ashwin Shenvi told the BBC.
"The post mortem report shows that she was raped, and she died of head injuries."
The post mortem also showed she had been drugged before the attack. It is alleged at least one of the men knew her.
In Gurgaon, district commissioner of police Sumit Kumar said the young woman was abducted and then allegedly gang-raped in a moving car on Saturday night.
"No arrests have been made but we are following several leads, which we can't disclose to the media," he said.
Scrutiny of sexual violence in India has grown since the 2012 gang rape and murder of a student on a Delhi bus.
However, brutal sexual attacks against women and children continue to be reported across the country.
