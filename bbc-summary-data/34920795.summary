Derby boxer Sandy Ryan says the sacrifices she has had to make will be worth it if it makes her a champion.

Great Britain's Ryan will face Charlene Jones in the British Championships in Sheffield on Wednesday as she fights for the women's Lightweight title.
The 22-year-old told BBC Radio Derby: "You have to sacrifice a lot. You do think 'what if I lived a normal life?'
"I just say to myself 'suffer now and live the rest of your life a champion', that's what Muhammad Ali said."
Ryan, who is hoping to represent Great Britain at next year's Olympic Games in Rio, won a bronze medal at the European Games in Baku earlier this year.
The Derby boxer has already beaten her Welsh opponent twice, but Ryan is taking nothing for granted against Jones.
"She's very game. She will keep coming forward but I am looking to get the third win," Ryan added.
"I look back at videos with the coaches. Just because you've had a win against someone, you can't take it for granted.
"They could come with another game plan, so you have to be prepared."
