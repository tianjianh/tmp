£5m heroin gang accused 'kept drugs in speaker'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Six people accused of being involved in Wales' largest heroin seizure kept the drugs in a speaker, a court has heard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Shazia Ahmad and Wasim Ali, from Newport, Umar Arif, Umar Butt and Khalid Yassen, from Cardiff, and Zawed Malik from Greater Manchester, all deny conspiracy to supply the class A drug.
Cardiff Crown Court heard two cars were followed by undercover police officers.
Almost 40kg (88lbs) of heroin worth about £5m was seized between 2013 and 2014.
The jury was told the speaker was being carried in a car that was stopped by police.
Mr Butt and Mr Yassen were arrested on the M5 with 36.5kg of heroin in a speaker and suitcase in their Citroen Picasso.
Undercover officers said they followed the Picasso and a Fiat Punto "travelling in convoy" but admitted under cross examination that they did not see a "speaker box" being placed in the Picasso.
The court heard money was handed over at locations across Newport, including a Lidl car park.
The case continues.
