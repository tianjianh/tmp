Kate met dignitaries and was walked round the show at the National Portrait Gallery, of which she is a patron.
St James's Palace has confirmed the duchess has also agreed to pose for a portrait for the gallery.
Prince William is currently deployed in the Falkland Islands as an RAF Search and Rescue co-pilot.
The duchess was taken around the exhibition - part of the countdown to the London 2012 Festival - by gallery director Sandy Nairne and exhibition curator Sarah Howgate.
Freud, one of Britain's most distinguished and highly-regarded artists, died last year at the age of 88.
Mr Nairne said: "The duchess was extremely attentive and I think really interested in not just the chance to see the full range of Lucian Freud's work but very interested to see the differences in technique.

"Because the early work is very fine in particular and then of course the work changes and becomes much more painterly."
Kate has a history of art degree from the University of St Andrews, where she and William met in 2001.
