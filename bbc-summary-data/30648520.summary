West Midlands Ambulance Service had been bracing itself for record numbers of call-outs after experiencing one of its busiest ever days during December.
However, the number of overnight calls received on New Year's Eve was 1,436 - far fewer than last year's figure of around 1,600.
The service said the public was heeding advice not to make non-emergency calls.
A sharp rise in calls throughout 2014 had led the service to expect an extremely busy New Year's Eve and it had warned it was "stretched to the limit".
However, chief executive Anthony Marsh said "months of planning" had meant the service was able to cope.
"I cannot remember a year like 2014. Demand just kept increasing with more pressure in the system that I can recall for a very long time," he said.
"Staff on the road and in our control rooms have been working flat out during December which saw the trust break records in terms of demand.
"I am immensely proud of the way that, as a trust, we have met this challenge."
