Margot Kidder, who starred alongside Christopher Reeve in the original films, found her ancestors were farmers in Llanigon in the early 1850s.
She has been searching records in Brecon Library to try to glean more about their history.
Ms Kidder has learned they emigrated to New York from Liverpool in 1854.
Ms Kidder, who was born in Canada, used the 1851 Census for Llanigon to look specifically at Llwynllyrd and the Powell family name to check against those on the ship's manifest.
Although she was not successful, she told staff she plans to return to the area to continue her research.
Branch librarian Susan Jones said Ms Kidder was a "lovely visitor" who was enthusiastic about her research.
Ms Jones said: "It is so exciting to watch people make the first steps to connect with their past.
"You never know where it might lead you or who you will meet on the way."
