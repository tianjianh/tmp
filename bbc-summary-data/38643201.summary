Stakeknife: Freddie Scappaticci facing at least 20 lawsuits

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A west Belfast man who denies being Britain's former top Army agent in the IRA is facing at least 20 lawsuits.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The agent, codenamed Stakeknife, has been named by the media as Freddie Scappaticci.
Mr Scappaticci has been accused of involvement in up to 50 murders during Northern Ireland's Troubles.
Police revealed details about the litigation against Mr Scappaticci in a bid to have lawsuits against him put on hold for two years.
Police said allowing the civil claims to continue could prejudice a criminal investigation.
But, a lawyer for one of those suing 69-year-old argued that it would be "catastrophic" to stay her action until December 2018.
Mr Scappaticci left Northern Ireland in 2003 after being identified by the media as Stakeknife.
Before quitting his home, he denied being the agent while in charge of the IRA's internal security team.
The judge confirmed that a total of 20 actions against Mr Scappaticci have either been lodged or are being prepared.
That figure could rise in future, he was told.
The judge adjourned the application.
