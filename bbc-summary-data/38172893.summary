Harry Potter and the Cursed Child is up for best play, while five of its cast members have also been shortlisted.
Glenn Close, Ralph Fiennes, Billie Piper and Sheridan Smith are among the other actors in contention for prizes.
The annual theatre awards, which are decided by a public vote, will be presented in London on 19 February.
Based on an original story by JK Rowling, Harry Potter and the Cursed Child has been a sold-out success since opening in June.
Last month the two-part production was named best play at the London Evening Standard Theatre Awards.
Its other nominations come for John Tiffany's direction and the design of its costumes, sets, lighting and video.
Half a Sixpence leads in the musicals categories with eight nominations, while Groundhog Day has seven.
There are also nominations for three actor knights - Sir Kenneth Branagh for The Entertainer, Sir Derek Jacobi for Romeo and Juliet, and Sir Ian McKellen for No Man's Land.
Hollywood star Close is shortlisted for her performance in Sunset Boulevard at the London Coliseum, while Smith is recognised for her turn in Funny Girl.
Fiennes and Piper are recognised for their widely acclaimed work in Richard III and Yerma respectively.
The full list of nominations is available on the WhatsOnStage website. Theatregoers have until 31 January to cast their votes.
