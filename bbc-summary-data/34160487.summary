"I thought we were fantastic - first and foremost I need to talk about Aiden; what a hat-trick. He's got the ability and quality to do that. It wasn't just his goals, his all-round performance was good.
"The back four were much better, much more aware of danger.
"I thought all over the park, I thought the subs that came on played their part, I thought we managed the game really well and that's the pleasing thing."
