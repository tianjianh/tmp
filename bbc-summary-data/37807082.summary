The National League Imps have exited at the first-round stage in each of the last three seasons but Raggett's first-half header and an effort from Alan Power after the break meant John Cyrus' late goal was no more than a consolation.
City were always the superior side and were desperately unlucky not to break the deadlock early on when Harry Anderson stole possession 25 yards from goal before thundering a first-time effort against the crossbar.
But the hosts didn't wait long to open the scoring as a pinpoint corner from Sam Habergham in the 21st-minute was headed home by Raggett from six yards.
Chance after chance fell to the Imps after the break as they searched for the killer second - Theo Robinson somehow heading wide from close-range after 55 minutes.
But they made no mistake on the hour mark as Nathan Arnold scampered through the middle before slipping in Power, who finished delightfully.
The National League North visitors, against the run of play, halved the deficit on 75 minutes when Cyrus rose above a static home defence to nod home a corner but it was too late.
