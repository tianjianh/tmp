Police were first alerted to the body, between junctions 16 and 17, just after 02:00 after receiving a number of calls from motorists.
They said Mr Hayes suffered "catastrophic" injuries on a 50mph stretch of the road near Watford Gap services.
Mr Hopkins said Mr Hayes may have been in the Toddington Services area, in Bedfordshire, at about 01:30.
"He may have been given a lift from there, or may have hidden himself in a lorry, to enable him to get to where we discovered him," Mr Hopkins said.
"This may have been an accident or something more serious. We need to determine the circumstances that led to his death."
