Crawley were unable to trouble Orient in a poor first half, which saw them fail to produce a single shot.
Gnanduillet gave Orient the lead before the break when he chested the ball and turned before volleying into the net.
The former Chesterfield striker worked a second when he stabbed home Sean Clohessy's cross at the far post.
The win lifted Orient into the League Two play-off places and a point clear of AFC Wimbledon in seventh, while Crawley stay 17th.
Leyton Orient player-manager Kevin Nolan told BBC Radio London:

"I asked for a performance and I think I got it today.
"I'm absolutely delighted with the way we've responded to the two defeats that we've suffered in the last two home games with a good performance today.
"We kept at it and that was the most pleasing thing."
Crawley Town boss Mark Yates told BBC Surrey:

"I thought we were pretty pathetic to be honest, because we didn't show any desire, or any hunger. We were just content with giving the ball away and having to defend it.
"We didn't show any bottle to get onto the ball and support our strikers and we didn't have bottle to give quality into our strikers.
"I am not going to rant and rave because the players know I am not happy but I can't keep talking about it. The good thing is we've got a game Tuesday to get out of the way. We have to analyse quickly and see where we went wrong."
