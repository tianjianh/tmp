A Cardiff baby who was the UK's youngest organ donor has inspired more than 15,000 people to sign up to the NHS donors register, doctors say.

Surgeons at the University Hospital of Wales, Cardiff, carried out the pioneering operation minutes after Teddy Houlston, who lived for less than two hours, died in April last year.
His kidneys were then used to save an adult's life in Leeds.
Teddy's story has now inspired thousands to register as organ donors.
Dr Paul Murphy, national clinical lead for organ donation at NHS Blood and Transplant said: "In just a few days, thousands of people up and down the country have been inspired by Teddy's story and joined the organ donor register.
"We all knew that the Daily Mirror's 'Sign up for Teddy' campaign would make a huge difference to organ donation in the UK, but none of us could have predicted just how big an impact the campaign would have."
Teddy's parents, Mike Houlston and Jess Evans, from Cardiff, said they wanted people to know their son's story, adding: "We are so proud of him".
Ms Evans was carrying twins when she was told 12 weeks into her pregnancy that one was fatally ill.
Teddy had anencephaly, a rare and lethal abnormality which prevents the brain and skull from developing.
Babies with the condition either die in the womb, are stillborn or live for just seconds, minutes or hours after birth.
