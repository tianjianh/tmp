The victim, named locally as Quamari Barnes, was attacked near his school in Kensal Green in north-west London on Monday afternoon.
The Met has yet to confirm his identity but said next of kin had been informed.
A teenage boy, also aged 15, was arrested on suspicion of murder on Tuesday afternoon. He is still being questioned at a north London station.
Emergency services were called to Doyles Garden at 15:30 GMT on Monday.
Paramedics treated Quamari at the scene but he was later pronounced dead in hospital.
Tributes have been left outside his school, Capital City Academy, since the attack.
BBC London's Jonathan Savage said candles were still burning for the teenager on Wednesday.
"The 15-year-old was described by one friend as one of the most bubbly and energetic people you could meet," he said.
Quamari's aunt Sylvia Tella said: "A young life was cut brutally short outside of school.
"He was not a bad boy. That's always the excuse, 'oh he was involved with drugs or he was involved with guns or he was part of a gang'. This one wasn't. This one was a good boy. This one was a credit to his family."
Det Ch Insp Mark Lawson thanked witnesses who have spoken to detectives already and urged others to come forward.
"Whilst establishing the motive is a key part of our investigation, at this stage we do not believe that the murder was linked to gang activity or membership," he added.
