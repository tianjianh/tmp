A referee who sent an "offensive" tweet to a relative of a Hillsborough victim has been suspended for eight weeks and fined Â£100 by the Football Association.

Lower league referee Craig Langton posted the tweet, which related to the 1989 disaster, on 4 April in reply to a post by Charlotte Hennessy.
Her father, Jimmy, was one of the 96 supporters who died at Hillsborough.
An apology was posted by Mr Langton, who is also a firefighter, on his local Fire Brigades Union's Facebook page.
The FA's report into the incident said Ms Hennessy had tweeted indicating someone was selling tickets to a free Hillsborough memorial service.
Mr Langton, from Nottinghamshire, replied: "typical scousers and you want us to believe your innocent in all this. #Blamethepolice'."
The FA said the exchange of messages took place while the ongoing Hillsborough inquests had reached a "very sensitive part of the proceedings, especially relating to the police evidence".
The report states Mr Langton accepted he made a "huge mistake" and that his tweet was "badly worded".
It continues: "That said, he did not seem to show any real understanding of the offence/distress he had clearly caused by his tweet."
He admitted misconduct, with the report stating he had "little choice" due to screen shots existing of the "deemed to be offensive" comments.
Mr Langton, who has been in the fire service for 26 years, was listed as a referee for an FA Cup extra preliminary round this season.
Ms Hennessy said: "I'm satisfied that the FA recognised how offensive his tweet was, I do feel like they have dealt with it appropriately.
"I'm just disappointed that, even within all of these disciplinary hearings he has had to go to, he still doesn't see the severity or the offence that his tweet caused."
