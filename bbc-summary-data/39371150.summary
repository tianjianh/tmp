[SN]TITLE[SN]
Argoed inquest: Matthew Williams 'had cardiac arrest'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A prison leaver suffered a cardiac arrest after being found killing a woman at a Caerphilly county hostel, an inquest has heard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Matthew Williams attacked Cerys Yemm, 22, at the Sirhowy Arms Hotel, Argoed, on 6 November 2014.
Williams, 34, died after he was Tasered four times by police who arrested him.
Gwent Coroner's Court in Newport heard on Thursday that Tasers were not thought to have caused his cardiac arrest.
Two consultant cardiologists, in statements, said it was induced by amphetamines Williams used along with stress caused by the attack on Miss Yemm, the struggle with police and undiagnosed relapsed schizophrenia.
Consultant pathologist Dr Stephen Leadbeatter, who carried out his post mortem examination, told the inquest the barbs from the first Taser had struck Williams on his nose and chest.
The jury was told there were 17 "slash type" cuts on his left arm and on his neck caused by a sharp object which could have been self-inflicted.
Dr Leadbeatter said wounds on his hand suggested he could have been holding a sharp object, like a ceramic bowl.
He gave Williams' cause of death as "sudden unexpected death following a struggle against restraint including discharge of a Taser in a man with a history of schizophrenia who had taken amphetamine and cannabis".
The inquest continues.
