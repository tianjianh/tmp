Here are some of the sophisticated, brazen or audacious methods thieves have used to relieve the rich, famous - and the ordinary jewellery stores - of their stones.
A gang of "brazen burglars" raided the Hatton Garden Safe Deposit Ltd and stole jewellery and cash worth £14m.
The heist, which has become known as the "largest burglary in English legal history", occurred over Easter weekend in 2015.
During the raid, the gang used heavy cutting equipment to get into a vault and ransack 56 safe deposit boxes.
Seven men have been convicted.
An armed man stole jewels worth about 40m euros ($53m; £34m) in the French Riviera resort of Cannes in 2013.
The robbery took place on a Sunday morning during a jewellery exhibition at the Carlton Hotel.
The hotel is located on the Croisette promenade - one of the most prestigious locations in the town.
The theft was the largest in a series of high-profile robberies in Cannes.
The Carlton Hotel is where Alfred Hitchcock filmed To Catch A Thief - his 1955 film about a jewel thief operating in the French Riviera.
Between 2008 and 2009, a group of teenagers went on a theft rampage, stealing jewellery and designer goods belonging to celebrities in Hollywood.
The stolen items were valued at more than $3m.
The homes of Paris Hilton, Lindsey Lohan, Orlando Bloom, Audrina Patridge and others were burgled by the group who were known as the "Bling Ring".
According to police, the teenagers were motivated by celebrity worship and had a taste for luxury brands. They were arrested by police in 2009.
Their exploits formed the basis of the movie, The Bling Ring, starring Emma Watson.
Axe- and bat-wielding robbers rode their motorbikes into an indoor shopping centre and raided a jewellery store in London in November 2012.
Six people on three bikes raided Fraser Hart in Brent Cross Shopping Centre in north London.
The raid happened 15 minutes after the centre had opened to shoppers for the day.
The pillion passengers got off the bikes and smashed the windows, leaving with jewellery. The haul was thought to be worth up to £2m.
A cat burglar entered Spider-Man star Willem Dafoe's home in Rome and stole goods including jewellery in 2011.
While Italian reports valued the missing goods at $4,200, Dafoe's representative said it was $3,000.
The actor and his wife were not home at the time. The thief was said to have used ropes and mountain-climbing gear to get into the apartment from the roof.
Willem Dafoe once portrayed the archenemy of Spider-Man, the Green Goblin.
