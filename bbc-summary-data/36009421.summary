Jack Adcock death: Mother criticises 'shocking' report findings

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The mother of a boy who died after being "seriously neglected" in hospital has called the findings of a report into the place her son died "shocking".

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Jack Adcock, six, died of a cardiac arrest at Leicester Royal Infirmary after he developed sepsis in 2011.
Sepsis management was one of several concerns raised by health inspectors.
Doctor Hadiza Bawa-Garba and nurse Isabel Amaro were convicted of manslaughter by gross negligence last year at Nottingham Crown Court.
Jack, who had Down's syndrome and a heart condition, was admitted to the hospital with vomiting and diarrhoea. He died 11 hours later from a cardiac arrest caused by sepsis triggered by pneumonia.
A trial heard the boy's death was caused by "serious neglect" by staff who failed to recognise his body was "shutting down" and close to death.
Now a Care Quality Commission (CQC) report into the hospital's emergency department, published on 7 April, has found sepsis clinical pathways were in place, but were not always completed for patients despite evidence of escalating "early warning scores".
Inspectors reported two incidents of staff failing to recognise sepsis or the severity of the condition. In one instance, there was a misdiagnosis of sepsis by a junior doctor of a patient who had a blood clot in a leg which had travelled to a lung.
The report also found patients arriving on ambulances were not handed over in a "timely manner", and the "skill mix" of nursing staff was not always appropriate to meet patient needs.
Jack's mother, Nicola Adcock, from Glen Parva, Leicestershire, said she was previously given assurances procedures were being put in place to tackle problems with sepsis care at the hospital.
"It's disgusting, it's shocking, it should never happen," she said. "I've heard so many stories since Jack, so are they putting things in? Why are they not being adhered to?
"Nobody will ever understand what we've gone through."
Speaking on behalf of Leicester Royal Infirmary, chief nurse Julie Smith said on Friday that it was "completely accepted" at the time of the inspection that the hospital must do better.
She said the hospital now reports back to the CQC every week over sepsis care.
The CQC said it served a notice imposing conditions on the registration of the University Hospitals of Leicester NHS Trust - which runs the hospital - after the inspection.
