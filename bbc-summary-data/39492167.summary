Two hundred art house cinemas across the United States are screening an adaption of 1984 on Tuesday in protest against Donald Trump's administration.

The United State of Cinema website says George Orwell's dystopian fiction has "never been timelier".
Sales of the novel went up 9,500% after Mr Trump's inauguration.
Organisers say the national screening day is a stand against the "simple truth that there are no such things as 'alternative facts'".
It says: "By doing what they do best - showing a movie - the goal is that cinemas can initiate a much-needed community conversation at a time when the existence of facts, and basic human rights are under attack."
The term "alternative facts" was coined by Donald Trump aide Kellyanne Conway to explain discrepancies between accounts of crowd sizes at the presidential inauguration.
A key part of Orwell's book is the way that the government warps reality for its citizens.
The novel begins with the sentence: "It was a bright cold day in April, and the clocks were striking thirteen."
The organisers' website insists: "Less than one month into the new presidential administration, theatre owners collectively believe the clock is already striking thirteen."
The date was chosen as 4 April because that is when the novel's protagonist Winston Smith begins his rebellious diary.
Organisers say the screenings will take place in 184 US cities across 44 states, and a section of proceeds from events will be donated to local charities and community organisations.
