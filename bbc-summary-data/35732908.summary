Stephen Ward stretched to prod home the opener after Michael Keane headed down David Jones' corner.
Sam Vokes poked Burnley's second in off the post before Joe Lolley responded with a curled finish.
Ben Mee nodded in the visitors' third from a Jones corner, while Jason Davidson hit the bar for the Terriers.
Sean Dyche's Burnley have now taken 36 points from a possible 42 in a 14-game unbeaten league run, dating back to their loss at Hull City on 26 December.
Second-placed Middlesbrough, who had head coach Aitor Karanka walk out on training on Friday, can move back to within four points of the summit if they beat second-from-bottom Charlton Athletic at The Valley on Sunday.
Defeat leaves Huddersfield 18th in the table and six points above the relegation places.
Jones, returning from a Achilles problem which kept him out of Tuesday's win at Fulham, created the game's first goal - finding Keane to nod into the path of Republic of Ireland defender Ward, who netted his first league goal for the Clarets.
A neat touch from top scorer Andre Gray then afforded George Boyd space down the right-hand side, with Wales striker Vokes getting on the end of a piercing pass to net his 13th goal of the season from close range.
With Huddersfield's first shot on goal, Lolley - making his 50th Terriers appearance - reduced the deficit, only for Mee to restore the two-goal advantage almost immediately.
Huddersfield head coach David Wagner:
"Burnley are the best team in the league and if you are to beat the best team you have to be brave, and we weren't.
"At half-time I said we had to accept the situation. I said we can lose this game but we have to learn from the first half and impose our identity.
"If you play our style of football mistakes will happen but we are still creating chances. We made mistakes for the corners and were punished."
Burnley manager Sean Dyche:
"I felt we had control of the game at the end of the first half and we saw it out really well.
"In the second half Huddersfield played with more freedom, as you would expect from a side with nothing to lose, but we controlled it well.
"The energy of the side is great and we will physically go as hard as we can to get where we want to be.
"It was a very powerful performance and we never looked under pressure."
