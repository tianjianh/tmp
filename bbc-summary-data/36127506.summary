Cleveland Pools, near Bath, closed in 1978 and the site has since fallen into disrepair.
But a group is raising Â£5.2m to breathe life back into the 200-year-old site as a naturally-treated, heated, community-run open air swimming pool.
The plans include a separate heated children's pool, outdoor lounging areas and a pontoon for River Avon access.
Cleveland Pools Trust hopes to have fundraising and building work complete to welcome the first swimmers in Spring 2018.
Members of the group are inviting comments through an online survey as well as making themselves available to discuss the plans in Bath city centre on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday and Friday.
