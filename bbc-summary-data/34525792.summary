Price of Football: How much is the Women's Super League?

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Match-day admission for £3? Season tickets for £15? Attendances up by 48%?

Welcome to the Women's Super League.
The BBC's Price of Football analysed data from 227 clubs in 13 leagues across the UK to discover how much it costs supporters to follow their team.
And the WSL came out cheapest, with the average match-day ticket across both tiers costing less than £6.

The average prices in all four ticket categories we surveyed in WSL 1 have gone up, but the women's game as a whole worked out cheapest in our study.
No club in the top tier charges more than £7 for a game, while season tickets range between £30 and £48, with Manchester City at the top end - although this includes all league, cup and friendly games.
In WSL 2, the cheapest match-day ticket is at Aston Villa Ladies for £3 - and the most you will pay is £5.
The best value season tickets can be found at Yeovil Town Ladies and Reading Ladies for £15, while Durham Women and Doncaster Belles offer the top price at £35.

The top tier of the WSL has seen record attendances this season, with the average crowd up to 1,076 compared to 728 in 2014.
The profile of the women's game was given a major boost by England's success at this summer's World Cup in Canada, where they finished third, and attendances went up by 29% after the tournament.
"The sheer increase in attendances we've seen this season shows just what appetite there is for the women's game in this country," said FA director of football participation and development Kelly Simmons.
"There is so much fantastic work taking place at clubs to drive attendances and raise awareness and this success is testament to that."
