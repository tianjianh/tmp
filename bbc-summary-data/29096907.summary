Friday was dubbed Bill Murray Day by organisers, who put on free screenings of the star's films.
Murray himself was on hand to take part in events, including a special question-and-answer session for fans.
"I like to feel that every day is Bill Murray day. At least for a second every day," the star said. He is in town to promote his latest film, St Vincent.
It sees him play a cantankerous war veteran who finds himself having to look after his neighbour's 12-year-old son.
Speaking about Murray's special honour, co-star Melissa McCarthy said it was overdue.
"He's just kind of an amazing person and his body of work is so varied and so good - I think it's about time that we have a Bill Murray Day," she said.
Irish star Chris O'Dowd, who also stars in the film, joked about how he would be marking the occasion.
"Well we're going to sacrifice a goat at seven - that's probably the normal thing - and then just have a nice early night," he said.
"I think it's really great they said to him that today, and every 5 September, he can kill a man. They said he can kill just any one man, and the next day they're like, 'Don't worry about it'."
Murray told fans at the Q&A he was honoured to be recognised at the festival for his life's work.
"The only reason I've had the career I've had is someone told me some secrets early on about living - the more relaxed you are the better you are," he said.
Earlier, fans dressed up in costumes of Murray characters in honour of the star.
The actor picked out a baby in the crowd, who was dressed as the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man from Ghostbusters, saying: "That is one good-looking baby."
