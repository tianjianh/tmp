[SN]TITLE[SN]
Coldingham Bay beach hut expansion plans approved

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Plans to increase the number of colourful beach huts on a stretch of Borders coastline have been approved.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
There are already 60 huts at Coldingham Bay in Berwickshire but another 11 could now be built.
The approval will also allow for the replacement or alteration of the existing huts but with strict conditions on structure and colour.
A council planning officer said it was hoped that would help create a more "uniform appearance" in the area.
The huts are owned by Scottish Borders Council and leased to tenants.
Previously they had to apply individually to obtain planning consent to alter a hut, but a report said the reality was that a lot of changes had been made without seeking permission.
The latest blanket approval would allow works to be carried out according to fixed styles and colour schemes.
A council report said the introduction of new huts could also act as a "catalyst" for other tenants to upgrade their properties.
