The win moves Derry five points ahead of fourth-placed Shamrock Rovers, with the clubs meeting in Dublin on Friday night.
Derry got off to the perfect start as McNamee nipped in to put them ahead after less than 30 seconds of the contest as he latched on to Joe Crowe's back pass before rounding Brendan Clarke.
Limerick never really got over the immediate blow and they were two behind on nine minutes as defender Schubert applied the final touch after Rory Patterson's initial shot.
Ronan Curtis, recalled to the starting line-up after being left by Kenny Shiels for the win over Finn Harps because of a disciplinary issue, tested Limerick keeper Brendan Clarke as Derry continued to dominate before the break.
Limerick were unable to summon up a gallop in response in the second half and Doherty's first goal for Derry completed the scoring in the closing stages after Dean Clarke had failed to clear.
