The event in the Garnethill area, where Miss Buckley lived, follows a vigil on Friday attended by hundreds of people, including the young woman's family.
The 24-year-old's body was found on a farm near Glasgow last week, four days after she went missing on a night out.
Alexander Pacteau, 21, has appeared in court charged with the Cork woman's murder and was remanded in custody.
Mr Pacteau, from Glasgow, made no plea or declaration during the private hearing at Glasgow Sheriff Court.
Saturday's gathering to remember the student was entitled Vigil For Our Neighbour Karen Buckley.
Miss Buckley was studying at Glasgow Caledonian University and shared a flat on Hill Street, which borders the park where the event is taking place.
Organisers said they wanted to give local people a chance to remember one of their neighbours "who didn't get to come home".
Candles were being lit in the shape of a triskele - a Celtic triple spiral - in recognition of Miss Buckley's Irish roots.
On Friday, Miss Buckley's family, friends and fellow students were among about 300 mourners at a candlelit vigil held in Glasgow's George Square.
A piper played as mourners laid flowers and others sang Scottish and Irish songs before a minute's silence was held. Cards and messages were also left.
Miss Buckley's parents Marian and John, and her brothers arrived towards the end of the vigil and looked at the tributes.
Mr and Mrs Buckley earlier visited Glasgow Caledonian University (GCU) where their daughter was studying occupational health.
A special prayer service was held near her home in Mallow on Wednesday, and a fundraising page set up by Miss Buckley's former classmates to support her family has raised more than Â£50,000.
