Wales interim coach Rob Howley had anticipated the lay-off by leaving the 18-year-old out of his squad for the tournament in Tuesday's announcement.
Uncapped Giles was tipped to make his Wales debut during the series.
"At this stage we are predicting a recovery period for Keelan of approximately four weeks," said Ospreys medical officer Chris Towers.
The lay-off rules Giles out for the matches against Italy in Rome on 5 February and England in Cardiff on 11 February.
He would also be a doubt for the game against Scotland in Murrayfield on 25 February.
Ospreys also face a spell of up to five weeks without tight-head prop Fia Ma'afu whi suffered an ankle injury in the European Challenge Cup match against Lyon on Sunday, 15 January.
