Several players will face late fitness tests after picking up bumps and bruises during Saturday's 1-1 draw with Inverness Caledonian Thistle.
Rangers hand debuts to defenders David Bates, 20, and Myles Beerman, 18.
Lee Wallace, Rob Kiernan and Clint Hill miss out through injury and Lee Hodson is ill but James Tavernier returns from a ban and Danny Wilson is fit again.
Manager Pedro Caixinha has already named his team and, in addition to losing all four defenders who started Saturday's 1-1 draw with Motherwell, he makes two other changes.
Andy Halliday comes in for Jon Toral, with the on-loan Arsenal midfielder not risked on the artificial surface because of previous knee surgery. Joe Garner replaces Kenny Miller up front.
Midfielders Jordan Rossiter  and Niko Kranjcar are long-term injury absentees.
Kilmarnock caretaker manager Lee McCulloch: "It will be a good atmosphere and a good game for the spectators.
"Their new manager has already had two games and it's still early doors.
"People are judging him already, which I just find astounding. The guy needs time.
"He's definitely got them playing a different style to the start of the season. Whether it's better or not, I won't be the judge of that.
"But I don't think it will cause us any fresh problems, because most teams in the league get the ball forward quick, ourselves included."
Rangers manager Pedro Caixinha told his club website: "For sure, we'll have a strong squad, for sure we'll have players that are looking to have that chance to say 'I'm present, I'm capable to be a Rangers player and capable to be in the first eleven'.
"We totally trust in our players in the first squad, we totally trust our players from the youth system.
"So we'll have a strong squad next match and, if we need to go to the youth system's players in order to be on the first 11 or on the substitutes, there should be no problem with that."
