Grant Elliott said his match-winning 84 that took New Zealand to the World Cup final at the expense of South Africa was a repayment to his adopted home.

Johannesburg-born Elliott, 36, who immigrated to New Zealand in 2001, hit the penultimate ball for six to seal victory in Auckland.
"I wanted to become a New Zealander and I have made it my home," said Elliott.
"It's great to repay the hospitality that everyone has shown. I love this country."
Elliott arrived at the crease with New Zealand 149-4 in the 22nd over, needing 298 from 43 overs for victory and a meeting with either Australia or India in Melbourne.
By hitting Dale Steyn for six over long-on in Auckland, he sealed the co-hosts' first appearance in a World Cup final after six previous semi-final defeats.
"That win is for the fans and the four million people in New Zealand," said Elliott. "The support has been overwhelming.
"The feeling in the team is that it is destined. That is how I felt. It feels like it was meant to be."

Elliott said he had always wanted to play in a World Cup since 1992, when his mother let him stay home to watch Australia play South Africa in Sydney in what was the Proteas' inaugural appearance at the tournament.
"I got suspended from cricket and from school for a while because I did that, but it left a massive impression on me," said Elliott.
"I thought that tournament, the coloured clothing, everything was what I wanted to do and it's funny how life works. It's amazing to be at Eden Park today to hit the winning run."
Elliott was recalled to the Black Caps squad for the World Cup after an 18-month international absence.
"He came out of the wilderness not long ago and now just played a match-winning innings in a World Cup semi-final," said New Zealand captain Brendon McCullum.
"Everyone that was here will remember it for the rest of their lives. We have given ourselves a chance of World Cup glory and I'm proud of our efforts."

After being hit for the winning runs, South Africa pace bowler Steyn sank to the turf in disappointment.
In scenes reminiscent of the famous embrace between Andrew Flintoff and Brett Lee during the 2005 Ashes, Elliott helped Steyn back to his feet to commiserate him.
"You have to feel compassion," said Elliott. "I felt quite sorry for him and a lot of the South African guy. We could have lost and it could have been me sitting there.
"To stay humble in victory and humble in defeat is part of who I am."
Elliott also revealed that he will have to miss his sister's wedding in order to prepare for Sunday's final.
"Unfortunately I'll miss her wedding, so can it go into the press that I'm sorry?" he said. "She's pretty happy for me, but I'll have to give her a special gift."
