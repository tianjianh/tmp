The threat to the lives of police officers from dissident republicans in the north west of Northern Ireland remains severe, a senior officer has said.

Supt Mark McEwan outlined a number of incidents in recent months that demonstrated the threat.
He said that from September 2014 there had been 15 bomb incidents in the Derry City & Strabane District council area.
They included seven attacks on the police.
In early August, a mortar bomb was found at Strabane cemetery and detectives believe it was an attempt to lure police officers to their death.
Supt McEwan, the police district commander for the area, said there had also been 15 shootings since September 2014, six of which were paramilitary-style attacks in which he said the victims suffered "life-changing injuries".
He also revealed that after forensic analysis it had been established that a suspected assault rifle found in the Ballycolman estate following the cemetery mortar bomb find was actually a replica firearm.
Supt McEwan said the officers under his command came from all parts of the community and were dedicated to keeping people safe.
"Because they have chosen that for a career, there is an element within this community who feel that it's OK to try to mount attacks to kill or seriously injure these people," he said.
"In doing so they have no regard for the safety of other members of the community  and in fact totally disregard that safety, whether it's about lives or, indeed in terms of disrupting community life or causing fear and intimidation."
He appealed for people in the community to come forward with information about the dissidents.
"Is this the type of activity that people within our community want to tolerate?" he said.
"I don't believe it is."
