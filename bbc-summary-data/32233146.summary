The England international has been ever-present for the Super League leaders so far this season, scoring five tries in nine games.
The 27-year-old is the second Rhinos winger to be sidelined in recent weeks after Tom Briscoe was ruled out with a shoulder injury.
"It's a massive shame for Ryan and a big blow to us," Leeds coach Brian McDermott said.
