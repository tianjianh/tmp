A social media push by Aberdeen FC fans is set to send a 1980s hit by The Human League into the official chart top 10.

Dons fans have been downloading Don't You Want Me - a number one in 1981 - as they change the lyrics to "Peter Pawlett Baby" at games.
The Official Charts Company has now said it has reached number 12 - and should breach the top 10 on Sunday if the sales trend continues.
Meanwhile, it has been announced The Human League will play T in the Park.
The band said they were "stunned and honoured" by the campaign by fans.
Peter Pawlett is a midfielder for the club.
Campaigns on Facebook and Twitter to get the single to the top of the charts snowballed since the club won the Scottish League Cup on Sunday, with the chant echoing in the background.
The song was the highest new entry in the iTunes chart on Tuesday, and has continued to climb.
The band said: "We are slightly stunned but at the same time very honoured that the fans of Aberdeen FC have chosen our song as their anthem to Peter Pawlett and their achievement in getting it so high in the charts is a real testament to both their dedication to their club and to this player in particular.
"We do, of course, wish the Aberdeen fans every success in their campaign to honour Peter by getting DYWM to number one on Sunday and, regardless of whether they succeed or not, we hope that both they and everyone involved with the club have a fantastic day at their League Cup parade this coming Sunday.
"As we believe the saying goes in Aberdeen - Come On You Reds!"
Don't You Want Me would be The Human League's first top 10 single since Tell Me When, which peaked at number six in January 1995.
The Scottish League Cup will be paraded in Aberdeen on Sunday afternoon.
T in the Park organisers have now announced The Human League will play the festival on Saturday 12 July.
