Which GoT character should sit on the Iron Throne and rule Westeros?

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The world premiere of the fifth series of Game of Thrones took place on Wednesday night at the Tower of London.

An invited few also got to see the first episode, but we know you don't like spoilers so we won't utter a word about it.
All we will say is that the battle to rule Westeros is still going strong and no-one is giving up.
But who really should be King or Queen of the seven kingdoms and sit on the Iron Throne?
We decided to ask the cast at the premiere and you'll be surprised that they didn't all say their own characters.
WARNING: There are spoilers if you haven't seen the first four series.
"Me, obviously," she said - and she was being serious.
"I just think she has been through the most and she knows how to play the game as well."
Sophie's character Sansa has lost her mother, father and brother and doesn't know where the other members of her family are. She is now under the watchful eye of Lord Baelish.
"Sansa is not naive any more. She has been in one end and out the other. She is experienced now, she knows it, she knows the politics. I just think she would be great."
Despite Tommen being the reigning King of Westeros, after his nasty older brother Joffrey died in series four, he didn't pick himself.
"I think Jaime Lannister because I love his character," he said, maybe because he is his character's father.
"In the early seasons, as an audience member you are sort of iffy about him.
"As the show has gone on, season three and season four, you realise he is actually a really good guy and I think he would make a pretty good king."
Liam did say his character to start with before going with the only logical answer.
"Look, Stannis should be on it, if you went to any lawyer they would tell you Stannis should be on the throne," he said,
"That is what we are aiming for and I feel good about that."
Stannis Baratheon does have one of the best claims to the throne, but would he make a good king?
Hannah Murray's character Gilly seems an unlikely contender, or is she?
"I was talking to the director the other day," she told Newsbeat on the red carpet.
"I said, 'I am the least likely person to sit on the throne' and he said, 'I don't know' so you never know.
"But who do I think would actually be good at it? I think Daenerys would be wonderful, she is woman of the people, she's beautiful, she's got dragons, what more do you need?"
Quite right too. And Daenerys does seem one of the most likely victors in the Games of Thrones, mainly because of the dragons.
"No-one, I don't think anyone should sit on that Iron Throne," Kit Harrington said, not really playing our game.
"The whole point of the story is how power corrupts, that is what we have been telling people from the start."
But come on Kit, if you had to choose?
"I think Daenerys is probably the closest person to be sitting on that throne or should be sitting on that throne.
"She has the right outlook on life about freeing slaves and being morally good but I think if she sat on that throne she would turn into a tyrant like everyone else."
He is not holding out much hope for the future of the seven kingdoms.
"I think Jon Snow is one of the people who really doesn't want to and that is why I like playing him."
"I think Arya, I just love her storyline," he said.
"It is so easy to empathise with her because she is a little girl in a world full of strong powerful men, she has lost her dad and she is trying to make her own way of it and she does that byâ€¦ [we had to stop there as he gave away a secret]."
At this point he also went to hug Iwan Rheon who plays his tormentor Ramsay Snow. Good news they are friends in real life.
Lord Baelish is a powerful player in the seven kingdoms but Aidan doesn't think any of that will lead to him sitting on the Iron Throne and he doesn't want that for Westeros either.
"I'd like to see someone with goodness in their hearts. Possibly Arya, possibly Daenerys, the obvious ones I suppose but I hope it [the eventual victor] is not obvious.
It is fair to say Ramsay is one of the worst characters on the show so we were glad to hear Iwan wasn't a fan of getting him to King's Landing and on the throne.
"We need to get Bran on there really, get the Starks back involved, they were the only decent ones around," he said.
Game of Thrones series five begins on 13 April on Sky Atlantic
