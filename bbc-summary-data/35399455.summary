Glasgow-based artists' postcards from home

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A small bundle of postcards landed on my desk recently, comprising views from a number of countries.

The pictures were part of a project called Postcards from Home, run by Kotryna Ula Kiliulyte, which features nine Glasgow-based artists' photographs of their homeland.
Kiliulyte came up with the idea while studying for a master's degree at the Glasgow School of Art.
Her own work explores themes such as home, belonging, migration and identity, and so it wasn't a huge step to begin work as a curator of images taken by fellow artists on a trip home.
"All I asked for was photographs that are related to the artists' home countries, be it holiday snapshots, family archive, art work, really anything," says Kiliulyte.
"The freedom was important for the overall diversity.
"The next step was for me to make a selection that works together, which meant including five pictures from one artist, because it's a small series, and maybe only one from another artist, as it stands alone really strong."
Kiliulyte found the process of curating worthwhile and plans to do more.
In fact, she has pictures from other artists that will appear in future editions.
"It was really great to look at work much more objectively than I look at my own," she says.
"It was such a nice break from agonising over a final edit for an exhibition or a book of my own.
"Group-project logistics was also something new.
"It's absolutely different from the solitary work in the studio or out in the field that I am used to.
"Curating allowed me to see or create links where they might not have been in the first place.
"And this fluidity is definitely something I want to bring into my own work.
"Glasgow is thriving with self-published [fan]zines, magazines and books, and I wanted to join the party with something slightly different."
Kiliulyte hopes the postcards will appeal to a wider market, not just those who would normally purchase art magazines.
"I really hope people are using them as intended," she says, "a few handwritten sentences, a stamp and a letterbox."
Here's a selection of the pictures from the first series.
