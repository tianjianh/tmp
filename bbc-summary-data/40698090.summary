The derby looked destined for a drab goal-less draw until former Livingston defender Cole fired his first goal in a Candystripes shirt in the 87th minute.
McEneff made sure of the victory with a second goal deep into stoppage-time.
City move back up to to third in the table, two points ahead of Shamrock Rovers.
It was the first time Kenny Shiels' men have achieved back-to-back league victories since they won their first four games of the season, and was revenge for a 2-0 home defeat by Harps in April.
Harps, battling to get clear of relegation danger, started well and City keeper Gerard Doherty did well to deny Caolan McAleer in the ninth minute.
Derry had gone into the game without striker Ronan Curtis who was left out for what the club termed disciplinary reasons.
Curtis had scored five in his last eight games, and the visitors seemed to be missing him as they struggled to make the breakthrough.
But, just when a draw seemed inevitable, a corner to the near post was not cleared and, when the ball came back in, Cole pounced with a left-foot finish which gave home keeper Ciaran Gallagher no chance.
Derry made absolutely sure of the three points when Rory Patterson laid off for McEneff to go through and round Gallagher to make it 2-0 with virtually the last kick of the game.
