Phyllida Barlow, Steve Claydon, Helen Marten and David Medalla will find out in November which of them will be the first recipient of the £30,000 prize.
The prize, which will be awarded every other year, is open to artists who have made "a significant contribution to contemporary sculpture".
The four artists will go on show at the West Yorkshire gallery in October.
Barlow, who will represent Britain at the Venice International Art Biennale later this year, said it was "a surprise and huge honour" to be shortlisted.
Her sentiments were echoed by Claydon, who said the award was "a validation... of the part played by artists in Britain who contribute toward this medium."
Marten said she was "excited" to exhibit alongside her fellow nominees, while Medalla called the prize "a palpable expression of the greatness of Barbara Hepworth as a sculptor".
The gallery that bears Hepworth's name opened in May 2011 and has since had about 1.4 million visitors.
Hepworth's granddaughter, the art historian Dr Sophie Bowness, said the award was "a fitting legacy to... one of Britain's greatest sculptors".
The prize is being funded by benefactors including TV executive David Liddiment, the art collector David Roberts and Linda Harley, founder of the LK Bennett shoe chain.
