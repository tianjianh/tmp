The 55-year-old will take charge after this summer's Rio Olympics, where under-20s boss Micale will coach the host nation's team.
Tite won two league titles, the Copa Libertadores and the World Club Cup while coaching Corinthians.
Dunga's second spell as national boss ended last week when he was sacked after Brazil were knocked out of the Copa America at the group stage.
Corinthians president Roberto de Andrade said last week that Tite had accepted an offer from the Brazilian Football Confederation (CFB).
A "furious" Andrade added: "They didn't even call us once."
Tite has coached 13 clubs including Gremio, Atletico Mineiro and Palmeiras in Brazil, and Al Ain and Al Wahda in the United Arab Emirates.
