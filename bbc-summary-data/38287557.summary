Chazelle paid tribute to Gosling and Stone as he collected the best picture award.
He told them: "Both of you (gave) more than I ever could have expected from actors... just the most transformative performances I've ever been lucky enough to film."
La La Land's other wins included best song and best score.
The film opened in just five cinemas in North America this weekend, grossing $855,000 (£678,464) for Lionsgate, according to box office estimates. The $171,000 (£135,751) average per cinema is an all-time record for a film opening in so few cinemas.
Viola Davis was named best supporting actress at the Critics' Choice Awards for her role in Fences, a family drama set in 1950s America.
She was also given the inaugural See Her Award, which honours actresses who redefine the portrayal of women in the media, after becoming the first black woman to win the Emmy for best actress in a drama last year.
Mahershala Ali won best supporting actor for his role in coming-of-age film Moonlight.
Disney film Zootopia won best animated feature.
Like the Golden Globes, the Critics' Choice Awards also honour television.

Game Of Thrones was named best drama series, while Silicon Valley picked up the best comedy series prize.
Alec Baldwin was named best guest performer in a comedy series for his turn as Donald Trump on Saturday Night Live.
It comes after the US president-elect tweeted that the sketch show is "totally biased, not funny and the Baldwin impersonation just can't get any worse".
Comedian TJ Miller hosted the awards show in Santa Monica, California, two days after he was arrested for allegedly slapping a cab driver.
He made no reference to the alleged incident.
