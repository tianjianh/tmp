Over the past 12 months, Show Racism the Red Card Wales said they have seen a big rise in schools contacting them for help in dealing with racism issues.
They want ministers to take a lead in ensuring policies are in place to stamp out the problem.
Education Cabinet Secretary Kirsty Williams said a "zero tolerance approach" should be adopted by schools.
The charity has attributed the rise to reporting of Islamic radicalisation, the migrant crisis and the Brexit vote.
In June, BBC Wales reported that Welsh public figures had said they had been subjected to racist abuse following the EU referendum result.
Show Racism the Red Card Wales campaign manager Sunil Patel said: "It is deeply worrying that racist hate complaints have increased dramatically.
"Even before the EU referendum result, racism had been on the increase across Wales, and the consistent negative reporting of migrants has fuelled the resentment.
"We been noticing anti-immigration views expressed by pupils in schools from as young as eight-years-old.
"We are extremely concerned and call for urgent action to support and protect young people in Wales."
The anecdotal trend is backed up by the findings of a survey of 435 teachers carried out by the charity.
It highlighted that one in four teachers questioned in Wales have come across a racist incident at their school in the past year.
Stuart Williams, from the NUT teaching union and chairman of Show Racism the Red Card's Wales Advisory Committee, said: "Tackling racism is the responsibility of everyone in our communities, both within the school gates and outside."
Education Secretary Ms Williams said: "I will not tolerate racism and bullying in the Welsh education system, and I expect schools and education services to also make it clear that it is entirely unacceptable and to adopt a zero tolerance approach.
"Schools are supported by our Respecting Others anti-bullying guidance which includes specific guidance relating to incidents linked to race, culture and religion.
"We have also approved further work with Show Racism the Red Card to offer teachers an opportunity to attend professional learning events during the autumn term.
"These will help equip and empower our teachers with the confidence to tackle racism and discrimination in our classrooms."
The Welsh Government said its new curriculum development - A curriculum for Wales - a curriculum for life - aims to provide teaching and learning which "encourages and supports young people to be ambitious capable learners, as well as ethical, informed citizens".
