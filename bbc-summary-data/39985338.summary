The infant's remains were found in bushes in Manor Park, Church Hill, Aldershot, at about 13:30 BST.
A group of about 10 officers and a marine unit arrived on Saturday to scour the undergrowth for clues.
Police said there were "growing concerns' for the welfare of the mother who may need "urgent medical attention".
Ch Insp Debbie Brooks of Hampshire Constabulary said: "I would like to reassure the communities of Aldershot that our priority is to ensure the welfare of the mother of the baby.
"This must be a very distressing time for the mother, however it is important that she seeks urgent medical care - I would urge her to contact us on 101, or to go to a hospital for medical attention."
Hampshire Police has appealed to any friends, relatives or healthcare workers with information to come forward.
