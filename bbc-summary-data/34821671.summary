He was taken to hospital with serious leg injuries after being found behind business premises in Kyle Square, Rutherglen, at about 15:45 on Friday.
Police believe he had been struck by a white Skoda Octavia, which was later recovered in the south side of Glasgow.
They are treating the incident as attempted murder.
The Skoda car, which was recovered by police in Croftmont Avenue, had the registration plate SG07 AAY.
The 63-year-old man was being treated in the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital, where staff described his condition as serious but stable.
Det Insp Donna Duffy said: "We are confident that this was a targeted attack on the victim who has been left with life-changing injuries.
"A dedicated team of officers are working on this inquiry to establish who is responsible and there will be additional patrols around the area to provide reassurance to the local community.
"I would appeal to anyone who witnessed the incident or saw the car involved leaving the scene to contact police.
"I would also ask anyone who noticed the car parked in Croftmont Avenue or anyone acting suspiciously in the area to get in touch."
