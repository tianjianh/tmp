[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Franck Ribery scored on his first appearance of the season as Bayern Munich prepared for Manchester City's Champions League visit on Wednesday by beating Stuttgart at the Allianz Arena.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Frenchman Ribery, who missed the World Cup with a back injury, doubled Bayern's lead with a low angled shot after coming on as a substitute.
Mario Gotze, who scored Germany's World Cup-winning goal, opened the scoring.
Spanish midfielder Xabi Alonso made his debut after his move from Real Madrid.
The German champions were missing several players through injury, including Netherlands winger Arjen Robben, who will be a doubt for City's trip to the Allianz Arena with an ankle problem.
Defender Holger Badstuber will also be a concern for midweek after coming off with a thigh injury in the first half.
Stuttgart rarely threatened as Bayern remain unbeaten three games into their Bundesliga defence.
