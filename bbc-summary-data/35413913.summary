Chelsea and West Brom have been fined by the Football Association following their ill-tempered game earlier this month.

Chelsea striker Diego Costa was at the centre of several flashpoints, including a confrontation with West Brom midfielder Claudio Yacob after being tripped during the game.
The Blues have been fined £65,000 and West Brom £35,000.
West Brom twice came from behind to earn a point at Stamford Bridge.
An FA statement said the fines had been given out because both Premier League clubs failed to "ensure their players conducted themselves in an orderly fashion".
Yacob, who had already been booked when he brought down Costa, was swiftly substituted by his manager Tony Pulis.
A few days after the incident on 13 January, Chelsea interim boss Guus Hiddink said Yacob should have been dismissed and was so frustrated with the performance of referee Anthony Taylor that he expressed his concerns to fourth official Jon Moss.
"I told him: 'This is one of the worst referees of the Premier League I have experienced'," said Hiddink.
"He said to me 'you haven't seen me yet', which was a beautiful remark I think."
