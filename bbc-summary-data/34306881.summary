[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Ramunas Macnoris is charged over separate gun attacks in Newry, County Down, early last Thursday when two men, both aged 32, were shot in the legs.
The 26-year-old, of Lambfield House, Dungannon, was also charged with having a firearm.
The accused, who is originally from Lithuania, was remanded in custody,
A detective objected to bail, saying police feared he would reoffend, flee the country or interfere with witnesses.
However, a defence lawyer argued he could be released under stringent conditions, including staying 40 miles away from Newry.
Refusing bail, the judge said there were "genuine fears" about the concerns raised by the detective.
The accused is due to appear in court again via videolink next month.
