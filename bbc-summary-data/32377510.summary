Bala high school governors reject campus plan with church

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Governors are opposing Gwynedd council plans to close a high school and two primary schools in Bala and give ownership of a new campus for three to 19-year-olds to the Church in Wales.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The board at Ysgol y Berwyn high school has rejected the plans which would also affect Ysgol Bro Tegid and Ysgol Beuno Sant, a Church in Wales Voluntary Aided School.
The council would own the playing fields and the church the buildings.
A consultation closes on 28 April.
A voluntary aided school has the same curriculum as a community school.
The governing body would include representation from the church, if the plans get the go-ahead.
Gwion Lynch, chair of the governors of Ysgol y Berwyn, said the school's board was unanimous against designating it a church school with the new campus provided on its site.
A Gwynedd council spokesman said the consultation gave people an opportunity to voice opinions which would be considered by the cabinet before a decision is made.
Canon Robert Townsend, a spokesman on educational matters for the Church in Wales, said he was not surprised some people were against the plan but added that all Church in Wales schools "are grounded in their local communities".
