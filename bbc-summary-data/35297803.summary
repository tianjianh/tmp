Danny Cipriani to miss out on Eddie Jones' first England squad

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Danny Cipriani will be overlooked when England head coach Eddie Jones names his first elite player squad before next month's Six Nations Championship.

Jones will name a 33-man squad on Wednesday, but is not set to reveal his captain for another two weeks.
Northampton hooker Dylan Hartley could replace Harlequins flanker Chris Robshaw as skipper, although Hartley has lost his place in the Saints side.
Jones, 55, recently said he will select players who "express themselves".
However, Sale fly-half Cipriani is not expected to be a part of the Australian's initial plans.
The 28-year-old, who has won 14 caps since making his debut in 2008, missed out to Saracens' Owen Farrell and Bath's George Ford in England's doomed World Cup squad.
Jones was named as England's first foreign head coach in November, replacing Stuart Lancaster.
Lancaster was sacked following the World Cup, which saw hosts England eliminated in the group stage.
A lengthening injury list means Jones will be without Exeter centre Henry Slade and back row Dave Ewers, Bath lock Dave Attwood, Leicester lock Ed Slater, Northampton props Kieran Brookes and Alex Corbisiero, and Gloucester wing Jonny May, for some, or all, of the tournament.
Exeter wing Jack Nowell and Gloucester number eight Ben Morgan should recover from less serious injuries picked up at the weekend, while Saracens lock George Kruis was taken off on a stretcher against Harlequins with concussion.
However Morgan, 26, who started England's opening World Cup match against Fiji, is unlikely to be picked.
Away from fitness issues, there are question marks over the inclusion of several World Cup squad members. Saracens centre Brad Barritt, Northampton flanker Tom Wood, Harlequins pop Joe Marler, Exeter lock Geoff Parling and Saracens scrum half Richard Wigglesworth could all be left out as Jones looks to add more pace into the team.
The 33-man group is very likely to include exciting newcomers Elliot Daly, the Wasps centre, Saracens forward Maro Itoje and Harlequins flanker Jack Clifford.
Exeter back Sam Hill and Sale Sharks number eight Josh Beaumont - son of England's 1980 Grand Slam-winning captain Bill Beaumont - have also been mentioned as potential squad debutants.
Leicester centre Manu Tuilaigi - not considered by Lancaster for the World Cup after an assault conviction - could return after 15 months out with a groin injury.
And Saracens' in-form, prolific try-scorer Chris Ashton, who won the last of his 39 caps in June 2014, plus once-capped winger Semesa Rokoduguni, of Bath, are both thought to be in Jones' plans.
Under Rugby Football Union rules, Jones can change 11 players - including code convert Sam Burgess who left rugby union after the World Cup - from Lancaster's last squad.
