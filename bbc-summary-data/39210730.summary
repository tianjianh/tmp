Derbyshire made a profit of £2,653 for the financial year ending December 2016, the sixth straight year the club has recorded a surplus.

The Division Two side also saw a record turnover, largely thanks to an increase in commercial income.
The county opened a new £2.2m business and media centre in September 2016.
"I'm extremely proud to have overseen six successive years of surplus and grown turnover to record levels," chairman Chris Grant said.
"This has been a tremendous achievement given the huge challenge that keeping a first-class county afloat entails and is an enviable track record."
Derbyshire finished bottom of the County Championship last season, failing to win a match, and went out of the One-Day Cup and T20 Blast at the group stage.
