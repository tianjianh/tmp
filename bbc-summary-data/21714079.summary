A Metropolitan Police officer who was cleared by a court of making racially offensive comments has been sacked for gross misconduct.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
PC Kevin Hughes, who worked in Newham, east London, denied using threatening words or behaviour and racially-aggravated harassment while on duty.
He was sacked for gross misconduct in relation to authority, respect and courtesy and discreditable conduct.
Another officer received a final written warning over his conduct.
Colleagues brought the behaviour of PC Hughes and PC David Hair to the attention of the senior management in the force.
The issue was initially referred to the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC).
It conducted an independent inquiry, after which the officers were summonsed.
Both officers were cleared by Westminster Magistrates' Court in November last year.
But PC Hughes was dismissed following a misconduct hearing on Thursday.
The Met said that although the case against the second officer was found proven, the hearing panel took into account the opinion of a witness that he did not intend to cause offence.
Commander Allan Gibson from the Met's Directorate of Professional Standards said: "The commissioner has made it quite clear that racism is not acceptable within the Met.
"This is a view supported by the majority of officers and staff, which has been demonstrated by those who were prepared to challenge PC Hughes.
"The public have an absolute right to expect that serving officers serving treat them and their colleagues with respect and courtesy and that they do not hold discriminatory opinions."
