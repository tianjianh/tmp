The 19-year-old from Coventry was held on suspicion of failing to disclose information about acts of terrorism.
Ali Kalantar, Mohammed Ismail and Rashid Amani, all from the city, were believed to be engaged in the conflict. Kalantar and Amani have since been reported killed, police said.
West Midlands Counter Terrorism Unit officers have bailed the man.
He was arrested on Wednesday on suspicion of failing to disclose information about acts of terrorism over the disappearance of the three men, who travelled to the Middle Eastern country in March last year, West Midlands Police said.
