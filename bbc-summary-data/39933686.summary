Unfortunately we won't be seeing the pair on our TV screens, but they are reuniting for three audio episodes.
Part of Doctor Who: The Tenth Doctor Adventures - Volume 2, the episodes will be released in November.
Exec producer Jason Haigh-Ellery said: "Getting David and Billie back together was definitely on my bucket list."
Tennant, who portrayed the Doctor on screen from 2005 until 2009, returned in the 50th anniversary special The Day of the Doctor, with Matt Smith and Sir John Hurt in 2013.
He also worked on Volume 1 of the audio dramas with Catherine Tate last year, but this is Piper's debut for Big Finish's audio books.
Piper portrayed Rose in 2005 and 2006, returning for a number of stories in 2008. She also appeared in The Day of the Doctor.
The first new audio episode will be Infamy of the Zaross by John Dorney, in which an alien invasion of Earth isn't quite what it appears to be.
In the second adventure, Sword of the Chevalier by Guy Adams, the Doctor and Rose arrive in Slough in 1791 and encounter Chevalier D'Eon, an enigmatic ex-spy who has lived his life as a woman.
Finally, in Cold Vengeance by Matt Fitton, the Tardis arrives on a vast frozen food asteroid in deep space. The episode sees the return of the Doctor's old enemies, the Ice Warriors.
Nicholas Briggs, who voices the Daleks for both TV and for the audio dramas, said: "It was such a special time for me, working with Billie and David on the TV show and it is such an honour to revisit it with them on audio."
In other Doctor Who news, Michelle Gomez has revealed that she's leaving the Doctor Who TV series.
Gomez has played villain Missy since 2014 and said she is leaving because the show's star Peter Capaldi and head writer Steven Moffat are going at Christmas.
"My pals are going so I'm going," Gomez told RadioTimes.com. "Everybody's leaving, so I'm going too. I mean, what would I do without Peter and Steven? Who would I be?
"Nah, it's done now. It's over. It's the end of a chapter."
