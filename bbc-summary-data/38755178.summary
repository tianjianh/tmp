It is understood Ysgol y Parchedig Thomas Ellis in Holyhead was closed after environmental health officers visited on Monday and is due to reopen Friday.
The school is due to shut permanently this year to be replaced by the Â£10m Ysgol Cybi "superschool" in September.
Anglesey council said the situation would be monitored.
Ailia Lewis, lollipop lady and governor at the school, said the rat was spotted by a cleaner.
"The children are delighted that they're off... but these things happen and it's better for them to be away from the school.
"It's been a good school, there's been no trouble with rats in the past," she told BBC Radio Cymru.
Some parents on a Facebook page about the school initially seemed confused over why it had shut and claimed they had not been told the reason - though it is understood a text was sent to parents to let them know.
Others said the council had done the right thing and it was not the school's fault.
A council spokesman said: "Environmental Health officers visited Ysgol y Parchedig Thomas Ellis after staff saw a rat in the building on Monday.
"Treatment is currently ongoing, and officers will continue to monitor the situation over the coming days."
