For the Brazil forward, 2016 will stand out as the year she led out her country at her home Olympics in Rio. One of eight Olympic flag-bearers at the opening ceremony, she also helped her side finish fourth in the tournament.
Marta, who champions women's football across the globe through her ambassadorial work, left Swedish side FC Rosengard in April to join the recently created Orlando Pride in the United States.

She is second on the all-time list of women's international goalscorers with 167 international goals, surpassing her hero and former USA forward Mia Hamm's tally of 158 last year and creeping closer to ex-USA international Abby Wambach's record of 184.
