Aberdeen manager Derek McInnes has urged the team and support to stick together after two disappointing defeats in Glasgow.

The Dons lost 2-1 to Rangers at Ibrox six days after being defeated in the League Cup final by Celtic.
"It's important we stay calm," McInnes said ahead of Tuesday's Premiership game with Kilmarnock. "It's two defeats in Glasgow against Celtic and Rangers.
"There's still a lot of good things going on here."
Saturday's defeat to Rangers saw Aberdeen drop to fourth in the league.
With two games in hand on Rangers and Hearts above them, Aberdeen are keen to take advantage and move back up the table.
"We've not been at home since October, we've got three home games now that we want to try and maximise," said McInnes. "If we win all three home games we go back to second in the league.
"We know what the team is capable of and hopefully we can show that. I know people are disappointed. The fans have had a tough nine days or so and I get that and we feel for them.
"But it is important that we all stick together, make sure we get some wins on the board and hopefully we come out of December in a good shape.
"I like home games under the lights and hopefully we can take advantage of that. We're used to winning at home, we enjoy playing at home, none more so than midweek games. It's a busy spell for all teams but especially for ourselves."

McInnes has been criticised by sections of the support for changing a winning team, after posting away wins over Partick Thistle and Inverness Caledonian Thistle ahead of the Old Firm double header.
"We had two wins going in to the cup final playing a certain way," he explained. "We lost the cup final and that can happen when you play a team like Celtic, but we changed the system to play against Rangers' system and to an extent it worked.
"They never got any real rhythm into their game and I thought we did a lot of good things in it."
Defender Graeme Shinnie shared his manager's frustration that his side did not do themselves justice at Hampden, while he felt bad luck went against the Dons at Ibrox.
"The Celtic game was disappointing because we didn't shown our true qualities at all," said Shinnie.
"The Rangers game was different as we were right in it and played good stuff at times. We created a couple of chances. Their goal takes a deflection and completely changes the game."
