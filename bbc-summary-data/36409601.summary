Larry Godfrey, Kieran Slater and Patrick Huston went to a recurve shoot-off and despite scores being level, had to settle for silver as Russia's arrow was closest to the centre.
Huston, of Belfast, also managed to win a bronze medal in the individual event.
Britain's women's team lost their bronze medal match to Germany, with the Ukraine side winning the gold medals.
