Johannesburg Open: Paul Waring and Stuart Manley miss out to Darren Fichardt

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
South African Darren Fichardt won an abbreviated Johannesburg Open by one shot from England's Paul Waring and Welshman Stuart Manley.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A birdie on the last gave Fichardt the tournament, reduced to three rounds because of bad weather.
Waring, 32, shared the lead with Fichardt going into Sunday and shot a three-under-par 69 to the victor's 68.
Waring and 38-year-old Manley, both seeking a maiden European Tour victory, qualify for July's Open Championship.
