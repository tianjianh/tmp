Charlton v MK Dons: Yaya Sanogo 'should be banned for season' - Robinson

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Charlton striker Yaya Sanogo should be "banned for the rest of the season" for his "disgusting" red card against MK Dons, says Dons boss Karl Robinson.

Sanogo, on loan from Arsenal, was sent off during injury-time of the 0-0 draw for appearing to elbow Dons defender Antony Kay off the ball.
"He's clearly off the ball, he's had one go and a second," said Robinson.
"Equally, Rob Hall's been clotheslined on the the far side. Some of the challenges were borderline assault."
He continued to BBC Three Counties Radio: "I was expecting to see the police in the tunnel at the end of the game because the challenges were so bad.
"I know it's about fighting and competing for survival in one of the most difficult leagues in Europe, but there's still got to be an element of control."
Addicks boss Jose Riga said after the game: "[I've] not yet [seen the Sanogo incident], but he did something silly - apologised - so I suppose he did something.
"We don't need this in our situation, certainly not.
"We are all nervous about the situation. [To not win] against a direct opponent, it's two times more difficult [to survive]."
In 2012, Dons defender Gary MacKenzie headbutted Charlton striker Yann Kermorgant at The Valley, an action for which he apologised for afterwards.
"Four years ago I sent Gary MacKenzie into the press conference to apologise to everybody for his actions," said Robinson.
"We took full responsibility and it's not an acceptable part of the game, and today it's been the reverse happened against us - he could have broken his jaw.
"Their manager didn't shake my hand until we were in the tunnel either, so it ended on a bitter note for me. But we were the better team."
The result at The Valley leaves the Dons 21st in the Championship with 10 games to play, and seven points above Charlton in 23rd.
