Dai Young believes Wasps can still win silverware

Wasps director of rugby Dai Young is looking to this weekend's Premiership trip to Exeter as the prelude to another shot at winning silverware following their European Cup failure.

Saturday's 24-17 semi-final defeat by Saracens leaves Wasps with only the Premiership to concentrate on.
A top-four finish looks highly likely for Wasps, who can all but seal second place with victory at Sandy Park.
"We've got a shot at another title," Young told BBC Sport.
"It's a sobering thought that we've got to go to Sandy Park next week, but things just roll on.
"We're disappointed with Saturday's result and that we could not go at least one step further, but we've come a long way in a relatively short space of time.
"We were a little bit short. Sarries were the better team. Experience counted. They've been there a couple of times before, but we pushed them right to the edge. And I'm really proud."
"I'd be surprised if Sarries didn't go on and win it now," said Wasps joint-captain James Haskell.
"We gave it everything we had but Saracens are a team that plays that strangling rugby and it is very difficult to make inroads.
"It all comes down to inches in the end. It's all about little margins. But we've still got a very good side, we've got to pick up the pieces and, in the Premiership, it's all still to play for."
Sunday's sell-out at Sandy Park is the fifth time this season that Exeter Chiefs have sold out a top-flight game.
Wasps will start the day in second place, four points behind Premiership leaders Saracens, whose final two games both look relative formalities against two of the bottom three - Newcastle and Worcester.
Young's side are two points clear of Exeter, knowing that a bonus-point win on Sunday would guarantee a top-two place and home advantage in the play-offs.
That would be through having most wins (15 to Exeter's 13) - no matter how many bonus points the Chiefs pick up or how they get on in their final game at Harlequins the following week.
Wasps will have to wait to see if they are without prop forward Simon McIntyre.
He was sin-binned for kicking out at England lock Maro Itoje's face at the back of a ruck in the 69th minute at the Madejski Stadium on Sunday - and has since been cited for foul play.
