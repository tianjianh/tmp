County Championship: Pietersen upstaged by Sangakkara in Cardiff

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Kevin Pietersen was upstaged by Sri Lanka star Kumar Sangakkara in his first Championship appearance for Surrey for almost two years.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Pietersen, who is hoping to resurrect his England Test career this summer, came to the wicket with his side on 111-2 against Glamorgan at Cardiff.
He struck four boundaries, but was then caught off Craig Meschede for 19.
Sangakkara, however, made an unbeaten 112 and Steven Davies weighed in with 109 not out as they closed on 363-3.
The pair collected 30 boundaries between them, plus a six by Sangakkara off spinner Dean Cosker, in an unbroken partnership of 213, as the Welsh side's attack toiled in vain to contain them.
Surrey began the game confidently with Rory Burns (50) and Zafar Ansari (48) opening up with a stand of 104.
The latter's dismissal, lbw to Andy Carter, brought in Pietersen for his first Championship innings since making 177 not out against Yorkshire in June 2013.
The South Africa-born batsman has not played for England since the 2013-14 Ashes series in Australia.
But recent changes within the England and Wales Cricket Board, including the departure of managing director Paul Downton, have rekindled his international ambitions.
He was slightly fortunate to escape when he top-edged a hook off Graeme Wagg, but then pushed at a delivery by Meschede and was caught by Colin Ingram at first slip.
It proved to be their final success as Sangakkara and Davies, both left-handers, made the most of batsman-friendly conditions.
Sangakkara, making his Championship debut for the county, was first to his century with a boundary off Carter, but Davies lost nothing by comparison in reaching the 17th first-class hundred five overs before the close.
Glamorgan bowler Craig Meschede told BBC Wales Sport:
"My first first-class wicket was Sachin Tendulkar, so it's nice to add him [Pietersen] to my numbers. He'll be my number two!
"It's nice to get a big scalp to my name and he had a lot to prove today. I'm sure he'll bounce back, but hopefully not in this game.
"It's been a tough day on a pretty flat wicket, Kumar is a fantastic player and a world-class cricketer but as a youngster I can learn a lot from it.
"We've got to hit our lengths, bowl to our fields and pick up a few wickets - then we need to get our mindset right and bat big."
Surrey wicketkeeper/batsman Steven Davies:
"Kevin missed out here but I've no doubt in my mind he will get the runs he needs to play for England again.
"He's been great at Surrey. I've never had any problems with him, and he looked great last week on a tough wicket at Oxford.
"Sangakkara was unbelievable. He's a hero of mine and to play alongside him is a great honour.
"To get that partnership with him was a special day for me."
