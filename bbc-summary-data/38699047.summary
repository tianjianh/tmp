Ex-Southampton player Gobern, 25, who joins from Mansfield Town, has signed a deal until the end of the season.
Lalkovic, 24, joins on loan from Portsmouth, who signed him from Walsall last season.
The additions follow Wednesday's captures of St Mirren full-back Jason Naismith and Shrewsbury Town winger Jim O'Brien.
"Milan is an exciting left-winger who gets forward and puts teams on the back foot," Staggies boss Jim McIntyre told the club website.
"He comes with a great pedigree having played for a number of big clubs in England and Europe, including Chelsea and Portsmouth. We tried to bring Milan in during the summer so when he became available we moved for him immediately.
"Oscar is left-footed, plays in centre midfield and at six foot three brings a real presence. He is another one we looked at in the summer so we had no hesitation in moving for him when he became available.
"Mansfield offered him a contract extension, but we are delighted he has chosen to move to Dingwall."
