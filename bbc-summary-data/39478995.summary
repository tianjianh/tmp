[SN]TITLE[SN]
Man 'attacked girl, 6, then slept in her bunk bed'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man broke into a house and sexually assaulted a young girl before falling asleep in her bunk bed, a court has been told.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Jervais Jones, 25, is accused of attacking the six-year-old in Weymouth on 18 October last year.
Prosecutors allege Mr Jones, of no fixed address, broke into the terraced house in Wyke Regis in the early hours.
He denies sexually assaulting a child and trespassing with intent to commit a sexual offence.
Bournemouth Crown Court heard the girl had been asleep in her bed when Mr Jones entered the room and removed her "onesie" pyjamas.
Jurors were told the girl later went into her parents' room and told them there was a man in her bedroom who had touched her.
Prosecutors said her stepfather found Mr Jones asleep in the child's bunk bed, naked from the waist down.
The court heard the girl's parents called police and the man was arrested.
The trial continues.
