The company said the move was part of a manufacturing restructuring plan which aimed to concentrate production into centres of excellence.
Greggs confirmed a consultation process had started with employees but declined to specify the number of jobs at risk.
The union Usdaw said 100 jobs were under threat.
A Greggs spokeswoman said: "Following the announcement in March 2016 regarding our planned Â£100m investment in our supply chain over the next five years, we are now planning the next phase of this investment.
"This will increase and reshape our manufacturing and distribution capabilities and enable us to support shop expansion of substantially more than 2,000 shops, as we continue to compete effectively in the growing food-on-the-go market."
She added: "Our proposal is that Clydesmill becomes a Combined Distribution and Production Centre of Excellence with increased shop distribution capacity for Scotland and production focused on certain products.
"These proposals will create new jobs in shops, logistics and distribution as we grow shop numbers, however, there will be fewer jobs in manufacturing.
"We have entered into a period of consultation with our people regarding the proposals."
Usdaw national officer Dave Gill said: "Greggs bakery staff are now very concerned about the future after this announcement.
"Usdaw will now enter into consultation talks with the company, where we will interrogate the business case for their proposals.
"Our priorities are to save as many jobs as possible, maximise employment in the business and seek the best possible deal for our members.
"In the meantime we are providing our members with the representation, support and advice they need at this difficult and uncertain time."
