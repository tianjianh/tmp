[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Casey Scott, 29, of Drummond Road, Skegness, strangled and stabbed Lenuta Haidemac, 28, after asking her to come to the address.
Ms Haidemac, who was a sex worker, was found dead on the bathroom floor of Scott's flat.
Scott, who had previously pleaded guilty to her murder, was sentenced at Lincoln Crown Court.
Ms Haidemac had been living in Boston, Lincolnshire, with her partner and their two children since moving to the UK in 2015.
Judge Michael Heath told Scott he killed Ms Haidemac in a "brutal" manner and ordered him to serve 19 years imprisonment before he can be considered for parole.
Det Ch Insp Diane Coulson said: "Casey Scott has never accounted for his actions so we may never know what led to Lenuta's brutal killing.
"Whatever happened that day, it left a family grieving the loss of a much-loved young woman."
