Lewis Hamilton says his relationship with Mercedes team-mate Nico Rosberg will "never be perfect" but both remain fully committed to the team.

Hamilton won his third title in 2015 as he and Rosberg combined for 12 one-two finishes over 19 races, but the year was soured by clashes between the two.
Mercedes F1 boss Toto Wolff has warned he could replace one of the drivers if their relationship damages the team.
But Hamilton said: "It is never going to be all fine and dandy."
The 30-year-old added that Mercedes "can't really complain" about the results they are delivering.
"It is never going to be perfect. But we have a winning formula. We always get a one-two when the car is ready to give a one-two," he told BBC Radio 5 live.

A year of simmering tensions came to a head at both the Japanese and US Grands Prix, when Rosberg felt Hamilton had been too aggressive while passing him at the start of the races.
After his win in Texas, which secured him his third world title, Hamilton tossed Rosberg the cap he had to wear on the podium only for his team-mate to throw it straight back at him.
"The team hired myself and Nico to do a job. We have done exactly that. We are racing and competing against each other," Hamilton added.
"It is not a family game. It is not a fun event. We are both committed to Mercedes for the long run."
