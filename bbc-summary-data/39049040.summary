Natural Resources Wales (NRW) has teamed up with Google to provide virtual walks on its street view and maps sites.
It is part of a commitment to try and get more people running, walking and mountain biking.
About 60 staff walked more than 40 routes to help create the resource.
Those featured include the boardwalks of Cors Caron and Dyfi Ynyslas nature reserve in Ceredigion and areas around the waterfalls in the Brecon Beacons.
People are given a 360 degree view on Google Street View and Google Maps, allowing them to "virtually walk" routes and plan trips.
NRW staff volunteered their time, with planning officer Max Stokes saying: "We look after loads of sites across Wales where people can go running, walking and mountain biking.
"Launching the digital maps with Google means we can now showcase these special places on a global platform.
"We hope that this 'virtual warden' experience will encourage more people to get out and enjoy the outdoors."
Those involved in the project wore a camera attached to a backpack, allowing them to capture trails only accessible on foot.
