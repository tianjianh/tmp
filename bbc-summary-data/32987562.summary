[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras is due to travel to Brussels where he will be presented with a new plan to solve Greece's debt crisis.

International creditors will detail economic reforms needed if Greece is to receive further funding.
Mr Tsipras has already said he has new proposals of his own that would involve painful concessions.
A €300m (£216m) payment from cash-strapped Greece to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) is due on Friday.
The draft deal has been put together by the IMF, the European Commission and the European Central Bank following emergency talks with German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Francois Hollande.
Mr Tsipras is to hold talks later on Wednesday with European Commission President Jean Claude Juncker.
The BBC's Chris Morris in Brussels says that while this deal may not quite be a take-it-or-leave-it offer, there appears to be little room for manoeuvre.
Patience is wearing thin after months of acrimonious negotiations, he says.
Details of the draft agreement have not been released, but a senior EU official quoted by Reuters said it covers "all key policy areas and reflects the discussions of recent weeks".
Mr Tsipras's far-left Syriza party won elections in January on a pledge to oppose deeply unpopular austerity measures imposed by Greece's creditors.
Breaking those promises would be a bitter pill for the Greek prime minister to swallow, our correspondent adds.
However, failure to reach a deal could trigger a Greek default and a potential exit from the eurozone.
On Tuesday, Mr Tsipras said he had submitted "a realistic plan for Greece to exit the crisis".
He said the plan included "concessions that will be difficult".
Syriza parliamentary spokesman Nikos Filis reiterated on Tuesday that the government would not sign an agreement that was incompatible with its anti-austerity programme.
Friday's payment is the first of four totalling €1.5bn that Greece is due to pay to the IMF in June, and it is understood that the payments could be all bundled together and repaid in a single transaction at the end of the month.
If Greece decides to repay the funds in this way, it would have to notify the IMF, but it has not yet done so.
The country remains in a four-month deadlock with international creditors over the release of €7.2bn in remaining bailout funds.
