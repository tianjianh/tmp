Despite dominating the possession in the first half, Saints could not force their way past the Barry back line.
Jordan Cotterill hit the crossbar with a long range drive for Barry after the break but Seargeant later curled home.
Adrian Cieslewicz made it 2-0 with a neat finish from an acute angle while Seargeant found his second from close range and sealed it with a late effort.
