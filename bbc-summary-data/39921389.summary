Clement became the Swans' third boss of the season after replacing Bob Bradley, who had been in charge after Francesco Guidolin was sacked in October.
The club were bottom when Clement arrived but are now safe after Hull City lost at Crystal Palace on Sunday.
The former Derby County boss has won 26 points from his 19 games in charge.
If the Premier League table was only calculated from when Clement took over, the Swans would be seventh.
Clement won manager of the month in January after winning three of his first five games in charge, but his side went six games without a win through March and April as they slipped back into a relegation battle.
Wins against Stoke, Everton and Sunderland as well as a well-earned 1-1 draw against Manchester United at Old Trafford helped turn their season around and helped them to safety.
Meanwhile, title-winning Chelsea boss Antonio Conte, Tottenham Hotspur manager Mauricio Pochettino, Burnley boss Sean Dyche, West Bromwich Albion's Tony Pulis and Bournemouth's Eddie Howe have also been nominated for the award.
