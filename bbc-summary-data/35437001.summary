The woman, who escaped from the hotel, was found at her home, BFMTV reported.
In a separate incident, police also arrested a 15-year-old high school student who brandished replica guns in a shopping mall in a Paris suburb.
France remains in a state of emergency declared in November after the deadly attacks by jihadist militants in Paris.
So-called Islamic State (IS) said it carried out the co-ordinated assaults that left 130 people dead.
The 28-year-old man arrested at the Disneyland Paris hotel was also carrying a box of ammunition and a copy of the Koran in French, BFMTV reported quoting an investigation source.
But he was not known to security sources and a police source told AFP that a preliminary investigation did not point to terrorism.
The man had said he was carrying the weapons because he feared for his safety, according to the source.
The boy arrested at the mall had threatened shoppers with replica guns in Boulogne-Billancourt, a western suburb, on Thursday evening.
He was carrying a replica assault rifle and a replica automatic pistol, Boulogne Police Commissioner Alain Veron said.
BFMTV quoted a police source as saying the boy had been seeking attention.
President Francois Hollande is seeking to extend France's state of emergency for another three months, despite opposition from human rights groups.
Earlier this week, EU policing agency Europol warned that IS was planning further attacks, with France and so-called "soft" targets at particular risk.
