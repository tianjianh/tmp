Despite a water temperature of 16C, more than 2,500 people entered the races in Loch Lomond being held throughout the day.
Events started at 09:00 with the half-mile swim and finished at 15:30 with the 5km race.
Now in its third year, the Great Scottish Swim allows swimmers of all ages and abilities to take part.
The event also hosted the national one-mile open water championship race as part of the elite competition, which saw some of the world's best open water swimmers compete against Scotland's top home-grown talent.
The Great Scottish Swim said the men's race was "extremely competitive" with 2014 Commonwealth Champion Ross Murdoch, from nearby Balloch, and Commonwealth silver medallist and World Champion Robbie Renwick taking part.
The race was won by Christian Riechert in a time of 18:05:06.
The women's race featured the two-time national US 10km champion, Christine Jennings, alongside Team GB's Keri-Anne Payne, a two-time World Champion and Olympic Silver medallist.
Ms Jennings beat Ms Payne by less than half a second to take first place.
Alex Jackson, Great Swim series event director, said: "It's great to see the appetite for open water swimming increasing, the trend for taking on longer more challenging swims shows no sign of slowing down, over 250 people will take on the 5k challenge on Saturday.
"The opportunity to swim in such an iconic location continues to resonate with our swimmers not just in Scotland but around the UK, many are travelling up to enjoy a fantastic weekend in Scotland."
