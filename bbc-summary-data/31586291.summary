Torridge parking overpayments 'should go to charity'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Thousands of pounds overpaid to parking meters in Devon should be given to charity, a council leader has said.

Torridge District Council makes about £40,000 a year from overpayments because machines at its 22 car parks do not give change.
Council leader Philip Collins is urging members to back his call for the money to be given to charities.
Last year Cornwall Council revealed it makes £300,000 a year because its parking machines do not give change.
Torridge District Council charges between 60p and 90p for up to an hour of parking and between £1.20 and £1.80 for up to two hours.
Mr Collins, who will be submitting a motion to councillors on Monday, said: "Typically £1 is used instead of 90p and we treat these overpayments as a donation.
"I think we should be open with the public and say at least we guarantee that it goes towards local charities.
"There are a number of organisations that are very important to people."
He said the Citizens Advice Bureau and women's refuges could be among those that would benefit, although the recipients would be decided when the council set its budget.
"Who knows, we may find some generous supporters give even more money in this way," said Mr Collins.
