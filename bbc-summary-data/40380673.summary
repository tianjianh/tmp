The 10th anniversary of floods in which two people died has been marked with the unveiling of a plaque.

Hundreds of people were forced from their homes in Sheffield as torrential rain hit the city on 25 June 2007.
Sheffield City Council said the plaque, at the Nursery Street riverside park, "provides a permanent tribute in remembrance of that dreadful day".
Council Leader Julie Dore said: "It also underlines the strength and resilience shown by communities."

She added that the authority was doing everything in its power to make sure "we protect our residents, homes and businesses from any future devastation".
The Nursery Street park forms part of new flood defences along the River Don.
The Lower Don Valley flood protection scheme, which is nearing completion, is one of six planned for Sheffield, at an estimated cost of Â£83m.
It involves the construction of more than 60 new flood protection measures along a five-mile stretch of the River Don.
Two people who died in the floods were Ryan Parry, 14, who was swept off his feet by the River Sheaf at Millhouses and a 68-year-old man who died when he was washed away as he got out of his car in the Wicker area.
Hundreds of people were forced to leave their homes, with villages near Rotherham amongst the worst hit, amid fears the nearby Ulley dam would collapse.
Recalling the floods, one caller told BBC Radio Sheffield she remembered seeing "a wall of water" flood her friend's house in a matter of minutes.
Another resident, Gemma Aktekin, described it as "like something out of a horror movie".
Mrs Aktekin, who spent eight months living in a caravan, said events of the day had a long-term impact, including making it virtually impossible to get flood insurance.
