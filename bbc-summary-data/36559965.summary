[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The death of the distinguished QC was announced at Londonderry Crown Court.
She served as the trial judge in the high profile case of Liam Adams, brother of Sinn FÃ©in's Gerry Adams.
Paying tribute to his predecessor, Judge Phillip Babbington extended his deepest sympathies to her husband David and son Christopher.
He said that Judge Philpott loved the city of Londonderry and its people and always fought for the city behind the scenes in judicial matters.
He added that one of Judge Philpott's great pleasures was when she was awarded the freedom of the city of London.
The accolade was given for her work on behalf of the city of Londonderry with the honourable the Irish society.
She is a former student at Richmond Lodge school and Queen's University.
Lord Chief Justice Sir Declan Morgan said Judge Philpott was a "trailblazer".
"She was the first female county court judge in Northern Ireland, and the second female to take silk in this jurisdiction.
"She was compassionate to those who came before her and had an innate sense of justice and fairness.
"Her wit, hard work and dedication to the courts, justice and the most vulnerable people in society will leave a huge void."
The chairman of the Bar of Northern Ireland, Gerald McAlinden, said Judge Philpott was "a pioneer of her profession".
"We will remember her generosity of spirit, her deep sense of humanity and her unfailing commitment to serve the interests of justice," he added.
