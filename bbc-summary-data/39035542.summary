[SN]TITLE[SN]
Guiseley 1-0 Barrow

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Kevan Hurst's early goal was enough to give Guiseley a victory at Nethermoor to move them three points clear of the relegation zone.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
There were 13 minutes gone when Hurst's low shot from a tight angle went across Barrow goalkeeper Jon Flatt and in off the far post.
Barrow, who came into the match having lost only one of their last five in the league to close in on a play-off place, responded well and had chances for Ross Hannah, Richie Bennett and Moussa Diarra.
But none of them had the beating of Jonathan Maxted, who stood firm in the Guiseley goal to help his side to a fourth win in seven outings.
