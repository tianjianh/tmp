[SN]TITLE[SN]
Oldham Athletic 0-0 Northampton Town

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Northampton extended their unbeaten league run to 27 matches after a hard-fought goalless draw at Oldham.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Rob Page's side started the better and almost went ahead after seven minutes as Matthew Taylor's free-kick - swung in from the left - was beaten away by goalkeeper Connor Ripley into the path of Alex Revell, who could only direct a first-time effort well over the crossbar.
Lee Erwin went closest for Latics in the first half. Left-back Charles Dunne made a raid into the 18-yard box and, as his shot was blocked into Lee Croft's path, he teed up Erwin, whose right-footed attempt from the edge of the area was cleared off the line by Aaron Phillips.
The second half was a drab affair with few scoring chances.
Kenji Gorre poked tamely wide from a promising break in the 88th minute as the hosts looked to break the deadlock, while Oldham substitute Calaum Jahraldo-Martin fired just over from the edge of the penalty area in added time as Stephen Robinson's hosts were left still searching for a first league goal of the campaign.
