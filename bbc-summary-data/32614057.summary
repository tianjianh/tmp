Security officials returned fire, and a gunman was reportedly killed.
It was not immediately known who carried out the attack in Kurram Agency, near the border with Afghanistan.
Security forces and police later sealed off the area.
More than 100 people were at school premises during the attack, according to Pakistan's Dawn newspaper.
