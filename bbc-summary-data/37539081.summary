Cornish Pirates joint-coach Alan Paver says his side can improve after they suffered their first Championship loss of the season at London Scottish.

The Pirates went down 25-24 in London, despite a spirited fightback after trailing 15-3 with 20 minutes to go.
Kyle Moyle and Brett Beukeboom's tries levelled the score at 18-18 before David Cherry's try put Scottish ahead.
Nicolas de Battista got a late third try for the Pirates, but it was in vain as they stay third in the league.
"The fairytale beginning was always going to come to an end. Did we deserve to win the game? No," Paver told BBC Radio Cornwall.
"We got ourselves in position to win it, but it was very scrappy and we didn't play to the best of our ability, but the show goes on.
"We knew that at some point we would be beaten and we were beaten away from home by a very good side.
"We've got way more in the tank, probably it was our poorest performance overall over 80 minutes."
