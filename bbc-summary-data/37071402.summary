Kenny, 28, lost the first race of his best-of-three semi-final to Russia's Denis Dmitriev but powered to two successive wins to progress.
Skinner, 23, needed just two races to beat Australian Matthew Glaetzer.
Sunday's final between Kenny and Skinner, who both won gold medals in the team sprint, starts at 21:04 BST.
Four-time gold medallist Kenny broke the Olympic record in his last-16 race against German Maximilian Levy, clocking 10.245 seconds.
That beat the 10.254 set by Skinner in the previous heat.
