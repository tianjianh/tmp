Bolton Wanderers chairman Ken Anderson says bonus payments owed to players will be paid this week.

Anderson responded after he received criticism from former player Dean Moxey on social media.
Moxey called the situation "a joke" on Twitter, while Anderson cited a winding-up petition hearing on 10 July as the reason for late payments.
He said in a statement: "This lack of a resolution was why the bonuses owed to the players were not paid on time."
The players are reportedly owed Â£500,000 in bonus payments after winning promotion from League One to the Championship last season.
Sports Shield - the company fronted by Dean Holdsworth which, alongside Anderson's Inner Circle Investments, completed a takeover of Bolton in 2016 - are the subject of a winding-up petition from finance company BluMarble.
In March, Anderson bought former Bolton striker Holdsworth's shares to become the majority owner.
Anderson is hopeful that a resolution can be found, but added: "I was reluctant to continue to solely fund the club with still no certainty of an agreement being reached with both parties.
"However, as I have solely funded the club with substantial amounts during these ongoing discussions over the past few months, I have agreed to continue to do so for the time being.
"Accordingly, the players will be paid the outstanding monies this week."
