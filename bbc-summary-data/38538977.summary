[SN]TITLE[SN]
Sheffield Wednesday 2-0 Huddersfield Town

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Ross Wallace's superb strike helped Sheffield Wednesday beat 10-man Huddersfield in the Championship.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Huddersfield had the better of the first-half chances, and Michael Hefele could have given them the lead when he headed wide from Aaron Mooy's corner.
But the Owls took the lead shortly after the break, Wallace smashing into the top corner from 30 yards out.
Town's Jack Payne was shown a straight red card, before Fernando Forestieri tapped in for Wednesday late on.
Moments earlier striker Sam Winnall, who joined the Owls from Barnsley on Friday, had been denied a debut goal by Terriers goalkeeper Danny Ward.
But Callum McManaman rounded the on-loan Liverpool player, before Forestieri flicked his effort into the net to extend the Owls' winning run against Huddersfield to four consecutive league games.
Carlos Carvalhal's side are now sixth in the table, just one point behind Town and five clear of seventh-placed Derby.
Huddersfield remain level on points with fourth-placed Reading, having seen an eight-match unbeaten run in all competitions come to an end.
Sheffield Wednesday head coach Carlos Carvalhal:
"It was an amazing goal from Wallace, a typical Ross Wallace goal. He deserved this goal. We gave him permission to fly and he flew to a fantastic goal.
"I didn't see the red card, I was too far away. I think Forestieri should have been given a penalty though.
"Winnall really affected the game, he's a good player and made a big impact, just like McManaman. When we win, we win together.
"I am very happy with the fans today. We felt they were with us even when the first half wasn't going our way."
Huddersfield head coach David Wagner:
"We were more dangerous in the first half but we were not clinical enough today. You have to use your opportunities.
"Three big decisions went against us; Nahki Wells was fouled in the build-up to the first goal, the red card was harsh and Forestieri might have been offside for the second goal.
"I think we shouldn't forget where we are today, against one of the best teams in the division.
"The first half was very good but the second half was only okay. After the red card, the game changed."
