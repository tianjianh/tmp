Two hundred body bags have been placed on Brighton beach in a protest to highlight the UK's response to the migrant crisis in the Mediterranean.

Amnesty International supporters are zipped into some of the bags in the first few rows, alongside a banner saying #DontLetThemDrown.
Bags are lined up in rows in front of the East Sussex resort's Big Wheel close to the pier.
The protest comes ahead of an EU leaders' meeting over the crisis.
David Cameron will attend the summit in Brussels, which will discuss a response to the growing problem.
Amnesty UK director Kate Allen said: "Until now, the UK government's response has been shameful but finally they have been woken up to the need to act.
"EU governments must now urgently turn their rhetoric into action to stop more people drowning on their way to Europe."
