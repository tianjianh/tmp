A fire crew has been verbally abused by youths while attending a deliberately lit blaze in Newport, South Wales' chief fire officer has said.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A dozen deliberate blazes were attended by South Wales fire crews in the space of eight hours on Saturday.
Huw Jakeway condemned the youths' actions towards the Duffryn firefighters at a refuse fire on Partridge Way just before 23:00 GMT.
The service said it was reviewing CCTV from the appliances.
"I really don't understand why this happens to our crews," Mr Jakeway said.
The 12 deliberate fires involved vehicles or refuse being set alight.
