A music fan was killed minutes after he was dumped beside a road "for sport" by two security guards, a jury has heard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Paul Wickerson, 32, was taken from the Brownstock festival in Essex before he died in a road accident in August 2013.
Chelmsford Crown Court heard he was taken four miles (6km) from the festival by the guards to see if he could make his way back.
Gregory Maxwell, 32, of Romford, and Brian Atkins, 49, of Ilford, deny false imprisonment and kidnap.
The trial jury heard how Mr Wickerson, from Sydney, Australia, had been at the festival in Stow Maries when he was handcuffed, bundled into a Land Rover by Mr Maxwell and Mr Atkins, and driven to a remote spot.
Andrew Jackson, prosecuting, said Mr Wickerson, who had taken cocaine, ketamine and LSD, was then released to see if he could make it back to the festival.
Mr Jackson said one of the guards was overheard describing it as "four-mile bush tucker trial" - a term used to describe challenges in the reality TV show "I'm a Celebrity, Get Me Out for Here".
He said Mr Wickerson was seen wandering in a circle "clearly the worse for drugs" in a field behind the main stage, wearing just a shirt and shorts.
"One of the defendants took him to the ground, and together they handcuffed his wrists behind his back and his ankles were handcuffed as well," said Mr Jackson.
"It was done for sport; to see if he could make his own way back. Because of the drugs, he was completely disorientated on a road with a 60mph speed limit.
"Fifteen minutes afterwards he was killed by a car: a tragic, needless accident."
The trial continues.
