Sunday's defeat for Yorkshire Carnegie by Doncaster Knights in the Championship play-offs brought an end to Kevin Sinfield's dazzling career.

As the 35-year-old retires from all forms of rugby, BBC Sport looks back on the Leeds Rhinos legend's near 20-year career across both codes.
Sinfield made his debut for the Rhinos against Sheffield Eagles in 1997, aged just 16.
Looking back on his first club appearance on the eve of his 500th career game he told BBC Radio Leeds: "I made my debut the day after I got my GCSE results and I was just a boy coming into a man's game."
The stand-off was appointed Rhinos captain in December 2002, three months after his 22nd birthday.
"I think if you'd offered me what the club has gone on to achieve back on that day in 2002 I would have snapped your hand off," he told the BBC in 2012.
"We'd lost Iestyn Harris a year and half before and Francis Cummins had been doing a great job as captain. It could have gone to any number of the senior players but fortunately I was offered the job.
"It was tough to start with because I was trying to lead blokes who were 10 years older than me and had a lot of Great Britain and England caps."
Despite his trepidation, Sinfield was a near-instant success, leading the club to their first Grand Final win in October 2004.
Sinfield was appointed England captain in October 2012, replacing club team-mate Jamie Peacock.
One year on he suffered his biggest disappointment with the national side. The hosts were leading New Zealand 18-14 in the dying seconds of their World Cup semi-final at Wembley when Shaun Johnson's last-minute try set up the Kiwis for a sensational victory.
Sinfield, who played in three World Cups, retired from international rugby league the following year.
In March 2015 Sinfield surprised the sporting world when he announced his intention to switch codes and finish his career with rugby union side Yorkshire Carnegie.
That still left him time to win three more trophies with the Rhinos, ending his league career with his first treble.
After scoring 3,698 points in 521 games for the Rhinos, Sinfield joined Carnegie on an 18-month deal in November 2015.
However, in April he announced that he would be retiring from all forms of rugby at the end of Carnegie's play-off campaign.
"I have always said that some day I will need to get a proper job and that day has now come," he said.
"I have been privileged and deeply honoured to have enjoyed a 20-year career as a professional rugby player and to retire, on my own terms rather than through injury, is something I feel lucky to be able to do."
