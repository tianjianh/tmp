[SN]TITLE[SN]
Macclesfield Town 1-4 Dagenham & Redbridge

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Dagenham bolstered their play-off prospects in the National League with an emphatic comeback win at 10-man Macclesfield.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Mitch Hancox gave the hosts an early advantage when he shot past Elliot Justham from long range.
Luke Guttridge, however, deservedly levelled matters for Dagenham five minutes before the break when he curled a free-kick around the wall and past a despairing Scott Flinders.
In the second half, Macclesfield defender Neill Byrne was red-carded when he pulled down Paul Benson in the box and Corey Whitely put John Still's men 2-1 up from the spot.
Substitute Jordan Maguire-Drew turned the away side's advantage into a commanding cushion with two late goals, the second a beautiful dink over Flinders.
