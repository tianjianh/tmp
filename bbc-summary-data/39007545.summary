[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Franky Mills, 19, shot beloved family pet Bomber in the neck with an air rifle last March, before going on to attack six more.
One, Ruby, had to be put down, another needed his leg amputated, and two had eyes removed.
Mills admitted seven counts of criminal damage and seven firearms charges.
He was sentenced at Guildford Crown Court, and was ordered to serve 12 months in a youth offenders' institute, and 12 months on licence.
In a statement read out in court, Ruby's owner said: "My son was very attached to her and she would always sleep on his bed. He took the news really badly and started struggling at school and would become very tearful and quiet.
"The person who shot our cat has changed our family forever and this is something I will never forgive or forget."
Sgt Paul Eden said: "Mills' behaviour is deeply concerning and completely unacceptable and his actions have caused a great deal of distress to a number of families."
Mills was also fined Â£100. His air weapons and ammunition were confiscated, and a restraining order was placed on his preventing him buying more for five years.
The witness who came forward and helped the police catch Mills will be awarded a Â£2,000 award from animal rights charity, PETA.
