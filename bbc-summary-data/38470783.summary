Ten people have been evacuated from a train which caught fire.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Smoke could be seen billowing out of the three-carriage train at the old railway station in Kenilworth, Warwickshire.
The engine at the front of the train set alight, the fire service said. Operator Vivarail said it was a test train and all staff were safe.
National Rail's website said trains would not run between Coventry and Leamington Spa for the rest of the day.
Services between Manchester Piccadilly and Bournemouth will divert via Solihull and not call at Birmingham International and Coventry.
More from Coventry and Warwickshire
Freelance rail journalist Fraser Pithie, who had gone down to watch the test, said the train was a recently converted London Underground test train, which had been running up and down the lines when it came to a halt at Kenilworth.
"The reason it came to a halt is that that there was a fire in the underside of the train where the equipment is," he said.
There was a considerable amount of smoke, he said, and it was too early to tell what had caused the fire - or the extent of the damage.
Vivarail had been testing the train with a view to providing extra seating on the route between Coventry and Nuneaton, Mr Pithie added.
Vivarail said the planned trial on the Coventry to Nuneaton line would be postponed.
A spokesman said the fire started in one of the detachable engine modules on one of the power cars of the class 230 train.
Everyone got off the train safely and the train will be moved to the engine depot at Tyseley.
"Until it is possible to access the engine module the cause of the fire cannot be determined," the spokesman added.
"A thorough investigation will take place in conjunction with the Railway Accident Investigation Bureau and whatever steps necessary will be undertaken."
