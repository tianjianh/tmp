The skin of glass frogs is so see-through that you can see organs that are inside its body.
They are usually found in parts of Central and South America and scientist Brian Kubicki reckons that the discovery of this new species means the wildlife in Costa Rica's mountain area - where it was found - is doing well.
The new species has a different colouring, skin texture and call. Check out the clip to see what glass frogs are like...
