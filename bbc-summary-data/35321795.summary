A charity that offers care to people dying from an incurable disease has become a major shareholder in a Scottish Premiership football team.

The Highland Hospice has been gifted a 19% share in Inverness Caledonian Thistle by an anonymous donor.
The shares are worth more than Â£573,000.
The charity said it would use the shares to raise funds for a Â£7.5m redevelopment of its centre in Inverness.
The donation makes the Highland Hospice the second biggest shareholder in ICTFC but the charity's bosses said they would not be seeking a place on the board.
Norman MacDonald, the charity's vice chairman, described the gift as "phenomenally generous" and had placed the hospice in a "very unique situation".
However, he said the hospice would be looking to raise money from selling the shares.
He told BBC Radio Scotland's Good Morning Scotland programme: "The Highland Hospice's priority is palliative care and our responsibilities are to our patients and their families."
