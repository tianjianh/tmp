John McAfee settles Intel legal action over name

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
John McAfee, known for the anti-virus software bearing his surname, has settled legal action with technology giant Intel over the commercial use of his name.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The chip-maker had warned Mr McAfee against renaming his current company - MGT Capital Investments - as "John McAfee Global Technologies".
Intel argued this amounted to trademark infringement.
It bought Mr McAfee's former company, McAfee Associates, in 2010.
The legal action has now been settled, and Mr McAfee has agreed not to use the phrases "McAfee Privacy Phone" or "John McAfee Global Technologies" in relation to cyber-security or security-related products and services.
Neither party admitted to wrongdoing in the settlement, which led to US district judge Paul Oetken dismissing the case five days later.
Mr McAfee has retained the right to use his name for advertising, promotions and presentations.
