Naheed Ali, from Manchester, was leaving Mina, near Mecca, but was not involved in the crush last Thursday, the school where she worked said.
Amanat Ali has not been able to trace his wife, 47, since they became separated after she suffered sunstroke.
The Foreign Office said it was liaising with staff in Saudi Arabia.
Mother-of-three Mrs Ali is a teaching assistant at Afifah Academy, a Muslim girls' school in Old Trafford.
She was last seen making her way back to the holy city of Mecca at 11:45 local time after completing the stoning ritual in Mina.
Head teacher Abdul Huy Malek told the BBC Mr Ali has had to view dozens of bodies in hospitals while trying to find his wife.
Mr Malek said staff at the school were "extremely worried"
"She was not involved in the stampede that took place in Mina. Naheed suffered sunstroke and was separated from the group," he said.
"She was with her husband and another teaching assistant from the school with a party of pilgrims from Manchester. They went there on 14 Sept," he said.
"She got separated from her husband in the crowds shortly before the stampede and he hasn't seen her since.
"The couple have three children here at the school - they are being looked after by family friends at the moment."
A foreign office spokesperson said: "We can confirm that a British national has been reported missing in Mina, Saudi Arabia, since 24 September.
"We are providing consular assistance to the family and are liaising with local authorities."
The crush appears to have happened when pilgrims converged at a junction in Mina.
The pilgrims were taking part in the Hajj's last major rite - throwing stones at pillars called Jamarat, where Muslims believe the devil tempted the Prophet Abraham.
