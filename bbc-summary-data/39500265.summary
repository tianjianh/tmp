Oceanic Properties wants to build the manufacturing plant on the former Vosper Thornycroft shipyard site at Woolston, Southampton.
The site, next to the 1,600-home Centenary Quay development, would see wind turbine blades made within the building, then loaded on to ships.
Southampton City Council approved the application at a meeting on Tuesday.
The proposed 13m (42.6ft) tall 3,147 sq m building would be used for manufacturing 24 hours a day, seven days a week.
Under the plans the site's external yard and its cranes can also be used between 07:00 and 19:00, seven days a week and up to 23:00 for some works.
The site's proposed working hours raised concerns from residents about noise.
Dr Ian White, who lives across the water from the site in Ocean Village, said residents could face "enormous disruption on the noise issue".
Robert Sanders director of Blade Dynamics, which is earmarked to move into the the plant, said: "Most of the time the activities will be inside with the doors closed and are generally quiet, residents outside would not generally notice us."
The proposals include a 3m-high acoustic fence along Keswick Road to reduce noise from the site.
