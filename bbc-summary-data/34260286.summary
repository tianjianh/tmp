Kneale, 32, was beaten by Russia's Vasily Mosin by three targets in the double trap final in Lonato.
However, he won gold with Matt Coward-Holley and Matt French in the non-Olympic men's team discipline.
Kneale said getting to Rio "has been tough, but to actually pull it off is amazing".
He has now become the sixth member of the British shooting team to earn a spot for next year's games in Rio.
Kneale led with a score of 142 after the qualification round but Mosin scored 29 out of 30 targets in the gold medal match, with the Manx shooter getting 26 to claim silver.
