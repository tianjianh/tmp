One of only three survivors of a shinty team's historic Camanachd Cup win in 1953 will help fire up a new generation of players for this year's final.

Alan MacLaren, 86, scored one of the goals in Lovat's 4-1 victory over Kyles Athletic in shinty's most prestigious competition 62 years ago.
Lovat face Kyles Athletic again in Saturday's final in Oban.
Mr MacLaren has been asked by Lovat's boss John MacRitchie to tell the players about the 1950s victory.
The Kiltarlity-based club has not reached the final since then.
Mr MacLaren, a former soldier, said: "I think the boys are capable of doing it.
"It will be fairly emotional, especially if we win. It's been a long time since the club won this trophy.
"Lovat were really successful after the war. The players had been in the army together and were used to comradeship."
He added: "We took a replay to win the cup in Fort William. I scored one goal that day and it was a lovely memory.
"I can remember standing on the field just before the captains went up, and the cup had to be filled with whisky before Alistair MacKinnon- who is no longer with us- went up to lift it."
