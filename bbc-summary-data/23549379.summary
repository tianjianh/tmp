Two senior detectives are facing gross misconduct hearings after a colleague was found guilty of sexually assaulting female crime victims.

Det Con Jeffrey Davies, 42, was convicted at Swansea Crown Court on Thursday of two sexual assaults and cleared of one offence of exposure.
The Independent Police Complaints Commission investigated the way his line managers dealt with allegations.
Davies faces jail for the assaults in Merthyr when sentenced on 15 August.
The Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) managed the investigation by South Wales Police (SWP) into the allegations against Davies, who was based at Merthyr Tydfil police station when the sex assaults happened in 2010.
Swansea Crown Court heard that Davies was appointed as a family liaison officer with the force to help victims of domestic violence.
But he used the position to try and persuade them to have sex with him.
Det Insp Phillip Camm and Det Sgt Richard Jones could both be sacked if the serious allegations against them of gross misconduct are upheld.
Mr Camm has been suspended from frontline duties and Mr Jones has been suspended from all duties.
"The IPCC decided on September 13 2011 to manage an investigation by the SWP anti-corruption unit into allegations of a variety of sexual offences made against DC Davies," an IPCC spokesman.
"The IPCC has also independently investigated DC Davies' line managers for how they dealt with the allegations against him.
"Detective Inspector 3105 Phillip Camm and Detective Sergeant 3879 Richard Jones will now face an SWP hearing for gross misconduct.
"The IPCC will publish further details about this once the misconduct process has concluded."
Tom Davies, IPCC commissioner for Wales, said: "This was an appalling abuse of trust by a police officer dealing with three vulnerable women who expected the police to protect them.
"Corrupt police officers who abuse the trust placed in them will be brought to justice and dealt with severely. There is no place in the police service for criminals such as Davies."
It was only urgent inquires triggered by allegations of Davies's conduct which led to one of his two victims coming forward, the IPCC revealed on Friday.
It said anti-corruption officers carried out an audit to identify the exact number of women Davies had had contact with.
As a result another female victim came forward to South Wales Police with a complaint which would never otherwise have been pursued.
