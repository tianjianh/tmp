[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Victor Wanyama's first goal for Tottenham gave them all three points against Crystal Palace.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Kenyan midfielder headed home from a corner with eight minutes to go.
Spurs had the better of the chances in a tight game with Vincent Janssen shooting wide after being played through by sub Dele Alli.
Palace's best chance fell to Yohan Cabaye but the Frenchman blasted over from 12 yards. Alan Pardew's side have now lost their opening two games.
The Eagles announced the £27m signing of Liverpool striker Christian Benteke before the match but he signed too late to feature at White Hart Lane.

Although he should have capped it with a goal, Spurs striker Vincent Janssen can be pleased with his contribution in his first start for the club.
The 22-year-old Dutchman earned his start after an impressive substitute appearance in the draw at Everton last week and continued where he had left off at Goodison Park with an industrious performance.
The £17m striker came close to opening his account for his new side but Palace keeper Wayne Hennessey did well to stop his shot on the rebound after Janssen had parried Harry Kane's initial attempt.
Janssen was playing at the head of the Tottenham attack with Kane playing behind, and the two showed a few glimpses that the partnership could work.
The mobile Janssen gave experienced Palace skipper Scott Dann a very difficult afternoon and twice drew applause from the crowd for strong challenges when tracking back.
However, he will be disappointed not to have scored his first goal for the club after miscuing badly when Alli had played him in on goal.
He took seven games to score his first goal for AZ Alkmaar last season - on this showing he will not have to wait that long this campaign.
Palace have now scored just three times in their last eight Premier League games making it clear to see why they have smashed their club record transfer to sign Benteke.
The 25-year-old Belgian might have endured a difficult season at Liverpool but has proven Premier League credentials, with 51 goals in 118 appearances.
As his touchmap shows Connor Wickham was certainly willing for the Eagles but just one touch in the opposition's area proves how tough he found it to affect the game.
Palace boss Alan Pardew told BBC Sport: "He's going to give us more dynamic play going forward, free up Connor and give us a different look.
"We knew we needed to make changes and our fans will see we are headed in the right direction."
For Benteke, and indeed Wickham, to shine they will need wingers Andros Townsend and Wilfried Zaha to have a greater impact than they had for much of Saturday's game.
Spurs manager Mauricio Pochettino, speaking to BBC Sport: "It's important to win the three points in the first game at home. I think we fully deserved it.
"I am happy for Victor [Wanyama]. It's important to score and feel the love of the supporters, and I am happy with Vincent [Janssen] - he was fantastic and created a lot of chances. The supporters see he is a fighter.
"Dele Alli had some problems - he was ill for three days this week and not 100%. We have a lot of games with the Champions League this season and we have to manage them to be in a better condition for the season."

Crystal Palace boss Alan Pardew, speaking to BBC Sport: "We had to make a substitution at a corner, and Sod's Law, it's the one that goes in. Our effort and endeavour was there to see - we matched Spurs all the way.
"We have not scored a goal yet, but I cannot fault my players. We have lost on two set plays - we are a strong set play side and we will work on it and make sure it does not happen again.
"Benteke's going to give our fans and us belief. Our players are coming back slowly but surely, but it was galling today. We need one or two more players, but we are not far away."
Tottenham are back in action at White Hart Lane on Saturday, with Liverpool the visiting team. Meanwhile, Crystal Palace play League Two's Blackpool in the EFL Cup on Tuesday.
