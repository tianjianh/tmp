A Merlin helicopter, flying from the ship, spotted a group of boats carrying about 500 people on Sunday morning.
The UK government sent the warship to aid search efforts in the Mediterranean amid a rise in the number of people dying while trying to reach Europe.
Last week, Bulwark rescued 747 people from boats off Libya's coast.
A Ministry of Defence spokeswoman said: "One of HMS Bulwark's two Merlin helicopters this morning identified four migrant vessels in distress.
"HMS Bulwark has now commenced rescue operations."
The ship was already heading towards Libya after reports 14 vessels carrying migrants had left the country's coast.
BBC defence correspondent Jonathan Beale, who is on board the Royal Navy vessel, said it was sailing south with about 12 other European vessels.
HMS Bulwark is thought to have been involved in the rescue of about 1,800 migrants in the past month.
The ships are patrolling an area of about 70,000 square miles of the central Mediterranean - looking for those migrants fleeing Africa and trying to get to Europe.
The numbers of migrants attempting to cross the Mediterranean in the hope of reaching Europe has increased by more than 10% in the first five months of 2015.
Italy's government predicts a total of 200,000 will arrive on its shores this year, up from 170,000 in 2014.
Estimates suggest more than 1,600 people have drowned so far this year trying to cross the Mediterranean.
Many are fleeing war in Libya, where Islamic State fighters are terrorising the population, fuelling instability.
Italian navy ship Driade rescued 560 of the migrants on Saturday, including women and children, while the Irish vessel Le Eithne picked up 310 people.
