[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Edinburgh University is to buy the city's former fire service headquarters.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Lauriston Place building opened as the service's headquarters in 1824 and currently houses The Edinburgh Museum of Fire.
Despite a campaign against the move, the museum will move to a new purpose-built location.
The fire building will form part of Edinburgh College of Art's plans to transform the area into a hub for arts.
Stuart Bennett, Edinburgh College of Art's acting principal, said: "We are very pleased to have been selected as the preferred bidder and look forward to breathing new life into this iconic building.
"We will now begin the process of planning for a sympathetic refurbishment that can fulfil its potential as part of a world-class college of art, of which the city of Edinburgh can be justifiably proud."
Sarah O'Donnell, Scottish Fire and Rescue Service's director of finance and contractual services, said: "We are delighted that this important building will transfer to the care of the University of Edinburgh.
"They share our understanding of the building's past and will ensure it remains an important part of Edinburgh's heritage long into the future.
"We will shortly announce plans for an exciting new home for the Museum of Fire that will underline our commitment to the continued promotion of Edinburgh's pivotal role in the history of fire and rescue."
