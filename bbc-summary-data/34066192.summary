The 27-year-old impressed off the bench in the defeat by France on Saturday, but has not done enough to be included.
Owen Farrell and George Ford are set to get the two fly-half spots, with Mike Brown and Alex Goode as the full-backs.
Coach Stuart Lancaster will confirm his squad on Thursday at 13:45 BST. The tournament, held in England and Wales, starts on 18 September.
Before the official announcement, Cipriani thanked his fans for their support but did not confirm whether or not he had made the squad.
"Can't tell you how much the support means to me," he wrote on his Facebook page.
"We all go through our journey in life and learn lessons. I know I've made mistakes..,. just a quick thanx to all the nice messages."
In response to a comment asking if he knew whether he was in the squad, Cipriani added: "Won't find out till this evening/tomorrow morning. Just a message to say thank you for the support."
Cipriani, who has also played for London Wasps and Melbourne Rebels, has been capped 14 times for England since making his debut in 2008.
