South Africa murder probe: Second man wanted over killings

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Police in South Africa are searching for a second man in connection with the murder of a Welsh couple.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Roger and Christine Solik, of Abercynon, Rhondda Cynon Taff, were found dead in Nzinga, Impendle, in February.
Police said their bodies were tied up and dumped in a river.
Xolani Brian Ndlovu, 32, is wanted on suspicion of two counts of murder, house robbery, kidnapping and theft of motor vehicle.
Police said a neighbour of the Soliks raised the alarm after noticing their house was "in a state of disarray".
Officers were called and said they found bloodstains, prompting the launch of a kidnapping investigation.
Mrs Solik, 57, originally from Mountain Ash, was spotted bound in the Inzinga river 45 miles (70km) from her Kwazulu-Natal province home on 17 February.
The body of her husband, 66, who suffered from Parkinson's disease, was found more than a mile downstream three days later.
The couple married in 1980 and emigrated to South Africa the following year.
One man, Thulani Moses Mthembu, 43, has already been arrested on suspicion of murder and appeared in court on 13 March. He is next due in court on 22 March.
