[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A safe containing £45,000 was taken on Monday from Grace's Place Cafe, in Madeira Drive, Brighton.
The men used sledgehammers to break in and escaped with the safe in a van.
Police started following the van after it triggered a speed camera, with the officers unaware it had been used in the burglary. The driver failed to stop and the van was abandoned in Coldean.
When it was taken to the police pound for routine forensic tests, officers realised it was the same one used in the burglary.
They forced entry to the back and found the safe and money.
Det Insp Clare Shiel, of Brighton CID, said: "We're pleased the burglars failed to get away with the stolen property, but our investigation continues and we now need to identify and arrest them.
"Anyone who saw this white Ford Transit being driven in a dangerous manner along the A27 out of Brighton in the early hours of Monday morning, or who may have seen it being dumped in Coldean is asked to contact us without delay."
Police said when the van sped off in Brighton after being asked to stop, it ran red lights and at times travelled on the wrong side of the road.
It was later found abandoned at 02:11 BST in Middleton Rise, Coldean.
