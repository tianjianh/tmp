England v San Marino: How Roy Hodgson's side rated in 5-0 win

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
England recorded an easy 5-0 win over the world's joint bottom side San Marino at Wembley to stay top of Euro 2016 qualifying Group E.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
There were four different England goalscorers and the defence was rarely troubled in front of a crowd of almost 56,000.
All the England players performed competently, but who shone brightest?
Check out my ratings below:
How can you rate someone who had nothing to do? Faultless?
Did you know? His first and so far only save against San Marino came four hours and 14 minutes into his career against them.
One poor piece of first-half control but otherwise a very easy first start for England.
Did you know? Was the only England outfield player to not have a shot.
Back in the side after the World Cup and marked his return with a goal. Had little to do and did it competently.
Did you know? Has already scored more goals this season (two) for club and country than he did in 2013-14 (one).
Again, little or nothing to do but came through without mishap. Can you ask any more?
Did you know? Part of an England defence that has now gone six hours and five minutes without conceding a goal.
Showed plenty of attacking ambition - and in fairness was allowed to show it by this hapless San Marino team.
Did you know? Made his first competitive appearance for England after three in friendlies.
Was there a need for both him and Jordan Henderson to play against San Marino? Solid as ever.
Did you know? Had 140 touches - the highest total he has ever recorded for England in a single match.
Voted man of the match but a fairly routine, unspectacular performance.
Did you know? Created five goalscoring chances - only Milner (nine) made more.
Quiet first half and taken off after only 45 minutes.
Did you know? Had the lowest pass completion rate (73%) of any England player.
One or two trademark darting runs in the first half but, like Liverpool team-mate Henderson, not required in the second half.
Did you know? Made 27 touches in the first half, exactly the same number as the man who replaced him, Adam Lallana.
Scored his third goal in England's two Euro 2016 qualifying games and showed once more he is a very able alternative to Daniel Sturridge.
Did you know? Has scored seven goals in his past eight games for club and country.
Played with plenty of energy. Scored one, may argue he scored two and was denied three times by San Marino keeper Aldo Simoncini.
Did you know? Only three of his 42 England goals have come from the penalty spot.
On at half-time and gave an excellent performance full of pace and enterprise. Made Welbeck's goal, could have had one himself and was decisive in increasing England's tempo.
Also created a very good impression. Great footwork and always looking to be positive.
Got on the scoresheet and looked lively.
