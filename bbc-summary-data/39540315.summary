Officers found a number casings after reports gunshots were heard in Worcester Road, Bootle, Merseyside at about 21:30 BST on Friday.
No-one was injured and an investigation is under way.
Merseyside Police has secured an order so residents in Bootle and Litherland can be searched for offensive weapons between 17:00 and 02:00 on Sunday.
The Section 60 Order under the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994 was authorised by a senior police officer.
Ch Insp Paul Court said: "The behaviour of those involved is despicable and has a direct impact on our community.
"Our aim is to deter people from committing crimes, to identify those who are likely to offend and prevent them from doing so."
